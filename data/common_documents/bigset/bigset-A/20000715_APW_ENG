<HEADLINE> Mexico Volcano Spews Ash  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   MEXICO CITY (AP) -- A large volcano outside Mexico City erupted
Friday night, spitting ash more than a mile into the air.
</P>
<P>
   Popocatepetl, a 17,886-foot-high volcano about 40 miles
southeast of Mexico City, spewed ash for about six minutes, shortly
after 8 p.m.. The ash was blown northward but did not fall over any
major population centers, according to the National Center for the
Prevention of Disasters.
</P>
<P>
   Soon after the eruption, the activity decreased and the volcano
emitted only one reported exhalation for about 15 minutes before
stabilizing, the center said.
</P>
<P>
   The volcano has been spewing vapor, ash and rock intermittently
since December 1994 after lying largely dormant since 1927.

<HEADLINE> Strong Quake Hits Japanese Islands  </HEADLINE>
By ERIC PRIDEAUX
<TEXT>
<P>
   TOKYO (AP) -- A strong earthquake jolted a string of Japanese
islands off Tokyo Saturday, slightly injuring at least two people,
damaging buildings and forcing hundreds to evacuate. The quake hit
hours after a volcano in the chain erupted.
</P>
<P>
   The magnitude 6.2 quake Saturday morning knocked down the walls
of several homes and caused power outages on Niijima island, about
105 miles south of the capital, said local official Sojiro
Miyakawa.
</P>
<P>
   The quake was among thousands that have hit the islands in
recent weeks. On July 1, a magnitude 6.4 earthquake killed a
fisherman in a car that was buried under fallen rocks on Kozushima.
</P>
<P>
   About 400 residents on Niijima were evacuating to safer areas,
said Noboru Tomita, another island official. They were traveling by
boat, as the main road was blocked by debris from landslides.
</P>
<P>
   Two people were slightly injured, said Tomita. Kyodo News agency
identified them as a 61-year-old woman and a 52-year-old man.
</P>
<P>
   Television footage showed boulders dislodged from a mountainside
resting precariously close to homes in a village on Niijima.
</P>
<P>
   Prime Minister Yoshiro Mori was meeting with a team of
crisis-response officials, national broadcaster NHK said.
</P>
<P>
   Before dawn on Saturday, a volcano on the island of Miyakejima
erupted for the fifth time in a week, spewing ash and forcing more
than 100 people to evacuate.
</P>
<P>
   The eruption of the 2,670-foot Mount Oyama shot gray ash as high
as 600 yards into the sky, the meteorological agency said.
</P>
<P>
   Friday's biggest eruption coughed up a pillar of dark smoke
1,500 yards high, creating a blizzard of whirling ash that engulfed
cars and homes on the northern part of the island below.
</P>
<P>
   Islanders have complained of mental fatigue caused by the
constant tremors. Miyakejima, home to about 4,000 people, and the
nearby islands have been rocked by more than 17,500 earthquakes in
recent weeks, including about 5,480 that are strong enough to be
felt by humans.
</P>
<P>
   Separately, 502 people from a hot-spring resort near an active
volcano in northern Japan were allowed to return home Friday after
102 days of evacuation.
</P>
<P>
   The families were among more than 13,000 people evacuated in
March, when Mount Usu erupted for the first time in 22 years.
</P>
<P>
   Many have been allowed to return home. But 1,432 people are
still staying at public facilities or at relatives' homes.

<HEADLINE> Angels 5, Dodgers 3  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES (AP) -- Darin Erstad drove in the go-ahead run with a
two-run homer off Kevin Brown in the seventh inning Friday night as
the Anaheim Angels overcame two homers by Gary Sheffield and beat
the Los Angeles Dodgers 5-3.
</P>
<P>
   Kent Bottenfield (6-7), allowed to bat in the top of the seventh
despite being down by a run, improved his career record against the
Dodgers to 6-0 and won consecutive starts for the first time since
April 30-May 5. He allowed three runs and three hits in seven
innings, striking out three and walking none for only the second
time in 18 starts.
</P>
<P>
   It marked just the second time the right-hander pitched at least
seven innings in back-to-back outings since joining the Angels in a
trade that sent All-Star center fielder Jim Edmonds to St. Louis.
</P>
<P>
   Troy Percival pitched the ninth for his 21st save in 26 chances.
</P>
<P>
   Troy Glaus triggered the pivotal rally with his 27th homer and
second in two nights, leading off the seventh with a drive halfway
up the left-field pavilion that trimmed the Dodgers' lead to 3-2.
Two outs later, Bottenfield got his second consecutive single and
scored when Erstad drove a 1-1 pitch down the right-field line for
his 18th homer and third hit of the game.
</P>
<P>
   Brown (8-3) finished the inning, but removed himself after
straining a muscle in his shoulder on a first-pitch strike to Mo
Vaughn leading off the eighth. The All-Star right-hander was
charged with four runs and nine hits in seven-plus innings -- only
the second time Brown has yielded more than three earned runs in 18
starts this season.
</P>
<P>
   Onan Masaoka relieved and gave up a double to Vaughn, who scored
Anaheim's fifth run on Garret Anderson's double.
</P>
<P>
   Sheffield homered his first two times up against Bottenfield,
whose 21 home runs allowed are the most on the Angels. The second
one gave the Dodgers a 2-1 lead in the fourth. It was Sheffield's
fifth homer against Anaheim in 13 at-bats, after hitting only five
in 141 previous at-bats against the Angels.
</P>
<P>
   Sheffield's second home run enabled the six-time All-Star to
reach the 30-homer mark for the fourth time in his 13-year career.
It was his third in two games, following an eight-game drought.
</P>
<P>
   Glaus doubled in the second inning, advanced on a groundout and
came home on a two-out single by Matt Walbeck that tied the score
at 1.
</P>
<P>
Notes: The crowd of 53,115 was the Dodgers' fourth home sellout of
the season. ... Anderson was removed for a pinch-runner in the
eighth after complaining of irritation in his right shin. ... Kevin
Stocker, whose 175 career at-bats against the Dodgers are more than
twice as many as anyone else on the Angels, went 0-for-4 against
Brown and is hitless in 16 career at-bats against the Dodgers' ace.
... Sheffield also homered twice against Anaheim's Brian Cooper on
June 3 in an 8-3 victory at Edison Field. ... Jim Leyritz, making
his third start behind the plate since the Dodgers obtained him
from the Yankees on June 20, threw out would-be basestealers Erstad
and Anderson at second base in the first and fourth innings,
respectively. ... Brown has walked more than one batter only once
in his last 11 starts. ... The Dodgers decided Friday not to place
2B Mark Grudzielanek on the disabled list, despite a viral
infection that has kept him for five games. He might be ready to
play by Monday.

<HEADLINE> Umpires Support Valentine Ejection  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON (AP) -- Mets manager Bobby Valentine should have been
ejected during the seventh inning of New York's 6-4 win over Boston
on Friday night, umpire Randy Marsh admitted after the game.
</P>
<P>
   During a wild seventh inning, both benches emptied when Mets'
catcher Todd Pratt and Boston batter Brian Daubach had words,
following Daubach asking for time when Dennis Cook was on the
mound.
</P>
<P>
   Cook appeared to take a long time before making a move to throw
a pitch.
</P>
<P>
   Both benches and bullpens emptied, but no punches were thrown.
Home plate umpire Marty Foster clearly issued a warning to both
benches before the next pitch.
</P>
<P>
   On the following pitch, Daubach singled to right, tying the game
at 3. Two pitches later, Cook hit Carl Everett and was ejected by
Foster.
</P>
<P>
   According to Rule 8.02 Sec. D-2, both the pitcher and manager
should have been ejected.
</P>
<P>
   ''Probably, technically, yes,'' said Marsh, the second base
umpire and crew chief. ''Technically, the manager should have been.
(Foster) was trying to get control in that situation. He got (Cook)
out, that's the important thing.''
</P>
<P>
   Upon being asked about the rule, Marsh said: ''(The ejection)
probably should have happened in that situation.''
</P>
<P>
   Valentine was clearly on the bench for the remainder of the
game.
</P>
<P>
   ''I was never told I was being ejected,'' Valentine said.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, Valentine was ejected from a game, and came back
later with a fake mustache and glasses, and sat on the bench.
</P>
<P>
   On April 30, Boston manager Jimy Williams was ejected after
Pedro Martinez hit Roberto Alomar, following a warning to both
teams.
</P>
<P>
   ''The same thing happened to me in Cleveland,'' Williams said
after Friday's game. ''I didn't see (Valentine). He's supposed to
be ejected automatically. That's my understanding of the rule.''

<HEADLINE> Diamondbacks 6, Rangers 1  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHOENIX (AP) -- Steve Finley homered, tripled and drove in four
runs and Armando Reynoso pitched a six-hitter as the Arizona
Diamondbacks beat the Texas Rangers 6-1 on Friday night.
</P>
<P>
   Jay Bell added an RBI double for the Diamondbacks, who snapped a
three-game losing streak against the Rangers.
</P>
<P>
   Royce Clayton hit his 14th homer for Texas.
</P>
<P>
   Reynoso (6-6) struck out five, walked none and at one point
retired eight straight hitters in pitching his seventh career
complete game. It was his first complete game since July 5, 1997,
against Florida.
</P>
<P>
   Kenny Rogers (9-7) scattered four hits over the first four
innings before running into trouble with two outs in the fifth.
</P>
<P>
   Bell beat out a slow chopper to third for a single and advanced
to third on Luis Gonzalez's single to right. Rogers walked Matt
Williams to load the bases before Finley tripled into the
right-field corner, clearing the bases for a 4-1 Diamondbacks lead.
</P>
<P>
   Arizona added an unearned run in the sixth on an error by
catcher Ivan Rodriguez.
</P>
<P>
   Damian Miller singled and one out later, Reynoso laid down a
sacrifice bunt. Rodriguez tried for the force at second but threw
high, forcing Clayton to leap high to catch the ball as Miller slid
in safely. Reynoso beat Clayton's throw to first and Bell followed
with a double to left, scoring Miller to make it 5-1.
</P>
<P>
   Finley added a solo homer in the seventh, his team-leading 26th,
to make it 6-1.
</P>
<P>
   Clayton's third-inning homer just over the left-field fence gave
the Rangers a 1-0 lead. The Diamondbacks tied the game in the
bottom of the inning when Tony Womack tripled into the right-field
corner and Bell hit an RBI grounder.
</P>
<P>
   Rogers allowed six runs -- five earned -- and 10 hits for his
second straight loss. He walked two and matched a season high with
seven strikeouts.
</P>
<P>
Notes: Womack's eighth triple tied him with Colorado's Tom Goodwin
for the NL lead. ... Clayton's 14 homers match a career high set
last season. ... Arizona is 18-6 when wearing its traditional white
uniform. ... Rogers recorded his first five outs by strikeout. ...
The first four batters in the Rangers' lineup were a combined
0-for-16 with four strikeouts. ... Rodriguez's error was his second
of the season.

   NEWARK, N.J. (AP) -- In a July 14 story about abuse allegations
against Rabbi Baruch Lanner, The Associated Press gave an
incomplete account of the nature of the relationships he
acknowledged having had with some of his former female students.
</P>
<P>
   The story said he had acknowledged having ''physical
relationships'' with the women. It should have made clear that
Lanner said he had romantic, but not sexual relationships with the
women, and that the physical contact involved was limited to
hand-holding and putting arms around one another.

   Lanner said he violated Orthodox Jewish law by having these

<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO (AP) -- Barry Bonds hit his 30th homer, and Mark
Gardner pitched seven strong innings as the San Francisco Giants
defeated the Oakland Athletics 4-2 on Friday night.
</P>
<P>
   Felipe Crespo's pinch-hit single in the seventh scored Rich
Aurilia with the go-ahead run as the Giants won for the 10th time
in 11 games.
</P>
<P>
   Gardner (6-4) allowed two runs and four hits to win his fourth
consecutive start and his 50th as a Giant. Robb Nen recorded the
final three outs for his 19th save in 24 opportunities.
</P>
<P>
   Kevin Appier (8-6) lost his second straight on the road after
opening with six consecutive wins away from Oakland. He allowed
three runs and nine hits in seven innings as the A's dropped their
third straight and 10th in the last 13.
</P>
<P>
   Bonds hit his 475th career home run in the bottom of the first
to move into an 18th-place tie on the career list with Stan Musial
and Willie Stargell.
</P>
<P>
   Bonds hit a 3-2 pitch from Appier into the deepest part of Pac
Bell Park, clearing the 421-foot sign in right center field. The
homer, which traveled an estimated 442 feet, gave the Giants a 1-0
lead.
</P>
<P>
   It was Bonds' 30th home run of the season, which moved him into
a tie with St. Louis' Mark McGwire, Cincinnati's Ken Griffey, Jr.,
and Los Angeles' Gary Sheffield for the major league lead.
</P>
<P>
   Sal Fasano, making just his 27th start of the season, gave the
A's a 2-1 lead in the third with his third home run. He hit a 1-2
offering from Gardner into the left-field seats, scoring Eric
Chavez, who had doubled to lead off the inning.
</P>
<P>
   Gardner retired the next 12 batters he faced.
</P>
<P>
   The Giants tied the score when Armando Rios, who doubled to lead
off the fifth, scored on a double play.
</P>
<P>
   Jason Giambi singled and Ben Grieve doubled to open the seventh.
One out later, Miguel Tejada hit a short fly just beyond shortstop
which Aurilia caught on the outfield grass. Giambi tried to score
on the play, but Aurilia threw him out at home.
</P>
<P>
   The Giants added a run in the ninth when Bill Miller scored on a
throwing error by second baseman Randy Velarde.Notes: The Giants placed RHP Joe Nathan on the 15-day DL with
inflammation in his right shoulder. ... RHP Scott Linebrink was
recalled from Triple-A Fresno of the PCL to take Nathan's spot on
the roster. ... A's DH John Jaha is scheduled for surgery on
Wednesday to repair a damaged left shoulder. ... Oakland RHP Omar
Olivares, on the DL with a strained right shoulder, will not return
Monday as originally hoped. His return has been pushed back to Aug.
1. ... Bonds has nine career homers against the A's. ... Crespo's
pinch hit in the seventh was his 11th of the season, tying him with
Cincinnati's Hal Morris for most in the NL. His nine RBIs ties him

<HEADLINE> Mariners 7, Padres 5  </HEADLINE>
By BERNIE WILSON
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN DIEGO (AP) -- In a wacky sequence of events, John Olerud had
a game-tying double taken away by the umpires, then hit a three-run
homer to lead the Seattle Mariners to a 7-5 win over the San Diego
Padres on Friday night.
</P>
<P>
   Olerud drove in five runs for the second time in a week, tying
his career high. He drove in Seattle's first four runs, on a double
and the homer, then followed Mike Cameron's leadoff homer in the
eighth with a solo shot. Olerud and Cameron had three hits apiece.
</P>
<P>
   Jamie Moyer (9-3) pitched six strong innings and improved to 5-0
in five starts following a Mariners loss this season. Seattle,
which leads the AL West, rebounded from Thursday's 2-1, 10-inning
loss to win for the seventh time in 11 games.
</P>
<P>
   Pinch-hitter Dave Magadan led off the ninth with his first homer
in 158 at-bats, before Kazuhiro Sasaki got three outs for his 20th
save in 22 chances.
</P>
<P>
   With runners on first and second and one out in the sixth,
Olerud doubled to left. But it turned out that first base umpire
Jim Wolf called time because a baseball had come out into fair
territory in right field near the Mariners' bullpen. No relievers
were warming up at the time.
</P>
<P>
   Mariners manager Lou Piniella stormed out of the dugout and
angrily argued, but got nowhere as he stalked from ump to ump, his
cap in hand.
</P>
<P>
   So the run came off the board, the runners went back to first
and second, and Olerud got his bat and went back to the plate. On a
1-0 pitch from Brian Meadows, Olerud drove the ball into the seats
in right for a 4-2 lead.
</P>
<P>
   Wolf was emphatic in making the home run call, running several
yards out into right field and circling his hand, as most of the
Mariners came off the bench to greet Olerud.
</P>
<P>
   Cameron and Olerud homered off Steve Montgomery in the eighth,
and Joe Oliver had an RBI single. Olerud has 10 homers and Cameron
12. San Diego's Bret Boone hit a two-run homer in the eighth, his
17th.
</P>
<P>
   Moyer allowed two runs and six hits, struck out six and walked
two. Meadows (7-7) allowed four runs and seven hits in six innings,
struck out five and walked none.
</P>
<P>
   Olerud hit an RBI double in the first, but the Padres tied it in
the second when Phil Nevin scored on shortstop Carlos Guillen's
error. It was Guillen's error on Thursday that allowed Nevin to
score from second with the winning run in the 10th inning of San
Diego's 2-1 victory. Guillen is starting in place of injured
All-Star Alex Rodriguez.
</P>
<P>
   San Diego took a 2-1 lead in the fifth when Eric Owens tripled
and scored on Ruben Rivera's infield single, a hard shot off
Guillen's glove with the infield in.
</P>
<P>
Notes: Rodriguez was put on the 15-day disabled list because of a
sprained right knee. The move was retroactive to July 8, so he'll
be eligible to be activated July 23. ... Leadoff hitter Rickey
Henderson didn't start after he was hit on the left elbow in
Thursday's loss. He was replaced in left field and in the order by
Stan Javier. ... Padres rookie Dusty Allen is 0-for-12 with five
strikeouts since being called up June 2. ... Olerud improved to
9-for-18 lifetime against Meadows, with two homers and four
doubles. ... Padres RHPs Brian Boehringer and Carlton Loewer will
both have season-ending surgeries to correct shoulder problems, but
neither procedure has been scheduled yet. Loewer never threw a
pitch this season. He started on the DL after breaking his left leg
in an offseason hunting accident, then once that healed, his
shoulder problem developed.

<HEADLINE> Secrecy, Diligence at Mideast Summit  </HEADLINE>
By LAURA KING
<TEXT>
<P>
   THURMONT, Md. -- The Mideast peace negotiations at the secluded
Camp David presidential retreat are focusing on bedrock
differences. So it should come as no surprise that by all accounts
-- and not much is being said publicly -- that progress has been an
uphill struggle.
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton tried to help bridge the divide as he met
separately Friday with Israeli Primer Minister Ehud Barak and then
separately with Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat. Later all three
delegations met for a traditional Sabbath dinner, hosted by the
Israeli prime minister.
</P>
<P>
   ''These are intractable issues,'' said White House spokesman Joe
Lockhart. ''These are issues that go to the vital interests of both
of the parties. So this is very serious.''
</P>
<P>
   What is clear is that tensions are rising at the retreat in the
Catoctin Mountains 90 miles northwest of Washington. One report had
Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat at one point earlier in the week
threatening to pack his bags and depart.
</P>
<P>
   After four days of talks, the core differences are said to
remain: the status of Jerusalem, the drawing of borders of a
Palestinian state and the fate of several million Palestinian
refugees.
</P>
<P>
   ''There are tensions every day when you're working through these
issues,'' Lockhart told reporters.
</P>
<P>
   A diplomatic source told The Associated Press that at this
stage, there was no indication either side had changed its
positions on those issues that matter most.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. officials have refused to discuss the substance of the
talks, but have freely admitted from the start that the deep
divisions between the two sides were making the negotiations a
struggle.
</P>
<P>
   In spite of that, the atmosphere is strangely informal, with
some negotiating sessions conducted as leaders stroll the wooded
paths of Camp David, where a dozen years ago equally tension-filled
peace talks were held between Israel and Egypt. Those talks led to
the Cape David Accords, and a year later an Israeli-Egyptian peace
agreement, the first between Israel and any of its Arab neighbors.
</P>
<P>
   Official photographs released by the White House and State
Department consistently show participants in casual clothes --
Clinton wearing a sweat shirt and Barak a baseball-style cap --
although Arafat has stayed with his trademark military-style
fatigues and checkered keffiyeh.
</P>
<P>
   On Friday, Secretary of State Madeleine Albright, who had served
as lead negotiator during Clinton's eight-hour absence on Thursday,
tackled another sensitive mission. She traveled to nearby
Emmitsburg, Md., to meet with seven Palestinian officials who were
disgruntled that they had not been allowed to confer personally
with Arafat.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. officials have sought to limit outside contact between the
sequestered summit participants to prevent details about the talks
from leaking out prematurely.
</P>
<P>
   In her meeting with the Palestinians, Albright acknowledged that
the going was tough at Camp David. She told the group that as the
negotiators ''work through these issues, this process is bound to
get harder,'' according to Lockhart.
</P>
<P>
   At a briefing, Lockhart was asked to confirm one report that
things had gotten so tense at one point earlier in the week that
Arafat had threatened to pack his bags and walk out. ''I didn't see
any luggage today,'' he deadpanned.
</P>
<P>
   Media reports in Israel cited Palestinian sources as saying
Arafat had been angered by an initiative put forward by the United
States, which was meant to bridge gaps between the two sides but
closely mirrored Israeli positions.
</P>
<P>
   Lockhart refused to comment on whether any American proposals
had been offered, but said, ''We certainly would not eliminate any
diplomatic initiative or effort that might help push the process
forward.''
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton is scheduled to travel to Japan on Wednesday,
but U.S. officials have said that should not be considered a
deadline for wrapping up the summit.
</P>
<P>
   The Palestinians' unofficial spokeswoman, Hanan Ashrawi, said
she did not envision any breakthrough being reached by then. The
summit, she said, ''certainly isn't going to end very soon, because
the issues have not been resolved.''

   They were not roommates. They were not boarders. And they were
not ''other non-relative.''
</P>
<P>
   Nelson checked ''unmarried partner,'' because it best described
the long-standing, committed relationship he and the other man
shared.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike past years when the nation's census was taken, gay and
lesbian groups this year have encouraged homosexuals to check the
''unmarried partner'' box so that government policy makers can get
a better idea of the size of the gay and lesbian population.
</P>
<P>
   ''In the same way that the government wants to know how many,
say, Samoans, there are in the United States, they need to know
there is a gay and lesbian population,'' said Nelson, who lives in
Washington D.C. ''We don't have little pink triangles near our
names in the telephone book, and this is a way to get some hard
numbers.''
</P>
<P>
   Nelson said it could lead to the most comprehensive statistical
look ever at America's same-sex couple population. The first
results from this year's count are scheduled to be released early
next year.
</P>
<P>
   Because no question on the Census form specifically asks about
sexuality, there is no official count of the number of homosexuals
in America. Approximately 150,000 households included same-sex
unmarried partners in 1990, the first year Census forms offered
that option, but the total was not officially part of that Census.
</P>
<P>
   Gay rights advocates contend updated numbers could influence
policy decisions at the federal, state and local level, gas and
lesbian activists say.
</P>
<P>
   For example, they might help make the argument for providing
Social Security and survivor benefits to same-sex couples, or
affect future attempts to lift bans now in effect in three states --
Mississippi, Florida and Utah -- on gay couples adopting children,
said Sean Cahill, policy director for the National Gay and Lesbian
Task Force.
</P>
<P>
   ''There's an enormous amount of public policy that flows out of
the census,'' said David Smith, spokesman for the Human Rights
Campaign, a gay rights group. ''Part of our message was this is a
process you can trust. It is highly confidential and it's used for
statistical purposes only.''
</P>
<P>
   One section on the Census form offers choices for people who are
related, such as ''father'' or ''daughter.'' The ''unmarried
partner'' box is in a section with other choices for people who
live in the same households but are not related.
</P>
<P>
   Census Bureau officials say the ''unmarried partner'' category
was added to keep up with the country's changing demographics, but
they stress there are no plans to ask directly about a person's
sexuality.
</P>
<P>
   Still, if a gay person and his or her partner both check off the
same sex, and then check off ''unmarried partner,'' the inference
is that the two individuals are admitting a same-sex relationship,
say gay and lesbian activists.
</P>
<P>
   ''What we are doing in the 2000 Census is coding the unmarried
partners of the same sex living together, so that becomes a
category. That category did not exist in 1990,'' Census Director
Kenneth Prewitt said. ''So that's already a reflection of an
attempt to maintain a Census operation which is somewhat consistent
with the change in social dynamics of this country.''
</P>
<P>
   Although Vermont recently passed a civil unions law expanding
benefits for same-sex couples, the fact that Congress and at least
30 states have passed laws denying recognition of such
''marriages'' may have made some couples uncomfortable about
checking off the ''unmarried partner'' box.
</P>
<P>
   ''A lot of gays and lesbians are a little hesitant to do that,
or think it's not important because they are not allowed to get
married,'' said Ron Lewis of Silver Spring, Md.

<HEADLINE> Oklahoma Gov. Eyed For GOP V.P.  </HEADLINE>
By TIM TALLEY
<TEXT>
<P>
   OKLAHOMA CITY (AP) -- Millions of Americans got to know Oklahoma
Gov. Frank Keating on TV as a spokesman for his state after the
carnage of the Oklahoma City bombing.
</P>
<P>
   ''He was able to put a face to that very tragic situation,''
says political consultant Neva Hill. ''He was a person who could
help bring some focus and steadiness at the helm.''
</P>
<P>
   That could serve him well as fellow Republican Gov. George W.
Bush goes about his search for a presidential running mate. By all
accounts, Keating is on Bush's list.
</P>
<P>
   But the words Keating uses in political spats back home
sometimes get him into trouble.
</P>
<P>
   He has described bad teachers as ''slugs'' and has compared
growing up as a Catholic in Tulsa to being a black in Selma, Ala.,
during the 1960s, angering some blacks.
</P>
<P>
   ''He has a reputation of shooting from the lip,'' said Don
Hoover, a Democratic media consultant in Oklahoma City. ''If he is
selected, he will have the national spotlight shine on him like it
never has before. I don't think it's going to reflect on him
favorably.''
</P>
<P>
   Not so, says veteran Republican political consultant Marc
Nuttle. ''He appeals to a broad range of people across state lines
and regions. He's the candidate who can appeal to the swing voter
and galvanize the base,'' says Nuttle.
</P>
<P>
   Keating, 56, has been low-key about a vice-presidential future.
</P>
<P>
   ''I don't expect it to happen,'' the governor said.
</P>
<P>
   But the pluses are there. He's Catholic and anti-abortion. He
supports the death penalty. And his crime-fighting reputation,
pro-business, tax-cutting agenda and aggressive campaign style
could complement Bush on a GOP ticket.
</P>
<P>
   A former FBI agent and federal prosecutor, Keating worked in the
administrations of Presidents Reagan and Bush as assistant
secretary of the treasury and associate attorney general.
</P>
<P>
   In 1990, he became general counsel and acting deputy secretary
of the Department of Housing and Urban Development under Jack Kemp,
who credited Keating for helping clean up the agency that was
embroiled in scandal in the 1980s.
</P>
<P>
   President Bush nominated Keating to the 10th U.S. Circuit Court
of Appeals. But the NAACP opposed the nomination, alleging he had
undercut fair housing laws and had made racially insensitive
remarks. The nomination was blocked by Senate Democrats.
</P>
<P>
   Keating and Bush have developed a close relationship while
serving as the chief executives of adjoining states. The governors
and their wives have visited with each other, occasionally dining
together, said Dan Mahoney, Keating's communications director.
</P>
<P>
   The governor has other friends in high places. Keating's former
secretary of state and a top political strategist, Tom Cole, is
chief of staff for the Republican National Committee.
</P>
<P>
   At home, Keating has been criticized by teachers for supporting
tax vouchers for private schools and other education changes. But
in February he signed a $168 million teacher pay raise bill -- the
largest in state history.
</P>
<P>
   Keating was accused of being an elitist when he called on state
lawmakers to pass reforms ''to make us rich.'' Although an avowed
fiscal conservative, Keating developed a road program that will
invest $3 billion in highway and turnpike construction.
</P>
<P>
   ''He's probably been the biggest borrow-and-spend governor that
Oklahoma has ever had,'' says Democrat Hoover.
</P>
<P>
   And recently he has had to explain a fishing trip he took to
Alaska, that was paid for by the Conoco Co. He said it was to drum
up business, adding: ''I will go anywhere and do anything to enrich
my state.'' ... That is ''what chief executives should do.''
</P>
<P>
   One prominent state Democrat, Gordon Melson, ridiculed it as ''a
trip by a bunch of Republican pals to have a good time.''
</P>
<P>
   Whether or not he's tapped to be vice president, political
pundits expect Keating to go places in a Bush administration.
</P>
<P>
   ''His attributes are organization, discipline, a great ability
to include everyone in decision making even though he has strong
instincts,'' says former boss Kemp.
</P>
<P>
   In the meantime, Keating should be a help on the campaign trail.
</P>
<P>
   ''He likes pressing the flesh,'' says Hill, the Oklahoma City
consultant.

<HEADLINE> Landing Procedures Dispute Settled  </HEADLINE>
By RANDOLPH E. SCHMID
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Commercial airline pilots have dropped their
opposition to certain government-required runway procedures, ending
a dispute with the Federal Aviation Administration that had
threatened to disrupt travel in the busy summer season.
</P>
<P>
   The FAA announced late Friday that an agreement has been reached
with airlines, pilots and others in the aviation industry over
so-called ''land and hold short'' procedures. The pilots had
maintained the procedures were not safe in some cases, so the FAA
said it would make changes that addressed the pilots' concerns.
</P>
<P>
   As a result, the Air Line Pilots Association said that,
effective July 17, it will lift its recommendation that its 58,000
members refuse to comply with landing clearances using that
procedure.
</P>
<P>
   When a pilot is told to land and hold short, he or she is
expected to land and then stop before crossing an intersecting
runway, allowing another plane to land or take off on that strip.
The procedure increases the number of planes that can use an
airport at the same time.
</P>
<P>
   Accepting a land and hold short clearance is up to the
discretion of the pilot in command and the pilots association
claimed the procedure posed safety concerns in some cases.
</P>
<P>
   The pilots association welcomed the settlement, in which the FAA
said it will issue new rules governing these landings by Aug. 14.
</P>
<P>
   ALPA said the recommendation to decline such landings, to be
ended in the United States beginning July 17, remains in place for
flights in Canada, where it contends procedures still need to be
improved to ensure safety.
</P>
<P>
   The FAA announcement did not report what its order would
include, but the pilots association said it ''is consistent with
all criteria that ALPA had identified as necessary for safe
operations.''
</P>
<P>
   Among the ALPA concerns were pilot training, distances between
planes, types of airports where the system is used and whether
foreign pilots would use the procedure.
</P>
<P>
   ''The FAA has instructed air traffic controllers not to issue
LAHSO clearances for any runway configuration that fails to fulfill
all the required LAHSO safeguards,'' the association said.
</P>
<P>
   A separate coalition of pilot groups reported that the under the
agreement these landings ''will take place only on runways that are
deemed safe for the procedure'' and added that pilots will conduct
the landings only after receiving appropriate training.
</P>
<P>
   That group, the Coalition of Airline Pilots Associations,
represents 27,000 pilots in the Allied Pilots Association (American
Airlines), Fedex Pilots Association, Independent Pilots
Association, Southwest Pilots Association, International
Brotherhood of Teamsters Airline Division and Teamsters Local 1224
Airborne Express Pilots.

<HEADLINE> Thailand Battles Deluge of Drugs  </HEADLINE>
By THAKSINA KHAIKAEW
<TEXT>
<P>
   BAN MAE LA NA, Thailand (AP) -- In its opium-growing days, this
mountain village was the target of a campaign to wipe out
narcotics. Now its residents, rifles in hand, are helping wage
Thailand's latest war on drugs -- against a deluge of
methamphetamines and heroin from neighboring Myanmar.
</P>
<P>
   As in other areas of the so-called ''Golden Triangle'' in
Thailand, fields where colorful but deadly opium poppies once
bloomed have been converted to rice, soybean and corn cultivation
under a successful foreign-aided effort.
</P>
<P>
   ''Domestic drug supply has been stopped, but the menace persists
because supplies keep coming from next-door Myanmar,'' says
Phornchai Khamkhiew, headman of this frontier village astride a
narcotics smuggling route. ''We can't let problems brought in by
outsiders ruin our community.''
</P>
<P>
   In one attempt to halt the inflow across a long, rugged and
porous border, the Thai army has trained villagers in 29 remote
areas to take up weapons against the traffickers. Fifteen men at
Ban Mae La Na, 404 miles northwest of the Thai capital Bangkok,
have been trained to use weapons and patrol the forests.
</P>
<P>
   Their chief opponent is the United Wa State Army, described by
the United States as the world's largest drug-trafficking
organization.
</P>
<P>
   The ethnic Wa guerrillas mass-produce heroin, which is
synthesized from poppies, and methamphetamines in laboratories
inside Myanmar and speed their penetration into Thailand.
</P>
<P>
   The United States, Western Europe and others in the world
community are deeply concerned because much of the heroin makes its
way through Thailand to addicts on their own streets. The Thais,
while also battling heroin, are focusing on methamphetamines,
widely abused by everyone from wealthy teen-agers to slum dwellers
and poor farmers.
</P>
<P>
   The Office of Narcotics Control Board estimates that 600 million
of the speed pills, worth $1.2 billion, have been smuggled into
Thailand from Myanmar this year.
</P>
<P>
   It places the number of just teen-age abusers at some 260,000,
and the cost to Thai society in suppression and medical treatment
at more than $2.6 billion.
</P>
<P>
   ''Trafficking in and abuse of methamphetamines have become
Thailand's top drug problem in recent years, supplanting heroin,''
said Pol. Lt. Gen. Komrit Patpongpanich, the top anti-narcotics
cop, in an interview.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. drug officials have also warned of increasing use of meth,
which can be made from legal chemicals, in the United States.
</P>
<P>
   The flow of drugs has severely strained relations between
Thailand and Myanmar's ruling military. The U.S. State Department
says Myanmar is the world's no. 2 producer of illegal narcotics,
after Afghanistan.
</P>
<P>
   Myanmar, also known as Burma, says it is trying to fight drugs
but gets very little foreign aid to help it.
</P>
<P>
   Thai officials believe a relocation early this year of some
50,000 Myanmar people who lived in prime opium-growing areas near
the Chinese border controlled by the Wa to a region near Thailand
has increased cross-border trafficking.
</P>
<P>
   ''We all know what the problem is, but can't go across the
border to get rid of the source,'' said Lt. Gen. Wattanachai
Chaimuanwongse, who heads narcotics suppression in northern
Thailand, which together with adjacent areas of Laos and Myanmar
forms the drug-drenched ''Golden Triangle.''
</P>
<P>
   Although gunbattles with Myanmar traffickers and Thai pushers
are not uncommon, Wattanachai and others stress that force will
never win the war. Also needed is diplomatic effort with Myanmar,
cooperation with villagers along trafficking routes and domestic
social programs to stop addiction.
</P>
<P>
   A recent drug raid in Bangkok illustrated the difficulties.
</P>
<P>
   Before dawn, 30 armed plainclothes policemen and three sniffer
dogs, accompanied by an Associated Press reporter, scoured a fetid
slum known to be awash in drugs and pills.
</P>
<P>
   ''My younger brother was an addict but he quit several months
ago,'' said Arunee Yodpet, 29, when the police barged into her home
but came away empty-handed.
</P>
<P>
   ''This community is full of drug abusers and pushers,'' she
added. ''I tell my young son not to go and play far from the house
because I'm afraid that someone might give him pills to try.''
</P>
<P>
   A few doors down, the police finally made a seizure -- three pink
pills -- and hauled away a 21-year-old suspect.
</P>
<P>
   ''Methamphetamine abuse is widespread in Bangkok's slums. Poor
people take it to escape from the hardship in daily life,'' said
one of the raiders. ''Suppression alone is not enough to solve the
problem.''

Canadian Tornado Kills at Least 5
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
   PINE LAKE, Alberta (AP) -- At least five people were killed and 38 others
were injured Friday night when a tornado touched down at a campground in the
western Canadian province of Alberta, officials said. Several hundred trailers
had been flipped upside down at the Green Acres campground and a stream of tow
trucks, ambulances, rescue divers and other emergency services were descending
on the site, about 90 miles north of Calgary. The numbers of dead and wounded
''are obviously not final yet,'' said Jim Squire, spokesman for Red Deer County.

Strong Quake Hits Japanese Islands

   TOKYO (AP) -- A strong earthquake jolted a string of Japanese islands off
Tokyo Saturday, slightly injuring at least two people, damaging buildings and
forcing hundreds to evacuate. The quake hit hours after a volcano in the chain
erupted. The magnitude 6.2 quake Saturday morning knocked down the walls of
several homes and caused power outages on Niijima island, about 105 miles south
of the capital, said local official Sojiro Miyakawa. The quake was among
thousands that have hit the islands in recent weeks. On July 1, a magnitude 6.4
earthquake killed a fisherman in a car that was buried under fallen rocks on

medicine. More than 12,000 people from around the world came together for a week
to look for solutions to an epidemic that now infects 34 million people on the
planet, 95 percent of them in the poorest regions, especially sub-Saharan
Africa. While some of those at the conference spoke of cutting-edge research

<HEADLINE> Montenegro More Visible at UN  </HEADLINE>
By NICOLE WINFIELD
<TEXT>
<P>
   UNITED NATIONS (AP) -- From his one-bedroom apartment in midtown
Manhattan, Zeljko Perovic has begun a campaign to give Montenegro a
greater voice at the United Nations, setting up a one-man
''mission'' and getting himself invited to U.N. meetings.
</P>
<P>
   One of two republics that make up what is left of the former
Yugoslavia, Montenegro has no independent legal status at the
United Nations. Montenegro and Serbia are represented together by
Belgrade's U.N. mission.
</P>
<P>
   But with tensions between the two republics increasing -- and
heightened last week with constitutional changes that seek to
reduce Montenegro's status -- Montenegro is seeking to increase its
own diplomatic visibility and garner support for its pro-Western
cause.
</P>
<P>
   ''We have to protect our interests,'' said Perovic, Montenegro's
self-proclaimed ''head of mission and U.N. liaison officer,'' in an
interview Friday.
</P>
<P>
   Montenegro is finding support in its campaign from the four
former republics that separated from Belgrade in the early 1990s:
Slovenia, Croatia, Macedonia and Bosnia-Herzegovina.
</P>
<P>
   On Friday, Slovenia circulated a second letter in three weeks on
behalf of Montenegro to the Security Council, enclosing the text of
a resolution adopted by the Montenegrin parliament rejecting the
constitutional amendments enacted by the Yugoslav federal assembly.
</P>
<P>
   The amendments aim to concentrate power in the hands of Yugoslav
President Slobodan Milosevic while reducing Montenegro's status.
One paves the way for Milosevic's re-election, the other says
parliament's upper house will be chosen by popular vote, curtailing
the influence of Montenegro's parliament, which is dominated by
Milosevic's opponents.
</P>
<P>
   Slovenia's deputy U.N. ambassador, Samuel Zbogar, said Friday
that his government had decided to help Montenegro gain greater
visibility at the United Nations because Belgrade wasn't
representing its interests here.
</P>
<P>
   That support includes circulating letters to U.N. ambassadors on
behalf of Montenegro and inviting Perovic and other Montenegrin
officials to the United Nations as ''guests'' of the Slovene
mission.
</P>
<P>
   Visitors to the non-public areas of the United Nations must be
accredited to the organization or be escorted into the building as
a ''guest'' of someone who is.
</P>
<P>
   ''They are the democratic light in Yugoslavia and you have to
support that,'' Zbogar said in an interview.
</P>
<P>
   Yugoslavia's representative at the United Nations, Vladislav
Jovanovic, has bitterly complained about what he calls Slovenia's
interference in Yugoslav internal affairs. He has also dismissed
Montenegro's quest for official, or even unofficial, recognition at
the organization.
</P>
<P>
   ''Parts of member states are not entitled to have any official
or semi-official mission within the U.N. The appearance of one
person claiming to represent Montenegro in the U.N. is totally
private business and doesn't have anything to do with the U.N.
membership,'' he said in an interview.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, as a part of Yugoslavia, Montenegro cannot be recognized
as an independent U.N. member state. It probably couldn't even get
''observer'' status, which has been granted to entities such as the
Palestine Liberation Organization.
</P>
<P>
   In their dispute with Milosevic's regime, Montenegro officials
have talked of breaking from Belgrade, but they have stopped short
of making a direct move for independence.
</P>
<P>
   Similarly, Montenegro's moves at the United Nations have not
been presented as a step toward statehood. But Zbogar and Perovic
said they were looking into ways to allow Montenegro to have some
type of other accreditation at the United Nations -- or at least be
given the same type of access as Belgrade's U.N. representatives.
</P>
<P>
   Belgrade's envoys don't have full rights at the United Nations.
In 1992, they were stripped of some membership rights following the
independence of four of its six republics. The United States,
Britain and the four former Yugoslav republics have demanded that
Belgrade apply for membership as a new country.
</P>
<P>
   Belgrade has so far refused, arguing that the independence of
its republics didn't affect the ''continuity'' of the country.
</P>
<P>
   Last month, U.S. Ambassador Richard Holbrooke raised
Yugoslavia's disputed status as one reason for limiting its access
to U.N. meetings. He successfully got the Security Council to block
Jovanovic from participating in a council debate on the Balkans,
primarily on grounds that Milosevic and other key leaders have been
indicted for war crimes.
</P>
<P>
   Montenegro's foreign minister, Branko Lukovac, attended the
Security Council debate as a guest of Slovenia, Zbogar said.

<HEADLINE> Canadian Tornado Kills at Least 5  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   PINE LAKE, Alberta (AP) -- At least five people were killed and
38 others were injured Friday evening when a tornado touched down
at a campground in the western Canadian province of Alberta,
officials said.
</P>
<P>
   Witnesses said multiple trailers were flipped upside down at the
Green Acres campground and the injured were wandering around in
search of friends and relatives. A stream of tow trucks,
ambulances, rescue divers and other emergency services descended on
the site, about 90 miles north of Calgary.
</P>
<P>
   The numbers of dead and wounded ''are obviously not final yet,''
said Jim Squire, spokesman for Red Deer County.
</P>
<P>
   The storm hit the southwest corner of Pine Lake at the
campground, witnesses said, lasted about 20 minutes and brought
hail and wind before petering out in the forest nearby.
</P>
<P>
   ''There were hundreds of people walking around with scrapes,
bruises, people being carried out on stretchers,'' said Andrew
Schultz, a weatherman for a Red Deer TV station.
</P>
<P>
   ''When you looked in the lake there was a lot of floating
debris, like wood, and it looked like parts of trailers,'' said Pat
Yates, who was visiting her mother-in-law's cabin on the opposite
side of the lake from Green Acres when the tornado hit.
</P>
<P>
   The injured were being taken to Red Deer, about 40 miles to the
northwest, and hundreds of others were evacuated to a nearby
community hall and an arena.
</P>
<P>
   The weather system that created the tornado could be seen from
Calgary, said Blair Morrow of the government agency Environment
Canada. A tornado warning had been issued for the area about the
same time the funnel cloud touched down, he said.

<HEADLINE> India Slide Survivors Promised Homes  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOMBAY, India (AP) -- Officials promised money and new housing
Saturday for survivors of a landslide that buried a Bombay
shantytown, killing at least 74 people.
</P>
<P>
   But, skeptical of the promises, some 140 survivors worried about
how to rebuild their lives after losing everything in the mud and
boulders that barreled down on their shacks Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Yasin Ahmed, a car mechanic who survived the landslide along
with his wife, brother and two sons, said doctors told him his
fractured arm will take three weeks to heal.
</P>
<P>
   ''What will my family eat till then? My brother and I are the
only breadwinners,'' Ahmed, 28, said Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   The state government of Maharashtra, of which Bombay is capital,
has promised $220 to each injured person and $550 to relatives of
the dead.
</P>
<P>
   ''It is a terrible, terrible tragedy. The government will
provide houses to the victims,'' said Sonia Gandhi, president of
the Congress Party, which is in power in the state. On Saturday,
Gandhi flew into Bombay to visit the injured at a local hospital.
</P>
<P>
   Some 140 survivors from the Azad Nagar shantytown are scattered
in nearby schools and hospitals that have been converted into
temporary relief camps.
</P>
<P>
   Most of them do odd jobs at construction sites. Like millions of
other poor migrants who arrive in Bombay in search of a better
life, these laborers built illegal homes out of mud and tin atop a
hill.
</P>
<P>
   The promise of free houses is the only ray of hope for them. But
people like Nafisa Nasibi are not convinced. Nasibi, a housewife,
is still recovering from the shock of losing her husband and
daughter.
</P>
<P>
   ''People come here and promise all kinds of things. Who knows
what we will get once these VIPs leave,'' said Nasibi, who sat
beside her 8-year-old son, who was hospitalized with a head injury.
</P>
<P>
   ''Even if we do get a place to live, I don't know what I will do
about work,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   For the first night after the landslide, no bodies were
retrieved from the debris Saturday, diminishing hopes of any
survivors. Local residents estimated some 40 people were missing
and feared they could be buried.
</P>
<P>
   Municipal authorities said they were preparing a list of
families who would be given free houses. ''The immediate need is to
provide them with houses during the rains. The rest we can look
after later,'' said Pravin Chheda, a city council member.

<HEADLINE> Sierra Leone Rescue Mission Launched  </HEADLINE>
By CLARENCE ROY-MACAULAY
<TEXT>
<P>
   FREETOWN, Sierra Leone (AP) -- The United Nations launched a
military operation Saturday to rescue some 220 peacekeepers and 11
military observers trapped inside a U.N. base in a rebel stronghold
in eastern Sierra Leone, U.N. officials said.
</P>
<P>
   ''The military rescue operation is currently going on,'' the
United Nations said in a statement delivered to journalists in
Freetown.
</P>
<P>
   The peacekeepers, mainly Indian soldiers, had been unable to
leave their base inside rebel Revolutionary United Front
headquarters of Kailahun, some 185 miles east of Freetown, since
May. The detained soldiers still had their weapons but over the
past two weeks the rebels refused to allow the U.N. force in Sierra
Leone, known as UNAMSIL, to send them food supplies by road or air.
</P>
<P>
   Recent torrential rains had also limited the detained
peacekeepers' ability to move, the statement added. The U.N.
soldiers were in a base measuring 500 by 500 yards.
</P>
<P>
   The U.N. rescue team consisted of troops from Ghana, India and
Nigeria, the statement said. U.N. force commander Indian Maj. Gen.
Vijay Jetley was personally overseeing the mission from a nearby
U.N. base in the town of Daru, according to the statement.
</P>
<P>
   ''With a distress signal received from (the detained troops in)
Kailahun, regarding the dwindling food and medical stocks, there
was no alternative to a military option,'' the statement said.
''The RUF's illegal actions, which have been universally condemned
and for which appeals had been made by UNAMSIL to the RUF for quick
resolution, yielded no results.''
</P>
<P>
   The rebels reignited Sierra Leone's eight-year civil war in May
by launching attacks on towns and capturing some 500 U.N. hostages,
who were later released after being disarmed and held for several
weeks.
</P>
<P>
   The rebels have systematically killed and maimed tens of
thousands of innocent civilians in a bid to gain power through
fear. During the war, they abandoned three different peace accords.

<P>
   FREETOWN, Sierra Leone (AP) -- A U.N. military operation Saturday
rescued all 220 peacekeepers and 11 military observers trapped by
rebels inside a U.N. base in eastern Sierra Leone, a U.N.
spokeswoman said.
</P>
<P>
   The 220 detained Indian troops, who had been unable to leave the
rebel-held town of Kailahun since May, were liberated by a U.N.
military team and were on their way by road to the nearby town of
Daru, said the spokeswoman, Hirut Befecadu.
</P>
<P>
   The group had met no resistance so far, she added.
</P>
<P>
   The 11 military observers, from various countries, were flown by
helicopter to Freetown, Befecadu said.
</P>
<P>
   No other details were immediately available.
</P>
<P>
   A U.N. statement delivered to journalists earlier Saturday
morning said the U.N. rescue team consisted of troops from Ghana,
India and Nigeria. U.N. force commander Indian Maj. Gen. Vijay
Jetley was personally overseeing the mission from a nearby U.N.

<HEADLINE> Canadian Tornado Kills Six  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   PINE LAKE, Alberta (AP) -- A tornado touched down at a crowded
campground in the western Canadian province of Alberta, tossing
trailers into a lake and killing at least six people. Seventy-nine
others were injured.
</P>
<P>
   The Green Acres campground beside Pine Lake, about 90 miles
north of Calgary, ''looked like a bomb went off,'' one witness
said. The twister, which hit about 6:30 p.m. Friday and lasted
about 20 minutes, flipped some trailers upside down and sent others
into the water, said Cpl. Patrick Webb of the Royal Canadian
Mounted Police.
</P>
<P>
   Oliver Mahoney, 32, told how he was helpless to aid a man and
baby who were sucked from a car just as he rushed to shelter his
own family from the tornado. The man and baby were killed, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Mahoney said the twister picked up his trailer on the shores of
the lake and flipped it like a matchbox, while he and eight
relatives, including his four children, aged 3 to 9, desperately
hung on inside.
</P>
<P>
   ''I told everybody to try to embrace the walls,'' he said.
''They were screaming and yelling. It was terrible. It seemed like
a bad dream. We had to climb to the top to try to get out.''
</P>
<P>
   Lightning and darkness prevented officials from searching the
trailers in the water until daybreak, Webb said. Officials believed
they had found most of those injured, he said, adding that
''tomorrow we might find more'' in the water.
</P>
<P>
   Webb said some victims were taken by helicopter to hospitals in
nearby Red Deer, as well as to Edmonton and Calgary.
</P>
<P>
   Jim Squire, spokesman for Red Deer County, revised an earlier
death toll of seven, saying six were confirmed dead.
</P>
<P>
   The storm brought hail and harsh winds as it moved across the
lake and touched down at a rural subdivision on the other side.
About a dozen homes there were seriously damaged or ruined.
</P>
<P>
   ''There were hundreds of people walking around with scrapes,
bruises, people being carried out on stretchers,'' Andrew Schultz,
a weather reporter for a Red Deer television station, said of the
campground.
</P>
<P>
   Webb said the campground, located on a hillside by the lake, had
600 spaces. People rent spots for the summer and park trailers
there that they use on weekends or when they can get away. While
the campground was ''pretty full,'' he said, it wasn't clear how
many people were there when the storm hit.
</P>
<P>
   Newspaper photographer Craig Douce said the campsite looked like
''a bomb went off'' when he arrived 30 minutes after the storm.
</P>
<P>
   ''There were people partially trapped within their mangled motor
homes,'' he said, describing how he saw a man watching as his wife
was cut out of their trailer with a chain saw.
</P>
<P>
   Felicia Cacace told how her trailer suddenly lurched about with
her inside.
</P>
<P>
   ''I was flying up and down,'' she said. ''I held onto the
television, and then we crashed to the ground.''
</P>
<P>
   Mahoney said he and his family thought they were going to die.
''There's no time to think,'' he said. ''You just do a lot of
praying.''
</P>
<P>
   Mahoney suffered a broken arm and a cut foot. His mother was
admitted to the hospital in Red Deer with broken ribs. The rest of
the family was unhurt.
</P>
<P>
   Another man who was waiting to be evacuated for treatment of a
deep gouge in his left cheek said his trailer was hurled through
the air.
</P>
<P>
   ''When we landed, I was watching the ground come up. Everything
went up and it all came straight down,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Parts of trailers, wood and other debris were floating in the
lake, said Pat Yakes, who was visiting a cabin on the far side of
the lake.
</P>
<P>
   The weather system that created the tornado could be seen from
Calgary, said Blair Morrow of the government agency Environment
Canada. A tornado warning had been issued for the area about the
same time the funnel cloud touched down, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Alberta Premier Ralph Klein was traveling to the scene, said his
assistant, Gordon Turtle.
</P>
<P>
   The storm was one of the worst in Alberta since a 1987 tornado
in Edmonton killed 27 people and injured 300.

<HEADLINE> Marriage Penalty Next on Tax Agenda  </HEADLINE>
By CURT ANDERSON
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Now that they've sent President Clinton a bill
to eliminate inheritance taxes, congressional Republicans will turn
their attention to another priority: easing the income tax
''marriage penalty'' paid by millions of couples.
</P>
<P>
   The Senate opened debate Friday on a 10-year, $248 billion
measure that would essentially cut taxes for all married couples by
adjusting their tax brackets and by increasing their standard
deduction to twice that of single taxpayers.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton called the elimination of the estate tax an
irresponsible budget buster that will reward the nation's
wealthiest people while burdening working families with increased
taxes. He vowed to veto it. He also opposes changes in the marriage
penalty unless Congress agrees to create an acceptable Medicare
prescription drug benefit. Republicans have refused to link the
two.
</P>
<P>
   In his weekly radio address Saturday, Clinton called the estate
tax repeal ''fiscally irresponsible.''
</P>
<P>
   ''Its costs would explode to $750 billion after 10 years, and
every year fully half its benefits would go to just 3,000
families,'' said the president. He said the legislation and other
recent Republican congressional actions amount to ''an about-face
on our strategy of fiscal discipline.''
</P>
<P>
   Accusing Republicans of ''serving special interests, not our
national interest,'' Clinton said Congress has done nothing to
provide a prescription drug benefit for older Americans or ''add
even a day to the life of Social Security or Medicare.''
</P>
<P>
   While Clinton left no doubt that he would veto a repeal of
estate taxes, he said he would accept the marriage tax measure, but
only if Republicans also send him legislation creating an
acceptable Medicare prescription drug benefit.
</P>
<P>
   No deal, say the Republicans.
</P>
<P>
   ''We're going to pass marriage penalty relief. We're not going
to do it contingent on opening up a brand new entitlement for
unlimited spending,'' said Sen. Don Nickles, R-Okla., the majority
whip.
</P>
<P>
   Democrats are offering an alternative that would simply allow a
married couple to file as single taxpayers or jointly, whichever is
better for them. But it is not likely to prevail.
</P>
<P>
   Once passed by the Senate, the tax bill will have to be
reconciled with a House version costing $182 billion over 10 years.
Republicans are likely to agree on the bigger tax cut and send it
to Clinton prior to the GOP national political convention beginning
July 31.
</P>
<P>
   Senators voted 59-39 Friday to pass the ''death tax''
elimination bill, ignoring Democratic arguments that it was a tax
cut for the very richest Americans. Sponsors portrayed the measure
as a matter of basic fairness and a remedy for a tax that punishes
success. Most Republicans were joined by nine Democrats in voting
for it.
</P>
<P>
   ''This thing is a cancer,'' said Sen. Phil Gramm, R-Texas, of
the estate tax. ''We don't want it to be left for one person.''
</P>
<P>
   Only about 2 percent of estates are now taxed by the federal
government. In 1997, about 43,000 estates out of more than 2
million deaths were affected. But supporters of repealing the tax
said many families and business owners are forced to pay thousands
of dollars to lawyers and consultants for arrangements that protect
their money from tax rates as high as 55 percent.
</P>
<P>
   ''No family, no farm and no business should have to worry about
this sort of thing,'' said Sen. William Roth, R-Del.
</P>
<P>
   The bill, which passed the House in June with support from 65
Democrats, would cut the top 55 percent estate tax rate in 2001 and
then gradually phase out all other rates, with full repeal coming
in 2010. The cost to the government was estimated at $105 billion
during the phaseout, rising to $750 billion over the following
decade.
</P>
<P>
   Rising incomes have forced more people to worry about estate
taxes. A house, a retirement plan and some insurance can quickly
put a person's estate into the tax zone -- above $675,000 for
individuals and above $1.3 million for couples, farms and small
businesses, tax experts say. These levels are already scheduled by
law to increase to $1 million for individuals and $2 million for
couples by 2006.
</P>
<P>
   Democrats contended that the few smaller businesses and family
farms struck by the estate tax could easily be helped by simply
raising exemptions in current law. The Senate, however, defeated a
Democratic substitute costing $64 billion over 10 years that would
have sharply raised the estate tax exemptions.
</P>
<P>
   ------
</P>
<P>
   The bill is H.R. 8.

<HEADLINE> Third crow tests positive for West Nile on Long Island  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	   NEW YORK (AP) - A third crow on Long Island has tested positive
for the mosquito-borne West Nile virus, county health officials
said.
</P>
<P>
   The young crow was found in a residential area of Wading River.
The bird's age might indicate it was infected this year by
mosquitoes, Suffolk County Health Commissioner Clare Bradley said
Friday.
</P>
<P>
   ''We can't say with 100 percent certainty that this is current
infection,'' Bradley said of the most recent bird found. ''The fact
that it is a fledgling indicates it might be, but it's possible
that it was somehow otherwise exposed - it could have been infected
at birth. ... We just don't know that much about this virus.''
</P>
<P>
   Bradley said there are no plans to spray the area with
insecticides because mosquito counts remain low. However, she
cautioned people to avoid going into mosquito-filled areas.
</P>
<P>
   West Nile virus can cause a range of symptoms in humans. In the
most serious cases, infection can result in encephalitis, or
swelling of the brain, and can be deadly. The elderly and those
with compromised immune systems are most at risk.
</P>
<P>
   On July 7, Bradley announced that two adult crows found in
Lindenhurst and West Babylon had tested positive for the virus but
said it was unclear whether they were infected this year.
</P>
<P>
   Bradley said the latest crow was picked up June 26 - the same
day the two previous positive Suffolk crows were picked up - and
tested positive for the West Nile virus on two of three tests.
</P>
<P>
   On Wednesday, the State Health Department announced that a
red-tailed hawk in Westchester County tested positive for the
virus, bringing to two the number of positive birds in that county
this year. Three more dead crows - for a total of seven - have
tested positive in Bergen County, N.J., authorities said Friday.
Four crows and a blue jay have tested positive this year in
Rockland.
</P>
<P>
   No crows have tested positive for the virus this year in Nassau
County or New York City, the center of last year's outbreak. The
virus caused seven deaths in 1999.
</P>
<P>
   Bradley said scientists from the Centers for Disease Control and
Prevention this week visited Babylon, where the two previous
positive crows were found. On Monday, the U.S. Geological Survey
and CDC will test perching birds near where virus-positive crows
have been found.

<HEADLINE> Big givers to both conventions benefit from federal subsidies  </HEADLINE>
By JONATHAN D. SALANT
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) - From AT&AMP;T to General Motors, several companies
hoping to save their federal subsidies from budget cuts are helping
to pay for cocktail receptions, posh dinners and other glitz at
both political parties' conventions.
</P>
<P>
   Some of the donors have anted up as much as $1 million to both
the Republican and Democratic host committees that are arranging
the entertainment and transportation at the quadrennial events.
</P>
<P>
   The donations allow them to sow good will among the federal,
state and local officials attending the GOP event in Philadelphia
later this month and the Democrats' bash in Los Angeles in August.
</P>
<P>
   The companies' good deeds will not go unnoticed. Their names
will be proudly displayed as ''primary partners,'' ''platinum and
gold benefactors'' and ''trustees'' in the convention programs and
on the literature and placards on display at the events where
executives can hobnob with Washington's elite.
</P>
<P>
   The companies say their motive is simply to advance democracy
and help defray the cost of staging the massive events.
</P>
<P>
   ''We support the democratic process,'' Lockheed Martin spokesman
James Fetig said.
</P>
<P>
   Others locked in the battle to cut what they see as wasteful
federal subsidies to wealthy companies - the critics call it
''corporate welfare'' - suspect another motive.
</P>
<P>
   ''One has got to be a moron and extremely naive to believe that
the wealthy corporations are contributing hundreds of millions of
dollars just for the fun of it,'' said Rep. Bernard Sanders, an
independent from Vermont who has led the battle against the
subsidies.
</P>
<P>
   The Democratic and Republican parties each get $13.5 million in
tax dollars to pay for their conventions.
</P>
<P>
   But the government allows corporations, unions and individuals
to donate unlimited amounts to convention host committees - and get
a tax deduction.
</P>
<P>
   Eight of the 15 companies that have donated to both conventions'
host committees benefit from the federal programs that some
lawmakers are trying to kill. They also have substantial other
business pending with the government, including contracts to
regulatory issues.
</P>
<P>
   GM and DaimlerChrysler have made sizable donations at a time
when they are fighting efforts to trim programs that fund their
research and development.
</P>
<P>
   Last month, the House voted 214-211 to cut $126.5 million, or
about half the budget, from the Partnership for a New Generation of
Vehicles, a joint venture between the government and the automakers
to develop a car that gets 80 miles per gallon. The Senate has not
decided yet whether to go along.
</P>
<P>
   GM, which has received $8.7 million under the program,
contributed more than $1 million to each convention's host
committee. DaimlerChrysler, which has gotten $19.7 million, is
supporting each to the tune of $250,000.
</P>
<P>
   Both car companies also have received millions of dollars under
the Commerce Department's Advanced Technology Program, which uses
federal and private dollars to develop new products and is another
target of the budget cutters.
</P>
<P>
   GM donated 400 cars to each convention.
</P>
<P>
   ''We consider that a marketing opportunity, making our vehicles
available to an important group of people,'' spokesman William
Noack said.
</P>
<P>
   Several other beneficiaries of the Commerce program also are big
givers to both conventions, including communications giants AT&AMP;T,
which has given $1 million to both conventions, and Verizon, the
former Bell Atlantic, which has contributed $1 million for
Philadelphia and $100,000 for Los Angeles.
</P>
<P>
   Another target of the corporate subsidy cutters is the Overseas
Private Investment Corporation, which provides loans and insurance
for companies doing business in developing countries. One OPIC
customer is McDonald's, which has contributed $50,000 to the
Philadelphia convention and $25,000 for Los Angeles. Another is the
insurance giant American International Group, a million-dollar
donor for Los Angeles and a $500,000 donor for Philadelphia.
</P>
<P>
   Keith Ashdown, a spokesman for Taxpayers for Common Sense, an
advocacy group that supports cutting corporate subsidies, worries
about the effect of such donations.
</P>
<P>
   ''It is no secret that money that goes to grease the wheels of
these political conventions makes it difficult to stop the
corporate welfare machine,'' Ashdown said.
</P>
<P>
   But another opponent of the subsidies disagrees, saying
constituent concerns often drive lawmakers' interests more than
political money.
</P>
<P>
   ''Members don't look past the fact that a corporation might have
employees in their district, might have subcontractors in their
district,'' said Rep. Joseph Hoeffel, D-Pa. ''One man's corporate
welfare is another man's desperately needed government program.''

<HEADLINE> Moderate Serbs Make Concessions  </HEADLINE>
By ROBERT H. REID
<TEXT>
<P>
   PRISTINA, Yugoslavia (AP) -- In a widening split over Kosovo's
first internationally supervised elections, moderate Serbs say they
are willing to participate if some conditions are met, while their
hardline counterparts insist on a boycott.
</P>
<P>
   Saturday had been the deadline for Kosovars of all groups --
Albanian, Serb, Turkish, Gypsies and others -- to register for
municipal elections in October. However, U.N. administrator Bernard
Kouchner extended the deadline until the close of business
Wednesday after international officials said they had seen the
first clear signs that some Kosovo Serbs wanted to take part.
</P>
<P>
   ''It was decided to give them time to see whether those
indications produce something tangible,'' said Roland Bless,
spokesman for the Organization for Security and Cooperation in
Europe which will supervise the balloting.
</P>
<P>
   U.N. sources, speaking on condition of anonymity, said the Serb
community in the small town of Leposavic was interested in
registering.
</P>
<P>
   And in Gracanica, just south of Pristina, a group representing
the province's moderate Serb faction said late Friday that they
would not boycott the vote in areas ''where there is a minimum of
conditions that municipal authorities actually function.''
</P>
<P>
   Backing of elections by the moderates is conditional on U.N.
agreement that no voting take place in areas where a fair ballot is
impossible because of a ''lack of human rights,'' said a statement
carried by the Beta news agency
</P>
<P>
   However, Serb leaders in the largest Serb enclave, Kosovska
Mitrovica, remained adamantly opposed. The Serb leader there,
Oliver Ivanovic, wants the United Nations to return 1,500 Serbs
within one week from Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Thousands of Serbs fled the province after Yugoslav troops
withdrew in June 1999 following the 78-day NATO bombing campaign.
</P>
<P>
   Ivanovic has also insisted that the United Nations provide a
concrete timetable for organizing the return of another 210,000
non-Albanians who fled Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   However, U.N. officials have been resisting the demand. The
outgoing Kosovo chief of the U.N. refugee agency, Dennis McNamara,
said a premature return of Serbs would only worsen the already
tense ethnic climate in the province.
</P>
<P>
   After the U.N. announcement Friday, the official Yugoslav news
agency Tanjug quoted the hardline Serb National Council as ruling
out any possibility of Serbs taking part in registration and
elections until Serbs who fled last year can return.
</P>
<P>
   ''The Serbs from this region will not register nor take part in
the vote until Serbs start returning to Kosovo in bigger numbers,''
said Dragisa Milovic, spokesman for Ivanovic.
</P>
<P>
   ''If the international community succeeds in organizing the
return of the Serbs, guaranteeing their safety, we will change our
minds,'' Milovic added. ''For now, we have absolutely no security
in Kosovo, nor are we able to move around. Under those conditions,
any election would be absurd.''
</P>
<P>
   Some leaders of the 15,000-strong Turkish minority were also
boycotting to press demands that the Turkish language be considered
equal under the law with Albanian and Serbian province-wide. Only
about 1,000 ethnic Turks had registered by late Friday, the OSCE
said.
</P>
<P>
   Without significant minority participation, the U.N. idea of
elections as a basis of creating a democratic multiethnic community
would be compromised.
</P>
<P>
   Ethnic Albanians are believed to comprise more than 90 percent
of Kosovo's estimated 2 million people, although no reliable census
has been taken in decades.
</P>
<P>
   Russia's ambassador to the United Nations, Sergey Lavrov, has
challenged the decision to proceed with the October election
without major Serb participation. Lavrov told the U.N. Security
Council on Thursday that lack of participation by the Serbs ''would
distort both the ethnic and the political picture in Kosovo.''
</P>
<P>
   U.N. Assistant Secretary-General Hedi Annabi told the Council
that virtually all the registration applications -- which the United
Nations here said has reached 1 million -- were from ethnic
Albanians.
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, U.N. spokeswoman Susan Manuel said in Pristina
that the Russian objections were ''not going to influence our plans
for holding elections in October. We will have elections in
October.''

<HEADLINE> Group: China Farmers, Police Clash  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   BEIJING (AP) -- Farmers worried that the government planned to
block access to a reservoir fought with police in drought-stricken
eastern China in a clash that left an officer dead and 140 people
injured, a rights group reported Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   The confrontation July 6 highlights an increasingly dire
shortage of water in northern China. Drought this year has already
destroyed 35 million acres of crops and left 16.2 million people
short of water, nearly a fifth of them in eastern Shandong
province.
</P>
<P>
   Officials concerned about protecting the Mushan reservoir, one
of Shandong's largest, decided in recent weeks to start a project
to prevent seepage, the Hong Kong-based Information Center of Human
Rights and Democracy reported.
</P>
<P>
   That alarmed farmers who had long relied on the seepage to
irrigate their fields, and 5,000 farmers blocked construction of
the project July 6, the center said.
</P>
<P>
   They fought with 300 police sent to disperse them, and 100
farmers and 40 officers were wounded, the center said. It added
that one officer was beaten to death.
</P>
<P>
   Officials with the Mushan reservoir management bureau and the
nearby Anqiu city government confirmed that a clash happened, but
either contradicted or refused to comment on details of the
Information Center account.
</P>
<P>
   One official with the Anqiu propaganda department, who spoke on
condition of anonymity, said the farmers tried to break into the
reservoir management bureau, fighting with its officials, not
police.
</P>
<P>
   Rapid development in the countryside has caused frequent
disputes between farmers and officials over land-use rights, with
some resulting in protests. The Information Center said nationwide
China had 100,000 protests last year, up from 60,000 in 1998. All
but a few go unreported by state-controlled media.

<HEADLINE> Castro Meets Elian for First Time  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   HAVANA (AP) -- Cuban President Fidel Castro has finally met the
6-year-old boy who was the focus of his politics for much of the
past seven months, official media reports said Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   Castro visited Elian Gonzalez's family Friday to congratulate
the child for completing first grade, according to Granma, the
Communist Party daily.
</P>
<P>
   The reports did not say where the meeting took place, but the
government had prepared a house in west Havana for Elian, his
father Juan Miguel and their family following the child's return
from the United States.
</P>
<P>
   ''Comrade Fidel visited Juan Miguel and his family and was able
to meet and greet Elian,'' said Radio Reloj. It said Castro gave
Elian a copy of ''The Golden Age,'' a children's book by Cuban
independence hero Jose Marti.
</P>
<P>
   Castro wrote a dedication in the book: ''For when you are in the
fourth or fifth grade and can enjoy one of the most tender works of
Marti.''
</P>
<P>
   It was the first reported meeting between the Cuban leader and
Elian since the child returned from the United States on June 28.
Castro had pledged that Cuba would avoid making the center of a
media circus on his return to the island.
</P>
<P>
   State television reported Friday night that Elian had received
his first-grade diploma after a special effort by teachers to help
him recover the time lost during his tumultuous stay in the United
States.
</P>
<P>
   Elian survived a boat sinking that killed his mother and 10
other would-be emigres trying to reach Florida.
</P>
<P>
   After the child was rescued Nov. 25, a dispute over custody
between relatives in the United States and his father in Cuba
became a major international incident involving Castro and top U.S.
officials.

<P>
	   ROCHESTER, N.Y. (AP) - One of two 18-year-olds charged with
robbing and shooting to death two teen-agers has been indicted on
first-degree murder charges, which carry a possible death penalty.
</P>
<P>
   Benjamin Switzer, 18, was indicted on capital charges Friday in
the slayings of William Barnwell, 18, and Eric Jenkins, 19. The

they were shot at close range near their homes on April 28.
</P>
<P>
   Switzer will be arraigned July 24 along with fellow suspect
Rommel Lewis, 18, who was charged with second-degree murder. They
were jailed without bail. Prosecutors must decide by Oct. 21
whether to seek the death penalty for Switzer.
</P>
<P>
   The victims were robbed of money and drugs but police said the
killings were not drug-related.

<HEADLINE> Tobacco tax hike a ''disaster'' to cigarette vendors  </HEADLINE>
By JOEL STASHENKO
<TEXT>
<P>
   ALBANY, N.Y. (AP) - The near doubling of New York's cigarette
tax to a highest-in-the-nation $1.11 a pack has been a ''disaster''
for small retailers, the state Association of Convenience Stores
says.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, tobacco taxes were being paid to the state at a
rate about 25 percent lower for the first four months the new tax
was in effect than in the same period last year.
</P>
<P>
   Stores are reporting drop-offs in cigarette sales of between 30
percent and 60 percent since March 1 when the state added 55 cents
a pack onto the old 56-cent-a-pack cigarette tax, according to Jim
Calvin, executive director of the Albany-based convenience stores
association.
</P>
<P>
   Since cigarettes are typically the stores' single biggest
sellers, accounting for a quarter to a third of income, the slump
in tobacco sales is pinching vendors, Calvin said.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's hurting them, without a doubt,'' agreed Mark Alesse, head
of the state chapter of the National Federation of Independent
Business. ''They are seeing sales drop off, particularly stores
near Indian reservations. They're getting killed and they don't
know what to do about it.''
</P>
<P>
   Indian vendors do not charge sales tax on cigarettes, so they
can offer cartons to customers for as much as $13.50 less than
non-Indian retailers.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to non-Indian vendors in western and central New
York, Calvin said New York retailers close to the state's 340-mile
border with Pennsylvania are also suffering. Cigarette taxes in
that state are only 31 cents a pack, meaning New York smokers can
save $8 a carton by venturing into Pennsylvania.
</P>
<P>
   Calvin said he doubts that anything like a quarter to a third of
the smokers in New York have quit because of the tax price hike.
</P>
<P>
   ''If it were a case of people gradually quitting smoking, I
think our industry could adapt to that,'' he said. ''But the loss
of business has occurred overnight and you will never convince me
that that many people quit smoking that fast all at once.''
</P>
<P>
   The cigarette tax increase was approved by the Legislature and
Gov. George Pataki in December. Part of the revenue from the
increased tax is earmarked for a state health insurance program for
the working poor.
</P>
<P>
   Anti-tobacco advocates predicted that the ''sticker shock'' on
tobacco prices produced by the tax increase would also cause some
people to quit smoking.
</P>
<P>
   Revenues to the state under the higher tobacco tax rate were up
- $303.8 million from March through June of this year vs. $209.6
million for the similar period last year.
</P>
<P>
   But that takes into an account the near doubling of the tax. Had
the rate of payments remained steady under the higher tax, the
state would have collected roughly $400 million during that same
period instead of the $303.8 million it did take in.
</P>
<P>
   Under another comparison, the state is continuing to bank the
''old'' portion of the tobacco tax, the 56-cent-a-pack charge, and
is channeling the ''new'' add-on to pay for health programs.
According to state Comptroller H. Carl McCall's office, the 56-cent
portion of the tax totaled $154.6 million for March through June of
this year, or nearly $57.5 million less than the tax of the same
amount accounted for during March through June of 1999.
</P>
<P>
   Andrea Baker, who manages seven Taylor's Mini Mart stores in the
Cooperstown area, said cigarette sales in her stores are down about
30 percent since the new tax took effect. That does not count the
loss of other business that customers who smoke tend to bring to
the stores, she said.
</P>
<P>
   Typical nonsmokers will spend about $1.25 per visit to one of
her stores, according to Baker. Smokers, who are often daily
customers, will spend on average more than $5.
</P>
<P>
   Robert Newman, whose company operates 50 Noco Express and
Express Shop stores in the Buffalo area, said his shops' cigarette
sales are down 32 percent since March 1.
</P>
<P>
   ''He (Pataki) thinks he is preventing smoking by doing this, but
what he is doing is driving smokers to the reservations. ... What
he has done is create a smoker's paradise on the reservations and
subsequently is costing tax revenues to the state.''
</P>
<P>
   Calvin said tobacco retail industry officials warned state
leaders that a dramatic increase in the cigarette tax would not
have the intended effects.
</P>
<P>
   ''It has been a disaster,'' he said. ''It has backfired. It is
neither dissuading people from smoking nor generating the revenues
it was intended to generate to fund health care programs. But it
has most certainly severely impacted the convenience store industry
- which is comprised mainly of mom-and-pop operations.''

<HEADLINE> Pataki rakes in almost $2.35 million in first half of year  </HEADLINE>
By MARC HUMBERT
<TEXT>
<P>
   ALBANY, N.Y. (AP) - Gov. George Pataki collected almost $2.35
million during the first six months of this year to prepare for a
possible bid for a third term in 2002, aides reported Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   The show of fund-raising muscle is opportune for Pataki. The New
York Republican is considered a possible running mate for George W.
Bush in the Texas governor's presidential bid.
</P>
<P>
   Four years ago, as Pataki geared up for his successful bid for a
second, four-year term as governor, his campaign committee
collected $1.66 million during the first six months of that year.
</P>
<P>
   On Friday, state Comptroller H. Carl McCall, a Democrat
considering a run for governor in 2002, reported raising more than
$1.1 million in the first six months of this year. McCall, in a
report prepared for filing with the state Board of Elections, said
that after expenses, he still had more than $1.05 million in the
bank.
</P>
<P>
   Pataki, after spending almost $667,000 during the first six
months of this year, still has $3.97 million in his campaign
account, according to his report.
</P>
<P>
   ''This clearly shows an enormous amount of support for Governor
Pataki's policies and for his record of achievement in this
state,'' said Pataki spokeswoman Zenia Mucha.
</P>
<P>
   Mucha, one of the governor's top political advisers, said
Pataki's campaign used direct-mail appeals heavily in the latest
fund-raising period and managed to generate about 4,000 new
contributors as a result.
</P>
<P>
   The Pataki aide said the money could not be legally used for a
vice presidential campaign.
</P>
<P>
   Even so, Pataki has routinely demonstrated an ability to put
together large campaign bankrolls quickly and his latest success
comes at a time when Bush and Vice President Al Gore are mining New
York heavily for campaign cash, as are U.S. Senate candidates
Hillary Rodham Clinton and Republican Rep. Rick Lazio. Lazio's GOP
predecessor in the Senate race, Mayor Rudolph Giuliani, had
collected almost $20 million through the end of March. The New York
City mayor left the race in mid-May in the face of prostate cancer
and marital problems.
</P>
<P>
   McCall has told supporters in private meetings that he will run
for governor, but for public consumption he has said only that he
would like to run. McCall has promised an announcement about his
plans soon after this November's election for president and U.S.
Senate.
</P>
<P>
   Besides McCall, federal Housing Secretary Andrew Cuomo, the
eldest son of former Gov. Mario Cuomo, is considering a run for the
Democratic nomination for governor. The younger Cuomo has not yet
begun fund raising.
</P>
<P>
   Running for governor in New York state has become an expensive
proposition. In 1998, Pataki spent more than $20 million to win a
second term. At this point four years ago, Pataki reported almost
$2.85 million in the bank.
</P>
<P>
   Over the last six months of last year, Pataki reported raising
more than $824,000 and started this year with $2.32 million.

By JIM HEINTZ
<TEXT>
<P>
   MOSCOW (AP) -- Russia's economy may be overshadowed by those of
the seven richest industrial nations, but President Vladimir Putin
aims to keep Russia in the spotlight at next week's Group of Eight
summit.
</P>
<P>
   By making high-profile stops in China and North Korea en route
to the summit, Putin will try to bolster Russia's image as a world
power, then follow up by using the summit to push Russia's global
concerns.
</P>
<P>
   Russia began its connection with the Group of Seven major
industrial democracies -- the United States, Canada, Britain,
Germany, France, Italy and Japan -- in 1997. President Clinton
invited then-President Boris Yeltsin to attend a G-7 summit that
year as an inducement for Russia to back off from objections to
NATO expansion.
</P>
<P>
   The invitation was attractive to the country that once cherished
its superpower status, but then watched it decay with the collapse
of the Soviet Union.
</P>
<P>
   But because the Group of Seven still holds separate economic
meetings, Russia appears marginalized. Summits such as the one
beginning July 21 in Okinawa, Japan, are often seen as meetings of
the Group of Seven-Plus-One instead of eight equal partners.
</P>
<P>
   ''Russia will always be a poor relative,'' analyst Yevgeny Volk
of the Heritage Foundation's Moscow office said. He added that
being invited to the summit isn't a recognition of Russian power,
''it's more of a courtesy.''
</P>
<P>
   Putin this week noted that Russia's early work with the G-7 was
focused on securing loans. That time has passed, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ''Today, we abandon this format of communication,'' he declared.
He said he intends to use the summit to put forth Russia's views on
global issues, and Russian officials say security matters will be
high on the list.
</P>
<P>
   Russia is concerned about terrorism brewing along its long and
porous Asian border. It also sees the U.S. proposal to build a
national missile-defense system as a significant security threat.
</P>
<P>
   Those issues will come together in Putin's visit July 19-20 to
North Korea, the first by a Russian leader to the isolated
Stalinist state. The United States cites North Korea as one of the
''rogue states'' whose suspected development of nuclear weapons
makes the missile-defense system necessary.
</P>
<P>
   It is not clear whether Putin intends to raise the nuclear issue
during his Pyongyang visit, but the ITAR-Tass news agency quoted
Deputy Foreign Minister Alexander Losyukov as saying that
military-technical cooperation could be discussed. Moscow could use
military aid to induce North Korea to back off on the nuclear
weapons issue.
</P>
<P>
   In light of North Korea's recent signs that it is tentatively
opening itself to the rest of the world, some commentators see
Putin's trip as an important demonstration of Russian diplomacy.
Moscow has already made it clear it wants to be a mediator between
North and South Korea, alongside Washington and Beijing, and now
Putin will be playing the role of intermediary between Pyongyang
and the West.
</P>
<P>
   ''Putin, with his visit to Pyongyang, is appearing at the
necessary time in the necessary place,'' commentator Dmitry Kosirev
wrote in the newspaper Nezavisimaya Gazeta.
</P>
<P>
   The Pyongyang visit will come on the heels of another stop that
is to sure to keep Putin's visibility high: Beijing. Tuesday's
summit will be Putin's first visit to China since he became
president.
</P>
<P>
   Russian Foreign Minister Igor Ivanov and Chinese Foreign
Minister Tang Jiaxuan crafted a statement Saturday to be signed by
their presidents that condemns the proposed U.S. missile defense
system, Russian Embassy spokesman Vladimir Zakharov said in
Beijing.
</P>
<P>
   But perhaps more significantly, Putin and Chinese President
Jiang Zemin want to continue the close relations that have allowed
the former communist rivals to work against what they see as U.S.
global dominance.
</P>
<P>
   ''I believe that the positions of such two great powers as
Russia and China, which are U.N. Security Council members and
possess nuclear weapons, should be taken into account by any
state,'' Itar-Tass quoted Ivanov as saying Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   At the G-8 summit, Putin says, he will raise not only
international security issues, but push for further disarmament
measures and discuss environmental issues.
</P>
<P>
   But many observers question how much influence Russia can wield,
given its troubled economy and its immense debts to foreign
governments.
</P>
<P>
   Mikhail Delyagin, head of the Institute of Globalization
Problems, noted that Russia's share of the world economy is 0.6
percent, ''exactly 100 times less than that of the G-7.''
</P>
<P>
   ''It is natural given such indicators that a question arises:
'How is it possible to take part in discussions as an equal?'''

<HEADLINE> Hartford mayor wants chief to resign after evidence scandal  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	   HARTFORD, Conn. (AP) - Mayor Mike Peters is calling for the
resignation of acting Police Chief Deborah Barrows amid revelations
her department has failed to comply with court orders to destroy
evidence seized during arrests.
</P>
<P>
   ''She's not doing the job,'' Peters said, suggesting the city
may have to go outside the department for a leader until a
permanent chief is found. ''We cannot go on like this.''
</P>
<P>
   There were conflicting reports about whether Barrows, who was
named acting chief when now-retired Chief Joseph Croughwell went on
medical leave 14 months ago, had agreed to step down. WVIT-TV
reported that she cleared her police office of personal belongings
Friday night.
</P>
<P>
   Barrows told The Hartford Courant Friday night that she had no
intention of leaving.
</P>
<P>
   ''This is a great city. I love living here and I'll continue to
do my job,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   City Manager Saundra Kee Borges, the person with the power to
remove Barrows, said she shared the mayor's frustration. She
planned to meet with Barrows on Monday.
</P>
<P>
   The department came under fire a week ago when two state
agencies demanded hundreds of thousands of dollars they have been
owed them for more than a year.
</P>
<P>
   Money and property used as evidence is stored at the Hartford
Police Department's property room until the conclusion of a
criminal case. This year, Superior Court judges ordered the
department more than 700 times to destroy evidence, return personal
property to its rightful owners, or hand over property such as cash
or guns to other state agencies, court records show.
</P>
<P>
   Seventy percent of these orders - including 80 percent of the
destruction orders -have not yet been obeyed, according to court
records.
</P>
<P>
   Wednesday Barrows issued a statement saying her department had
destroyed narcotics in nearly 4,000 cases since mid-1999. She also
said the department had handed over 601 guns since March 1999.
</P>
<P>
   But that statement came just hours after the department handed
over 217 guns to the state police on Wednesday, by far the largest
single drop in two years.
</P>
<P>
   ''It seems that it goes from one extreme to another,'' said
Hartford Councilman Steven Harris, chairman of the council's public
safety committee. ''But now they are responding.''
</P>
<P>
   The scandal surfaced when Chief State's Attorney John M. Bailey
reported that the department failed to share $380,000 intended for
its forfeiture account since April 1999. Twenty percent was
supposed to go to the state Department of Mental Health and
Addiction Services; 10 percent was to pay for salaries in Bailey's
office. The complaint was on the heels of demands by court
officials for the department to comply with their orders.
</P>
<P>
   On Wednesday and Thursday, the department turned over $118,601
to the state's attorney and about $4,500 to the Superior Court,
records show.
</P>
<P>
   A city audit of the property room, which started Wednesday, is
expected to be complete by Tuesday, Deputy City Manager James
Wright said.

<HEADLINE> Barak, Arafat Intertwine Destinies  </HEADLINE>
By LAURA KING
<TEXT>
<P>
   THURMONT, Md. (AP) -- The destinies of Israeli Prime Minister
Ehud Barak and Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat were intertwined
long before the two ever met and decades before they sat across the
bargaining table from one another.
</P>
<P>
   Arafat was the PLO chieftain whose fighters hijacked planes and
staged terror attacks for the Palestinian cause. The young Barak
made his name as a member of an elite Israeli commando unit that
targeted those same Palestinian guerrillas for assassination.
</P>
<P>
   Barak, 58, and Arafat, 70, are nearly a generation apart in age.
But both spent most of their adult lives as military men before
becoming politicians, and each retains the tactical skills that he
drew on in decades of sometimes shadowy combat.
</P>
<P>
   Barak and Arafat are products of cultures in which battlefield
experience is the most crucial credential for a leader who seeks to
make peace.
</P>
<P>
   As Israel and the Palestinians took their first steps toward
peace in the late 1980s, Arafat was among the first important
Palestinian figures to decide that the guerrilla warfare he had led
for decades might not be the best way to achieve statehood.
</P>
<P>
   Only someone like Arafat, revered as the symbol of the
Palestinian armed struggle, had the clout and credibility to turn
his back on violence and try to achieve peace through negotiations.
</P>
<P>
   Even so, he still clings to martial trappings, wearing
military-style fatigues and sometimes strapping a pistol to his hip
when at home in the West Bank or Gaza Strip. A week ago, he chose a
military event, with Palestinian troops marching in formation, as
his departure ceremony to the Camp David talks.
</P>
<P>
   Barak, who was Israel's most decorated soldier, often talks like
the army chief of staff he was -- a man who does not have to explain
himself to his subordinates -- when putting forth his peace plans.
</P>
<P>
   When he unilaterally pulled Israeli troops out of south Lebanon
in May, ending a two-decade-long military presence and fulfilling a
key campaign pledge, Barak brushed aside security fears raised by
some.
</P>
<P>
   Answering critics, he said he knew best how to defend Israel. He
said essentially the same thing as he left last week for the peace
talks.
</P>
<P>
   For all their differences, Barak and Arafat often have been
political allies, sometimes tacitly, sometimes openly.
</P>
<P>
   When Barak was running for prime minister on a peace platform,
Arafat did him a huge political favor by letting pass without any
action a May 1999 deadline for a statehood declaration.
</P>
<P>
   A unilateral Palestinian declaration of independence at that
time would boosted the prospects of Barak's hard-line opponent,
Benjamin Netanyahu.
</P>
<P>
   The chemistry between Barak and Arafat is difficult to read
these days. Pictures of the two of them engaging in a bit of
horseplay as the Camp David summit began -- mock-wrestling as they
tried to usher each other first through a doorway -- were flashed
around the world.
</P>
<P>
   But in five days of talks, only a single face-to-face meeting
between the two had been disclosed by Saturday, although they twice
had gotten together in the company of President Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   Arafat warmly welcomed Barak's election, and initial meetings
between them were friendly. Arafat, however, was angered when Barak
virtually abandoned peacemaking with the Palestinians for several
months to turn his attention to Syria, perhaps Israel's most bitter
enemy. Israeli-Syrian talks resumed only briefly before breaking
down again.
</P>
<P>
   The negotiations may showcase a few similarities in Barak and
Arafat's personal styles. Both are detail men who sometimes make
life extremely difficult for their staffs with their reluctance to
delegate responsibility.
</P>
<P>
   Barak -- leader of the world's most highly militarized democracy
-- serves as Israel's defense minister in addition to being prime
minister, unwilling to relinquish key portfolio.
</P>
<P>
   Arafat, too, is known as an autocratic leader. He never has
allowed any associates to build a base of popular support, even
though his failure to groom a successor could spark disruption and
uncertainty in the event he dies or becomes incapacitated.
</P>
<P>
   Both Barak and Arafat sometimes have come to grief when they too
easily dismiss their internal political foes.
</P>
<P>
   Like his military and political mentor, the slain Prime Minister
Yitzhak Rabin, Barak has never been good at consensus-building.
That weakness was apparent when his governing coalition crumbled on
the eve of his departure for the talks.
</P>
<P>
   Arafat could get the same kind of unpleasant surprise from
Hamas, the radical Islamic group that has tried repeatedly to
sabotage the peace process with suicide bombings.

<HEADLINE> Fox's Future Seen in Past  </HEADLINE>
By MEGAN LARDNER
<TEXT>
<P>
   SILAO, Mexico (AP) -- Amid the strawberry fields and grazing
cattle, a sparkling industrial building rises from the side of the
highway. Inside, 500 employees in crisp uniform dress shirts
assemble electronic parts for General Motors cars. The American
flag flaps outside.
</P>
<P>
   More than anything else, plants like American Axle are the
crowning achievement of Vicente Fox's term as governor of
Guanajuato. Now that he has been elected president, they offer a
hint of the future he envisions for Mexico.
</P>
<P>
   Eduardo Acosto, a 22-year-old assembly-line worker at American
Axle, likes that Mexico just fine. He has worked here since the
plant opened a year ago, drawn by Fox's aggressive courting of
foreign business investment.
</P>
<P>
   ''This is the best there is,'' Acosto said during a break from
his 12-hour weekday shift. ''All the work here provides people with
a living and more opportunities to learn technical skills.''
</P>
<P>
   But not all 4.6 million inhabitants of Guanajuato state are so
enthusiastic. Critics -- and there are many -- say Fox's economic
expansion programs may have been flashy, but came at the expense of
social services like health care and education.
</P>
<P>
   ''Foreign investment and economic growth have been the greatest
successes of Vicente Fox's government,'' said Emeterio Guevara, a
political analyst at the University of Guanajuato. ''But the
benefits have not always been equally distributed.''
</P>
<P>
   Since 1995, when Fox became governor of the rural, central state
of Guanajuato, foreign investment and exports have boomed. Between
1995 and 1999, the state's gross domestic product grew 21 percent.
Exports shot up from $1.6 billion in 1995 to $4.2 billion in 1998.
</P>
<P>
   Foreign companies arrived in droves. Total investment in the
state was more than $2.1 billion between 1995 and 1999, creating
nearly 50,000 new jobs. In 1999, the state's unemployment rate was
half the national average.
</P>
<P>
   ''Our goal is to double the economy and the number of jobs this
coming year,'' said Manuel Ayala, international investment adviser
for the state Secretariat of Economic Development. ''And we hope
president Fox will help us out.''
</P>
<P>
   Since Fox initiated a state technical university system in 1996,
some 8,000 students have graduated with marketable skills.
</P>
<P>
   But in 1998, the latest year for which figures are available,
illiteracy rates were still the ninth-highest in the country and
school attendance for children between ages 6 and 14 ranked 24th
among the 32 states.
</P>
<P>
   Malu Micher, a state legislator from the opposition Democratic
Revolution Party, said wages have remained low in Guanajuato even
as the economy grew. Micher said the low unemployment rate is
deceiving, because seasonal agricultural workers and people who are
underemployed are not included.
</P>
<P>
   ''Guanajuato has about 1.4 million male immigrants in the United
States,'' she said. ''That's why there's work here.''
</P>
<P>
   While the northern and southern parts of Guanajuato remain
marginalized, the state's central zone, known as the ''Industrial
Corridor,'' is expanding fast. Dozens of foreign companies have set
up shop here in the last few years -- 30 related to General Motors
alone. A Holiday Inn Express was inaugurated July 8.
</P>
<P>
   Juan Carlos Velazquez, a former General Motors engineer who now
runs an Internet company, attributes his success to the booming
economy and small-business loans Fox made possible.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's a different world from 10 years ago,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Others would like to go back to the old world.
</P>
<P>
   In the agricultural region of Irapuato, a leader in strawberry
exports, Mexican workers have been involved in a bitter yearlong
legal battle over wages with a U.S.-owned fruit company.
</P>
<P>
   In the state's largest city, Leon, famous for its leather shoes,
manufacturers say competition from new Chinese-owned factories have
caused local sales to fall 40 percent over the past few months.
</P>
<P>
   Guanajuato's daily newspaper Correo called Fox, a former
Coca-Cola executive, a ''cellular governor'', out of touch with
state businesses as he traveled to the United States, Asia and
Europe to court foreign investors.
</P>
<P>
   Historian Arturo Miranda went even further: ''As president, he
will run the country as a business, and sell it all.''
</P>
<P>
   And for many listening to Fox's speeches since his election July
2, he already appears to be in business mode -- starting with his
explanation of how he will form his cabinet.
</P>
<P>
   ''We will be using the best headhunting firms,'' Miranda said.
''This team will consult its clients -- clients being the people it
is supposed to serve.''
</P>
<P>
   Fox said that as president, he will focus on the economy,
education, job creation, and crime. He has scheduled a meeting with
President Clinton, and says Mexico must demand an equal position in
the economic arena.
</P>
<P>
   Those in Guanajuato know much is riding on Fox's presidency.
''The National Action Party has everything to prove to the world,''
said Tomas Lopez, the party's director in Leon.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Fox's successor, governor-elect Juan Carlos Romero,
who is from Fox's party, plans to continue Fox's economic policies
in Guanajuato.
</P>
<P>
   ''Globalization is here to stay,'' he said.

<HEADLINE> PRI Struggles With Opposition Area  </HEADLINE>
By MEGAN LARDNER
<TEXT>
<P>
   LEON, Mexico (AP) -- In the bustling city center, on the steps of
a cement-block building nearly hidden by taco stands and T-shirt
shops, seven members of the Institutional Revolutionary Party sit
silent and expressionless.
</P>
<P>
   On the wall, the painted image of President Ernesto Zedillo
grins, but no one smiles back. Surrounded on all sides by a city in
celebration after the historic victory of opposition presidential
candidate Vicente Fox, the drab PRI headquarters in Leon is a
lonely island.
</P>
<P>
   A city of 1 million people near the ranch where Fox grew up,
Leon is a stronghold of Fox's National Action Party, or PAN. It has
had a PAN mayor since 1988, and a PAN governor since 1991. When Fox
takes office on Dec. 1, Leon will have a PAN president too,
completing the humiliation of the party that has ruled Mexico since
1929.
</P>
<P>
   PRI leaders here, more than anywhere else in Mexico, are getting
used to being in the opposition. Martin Ortiz says the most
important goal is not to lose the little presence the PRI maintains
in Leon. And he says if his party doesn't reorganize fast on the
national level, the PAN will become entirely dominant.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's important that what is happening in Leon doesn't occur on
a national level,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   Fox's support in Leon is overwhelming. His name appears on
stickers, billboards, car windshields and on the Fox boots
manufactured nearby. He held his last campaign rally here, setting
off an all-night party of honking horns and revelers in the
streets.
</P>
<P>
   On July 2, voters here elected a new PAN governor -- and Fox.
Fox's rival, PRI candidate Francisco Labastida, got only 20 percent
of the vote in Leon.
</P>
<P>
   At PRI headquarters, dejection hangs in the air.
</P>
<P>
   ''He sold us out,'' says Vicente Flores, scowling at Zedillo's
image. He is angry that Zedillo recognized Fox's victory even
before the official results were announced.
</P>
<P>
   But Ortiz remains hopeful that one day the PRI will be strong
again.
</P>
<P>
   ''We aren't going to keep crying about the past,'' he says.

<HEADLINE> Doctor facing death penalty in patient killings  </HEADLINE>
By LARRY McSHANE
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) - At first glance, Dr. Michael Swango was
everything a patient could want in a physician: confident and
competent, with a good bedside manner.
</P>
<P>
   Prosecutors took a longer look and saw something else: they
charged the disgraced ex-doctor with fatally poisoning three
patients at a Long Island veterans hospital, part of a trail of
dead bodies going back 16 years and stretching from Ohio to
Zimbabwe.
</P>
<P>
   ''Everything he did was designed to draw people in and make them
trust him,'' said U.S. Attorney Loretta Lynch, who announced
Swango's murder indictment. Now the man dubbed ''Dr. Death'' in a
tabloid headline faces the death penalty himself.
</P>
<P>
   Swango returns Monday to Long Island for his arraignment on the
murder charges.
</P>
<P>
   While authorities have only charged Swango with three murders,
the best-selling book ''Blind Eye: The Story of a Doctor who Got
Away with Murder'' suggested the death count could hit 35 patients
on two continents.
</P>
<P>
   ''He's a charming, pathological liar,'' acknowledged Dr. Jordan
Cohen, dean of the Long Island medical school that ran the facility
where the alleged Swango slayings occurred.
</P>
<P>
   Swango's lies continued right up until 1997, when he was
arrested while boarding a plane for Saudi Arabia and another
medical job, authorities said.
</P>
<P>
   On Tuesday, the 45-year-old Swango - just days from release at a
Colorado prison on unrelated charges - was accused of the 1993
murders of three patients at the Veterans Administration Hospital
in Northport.
</P>
<P>
   Swango allegedly injected the three with toxins. In two of the
cases, he then told other hospital staff that the patients'
families had issued ''do not resuscitate'' orders, the indictment
said.
</P>
<P>
   ''At first, he was a nice doctor,'' recalled Barron Harris Jr.,
whose father survived an alleged Swango attack on Long Island. ''I
remember shaking his hand - he said he would do the best he
could.''
</P>
<P>
   After the indictment last Tuesday, Swango's court-appointed
lawyer, Randi Chavis, did not return a call seeking comment.
Efforts to reach the lawyer later in the week also proved
unsuccessful.
</P>
<P>
   Swango's ''career'' began soon after his 1983 graduation from
the Southern Illinois University Medical School. There, according
to James B. Stewart's ''Blind Eye,'' the medical student was dubbed
''Double-0 Swango'' by classmates who joked that he had a license
to kill after several of his cases ended in death.
</P>
<P>
   While an intern at Ohio State University Hospital in 1984,
Swango allegedly killed a 19-year-old gymnast with a fatal dose of
potassium, according to the New York indictment.
</P>
<P>
   Swango was never prosecuted for that crime, or for another
alleged poisoning of an OSU patient who survived.
</P>
<P>
   But Swango had another victim in Ohio: a teen driving the car
that initially injured the gymnast was convicted of reckless
homicide after her death. The youth spent 2&AMP;frac12; years on probation and
wound up with a record for a crime allegedly committed by Swango.
</P>
<P>
   Swango was not permitted to return for year two of his OSU
residency; he instead returned to his Quincy, Ill., home and took a
job as an emergency medical technician.
</P>
<P>
   His stint ended with his conviction for lacing his co-workers'
coffee and doughnuts with ant poison. Five of them became ill, and
Swango did two years of a five-year sentence behind bars.
</P>
<P>
   He also lost his medical license, which Swango apparently
considered a mere formality. His prison release coincided with
various unsuccessful attempts to revive his career, and he
eventually landed a 1993 residency at the State University of New
York at Stony Brook.
</P>
<P>
   Three Long Island patients - Thomas Sammarco, 73; George Siano,
60; and disabled Korean War veteran Aldo Serini - died between July
and October 1993 while staying at the veterans' hospital run by the
school.
</P>
<P>
   Swango was cut loose by SUNY-Stony Brook after his past record
became public knowledge, and he soon relocated to Zimbabwe. Within
a year of his arrival, patients in a hospital there were showing
signs of poisoning, the indictment said.
</P>
<P>
   In July 1995, a Zimbabwe hospital suspended Swango from
practice. He was finally arrested two years later at O'Hare Airport
in Chicago, where he was boarding a flight to Saudi Arabia for a
new medical job.
</P>
<P>
   The Chicago arrest was for lying about his criminal record on
his SUNY application. Prosecutors had, in part, brought those
charges to buy time in building a murder case.

	   NEW YORK (AP) - A worker at a Brooklyn fast-food restaurant was
killed by a shotgun blast early Saturday during a botched robbery
attempt, police said.
</P>
<P>
   Mahbub Rahman, 27, of Brooklyn, was killed at about 1:30 a.m.
during the holdup inside Ala King Fried Chicken and Pizza on
Broadway in the Bushwick section, said police spokesman Alan
Krawitz.
</P>
<P>
   An unidentified bandit fired a shotgun at Rahman during the
robbery try, but the killer apparently fled without any cash,
Krawitz said. No arrests were made, and the investigation into the
homicide continued Saturday, he said.

<HEADLINE> U.S.: Iran Test Raises Concerns  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Iran's reported test-firing of a medium-range
missile underscores long-standing concerns about the risk of
weapons proliferation in the Persian Gulf region, U.S. officials
said Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   Tehran television reported that Iran on Saturday fired the
Shahab-3 missile, which is capable of reaching Israel or U.S.
troops in Saudi Arabia.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. officials said Iran's effort to boost its missile
capabilities poses a serious threat to the area and undermines
nonproliferation efforts.
</P>
<P>
   ''If we were ever to achieve an official dialogue with Iran,
this is certainly a subject we would want to discuss,'' said P.J.
Crowley, a spokesman for the National Security Council.
</P>
<P>
   ''They (the Iranians) understand that in a dialogue we would
want to engage them on a number of issues, including the Middle
East peace process, their support of terrorism and their
development of weapons of mass destruction and the means to deliver
them,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The Clinton administration has said missile threats from
countries such as Iran and North Korea were behind development of a
proposed national anti-missile defense system.
</P>
<P>
   Crowley spoke in Thurmont, Md., where he is part of the group of
American officials supporting the Middle East peace conference at
Camp David sponsored by President Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   A State Department official said the United States would
continue its ''very extensive efforts to stop the proliferation of
missile technology and equipment to Iran.''
</P>
<P>
   ''We continue to place a high priority on this important missile
nonproliferation issue and to work closely with other like-minded
countries to stop the flow of sensitive missile items to Iran,''
the official said.

<HEADLINE> Firefighting Plane Crashes in Greece  </HEADLINE>
By LISA ORKIN
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATHENS, Greece (AP) -- A Greek firefighting plane crashed
Saturday, killing two air force pilots as they battled wildfires
raging across Greece for a third day.
</P>
<P>
   Officials said four big forest fires continued to burn around
the country, four were abating, six were under control and two were
extinguished.
</P>
<P>
   Just north of Greece in Bulgaria, two people died after
suffering severe burns and five were injured in fighting wildfires
in the province of Haskovo. A state of emergency was in force in
the province.
</P>
<P>
   Turkey's Forestry Minister Nami Cagan said Friday that close to
60 fires destroyed some 7,163 acres of brush and pine forest since
a heat wave started last week.
</P>
<P>
   In Greece, the majority of the fires were around Corinth -- 50
miles southwest of the capital -- where a state of emergency was
declared. Those fires have destroyed an undetermined amount of
forest and burned more than 50 homes.
</P>
<P>
   Some 5,000 firefighters fought the blazes with help from foreign
aircraft sent Friday by Greece. Israel, Germany, the Czech Republic
and Russia.
</P>
<P>
   At daybreak, a Canadair CL-215 aircraft slammed into a mountain
on the east coast of Greece, killing both air force pilots. The
fire that the pilots were fighting was 200 miles northeast of
Athens and was among those abating.
</P>
<P>
   ''This tragic incident reflects the heroism and the altruism of
all the firefighting forces,'' said Premier Costas Simitis.
</P>
<P>
   Firefighters worked overnight to extinguish the fires burning
around the country and began using aircraft shortly after daybreak.
</P>
<P>
   Greece uses about 10 helicopters and 30 airplanes for
firefighting, most of them Canadair seaplanes which replenish their
water supply to fight fires by skimming over the water while a
trapdoor opens to take in the water.
</P>
<P>
   Many firefighters were close to exhaustion after having battled
more than 1,100 blazes since the beginning of July.
</P>
<P>
   The government said about 26,000 soldiers were patrolling
Greece's forests to spot any new outbreaks of fires.
</P>
<P>
   Rain was forecast for much of Greece starting Monday, but
officials said conditions would remain hazardous over the weekend.

<HEADLINE> Scandal Rocks Brazilian Leader  </HEADLINE>
By PETER MUELLO
<TEXT>
<P>
   RIO DE JANEIRO, Brazil (AP) -- A new political scandal involving
top aides of President Fernando Henrique Cardoso has raised
questions about his ability to steer Brazil's budding economic
recovery.
</P>
<P>
   Corruption allegations have been leveled at Eduardo Jorge Caldas
Pereira, a former top presidential aide, and Planning and Budget
Minister Martus Tavares. While the government denies any
wrongdoing, the scandal keeps growing.
</P>
<P>
   Opposition congressmen are demanding a formal inquiry into the
links between Pereira and fugitive judge Nicolau dos Santos Neto,
convicted of embezzling nearly $100 million budgeted to build a
courthouse in Sao Paulo.
</P>
<P>
   In a published interview, Pereira admitted that Santos Neto
helped the government appoint labor court judges who would not
index wages to inflation, a key to the success of Cardoso's 1994
anti-inflation plan. But new allegations suggest their relationship
went a lot further.
</P>
<P>
   Santos Neto's phone records listed more than 100 calls to
Pereira. And an expose by IstoE newsmagazine indicated that Pereira
and Tavares were instrumental in approving millions of dollars in
extra funds for the judge's courthouse in 1995 and 1996.
</P>
<P>
   IstoE's latest issue contains transcripts of phone conversations
the magazine said were taped by the federal police and the
Brazilian Intelligence Agency during a yearlong investigation of
Santos Neto. In one exchange, the judge boasts how impressed
Tavares was to learn that Pereira was his ''protector'' in the
government.
</P>
<P>
   Tavares later issued a statement saying there was no reason to
deny the funds before 1998, when Brazil's General Accounting Office
reported irregularities with the courthouse construction. The extra
funds also were approved by the Congress, he added.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the news took a toll on financial markets. After the
magazine hit newsstands Thursday, Brazil's benchmark Bovespa stock
index plunged 3.6 percent to finish at a two-week low, although it
rebounded Friday. Markets sustained the rise through closing.
</P>
<P>
   Cardoso called an emergency Cabinet meeting Thursday night, but
the government denied reports that Tavares would resign.
</P>
<P>
   Although the magazine report also indicated that three senators
and one lower-chamber legislators helped to cover up the
overbilling, the big question was how the scandal would affect
Cardoso's effectiveness to lead the economy back to prosperity
after last year's recession.
</P>
<P>
   ''There is no way this doesn't touch the president,'' said
political consultant Jose Luciano Dias of the think tank Goes e
Consultores in Brasilia, the capital. ''It will hurt him, but the
government still can quash it with relatively small damage.''
</P>
<P>
   Dias said the government coalition in Congress was strong enough
to block a panel of inquiry, and without a ''smoking gun'' the
scandal would tend to deflate.
</P>
<P>
   ''In a serious country it would be grounds for impeachment,''
said Dias. ''But this is Brazil.''

<HEADLINE> Lazio filing shows almost $5 million raised  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	   ALBANY, N.Y. (AP) - Rep. Rick Lazio raised more than $4.96
million during the second quarter of this year as he geared up for
his U.S. Senate race against Hillary Rodham Clinton, aides said
Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   Summary pages from a report prepared for filing with the Federal
Election Commission showed the Long Island Republican with almost
$6.2 million still in his campaign account. He spent almost $2.32
million during the three-month period.
</P>
<P>
   Lazio reported raising more than $4.4 million from individuals
and almost $551,000 from political action committees.
</P>
<P>
   Details of exactly where Lazio's money came from and what it was
spent on were to be made available on Monday when the congressman's
full FEC report is made public.
</P>
<P>
   The first lady's summary pages were expected to be released
Sunday with her full FEC report made public on Monday, campaign
spokesman Howard Wolfson said.
</P>
<P>
   At the end of June, the Clinton campaign estimated it had raised
$5.1 million during the three-month period and said it expected to
report about $6.4 million on hand.
</P>
<P>
   In those end-of-June projections, the Lazio campaign had
estimated its fund raising for the period at more than $4.5 million
and said it expected to have about $5.4 million on hand.
</P>
<P>
   ''We are very proud to have generated such incredible support in
such a short period of time,'' said Lazio campaign manager Bill Dal
Col on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   Lazio only entered the race on May 20 after Mayor Rudolph
Giuliani quit the contest in the face of prostate cancer and
marital problems.

<HEADLINE> State, local officials gear up for school construction funds  </HEADLINE>
By KATHLEEN CANNON
<TEXT>
<P>
   TRENTON, N.J. (AP) - The head of the agency charged with
overseeing New Jersey's largest public works project is heeding
advice from her father, a retired salesman.
</P>
<P>
   ''He always said if competitors have good ideas, steal them,''
said Caren Franzini, executive director of the state Economic
Development Authority.
</P>
<P>
   So Franzini will be traveling around the country, learning how
other agencies handle such massive undertakings as New Jersey's
multibillion dollar school building program.
</P>
<P>
   Under the bill given final legislative approval last week, the
EDA will oversee the $8.6 billion state plan to rebuild and
renovate facilities in nearly all New Jersey's school districts.
</P>
<P>
   Most of that money, $6 billion, will be reserved for 30 poor
school districts that successfully sued the state for full funding
in the landmark Abbott vs. Burke lawsuit.
</P>
<P>
   All those special needs school districts, plus about 50 more
that receive high levels of state aid, must go through the EDA for
their building projects, under the bill that awaits Gov. Christie
Whitman's signature.
</P>
<P>
   Other districts have the choice of having the state manage their
construction or doing it themselves.
</P>
<P>
   So Franzini will be in charge of more than $6 billion worth of
construction in at least 80 districts.
</P>
<P>
   ''The EDA is honored that the governor and the Legislature
thought well enough of us to do this,'' she said. ''We feel this a
challenge, and a wonderful opportunity.''
</P>
<P>
   Now that the Legislature has finally passed the bill following
two years of haggling, attention now turns to the EDA. The obscure
branch of state government was created in 1974 to boost the state's
economy by issuing bonds, making loans and offering technical
assistance to business start-ups.
</P>
<P>
   The EDA is no stranger to building projects, having managed $1.3
billion worth of construction over the years. Some of its projects
include a technical center in North Brunswick, an office complex in
Trenton and the new Bergen County office building.
</P>
<P>
   ''What is different is, no one has ever had this magnitude of
construction,'' Franzini said, noting that the special needs
districts alone comprise 420 individual school buildings.
</P>
<P>
   To accomplish its new responsibility, the EDA will be hiring
about 40 new staff members to operate a new division reserved for
school construction financing and management.
</P>
<P>
   One of its key tasks will be to keep the lines of communication
open among itself, school districts and the state Department of
Education, which will have final say on what kind of school
projects will be granted state aid.
</P>
<P>
   Still, David Sciarra, head of the Education Law Center, which
sued the state on behalf of the poor children, is worried that the
true needs of the poor schools will become lost in this new state
bureaucracy. He wants the Legislature to keep close tabs on how the
state responds to the challenge.
</P>
<P>
   ''This is a massive undertaking, and they have no track record.
There's going to be major problems,'' he said in a recent
interview.
</P>
<P>
   Sciarra blames the state Department of Education for throwing
regulatory roadblocks in the path of the special needs schools. It
rejects major parts of their five-year facilities plans, sets vague
appeal timelines and writes flawed regulations, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ''They've been doing this for two or three years. We're tired of
this. It has to stop,'' he said. ''They would never treat suburban
districts like this.''
</P>
<P>
   John Crosbie, a Department of Education spokesman, denied
Sciarra's charges. The department will give the requests of special
needs districts a thorough and fair review, taking in account the
fact that tax money is at stake, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ''As negotiations continue, people will see we're being prudent,
not unfair,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to reviewing all the special needs school district
plans, the department also must approve construction plans for any
of New Jersey's 616 school districts that apply for state said. So
like the EDA, it too must hire extra staff to assist with the extra
work, Crosbie said.
</P>
<P>
   The department will work with the EDA to ensure the construction
project goes smoothly, he said.
</P>
<P>
   School superintendents hope he's right
</P>
<P>
   Gerald Kohn, superintendent of Vineland schools, said his
district is desperate for the extra aid to address overcrowded
conditions. Local officials are going to Trenton this week, in
fact, to fine tune their facilities plans with the state, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ''We heartily welcome the infusion of much needed financial
resources to build the classrooms that have been lacking for many
years,'' he said.

<HEADLINE> Moderate Serbs May Be in Elections  </HEADLINE>
By ROBERT H. REID
<TEXT>
<P>
   PRISTINA, Yugoslavia (AP) -- In a sign of division in Kosovo Serb
ranks, Serb moderates said they might participate in the province's
first internationally supervised elections in Serbian areas where
NATO can provide security.
</P>
<P>
   Saturday had been the deadline for Kosovars of all groups --
Albanian, Serb, Turkish, Gypsies and others -- to register for
municipal elections in October.
</P>
<P>
   U.N. administrator Bernard Kouchner extended the deadline until
the close of business Wednesday to enable Serbs and others to
register to vote.
</P>
<P>
   The United Nations needs substantial participation from all
ethnic groups to give legitimacy to the balloting.
</P>
<P>
   In a statement late Friday, Serbs in Gracanica, who are
associated with the Serbian Orthodox Church, said they would agree
to elections where ''there is a minimum of conditions that
municipal authorities actually function.'' Gracanica, a monastery
town, is about five miles south of Pristina.
</P>
<P>
   U.N. sources, speaking on condition of anonymity, said the Serb
community in the small town of Leposavic in northern Kosovo was
also interested in registering.
</P>
<P>
   Serb leaders in Kosovska Mitrovica, however, remain opposed to
voting until the United Nations allows 1,500 Serbs to return this
month and draws up a firm timetable to allow another 210,000 to
come home.
</P>
<P>
   U.N. officials have resisted the demand. The outgoing Kosovo
chief of the U.N. refugee agency, Dennis McNamara, said a premature
return of Serbs would worsen the already tense ethnic climate in
the province.
</P>
<P>
   Thousands of Serbs fled the province when Yugoslav troops and
police withdrew in June 1999 after NATO's 78-day bombing of
Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
   The Serbs who stayed have been attacked by armed ethnic
Albanians seeking to drive the remaining 100,000 Serbs from the
province.
</P>
<P>
   Dragisa Milovic, a Serb official in Kosovska Mitrovica, said:
''We have absolutely no security in Kosovo, nor are we able to move
around. Under those conditions, any election would be absurd.''
</P>
<P>
   Late Friday, a grenade was fired from an Albanian neighborhood
into the Serb sector of Kosovska Mitrovica. No injuries were
reported.
</P>
<P>
   The blast prompted rumors that a popular Serb cafe had been hit,
and angry Serbs flooded into the area. They dispersed early
Saturday when peacekeepers convinced them the cafe was not hit.
</P>
<P>
   Minutes later, another grenade was fired toward a complex of
three apartment buildings on the Serb side, exploding in an empty
apartment, NATO said.

<HEADLINE> Man pleads guilty in fatal crash  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	   TOMS RIVER, N.J. (AP) - A Freehold Township man faces 10 years
in prison after admitting he caused the accident that killed a New
York couple but spared their baby daughter.
</P>
<P>
   Gary Tirpak, 26, pleaded guilty to two counts of vehicular
homicide and a single count of vehicular assault. He also admitted
driving while intoxicated, improper passing and reckless driving.
</P>
<P>
   He told Superior Court Judge Edward Turnbach on Friday that he
had been drinking shortly before the accident. His blood alcohol
content after the crash was 0.247, more than twice New Jersey's
legal limit of 0.10.
</P>
<P>
   Authorities said Tirpak's pickup truck was northbound on Route
537 last August when he went through a red light and broadsided a
car driven by Jhoni Rojas, of Long Island City, N.Y.
</P>
<P>
   Rojas died four days later. His wife, Jeannie, died at the
scene. Their daughter, who was 1 at the time and in the back seat
with her mother, has since recovered.
</P>
<P>
   Under the plea agreement, Tirpak faces 10 years in prison when
he is sentenced Sept. 15.
</P>
<P>
   Executive Assistant Ocean County Prosecutor John Mercun said the
families of the victims were satisfied and felt justice had been
served.

<HEADLINE> Nurse vies for vacant Assembly seat  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	   ROCHESTER, N.Y. (AP) - A nurse has jumped into the race for the
state Assembly seat vacated by Jerry Johnson, who was imprisoned in
April for burglarizing a female aide's home.
</P>
<P>
   Christine Saltzberg, 49, who lives in the Rochester suburb of
Pittsford, officially declared her Democratic candidacy Saturday
for the mainly rural 136th district, which extends across
Livingston, Monroe and Allegany counties in western New York.
</P>
<P>
   Saltzberg said she's seeking political office for the first time
''for many of the same reasons I went into nursing in the first
place - I care about people and I know I can make a difference in
their lives.''
</P>
<P>
   A native of Texas, Saltzberg moved to Rochester in 1977 and has
been a registered nurse for 29 years. She has lobbied in Albany for
nursing-related organizations, served on the faculty at the
University of Rochester and is studying for a doctorate in
education.
</P>
<P>
   Republicans are backing Joseph Errigo of Conesus, a retired
court reporter and a county commissioner on the Rochester-Genesee
Regional Transportation Authority.
</P>

   Johnson, a Republican, agreed to a felony plea deal that ended
his 28-year political career and put him in jail for up to 12
months. He was elected to the first of four terms in the state
Assembly in 1992 and had been up for re-election.

<HEADLINE> Cape May-Lewes Ferry must improve food safety  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	   LEWES, Del. (AP) - The operators of the Cape May-Lewes Ferry
must improve hygiene and food handling within two weeks or they
will lose the right to serve food during the 70-minute crossing.
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. Food and Drug Administration late last month found the
food operations ''potentially hazardous'' to passengers' health,
with food stored at inappropriate temperatures, toxic chemicals
stored too close to food and plumbing insufficient to keep the
drinking water clean.
</P>
<P>
   The federal agency gave the authority until July 28 to clean up
its act or be prevented from offering any food service until the
FDA determines otherwise. The agency could also seek a permanent
court injunction to shut down the food operation.
</P>
<P>
   FDA inspectors returned for a surprise inspection this week when
one passenger complained of food poisoning after reports of the
June inspections were published.
</P>
<P>
   The five ferries operated by the Delaware River &AMP; Bay Authority
last year fed about 910,000 people. The ferry operations lose money
each year, but food concessions brought in about $4.5 million with
a profit of about $400,000 in 1999.
</P>
<P>
   The Twin Capes and MV Cape May ferries received failing scores
during the mid-June, routine inspection. The FDA found 11
violations of federal health laws, several of which it said ''would
significantly contribute to the potential of food-borne illness.''
</P>
<P>
   In a June 20 letter to the FDA, Jeffrey D. Lewis, chief
operating officer of the authority, outlined corrective steps he
said were being taken. He said the authority has ''a tremendous
sense of urgency'' to solve the problems and wants to ''exceed the
expectations'' of the federal agency.
</P>
<P>
   The FDA granted the authority provisional status to continue
offering food, but gave the authority 30 days to come into full
compliance.
</P>
<P>
   Among the problems listed in the FDA warning letter in June were
food stored at improper temperatures. Uncooked sausage patties, for
example, were stored at 63 degrees, about 20 degrees above the
required temperature.
</P>
<P>
   Some employees were preparing food without gloves and didn't
wash their hands between preparations. Others did not wear
hairnets.
</P>

   The bistate authority operates the Interstate 95 Delaware
Memorial Twin Bridges, three airports, and the Cape May-Lewes
Ferry, which it describes on its Web site as ''the nation's most
luxurious.'' Each vessel can carry up to 100 cars. All ferries
offer deli selections and salads. The two refurbished ferries also
offer a $15.95 buffet dinner.

<P>
   The authority took over food operations from a private
contractor in 1996. Mike Owens, the former ferry operations
manager, said this week that the foodservice department has been
plagued by turnover. The authority has had three food service
managers in the past three years.

<HEADLINE> Colombia Against Using Fungus  </HEADLINE>
By JARED KOTLER
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOGOTA, Colombia (AP) -- The Colombian government says it has no
intention of testing or even further studying a fungus promoted by
the United Nations and the United States as a potential ''silver
bullet'' for killing coca plants.
</P>
<P>
   In an interview, environment minister Juan Mayr said the U.S.
State Department ''told lies'' when it reported last week that
Colombia had agreed to field test the fungus before deciding
whether to it use against cocaine-producing plants.
</P>
<P>
   ''We will not accept the introduction of any foreign element,
which is what they have offered us under the name Fusarium
oxysporum,'' Mayr told The Associated Press on Friday, adding that:
''We have told them to forget it.''
</P>
<P>
   Mayr said a team of scientists from the government, Bogota's
National University, and several prestigious private institutes
examined the plan presented several months ago under U.N. auspices,
and rejected it categorically.
</P>
<P>
   They warned of possible mutations and adverse affects on people
and the environment in the delicate Amazon basin, where most of
Colombia's coca is grown.
</P>
<P>
   Based on expert opinions, ''I think it makes no sense to permit
the entry of an external biological agent that can have an adverse
affect on our ecosystems,'' said Mayr, who has the authority to
reject the use of any herbicide based on the fungus in Colombia.
</P>
<P>
   Mayr said the government would welcome funding for research into
alternative biological controls based on ''blights'' or even
insects already present in the coca-growing areas.
</P>
<P>
   He said there was no evidence that Fusarium oxysporum -- an
outbreak of which ravaged coca in Peru in the early 1990s -- exists
in the southern states where most of the nearly 300,000 acres of
coca are grown. Nor does the government plan to look for it
further, Mayr added.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, a State Department spokesman said reports that
Colombia had agreed to a U.S.-funded testing program were accurate.
The New York Times reported on July 6 that the Colombian government
had agreed to such a program under U.S. pressure.
</P>
<P>
   Washington's leverage here is undoubtedly growing as Colombia
prepares to receive the bulk of a $1.3 billion U.S. aid package
President Clinton signed on Thursday for stemming an explosion of
cocaine production in the South American country.
</P>
<P>
   The aid, much of it for military helicopters, would permit
increased aerial eradication of coca crops using chemical
herbicides already approved by Mayr's ministry. Armed leftist
rebels entrenched in the coca regions have impeded fumigation,
often firing on crop dusting planes.
</P>
<P>
   The rebels and peasant coca farmers contend chemical spraying
causes illnesses, and kills food crops as well as coca -- not to
mention forcing growers to cut down more virgin forest in order to
replant their wilted crops.
</P>
<P>
   The development of a safe, nontoxic, Fusarium-based herbicide
that kills only the coca would ''obviate these concerns'' argued
the spurned U.N. proposal, which was to be funded with a $300,000
grant from the U.S. Department of Agriculture.
</P>
<P>
   But according to Mayr, many of the complaints about the approved
herbicide -- known as glyphosate -- are highly exaggerated. He said
it would be better to keep spraying glyphosate while developing
biological alternatives than to introduce a potentially hazardous
fungus.
</P>
<P>
   Amid complaints from environmentalists, the state of Florida
last year ditched a plan to test a strain of Fusarium against
marijuana crops.
</P>
<P>
   Colombians wonder why the U.S. government is so eager to use it
in their country.
</P>
<P>
   ''Why apply it, even in a test, on Colombian territory and not
in the United States?'' Bogota's leading El Tiempo newspaper said
in its editorial on Saturday. ''Is destroying coca a mission to be
carried out at any cost, without any considerations?''

<HEADLINE> Psst: Wanna buy a steam locomotive?  </HEADLINE>
By WAYNE PARRY
<TEXT>
<P>
   KEARNY, N.J. (AP) - Psst: Wanna buy a steam locomotive?
</P>
<P>
   For anywhere from $1 million to $3 million, you can buy the
Chesapeake &AMP; Ohio No. 614, the last steam passenger locomotive
built in the United States. The owner will even throw in two
auxiliary cars for free.
</P>
<P>
   Rail buffs, train lovers and Lionel fans: stick THIS under your
kid's Christmas tree. It's an 890,000-pound, 112-foot long, fully
functional steam locomotive that can reach speeds of 125 mph.
</P>
<P>
   The train, which made tourist runs on NJ Transit tracks between
Port Jervis, N.Y., and Hoboken in the 1990s, is being sold because
its owner recently moved to Canada and plans a new tourist railroad
with bridges that can't support the weight of old No. 614.
</P>
<P>
   With such a hefty price tag, the average rail buff won't be able
to afford it; so far, it's been offered to Microsoft founder Bill
Gates, Wall Street whiz Warren Buffett, and actor Kevin Costner -
all acknowledged train fanciers - but they haven't bitten.
</P>
<P>
   An auction Saturday at NJ Transit Meadows Maintenance Facility
drew a high bid of only $200,000, well below what owner Ross
Rowland Jr. says it's worth. An auctioneer will work next week with
others who expressed interest in the train to see if an acceptable
bid can be negotiated, Rowland said.
</P>
<P>
   ''It was the last mainline steam engine built in North America
in 1948, as railroads were transitioning from steam to diesel,''
said Rowland, who has owned No. 614 since 1979, when he bought it
from the CSX railroad. ''It's been thoroughly refurbished and
updated, and it's the only steam locomotive in North America that
has all the equipment and appliances you'd need to pull an Amtrak
train.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, it is the only steam engine ever leased by Amtrak,
having pulled ''The Cardinal'' through West Virginia at speeds
approaching 80 miles an hour.
</P>
<P>
   The locomotive has a proud history in American railroading. When
it rolled out of the Lima Locomotive Works in Ohio in January 1948,
it pulled the Chesapeake &AMP; Ohio Railroad's premier express
passenger trains, ''The George Washington'' and ''The Fast Flying
Virginian'' between Richmond, Va. and Chicago.
</P>
<P>
   It was retired from service in 1952 and relegated to a storage
roundhouse in Kentucky for nearly two decades.
</P>
<P>
   In 1976, it was underwent a facelift and was donated to the
Baltimore &AMP; Ohio Railroad Museum in Baltimore.
</P>
<P>
   When Rowland bought it, he oversaw a crew of 15 mechanics and
more than 100 volunteers who completely rebuilt the locomotive,
which generates power by burning coal and dumping water on the
embers to generate steam to power its giant pistons that turn the
wheels. It took 18 months and $1.5 million to bring No. 614 up to
snuff; it can now pull a 25-car passenger train all day without
having to stop for service.
</P>
<P>
   Rowland most recently used it for ''Iron Horse Rambles'' along
NJ Transit's Port Jervis tracks; nearly 17,000 people, some from as
far away as Australia, New Zealand and Japan, have paid for the
chance to ride behind the restored steam engine.
</P>
<P>
   He's starting up a new tourist railroad in Victoria, British
Columbia, but can't use the black and silver behemoth on those
tracks. Bridges in the area can handle about 200 tons, Rowland
said; No. 614 weighs more than twice that.
</P>
<P>
   Rowland has been a train nut ever since he was a kid. Yes, he
said, he had a set of Lionel toy trains when he was 4 years old.
</P>
<P>
   ''But I quickly grew tired of those, and wanted the big ones,
the real ones,'' he said. ''I've been in love with trains ever
since I was a kid; I still am today.''
</P>
<P>
   Ron Anderson of Yonkers, N.Y. works for the New York City
Transit Authority, maintaining trains. He stopped by the auction
just to take a peek at some living history.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's the last of its type,'' he said as a light rain vaporized
on the heated locomotive Saturday morning. ''I've seen it go on a
lot of excursions, and I just wanted to see it one last time.''
</P>
<P>
   The romance of the steam engine era is a main motivation for
collectors like Rowland who buy and lovingly maintain the old
trains.
</P>
<P>
   ''Walt Disney, who was a huge rail buff, said it best: 'With a
steam engine, it's a happening; with a diesel, it's another
train,''' Rowland said. ''Every kid in school learns about the
importance of the steam engine in the development of the nation.
</P>
<P>
   ''Without the steam engine, there would have been no westward
expansion,'' he said. ''It enabled the industrial revolution and
the population of the western two-thirds of the United States.
Combine that with the sights and sounds of a steam engine as it
passes by you - the hiss of the steam, the sound of the whistle,
the way the ground shakes underneath you - and it's almost an alive
machine.''

<HEADLINE> Citing neglect, state shuts home for elderly in Montvale  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	   MONTVALE, N.J. (AP) - Nine unwashed, underfed tenants led state
investigators to shut down a Montvale boarding home for the elderly
on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   The residents of the Hillas Vale Guest Lodge, between the ages
of 70 and 90, were glad to leave, officials said.
</P>
<P>
   ''They were living without supervision, 80-year-old people
cleaning their own clothes and cooking their own food, and some of
them paid $1,000 a month to live there,'' said Victor Baykal, chief
of the state Bureau of Rooming and Boarding House Standards.
</P>
<P>
   The owner of the home, Maureen Culhane, faces no further
disciplinary action beyond its closing.
</P>
<P>
   The nine seniors did not have any serious health problems,
although all were noticeably thin, said Jay Meyerowitz, medical
director for the Potomac Group homes, where the state temporarily
moved the residents.
</P>
<P>
   ''Emotionally, they were very distraught and very distressed,''
he said. ''They were slightly disheveled. I would say unkempt. They
looked like they hadn't been provided baths or clean clothes for a
while.''
</P>
<P>
   Residents told officials they had been left with nothing to eat
but spaghetti sauce for one three-day stretch.
</P>
<P>
   State investigators had tried twice before to shut down the
home, but each time they returned, they found better supervision
than when they had initially visited.

<HEADLINE> Report: Russian Army Train Bombed  </HEADLINE>
By RUSLAN MUSAYEV
<TEXT>
<P>
   NAZRAN, Russia (AP) -- A woman was killed and six servicemen were
wounded Saturday when an explosion ripped through a Russian
military train in the restive republic of Chechnya, a news report
said.
</P>
<P>
   NTV commercial television said that the train's locomotive was
hauling two carloads of soldiers toward Russian headquarters in
Khankala, a suburb of the capital Grozny. The blast occurred near
the town of Dzhalka, killing a cook and injuring six of the men.
</P>
<P>
   The train was disabled and the soldiers walked the remaining 10
miles to Khankala, the report said.
</P>
<P>
   Officials in the office of Sergei Yastrzhembsky, the chief
government spokesman on Chechnya, did not confirm the attack, the
Interfax news agency reported.
</P>
<P>
   Remote-controlled bombs along roads have been a favorite rebel
tactic, and soldiers have been combing rail lines to ward off bomb
attacks.
</P>
<P>
   The attack comes after a relative lull in rebel action following
truck bomb attacks on July 2 that killed and wounded dozens of
soldiers.
</P>
<P>
   Three Russian servicemen were injured late Friday when wayward
fire from Russian artillery struck their helicopter pad at
Khankala, Interior Ministry officials said. According to Interfax,
the commander of an artillery unit issued incorrect target data.
</P>
<P>
   A tank was hit, but a helicopter on the pad was undamaged, NTV
reported. It took off after the rounds fell.
</P>
<P>
   The report showed swearing, shirtless Russian soldiers
frantically dousing the smoking tank with a fire hose to prevent
its munitions from exploding.
</P>
<P>
   The misdirected rounds came from a unit that was shelling
Chechen rebels in the forest near Khankala, said Col. Sergei
Matveyev, chief of artillery and missile forces in the region, the
ITAR-Tass news agency reported.
</P>
<P>
   It quoted Col. Gen. Valery Manilov, deputy head of the General
Staff, as saying that one defective shell went astray and hit the
tank.
</P>
<P>
   Security at border crossings and checkpoints inside Chechnya was
stepped up early Saturday, but restrictions on people trying to
leave Chechnya have not been introduced, the military command's
press center said.
</P>
<P>
   Many Chechens were trying to leave the republic following rumors
of impending rebel attacks. There were long lines at the border as
Russian troops searched people more thoroughly, officials said.
</P>
<P>
   Interfax quoted Taus Dzhabrailov, spokesman for the Russian
civilian administration in Chechnya, as saying that the rumors
''are spread to keep the people afraid and force them to flee their
homes.''
</P>
<P>
   Russian troops were driven out of Chechnya in a 1994-96 war.
They returned in September, after Islamic militants raided several
villages in neighboring Dagestan and after about 300 people died in
apartment bombings the government blames on Chechens.
</P>
<P>
   Federal troops have taken control of most of Chechnya. But
guerrillas have eluded Russian forces by using the forests and
mountains to conceal their movements and encampments.

<HEADLINE> 'Cop's cop' Sardino, former Syracuse police chief, dies  </HEADLINE>
AP Photos
<TEXT>
<P>
   SYRACUSE, N.Y. (AP) - Former Syracuse Police Chief Thomas J.
Sardino, who began his career raiding gambling joints alone on his
off-hours then pioneered community policing, is dead.
</P>
<P>
   The tough, compassionate cop died Friday of heart failure at 72.
</P>
<P>
   Sardino was respected statewide and nationally. His innovative
approach included pioneering work in community policing, the
program that puts more officers walking and touring the streets and
talking to residents to try to head-off crime before it happens. He
also started the city's first neighborhood watch program in the
city back in 1978.
</P>
<P>
   The chief with a master's degree in business administration from
Syracuse University left the Syracuse police force after 15 years
as chief in 1985. He then moved to Upper Marlboro, Md., to lead the
Amtrak federal police force until he suffered a stroke in 1994 and
returned to central New York.
</P>
<P>
   He is a former president of the New York State Association of
Chiefs of Police and of the International Association of Chiefs of
Police.
</P>
<P>
   Sardino joined the police department after two years in the Army
during the Korean War and rose through the ranks with extraordinary
speed. He made sergeant after five years, lieutenant after another
five years, and captain five years later, after scoring the highest
mark on record for the state on the civil service exam.
</P>
<P>
   In the late 1950s newspapers called Sardino a one-man vice
squad. Alone on the streets, he spent off-duty hours raiding
illegal gambling enterprises. He wanted to send a message that the
police department was not going to be lax in going after gamblers.
</P>
<P>
   He went on to become the city's longest-sitting police chief,
the author of four books on policing that were studied in police
academies across the country and in foreign nations, and head of a
worldwide association of police chiefs. He was the calming
influence in volatile demonstrations at Syracuse University and at
riots on city streets.
</P>
<P>
   ''Tom's life revolved around the city of Syracuse and the police
department,'' said his wife, Nina Sardino, who would occasionally
ride along with him on patrol. ''He was a lucky person. He had a
job that he absolutely loved.''
</P>
<P>
   A sharp-dresser, Sardino's craggy face and his trademark cigar
were fixtures at city crime scenes for nearly three decades.
</P>
<P>
   Known for his fairness as well as his toughness, Sardino was a
nationally recognized police chief until then Mayor-elect Tom Young
replaced him.
</P>
<P>
   ''The Sardino name is synonymous with law enforcement,''
Syracuse Mayor Roy Bernardi said Friday. ''Tom Sardino epitomized
what law enforcement is about. He was tough on crime but could step
back and see the big picture.''
</P>
<P>
   Bernardi ordered city flags flown at half-staff.
</P>
<P>
   Sardino's reputation was built in part for his actions in 1970,
when Syracuse University was home to protests of the Vietnam war.
Some protesters sought to take the marches to the streets.
</P>
<P>
   Sardino arrives, chomping his cigar. Students are yelling.
Sardino takes control.
</P>
<P>
   There's no riot, no tear gas, no fires, no bottle throwing.
Instead, Sardino gives students the go-ahead for their march, on
two conditions. The march must be orderly, and Sardino must lead
it.
</P>
<P>
   That calm in the face of disorder was repeated at Syracuse
University 15 years later during an anti-apartheid protest. The
school demanded students remove their shacks and banners, but
Sardino said he wouldn't step in.
</P>
<P>
   ''You've got the right to demonstrate, and we're going to
protect that right as long as it's peaceful and nonviolent,'' he
told the cheering students.
</P>
<P>
   In 1983, former Lt. George Georgiadi accused then Mayor Lee
Alexander and Sardino, who once considered running for mayor, of
asking him to perform dirty tricks for them during the 1977 mayoral
race. An Onondaga County grand jury issued no indictments in the
case.
</P>
<P>
   ''He was a remarkable guy,'' Georgiadi said Friday. ''You got to
give the devil his due. Probably one of the greatest cops there
ever was in Syracuse. He was honest, dedicated, didn't play games,
didn't pull punches. In my mind, he just got political.''
</P>
<P>
   Sardino once offered himself as a lightning rod during a
neighborhood riot that broke out on Labor Day one year, said
Richard Haumann, Sardino's friend and deputy chief for several
years. About 100 people were battling on a city street with fists,
rocks and sticks.
</P>
<P>
   ''He went into the middle of the street so that he became the
target,'' said Haumann, who accompanied his mentor. Sardino stood
his ground as he was pelted with rocks. ''He got hurt. We both got
hurt,'' Haumann said. ''He had no fear.''
</P>
<P>
   The Rev. Frank Halse, who was the Methodist chaplain at Syracuse
University, said the protests reached a boiling point on the day of
the Kent State shootings.
</P>
<P>
   The students were on a tear at the campus and had lighted oxygen
bottles that were strewn all over the construction site for a new
geology building. Sardino showed up the next morning with trucks to
get the oxygen bottles to avoid injuries. In a steady, calm voice,
Sardino negotiated with the protesters and stood by while the
bottles were taken out.
</P>
<P>
   ''All the time he was doing this, there was a kid pounding on
him, calling him every four-letter word in the world,'' Halse said.
''And (Sardino) never turned a hair.''
</P>
<P>
   Sardino thanked the protesters, then put his arm around the kid
who was screaming at him.
</P>
<P>
   ''You're all right, kid,'' Sardino told him.
</P>
<P>
   ''The kid broke down in tears and fell into (Sardino's) chest,
and he just held him and let the kid cry it out,'' Halse said. ''It
was beautiful. To me, it was the essence of the man's character on
display.''
</P>
<P>
   He leaves his wife, Nina, five children and eleven
grandchildren.
</P>
<P>
   A funeral with full honors is planned for Monday at the
Cathedral of the Immaculate Conception in Syracuse.

<HEADLINE> Iran Tests Ballistic Missile  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   TEHRAN, Iran (AP) -- Iran test-fired the Shahab-3 missile
Saturday, Tehran television reported, the second trial in two years
for the medium-range weapon capable of reaching Israel or U.S.
troops in Saudi Arabia.
</P>
<P>
   The state broadcast said the test was in line with Iran's
''policy of strengthening its defense capability on the basis of
the principle of deterrence.''
</P>
<P>
   ''This test is not in any way a threat to another country,'' it
quoted an unidentified military source as saying.
</P>
<P>
   The Defense Ministry refused to comment on the report.
</P>
<P>
   In Israel, Deputy Defense Minister Ephraim Sneh expressed
concern Saturday about the missile test ''because Iran actively and
relentlessly undermines the peace process through various terrorist
organizations.''
</P>
<P>
   ''When such a regime has a long-range capacity combined with a
tremendous effort to combine it with nuclear projects, it's of
great concern to Israel,'' Sneh told The Associated Press. He
added, without giving details, that Israel ''is prepared to
forestall'' the dangers of Iran's weapons technology.
</P>
<P>
   Later Saturday, a senior Israeli military intelligence official
said that though this is the first time Iran has the capability to
reach Israel, ''it's not an immediate threat.''
</P>
<P>
   ''At this rate, Iran will have the beginnings of a nuclear
capability by 2005, and will have viable bombs by 2010,'' the
official said. He accused Russia of helping Iran develop the
missiles.
</P>
<P>
   The Clinton administration has said missile threats from
''states of concern'' such as Iran and North Korea necessitate the
development of a controversial, multibillion dollar national
anti-missile defense system.
</P>
<P>
   In Washington, U.S. officials said Saturday that Iran's reported
test-firing of a medium-range missile underscores long-standing
concerns about the risk of weapons proliferation in the Persian
Gulf region.
</P>
<P>
   The officials said Iran's effort to boost its missile
capabilities threatens the area and undermines nonproliferation
efforts.
</P>
<P>
   A State Department official said the United States would
continue its ''very extensive efforts to stop the proliferation of
missile technology and equipment to Iran.''
</P>
<P>
   Western military experts earlier said the missile had failed its
first test in 1998, exploding seconds after launch, a claim Iran
repeatedly has denied.
</P>
<P>
   Iran says the Shahab-3 is a ballistic missile, with a range of
800 miles, and that it can travel at a speed of 4,320 mph with a
1-ton warhead.
</P>
<P>
   Iran is believed to have received missile technology from
Russia, China and North Korea, a claim Tehran has denied. The
Shahab-3 is believed to be based on North Korea's No Dong ballistic
missile.
</P>
<P>
   Iran also is working on the long-range Shahab-4 rocket that it
says will be used only to carry satellites into space -- not for
military purposes.
</P>
<P>
   The Iranians launched an ambitious domestic arms development
program during the 1980-88 war with Iraq to compensate for weapons
shortages caused by a U.S. embargo. Since 1992, Iran has unveiled
its own tanks, armored personnel carriers, missiles, and a fighter
plane.

<HEADLINE> Suspect in assault on police officer rejects plea deal  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	   ROCHESTER, N.Y. (AP) - The man suspected of seriously injuring a
Rochester police officer has rejected a plea bargain.
</P>
<P>
   Edward Jones, who is accused of hitting Officer Scott McLaughlin
with a car while suffering an epileptic seizure, said he would
rather risk a stiffer sentence after a trial than accept a prison
term of 10 years for first-degree assault.
</P>
<P>
   Although he faces up to 25 years behind bars if he's convicted,
Jones is adamant that he didn't intend to cause McLaughlin's
life-threatening brain injuries, said his minister, the Rev. Wilson
Dicker of Northside Church of Christ.
</P>
<P>
   ''There was no evil intent,'' Dicker told the Rochester Democrat
and Chronicle. ''He had a seizure. There's nothing in the law
against having a seizure. But he's sorry it happened.''

<P>
   District Attorney Howard R. Relin said Jones isn't charged with
intentionally injuring McLaughlin.
</P>
<P>
   Jones, 42, is charged with acting with depraved indifference to
human life for failing to take prescribed anti-seizure medication
and driving without a license after a physician warned him against
getting behind the wheel.
</P>
<P>
   McLaughlin, 36, was injured Jan. 16 as he stood on a sidewalk. A
car allegedly driven by Jones jumped the curb and hit McLaughlin,
causing injuries that put McLaughlin in a coma for three weeks.
McLaughlin, who was released from a hospital June 14 and is
recovering well, consented to a plea-bargain that would have given
Jones the minimum prison time allowed for first-degree assault.

<HEADLINE> Pipeline Extinguished in Nigeria  </HEADLINE>
By AMBA DADSON
<TEXT>
<P>
   ADEJE, Nigeria (AP) -- Five days after a pipeline blast killed
200 in southern Nigeria, a blaze caused by the explosion died out
Saturday and villagers were slowly returning to their homes.
</P>
<P>
   The pipeline near the villages of Adeje and Oviri-Court, north
of the oil port of Warri, still gushed fuel but the fire that had
been burning for days fizzled. Twisted bicycles and metal wash
basins remained near a few burned and decaying bodies that had yet
to be collected.
</P>
<P>
   A state petroleum company spokesman warned that pipeline
vandalism across this oil-rich country was increasing despite the
risk posed to perpetrators of sparking yet another explosion or
being arrested or shot by police.
</P>
<P>
   ''Vandalism of our pipelines resulting in frequent fires
constitute a serious national security problem,'' Ndu Ughamadu
said. ''There is an urgent need for the federal government to deal
with the matter.''
</P>
<P>
   After Monday's blast some of the residents in nearby villages
went into hiding out of fear they would be blamed for the blaze.
</P>
<P>
   Although the cause of the blast remains unclear, the pipe had
been punctured by vandals who syphoned off the fuel to sell on the
black market.
</P>
<P>
   The pipeline, which carries fuel from a refinery in Warri to
northern Nigeria, had been vandalized in the same spot seven times
since January, officials said.
</P>
<P>
   Most of those killed in the blast were poor villagers, including
many children, who were scooping up the fuel with pots and cans.
</P>
<P>
   In the days since the blaze, vandals have punctured the pipeline
again, hoping to salvage remaining fuel, an Adeje village resident,
who asked not to be named, said Saturday. The claim could not be
independently confirmed.
</P>
<P>
   On Friday, the toll from the explosion jumped to 200, pushed up
by the discovery of more bodies and the deaths of badly burned
villagers.
</P>
<P>
   The death toll could rise higher still, although exact figures
may never be known. Many of the injured -- including those with
serious burns -- remain in hiding and some of the bodies were
hastily disposed of by villagers.
</P>
<P>
   Red Cross official Wilfred Emovon said authorities were slowly
trying to piece together the scale of the disaster but said
villagers were being uncooperative.
</P>
<P>
   ''It is going to take months before we actually know (how many
were killed and injured). People came from different areas, even
different states,'' Emovon said.
</P>
<P>
   One Adeje resident, a young man who identified himself only as
Moses, worried another disaster was possible because some people
remained determined to collect fuel.
</P>
<P>
   ''Some of these boys are so stubborn,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The state petroleum company has blamed organized crime networks
for encouraging pipeline vandalism and using violence against
security guards and police who try to stop the vandals.
</P>
<P>
   Nigeria is the world's sixth-largest oil exporter, accounting
for about one-twelfth of oil imported by the United States.

<HEADLINE> Water piped from lake depths cools Ivy League campus, incenses foes </HEADLINE>
By BEN DOBBIN
<TEXT>
<P>
   ITHACA, N.Y. (AP) - On humid days, frigid water piped from the
depths of Cayuga Lake keeps everyone cool in the dormitories,
classrooms and research laboratories at Cornell University.
</P>
<P>
   Because there's nothing quite like it anywhere in the world, the
school's new lake-chilled, air-conditioning system could someday be
a model copied in communities that lie next to oceans or deep
inland waters such as the Great Lakes.
</P>
<P>
   ''We're going to a point where the water's consistently cold.
Nobody's gone this deep in a lake before,'' said engineer Lanny
Joyce, who resurrected an old idea championed by Cornell as an
environmental boon but scorned by Ralph Nader as ''an ill-advised
boondoggle.''
</P>
<P>
   The ecological impact of ''lake source cooling'' probably won't
be known for weeks at the earliest, but environmentalists of all
stripes have been feuding for the greenest high ground since the
project began coursing over regulatory hurdles six years ago.
</P>
<P>
   At 425 feet, Cayuga is the second deepest of the 11 fjordlike
Finger Lakes in west-central New York - long, slender exclamation
marks gouged by glaciers during the Ice Age.
</P>
<P>
   In July, a pipeline strung 2 miles north along the lake bed to a
depth of 250 feet began pumping 39-degree Fahrenheit water to a
heat-transfer station near Ithaca. Water that far down hardly
varies in temperature all year long.
</P>
<P>
   The piped lake water, flowing past heat-exchanging steel plates,
absorbs the mugginess in the 12 million-square-foot Ivy League
campus. Never mixing with chemically tainted water in Cornell's
central air-conditioning circuit - a 15-mile loop extended down to
shore - it is then returned 11 to 16 degrees hotter in the lake's
warm, shallow south end.
</P>
<P>
   The $60 million project will slash the school's $1.5 million
annual electricity bill for air conditioning by 80 percent. It will
probably pay for itself in a generation. And it should last 75 to
100 years, twice as long as conventional refrigerators.
</P>
<P>
   What's more, the switchover trims Cornell's reliance on
electricity generated by coal-burning power plants, and dispenses
with chlorofluorocarbons - chemicals in traditional refrigerants
blamed for thinning the Earth's protective ozone layer.
</P>
<P>
   But at what cost to the lake?
</P>
<P>
   A tenacious band of residents worries that the nutrient-rich
discharge into 9 feet of water will create noxious blooms of algae
in a lake basin already dirtied by decades of human interaction.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's like pouring gasoline on a fire,'' said Alex Horne, an
ecological engineering professor at the University of California at
Berkeley who was hired by the Cayuga Lake Defense Fund to evaluate
the project. ''I don't think Cornell can well enough prove they're
not going to cause a nuisance.''
</P>
<P>
   Cornell scientists counter that cool, clear water sucked up from
the dark depths at a maximum summertime rate of 46 million gallons
a day could actually improve the 38-mile-long lake's turbid
southern tip.
</P>
<P>
   ''Algae will bloom in that water moved from the bottom but the
concentration of algae will be lower than the surface water that's
being displaced,'' said Nelson Hairston, an ecology professor at
Cornell who chaired the project's scientific review committee.
</P>
<P>
   The existing soupiness ''might even look a little bit clearer as
a result,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   In any case, Hairston added, two nearby sewage-treatment plants
already send 12 million gallons of treated water into the lake
daily ''and there aren't massive algal blooms.''
</P>
<P>
   To protect aquatic life, mesh screens and a 4-watt light bulb
that repels tiny freshwater shrimp were installed above the
entrance to the 63-inch-wide pipe. Sprinkle holes in the outfall
pipe disperse the warm water over a wide area.
</P>
<P>
   ''There is no no-impact solution to existing ... but Cornell
would not want to do anything that would be harmful to the lake,''
said Joyce, the project manager, standing next to the roiling shore
after a summer storm had barreled through.
</P>
<P>
   ''The amount of heat we're adding each year is equivalent to
about four hours of sunlight. We view this as a cold, renewable
resource. It's not like you use a little of it every year and
eventually it's gone.''
</P>
<P>
   The local Sierra Club chairman, John Kaminsky, believes the
pipeline will have no discernible effect on lake conditions. He
thinks the community would do better to focus on curtailing
unchecked pollutants from ''nonpoint sources'' like lawns, creeks
and storm runoff.
</P>
<P>
   But widespread praise for the project's environmental benefits
has been accompanied by a drumbeat of complaints. Drawing support
from Nader, the Green Party presidential nominee, critics contend
the permit is not only illegal but could weaken the federal Clean
Water Act.
</P>
<P>
   ''Federal law says you can't issue a discharge permit that will
cause or contribute to an existing water-quality violation, and all
5,000 acres of the lake's southern end is impaired,'' said Walter
Hang, who runs a business here that maps toxic sites around New
York.
</P>
<P>
   After obtaining 17 permits from local and state agencies, the
project was scrutinized by the Environmental Protection Agency,
which had placed the lake's south end on a list of ''impaired water
bodies'' in 1998. The lake, Cornell argues, falls into a special
''need more data'' category not covered by federal bans on
discharges.
</P>
<P>
   The EPA, hoping to jump-start a national policy to attack
nonpoint-source pollution, asked if Cornell would volunteer to
serve as a model to test the concept of ''offsets'' - reducing
pollutants from other, diffuse sources in exchange for its pumping
project.
</P>
<P>
   Cornell said no. ''We definitely didn't want to do something
that's quite controversial nationwide and had never been done
before,'' Joyce said. Instead, the school is offering its expertise
in educating the public about ways to cut back on polluting the
watershed.
</P>
<P>
   Horne thinks Cornell would mute criticism by agreeing to an
''offset.''
</P>
<P>
   ''This is one of the best universities in the world, and it's up
to them I think to go the step further,'' he said. ''This is the
normal pollutant trading you would think an advanced society would
be doing by now.''
</P>
<P>
   Another critic, recording engineer Rich DePaolo, thinks the
project has drawn so much attention because it will set a precedent
for not only ''whether this type of technology is implemented
elsewhere but how impaired water bodies are managed throughout the
country.''
</P>
<P>
   So-called non-contact cooling has been widely used in industry
for decades but has yet to catch on as an air-conditioning
alternative.
</P>
<P>
   A similar system operates in Stockholm, Sweden, drawing water
from 60 feet down in the Baltic Sea, and two more are in the works
on Lake Ontario - in Rochester and Toronto, Canada. An ocean-water
experimentation lab in Hawaii that draws water from 2,200 feet also
uses some of the excess energy to air-condition several buildings.
</P>
<P>
   A big, upfront investment, despite the promise of low operating
costs, often proves a big turnoff, said Joe Van Ryzin of Makai
Ocean Engineering in Hawaii, which designed the Cornell pipeline.
But he thinks it's a technology that will prove popular eventually.
</P>
<P>
   ''If Cornell were Wall Street investors, they probably would
have never built it,'' he said. ''However, they're more world and
environmentally conscious than Wall Street and they have the luxury
of being able to choose the high road and do the glorious thing.
</P>
<P>
   ''If a city is at a location where it can do that, it really is
irresponsible not to.''

<HEADLINE> Zimbabwe Promises on Land Plan  </HEADLINE>
By MICHAEL HARTNACK
<TEXT>
<P>
   HARARE, Zimbabwe (AP) -- The leader of a war veterans group said
Saturday that his followers would stay put until he was satisfied
that the government's land redistribution plan was working, defying
an order that his group leave the 1,700 farms they have occupied
for months.
</P>
<P>
   Chenjerai Hunzvi, leader of a group that has spearheaded
occupations of more than 1,600 white-owned farms, made the remarks
shortly after Zimbabwe's Vice President Joseph Msika promised to
hand over 200 formerly white-owned farms to peasants on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   It was unclear whether Hunzvi's supporters were on the 200
farms. The often violent farm invasions have left four white
farmers and at least three farm workers dead.
</P>
<P>
   Tensions mounted as police erected roadblocks on all main roads
leading to Harare and Chengetai Zvauya, a reporter with the
independently owned Sunday Standard, was badly beaten at the war
veterans' meeting after a woman accused him of working for a paper
that did not support them. A newspaper spokesman said Zvauya was
treated for his injuries and filed a police report.
</P>
<P>
   The Commercial Farmers Union, which represents many of the white
farmers, also reported an increase in death threats and attempts to
drive farmers off of their land. The union said it had been told it
would receive a list of farms the government plans to redistribute
on Monday, and that occupiers should start leaving farms ''almost
immediately.''
</P>
<P>
   Msika said Saturday that the government did not expect any
resistance and that war veterans and others were being taken from
some of the 1,700 farms they have occupied and moved to the newly
nationalized land.
</P>
<P>
   Hunzvi, however, said he and his supporters would remain on the
land but allow the government two weeks to declare all occupied
farms state property. He did not specify what he would do if the
government disregarded his instructions.
</P>
<P>
   The government in late May listed more than 800 farms it plans
to seize and redistribute to landless blacks, but owners of about
600 of the farms have launched legal appeals against the
government's proposals. The government says the appeals will likely
be denied.
</P>
<P>
   War veterans and ruling party militants began occupying
white-owned farms in February, after President Robert Mugabe lost a
constitutional referendum that would have empowered him to
nationalize the farms without paying compensation.
</P>
<P>
   The ruling party has since passed a law allowing government to
do so anyway.
</P>
<P>
   Tim Henwood, president of the Commercial Farmers Union, said as
long as things are done within the framework of the law, the
redistribution should go smoothly.
</P>
<P>
   ''Once farmers know what the situation is, and it has settled
down, then farmers will be much happier,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Msika said compensation for the farmers still depended on
''Britain, the former colonial ruler, which created this
situation.''
</P>
<P>
   Britain pledged millions of dollars for land reform at
independence and delivered nearly 90 percent of that money before
freezing the fund in 1990, saying Zimbabwe violated the agreement
by forcing unwilling farmers to sell to the state.
</P>
<P>
   Zimbabwe is facing its worst economic crisis since independence,
and the land crisis has crippled the crucial agriculture sector.
</P>
<P>
   The ruling party won a narrow victory in the June 24-25
parliamentary elections. The main opposition party, the Movement
for Democratic Change, won 57 of 120 contested seats. The previous
parliament had only three opposition delegates.
</P>
<P>
   White farmers currently control about 70 percent of the
country's commercial farmland.

<HEADLINE> Group Says it Bombed Iran Ministry  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   CAIRO, Egypt (AP) -- An Iranian opposition group said it bombed
the headquarters of the Intelligence Ministry in Tehran on Saturday
in response to the government's suppression of demonstrations last
week.
</P>
<P>
   Farid Soleimani, spokesman for the Mujahedeen Khalq, said 20
mortars were fired at the headquarters, causing extensive damage to
the buildings. The Baghdad-based spokesman said several people were
killed or wounded in the evening attack.
</P>
<P>
   Iran's official Islamic Republic News Agency reported the
attack, saying explosions were heard, but offered no other details.
</P>
<P>
   ''The bombing was in response to the bloody suppression of the
anti-government demonstration last Saturday,'' Soleimani told The
Associated Press in Cairo. He said 20 mortars were fired to
commemorate the 20th anniversary of the resistance against the
Iranian regime.
</P>
<P>
   Witnesses in the area said electricity to northeastern Tehran
was briefly cut following the explosions.
</P>
<P>
   On July 8, police fired bullets and tear gas at thousands of
demonstrators marking the one-year anniversary of a police raid on
a university dormitory. At least a dozen people were injured and
scores were arrested.
</P>
<P>
   The Mujahedeen Khalq seeks the violent overthrow of Iran's
Islamic government and frequently carries out attacks on targets
within Iran and along its Iraqi border. Last July the group shelled
the Intelligence Ministry headquarters in the southwestern city of
Dezful in retaliation for the arrests and executions of dissidents.

<HEADLINE> Reports: 13 More Killed in Algeria  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   ALGIERS, Algeria (AP) -- Ongoing violence in Algeria has left 13
people, including a family of four, dead over the past several
days, national newspapers reported Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   Despite a peace drive by President Abdelaziz Bouteflika, Islamic
insurgents continue to carry out daily attacks in this North
African nation. Violence broke out 1992, when the army canceled
legislative elections the now-outlawed Islamic Salvation Front was
set to win.
</P>
<P>
   More than 100,000 people have been killed in the eight years of
fighting since then.
</P>
<P>
   Attackers killed a family of four Friday in their home in Oran,
600 kilometers (370 miles) west of Algiers, the daily El Watan
reported. Neighbors discovered the mutilated bodies of the victims,
whose throats had been slit, the newspaper said.
</P>
<P>
   On Thursday, assailants opened fire on a police patrol that was
passing near Zemmouri, 60 kilometers (37 miles) east of the
capital, killing two officers and wounding another, Liberte daily
reported.
</P>
<P>
   Another attack this week in the eastern town of Taglait left a
City Hall employee dead, Liberte said.
</P>
<P>
   Newspapers also reported that security forces killed six alleged
Islamic militants in two separate crackdowns on Wednesday and
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   The army has been hunting down militants since a January
deadline for insurgents to turn in their weapons in exchange for
partial amnesty, an offer that applied to those who had not
committed rape, murder or bombings.

<HEADLINE> Tax Evasion Filed Against Sharif  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATTOCK FORT, Pakistan (AP) -- Pakistan's military government
filed another tax evasion case against deposed Prime Minister Nawaz
Sharif on Saturday, accusing him of failing to declare the income
to buy property worth millions of dollars, court officials said.
</P>
<P>
   Sharif's father, Mian Mohammed Sharif and his mother, Shamim
Akther, have also been charged with tax evasion in connection with
the same land purchase. The charges were laid by Pakistan's
National Accountability Bureau, which is investigating corruption
cases against scores of the country's most powerful people,
including politicians and businessmen.
</P>
<P>
   The special accountability court hearing Sharif's corruption and
tax evasion cases has been set up in the 16th century Attock Fort,
60 miles east of the capital Islamabad.
</P>
<P>
   Also at Attock Fort on Saturday, former southern Sindh
provincial minister Farooq Sattar was found guilty of corruption
and sentenced to 14 years in jail. He is expected to appeal. He
also was fined $900,000 and disqualified from holding public office
for 21 years, the maximum penalty under the law.
</P>
<P>
   Sharif is currently serving two concurrent life terms on charges
of terrorism and hijacking. He is appealing the convictions and
sentence. He also faces corruption charges.
</P>
<P>
   Sharif's wife, Kulsoom, has fiercely defended her husband's
innocence.
</P>
<P>
   ''It is another cooked up case filed by the military rulers
against our family,'' Mrs. Sharif said in a telephone interview.
''We will pass through these trying times with our heads held
high.''
</P>
<P>
   According to the latest tax evasion charge, Sharif bought and
developed a 450-acre estate in Raiwind, 15 miles west of Lahore.
The project was valued at $4.6 million, but Sharif did not declare
that money and the estate was purchased in Sharif's mother's name.
</P>
<P>
   The maximum sentence if found guilty is 14 years in jail. Sharif
also would be disqualified from holding a public office.
</P>
<P>
   Army chief Gen. Pervez Musharraf overthrew Sharif's civilian
government in a bloodless coup on Oct. 12, accusing Sharif of
massive corruption, undermining the constitution and destroying
institutions.

<HEADLINE> NTSB: Mechanical problem, medication caused Newark plane crash  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	   NEWARK, N.J. (AP) - Federal investigators have concluded that
mechanical trouble, coupled with the pilot's use of a painkiller,
caused a plane crash that killed four people last November.
</P>
<P>
   The National Transportation Safety Board's final report on the
Nov. 26 crash closely mirrored preliminary results issued in June:
that the pilot, Itzhak Jacoby, was taking fiorinal, a barbituate
known to cause drowsiness and dizziness. Jacoby had a history of
migraine headaches and was using the painkiller for them.
</P>
<P>
   The final report also found evidence that two of the small
plane's three gyroscopes weren't functioning properly. The spinning
devices are crucial to enabling a pilot to determine if a plane is
flying level.
</P>
<P>
   Jacoby, his wife, Gail, and their 13-year-old daughter, Atira,
all from Maryland, died in the crash. A man injured on the ground,
Alfred Walker, of Newark, died eight weeks after the crash from
injuries he sustained in it.
</P>
<P>
   Jacoby, 56, had reported gyroscope problems on the Beechcraft
Bonanza S35 before crashing.
</P>
<P>
   Experts said failed gyroscopes could have doomed the flight that
crashed into a factory and barreled down a street, shedding its
wings and tail before hitting a Kentucky Fried Chicken restaurant.
Twenty-five people were injured on the ground; the plane caused
more than $1 million in property damage.

<HEADLINE> Viking Ship To Recreate Discovery  </HEADLINE>
By CHRISTIAN WIENBERG
<TEXT>
<P>
   COPENHAGEN, Denmark (AP) -- Denmark's royal couple watched
Saturday as Inuit kayaks escorted a Viking ship scheduled to
retrace Leif Eriksson's discovery voyage to North America to its
starting point in southern Greenland.
</P>
<P>
   The arrival of the Islendingur -- the Icelander -- in the tiny
village of Brattahlid, 250 miles south of Greenland's capital,
Nuuk, kicked off a three-day festival celebrating the 1,000-year
anniversary of Eriksson's voyage.
</P>
<P>
   Eleven Inuits in kayaks followed the ship the last few miles up
a fjord and rolled their vessels to the thrill of more than 1,000
spectators, including Denmark's Queen Margrethe and her husband,
Prince Henrik.
</P>
<P>
   ''We welcome you and praise your valor and courage,'' Iceland's
president Olafur Ragnar Grimsson told the nine-man crew upon their
arrival in Brattahlid, which normally has a population of 60.
</P>
<P>
   The 75-foot Viking ship left Iceland a month ago from the site
where the Viking explorer was believed to have lived before he
moved to Brattahlid, the starting point of his historic expedition.
</P>
<P>
   ''The journey from Iceland to Greenland made the crew reflect on
the great accomplishments that marked sea voyages and discoveries
in the Viking Age,'' said skipper Gunnar Marel Eggertson, who along
with the rest of the crew was dressed in traditional Viking
clothing.
</P>
<P>
   They'll have five days to rest and gather fresh supplies before
beginning their voyage to Canada and New England on Thursday. Their
first planned stop in North America was L'Anse aux Meadows,
Newfoundland, the site of North America's only Viking camp, which
was excavated in the 1960s.
</P>
<P>
   ''Accept our good wishes and hopes that the old tale of Leif's
accomplishments will bring you luck during your remaining
journey,'' Grimsson said.
</P>
<P>
   Tents were set up, and the hotel, hostel and even the fire
station in the nearby city of Narssarssuaq completely booked to
accommodate the 700 Inuits and 500 foreign guests who have arrived
for the festivities.
</P>
<P>
   The Arctic island is a semiautonomous territory that is part of
Denmark.
</P>
<P>
   The four-month journey will cover some 3,000 miles and make
several stops, including Portsmouth, N.H., Boston and New York,
where the ship will mark the Oct. 5 opening of the Smithsonian
exhibition ''Vikings: The North Atlantic Saga'' at the American
Museum of Natural History.
</P>
<P>
   Eriksson's landing in North America -- or Vinland the Good, as he
named it -- is well recorded in two medieval Icelandic manuscripts,
the ''Saga of Erik the Red'' and the ''Saga of Greenlanders.''
</P>
<P>
   To re-enact the voyage, skipper Eggertson used Norwegian and
Swedish oak and pine to build the ship, a replica of the
well-preserved ninth century Gokstad ship discovered in Norway a
century ago.
</P>
<P>
   One big difference -- a battleship like Islendingur would have
had a crew of 70 in the Viking era, including a double shift of 32
oarsmen for a quick getaway when winds were weak. This time, it
will rely on a motor, although the crew said they haven't had to
use it yet.

   DENVER (AP) -- Oops! Britney Spears has canceled a sold-out show

<P>
   The world-famous venue that has played host to dozens of major

<HEADLINE> Worker Accuses Soul's Grandfather  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   BEECH ISLAND, S.C. (AP) -- A utility worker has accused James
Brown, the 67-year-old Godfather of Soul, of swinging a knife at
him and holding him against his will.
</P>
<P>
   According to police, the worker went to Brown's home to respond
to a complaint that the power was out. After entering an unlocked
security gate, he met Brown, who told him to wait. When Brown
returned, he was carrying a suit and said, ''That means I'm a
government agent, and I can lock you up for trespassing and
sneaking around on my property.'' Brown then allegedly approached
the worker with a steak knife.
</P>
<P>
   The utility company said there was nothing wrong with Brown's
electricity and they didn't know who called in the complaint.
</P>
<P>
   Brown, whose hits include ''I Got You (I Feel Good),'' and
''Papa's Got a Brand New Bag,'' served a sentence for assault and
weapons convictions from 1988 to 1991. In 1998, he completed a
90-day drug treatment program to avoid a two-year prison sentence
on marijuana and gun charges. Brown said he used the marijuana for
medicinal purposes to treat eye ailments.
</P>
<P>
   Brown's attorney said he had not heard about the latest
allegations and refused comment.

<HEADLINE> US, Mexico Probe Border Report  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN DIEGO, Calif. (AP) -- U.S. and Mexican officials are
investigating a report that Border Patrol agents crossed into
Mexico to capture suspected illegal immigrants.
</P>
<P>
   ''This was not accidental. This was intentional,'' said Rita
Vargas Torregrosa, the Mexican consul in the border town of
Calexico. ''Things are very irregular in this case.''
</P>
<P>
   Mexican officials quoted witnesses as reporting the border
incursion by two agents, and Vargas said more than a dozen people
saw it.
</P>
<P>
   Border Patrol agents met on Friday with Mexican consular
officials and representatives of a Mexican border crime task force,
Border Patrol spokesman Manuel Figueroa said.
</P>
<P>
   The incident allegedly occurred on Thursday eight miles east of
the Calexico border crossing, Figueroa said. He said the
allegations are under investigation.
</P>
<P>
   ''Some people were arrested. Apparently, someone's claiming they
were arrested in Mexico,'' he said. ''The agents felt they were in
the United States.''
</P>
<P>
   The four were released the same day and voluntarily returned to
Mexico, Figueroa said.
</P>
<P>
   Vargas said one of the Border Patrol agents crossed the border
but didn't go far. ''The other entered a kilometer into Mexican
territory pursuing a group of seven migrants,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   The area lacks a border fence and the border markers there are
miles apart, Figueroa said.
</P>
<P>
   Vargas said the All-American Canal is an obvious border marker,
but Figueroa said the canal only loosely follows the border and is
up to a mile north of the boundary in places.
</P>
<P>
   Border conflicts have been a chronic problem.
</P>
<P>
   In April, Mexican soldiers and U.S. police briefly faced off
with weapons drawn inside a flood control tunnel connecting
Nogales, Mexico, and Nogales, Ariz. The Mexican soldiers were on an
anti-drug mission and accidentally crossed about 6 feet into U.S.
territory, Mexican officials said.
</P>
<P>
   In March, two Mexican army trucks crossed into U.S. territory in
a remote area south of Santa Teresa, N.M., and soldiers fired at
Border Patrol agents. Mexican officials said the soldiers were on a
drug-enforcement mission and did not realize they had crossed the
border.

<HEADLINE> Shelby Lynne Returns With New Sound  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   MOBILE, Ala. (AP) -- In 1991, Shelby Lynne was supposed to be the
next big thing in country music. By the time she was 22, she had
recorded a duet with George Jones and won a top country music
award.
</P>
<P>
   But formula-fitting country music didn't suit Lynne, who earned
a reputation for being talented but temperamental. And after five
albums she abandoned Nashville.
</P>
<P>
   Now she's back with her own sound, derived from her roots in
south Alabama.
</P>
<P>
   ''I make music for myself, because I am the listener and I want
to hear what I like,'' said Lynne, now 31. ''It's not fluffy, it's
real. I want something that moves me.''
</P>
<P>
   Lynne recorded the duet ''If I Could Bottle This Up'' with
George Jones in 1998. She won the Academy of Country Music's
Horizon Award for Best New Female Artist in 1991.
</P>
<P>
   ''I knew I'd play music, even if it was just in the Holiday Inn.
I am music. I have to play music.''

<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES (AP) -- Yabba dabba doo! The father of ''The
Flintstones'' is 90.
</P>
<P>
   William Hanna, half of the Hanna-Barbera production team that
created dozens of beloved TV cartoon series, including the story of
''the modern Stone Age family,'' was honored at a studio birthday
party Friday.
</P>
<P>
   As co-chairman of Hanna-Barbera, he still works daily at the
office, said his assistant Edgar Bravo.
</P>
<P>
   Hanna was a college dropout from New Mexico when he began
working as an animator in 1930. He met Joseph Barbera in the late
'30s and they went on to create the ''Tom and Jerry'' cartoons.
</P>
<P>
   The two founded Hanna-Barbera Productions in 1957. The studio,
now owned by Warner Bros., is identified with shows such as ''The
Flintstones,'' ''The Jetsons'' and ''The Smurfs.''
</P>
<P>
   Hanna-Barbera developed hundreds of original characters,
including Fred Flintstone, Huckleberry Hound, Yogi Bear, Atom Ant
and the marble-mouthed dog Scooby-Doo.

   THURMONT, Md. (AP) -- President Clinton, Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak
and Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat engaged with their delegations in informal
talks at the Mideast summit today as some delegates toured the Gettysburg
battlefield. ''The teams continued to meet informally and at times that involved
the leaders,'' said a White House spokesman who spoke on the condition of

leaders, he said. Secretary of State Madeleine Albright was also involved in the

   TEHRAN, Iran (AP) -- Iran test-fired the Shahab-3 missile Saturday, Tehran

said the test was in line with Iran's ''policy of strengthening its defense
capability on the basis of the principle of deterrence.'' In Israel, Deputy
Defense Minister Ephraim Sneh expressed concern Saturday about the missile test
''because Iran actively and relentlessly undermines the peace process through
various terrorist organizations.''

observers, of various nationalities, were flown safely by British military

allegations in the $675 million wrongful death lawsuit brought by survivors of

<HEADLINE> Clinton, Barak, Arafat Meet  </HEADLINE>
By LAURA KING
<TEXT>
<P>
   THURMONT, Md. (AP) -- President Clinton, Israeli Prime Minister
Ehud Barak and Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat engaged with their
delegations in informal talks at the Mideast summit Saturday as
some delegates toured the Gettysburg battlefield.
</P>
<P>
   ''The teams continued to meet informally and at times that
involved the leaders,'' said a White House spokesman who spoke on
the condition of anonymity.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike a meeting Friday night, there was no three-way meeting
between the leaders, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Secretary of State Madeleine Albright was also involved in the
latest round of activity and a more formal meeting was planned
Saturday evening after the close of the Jewish sabbath, the
spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
   Some 15 members of the Israeli and Palestinian delegations took
advantage of a standing offer and toured the battlefield near
Gettysburg, site of the July 1863 bloody engagement generally
considered the Civil War's turning point.
</P>
<P>
   The three leaders met together for just the second time Friday
night following a dinner in a rustic Camp David cabin.
</P>
<P>
   The 90-minute session, which ended early Saturday, was disclosed
later in the morning by the White House. The three leaders had met
when the summit opened on Tuesday. Since then, Clinton has shuttled
between the two sides in talks described as contentious and
difficult.
</P>
<P>
   The leaders were joined only by interpreters and note-takers.
Earlier, Barak was the host at a Sabbath dinner attended by
delegation members.
</P>
<P>
   Mindful of the Jewish day of rest, negotiators kept to a slower
pace Saturday. The Sabbath lasts from sundown Friday until sundown
Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   At the original Camp David summit in 1978, when President Jimmy
Carter guided Israel and Egypt to a peace breakthrough, then-Prime
Minister Menachem Begin solicited a rabbinical opinion that still
holds today: It is permissible for Israeli delegates to talk peace
on the Sabbath if it does not involve work such as note-taking or
use of mechanical devices such as the golf carts that are the
preferred way to get around.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton met Saturday morning with his own negotiating team at
the presidential retreat in Maryland's Catoctin mountains 90 miles
northwest of Washington. There was no immediate word on other talks
taking place during the day.
</P>
<P>
   Participants have agreed to disclose nothing of the substance of
the negotiations, but U.S. officials briefing reporters have
repeatedly used words like ''grappling'' and ''struggling'' to
characterize the atmosphere. At one point, White House spokesman
Joe Lockhart described the issues as ''intractable.''
</P>
<P>
   The two sides are deeply divided on key questions including the
boundaries of any future Palestinian state, the fate of several
million Palestinian refugees and status of Jerusalem, which both
sides claim as their capital.
</P>
<P>
   While the negotiators went about their task, Palestinian
demonstrators took to the streets in the West Bank and Gaza Strip,
urging Arafat to stand firm. Israeli peace activists also gathered
in the Jerusalem suburb of Abu Dis to urge that Palestinians be
given a foothold in Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
   Some of the Palestinian demonstrators made thinly veiled threats
of violence should the summit fail.
</P>
<P>
   ''We give all our support to Arafat and the negotiators in Camp
David,'' said Shafik Tluly, a member of the leadership of Arafat's
Fatah faction. ''But if the summit fails, we are ready for all
possibilities.''
</P>
<P>
   In the Gaza Strip, Sheik Ahmed Yassin, spiritual leader of the
radical Shiite Muslim group Hamas, told followers that the Camp
David talks were ''a conspiracy to put pressure on Palestinians to
give up their natural rights.''
</P>
<P>
   Hamas opposes any peace with Israel and has staged dozens of
attacks including suicide bombings to try to halt the peace
process.
</P>
<P>
   The length of the summit is still uncertain. Clinton is
scheduled to travel to Japan on Wednesday, but U.S. officials have
said that should not be considered a deadline for wrapping up the
peace talks.

<HEADLINE> Tempers Boil in Reds-Rockies Game  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   DENVER (AP) -- Three days worth of tension spilled over Saturday
as the Cincinnati Reds and Colorado Rockies scuffled in the seventh
inning of their series finale.
</P>
<P>
   Reds reliever Scott Sullivan touched off the brawl when he hit
Brian Hunter in the shoulder minutes after Ken Griffey Jr. was
plunked in the thigh by former Cincinnati right-hander Stan
Belinda.
</P>
<P>
   Hunter swung wildly at Sullivan when they met halfway between
the mound and home plate, and the two were quickly engulfed by
their teammates as Sullivan tried to get the upper hand.
</P>
<P>
   The origin of the fight dated to Thursday night when Griffey was
hit in the back and Colorado star Larry Walker was hit three
innings later. Walker played peacemaker Saturday by restraining
Griffey and Sean Casey.
</P>
<P>
   The fighting lasted less than two minutes and Sullivan, Hunter,
Colorado first baseman Todd Helton and Rockies manager Buddy Bell
were ejected.
</P>
<P>
   Cincinnati manager Jack McKeon motioned for his players to leave
the field while the umpires sorted out the mess, but the Reds never
made it to the dugout before returning.

<HEADLINE> Immunity Helped Turn Waco Trial  </HEADLINE>
By SUZANNE GAMBOA
<TEXT>
<P>
   WACO, Texas (AP) -- Long before an advisory jury decided the
federal government was not responsible for the deaths of Branch
Davidians in the Waco siege, U.S. attorneys had turned the case in
their favor.
</P>
<P>
   By invoking a federal law known as the discretionary function
exemption, they eliminated several allegations in the $675 million
wrongful death lawsuit brought by survivors of the 1993 siege and
relatives of those who died. That exemption gives federal officials
room to make judgment calls and carry them out without fear of
being sued, even if their decisions prove to be bad.
</P>
<P>
   ''Even before we got to trial, the case was whittled down
significantly to relatively narrow legal issues, in large part
because a lot of the things we did are protected by the nature of
discretionary function,'' said Thom Mrozek, a Department of Justice
spokesman.
</P>
<P>
   ''The discretionary function exemption ... was designed to allow
federal officials to exercise their best judgment in carrying out
their responsibilities in matters involving the public interest --
without exposing taxpayers to liability for their choices,'' said
Marie Hagan, who helped defend the government in the Davidian case.
</P>
<P>
   On Friday, a five-member jury decided the government did not use
excessive force in its attempt to serve search and arrest warrants
on Branch Davidian leader David Koresh on Feb. 28, 1993. A gun
battle broke out and four Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms
agents as well as six Davidians were killed.
</P>
<P>
   Jurors also decided the government's actions on April 19, 1993,
the final day of the siege, were not negligent and did not
contribute to the deaths of about 80 sect members. The government
said suicidal sect members started fires in the building and were
responsible for their own deaths.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. District Judge Walter Smith doesn't have to follow the
jury's advice. He will make his final ruling after he considers
whether federal agents shot at the Davidians at the end of the
siege.
</P>
<P>
   The plaintiffs say they don't expect him to deviate much from
the jury. One Davidian leader on Saturday was already discussing an
appeal.
</P>
<P>
   ''The government would like to think we've had our day in court
and it's over. But you can't prove your point if you can't present
your point,'' said Clive Doyle, a survivor of the siege who was
part of the lawsuit against the government.
</P>
<P>
   He joined about a dozen Davidians for Bible study Saturday in
the small chapel built on the site where the sect's compound, known
as Mount Carmel, burned to the ground.
</P>
<P>
   ''This is not the end of this,'' said Koresh's mother, Bonnie
Haldeman. ''We're not going to let it be forgotten.''
</P>
<P>
   Federal attorneys convinced Smith last year that the FBI's
decision to tear gas the compound on April 19 to force the
Davidians out was a discretionary function. Also taken out of
consideration were tactics used during the standoff to persuade
Davidians to surrender, such as turning off the electricity and
playing loud music.
</P>
<P>
   Even with such absolution, the case got a full airing, said U.S.
Attorney Mike Bradford.
</P>
<P>
   ''Discretionary function played a role,'' Bradford said. ''But
most issues went to the jury and judge. It was fairly tried and the
judge let all the other issues go to the jury.''
</P>
<P>
   Lead plaintiffs' attorney Michael Caddell disagreed: ''There was
a lot of evidence we didn't get to present.''
</P>
<P>
   Originally, the federal government was nearly untouchable in
liability suits. The concept that the government could do no wrong
-- sovereign immunity -- was a holdover from English law when kings
were considered infallible.
</P>
<P>
   Congress changed that in 1946.
</P>
<P>
   ''They realized they needed a way to end immunity, but not end
it so broadly that all the money was used to pay claims,'' said
Victor Schwartz, a partner at Crowell &AMP; Moring in Washington, D.C.
</P>
<P>
   Baylor University professor Bill Underwood said the jurors'
decision in the Waco trial was significant even though some aspects
were never presented to the panel.
</P>
<P>
   ''It is hard to sue the federal government,'' Underwood said.
''But understand, while the government has the right to be wrong,
if the government fails to exercise reasonable care in executing
policy it can be held liable.''
</P>
<P>
   The discretionary function privilege ''left the plaintiffs with
plenty of room to challenge the government's conduct,'' Underwood
said. ''Given that latitude, it's significant that the government
was vindicated.''

<HEADLINE> Roberts Leads Milwaukee Open  </HEADLINE>
By GREG BEACHAM
<TEXT>
<P>
   MILWAUKEE (AP) -- While most of golf's top players cool their
heels in Scotland, Loren Roberts is spending the weekend destroying
Brown Deer Park again.
</P>
<P>
   With solid drives, several outstanding putts and one spectacular
eagle, Roberts shot an 8-under-par 63 on Saturday to take the lead
into the final round of the Greater Milwaukee Open.
</P>
<P>
   A three-day score of 194 put Roberts 19 shots under par and tied
the tournament record for 54 holes. He held a two-stroke lead over
Franklin Langham and a four-stroke margin over Frank Lickliter.
</P>
<P>
   Roberts has won more than $500,000 in 17 previous trips to
Milwaukee, and he bookended his 1996 title with runner-up finishes
in 1995 and 1997. Afterward, Roberts wore the self-conscious smile
of a player too modest to admit he's at the top of his game.
</P>
<P>
   ''It was a fun day,'' Roberts said. ''I holed some long putts,
made some big shots. I hit a couple of poor shots, but still did
pretty well even with those shots.''
</P>
<P>
   Langham (196) eagled the 18th hole to halve Roberts' lead and
finish with a 64. Lickliter (198) led much of the day but bogeyed
two of his last four holes to finish with a 67.
</P>
<P>
   Roberts, who shared the lead with Lickliter at 11 under after 36
holes, matched Jesper Parnevik's 1996 GMO record for the lowest
54-hole score. On Sunday, he'll go after Carlos Franco's 1999
record final score of 20 under.
</P>
<P>
   ''If I can shoot 5 under tomorrow, that should probably take
care of itself,'' Roberts said.
</P>
<P>
   When the GMO was moved last year to the week before the British
Open, Roberts never considered canceling his annual trip to
Wisconsin for the sake of extra practice for the major. His reasons
were obvious on Saturday at Brown Deer Park, a course he said
perfectly suits his game.
</P>
<P>
   From the 160-yard approach shot that bounced once on the green
and went straight in the hole for an eagle on No. 13, to the
45-foot putt that banged hard off the back lip of the cup but
dropped in on No. 14, Roberts was rolling.
</P>
<P>
   His 63 was two strokes off the GMO single-round record of 61,
set last year by Steve Lowery.
</P>
<P>
   ''Loren can roll his ball,'' Lickliter said. ''He made some
bombs today.''
</P>
<P>
   Roberts got most of the support from a raucous gallery that
followed the three leaders around Brown Deer Park. They put on a
show worth watching: as the day's final grouping, Roberts, Langham
and Lickliter combined to shoot 19-under-par on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   ''There was a lot of whooping and hollering out there,'' Roberts
said. ''That was great. It was nice to feel like I had some
hometown support. It's nice to interact with the fans.''
</P>
<P>
   They'll play together again on Sunday, when Roberts will try for
his first victory since last year's Byron Nelson Classic.
</P>
<P>
   An eagle on the par-4 13th hole was the highlight of Roberts'
round. His 160-foot approach shot bounced on the green and leaped
into the cup without even rattling the flagstick, prompting a
raucous cheer from the large gallery following the 1996 GMO
champion around the course.
</P>
<P>
   The gallery also cheered Langham, who moved to 17 under for the
tournament with a six-birdie, no-bogey round and cut Roberts' lead
from four strokes to two with a 25-foot eagle putt on 18. He said
Brown Deer's generous playing conditions meant only aggressive
players will contend for the title.
</P>
<P>
   ''Even four shots back, I would have felt like I had a chance on
Sunday,'' Langham said. ''There are some birdies out there to be
made.''
</P>
<P>
   While Langham admitted to a bit of gawking at Roberts' play --
particularly the eagle -- Lickliter said he tried to ignore the
distractions. Like Langham, Lickliter is looking for his first tour
victory.
</P>
<P>
   ''For someone to pass (Roberts), it could take a 62 or a 63,''
Lickliter said. ''That's something possible out here.''
</P>
<P>
   Joey Gullion, seven strokes off the lead entering the day,
matched Roberts' 63 and moved into a four-way tie for sixth place.
He had just one birdie, one eagle and seven pars on his first nine
holes, but hit five birdies on the next nine and just missed
another on his last hole when a 10-foot putt lipped out.
</P>
<P>
   Corey Pavin, the 1995 U.S. Open champion Roberts described as
his own ''sentimental favorite'' to win the GMO, shot a third-round
69, putting him in 10th place.

<HEADLINE> Small group commemorate 10 airmen killed in bomber crash 56 years ago </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	   BERLIN, N.H. (AP) - Fifty-six years after 10 airmen died when
their B-17 bomber crashed into a Maine mountain, a small group of
New Hampshire residents did something no one else ever bothered to
do: they commemorated the site.
</P>
<P>
   The men from Berlin, Gorham and Errol gather Saturday near the
hamlet of Wilson's Mills in the unincorporated Maine township of
Cupsuptic and dedicated a 600-pound granite monument.
</P>
<P>
   ''I heard about the crash years ago from an old logger,'' Mike
Rozek of Berlin told columnist John Clayton of The Union Leader of
Manchester. ''I figured if nobody else was going to do anything,
then I would.''
</P>
<P>
   Rozek had no ties to any of the men killed in the crash. But he
was touched by the fact nothing had ever been done to mark the site
and commemorate the airmen's sacrifice.
</P>
<P>
   ''To me, it was just a real sad state of affairs. I know that
life goes on and everyone's too busy to stop. Well, I stopped,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   Rozek first asked Donald Piper, owner of Nicoletti Memorials in
Berlin, about creating a permanent monument at the crash site.
Piper quickly offered to donate a 600-pound granite slab.
</P>
<P>
   ''I had no idea about the history or the tragedy until Mike
brought it to light for me,'' Piper said. ''He felt strongly there
should be something there to identify what happened at that
location and I agreed. The only reason I got interested was because
of his enthusiasm.''
</P>
<P>
   At the request of northern New Hampshire historian Richard
Pinette request, the owners of the land, the Mead Corp., gave
permission for the monument to be installed.
</P>
<P>
   Lucien Dupuis, commander of VFW Post 2520 in Berlin, volunteered
an honor guard for the ceremony and Lionel Roy agreed to sing at
the dedication.
</P>
<P>
   Pinette also wrote to Secretary of Defense William Cohen seeking
financial support. But that request was denied.
</P>
<P>
   Members of the Berlin-Gorham Rotary Club instead donated money
to pay for engraving the names of the 10 airmen onto the monument,
along with the following words:
</P>
<P>
   This W.W. II Memorial is dedicated to the crew of B-17G
43-38023, which crashed here on July 11, 1944. They gave their
lives for their country.''
</P>
<P>
   The 10 were: 2nd Lt. John T. Cast, pilot, Springfield, Ohio; 2nd
Lt. John W. Drake, co-pilot, Port Arthur, Texas; 2nd Lt. William H.
Hudgens, navigator, Flagstaff, Ariz.; 2nd Lt. Robert S. Talley,
bombardier, San Angelo, Texas; S/Sgt. Wayne D. McCavran, engineer,
Seymour, Iowa; Sgt. Cecil Murphy, radio operator, Fall City, Neb.;
Sgt. Clarence M. Wain, gunner, Ten Sleep, Wyo.; Sgt. Gerald V.
Biddle, gunner, East Orange, N.J.; Sgt. James A. Benson,
armorer-gunner, Clark, S.D.; Cpl. John H. Jones Jr. gunner,
Buffalo, N.Y.
</P>
<P>
   The bomber had left Kearney, Neb., bound for England by way of
Bangor, Maine. As it flew over New Hampshire, Murphy made radio
contact with Grenier Field in Manchester at 10:55 a.m. That was the
last anyone heard from the bomber.
</P>
<P>
   Later, it was learned the plane had slammed into a ridge near
the top of Deer Mountain in the remote Maine wilderness at 200
miles per hour. There were no survivors.
</P>
<P>
   The largest piece of the plane found was a 3&AMP;frac12;-foot section of
wing. Salvage teams recovered so little that in time, the military
ordered in a bulldozer, and after removing the live ammunition, the
shards of the once-mammoth fuselage were simply plowed under.
</P>
<P>
   Rozek, 44, born 12 years after the crash, learned of it one day
during a conversation with a man who once logged in the area.
</P>
<P>
   ''I wanted to know more,'' Rozek said.
</P>
<P>
   Rozek thought about it for years, all the time trying to find
out more details. Then in 1995, thousands of military documents
were declassified, and he got his hands on the official report
filed July 22, 1944.
</P>
<P>
   While the body of the co-pilot, Drake, was officially
identified, other remains were hard to come by.
</P>
<P>
   Then Rozek decided something had to be done after talking to Don
Glover, who lives in the area.
</P>
<P>
   ''He told me one day a cousin of one of the men who died went to
the site,'' Rozek said. ''As far as he was concerned, that's where
his cousin is buried and he was devastated that there was nothing
to mark it.''

<HEADLINE> Homeless Man Collects Inheritance  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   SULPHUR SPRINGS, Ohio (AP) -- A homeless man who has lived on the
street for 20 years and didn't even know his father had died
arrived Saturday in Ohio to collect part of an inheritance on an
estate worth $110,000.
</P>
<P>
   Steven Kent spent the better part of two decades scrounging for
empty cans to support his drinking habit in Long Beach, Calif. For
14 years, he had been out of touch with his sister, Bonnie White,
who reported him missing in January because she wanted to settle
the estate of their father, who died in October 1998.
</P>
<P>
   A bicycle patrolman who had cited Kent about 75 times for minor
offenses finally tracked him down in an alley where he was known to
sleep, and on Wednesday, he began the bus trip to Ohio.
</P>
<P>
   White met Kent at the bus station Saturday and drove him to
their childhood home where she still lives in this small town about
60 miles northwest of Columbus.
</P>
<P>
   ''It is nice seeing her again ... I missed her,'' Kent said.
''We talked about old times and how she has been fixing up the
place.''
</P>
<P>
   The estate of their father, Dewey Kent Jr., has an estimated
value of more than $110,000, records show. White and Kent are the
only heirs.
</P>
<P>
   The two plan to settle the estate Monday, but White said the
first priority is seeing her brother.
</P>
<P>
   ''It never was about the money,'' she said. ''It has been two
years and I just wanted closure.''
</P>
<P>
   Kent, 45, said he plans to stay at the family home in Sulphur
Springs and later look for a place of his own. He said he doesn't
have any other plans yet for his half of the inheritance, but
added, ''I will probably put it into a bank.''

<HEADLINE> Pacers' Owner Denies Thomas Rumor  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   INDIANAPOLIS (AP) -- Pacers president Donnie Walsh denied
coaching candidate Isiah Thomas is using money from a contract with
the Pacers to pay off a $750,000 debt to former owners of the
Continental Basketball Association.
</P>
<P>
   ''There is no contract,'' Walsh said Friday. ''Nothing is signed
and sealed yet. He's not using any money that we have given him. In
other words, we have not given him any money.''
</P>
<P>
   Thomas, a Hall of Fame member, is one of two acknowledged
candidates to replace Larry Bird as Pacers coach, along with Pacers
assistant Rick Carlisle.
</P>
<P>
   But Thomas, who purchased the CBA in October for $10 million,
must sell it before taking an NBA job. Thomas has signed a letter
of agreement with the NBA players' union to explore the sale of the
league to the group.
</P>
<P>
   Jay Frye, former managing partner of the CBA's Fort Wayne Fury,
said that certified checks to former CBA owners were supposed to be
in the mail Friday.
</P>
<P>
   ''Isiah's people have told us on a couple of occasions that his
deal with the Pacers is done and signed and they're going to use it
to pay us off and sell the league to the players' association,''
said Frye, the former chairman of the CBA executive committee. ''I
hope he gets a job so he can pay his bills.''
</P>
<P>
   When he spoke in Gary, Ind., on Friday, Thomas indicated the job
wasn't yet his. He visited the city to announce the coaching staff
for the Gary Steelheads CBA expansion franchise.
</P>
<P>
   ''I'll wait for the Pacers to make a decision. Until they make a
decision, I'll continue operating the business,'' Thomas said.
</P>
<P>
   Frye said if he's not paid soon, he'll file a lawsuit against
Thomas.
</P>
<P>
   ''I have no tolerance for him passing deadlines anymore,'' Frye
said.
</P>
<P>
   Walsh said he plans to ask the NBA to waive Thomas' ownership in
the CBA.
</P>
<P>
   ''We have to know that before we get to anything else,'' Walsh
said.

<HEADLINE> American Record Holder Stunned  </HEADLINE>
By BOB BAUM
<TEXT>
<P>
   SACRAMENTO, Calif. (AP) -- For a track and field athlete in this
country, it is the ultimate nightmare.
</P>
<P>
   Jeff Hartwig, who just a month ago vaulted higher than anyone in
the world this year, an American record of 19 feet, 9&AMP;frac14; inches,
couldn't clear the opening height of 18-2&AMP;frac12; in three tries in the
U.S. Olympic Trials.
</P>
<P>
   In the do-or-die competition to determine who makes the U.S.
Olympic team, it was a catastrophe. The Olympics, the goal he had
been aiming at for so long, would go on without him.
</P>
<P>
   ''I can't put into words how bad I feel,'' Hartwig said
Saturday, less than 24 hours after he knocked down the bar on his
third and final try. ''I slept 2&AMP;frac12; hours last night. It's a big
disappointment because I worked so hard for four years. But I'll go
on. The sun wasn't up when I got up this morning, but it did come
up.''
</P>
<P>
   Hartwig, 32, from Jonesboro, Ark., said that blurred vision,
compounded by problems with the spacing of his steps as he
approached the vault pit, caused his failure.
</P>
<P>
   He said he long has had problems with his contact lenses drying
up, especially in indoor meets, and that was the case in the dry
conditions on the track Friday.
</P>
<P>
   ''I've got like four different kinds of drops that I carry with
me,'' Hartwig said. ''They do a pretty good job of lubricating, but
I think sometimes those lubricating solutions are a little gummy or
something. Every so often, especially on a dry day where I have to
put more drops in, it seems to affect my depth perception a little
bit.''
</P>
<P>
   Depth perception is crucial for a pole vaulter as he tries to
firmly plant the base of the pole in the box to begin his jump.
</P>
<P>
   ''There were certain things he had to do,'' said Hartwig's
coach, former world record-holder Earl Bell. ''He had to be
aggressive, but he couldn't do it. Depth perception was making it
tough for him to hit the box hard. It's like a breaker switch. You
have to see what you're doing.''
</P>
<P>
   To help remedy the problem, Hartwig plans to have laser eye
surgery to correct his vision problems at the end of this year.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike other events, a pole vaulter can't coast through the
qualifying rounds. That's why this event seems to feature more
pratfalls than most. For instance, the great Sergey Bubka didn't
make an opening height in the 1992 Olympic finals.
</P>
<P>
   ''Everytime you step on the runway in the pole vault, because
there's so much timing involved, it's pretty much a full 100
percent effort, whether the bar's at 18 feet or 20 feet, or a
qualifying round or a final,'' Hartwig said.
</P>
<P>
   He said he never felt better when he walked onto the track
Friday. In his final warmup jump, he cleared 18 feet by about a
foot. There was no hint of what was to come. He had failed to make
a qualifying height only one other time in the last three years --
last month in Athens, Greece, after a 36-hour flight from Eugene,
Ore.
</P>
<P>
   When he failed on his third attempt, his close friend and fellow
vaulter Nick Hysong was stunned.
</P>
<P>
   ''I was close to tears,'' said Hysong, who did make it to
Sunday's finals. ''It chokes me up. Not having him there, it just
doesn't feel right. It doesn't feel like it's the national
championship or the Olympic Trials final.''
</P>
<P>
   Hartwig said it would be hypocritical for him to suggest the
system for selecting the U.S. team be changed.
</P>
<P>
   He likes the system in Germany, where the team is determined by
performances in several meets and other factors but, he said, ''I
feel if I deserve a spot on the Olympic team and possibly go get a
medal, how am I going to beat all the best guys in the world if I
can't finish in the top three among the Americans?''
</P>
<P>
   Hartwig, who says he ''lives and breathes pole vaulting. It's
all I do,'' plans to go back to Europe and compete for a Grand Prix
title. He'll be nearly 37 when the next Olympics comes, and he
knows that might be too old to make the team.
</P>
<P>
   ''I'm feeling very healthy and I feel I'm able to jump very
high,'' he said. ''That's what makes this the most disappointing. I
felt this was my year. Everything had gone perfectly. I'm going to
go to Europe and try to redeem myself a little bit, if not anybody
else's eyes, at least in mine.''

<P>
   MILWAUKEE (AP) -- Although Loren Roberts, Franklin Langham and
Frank Lickliter combined to shoot 19-under-par Saturday, the
threesome's outstanding round wasn't without distractions.
</P>
<P>
   Lickliter had an exchange at the 14th hole with a fan who
shouted an unflattering comment about Lickliter's wife. It was the
same hole where he missed a 2-inch tap-in putt Friday.
</P>
<P>
   ''He made a comment, and I wasn't in the mood to let him get
away with it,'' Lickliter said.
</P>
<P>
   ''That was kind of unexpected, because normally the galleries
are wonderful here,'' Roberts said.
</P>
<P>
   The fans who followed the three players were treated to an
exhibition of outstanding golf, with most of the fireworks coming
from Roberts. The GMO's leader went birdie-eagle-birdie on holes
12-14 and received huge cheers.
</P>
<P>
   Milwaukee golf fans find Roberts a sentimental favorite. Playing
in his 18th GMO, the 1996 champion is also the event's career money
leader.
</P>
<P>
   ''It was nice to feel like I had some good hometown support,''
he said.
</P>
<P>
   The three players, who will play together again on Sunday, are
friends off the course as well. Langham spent much of Saturday's
round asking Lickliter about his recent bear hunting trip to Alaska
with Fuzzy Zoeller.
</P>
<P>
   ------
</P>
<P>
   QUICK MOVE: Mathew Goggin, who carded a pair of 68s in the first
two rounds, quickly got to 9 under by making birdies on Nos. 3-5
Saturday morning. His fine play resulted in a 6-under 65, leaving
him at 12-under 201 and tied for sixth place.
</P>
<P>
   Goggin, 26, is from Tasmania, and he won the Australasian Tour
championship in 1998. Three years earlier, he was the Amateur
Player of the Year in Australia. His mother was a three-time
Australasian Amateur champion.
</P>
<P>
   ------
</P>
<P>
   MISSING THE CUT: Conspicuous by his absence for the final two
rounds was Mark Calcavecchia, who missed the cut after shooting
rounds of 67-76.
</P>
<P>
   Calcavecchia, who will play next week in the British Open at St.
Andrews, was playing in his 20th GMO. Calcavecchia's string of 11
straight rounds of 69 or better in the GMO ended in the second
round last year, when he shot 1-under 70.
</P>

   DIVOTS: Steve Pate, who shot a 7-under 64 Friday, didn't waste
any time getting untracked Saturday. He birdied the first two holes
and three of the first four to get to 11 under before finishing the
day at a disappointing 70 and 204 total. ... Ben Bates shot a
9-under 62 to lead after the first round of the 1999 GMO before
finishing in a tie for 10th. On Saturday, he shot a 5-under 30 on
the front nine before finishing with a 66 and a 54-hole total of
205. His front nine featured an eagle 3 on the fourth hole and
birdies on 1, 6 and 7. ... Defending champion Carlos Franco, who
successfully defended his New Orleans title earlier this season,
stumbled to a 73 Saturday, leaving him 15 shots behind Roberts.

<HEADLINE> Canadian Tornado Kills Nine  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   PINE LAKE, Alberta (AP) -- A tornado that tossed trailers into a
lake while devastating a crowded campsite killed nine people, sent
more than 130 to the hospital and forced 400 to spend the night in
temporary shelters, police said Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   Injured campers, some with broken limbs, wandered in shock while
others frantically searched for missing loved ones after the
twister left the Green Acres campground by Pine Lake, about 90
miles north of Calgary.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's like ground zero,'' Royal Canadian Mounted Police
Constable Dan Doyle said. ''It's as though a steamroller had
actually gone through it and flattened it out.''
</P>
<P>
   Divers searched submerged trailers for more victims Saturday,
and police asked the military for help in checking and clearing
wreckage strewn across the hillside campsite and into the lake
water.
</P>
<P>
   Authorities were trying to determine if anyone else staying at
the campsite was missing, a task made difficult by the large
numbers of injured and displaced transported to nearby Red Deer and
as far as Calgary and Edmonton in response to the emergency.
</P>
<P>
   Prime Minister Jean Chretien said in a statement issued in
Ottawa that the tragedy showed the fragility and preciousness of
life.
</P>
<P>
   The tornado touched down at the campground about 6:30 p.m.
Friday and lasted some 20 minutes.
</P>
<P>
   Oliver Mahoney, 32, said the twister picked up his trailer on
the shores of the lake and flipped it like a matchbox, while he and
eight relatives, including his four children, aged 3 to 9,
desperately hung on inside.
</P>
<P>
   ''I told everybody to try to embrace the walls,'' he said.
''They were screaming and yelling. It was terrible. It seemed like
a bad dream. We had to climb to the top to try to get out.''
</P>
<P>
   The nine dead included a 2-year-old child, and 136 were
transported to hospitals in nearby Red Deer as well as Calgary and
Edmonton, police said. Victims with less serious injuries were
treated at the scene, and 400 people were taken to area shelters
for the night.
</P>
<P>
   A search of trailers that were knocked into Pine Lake by the
storm began at dawn and had yielded no new victims by midmorning,
said Cpl. Patrick Webb of the Royal Canadian Mounted Police.
</P>
<P>
   The storm brought hail and harsh winds as it moved across the
lake and touched down at a rural subdivision on the other side.
About a dozen homes there were seriously damaged or ruined.
</P>
<P>
   ''There were hundreds of people walking around with scrapes,
bruises, people being carried out on stretchers,'' Andrew Schultz,
a weather reporter for a Red Deer television station, said of the
campground.
</P>
<P>
   Webb said the campground, located on a hillside by the lake, had
600 spaces and was at the height of its summer season. People rent
spots for the summer and park trailers there that they use on
weekends or when they can get away. While the campground was
''pretty full,'' he said, it wasn't clear how many people were
there when the storm hit.
</P>
<P>
   Newspaper photographer Craig Douce said the campsite looked like
''a bomb went off'' when he arrived 30 minutes after the storm.
</P>
<P>
   ''There were people partially trapped within their mangled motor
homes,'' he said, describing how he saw a man watching as his wife
was cut out of their trailer with a chain saw.
</P>
<P>
   Felicia Cacace told how her trailer suddenly lurched about with
her inside.
</P>
<P>
   ''I was flying up and down,'' she said. ''I held onto the
television, and then we crashed to the ground.''
</P>
<P>
   Mahoney had been on the lake in a motorboat when his wife called
him to come in. They started to tie down their belongings as the
storm kicked up.
</P>
<P>
   Mahoney said he and his family thought they were going to die,
adding: ''There's no time to think. You just do a lot of praying.''
He suffered a broken arm and a cut foot, while his mother was
admitted to the hospital in Red Deer with broken ribs. The rest of
the family was unhurt.
</P>
<P>
   The weather system that created the tornado could be seen from
Calgary, said Blair Morrow of the government agency Environment
Canada. A tornado warning had been issued for the area about the
same time the funnel cloud touched down, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Alberta Premier Ralph Klein was traveling to the scene, said his
assistant, Gordon Turtle.
</P>
<P>
   The storm was one of the worst in Alberta since a 1987 tornado
in Edmonton killed 27 people and injured 300.

<HEADLINE> Sierra Leone Peacekeepers Freed  </HEADLINE>
By CLARENCE ROY-MACAULAY
<TEXT>
<P>
   FREETOWN, Sierra Leone (AP) -- In a rare display of force, U.N.
troops on Saturday launched a rescue mission that freed all 222
peacekeepers and 11 military observers trapped by rebels inside a
U.N. base in eastern Sierra Leone, U.N. officials said.
</P>
<P>
   The operation began about 6 a.m. in Kailahun, about 200 miles
east of Freetown, when helicopters picked up the military
observers. Rebels fired at U.N. troops and British military Chinook
helicopters supporting the mission, said a senior peacekeeping
officer, Indian Maj. Anthanarayan Arun.
</P>
<P>
   The rest of the freed U.N. peacekeepers -- all Indians who had
been unable to leave their base in the rebel headquarters at
Kailahun since May -- faced heavy rebel gunfire Saturday as they
made their way by road toward the U.N. controlled town of Daru.
</P>
<P>
   After 10 hours of slogging through a muddy, cratered, 15-mile
stretch of road under rebel gunfire, the convoy of freed
peacekeepers linked up Saturday evening with a large contingent of
U.N. troops that fought its way up from the south, Arun said. Both
groups were spending the night on the road about 3 miles north of
the rebel-held town of Pendembu.
</P>
<P>
   The rebels suffered ''serious casualties'' and two Indian
peacekeepers had gunshot wounds to the hand and thigh respectively,
Arun added. No one in the aircraft was injured.
</P>
<P>
   British helicopters flew the 11 observers and 29 injured or ill
peacekeepers to Freetown, U.N. spokeswoman Hirut Befecadu said.
</P>
<P>
   Both groups hoped to travel to safety in U.N.-controlled Daru on
Sunday morning with the help of Indian and British military air
support, Arun said.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's great to be back,'' said British Maj. Andrew Harrison,
one of the observers.
</P>
<P>
   The decision to mount a rescue was made after the U.N. force in
Sierra Leone received a distress call from the detainees about
dwindling food and medical supplies, according to a U.N. statement.
The rebels had been adopting an ''increasingly threatening
posture,'' U.N. Secretary General Kofi Annan's spokesman said in a
statement without elaboration.
</P>
<P>
   The rescue came two months after the rebels of the Revolutionary
United Front reignited Sierra Leone's eight-year civil war by
launching attacks on towns and capturing some 500 U.N. hostages.
Those hostages were disarmed, and released after several weeks.
</P>
<P>
   Over the course of the war, the rebels have systematically
killed and maimed tens of thousands of innocent civilians in a bid
to gain power through fear. They have abandoned three different
peace accords.
</P>
<P>
   After arriving in Freetown, Harrison, 33, spoke briefly about a
10-day period of captivity in early May when he was ''maltreated''
by rebels before being allowed to join the Indian contingent in
Kailahun, which had more freedom of movement.
</P>
<P>
   ''We were (initially) maltreated, held in a hut with armed
guards,'' he said without giving details, adding that local
civilians were ''very friendly'' to the captives.
</P>
<P>
   While they had been detained, the 222 peacekeepers still had
their weapons. Over the past two weeks, however, the rebels refused
to allow the U.N. force in Sierra Leone, known as UNAMSIL, to send
them food supplies by road or air.
</P>
<P>
   Recent torrential rains had also limited the detained
peacekeepers' ability to move, the U.N. statement added. The U.N.
soldiers were in a base measuring 500 by 500 yards.
</P>
<P>
   ''The use of force by UNAMSIL to extract its personnel from the
area had become inevitable,'' Annan's spokesman Fred Eckhard said.
The rebels rejected intensive diplomatic and political efforts, he
added, warning the renegades that ''it is in their interest not to
oppose this legitimate (rescue) effort.''
</P>
<P>
   Kailahun, which has served as the rebels' main headquarters
since they launched the war in the early 1990s, is a ravaged town
overtaken by jungle.
</P>
<P>
   The U.N. rescue team consisted of troops from Ghana, India, and
Nigeria, according to a U.N. statement earlier Saturday. U.N. force
commander Indian Maj. Gen. Vijay Jetley was personally overseeing
the mission from a nearby U.N. base in the town of Daru.

<HEADLINE> Kite Leads Senior Players  </HEADLINE>
By HARRY ATKINS
<TEXT>
<P>
   DEARBORN, Mich. (AP) -- Tom Kite, bidding for second major
victory in his first season on the senior circuit, finished the
third round of the Senior Players Championship with a two-stroke
lead over Dana Quigley on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   Kite, who will leave immediately after Sunday's final round for
the British Open, had one bogey in a 5-under-par round of 67 for a
10-under 201 total on the TPC of Michigan. Quigley had a bogey-free
67.
</P>
<P>
   Mike McCullough, playing his 131st straight event, a record on
the senior circuit, birdied the final two holes in a round of 67 to
trail Kite by five strokes in the fourth and final senior major.
</P>
<P>
   Larry Nelson and Ray Floyd were at 207, each with rounds of 69.
</P>
<P>
   Quigley, starting the day at 8 under, two strokes behind
second-round co-leaders Kite and South African Hugh Baiocchi, let
them know early the game was on. Kite responded by matching Quigley
almost shot for shot. Baiocchi, hurt by some shaky iron play,
quickly fell out of contention, shooting a 75 for a 209 total.
</P>
<P>
   Quigley, seeking his second victory of the season, birdied two
of the first four holes on his way to a 3-under 33 on the front
side. But Kite, whose confidence has soared since changing both his
putter and putting stroke two weeks ago, also turned in 33 to
maintain a two-stroke edge.
</P>
<P>
   Kite, wearing a khaki baseball-style cap rather than his
familiar wide-brimmed straw planter's hat in the stiff wind, played
well enough to go even lower but he left birdie putts on the lip at
Nos. 7 and 8.
</P>
<P>
   A freckle-faced boy in the gallery was fighting a case of
hiccups as Kite lined up a seven-foot putt for possible birdie at
the par-3 No. 8. It's doubtful Kite heard, yet he did pull the
putt, leaving it on the left edge of the cup.
</P>
<P>
   Kite came back with a side-hill 30-footer for birdie on No. 9,
which Quigley matched from seven feet.
</P>
<P>
   Quigley hit a superb approach to within four feet of the pin for
birdie at No. 11. But the unflappable Kite matched it by curling in
a 10-footer on the par-3 12th at the 6,966-yard layout designed by
Jack Nicklaus around wetlands near the world headquarters of
sponsoring Ford Motor Co.
</P>
<P>
   A big-breaking 30-footer got Kite to 15 under at the 14th, the
signature hole on this golf course, and opened his lead to three
strokes over Quigley.
</P>
<P>
   It didn't last long.
</P>
<P>
   Kite, using a 5-iron into the teeth of the wind at the par-5
15th, left his tee shot short of the green. His approach rolled
about seven feet beyond the hole, and his putt to save failed. It
was Kite's only bogey, leaving him up by two again.
</P>
<P>
   Kite and Quigley both missed eagle putts on No. 17, a 552-yard
par 5, and settled for their final birdies of the day.
</P>
<P>
   Kite won The Tradition, the first major of the year, in early
April, and also won the SBC Senior Open in June.
</P>
<P>
   Among the other noteables: defending champion Hale Irwin was 5
over on the front nine in a round of 73 for a 209 total. Jack
Nicklaus, who designed the course, had a round of 71 for a 218
total.
</P>
<P>
   The winner will earn $315,000 from the $2.1 million purse.

<HEADLINE> Mall developer gets White House endorsement, gives Gore donation  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) - Vice President Al Gore's presidential campaign
received thousands of dollars in donations from a developer days
after the White House endorsed that company's plans to build a
shopping mall on environmentally sensitive wetlands in New Jersey,
according to a published report.
</P>
<P>
   Mills Corp. wanted to build an upscale shopping complex in
Carlstadt, N.J., but environmentalists opposed it for years because
the construction would mean filling more than 90 acres of
marshland, where rare wildlife can be found.
</P>
<P>
   Because the 8,000 or so acres of the New Jersey Meadowlands,
once the site of unfettered development and garbage dumps, are
primarily wetlands, federal agencies must approve any new
development there. And although the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service
originally opposed Mills' project, it gave its support after
intervention from the White House.
</P>
<P>
   The federal Environmental Protection Agency and other state and
federal offices gave preliminary endorsement to the project April
22. About a week after the endorsement, Mills executives and their
relatives gave at least $31,000 to Gore's campaign, The
Philadelphia Inquirer reported in Saturday's editions.
</P>
<P>
   Mills executives and Gore have denied any connection.
</P>
<P>
   But Jeff Tittle, director of the New Jersey chapter of the
Sierra Club, isn't convinced.
</P>
<P>
   ''This is a good example of special-interest money trying to
influence public policy,'' Tittle said. ''New Jersey needs more
malls like Washington needs more bureaucrats.''
</P>
<P>
   Another environmental group, Friends of the Earth Political
Action Committee, earlier this year reported that executives,
contractors and family members of the Mills Corp. had given Gore
$43,000 for his campaign. The environmental group reported those
numbers after the Clinton-Gore administration expressed support for
a mall by the same company on 500 acres of wetlands in the
Meadowlands. It's not clear if that report is related to The
Inquirer's report on the site in Carlstadt.
</P>
<P>
   Gore's spokesman, Jim Kennedy, denied that the donations
reported in The Inquirer influenced policy.
</P>
<P>
   Kennedy said the White House Council on Environmental Quality,
which is closely affiliated with Gore, tried to resolve the dispute
by working to strike a balance between private property and open
space rights. He said the deal cut the size of the original
proposal in half.
</P>
<P>
   ''There is certainly no connection between anyone's
contributions and the administration's work on the management
plan,'' Kennedy said. ''The White House became involved at the
request of environmentalists and helped fashion a solution which
benefits the environment and in fact bars the Mills Corp. from
building the mall it had planned.''
</P>
<P>
   James Dausch, vice president for development at Mills, said the
company worked for five years to get the necessary approvals.
Dausch also said there was no connection between the decisions and
the contributions.

<P>
   DEARBORN, Mich. (AP) -- Not too many 55-year-old men are willing
to refer to themselves as an infant -- especially with TV cameras
rolling.
</P>
<P>
   But that's just what Mike McCullough did after his 5-under-par
67 in the third round of the Senior Players Championship on
Saturday at the TPC of Michigan.
</P>
<P>
   ''Mike McCullough has been on the golf tour for a long time, but
the Mike McCullough with a new golf swing is only 2&AMP;frac12; years old, and
feels like an infant out there,'' said McCullough, who moved within
five shots of leader Tom Kite. ''It's taken a lot of time to get to
this point, and I'm excited about getting into the last group on
Sunday.''
</P>
<P>
   McCullough has never won in his 28-year career on the PGA Tour
and Senior PGA Tour, but he thinks he's ready to pick up his first
victory.
</P>
<P>
   ''I think I've learned that winning is about patience,'' he
said. ''And knowing that while I will be nervous, so will everyone
else. I've spent a lot of nights trying to tell myself to relax,
but now I realize that I'm not going to relax. You just have to
play smart golf and hope you get some breaks.''
</P>
<P>
   Although he hasn't visited the winner's circle yet, McCullough
is well-known on tour for both his footwear and for being the Lou
Gehrig of the senior circuit. Wearing his distinctive spiked
sandals, he has now played in the last 131 tournaments that he was
eligible for, the longest streak in tour history.
</P>
<P>
   ''I'd love to take some time off and see more of my family, but
I can't do that until I'm fully exempt,'' he said. ''There's a
number in my mind, and when I get to that spot on the money list,
I'll take some time off. As for the sandals, it's simple -- if you
had air conditioning in your car, you would use it, right? That's
what these are -- shoes with air conditioning. I don't understand
why more guys don't wear them.''
</P>
<P>
   ------
</P>
<P>
   JACOBS ACE: John Jacobs briefly got himself back into the
tournament with one swing of his 7-iron. Trailing Kite by three
shots, he aced the 176-yard 8th hole. It was the seventh ace in
Seniors Players history, and the second on the 8th hole. Tom Shaw
did it in 1995, also in the third round. Jacobs couldn't keep the
momentum, though, taking a double-bogey 6 at the 11th. He finished
with a 1-under 71, and trails Kite by eight shots.
</P>
<P>
   ------
</P>
<P>
   SNEAD'S REBOUND: J.C. Snead turned in the first outstanding
round of the day, shooting a 4-under 68 to get to 3 over for the
tournament. Snead, who turns 60 in October, shot a 78 in the first
round, before cutting five shots off for a second-round 73, and
five more in the third.
</P>
<P>
   ------
</P>
<P>
   STREAK ENDS: Tom Watson's 1-over 73 snapped his streak of 21
rounds at par or better. That was the best streak of the season,
but still six rounds short of the tour record, held by three
players. Watson's last over-par round came in the final round of
April's PGA Seniors' Championship.

<P>
   NEW LONDON, Conn. (AP) - Hundreds of thousands were expected to
watch what organizers called the largest fireworks display ever in
New England Saturday night as the grand finale to the four-day
OpSail 2000 festival.
</P>
<P>
   Visitors braved the wind and rain Saturday for their last chance
to catch a glimpse of the tall ships.
</P>
<P>
   The weather threatened to snuff the fireworks display planned.
Organizers said the show would be rescheduled for Sunday if there
was severe lightning or a torrential downpour.
</P>
<P>
   As of Saturday evening, the fireworks show was still planned to
go forward. OpSail spokesman John Fleming said the crowd has been
building and was expected to reach 350,000 to 500,000 for the
fireworks.
</P>
<P>
   Fleming predicted close to 1 million spectators would attend
OpSail by its conclusion.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's been just excellent,'' Fleming said. ''It's just amazing
how well everything came together and how happy everyone seems.''
</P>
<P>
   Roger Vanwey of Gales Ferry was among the spectators who was not
deterred by the rain.
</P>
<P>
   ''We're going to stake our claim,'' Vanwey said. ''We got
umbrellas, tarps and everything else.''
</P>
<P>
   Wendy Sweeney of Niantic also came prepared. ''We did bring a
tent just in case it does rain,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Forty-one ships from the United States, South America and Europe
took part in the event, which organizers hailed as a success for
this historic whaling town. Transportation, stressed by
unexpectedly large crowds on the opening day of the festival, ran
smoothly for the rest of the event and the Coast Guard reported no
serious boating accidents.
</P>
<P>
   The OpSail ships, which have also visited San Juan, Puerto Rico;
Miami; Norfolk, Va.; Baltimore; Philadelphia; and New York, will
head next to Portland, Maine.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, the Amistad - a replica of the 19th-century schooner
whose cargo of African slaves revolted and won their freedom - was
feted in its home port of New Haven.
</P>
<P>
   The Amistad sailed into the harbor after having participated in
OpSail in New York and New London. The vessel was greeted by a
flotilla of other ships and hundreds of drummers and singers,
including members of Boston's Sierra Leone Cultural Organization.
</P>
<P>
   Sierra Leone was the homeland of the 53 Africans who rebelled
aboard the original Amistad in 1839 and were freed after trials in
New Haven and Washington.
</P>
<P>
   When the Amistad docked, it was blessed in a ceremony combining
West African and American traditions.
</P>
<P>
   The two-day festival, featuring a bus tour of New Haven's
historical landmarks and cultural exhibits, will continue Sunday.

   HEBRON, West Bank (AP) -- The Jewish enclave in Hebron was
engulfed for three hours Saturday by rioting and fist fights
between Jews and Arabs, an eruption that could reverberate on the
peace summit in Camp David. Five Palestinians were hospitalized.
</P>
<P>
   Palestinians said the Jewish settlers, known to be the most
adamant opponents of Prime Minister Ehud Barak's peacemaking
efforts, started throwing stones at Palestinians in the afternoon,
accusing them of disturbing their Sabbath rest.
</P>
<P>
   Settlers said the riots started when a Palestinian sexually
assaulted a Jewish teen-age girl. Palestinian officials strongly
denied that, saying it was a pretext for violence by settlers
hoping to scuttle any peace accord.
</P>
<P>
   Jewish settlers have attacked local Palestinians in the past for
disturbing the Sabbath, but the rioting has rarely achieved such an
intensity.
</P>
<P>
   Fist fights drew hundreds of Jews and Palestinians to some of
the most sensitive areas in the city, including near the Cave of
the Patriarchs, the scenes of bloody violence in the past. Israeli
army troops, who are in charge of security in the enclave, grappled
both with the settlers and the Palestinians.
</P>
<P>
   Settlers damaged about dozen Palestinian vehicles. The sides
threw stones and bottles at each other.
</P>
<P>
   David Wilder, a resident of the neighboring settlement of Kiryat
Arba, said a 14-year-old girl from Hebron was walking to Kiryat
Arba to visit friends when she was attacked from behind by a
Palestinian man.
</P>
<P>
   The assailant choked her, molested her, kissed her and threw her
to the ground, and fled only when she started screaming, Wilder
quoted the girl as saying. He would not name her, but a military
official identified her as the daughter of a leader of the Hebron
community.
</P>
<P>
   The girl alerted a number of Kiryat Arba settlers, including
Wilder, who escorted her back to the police station in the Hebron
enclave.
</P>
<P>
   ''There were red marks around her neck from the choking,''
Wilder told The Associated Press. ''We see this as attempted
murder.'' He said a doctor examined a girl, and declared her shaken
but in good health.
</P>
<P>
   The girl waited an hour at the police station to file a
complaint, and went home frustrated. It was then that settlers
began to ''demonstrate,'' Wilder said.
</P>
<P>
   Muhammad Jamal said he was the first to come under attack. He
said he was walking on the road separating Hebron from the
neighboring settlement of Kiryat Arba, when a gang of youths beat
and insulted him.
</P>
<P>
   ''I ran away, and then they started picking on everyone
passing,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   In one incident, five to six Jewish settler men, dressed in
their Sabbath best white shirts and blue slacks, surrounded a
Palestinian man and started punching and kicking him.
</P>
<P>
   Five Palestinians, including cameramen for Reuters television
and TF1, a French network, were hospitalized. Another six,
including a cameraman for ABC TV, were treated on the spot. Troops
arrested five Palestinians and two settlers. One Palestinian was
arrested after shouting ''We will die for our land!''
</P>
<P>
   The army said that a soldier was lightly injured and treated on
the spot.
</P>
<P>
   Settlers advanced on Palestinian areas, prompting Israeli
soldiers to shout, ''Get out of here!''
</P>
<P>
   Order was eventually restored when the troops formed a human
shield between the settlers and the Palestinians.
</P>
<P>
   Hebron has been the repeated scene of Jewish-Arab clashes. The
400 settlers there say the city was willed to the Jews by the
biblical patriarch, Abraham, and are among the hardest-line in the
West Bank.
</P>
<P>
   Among Palestinians, the town is a stronghold of the militant
Islamic Hamas movement, which opposes the peace process. There are
120,000 Palestinians living there, about 30,000 in the enclave
still controlled by the Israelis.
</P>
<P>
   Israeli government attempts to improve living conditions among
the Arabs in the Jewish enclave -- a stipulation of interim pace
accords -- have been stymied by settler violence.
</P>
<P>
   Barak is conferring with Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat at a
U.S.-sponsored summit in Camp David, near Washington. Barak has not
said whether he would give up Hebron, but he says he is willing to
cede settlements in highly populated Palestinian areas.
</P>
<P>
   The Palestinians officially want the settlers evacuated,
although some Palestinian leaders have suggested that some Jews
could apply for residency.
</P>
<P>
   ''We cannot live with them, it's either us or them,'' said
Khalil Kawasme, who spent much of the afternoon exchanging blows
with Jewish settlers. ''Here's a message for the people in Camp
David: get the settlers out.''

<P>
   PINE LAKE, Alberta (AP) -- A tornado that tossed trailers into a lake while
devastating a crowded campsite killed nine people, sent more than 130 to the
hospital and forced 400 to spend the night in temporary shelters, police said
today. Injured campers, some with broken limbs, wandered in shock while others
frantically searched for missing loved ones after the twister left the Green
Acres campground by Pine Lake, about 90 miles north of Calgary. Divers searched
submerged trailers for more victims.

Tobacco Industry Readies for Appeal

   MIAMI (AP) -- Hundreds of thousands of sick smokers slated to receive a share
of the colossal $145 billion punitive damage award levied against the tobacco
industry may die before ever getting a penny from the tobacco companies. Moments
after Friday's devastating verdict, tobacco companies promised to appeal. The
companies had sought a verdict of less than $400 million and claim the historic
damage award would put their industry out of business. They also say no final
order can be signed for decades until all smokers have their individual
compensation claims heard.

   TEHRAN, Iran (AP) -- Iran test-fired the Shahab-3 missile Saturday, Tehran
television reported, the second trial in two years for the medium-range weapon
capable of reaching Israel or U.S. troops in Saudi Arabia. The state broadcast
said the test was in line with Iran's ''policy of strengthening its defense
capability on the basis of the principle of deterrence.'' In Israel, Deputy
Defense Minister Ephraim Sneh expressed concern Saturday about the missile test
''because Iran actively and relentlessly undermines the peace process through
various terrorist organizations.''

U.N. officials said. The operation began about 6 a.m. in Kailahun, about 200

Rebels fired at U.N. troops and British military Chinook helicopters supporting
the mission, said a senior peacekeeping officer, Indian Maj. Anthanarayan Arun.

Immunity Helped Turn Waco Trial
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
   WACO, Texas (AP) -- Long before an advisory jury decided the federal
government was not responsible for the deaths of Branch Davidians in the Waco
siege, U.S. attorneys had turned the case in their favor. By invoking a federal
law known as the discretionary function exemption, they eliminated several
allegations in the $675 million wrongful death lawsuit brought by survivors of
the 1993 siege and relatives of those who died. That exemption gives federal
officials room to make judgment calls and carry them out without fear of being
sued, even if their decisions prove to be bad.

<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Andrea Stinson scored 24 points and the
Charlotte Sting spoiled Darrell Walker's debut as coach of the
Washington Mystics with a 76-73 victory Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   Washington forced a number of late turnovers to cut a 16-point
second-half deficit to two, but Dawn Staley made one free throw to
make it 76-73 with eight seconds remaining.
</P>
<P>
   The Mystics (9-12) had a chance to tie, but Chamique Holdsclaw's
3-pointer at the buzzer was short.
</P>
<P>
   Walker, the Mystics' director of player personnel, took over as
coach when Nancy Darsch resigned Friday. Walker had coached in the
NBA and CBA, but Saturday's game was his first with a women's team
on any level.
</P>
<P>
   Staley scored 10 points and Stinson eight in the first 15
minutes as Charlotte took a 30-21 lead. The Sting also made 12 of
their first 19 shots in their first road win in five games.
</P>
<P>
   Stinson shot 10-for-14 from the field, and Staley added 17
points for Charlotte (4-17).
</P>
<P>
   Washington was led by Vicky Bullett's 22 points, and Niki McCray
added 19, including 10 in the second half, for the Mystics, who
trail Detroit by 1&AMP;frac12; games for the fourth playoff spot in the
Eastern Conference.
</P>
<P>
   Holdsclaw had trouble getting on track offensively. She scored
10 of her 14 in the second half and made just one field goal
attempt in the first half.
</P>
<P>
   Washington, which trailed 41-34 at halftime, watched the Sting
shoot better than 54 percent from the floor, led by Stinson.

<HEADLINE> Queens mom gets 25 years to life for murdering her 5-year-old daughter </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	   NEW YORK (AP) - A Queens woman, convicted of murdering her
5-year-old daughter, has been sentenced to 25 years to life.
</P>
<P>
   ''You didn't extend any mercy to her, and you don't deserve any
mercy from me,'' said state Supreme Court Justice Richard Buchter
in sentencing Eva Campos on Friday. Campos was convicted last month
of second-degree murder in the July 25, 1998, death of Rosario
Ladino.
</P>
<P>
   Campos confessed to police that she repeatedly hit the 38-pound
girl because the child had soiled her underwear that morning,
according to trial testimony. She pummeled Rosario with a shoe so
many times that she lost count. Campos then sat by, as the girl
slowly died, having seizures, foaming at the mouth and bleeding
from her ears.
</P>
<P>
   ''At that point one would have to have a heart of stone not to
at least try to help this poor battered child,'' Buchter said.
Campos did not call 911, even after the child died in her bed that
afternoon, according to testimony.
</P>
<P>
   Assistant District Attorney Frank DeGaetano told the court that
an autopsy revealed more than 120 distinct injuries on the girl's
body.
</P>
<P>
   Rosario's father, Laurentino Ladino, pleaded guilty in March
1999 to manslaughter and endangering the welfare of a child. The
manslaughter charge was dropped last month in exchange for his
cooperation with the Queens district attorney's office, and he was
sentenced to time served.
</P>
<P>
   He was not called to testify at Campos' trial because he was not
present when the fatal beating took place, prosecutors said.
</P>
<P>
   The couple's two other children, an 8-year-old boy and a
toddler, are now in foster care.

<HEADLINE> Expos 4, Devil Rays 1  </HEADLINE>
By FRED GOODALL
<TEXT>
<P>
   ST. PETERSBURG, Fla. (AP) -- Dustin Hermanson pitched 7 1-3
strong innings and the Montreal Expos broke a four-game losing
streak Saturday with a 4-1 win over the Tampa Bay Devil Rays.
</P>
<P>
   Hermanson (7-7) shut out the Devil Rays on five hits before
giving up a run in the eighth. Closer Steve Kline got the last five
outs for his 12th save.
</P>
<P>
   Vladimir Guerrero drove in two runs with sacrifice flies and the
Expos scored an unearned run in the second inning off Steve
Trachsel (6-9).
</P>
<P>
   Trachsel had been 6-0 in 11 starts against Montreal, all while
he was with the Chicago Cubs.
</P>
<P>
   Miguel Cairo and Felix Martinez opened the eighth with singles
for Tampa Bay. Pinch-hitter Bubba Trammell drove in Cairo with a
one-out grounder.
</P>
<P>
   The Expos added two runs in the ninth on Peter Bergeron's RBI
single and Guerrero's sacrifice fly off Jim Mecir.
</P>
<P>
   Montreal loaded the bases with no outs on first-inning singles
by Bergeron, Jose Vidro and Wilton Guerrero, but they only got one
run out of it on Vladimir Guerrero's sacrifice fly.
</P>
<P>
   Trachsel allowed an unearned in the second when Michael Barrett
doubled with one out and scored when left fielder Steve Cox
mishandled Bergeron's two-out single for an error.
</P>
<P>
   Tampa Bay failed to take advantage of opportunities to cut into
a 2-0 deficit in the third and fourth innings.
</P>
<P>
   Jose Guillen was thrown out at the plate on play in which
Montreal catcher Chris Widger suffered a mild concussion in the
third. Greg Vaughn led off the fourth with a double, but couldn't
score on John Flaherty's two-out single.
</P>
<P>
   Guillen, attempting to score from second on Gerald Williams'
single, appeared to catch Widger in the side of the head with his
knee when he slammed into the catcher, who was blocking the plate.
</P>
<P>
   Widger held onto the throw from left fielder Terry Jones and
Guillen was called out. The catcher remained on the ground for a
couple of minutes before getting up and walking off the field with
help from a trainer and manager Felipe Alou.
</P>
<P>
   Hermanson retired eight in a row before Flaherty singled with
two outs in the seventh. He got out of the inning when the next
batter, Guillen, grounded into a double play.
</P>
<P>
Notes: Trachsel made his team-high 20th start for Tampa Bay,
marking the seventh straight season with 20-plus starts. He hasn't
missed a scheduled turn on the mound since his lone stint on the
disabled list with the Cubs in 1994, a stretch of 182 consecutive
starts ... Vidro (1-for-5) leads the NL with 124 hits. Vladimir
Guerrero (0-for-2) has 118. The Expos team record for a tandem is
387 by Al Oliver (204) and Andre Dawson (183) in 1982 ... The game
threw a crowd of 19,366, which turned out despite a nasty
thunderstorm. The Devil Rays offered each a fan an opportunity to
exchange their ticket stubs for one of two future home dates
against Minnesota and Kansas City.

<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO (AP) -- Gil Heredia pitched 6 2-3 effective innings
as the Oakland Athletics defeated the San Francisco Giants 6-2
Saturday to avoid a sweep and snap a three-game losing streak.
</P>
<P>
   The Athletics won for the first time at Pacific Bell Stadium
after two losses. The Bay Area rivals split their six-game
interleague series this season.
</P>
<P>
   Ramon Hernandez and Miguel Tejada hit consecutive home runs as
the A's won for the fourth time in 14 games. Randy Velarde and Adam
Piatt each had three hits.
</P>
<P>
   Heredia (10-7) allowed two runs on seven hits. He struck out
six, including Barry Bonds three times, and won for the first time
in six starts.
</P>
<P>
   Kirk Rueter (6-5) lost for the first time in eight starts after
allowing three runs -- two earned -- on 11 hits.
</P>
<P>
   Ryan Christenson singled home Tejada to give the A's a 3-2 edge
in the sixth. Tejada reached on an error by second baseman Jeff
Kent.
</P>
<P>
   Hernandez homered off reliever Aaron Fultz in the eighth to give
Oakland a 5-2 edge. Tejada followed with his 16th homer.
</P>
<P>
   Jason Giambi gave the A's a 1-0 lead with a double in the first.
Randy Velarde singled with one out and scored when Giambi drove a
ball to the wall in right field. Giambi tried to stretch the hit
into a triple, but was thrown out by Ellis Burks.
</P>
<P>
   Olmedo Saenz singled home Velarde in the third for a 2-0 lead.
Oakland loaded the bases with two outs, but Hernandez flied out to
Bonds to end the threat.
</P>
<P>
   Burks hit his 11th home run in the fourth. The Giants tied it in
the fifth when Rueter doubled, his first extra-base hit of the
season, and Marvin Benard singled.
</P>
<P>
Notes: The A's announced that RHP Ariel Prieto will be recalled to
start Monday's game in Colorado. ... The Giants reached 1,841,850
in attendance Saturday (45 home dates). It's already the seventh
largest single-season total since the team moved to San Francisco
in 1958. ... A's RHP Chad Harville has yet to make an appearance
since being recalled from the minors on July 3. ... Piatt, normally
a third baseman, made his major league debut in the outfield.

   SACRAMENTO, Calif. (AP) -- After an awful year in which her
brother committed suicide and she underwent major surgery, Suzy
Favor Hamilton has emerged to perform at a level she had never
reached before.
</P>
<P>
   The two events, she said, transformed her attitude toward the
sport.
</P>
<P>
   ''My brother's death just really changed my life in that I
realized how short life can be, especially for my brother, who died
at age 37. It's too young. I realized I may not be here tomorrow. I
have to do things now. I can't wait.''
</P>
<P>
   Hamilton's brother, Dan, was manic-depressive and had stopped
taking his medication shortly before his death.
</P>
<P>
   ''The feeling I had after he died, I'm never going to let that
feeling leave me. Even though I was so hurt and upset, it makes me
feel like I'm ready to conquer the world. I'm ready to do great
things and show the world that I can do it.''
</P>
<P>
   To remember him, his sister has resumed using her maiden name in
competition.
</P>
<P>
   Her Achilles' tendon injury and subsequent surgery also proved
to be a motivation.
</P>
<P>
   ''The injury woke me up and realize I might not have a second
chance,'' she said. ''That was the scariest thing that's ever
happened to me, because I knew I had so much in me to give that I
hadn't even step into yet.
</P>
<P>
   ''There were so many people waiting for this to happen. They
knew it was there, and I was finally able to bring it out and show
everybody what I knew I had.''

   NOT BEST FRIENDS: When Hamilton and Regina Jacobs meet in the
1,500-meter finals Sunday, it will not be a matchup of close
friends.
</P>
<P>
   The two rarely speak, so their joint appearance at a news
conference Saturday was surprisingly good-natured. Afterward,
Hamilton said she really didn't know Jacobs at all.
</P>
<P>
   ''She's just a competitor I don't know,'' Hamilton said. ''Our
personalities don't click. I think we're very extreme.''
</P>
<P>
   Jacobs, who is running her best at age 37, said that the rivalry
between the two is good for the sport.
</P>
<P>
   ''I think we're very different,'' Jacobs said. ''The common
thing we share is we both want to win and we're in the same race,
so naturally that would breed a huge rivalry.''

   JOHNSON'S SHOES: Nike is giving track fans a chance to choose
what spikes Michael Johnson wears in the preliminary rounds of the
U.S. Olympic Track and Field Trials.
</P>
<P>
   Johnson, well remembered for the golden spikes he wore in
winning the gold medal in the 400 and 200 in the Atlanta Games, is
choosing his own colors for the 400 and 200 finals.
</P>
<P>
   But the color of shoes he wears in the preliminaries is being
determined by votes cast on Nike's web site, Nike.com.
</P>
<P>
   In the 400-meter preliminaries on Friday, the winning color was
chameleon green.

   HOLMAN'S PSYCHE: Steve Holman, always among the fastest U.S.
middle-distance runners but often a failure in big meets, broke
through a year ago by winning the U.S. 1,500 championship.
</P>
<P>
   He gives credit to his decision to begin seeing a sports
psychologist after finishing 13th in the 1,500 in the 1996 Olympic
Trials.
</P>
<P>
   ''I had to learn mental skills as well,'' Holman said. ''It's
the sort of thing you have to practice and you have to learn the
procedures and so forth. A lot of it was visualization and positive
self-affirmation, really copying what I did in practice.''
</P>
<P>
   The result, he said, is a much calmer approach to his
competition.

<P>
   NORTH RANDALL, Ohio (AP) -- Milwaukee Brew edged favorite Brave
Quest by a head Saturday in the $300,000 Grade II Ohio Derby for
3-year-olds at Thistledown.
</P>
<P>
   Milwaukee Brew, ridden by Michael McCarthy, ran 1 1-8 miles in

<HEADLINE> Suspected thief strong-armed by determined victim  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	   BUFFALO, N.Y. (AP) - The strong arm of the lady teamed up with
the long arm of the law to collar a man suspected in several
drive-by robberies.
</P>
<P>
   The beginning of the end of Brian J. Hawley's suspected two-week
crime spree came around 5 p.m. Thursday when he tried to grab a
woman's purse in a supermarket parking lot. Police said he parked
his van right up against the woman's car and, when she tried to
squeeze in, grabbed her purse and gunned it.
</P>
<P>
   But the 30-something, would-be victim held on tight and was
dragged some 200 feet across the parking lot before Hawley,
apparently losing control of his vehicle, let go and sped off.
Police caught him a short while later.
</P>
<P>
   The 24-year-old now stands accused of six robberies, including
one in which two elderly women were knocked down in a parking lot
and another where a 66-year-old woman was dragged by a car,
resulting in a broken wrist and chipped teeth.
</P>
<P>
   Hawley has been jailed on charges of attempted robbery and
reckless endangerment.

<HEADLINE> 6 Americans Sample Iraqi Lifestyle  </HEADLINE>
By WAIEL FALEH
<TEXT>
<P>
   BAGHDAD, Iraq (AP) -- Six American opponents of U.N. sanctions on
Iraq set out Saturday to live in a southern city for two months and
experience the hardships ordinary Iraqis face every day -- food
rations, power shutoffs and sewage problems.
</P>
<P>
   Activists from the Chicago-based group, Voices in the
Wilderness, picked al-Jumhoriya district in Basra, 340 miles south
of Baghdad. Allied forces pounded Basra during the 1991 Gulf War
that drove Iraqi troops out of Kuwait. U.S. and British jets still
carry out airstrikes on the area during patrols over southern Iraq.
</P>
<P>
   In Basra, the activists would ''live simply, study Arabic and,
as best as we can, become voices on behalf of people whom we
believe are innocent victims of a pitiless siege enforced by
military might,'' Kathy Kelly of Chicago said Saturday before
setting out from Baghdad.
</P>
<P>
   Voices in the Wilderness, which has a branch in London, seeks an
end to U.N. sanctions imposed on Iraq for its 1990 invasion of
Kuwait, which led to the Gulf War.
</P>
<P>
   The sanctions have crippled the Iraqi economy, and health and
education systems and have left residents dependent on U.N. food
rations. They also are blamed for countless deaths of Iraqi
citizens, especially the very young and elderly.
</P>
<P>
   The group was planning to live on the same amount of food
rations Iraqis receive and deal with the power cuts, bad water and
damaged sewer system in the Basra neighborhood. They planned weekly
reports detailing their activities.
</P>
<P>
   ''We would like for people of the United States and the world to
know what really is going on, otherwise they may remain unaffected
by sufferings Iraqi people endure,'' Kelly said.
</P>
<P>
   Kelly, 47, has visited Iraq 13 times since December 1990, when
she was among hundreds of foreigners to camp out in the Iraqi
desert for 10 days in an attempt to dissuade allied forces from
attacking.
</P>
<P>
   In 1996, she established Voices in the Wilderness, which has
brought delegations of U.S. citizens to Iraq to see for themselves
how the sanctions hurt ordinary Iraqi citizens.
</P>
<P>
   While not a humanitarian aid organization, Voices has delivered
more than $1 million worth of medicines for Iraqi hospitals and
other humanitarian donations.

<HEADLINE> Braves 7, Orioles 3  </HEADLINE>
By DAVID GINSBURG
<TEXT>
<P>
   BALTIMORE (AP) -- Tom Glavine pitched seven strong innings to
earn his third straight win and Javy Lopez homered as the Atlanta
Braves finished a three-game sweep of the Baltimore Orioles with a
7-3 victory Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   The interleague game drew 49,013 fans, the largest
regular-season crowd in the nine-year history of Camden Yards. They
saw the Orioles yield 11 hits, commit two errors and fall 13 games
under .500 (38-51), tying a season high.
</P>
<P>
   Glavine (10-5) allowed one earned run and seven hits, walking
none and striking out three. The left-hander has won his last three
starts after going 0-4 over a seven-game stretch from May 26 to
June 27.
</P>
<P>
   Rafael Furcal drove in two runs in a four-run fourth inning
against Scott Erickson (4-7). Atlanta outscored Baltimore 17-7 in
the series despite trailing in every game.
</P>
<P>
   Mike Bordick homered and drove in two runs for the Orioles, who
were 23-13 at home before the Braves came to town.
</P>
<P>
   Atlanta stranded five runners in the first three innings and
trailed 1-0 before finally breaking through in the fourth. Walt
Weiss hit an RBI single, Furcal followed with a two-run single and
an error by third baseman Jeff Conine allowed another run to score.
</P>
<P>
   Lopez hit his 13th homer in the fifth to make it 5-1.
</P>
<P>
   The Orioles got an unearned run in the sixth but Atlanta went up
7-2 in the seventh, opening the inning with four straight hits to
chase Erickson. One run scored on an error and Weiss hit a
sacrifice fly.
</P>
<P>
   Erickson is rumored to be dealt before the July 31 trade
deadline, but his 7.45 ERA has decidedly lessened his value.
</P>
<P>
   Bordick hit his 15th homer off Mike Remlinger leading off the
eighth.
</P>
<P>
Notes: Braves 2B Quilvio Veras is out for the season after an MRI
on Saturday revealed a torn ligament in his knee. The injury
occurred during a rundown Friday. ... Anderson was ejected by home
plate umpire Paul Emmel after being called out on strikes in the
fifth. ... The Orioles placed 3B Ryan Minor (strained ribcage
muscle) on the 15-day disabled list and called up INF Ivanon Coffie
from Double-A Bowie. ... Conine snapped an 0-for-20 skid with a
second-inning single. ... The Orioles are 27-28 when scoring first.
... Atlanta manager Bobby Cox served the second game of a five-game
suspension for bumping an umpire.

   MONAHANS, Texas (AP) -- A church van returning from a missionary

passengers and injuring five others, police said.
</P>
<P>
   The passengers, all adults, were returning to Porterdale, Ga.,

<HEADLINE> Fla. Governor To Probe Fake Letter  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   TALLAHASSEE, Fla. (AP) -- Gov. Jeb Bush says a letter circulated
in Washington with his supposed signature is a fake, and he wants
investigators to find out who created it, a spokesman said
Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   The letter expresses opposition to legislation before Congress
that would ban gambling on the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   Some governors oppose the bill because it would not allow state
lotteries to sell tickets online, but Bush has taken no position on
the measure.
</P>
<P>
   The New York Times reported the letter was addressed to Rep.
Cliff Stearns, R-Fla., and dated June 23. Stearns said he never saw
the letter, even though it has been circulating on Capitol Hill for
several days and is being used by opponents of the bill.
</P>
<P>
   Bush spokesman Justin Sayfie said Saturday that the governor had
asked the Florida Department of Law Enforcement to investigate.
</P>
<P>
   ''The signature is not the governor's signature, and no one was
authorized to sign this letter on behalf of Governor Bush,'' Sayfie
said. ''At first glance, someone looking at it would have every
reason to believe it was a letter from Governor Bush.''
</P>
<P>
   A public relations firm, Shandwick Washington, said it had asked
Bush's office for a letter giving his position on the legislation
and asked that it be addressed to a member of Congress.
</P>
<P>
   Shandwick represents eLottery Inc., a Connecticut company that
provides computerized services for state lotteries and would profit
from online sales of lottery tickets, the Times reported.
</P>
<P>
   Shandwick spokesman Mark Day said the firm received the letter
in late June.
</P>
<P>
   ''We had every reason to believe it originated in the governor's
office,'' Day said. ''It appeared to be on official stationery and
contained what appeared to be an official signature.''
</P>
<P>
   The firm has stopped circulating the letter, Day said.

<HEADLINE> Jones, Greene Win Semifinal Heats  </HEADLINE>
By BERT ROSENTHAL
<TEXT>
<P>
   SACRAMENTO, Calif. (AP) -- With some of the greatest sprinters in
history in attendance, Marion Jones and Maurice Greene took steps
Saturday toward winning the women's and men's 100 meters in the
U.S. Olympic track and field trials.
</P>
<P>
   The hard-driving Jones flew out of the blocks forcefully, then
wore down the field in winning her heat in 10.93 seconds to advance
to Saturday night's final.
</P>
<P>
   Although Jones' time was 0.01 seconds off her winning
performance in Friday's opening-round heats, she was just as
dominant.
</P>
<P>
   Torri Edwards was a distant second at 11.14, followed by Chryste
Gaines (11.15) and Carlette Guidry (11.20).
</P>
<P>
   Inger Miller, the silver medalist to Jones in last year's World
Championships, won the other semifinal heat at 11.10, with Gail
Devers, the two-time world champion, the runner-up at 11.25.
</P>
<P>
   After the women sprinters competed, the sellout crowd of about
23,000 at Sacramento State's Hornet Stadium was introduced to Edith
McGwire, the 1964 Olympic 200 gold medalist and 100 silver
medalist, and Wyomia Tyus, the 1964 and 1968 Olympic 100 champion.
</P>
<P>
   Before the men ran, two more greats were introduced -- Bobby
Morrow, the 100, 200 and 400 relay gold medalist in the 1956
Olympics, and Jim Hines, the first man to break 10 seconds in the
100, the 1968 100 gold medalist and a member of the 400 relay team
that broke the world record.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps inspired by their presence, the efficient Greene, the
world record-holder and two-time world champion in the 100, raced
to victory in 10.06, about 1&AMP;frac12; meters ahead of runner-up Ken
Brokenburr.
</P>
<P>
   Greene is attempting to become the seventh sprinter in Olympic
history to sweep the 100 and 200. He will compete in the 200 next
weekend against rival Michael Johnson, the world record-holder and
Olympic champion.
</P>
<P>
   Third-place finisher Dennis Mittchell, the 1992 Olympic bronze
medalist, was the most excited about reaching Saturday night's
final.
</P>
<P>
   ''You can't stop me! I'm coming back!'' Mitchell exclaimed.
</P>
<P>
   One of Greene's training partners, Jon Drummond, led all the way
in winning the other semifinal heat at 10.05.
</P>
<P>
   The men's shot put competition turned into one of the best ever.
</P>
<P>
   Adam Nelson, the former world junior champion, uncorked the
world's longest mark this year and his career best, 72 feet, 7
inches, on his final attempt.
</P>
<P>
   C.J. Hunter, Jones' husband, finished second at 71-9, also a
personal best and also on his final attempt, and Andy Bloom took
third at 70-10&AMP;frac34;, another career best and also on his final try.
</P>
<P>
   In another final, Dawn Ellerbe, the American record-holder, led
a 1-2-3 finish by New York Athletic Club athletes onto the first
women's hammer throw team.
</P>
<P>
   Ellerbe, who holds the U.S. best of 231 feet, 2 inches, had the
four-longest throws in the competition, all over 220-0, with her
best at 227-0.
</P>
<P>
   The muscular Ellerbe holds the world indoor best in the 20-pound
weight throw (77-6&AMP;frac14;) and is a five-time indoor champion. This was
her fifth national title.
</P>
<P>
   ''The Olympics are very important to me,'' Ellerbe said. ''It's
one of the things that kept me going all season.
</P>
<P>
   ''I've been chasing and chasing and chasing after it. I finally
caught my dream.''
</P>
<P>
   Joining Ellerbe on the Olympic team for the first women's hammer
throw at the games will be Amy Palmer and Jesseca Cross.

<HEADLINE> Hurricane Bertie Wins at Calder  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   MIAMI (AP) -- Hurricane Bertie beat Bourbon Belle 2&AMP;frac12; lengths
Saturday in the $400,000 Grade III Princess Rooney Handicap, the
highlight of a six-stakes program at Calder.
</P>
<P>
   Five of the stakes were at sprint distances, from two furlongs
to six furlongs, carrying total purses of $950,000.
</P>
<P>
   Jockey Pat Day won the $200,000 Azalea Breeders' Cup on Swept
Away and the $40,000 Burst of Colors, a distance race, on Grand
Veranda. Corey Nakatani won the $200,000 Carry Back on Caller One.
</P>
<P>
   Hurricane Bertie ran six furlongs in 1:11 and paid $8, $5.20 and
$2.60. Bourbon Belle paid $4.40 and $3, and Cassidy paid $2.60 to
show. Hurricane Bertie, the 5-year-old daughter of Storm Boot,
capped a huge day for her owners, Richard Bartram and Elaine Klein,
as well as for Day and trainer Bernie Flint.
</P>
<P>
   Thirty minutes earlier, the same combination triumphed by 3&AMP;frac12;
lengths in the Azalea, also a Grade III event. Swept Away took the
lead on the last turn and brushed off a challenge from Precious
Feather at the eighth pole. Watchfull was third in the six-furlong
race for 3-year-old fillies.
</P>
<P>
   Swept Away was timed in 1:11 2-5 and paid $4.60, $2.60 and
$2.40. Precious Feather returned $4.20 and $3, and Watchfull paid
$3.80 to show. Swept Away, the daughter of Mystery Storm, has won
five of eight and $286,480.
</P>
<P>
   The Carry Back Stakes was an even bigger rout as Caller One, the
odds-on choice, breezed home by five lengths over Fappie's
Notebook. Malagot came from last to finish third in a field of nine
3-year-olds. Caller One put away Gadir on the stretch turn and was
all by himself through the drive.
</P>
<P>
   Caller One ran the fastest six furlongs of the day, 1:10 1-5,
and paid $3.40, $2.80 and $2.40. Fappie's Notebook returned $3.60
and $3, and Malagot paid $6.20 to show. Caller One, by Phone Trick,
has won six of nine starts with earnings of $358,237.
</P>
<P>
   Long shot Miners Gamble won the $100,000 Calder Turf Sprint
Handicap, a five-furlong race on the turf course. Ridden by
Sebastian Madrid, Miners Gamble finished 1&AMP;frac12; lengths in front of
Wertz. The winner was timed in 56 2-5 and paid $24.40.

<HEADLINE> Rangers 6, Diamondbacks 5, 11 Inn.  </HEADLINE>
By MEL REISNER
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHOENIX (AP) -- Luis Alicea delivered his second game-winning hit
for Texas in three games Saturday, an 11th-inning triple that sent
the Rangers to a 6-5 victory over the Arizona Diamondbacks.
</P>
<P>
   John Wetteland pitched a scoreless 11th for his 23rd save in 27
opportunities, preserving a victory for Jeff Zimmerman (3-4), who
worked 2 1-3 scoreless innings.
</P>
<P>
   Greg Swindell (1-3) allowed a one-out single to Mike Lamb and
retired pinch-hitter Dave Martinez before Alicea, who won Thursday
night's game with a two-run single, lined his second hit of the
game to the left-center field gap, scoring Lamb from first.
</P>
<P>
   Bill Haselman, making only his 11th start at catcher in place of
All-Star Ivan Rodriguez, had two RBI doubles off Randy Johnson.
</P>
<P>
   Johnson struck out 12 to pass the 200-strikeout mark for the
ninth time in 10 years, but also allowed five runs, three walks and
seven hits in 7 1-3 innings in one of his shakiest performances
this season.
</P>
<P>
   Johnson, who ranks second to Roger Clemens (10) in 200-strikeout
seasons among active pitchers, gave up the most hits in eight
starts since a season-high nine against St. Louis on May 31, and
the most runs since a season-high five by the Mets at Shea Stadium
on May 21.
</P>
<P>
   Johnson had a two-run double, backing up a two-run homer by Matt
Williams -- his first in three games since returning from the
disabled list.
</P>
<P>
   Haselman's second double scored David Segui, who hit a two-out
single, to cut Arizona's lead to 5-3 and chase Johnson.
</P>
<P>
   Vicente Padilla relieved Johnson and gave up an RBI groundout to
pinch-hitter Rusty Greer and an RBI single to pinch-hitter Mike
Lamb, scoring Haselman.
</P>
<P>
   Johnson, 21-3 in his last 32 regular-season starts, struck out
two batters in each of the first five innings on the way to his
14th game with 10 or more strikeouts this year. He has 139 in his
career, behind only Nolan Ryan's 215.
</P>
<P>
   He struck out Texas starter Matt Perisho looking for the second
out in the fifth for his 2,900th career strikeout and finished with
2,903.
</P>
<P>
   Williams, who had one single in each of his first two games
back, broke a 1-1 tie in the fourth when he lined a 2-2 pitch 385
feet into the left-field grandstand with Luis Gonzalez on board.
</P>
<P>
   It was only his third of the year and the fifth and sixth RBIs
for Williams, who missed the first 43 games with a broken right
foot, and the last 15 after straining his quadriceps on June 25.
His last homer was June 14 off Carlos Perez in Los Angeles.
</P>
<P>
   Johnson made it 5-1 with his two-run double in the sixth.
</P>
<P>
   But pinch-hitter Kelly Dransfeldt tightened it with an RBI
double in the seventh.
</P>
<P>
   The Diamondbacks scored without a hit in the first inning when
Tony Womack led off with a walk, stole second, moved up on a
groundout and scored on Gonzalez's sacrifice fly.
</P>
<P>
   Texas tied it in the fourth when Chad Curtis led off with a
double -- the first hit off Johnson -- and scored one out later on
Haselman's double.
</P>
<P>
   Perisho allowed five runs, nine hits and two walks in 5 2-3
innings.
</P>
<P>
Notes: Johnson reached 200 strikeouts when he got Segui swinging
to end the first inning. ... Perisho is 1-0 against Arizona in his
career. His first win this year came out of the bullpen, a
scoreless seventh inning against the Diamondbacks on June 4.

<HEADLINE> Wetlands, Sewer Projects Aid River  </HEADLINE>
By BEN FOX
<TEXT>
<P>
   IMPERIAL, Calif. (AP) -- It is known as one of the nation's
dirtiest waterways, an 80-mile drain that catches raw sewage and
industrial waste from the Mexican border city of Mexicali and mixes
it with agricultural runoff from the irrigated fields of the
Imperial Valley.
</P>
<P>
   But after years of hand-wringing and bad publicity, the New
River is getting the kind of attention that could end its
notoriety.
</P>
<P>
   A federally financed project to create artificial wetlands that
would cleanse millions of gallons of river water is nearing
completion, and the U.S. and Mexican governments last month
announced $50 million in financing for badly needed upgrades to the
Mexicali sewage treatment system.
</P>
<P>
   The combination could go a long way to removing much of the
pesticides, fertilizers, raw sewage carried by the river into the
Salton Sea, the largest lake in California.
</P>
<P>
   ''Eventually, with what we're doing and what they're doing we'll
clean up a lot of the problems with this river,'' said Leon
Lesicka, a lifelong Imperial Valley resident and chairman of a task
force coordinating river cleanup projects.
</P>
<P>
   Signs of significant improvement in the river could be less than
four years away, said Eugenia McNaughton, an environmental
scientist with the Environmental Protection Agency.
</P>
<P>
   ''This is a workable problem and we are working on it,''
McNaughton said.
</P>
<P>
   So far, the progress is visible only along the river's banks at
two sites near Imperial and Brawley, about 100 miles east of San
Diego, where workers are carving berms and ponds for the artificial
wetlands.
</P>
<P>
   After pumping Colorado River water into the area, workers will
plant bull rushes and other wetland plants. They won't use New
River water out of concern for the workers' health, Lesicka said.
</P>
<P>
   For now, the river remains a fetid mess, especially near the
border at Calexico, where clumps of foam and debris bob on the
surface and the river gives off an acrid smell and burns the eyes
and throat after a few minutes of exposure.
</P>
<P>
   Illegal immigrants float down the river to avoid the Border
Patrol, knowing agents are reluctant to follow them in. Polio,
tetanus and tuberculosis have all been found in the river,
according to the Imperial Irrigation District, the valley's main
water agency.
</P>
<P>
   The river was formed from Colorado River flooding between 1904
and 1906. Waters breached a canal and turned a usually dry creek
bed into a river that flows from about 20 miles south of Mexicali
to the Salton Sea, a lake with no natural outlets that is choking
on its high salinity.
</P>
<P>
   Congress approved $3.75 million for the artificial wetlands to
filter the contaminated water through a process known as
bioremediation. An additional $25 million of federal funding
through the North American Development Bank is the U.S.
contribution to the sewer upgrade in Mexicali, a city that has
grown to an estimated 1 million.
</P>
<P>
   The Imperial Irrigation District, which also is part of the task
force and is building part of the wetlands, will consider adding
more wetlands sites to help filter the water, possibly expanding to
the nearby Alamo River, another Salton Sea tributary, said agency
spokeswoman Sue Giller.
</P>
<P>
   In the artificial wetlands being built, water will flow into
collection ponds, where silt and minerals will settle to the
bottom, then pass through a series of reed-covered berms before
returning to the river again. Biologists will monitor the
collection ponds over three years to see how they affect wildlife.
</P>
<P>
   There's no easy way to explain why the cleanup has taken so
long, said Marie Barrett, a biologist involved with the project and
a lifelong valley resident.
</P>
<P>
   ''Once we realized we had a problem, it took us a long time to
get going,'' she said. ''But now we're actually doing something and
it's so exciting.''

<HEADLINE> Nelson Wins Shot Put Competition  </HEADLINE>
By BOB BAUM
<TEXT>
<P>
   SACRAMENTO, Calif. (AP) -- On a day when Maurice Greene, Marion
Jones and Michael Johnson were the headliners, a hefty trio of shot
putters, including Jones' husband, stole a big share of the
spotlight in the U.S. Track and Field Trials.
</P>
<P>
   Led by surprising Adam Nelson, three throwers topped 70 feet
with personal bests Saturday in one of the most dramatic shot put
performances ever.
</P>
<P>
   Nelson, a 1997 Dartmouth graduate who until two weeks ago was
working 40 to 60 hours a week for a software company, uncorked a
worlds best of 72 foot, 7 inches on his last attempt, the longest
throw in the world this year. Only eight throwers have ever done
better.
</P>
<P>
   The drama wasn't over. On the last throw of the competition,
C.J. Hunter, Jones' massive husband, had a 71-9 mark.
</P>
<P>
   Andy Bloom, who said he couldn't even walk 10 days ago because
of three displaced vertebrae and three displaced ribs, came out of
nowhere on his final throw of 70-10&AMP;frac34; for the third and final spot
on the U.S. team.
</P>
<P>
   ''I don't remember any time there was this kind of competition
in an event, and that includes all the events,'' Nelson said.
''It's unbelievable.''
</P>
<P>
   After Bloom's throw, which came before those of Nelson and
Hunter, there was bedlam around the shot put ring. Nelson jumped on
Bloom's back. Hunter bumped chests with him.
</P>
<P>
   ''Good things happen to good people,'' Hunter said, ''and he's a
good guy. It was just awesome to see him or anybody do what they
have to do when they have to do it. It was just great to see.''
</P>
<P>
   Bloom knocked John Godina, a two-time U.S. champion and 1996
Olympian, off the team with his last throw. Godina, who still has a
chance to make the Olympic team in the discus, was fourth at 69-2&AMP;frac12;.
</P>
<P>
   ''As the meet grew longer I thought more and more that it was
going to hold up,'' Godina said of his best throw. ''Not because
anybody was incapable but just because of the day everybody was
having. Andy was having a terrible day up to that point.''
</P>
<P>
   But Bloom knew he had one good throw in him.
</P>
<P>
   ''Today somebody was smiling at me and I caught one,'' he said.
''I knew when I let go it was a long one.''
</P>
<P>
   The throws ranked first, second and sixth in the world this year
and established the U.S. contingent as perhaps the strongest its
been at the Olympics. But Bloom said no one should be surprised at
the dominant marks on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   ''The winner was a little surprise, but if you didn't realize
the shot put was going to be where it was at, you haven't been
following track and field,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Hunter, who had the world's longest throw entering the meet,
said he could care less that he didn't win.
</P>
<P>
   ''I'm shooting for Sydney,'' Hunter said. ''I've said 100 times
this year I don't care if I win any other meet, as long as I win
the Games.''
</P>
<P>
   The big day raised the specter of a possible U.S. sweep in
Sydney.
</P>
<P>
   ''I really don't care,'' the brutally honest Hunter said. ''I
want to win period. That's it. I don't even think about a sweep and
I hope these guys aren't thinking about it either. When I get to
Sydney, it's all about me. That's just how I feel. It's possible,
yeah, but so what?''

<HEADLINE> Clinton, Barak, Arafat Talk  </HEADLINE>
By LAURA KING
<TEXT>
<P>
   THURMONT, Md. (AP) -- President Clinton and the Israeli and
Palestinian leaders moved Mideast peace talks back into high gear
late Saturday after the end of the Jewish Sabbath, and some
delegates took a somber tour of the Civil War battlefield in nearby
Gettysburg, Pa.
</P>
<P>
   Following a day of informal meetings among the negotiators, some
of them involving the leaders, the pace was picking up, a White
House spokesman said in describing events on the fifth day of talks
at the Camp David presidential retreat.
</P>
<P>
   ''As we approach Day Six, we will look for further
intensification of these discussions,'' said the spokesman, P.J.
Crowley.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton, Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak and Palestinian
leader Yasser Arafat had met until 1 a.m. EDT Saturday in only the
second three-way gathering at the talks that began Tuesday in
Maryland's Catoctin Mountains, 60 miles northwest of Washington.
</P>
<P>
   The president met with Barak on Saturday evening, Crowley said,
and more meetings were possible later.
</P>
<P>
   Secretary of State Madeleine Albright, who sat in as lead
mediator for most of Thursday, was involved in the activity again
Saturday, including a meeting with Arafat. Mindful of the Jewish
Sabbath, which began at sundown Friday and ended at sundown
Saturday, negotiators kept to a slower pace.
</P>
<P>
   Taking a break from their own ancient quarrels, about 15 members
of the Israeli and Palestinian delegations had a firsthand look at
the scene of one of the greatest fraternal bloodlettings in
American history.
</P>
<P>
   The delegates took a two-hour tour of the Gettysburg
battlefield, about 15 miles from Camp David and the site of the
costly July 1863 engagement that was generally considered the Civil
War's turning point. None of the tour participants was a member of
the official negotiating teams, which are secluded at Camp David.
</P>
<P>
   The three leaders' 90-minute late-night session Friday in a
rustic cabin was an intimate gathering, held without delegation
members, the White House said. Other than the leaders, only
interpreters and note-takers were present.
</P>
<P>
   Since Clinton, Barak and Arafat first sat down together Tuesday,
the summit's opening day, Clinton has shuttled between the two
sides in talks described as contentious and difficult.
</P>
<P>
   Summit participants have agreed to disclose nothing of the
substance of the negotiations, but U.S. officials briefing
reporters have repeatedly used words like ''grappling'' and
''struggling'' to characterize the efforts. At one point, White
House spokesman Joe Lockhart described the issues as
''intractable.''
</P>
<P>
   Asked Saturday whether the issues defied solution, Crowley said:
''I don't think any of us think they're impossible -- all of us
agree they are difficult.''
</P>
<P>
   The two sides are deeply divided on key questions including the
boundaries of any future Palestinian state, the fate of several
million Palestinian refugees and status of Jerusalem, which both
sides claim as their capital.
</P>
<P>
   While the negotiators went about their task, Palestinian
demonstrators took to the streets in the West Bank and Gaza Strip,
urging Arafat to stand firm. Israeli peace activists also gathered
in the Jerusalem suburb of Abu Dis to urge that Palestinians be
given a foothold in the disputed city.
</P>
<P>
   Some Palestinian demonstrators made thinly veiled threats of
violence should the summit fail.
</P>
<P>
   ''We give all our support to Arafat and the negotiators in Camp
David,'' said Shafik Tluly, a member of the leadership of Arafat's
Fatah faction. ''But if the summit fails, we are ready for all
possibilities.''
</P>
<P>
   The length of the summit is still uncertain. Clinton is
scheduled to travel to Japan on Wednesday, but U.S. officials have
said that should not be considered a deadline for wrapping up the
peace talks.
</P>
<P>
   Barak left home last Monday amid a political crisis triggered by
the collapse of his governing coalition. Israeli spokesman Gadi
Baltiansky told Israel radio that it would be difficult for the
prime minister to remain away from Israel for much more than two
weeks.
</P>
<P>
   ''It is still our desire to see an agreement ... before the
president leaves for Tokyo,'' Crowley said.

<HEADLINE> Big Political Givers Get Benefits  </HEADLINE>
By JONATHAN D. SALANT
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- From AT&AMP;T to General Motors, several companies
hoping to save their federal subsidies from budget cuts are helping
to pay for cocktail receptions, posh dinners and other glitz at
both political parties' conventions.
</P>
<P>
   Some of the donors have anted up as much as $1 million to each
the Republican and Democratic host committees that are arranging
the entertainment and transportation at the quadrennial events.
</P>
<P>
   The donations allow them to sow good will among the federal,
state and local officials who will attend the GOP event in
Philadelphia later this month and the Democrats' bash in Los
Angeles in August.
</P>
<P>
   The companies' good deeds will not go unnoticed. Their names
will be proudly displayed as ''primary partners, ''platinum and
gold benefactors'' and ''trustees'' in the convention programs and
on the literature and placards on display at the events where
executives can hobnob with Washington's elite.
</P>
<P>
   The companies say their motive is simply to advance democracy
and help defray the cost of staging the massive events.
</P>
<P>
   ''We support the democratic process,'' Lockheed Martin spokesman
James Fetig said.
</P>
<P>
   Others locked in the battle to cut what they see as wasteful
federal subsidies to wealthy companies -- the critics call it
''corporate welfare'' -- suspect another motive.
</P>
<P>
   ''One has got to be a moron and extremely naive to believe that
the wealthy corporations are contributing hundreds of millions of
dollars just for the fun of it,'' said Rep. Bernard Sanders, an
independent from Vermont who has led the battle against the
subsidies.
</P>
<P>
   The Democratic and Republican parties each get $13.5 million in
tax dollars to pay for their conventions.
</P>
<P>
   But the government allows corporations, unions and individuals
to donate unlimited amounts -- and get a tax deduction -- to
convention host committees.
</P>
<P>
   Eight of the 15 companies that have donated to both conventions'
host committees benefit from the federal programs that some
lawmakers are trying to kill. They also have substantial other
business pending with the government, from contracts to regulatory
issues.
</P>
<P>
   GM and DaimlerChrysler have made sizable donations at a time
when they are fighting efforts to trim programs that fund their
research and development.
</P>
<P>
   Last month, the House voted, 214-211, to cut $126.5 million, or
about half the budget, from the Partnership for a New Generation of
Vehicles, a joint venture between the government and the automakers
to develop a car that gets 80 miles per gallon. The Senate has not
decided yet whether to go along.
</P>
<P>
   GM, which has received $8.7 million under the program,
contributed more than $1 million to each convention's host
committee. DaimlerChrysler, which has gotten $19.7 million, is
supporting each to the tune of $250,000.
</P>
<P>
   Both car companies also have received millions of dollars under
the Commerce Department's Advanced Technology Program, which uses
federal and private dollars to develop new products and is another
target of the budget cutters.
</P>
<P>
   GM donated 400 cars to each convention. ''We consider that a
marketing opportunity, making our vehicles available to an
important group of people,'' spokesman William Noack said.
</P>
<P>
   Several other beneficiaries of the Commerce program also are big
givers to both conventions, including communications giants AT&AMP;T,
which has given $1 million to both conventions, and Verizon, the
former Bell Atlantic, which has contributed $1 million for
Philadelphia and $100,000 for Los Angeles.
</P>
<P>
   Another target of the corporate subsidy cutters is the Overseas
Private Investment Corporation, which provides loans and insurance
for companies doing business in developing countries. One OPIC
customer is McDonald's, which has contributed $50,000 to the
Philadelphia convention and $25,000 for Los Angeles. Another is
insurance giant American International Group, which gave $500,000
for Philadelphia AIG and a subsidiary, SunAmerica, also gave $1
million each for Los Angeles.
</P>
<P>
   Keith Ashdown, a spokesman for Taxpayers for Common Sense, an
advocacy group that supports cutting corporate subsidies, worries
about the effect of such donations.
</P>
<P>
   ''It is no secret that money that goes to grease the wheels of
these political conventions makes it difficult to stop the
corporate welfare machine,'' Ashdown said.
</P>
<P>
   But another opponent of the subsidies disagrees, saying
constituent concerns often drive lawmakers' interests more than
political money.
</P>
<P>
   ''Members don't look past the fact that a corporation might have
employees in their district, might have subcontractors in their
district,'' said Rep. Joseph Hoeffel, D-Pa. ''One man's corporate
welfare is another man's desperately needed government program.''

<HEADLINE> Bahraini Royals Want Princess Home  </HEADLINE>
By ADNAN MALIK
<TEXT>
<P>
   MANAMA, Bahrain (AP) -- Relatives of a Bahraini princess who
eloped to the United States with an American Marine want the
teen-ager to return, saying they are prepared to forgive her
transgression, a government official said Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   ''Her family loves her and is really hoping that she will return
home,'' an Information Ministry official said of Mariam Al Khalifa,
19. ''She made a mistake and they are willing to forgive her.''
</P>
<P>
   The official refused to comment when asked whether Al Khalifa's
husband, Pfc. Jason Johnson, also would be welcome.
</P>
<P>
   Bahraini royalty rarely marry outside the family circle. They
also belong to Islam's mainstream Sunni sect. Islam forbids Muslim
women to marry non-Muslim men, though Muslim men can marry outside
their faith.
</P>
<P>
   Al Khalifa met Johnson, who is not a Muslim, last year at a mall
in the Bahraini capital of Manama, where the 25-year-old Marine was
assigned to a security unit. As his deployment was ending late last
year, he forged U.S. military documents used by Al Khalifa to fly
to the United States on a commercial airplane. Immigration
officials in Chicago discovered the ruse.
</P>
<P>
   The Marine Corps demoted Johnson from lance corporal to private
first class and assigned him extra duty. The couple, who married in
Las Vegas, live on the Camp Pendleton military base, north of San
Diego.
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. State Department wants Al Khalifa deported. She has
requested asylum, saying she would face persecution for marrying a
non-Muslim if she returns to Bahrain. She is to appear at an
immigration hearing Monday.
</P>
<P>
   The Information Ministry official said Al Khalifa would not be
harmed.
</P>
<P>
   Al Khalifa has won support from U.S. Sen. Barbara Boxer, a
California Democrat, who urged U.S. immigration officials in a
letter Thursday to allow her to remain in the country.
</P>
<P>
   Al Khalifa's father is believed to be a cousin of Bahrain's head
of state, Emir Hamad bin Isa Al Khalifa.
</P>
<P>
   Bahrain is a small island nation off the eastern coast of Saudi
Arabia that also is the regional base for the U.S. Navy's 5th
Fleet.

<HEADLINE> Rockers 79, Fever 55  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   CLEVELAND (AP) -- Merlakia Jones scored 13 points, as five
Cleveland players scored in double figures in the Rockers' 79-55
victory over the Indiana Fever on Saturday night.
</P>
<P>
   Jones, set to play in her second straight WNBA All-Star Game on
Monday night in Phoenix, hit her first three shots to spark
Cleveland (12-8) to an early lead.
</P>
<P>
   The Rockers never trailed and led by as many as 30 points en
route to their fourth consecutive victory and fifth in six games.
Cleveland pulled within one-half game of first-place Orlando in the
Eastern Conference.
</P>
<P>
   The expansion Fever (5-15) had their first two-game winning
streak snapped. Danielle McCulley led Indiana with 17 points.
</P>
<P>
   Rushia Brown and rookie Ann Wauters each scored 11 points and
Mery Andrade and Vicki Hall added 10 apiece for Cleveland. Wauters,
the first overall pick in this year's draft, also had a game-high
eight rebounds and three blocked shots.
</P>
<P>
   The Fever entered the game leading the WNBA in 3-point shooting,
making 37 percent. However, Indiana shot just 3-for-12 from behind
the arc, and was 19-for-52 (36.5 percent) on field goals overall.
</P>
<P>
   Cleveland, which shot 56.9 percent (33-for-58) dominated every
aspect of the game in rolling to a 39-19 lead at halftime.
</P>
<P>
   Steals by Andrade and center Chasity Melvin led to easy layups
at the other end that helped Cleveland take a 22-7 lead.
</P>
<P>
   After Jurgita Streimikyte scored on a six-foot jumper for
Indiana to make it 22-9, neither team scored for the next 4:34.
</P>
<P>
   Cleveland, which had a 7-25 mark last season, improved to 8-2 at
home.

<HEADLINE> Baritone Louis Quilico Dies  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   TORONTO (AP) -- World-renowned Canadian baritone Louis Quilico,
who sang many of the most famous opera roles, died Saturday at a
city hospital after complications from surgery. He was 75.
</P>
<P>
   The opera singer sang with most of the important operatic
companies in Europe and North America during his 46-year career.
</P>
<P>
   Born in 1925 in Montreal, where his father owned the city's
first bicycle shop, Quilico made his stage debut there at age 29 in
a production of Boris Godunov.
</P>
<P>
   From there, Quilico quickly rose to stardom winning numerous
awards such as the prestigious Metropolitan Opera Auditions of the
Air and the Governor General's Performing Arts Award.
</P>
<P>
   During his career, he appeared regularly at The Vienna
Staatsoper, Teatro Colon of Buenos Aires, Teatro Massimo of
Palermo, Thermes of Caracan, and at the operas of Venice, Turin and
Florence.
</P>
<P>
   At home, he appeared regularly with the Canadian Opera Company
and with the Opera du Quebec.
</P>
<P>
   Quilico is survived by his wife, concert pianist Christina
Petrowska Quilico, with whom he recorded two albums, his son Gino,
daughter Donna, and four grandchildren.

<HEADLINE> Spanish Politician Gunned Down  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   MALAGA, Spain (AP) -- A gunman firing at close range shot and
killed a ruling party politician Saturday night, as the victim's
wife and daughter watched, officials said.
</P>
<P>
   The masked shooter fled on foot after the attack on Jose Maria
Martin Carpena, 49, a Malaga town councilor who belonged to the
center-right Popular Party of Prime Minister Jose Maria Aznar.
</P>
<P>
   At the scene police found six 9 mm shells, a caliber often used
by the Basque separatist group ETA. But Interior Ministry
representative Jose Perez Velasco said it was too early to say if
the shooting was carried out by ETA.
</P>
<P>
   ETA -- the initials stand for Basque Homeland and Freedom in the
Basque language -- has killed some 800 people during a 30-year
campaign for independence of the Basque region of northern Spain.
</P>
<P>
   ''We do not rule out anything,'' he said in a telephone
interview.
</P>
<P>
   Martin Carpena was shot in front of his apartment building as he
was preparing to get into his car with his wife and a young
daughter to attend an awards ceremony at which he was to be master
of ceremonies, Mayor Francisco de la Torre said on the CNN-Plus
television network.
</P>
<P>
   Neighbors gathered outside the apartment building and shouted
''Murderers, Murderers!''
</P>
<P>
   ETA is blamed for five killings since ending a 14-month
cease-fire late last year. A car bomb blast Wednesday in Madrid
that injured nine people was attributed to ETA.
</P>
<P>
   Traditionally the group has targeted military personnel and
police, although in the final few years before the recent truce it
often went after local councilors of the Popular Party, killing
eight since 1995.
</P>
<P>
   Most of these attacks took place in the Basque country itself
but in January 1998 in Seville an ETA gunman killed ruling party
councilman Alberto Jimenez Becerril and his wife Ascension. Both
were shot in the back of the head as they walked down the street.

<HEADLINE> Colombia Rebel Attack Kills 13 Cops  </HEADLINE>
By MARGARITA MARTINEZ
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOGOTA, Colombia (AP) -- Thirteen police officers defending a
small Andean mountain town from a rebel missile attack were
executed after they surrendered, officials said.
</P>
<P>
   The military said Saturday that 20 guerrillas died in an army
counterattack, but that report could not be independently
confirmed.
</P>
<P>
   The police officers fought all night, but their ammunition ran
out after daybreak Saturday in Roncesvalles, the besieged farming
and ranching town 105 miles from Bogota in Tolima State.
</P>
<P>
   When the officers tried to surrender the guerrillas walked into
the police barracks and shot them, national police chief Gen.
Ernesto Gilibert told reporters.
</P>
<P>
   ''They all had a point-blank shot to the head,'' the general
said. ''They died with their weapons in their hands, but no
ammunition.''
</P>
<P>
   One of the 15 officers stationed in Roncesvalles survived the
attack and was being treated for his wounds, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Gilibert said army reinforcements couldn't get to the town until
too late because the guerrillas had blown up sections of the
highway in each direction. Air force strafing was ruled out for
fear of hitting civilians, he added.
</P>
<P>
   The fighting was part of an apparent offensive by the country's
largest leftist insurgency, the Revolutionary Armed Forces of
Colombia, or FARC. Roncesvalles is the fifth town in the same
southwestern area attacked by the FARC since Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   The group is stepping up violence despite the exchange of
cease-fire proposals with the government earlier this month.
</P>
<P>
   Peace talks between the FARC and the government of President
Andres Pastrana are proceeding slowly without a truce.
</P>
<P>
   FARC attacks earlier in the week on the Tolima and Huila State
towns of Santa Marta, Colombia, Vegalarga and Alpujarra killed five
civilians and left police posts, banks and dozens of homes in
ruins.
</P>
<P>
   As they did again Saturday in Roncesvalles -- and have made their
trademark in recent years -- the rebels barraged the towns with
homemade missiles fashioned from gas canisters packed with
explosives.
</P>
<P>
   Police stations are typically the target, but they are usually
located in the center of the town. Nearby homes and businesses are
often flattened as well by the wildly firing missiles.
</P>
<P>
   There were no immediate reports, however, of civilian casualties
in Saturday's fighting.
</P>
<P>
   The governor of Cundinamarca State -- which borders Tolima and
Huila and whose capital is Bogota -- put a nighttime highway curfew
into effect at the military's request.

<HEADLINE> Clinton Will Veto Estate Tax Bill  </HEADLINE>
By LAWRENCE L. KNUTSON
<TEXT>
<P>
   THURMONT, Md. (AP) -- President Clinton pledged Saturday to veto
an ''irresponsible'' repeal of the estate tax passed by a
Republican Congress he said was bent on reckless spending.
</P>
<P>
   ''In recent weeks, the Republicans in Congress have done an
about-face on our strategy of fiscal discipline,'' Clinton said in
his weekly radio address. ''Having already passed more than half a
trillion dollars in reckless tax cuts, this week they passed a
fiscally irresponsible plan to repeal the entire estate tax.''
</P>
<P>
   ''Its costs would explode to $750 billion after 10 years and
every year fully half its benefits would go to just 3,000
families,'' Clinton said in an address aired from Camp David, the
leafy presidential retreat in western Maryland where he is hosting
a Middle East peace conference.
</P>
<P>
   But Republicans said they were ready to approve even more
tax-break legislation.
</P>
<P>
   In the Republican radio address, Rep. Pat Toomey, R-Pa., said
the burgeoning federal budget surplus makes it the perfect time for
Congress to fix the marriage tax glitch and enact other tax cuts.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's just plain wrong for the government to punish people for
getting married,'' Toomey said. ''Washington is swimming in surplus
tax dollars. Let's give some of it back to working Americans by
ending unfair taxes.''
</P>
<P>
   The Senate opened debate Friday on a 10-year, $248 billion
measure that would essentially cut taxes for all married couples by
adjusting their tax brackets and by increasing their standard
deduction to twice that of single taxpayers.
</P>
<P>
   While Clinton had left no doubt that he would veto the bill
repealing estate taxes, he has conditionally pledged to sign the
marriage tax measure.
</P>
<P>
   His price: Congressional approval of separate legislation
creating an acceptable Medicare prescription drug benefit.
</P>
<P>
   No deal, say the Republicans.
</P>
<P>
   ''We're going to pass marriage penalty relief. We're not going
to do it contingent on opening up a brand new entitlement for
unlimited spending,'' said Sen. Don Nickles, R-Okla., the majority
whip.
</P>
<P>
   Democrats are offering an alternative that would simply allow a
married couple to file as single taxpayers or jointly, whichever is
better for them. But it is not likely to prevail.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton said he is convinced the deal he is offering has strong
merits.
</P>
<P>
   ''There's a growing consensus, in the Senate and all across
America, that we need a real Medicare prescription drug benefit --
not a flawed private insurance program that even the insurance
companies admit won't work,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   ''I also think we can agree to protect our hard-fought fiscal
discipline by pledging to use Medicare surpluses only for debt
reduction,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   On Friday, senators voted 59-39 to pass the ''death tax''
elimination bill, ignoring Democratic arguments that it was a tax
cut for the very richest Americans. Sponsors portrayed the measure
as a matter of basic fairness and a remedy for a tax that punishes
success, and most Republicans were joined by nine Democrats in
voting for it.
</P>
<P>
   In a separate statement, Clinton took aim at that position:
</P>
<P>
   ''The Senate is wrong to pass this costly, irresponsible and
regressive bill,'' he said, threatening a veto when it comes to his
desk.
</P>
<P>
   The Senate vote fell short of the two-thirds majority needed to
override a presidential veto.
</P>
<P>
   Only about 2 percent of estates are now taxed by the federal
government -- in 1997, about 43,000 estates out of more than 2
million deaths were affected. But supporters of repealing the tax
said many families and business owners are forced to pay thousands
of dollars to lawyers and consultants for arrangements that protect
their money from tax rates as high as 55 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Today, estate tax collections of about $25 billion represent
only about 1.5 percent of the federal government's overall yearly
tax revenue, but rising incomes have forced more people to worry
about them.
</P>
<P>

<HEADLINE> Devers Out in 100 Meters  </HEADLINE>
By ROB GLOSTER
<TEXT>
<P>
   SACRAMENTO, Calif. (AP) -- Gail Devers missed out on a chance to
make Olympic history. Now she'll have to settle for trying to win
her favorite event.
</P>
<P>
   Devers, one of only two women to win the 100 meters in
consecutive Olympics, failed to qualify for the U.S. team for the
Sydney Games in that event when she finished fifth in the final
Saturday night in the U.S. trials.
</P>
<P>
   She finished in 11.149 seconds, less than two-hundredths of a
second behind third-place finisher Chryste Gaines. The top three --
Marion Jones, Inger Miller and Gaines -- made the team.
</P>
<P>
   Devers, who won gold in the 1992 Barcelona Games and the 1996
Atlanta Games, was trying to become the first woman to win the 100
in three straight Olympics. Only Wyomia Tyus, who watched the race
Saturday from the stands, also won consecutive golds in the 100 --
in 1964 and 1968.
</P>
<P>
   ''That opportunity to make history is gone. Now I have to
concentrate on the hurdles,'' Devers said.
</P>
<P>
   Devers always has considered the 100 hurdles her top race,
though she has failed to win an Olympic medal in that event. She
tripped at the final hurdle while leading by a comfortable margin
in Barcelona, and finished fifth. She was fourth in 1996.
</P>
<P>
   She'll get a chance to make the Olympic team again in that event
starting next Saturday, when the first round of the hurdles is run.
The final is the following day.
</P>
<P>
   Devers also was a member of the U.S. gold-medal 400 relay teams
in Barcelona and Atlanta, and still could be selected for the relay
team.
</P>
<P>
   Devers, 33, nearly was forced to have her feet amputated and
missed a year of competition in 1989-90 because of Graves Disease,
a thyroid abnormality. Since returning to the track, she has been
one of the world's top sprinters.
</P>
<P>
   Recently, she was bothered by a hamstring injury that kept her
out of competition until mid-May.
</P>
<P>
   She still adds a sense of style to the track. Her talon-like
fingernails were jet black at the trials, and she wore a diamond
necklace around her right thigh.
</P>
<P>
   Devers came tantalizingly close at Barcelona and Atlanta to
joining Fanny Blankers-Koen of Holland as the only Olympian to win
both the 100 and 100 hurdles in the same Olympics. Blankers-Koen
did it in London in 1948.
</P>
<P>
   This year, she won't even have a chance to try to pull off that
historic double.
</P>
<P>
   ''Of course I would have loved to have been in the top three. It
wasn't my best race,'' she said. ''I will run some 100s later this
season, but not in Sydney. It will be interesting to be sitting in
the stands for the 100.''

<HEADLINE> Cubs 8, Twins 4  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   MINNEAPOLIS (AP) -- Sammy Sosa tied Joe DiMaggio for 50th place
on the career home run list, hitting No. 361 as the Chicago Cubs
beat the Minnesota Twins 8-4 Saturday night.
</P>
<P>
   Sosa connected in the second inning against Joe Mays for his
25th home run of the season. He homered for the second straight
day, and has hit four in eight games.
</P>
<P>
   Sosa's presence boosted the crowd to 36,688, the Twins' largest
at home since opening day.
</P>
<P>
   Kevin Tapani (6-7) pitched eight innings. He gave up 12 hits,
but helped himself by striking out nine and walking none.
</P>
<P>
   The Cubs won two of three at the Metrodome after taking two of
three against the White Sox. The Cubs have won consecutive series
for the first time this season.
</P>
<P>
   Matt Lawton went 4-for-4 with a homer and three RBIs for
Minnesota, which lost for the ninth time in 11 games.
</P>
<P>
   Tapani, who was with Minnesota from 1989-95, made his third
career start against the Twins and first at the Metrodome since
1996, when he pitched for the White Sox.
</P>
<P>
   Tapani pitched at least six innings for the 17th time in 20
outings.
</P>
<P>
   Minnesota took a 1-0 lead on Lawton's RBI single in the first
inning.
</P>
<P>
   Sosa led off the second with a 417-foot shot off Mays (4-11).
</P>
<P>
   Henry Rodriguez followed Sosa's homer with a triple that center
fielder Jacque Jones lost in the white Metrodome roof. Two outs
later, Willie Greene hit an RBI single to make it 2-1.
</P>
<P>
   Ricky Gutierrez, Mark Grace and Sosa hit consecutive one-out
singles to load the bases in the third inning. Rodriguez then hit a
check-swing double off first baseman Ron Coomer's glove to score
two runs.
</P>
<P>
   Coomer, who hit an RBI double in the sixth, left in the eighth
because of a strained left shoulder.
</P>
<P>
   Grace hit an RBI double in the fourth inning to make it 5-1.
</P>
<P>
   Jones lost another fly ball in the sixth inning, resulting in
Greene's leadoff triple. Brant Brown followed with an RBI single
and Eric Young hit a run-scoring double to make it 7-1.
</P>
<P>
   Jeff Reed hit an RBI double in the seventh off Johan Santana to
make it 8-2.
</P>
<P>
   Lawton, who tied his career high with four hits, hit a two-run
homer off Tapani in the eighth to make it 8-4.
</P>
<P>
Notes: Sosa's next targets on the career home run list are Ralph
Kiner (369) and Gil Hodges (370). ... Tapani, who is 2-0 against
Minnesota, has now appeared in 92 games at the Metrodome. He is
46-30. ... Rodriguez is 7-for-14 in last four games, with two
homers and 10 RBIs. ... Twins manager Tom Kelly missed his third
straight game to be with his father in Fort Myers, Fla. Joe Kelly
is recovering from a heart bypass operation. ... Lawton, who has
had four hits in a game nine times, has played in every game this
season and started all but one.

Clinton, Barak, Arafat Talk
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
   THURMONT, Md. (AP) -- President Clinton and the Israeli and Palestinian
leaders moved Mideast peace talks back into high gear late Saturday after the
end of the Jewish Sabbath, and some delegates took a somber tour of the Civil
War battlefield in nearby Gettysburg, Pa. Following a day of informal meetings
among the negotiators, some of them involving the leaders, the pace was picking
up, a White House spokesman said in describing events on the fifth day of talks
at the Camp David presidential retreat. ''As we approach Day Six, we will look
for further intensification of these discussions,'' said the spokesman, P.J.
Crowley.

   MALAGA, Spain (AP) -- A gunman firing at close range shot and killed a ruling
party politician Saturday night, as the victim's wife and daughter watched,
officials said. The masked shooter fled on foot after the attack on Jose Maria
Martin Carpena, 49, a Malaga town councilor who belonged to the center-right
Popular Party of Prime Minister Jose Maria Aznar. At the scene police found six
9 mm shells, a caliber often used by the Basque separatist group ETA. But
Interior Ministry representative Jose Perez Velasco said it was too early to say
if the shooting was carried out by ETA.

   FREETOWN, Sierra Leone (AP) -- U.N. troops launched a rescue mission Saturday
that freed all 222 peacekeepers and 11 military observers trapped by rebels
inside a U.N. base in eastern Sierra Leone, U.N. officials said. In a rare
display of force, the operation began about 6 a.m. in Kailahun, about 200 miles
east of Freetown, when helicopters picked up the military observers. Rebels
fired at U.N. troops and British military Chinook helicopters supporting the
mission, said a senior peacekeeping officer, Indian Maj. Anthanarayan Arun.

   HEBRON, West Bank (AP) -- The Jewish enclave in Hebron was engulfed for three
hours Saturday by rioting and fist fights between Jews and Arabs, an eruption
that could reverberate on the peace summit in Camp David. Five Palestinians were
hospitalized. Palestinians said the Jewish settlers, known to be the most
adamant opponents of Prime Minister Ehud Barak's peacemaking efforts, started
throwing stones at Palestinians in the afternoon, accusing them of disturbing
their Sabbath rest.

   PINE LAKE, Alberta (AP) -- A tornado struck a campground about 90 miles north
of Calgary today, killing nine people, and sending more than 130 to the
hospital. The twister tossed trailers into a lake while devastating a crowded
campsite, forcing 400 to spend the night in temporary shelters, police said.
Divers searched submerged trailers for more victims.

Colombia Rebel Attack Kills 13
</SUBHEAD>

   BOGOTA, Colombia (AP) -- Thirteen police officers defending a small Andean
mountain town from a rebel missile attack were executed after they surrendered,
officials said. The military said Saturday that 20 guerrillas died in an army
counterattack, but that report could not be independently confirmed. The police
officers fought all night, but their ammunition ran out after daybreak Saturday
in Roncesvalles, the besieged farming and ranching town 105 miles from Bogota in
Tolima State. When the officers tried to surrender the guerrillas walked into
the police barracks and shot them, national police chief Gen. Ernesto Gilibert
told reporters.

Fla. Gov. Wants Letter Investigated
</SUBHEAD>

   TALLAHASSEE, Fla. (AP) -- Gov. Jeb Bush says a letter circulated in
Washington with his supposed signature is a fake, and he wants investigators to
find out who created it, a spokesman said today. The letter expresses opposition
to legislation before Congress that would ban gambling on the Internet. Some
governors oppose the bill because it would not allow state lotteries to sell
tickets online, but Bush has taken no position on the measure. The New York
Times reported the letter was addressed to Rep. Cliff Stearns, R-Fla. Stearns
said he never saw the letter, even though it has been circulating on Capitol
Hill for several days and is being used by opponents of the bill.

<HEADLINE> Cuban Exiles To Launch Memorial  </HEADLINE>
By JAIME HERNANDEZ
<TEXT>
<P>
   KEY WEST, Fla. (AP) -- Dozens of Cuban-Americans held a memorial
service in international waters off Havana on Saturday, throwing
flowers from their boats to remember 41 Cubans who drowned trying
to leave the island six years ago.
</P>
<P>
   They also joined in a prayer for Elian Gonzalez, the 6-year-old
Cuban boy found floating alone off the Florida coast in November
and whose journey home became a half-year international custody
battle.
</P>
<P>
   From their nine boats just outside Cuba's territorial waters,
about 12 miles from the communist island, the 60 boaters sang the
Cuban national anthem and used mirrors to reflect flashes of
sunlight toward Cuba in an effort to communicate.
</P>
<P>
   A cheer arose from the group when a similar light flashed from
the Havana skyline.
</P>
<P>
   ''That was a very important aspect of what we did today,'' Ramon
Saul Sanchez said Saturday night after the flotilla returned to Key
West. ''It's a demonstration that the people on the island are
reaching out to the international community.''
</P>
<P>
   ''It's a shame that we, as Cuban citizens, aren't allowed to
enter our own country,'' said Sanchez, who heads the Democracy
Movement, a Miami-based anti-Castro group that organizes the annual
flotilla.
</P>
<P>
   The event is meant to remember the Cubans who drowned when their
tugboat was overturned on July 13, 1994, by the Cuban coast guard.
</P>
<P>
   The flotilla left Key West late Friday and came within 13 miles
of Havana shortly after 8 a.m. Saturday. When they came one-mile
from Cuban territorial waters, the group was warned by a nearby
U.S. Coast Guard cutter. After requesting permission from the Coast
Guard, the group was allowed to hold its ceremony 12 1/2 miles from
Cuba.
</P>
<P>
   There were no signs of Cuban gunboats during the ceremony. Two
planes from the Miami-based Cuban group Brothers to the Rescue flew
overhead.
</P>
<P>
   ''This is harmful to Castro,'' said Anna Teresa Bonnin, 56, as
she held up a large mirror. ''That is why the Coast Guard doesn't
want us so close. They are under orders from Fidel because he knows
this will harm him.''
</P>
<P>
   Those on the boats accused the U.S. government of conspiring
with Cuban President Fidel Castro during the custody fight over
Elian, which ended with the boy's return to Cuba with his father on
June 28.
</P>
<P>
   Esteban Nunez, 60, prayed for the boy and for the people still
in Cuba.
</P>
<P>
   ''I am praying that they suffer no more,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Elian was found clinging to an inner tube in the Atlantic after
the boat he and his mother were in capsized during a failed attempt
to reach Florida. His great-uncle in Miami took the boy in and
fought the Immigration and Naturalization Service for seven months
to keep the child in the United States.

   FORT LAUDERDALE, Fla. (AP) -- Ariel Graziano scored twice in the
first half as the Dallas Burn beat Miami 3-0 on Saturday night for
their first road victory of the season.

   Dallas improved to 9-11-3 overall and 1-9-2 on the road. Miami

<HEADLINE> Woman, 62, accomplice, 75, charged with bank hit  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	   SYRACUSE, N.Y. (AP) - Police have charged two senior citizens
with robbing a downtown bank.
</P>
<P>
   Eloise Bowman, 62, and James Redfearn, 75, may be the oldest
suspects Syracuse police have ever charged with bank robbery, Sgt.
David Sackett said.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's not very likely you'd see somebody that old arrested in a
bank robbery, or a felony like that,'' Sackett said.
</P>
<P>
   Police said Bowman and Redfearn each face felony charges of
robbery and grand larceny.
</P>
<P>
   Police say Bowman robbed KeyBank on May 10, passing a note
demanding cash. Police at the time said they were unsure of the
thief's gender because the robber appeared to have a woman's face
but a man's hands.
</P>
<P>
   Police say Redfearn drove Bowman from the scene. They did not
disclose how much cash was stolen.
</P>
<P>
   Detectives are investigating whether the pair might be involved
in other city bank robberies, Sackett said.

<HEADLINE> The show goes on for OpSail fireworks  </HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW LONDON, Conn. (AP) - Hundreds of thousands watched what
organizers called the largest fireworks display ever in New England
Saturday night as the grand finale to the four-day OpSail 2000
festival.
</P>
<P>
   Visitors braved the wind and rain Saturday for their last chance
to catch a glimpse of the tall ships.
</P>
<P>
   The weather threatened to snuff the fireworks display, but
organizers managed to pull off the show. OpSail spokesman John
Fleming estimated 300,000 attended the fireworks.
</P>
<P>
   ''It went off on time as planned,'' Fleming said. ''The
enthusiasm of the crowd certainly wasn't dampened.''
</P>
<P>
   Organizers said between 850,000 and 900,000 spectators attended
OpSail over four days.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's been just excellent,'' Fleming said. ''It's just amazing
how well everything came together and how happy everyone seems.''
</P>
<P>
   Roger Vanwey of Gales Ferry was among the spectators who was not
deterred by the rain.
</P>
<P>
   ''We're going to stake our claim,'' Vanwey said. ''We got
umbrellas, tarps and everything else.''
</P>
<P>
   Wendy Sweeney of Niantic also came prepared. ''We did bring a
tent just in case it does rain,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Forty-one ships from the United States, South America and Europe
took part in the event, which organizers hailed as a success for
this historic whaling town. Transportation, stressed by
unexpectedly large crowds on the opening day of the festival, ran
smoothly for the rest of the event and the Coast Guard reported no
serious boating accidents.
</P>
<P>
   The OpSail ships, which have also visited San Juan, Puerto Rico;
Miami; Norfolk, Va.; Baltimore; Philadelphia; and New York, will
head next to Portland, Maine.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, the Amistad - a replica of the 19th-century schooner
whose cargo of African slaves revolted and won their freedom - was
feted in its home port of New Haven.
</P>
<P>
   The Amistad sailed into the harbor after having participated in
OpSail in New York and New London. The vessel was greeted by a
flotilla of other ships and hundreds of drummers and singers,
including members of Boston's Sierra Leone Cultural Organization.
</P>
<P>
   Sierra Leone was the homeland of the 53 Africans who rebelled
aboard the original Amistad in 1839 and were freed after trials in
New Haven and Washington.
</P>
<P>
   When the Amistad docked, it was blessed in a ceremony combining
West African and American traditions.
</P>
<P>
   The two-day festival, featuring a bus tour of New Haven's
historical landmarks and cultural exhibits, will continue Sunday.

<HEADLINE> Wagner Card Auctioned for $1.1M  </HEADLINE>
By DENNIS WASZAK Jr.
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- Honus Wagner is still a big hit after 91 years.
</P>
<P>
   A near-mint condition card depicting the Hall of Fame Pittsburgh
Pirates shortstop, issued in 1909 by the American Tobacco Company,
fetched a winning bid of $1.1 million on Saturday on the eBay
online auction house.
</P>
<P>
   The winning bidder, whose identity was not released, will pay
$1.265 million, which includes a 15 percent buyer's premium.
</P>
<P>
   Robert Lifson, president of Robert Edward Auctions in Watchung,
N.J., confirmed the sale price but said the buyer had not decided
whether to make his name public.
</P>
<P>
   Bidding on the card began at $500,000 on July 5, and 13 total
bids were made.
</P>
<P>
   The card, widely regarded as one of the rarest and most coveted
among collectors, is the finest known specimen of about 50 Wagner
cards known to exist from the 1909 set. Known to collectors as the
T206 set, it remains the most collected set of baseball cards ever.
</P>
<P>
   ''We've had several very high-priced items, but unfortunately
because of the sheer volume of items we don't have a list of
highest auctions,'' eBay spokesman Kevin Pursglove said. ''But it's
safe to say that this Wagner card is in the top two or three.''
</P>
<P>
   The card, won in an auction for $640,500 by renowned
Chicago-based collector Michael Gidwitz in 1996, broke its own
record for a sports card.
</P>
<P>
   ''I had a great time with this card and I'll miss it,'' Gidwitz
said. ''I had a good time buying it and I wish the person who won
it has as good a time with it as I had.''
</P>
<P>
   Gidwitz, 50, said he has been collecting baseball cards and
other memorabilia for 42 years. His extensive collection includes
uncut sheets of baseball cards and rare original paintings of comic
books and MAD magazine covers.
</P>
<P>
   ''The money's nice, but I sold this card to draw attention to
the other things I have in my collection,'' Gidwitz said. ''I owned
it for 3 years and 10 months, and decided I wanted to sell it if I
could have fun doing it. I certainly had fun and I feel like I'm in
the card-collecting hall of fame.''
</P>
<P>
   The Wagner card was bought for $461,000 in 1991 by hockey star
Wayne Gretzky and Bruce McNall, then owner of the NHL's Los Angeles
Kings.
</P>
<P>
   The card was later sold to Wal-Mart, which raffled it off in a
national promotion. The winner, Patricia Gibbs, a Florida postal
clerk, immediately sold the card so she could afford to pay the
taxes she owed for winning it.
</P>
<P>
   Gibbs consigned the card to Christie's of New York City, which
sold it to Gidwitz.
</P>
<P>
   ''I never thought I'd get it,'' Gidwitz said. ''I wanted to know
that I had the best card in the world. If you ask people in card
collecting, this is the Mona Lisa of our hobby. And now, someone
else will be able to have some fun with it.''

<HEADLINE> Torres Wins 50-Meter Freesyle  </HEADLINE>
By BETH HARRIS
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES (AP) -- Dara Torres is still on a tear.
</P>
<P>
   A month after becoming the oldest swimmer to break an American
record, the 33-year-old Torres won the 50-meter freestyle over
rivals Jenny Thompson and Amy Van Dyken in the Janet Evans
Invitational on Saturday night.
</P>
<P>
   Torres swam 25.04 seconds, well off the American record of 24.73
she set last month in Santa Clara. Her coach, Richard Quick, sent
Torres to the blocks with instructions to go under 25 seconds.
</P>
<P>
   ''I wasn't thrilled with my time, but it was a good time
considering I just got done with the 200 (freestyle),'' she said.
''I feel good. I keep improving.''
</P>
<P>
   Thompson finished second in 25.22 and Van Dyken, the '96 Olympic
champion, was third in 25.32.
</P>
<P>
   Three races earlier, Torres was third in the 200 free, while
Thompson was second.
</P>
<P>
   ''My 50 surprised me. It was two one-hundreths off my best
time,'' said Thompson, who set an American record in the 100 free
Friday night. ''I was going into it having fun because the
competition was stiff.''
</P>
<P>
   The women's 50 offered a preview of next month's Olympic trials
in Indianapolis. Torres, Thompson and Van Dyken will battle for two
available Olympic berths in swimming's glamour event. Torres
predicted the winning time will be under her American record.
</P>
<P>
   Van Dyken, a four-time gold medalist in Atlanta, was encouraged
by her time just five months after shoulder surgery.
</P>
<P>
   ''That was my best time in-season ever,'' she said. ''I still do
rehab every Monday and ice all the time. I still do have pain, but
it's very minimal. It's stuff I can deal with.''
</P>
<P>
   Kristen Caverly of San Clemente upset world record-holder Penny
Heyns of South Africa to win the 200 breaststroke in 2:29.83.
</P>
<P>
   ''I really wanted to beat Penny Heyns. She's an awesome swimmer,
but I'm sure that's not all she can give,'' said Caverly, who came
on in the final meters. ''I didn't believe I won that race and I'm
very happy.''
</P>
<P>
   Heyns, the '96 Olympic champion, was second in 2:29.89. Amanda
Beard of Irvine, who finished second to Heyns in the Atlanta Games,
was sixth.
</P>
<P>
   Heyns was still tired from traveling to South Africa last week.
</P>
<P>
   ''Right now my biggest problem is fatigue,'' she said. ''I
managed to pick the last 50 up from this morning. I'm going out
fine but I don't have the second half.''
</P>
<P>
   She plans to swim in next month's Canadian Olympic trials, her
final tuneup for the Sydney Games. Heyns trains in Calgary,
Alberta.
</P>
<P>
   ''I hope to swim a little more decent there and refine things in
training,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Ryk Neethling, Heyns' countryman who swims for Arizona, also was
tired from the same trip last week. But he won the 200 freestyle in
1:50.98 over Bela Szabados of Hungary, who was competing in his
home pool on the Southern California campus.
</P>
<P>
   ''Every day I'm getting better,'' said Neethling, who shunned
the popular high-tech body suit being worn at the meet for
old-fashioned briefs. ''It's a good time. I wanted to swim in the
briefs and go fast.''
</P>
<P>
   In the men's 50 free, Anthony Ervin of Phoenix set a meet record
to win in 22.30 seconds. Bart Kizierowski of Mission Viejo was
second in 22.32. Gary Hall, a silver medalist in the 50 at the 1996
Olympics, was third in 22.63.
</P>
<P>
   In other races, Morgan Knabe of Canada won the 200 breaststroke
in 2:16.91; and Claudia Poll of Costa Rica won the 200 freestyle in
1:58.02, breaking the 12-year-old meet record of 2:00.47 set by her
sister, Sylvia.
</P>
<P>
   Canadians Curtis Myden and Joanne Malar won the 400 individual
medley races in meet record times. Myden swam 4:22.60 and Malar won
in 4:41.47.

<HEADLINE> Jones, Greene Win 100 Meters  </HEADLINE>
By BERT ROSENTHAL
<TEXT>
<P>
   SACRAMENTO, Calif. (AP) -- Shades of Florence Griffith Joyner and
Carl Lewis.
</P>
<P>
   That's how well Marion Jones and Maurice Greene performed
Saturday night in winning the women's and men's 100-meter dashes in
the U.S. Olympic track and field trials.
</P>
<P>
   While their winning times don't appear spectacular compared to
their career bests -- Jones finished at 10.88 seconds and Greene at
10.01 -- there were extenuating circumstances.
</P>
<P>
   Jones, the second-fastest women's sprinter in history, behind
only FloJo, ran into a headwind of 2.24 mph, making her time one of
the fastest under those conditions and the second-fastest in the
world this year, behind her 10.84. Her lifetime best is 10.65.
</P>
<P>
   Greene, the world record-holder at 9.79 and hoping to eventually
surpass Lewis' accomplishments, ran into an even stronger headwind
-- 3.80 mph -- making his performance the best under such adverse
conditions.
</P>
<P>
   Jones, who qualified for the 1992 Olympic team as a relay
alternate while in high school but turned down the opportunity
because she wanted to run an individual race, now will have that
golden opportunity at Sydney.
</P>
<P>
   ''Crossing the finish line I didn't know how emotional it would
be,'' Jones said. ''This was the culmination of a lot of years, the
quest I've been dreaming about a long time.
</P>
<P>
   ''When I was 9 years old I had a dream of making the Olympic
team. Finally, the dream has come true and I don't plan to stop
there.''
</P>
<P>
   This was Jones' first step in her quest to win a record five
Olympic golds. Her next event will be Sunday night in the long jump
final, her most vulnerable event. She will then run the 200 next
weekend, and if she makes the team in all three events, she also is
virtually certain to run on the 400 and 1,600 relays.
</P>
<P>
   Inger Miller, who finished second to Jones in the 100 in last
year's World Championships and won the 200 after Jones was injured
in the semifinals, again finished second at 11.05.
</P>
<P>
   Gail Dvers, the two-time Olympic gold medalist, led for about
half the race, before Jones caught her, then passed her at 60
meters. As Jones crossed the finish line, she threw both hands into
the air, then took a leisurely victory lap, collecting gifts as she
circled the track.
</P>
<P>
   The third member of the 100 team will be Chryste Gaines.
</P>
<P>
   Devers failed to make the team, finishing fifth.
</P>
<P>
   ''That opportunity to make history is now gone,'' Devers said of
her chance to become the first three-time Olympic 100 champion.
</P>
<P>
   In the men's 100, Greene was out of the blocks
uncharacteristically slow and didn't get the lead until 20 meters
remained.
</P>
<P>
   Unheralded Curtis Johnson was second at 10.07, beating Jon
Drummond, who had the same time.
</P>
<P>
   ''Ever since I started running track, ever since I started
paying attention, I would watch on TV and see the Olympics,''
Greene said. ''I would say I can do that, I will be there some day.
</P>
<P>
   ''Finally, the time is here. It's nice to finish what I've
always dreamed of.''
</P>
<P>
   Some of the greatest sprinters in history were in attendance to
watch today's heroes.
</P>
<P>
   After the women sprinters competed in the semifinals, the
sellout crowd of about 23,000 at Sacramento State's Hornet Stadium
was introduced to Edith McGwire, the 1964 Olympic 200 gold medalist
and 100 silver medalist, and Wyomia Tyus, the 1964 and 1968 Olympic
100 champion.
</P>
<P>
   Before the men ran, two more greats were introduced -- Bobby
Morrow, the 100, 200 and 400 relay gold medalist in the 1956
Olympics, and Jim Hines, the first man to break 10 seconds in the
100, the 1968 100 gold medalist and a member of the 400 relay team
that broke the world record.
</P>
<P>
   The men's shot put competition turned into one of the best ever.
</P>
<P>
   Adam Nelson, the 1997 NCAA champion while at Dartmouth and the
1994 world junior champion, uncorked the world's longest throw this
year and his career best, 72 feet, 7 inches, on his final attempt.
</P>
<P>
   C.J. Hunter, Jones' husband and the 1999 world champion,
finished second at 71-9, also a personal best and also on his final
attempt, and Andy Bloom took third at 70-10&AMP;frac34;, another career best,
also on his final try.
</P>
<P>
   Only eight others in history have thrown farther than Nelson,
including three Americans -- world record-holder Randy Barnes, Brian
Oldfield and John Brenner.
</P>
<P>
   ''I'm so fired up, I don't believe what just happened,'' the
elated Nelson said.
</P>
<P>
   ''I felt the hairs on the back of my neck stand up and I felt
the rhythm (on his final attempt). Everything felt slow motion, so
I knew it was going to be a good throw.''
</P>
<P>
   Hunter, who bumped chests with Bloom after the competition, said
the solid American performances would send a message to the world's
other top throwers.
</P>
<P>
   ''This scares the hell out of everybody in Europe,'' the
330-pound Hunter said.
</P>
<P>
   Bloom didn't think he would compete in the trials as late as 10
days ago, because he had three displaced vertebrae and three
displaced ribs.
</P>
<P>
   ''I couldn't walk,'' he said. ''I was a mess.''
</P>
<P>
   The brilliant efforts by the top three meant that John Godina,
Olympic silver medalist and two-time world champion, failed to make
the U.S. team. Godina finished fourth at 69-2&AMP;frac12;.
</P>
<P>
   Michael Johnson, seeking a second consecutive 200-400 double in
the Olympics, strolled through his semifinal heat in the 400 and
still ran 44.63. Johnson, who generally barges into the lead
quickly, waited until about 80 meters before surging to the front.
</P>
<P>
   With about 50 meters to go, he began looking to both sides, and
nobody was close.
</P>
<P>
   Dawn Ellerbe, the American record-holder, led a 1-2-3 finish by
New York Athletic Club athletes onto the first women's hammer throw
team.
</P>
<P>
   Ellerbe, who holds the U.S. best of 231-2, had the four-longest
throws in the competition, all over 220-0, with her best at 227-0.
</P>
<P>
   ''The Olympics are very important to me,'' Ellerbe said. ''It's
one of the things that kept me going all season.
</P>
<P>
   ''I've been chasing and chasing and chasing after it. I finally
caught my dream.''
</P>
<P>
   Joining Ellerbe on the Olympic team for the first women's hammer
throw at the games were Amy Palmer (217-70 and Jesseca Cross
(217-2).
</P>
<P>
   DeDee Nathan, the fourth-place finisher in the heptathlon at the
1992 and 1996 Olympic trials, finally made her first U.S. team,
winning with 6,343 points, four ahead of Shelia Burrell, last
year's national champion. Kelly Blair-Lobounty was third with
6,180.

<HEADLINE> Gallo Blue Chip Wins at Meadowlands  </HEADLINE>
By TOM CANAVAN
<TEXT>
<P>
   EAST RUTHERFORD, N.J. (AP) -- Heavily favored Gallo Blue Chip
took the lead with a three-wide move after the half-mile marker and
drew off to a 3&AMP;frac14;-length victory in the $1.15 million Meadowlands
Pace on Saturday night.
</P>
<P>
   Gallo Blue Chip covered the biggest mile race of the year for
3-year-old pacers in 1:50.4 in his third straight victory and sixth
in his last eight starts.
</P>
<P>
   In giving driver Daniel Dube his first Pace win, Gallo Blue Chip
paid $4.40, $3 and $2.80 and earned $575,000 for owner Martin
Scharf of Lawrence, N.Y. It was the second million dollar win for
the Mark Ford-trained gelding, who won the North America Cup at
Woodbine in Toronto on June 24.
</P>
<P>
   The Brett Pelling-trained entry of Astreos and High On Emotion
finished second and third, respectively, and paid $6.40 and $7.20.
</P>
<P>
   Gallo Blue Chip posted the fastest winning time in the three
eliminations heats for this race last weekend, but the big question
coming into the final was whether the gelded son of Magical Mike
could overcame the No. 9 post.
</P>
<P>
   He did with little problem.
</P>
<P>
   Shortly after the start, Dube moved Gallo Blue Chip quickly from
the outside and got him nestled in fourth place behind Ain't No
Stopn Him, Aces N' Sevens and Tyberwood, the 2-year-old pacer of
the year in 1999.
</P>
<P>
   Ain't No Stopn Him, driven by five-time Pace winner John
Campbell, held the early lead, before Cat Manzi moved Aces N'
Sevens to the front after the opening quarter mile.
</P>
<P>
   Richard Silverman tried to take the lead on the backstretch but
he couldn't get Tyberwood past Manzi and Aces N' Sevens.
</P>
<P>
   Dube moved Gallo Blue Chip to outside approaching the half mile
pole and then he boldly decided to move him to the lead three wide.
Once he was on top, he was never threatened. The gelding opened
five lengths on the field at the top of the stretch and coasted
across the finish line.
</P>
<P>
   ''I was frightened until the half,'' Scharf said. ''Once he
cleared to the lead, nobody can catch him.''
</P>
<P>
   Ford, a 29-year-old native of Lewisburg, W.Va., was relieved to
have the pressure of a long week over.
</P>
<P>
   ''He's really been more than I ever thought,'' Ford said. ''This
doesn't come along very often.''
</P>
<P>
   The Firepan ($12.20) won the $100,000 consolation of the
Meadowlands Pace, covering the mile in 1:50.4 with John Campbell in
the bike.

<HEADLINE> Royals 7, Brewers 4  </HEADLINE>
By DOUG TUCKER
<TEXT>
<P>
   KANSAS CITY, Mo. (AP) -- Joe Randa and Todd Dunwoody drove in two
runs apiece, enabling Jeff Suppan to get his first win since May 24
with a 7-4 victory over Milwaukee on Saturday night.
</P>
<P>
   Suppan (3-6), winless in a span of seven starts and two relief
appearances, was relieved by Ricky Bottalico after giving up a
one-out double to Geoff Jenkins and a single to Jeromy Burnitz in
the eighth.
</P>
<P>
   In 7 1-3 innings, he surrendered four runs on 10 hits, with
seven strikeouts and no walks. He retired Ron Belliard on a ground
ball leading off the game and then struck out the next five
batters.
</P>
<P>
   Bottalico allowed a run on an infield out and got his sixth save
in 12 opportunities.
</P>
<P>
   The Royals, who had lost nine of their last 11, jumped on Jimmy
Haynes (9-8) for five runs in the third. With the bases loaded and
one out, Mike Sweeney dropped an opposite-field single into shallow
right for one run.
</P>
<P>
   Two more runs scored when Jermaine Dye grounded to shortstop
Jose Hernandez, whose throw to first was high for an error. Then
Dunwoody's two-run single made it 5-1.
</P>
<P>
   The Royals loaded the bases again in the fifth on two walks and
Mark Quinn's infield single, and Randa grounded a two-run single
just past third baseman Charlie Hayes.
</P>
<P>
   Haynes, looking for his third straight victory, was charged with
seven runs in 4 1-3 innings, giving up eight hits with five walks
and two strikeouts.
</P>
<P>
   Belliard had an RBI double for Milwaukee in the third, then the
Brewers made it 5-3 in the fourth on Burnitz's 19th home run and
Hernandez's RBI single.
</P>
<P>
Notes: The Royals have won only one of their last nine series,
including this three-game set with the Brewers. ... The Royals
recalled LHP Tim Byrdak from Triple-A Omaha on Saturday and
optioned RHP Jeff D'Amico to the same club. ... The Brewers hit 10
doubles in the three-game series. ... Brewer 1B Tyler Houston took
a spill in the third. He jumped into the air trying to catch a high
throw from SS Hernandez and Jermaine Dye clipped his leg while
crossing the bag. Houston lay on the ground a couple of minutes but
stayed in the game. ... Royals 2B Luis Ordaz made a terrific play
on Hernandez's hot grounder in the sixth, diving to his right to
stop the ball and then getting the runner by a step.

<HEADLINE> Driver in Tenn. Crash Indicted  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   BENTON, Tenn. (AP) -- A grand jury indicted a school bus driver
on three counts of vehicular homicide in a crash with a freight
train that killed three children at the Tennessee-Georgia border.
</P>
<P>
   Rhonda Cloer, 34, was also indicted on four counts of reckless
aggravated assault and on charges of failing to stop a school bus
at a railroad crossing.
</P>
<P>
   She had picked up seven children the morning of March 28 and had
crossed from Tennga, Ga., into Polk County, Tenn., to turn around
when her school bus was hit by a CSX freight train at the crossing.
</P>
<P>
   The Tennessee Highway Patrol and the National Transportation
Safety Board said in preliminary reports that Cloer did not stop at
the railroad crossing, even though school buses are required by law
to stop between 15 and 50 feet away. According to the NTSB
preliminary report, the freight train was traveling under the 60
mph allowed.
</P>
<P>
   Kayla Silvers, 6, and Daniel Pack, 9, died at the scene, and
Amber Pritchett, 9, died the following day. Four other children on
the bus, including Cloer's daughter, Kayli, were injured, as was
Cloer.
</P>
<P>
   Cloer surrendered Thursday after the Polk County grand jury's
indictment and was released on $5,000 cash bond. A hearing was
scheduled for Sept. 11, and a trial could come next year.
</P>
<P>
   Conrad Finnell of Cleveland, a lawyer who represents Cloer, did
not return a phone call Saturday for comment on the indictment.
</P>
<P>
   Her mother, Martha West, said her daughter is distraught.
</P>
<P>
   ''She was very upset. She just said, 'It was an accident,'''
West told Saturday's Chattanooga Times and Chattanooga Free Press.
''It's been really hard on everybody.''

   BOGOTA, Colombia (AP) -- Thirteen police officers defending a small Andean
mountain town from a rebel missile attack were executed after they surrendered,
officials said. The military said Saturday that 20 guerrillas died in an army
counterattack, but that report could not be independently confirmed. The police
officers fought all night, but their ammunition ran out after daybreak Saturday
in Roncesvalles, the besieged farming and ranching town 105 miles from Bogota in
Tolima State. When the officers tried to surrender the guerrillas walked into
the police barracks and shot them, national police chief Gen. Ernesto Gilibert

<HEADLINE> Cohen: US To Take Australian Advice  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   CANBERRA, Australia (AP) -- The United States will look to
Australia for advice on how to handle the aftermath of the coup in
Fiji, U.S. Defense Secretary William Cohen said Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   Cohen said he would discuss the situation in Fiji when he holds
meetings with Australia's Defense Minister John Moore and Foreign
Minister Alexander Downer on Monday.
</P>
<P>
   The United States and Australia are among several nations which
have said they are considering diplomatic and trade sanctions
against Fiji in response to the coup and hostage crisis which
overthrew the elected government.
</P>
<P>
   ''We will discuss what Australia thinks will be the best policy
to pursue,'' Cohen said. ''I think that Australia being closer,
much closer, to the situation, that we can perhaps work together.''
</P>
<P>
   Cohen arrived in Australia late Saturday on the return leg of a
trip to China, his first since China agreed to resume military ties
with Washington, after having cut off all contact following the
U.S. bombing of China's embassy in Belgrade, Yugoslavia, in May
1999.

<HEADLINE> White Sox 15, Cardinals 7  </HEADLINE>
By RICK GANO
<TEXT>
<P>
   CHICAGO (AP) -- The Big Hurt's big night and a nine-run seventh
inning helped the Chicago White Sox end their longest losing streak
of the season.
</P>
<P>
   Frank Thomas hit a three-run homer in the first and a
bases-loaded double in the seventh Saturday night, matching a
career high with six RBIs as the White Sox routed the St. Louis
Cardinals 15-7 to snap a four-game skid.
</P>
<P>
   The White Sox avoided a three-game sweep in the interleague
matchup of Central Division leaders.
</P>
<P>
   Thomas' 28th homer followed a walk to Ray Durham and single by
Jose Valentin in the first. His double down the third- base line
cleared the bases in the seventh and gave him 83 RBIs, six more
than last season.
</P>
<P>
   Jim Parque (9-2) won his sixth straight decision and hasn't lost
since May 17. He allowed five hits and four runs -- three earned --
in five innings.
</P>
<P>
   Darryl Kile (11-6) lasted just 4 2-3 innings, surrendering eight
hits and six runs, and also was involved in the most heated
incident of the night.
</P>
<P>
   After Fernando Tatis, who homered twice Thursday night, was hit
by a pitch for the third time in the series, Kile drilled Magglio
Ordonez in the back in the bottom half of the inning, the fifth.
</P>
<P>
   Chicago manager Jerry Manuel went to the plate to check on
Ordonez, who was writhing on the ground, and began screaming at
Kile.
</P>
<P>
   St. Louis manager Tony La Russa then became animated, but it was
not clear if his comments were directed at Manuel or home plate
umpire Alfonso Marquez.
</P>
<P>
   Ordonez took first, Paul Konerko singled him to third and Chris
Singleton hit a sacrifice fly to push the lead to 6-4 before Jeff
Abbott walked to finish Kile.
</P>
<P>
   Two innings later the White Sox broke it open.
</P>
<P>
   Abbott hit an RBI single, Herbert Perry had a run-scoring
double, Durham drew a bases-loaded walk, and Jose Valentin was hit
by a pitch for another run before Thomas' three-run double off Mike
Matthews. Konerko then added an RBI double and Singleton a
run-scoring grounder.
</P>
<P>
   Eric Davis had a career-high five hits in five at-bats for the
Cardinals with two RBIs. He finished the series 9-for-11.
</P>
<P>
   Tatis hit his 11th homer leading off the ninth against Jesus
Pena, who hit Eduardo Perez in the left shoulder with two outs in
the inning. Perez jumped up and glared at Pena, but made his way to
first. He scored on Keith McDonald's third homer.
</P>
<P>
Notes: Thomas also had six RBIs against Milwaukee in 1996. ...The
White Sox announced the crowd of 40,681 as their seventh sellout of
the season, although some seats were covered for a post-game
fireworks display. ... Parque entered the game with the most
support of any AL pitcher (8.6 runs per game). ... The 15 runs were
the most the Cards have given up this season. St. Louis won the
first two games of the series, 13-5 and 9-4.

<HEADLINE> Wild Sign Draft Pick Marian Gaborik  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   ST. PAUL, Minn. (AP) -- The Minnesota Wild signed first-round
draft pick Marian Gaborik to a three-year contract Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   Gaborik, 18, who flew back to his native Slovakia on Friday,
received a faxed copy of the deal on Saturday morning, signed it
and returned it, agent Allan Walsh said.
</P>
<P>
   The Wild needed to sign Gaborik by midnight EDT Saturday to
avoid paying a $100,000 penalty because of an agreement between the
NHL and the International Ice Hockey Federation.
</P>
<P>
   If an NHL team signs a player under a European contract after
July 15, the NHL team must pay a fee to the European club that owns
the player's rights. In this case, it would have been Dukla Trencin
of Slovakia.
</P>
<P>
   ''He feels very happy to be part of the Wild organization and
feels that the Wild are very classy and have treated him like
family from the moment they drafted him,'' Walsh said.
</P>
<P>
   Gaborik was the third overall pick in last month's entry draft.
The left wing scored 37 goals in two seasons in the Slovakian
Senior League.
</P>
<P>
   The 6-foot-1, 185-pound Gaborik will come to North America in
mid-August to train in Los Angeles for about 10 days before joining
the Wild's inaugural training camp, Walsh said.
</P>
<P>
   Also Saturday, the Wild signed left wing Maxim Sushinsky, the
team's fifth-round pick last month, to a multiyear contract.
</P>
<P>
   Sushinsky, 26, was the second-leading scorer in the Russian
Elite League last season. He had 19 goals and 24 assists for
Avangard Omsk.

   About 20 percent of the employees showed physiological responses
that indicated some ''deception'' when questioned about
unauthorized contacts, Edward J. Curran told The Washington Post
for a story in Sunday editions.
</P>
<P>
   But Curran, a former FBI official, said all of those people
passed the exam when given the opportunity to answer the question
again after being allowed to explain a minor transgression or admit
past conduct that might cause slight feelings of guilt.
</P>
<P>
   ''We have nobody who hasn't gotten through the test, which is a
pretty ... good record, Curran told the newspaper. ''These are not
bank robbers or embezzlers. These are patriotic American citizens
who already have (security) clearances -- you expect them to pass.''

   The Energy Department had a polygraph program for officials in
highly sensitive positions in nuclear weapons programs, but
Congress in January ordered it greatly expanded to cover 13,000
employees following allegations of Chinese espionage at the Los
Alamos National Laboratory in New Mexico.

<HEADLINE> Financial Fraud Gets Home Detention  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   UPPER MARLBORO, Md. (AP) -- A man considered the leader in a
financial scheme that defrauded more than 100 investors, including
author Tom Clancy, of about $8 million, was sentenced to 18 months
home detention because he is gravely ill.
</P>
<P>
   Richard Scott, 54, pleaded guilty in February to three counts of
conspiracy to misappropriate funds and two counts of securities
fraud.
</P>
<P>
   He could have faced 11 years in prison and a $20,000 fine at his
sentencing Friday, but the two sides agreed on home detention and a
$10,000 fine because Scott suffers from severe kidney and liver
failure and must rely on his father for basic physical care.
</P>
<P>
   ''If this sort of unexpected factor of Mr. Scott's dying hadn't
entered into the picture, we would have pressed for a significant
jail term,'' said Carolyn H. Henneman, who argued for the state.
</P>
<P>
   Scott used his friendship with Clancy to persuade investors
across Maryland and Virginia to entrust their money to him, and
promised high returns of at least 15 percent. State investigators
said that he instead used the money for personal expenses.

<HEADLINE> Former Senator John Pastore Dies  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   NORTH KINGSTOWN, R.I. (AP) -- John O. Pastore, a former Rhode
Island governor and U.S. senator who made his mark with a gift for
oratory, died Saturday of kidney failure. He was 93.
</P>
<P>
   Pastore had been in a North Kingstown nursing home for treatment
of Parkinson's Disease.
</P>
<P>
   The son of Italian immigrants, Pastore, a Democrat became one of
the most respected senators ever produced by Rhode Island. His
political career included four years as the state's governor and 25
years in the Senate -- the first Italian-American to serve in either
role.
</P>
<P>
   A little man with a booming voice. Pastore's speaking skills got
national attention when he delivered the keynote address at the
1964 Democratic National Convention. Pastore launched a scathing
attack on Lyndon Johnson's Republican rival, U.S. Sen. Barry
Goldwater, and his fire and eloquence earned him a standing
ovation.
</P>
<P>
   At the time, The Associated Press wrote of Pastore's speech:
''The little Rhode Islander, who stands no taller than a two-pound
keg of mail-it-home salt water taffy, was in the grand tradition of
convention orators.''
</P>
<P>
   Pastore rose from humble beginnings. His parents raised five
children in a four-room tenement apartment on Providence's Federal
Hill, the city's working-class ''Little Italy.'' When he was 9, his
father, a tailor, died of heart failure, and his mother got a job
as a seamstress to support the family.
</P>
<P>
   After graduating from high school, Pastore worked as a clerk at
a Rhode Island utility company. But it was law that intrigued him,
so he began attending classes two nights a week at the Providence
YMCA conducted by Boston's Northeastern University. He eventually
graduated from Northeastern with a bachelor of laws degree.
</P>
<P>
   Pastore once said he realized he had a knack for speaking when
he argued a case before a judge in District Court: ''All of a
sudden, something came over me and I stopped short. I said, 'My
God, is that me?' And that's the first time I knew I could get on
my feet and talk.''
</P>
<P>
   Pastore was elected to the Rhode Island General Assembly in
1934, was re-elected two years later, and served as the state's
assistant attorney general from 1937-38 and 1940-44.
</P>
<P>
   In 1944, he was elected lieutenant governor, and the following
year, at age 36, he became governor when J. Howard McGrath
resigned.
</P>
<P>
   Pastore was re-elected governor twice before winning a Senate
seat in 1950.
</P>
<P>
   While in the Senate, Pastore worked hard for passage of the
first nuclear-test ban treaty, and he became a power on atomic
energy and TV regulation, heading committees dealing with both.
</P>
<P>
   Despite his oratory gifts, Pastore rarely made speeches in the
Senate. He once said: ''The taxpayers don't pay me to make
political speeches on Senate time.''
</P>
<P>
   Pastore retired in 1976.
</P>
<P>
   ''He seized the opportunity that is America,'' Sen. Jack Reed,
D-R.I., said of Pastore on Saturday. ''He was determined to use his
public service to make that opportunity available to all Rhode
Islanders.''
</P>
<P>
   Pastore also frequently encouraged those aspiring to elected
office to ''go out and get it'' and to remember the people they
hoped to serve.
</P>
<P>
   ''I am honored to have known him,'' said U.S. Rep. Patrick
Kennedy, D-R.I. Pastore served in the Senate with his uncles John
and Robert Kennedy. ''He was a role model and an inspiration to
me.''
</P>
<P>
   Pastore is survived by his wife, Elena (Caito) Pastore, son John
Jr. Pastore, and daughters Francesca Pastore and Louise M.
Harbourt. John Jr. Pastore is a Boston cardiologist who became a
major figure in the International Physicians for the Prevention of
Nuclear War, which won the 1985 Nobel Peace Prize.
