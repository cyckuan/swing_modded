Report: Thai oppositon plans no confidence measure in November
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) _ Thailand's largest opposition party is
attemping to organize a no confidence measure against Prime
Minister Chuan Leekpai's government for November, The Nation
newspaper reported Thursday.
	   ``We will censure the entire government, and in particular we
will zero in on the prime minister,'' Chingchai Mongkoltham, deputy
leader of the opposition New Aspiration Party was quoted as saying
in The Nation.
	   The New Aspiration Party, led by former Prime Minister Chavalit
Yongchaiyudh, formed the core of the last government, which was
driven from office by public protests over its inept handling of
Thailand's economic woes.
	   The economic crisis erupted in July 1997 after Chavalit floated
the country's currency, the baht. Thailand was forced to accept a
dlrs 17.2 billion rescue program from the International Monetary
Fund a month later.
	   Chavalit has made several public statements recently that there
were no economic problems during his term of office. They all began
during Chuan's term, which started in November 1997, he said.
	   The NAP will only be able to organize a no confidence debate
with the cooperation of the second largest opposition party, Chart
Pattana, or Thai Development.
	   Chart Pattana leaders have alternately attacked the governing
coalition and expressed a desire to join it. Their support for the
censure debate is not assured.
	   Chingchai said the NAP is choosing November for the debate
because it believes Chuan will call for new elections at the turn
of year to increase his mandate from the public.
	   The NAP hopes that by having a censure debate shortly before an
election will diminish support for the government, which has high
approval ratings from the public.
	   Chuan has said he has no intention of calling elections any time
in the near future.

After rebound on Wall Street, most Asian markets quiet
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   HONG KONG (AP) _ After a small but reassuring gain on Wall
Street, most Asian markets opened on a quiet note Thursday, staying
flat or recouping previous day's losses on a technical rebound.
	   In Hong Kong, bad news on corporate earnings and the gross
domestic product combined with a sharp fall in New York drove the
market down almost 6 percent in the first three days of the week.
	   ``We have had all of our bad news already,'' said trader Sean Li
of Amsteel Securities.
	   Hong Kong's Hang Seng index and Tokyo's Nikkei were flat. The
Hang Seng was down 6 points to 7,460. In Tokyo, the morning session
closed at 15,970.83, down 21.33 points.
	   The action in Hong Kong focused instead on interbank rates,
which rose because of fears that speculators would make an attack
on the Hong Kong dollar.
	   Traders in Tokyo noted a tentative reversal of recent
sentiments. Instead of being pessimistic about Japan's ability to
dig itself out of its troubles, there was hope that Prime Minister
Keizo Obuchi would announce large tax cuts to encourage growth. And
the prevailing optimism about the U.S. economy was replaced by a
wait-and-see attitude.
	   The Dow Jones average fell nearly 300 points on Tuesday, raising
questions about whether an extraordinary run on Wall Street is
coming to a close. Wednesday's trading was volatile as well, but
after initial losses the Dow rebounded to close with a gain of
almost 60 points.
	   Across much of Asia, the markets were about as quiet as they
were in the big markets of Hong Kong and Tokyo.
	   Singapore opened higher on a technical rebound after Wednesday's
losses. Markets in Taiwan, Malaysia and Indonesia all rose
initially.
	   Markets in Seoul and Manila bucked the trend. The Manila market,
which reached a five-year low in previous days, rebounded
Wednesday. On Thursday, investors were cashing in on some of the
previous day's gains, driving the market back down.
	   South Korea's benchmark Korea Composite Stock Price Index was
down about 1.1 percent on fears that a weaker U.S. economy would
hurt Asia, including South Korea.

Sampras wins in post-Wimbledon return
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES in 10th graf with Korda loss &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   TORONTO (AP) _ Pete Sampras, playing for the first time since
his Wimbledon triumph, beat Italy's Gianluca Pozzi 6-1, 6-2 on
Wednesday to advance to the third round of the du Maurier Open.
	   Sampras, who had minor foot surgery July 15, will cede his No. 1
ranking to Chile's Marcelo Rios if he loses in Toronto. Sampras is
on course for a quarterfinal match with Andre Agassi, the eighth
seed who advanced Wednesday night.
	   ``For my first match in a month and first on hardcourt in over
three months, it was a match where I could see the ball very well
playing someone who doesn't have a huge serve,'' Sampras said.
	   ``It gave me some time to get into a rhythm out there and feel
the surroundings and the court speed. ... I was pretty pleased with
how I played.''
	   Sampras is appearing in this event for the first time since
1990, when he lost in the semifinals.
	   The flamboyant Agassi kept pace, downing France's Guillaume
Raoux 6-4, 7-5 in a hard-hitting baseline battle before an
energetic center court gathering of 10,000 spectators. Agassi
recorded his 12th straight win in style _ with an ace _ and
continued his amazing 1998 run. The 28-year-old American has won
four tournaments this year _ including his last two _ and has
jumped 99 spots in the rankings to No. 11.
	   ``I realized I had to go back to square one, I really had to get
back into shape and go play some Challengers and start over,''
Agassi said. ``If I didn't turn things around it (the end) was at
hand.
	   ``The tough part was to be honest about where I was, then
understand where it was I wanted to go and then to set the course
accordingly.''
	   Agassi has dominated this event, winning it three times. He
improved his career record to 24-4 and is an amazing 13-1 in
Toronto.
	   In other matches, Vince Spadea beat second-seeded Petr Korda of
the Czech Republic 5-7, 6-1, 6-4; No. 3 Patrick Rafter of Australia
defeated Neville Godwin of South Africa 7-5, 6-3; No. 4 Yevgeny
Kafelnikov of Russia beat Todd Martin 6-2, 6-3; and No. 7 Tim
Henman of England outlasted Argentina's Guillermo Canas 3-6, 7-6
(7-5), 6-2.
	   Other seeds advancing were: No. 9 Alberto Costa of Spain, No. 10
Goran Ivanisevic of Croatia and No. 14 Mark Philippoussis of
Australia. No. 15 Fabrice Santoro of France lost 7-6 (10-8), 6-2 to
Germany's Tommy Haas.
	   Sampras is bidding to become the only player in ATP history to
be No. 1 six straight years. He shares the mark of five straight
with Jimmy Connors.
	   ``One of my main goals this year was to try to break the
record,'' Sampras said. ``Obviously, I didn't do myself any favors
with the first four months of the year when I wasn't playing that
well.''
	   Should Sampras win the upcoming U.S. Open, he'll tie Roy
Emerson's record of 12 career Grand Slam tournament titles.
	   ``When it's over, it's over, and I'll look back and appreciate
what I've done,'' he said.
	   Rod Laver and Bjorn Borg won 11 Grand Slam tournaments each.
Laver, Sampras' boyhood idol, is recovering from a stroke.
	   ``I was fortunate enough to have seen Rod play when he was in
his prime,'' Sampras said. ``I've thought about him quite a bit
over the past couple of weeks after his stroke, and I certainly
hope I can get a chance to talk to him.''

Albanians assail latest violence in Kosovo
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: RECAPS previous with new material &QL; 
 &UR; By ISMET HADJARI &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   PRISTINA, Yugoslavia (AP) _ Citing the latest wave of Serb
violence, the leader of Kosovo's Albanians and officials in
neighboring Albania issued fresh calls for outside intervention in
the battered province.
	   ``It's time to use all measures for stopping the repression
against thousands of innocent people who are staying in the
mountains, hungry and defenseless,'' Albania's Foreign Ministry
said late Wednesday.
	   The pleas come at a time international sentiments on a possible
military operation to try to halt the conflict remain split,
despite its having entered what U.S. special envoy Richard
Holbrooke called an ``extraordinarily dangerous new phase.''
	   Serb authorities, whose forces are still sweeping through
villages in a powerful offensive against separatists, acknowledged
that they had killed 58 ethnic Albanians in one grisly recent
battle and then buried the unclaimed bodies. They angrily assailed
European newspaper reports of mass graves containing the bodies of
more than 500 ethnic Albanians, most of them children, as a lie,
however, and said all the dead were ``terrorists.''
	   European Union monitors who visited the site at Orahovac, 50
kilometers (30 miles) southwest of the provincial capital Pristina,
said Wednesday they found no evidence of mass graves. Serb police
said 40 Albanians were buried at the site.
	   But a furor continued over recent Serb attacks that have emptied
whole villages and killed civilians as well as rebel fighters from
the Kosovo Liberation Army.
	   ``Serb forces attack and kill unprotected people, systematically
destroy and burn property of Albanians, which led to the
displacement of tens of thousands of Albanians,'' ethnic Albanian
leader Ibrahim Rugova said, reiterating his call for help.
	   Bujar Bukoshi, prime minister of the ethnic Albanians'
government-in-exile, appealed on Albanian TV Wednesday night for
Kosovo Albanians to organize their defenses better. He urged world
leaders and humanitarian organizations to ``take all emergency
measures to halt the genocide in Europe.''
	   But while aid agencies are continuing efforts to provide help to
the refugees, no military intervention appears likely soon.
	   Despite NATO's longstanding threat to step in, officials at NATO
headquarters in Brussels said this week that no military action is
planned at this stage for Kosovo. And on Wednesday, Washington
appeared to ease its position on intervention, based on comments
reported by a visiting German politician.
	   ``We agreed that an intervention _ if that were to happen at all
_ can and should only happen under the umbrella of the United
Nations Security Council with a United Nations mandate,'' German
opposition candidate Gerhard Schroeder said after meeting with
President Bill Clinton.
	   If confirmed, that would be a change of position for the United
States, which is aware that unanimous backing from the Security
Council is currently unlikely. In June, U.S. Defense Secretary
William Cohen said NATO doesn't need permission from the United
Nations if it decides to use force to halt the Kosovo fighting.
	   In a television interview Wednesday, Holbrooke said he wasn't
part of the decision-making process which could order NATO
airstrikes against Serbia or Serbian forces in Kosovo.
	   ``All I can tell you is that the situation has entered an
extraordinarily dangerous new phase,'' he said.
	   The American special envoy accused Yugoslav President Slobodan
Milosevic of reneging on a promise made to EU representatives to
stop military operations against the majority ethnic Albanian
population in Kosovo.
	   ``That was clearly not true, and we are in the middle of a
massive military offensive,'' he told BBC World Service television.
	   Serbian forces are now ``rolling up the Kosovo Liberation Army
forces rather rapidly, creating enormous numbers of refugees,'' he
said.
	   Some of the refugees continue to try to flee Kosovo for other
regions or countries. U.N. refugee agency officials in the Albanian
capital Tirana said Wednesday that 300 refugees had fled into
Albania in the previous two days, joining more than 13,000 who have
fled in recent months.

Mexico governor urges businessmen to hire security guards
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   ACAPULCO, Mexico (AP) _ Admitting that the government cannot
fully protect businessmen fearful of kidnappings, Guerrero state
Gov. Angel Aguirre Rivero encouraged them to hire security guards.
	   ``The businessmen who want to do so can contract the services of
the banking or industrial police since the state government does
not have enough resources to be commissioning or distributing
agents of our forces to businessmen,'' the governor told reporters
Wednesday.
	   The banking and industrial police are agencies hired by private
businesses to provide security.
	   The state attorney general's office says that over the past 17
months, some 131 kidnappings have occurred in Guerrero, which
includes the resort cities of Acapulco and Ixtapa. Thirteen of the
victims were killed.
	   Aguirre denied newspaper reports that state officials were
helping businessmen obtain permits to carry normally banned
weapons.
	   ``I am not saying that businessmen should arm themselves,'' he
said. ``That would be a crime.''

Bars and discos to stay open longer during Commonwealth Games
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia (AP)_ Bars and discos in Kuala Lumpur
have been given permission to remain open until 3 a.m. for one
month beginning Sept. 1.
	   Mayor Kamaruzzaman Shariff said Wednesday the business hours of
entertainment outlets were being extended in view of the
Commonwealth Games which begin Sept. 11, Thursday's Star daily
reported.
	   ``Operators will be allowed to carry out their business until 3
a.m. daily next month as there will be a lot of tourists for the
games,'' Kamaruzzaman said. ``Extension of business hours during
the games would also give operators a chance to earn some extra
money.''
	   Kamaruzzaman said the department had set rules to ensure safety
in these outlets and warned owners that failure to abide by the
rulings will result in severe punishment.
	   Nightspots in the city are now allowed to operate until 1 a.m.
on weekdays and 2 a.m. on weekends and public holidays.
	   Last month, local authorities had refused an extension of
operating hours. They relented after persistent requests by bar and
disco operators.
	   The city expects more than 80,000 tourists during the 10-day
games.

Flood workers recover bodies as another dike bursts in China

<TEXT>
	   WUHAN, China (AP) _ While rescue workers pulled bodies from
floodwaters after a levee along China's Yangtze River collapsed,
another dike downstream burst, releasing a torrent of water that
engulfed thousands of homes, officials said Thursday.
	   Collapsing levees along the Yangtze, the world's third-longest
river, are the worst nightmare for disaster workers who have
struggled for weeks to keep floodwaters at bay.
	   So far, nearly 1,300 people have been reported killed in floods
this year caused by rains that fell earlier and heavier than usual.
	   On Wednesday, a levee that protected 35,000 people in Jiujiang
city, along the Yangtze in south China, gave way. Weaving between
submerged trees and power lines, rescuers on speedboats rushed to
pluck people from the water, the official newspaper Beijing Youth
Daily said.
	   Fears that the levee might collapse prompted officials to move
20,000 people out of area before it ruptured, and another 14,000
people were moved from their homes after the breach, said a
Jiujiang Flood Prevention official, who gave his surname, Xu.
	   As of Thursday, there were no reports of deaths or injuries, he
said.
	   But the bodies of 13 people were recovered in Jiayu, a county
upstream where a levee collapsed Saturday, the official Hubei Daily
reported. Nineteen soldiers who were swept away when the dike burst
were missing, the official China Daily added.
	   After weeks of rain, dikes along the Yangtze are soaked to
saturation and thousands threaten to give way at any time. Millions
of residents and soldiers patrol around the clock, on the lookout
for cracks or signs of weakness. Neck deep in water, they plug
holes and shore up the levees with sandbags, stones and wooden
stakes in anticipation of several more weeks of battle with the
river.
	   Another flood crest, the fourth this year, was rushing down the
Yangtze from Chongqing in Sichuan province, promising more high
waters in the days ahead.
	   In Jiayu, the dike burst and waters poured into fields with
terrifying speed, according to survivors interviewed by AP
Television.
	   A grandmother and lifelong resident, Lin Fengying, estimated
hundreds were swept away. A Hong Kong-based human rights group
claimed Tuesday that more than 1,000 people were believed to be
missing.
	   Jiayu officials said the majority of the 57,000 people who were
flooded out had been resettled, and the government was providing
food and water.
	   A farmer who only gave his surname, Cong, blamed ineffectual
local officials for neglecting the dike and for responding slowly
when disaster struck.
	   ``This was all because of slack vigilance on the part of
officials,'' said Cong.
	   A few days before collapsing, the Jiayu embankment sprung a leak
that was never plugged effectively, the Yangcheng Evening News
reported.
	   The floods have displaced millions of people and inundated vast
stretches of rich farmland along the Yangtze. This year, the river
has risen to levels unseen since flooding in 1954 killed more than
30,000 people.

	   In Oakland, California, Tom Candiotti baffled the Yankees with
his knuckleball, pitching a four-hitter to outduel Hideki Irabu, as
the Oakland Athletics beat New York to avoid a four-game sweep.
	   Irabu allowed just two hits, a soft RBI single by Rafael

in pitching his second complete game of the season.
	   Candiotti (7-13), throwing some pitches as slow as 50 mph (80

the season. He won his second straight start after losing nine of
his previous 10 decisions.
	   The only run off Candiotti came on Tino Martinez' 18th homer of
the season leading off the fifth.
	   Candiotti walked Martinez with two outs in the ninth but then
struck out Darryl Strawberry, who had homered in his last five
games.

Report: human rights activists plan to dig up alleged mass graves
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By IRWAN FIRDAUS &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   BANDA ACEH, Indonesia (AP) _ Human rights activists plan to dig
up what villagers claim are 11 mass graves containing bodies of
those killed in a military crackdown a decade ago, a news report
said Thursday.
	   Indonesian troops have long been accused of committing
atrocities, including arbitrary killings and torture, against
Muslim separatists in the late 1980s and 1990s in the northernmost
province of Aceh, about 1,750 kilometers (1,100 miles) northwest of
Jakarta.
	   There has been no comment by the military or the government on
the allegations. The Indonesian media have widely reported the
allegations by villagers, but human rights workers have yet to
recover any remains themselves.
	   The newspaper Suara Karya said the planned exhumation operation
would begin in September and would involve members of
non-governmental organizations, forensic experts and volunteers.
	   Abdul Gani Nordin, the chairman of a group called the Human
Rights Forum in Banda Aceh, was quoted by the paper as saying the
exhumation would ``prove to the Indonesian people and to the world
that in Aceh there were extraordinary human rights abuses.''
	   Nordin estimated that perhaps thousands of people were killed in
a 1988 military operation dubbed ``Red Net.''
	   One of the grave sites has been nicknamed by local villagers as
``Skull Hill.''
	   According to London-based Amnesty International, Indonesian
soldiers killed some 2,000 civilians in Aceh during civil unrest
between 1989 and 1993.
	   On Wednesday, Rufriadi, a lawyer with the Indonesian Legal Aid
Foundation, said he and other activists were led to the graves
during a visit last month.
	   Villagers said the graves contained the remains of people
executed by troops, Rufriadi told The Associated Press.
	   He said some villagers said they were forced to dig the graves
at gunpoint.
	   Rufriadi said each burial site could contain as many 50 bodies
and that other burial sites might also exist.
	   But an Indonesian parliamentary team that went to the province
last week to investigate the allegations denied local media reports
that it found evidence of mass graves.
	   Aceh is one of three Indonesian provinces where rebels are
fighting for independent states.
	   Local media have published accounts from witnesses and survivors
of torture and rape who said they were victimized by the military
in Aceh.
	   The allegations come as the Indonesian military investigates
separate allegations that members of an elite division kidnapped
anti-government activists in the months before former autocratic
President Suharto resigned and ended 32 years in power in May.

British officials: former trader Leeson has cancer in Singapore
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   SINGAPORE (AP) _ Nick Leeson, the imprisoned former securities
trader whose futures dealing destroyed Britain's Barings bank, is
seriously ill with colon cancer according to reports Thursday from
Singapore government television and the British High Commission.
	   ``We can confirm that he is suffering from a serious illness,
and is currently in the Changi prison hospital,'' a spokeswoman for
the British High Commission told The Associated Press.
	   When asked to confirm Singapore television reports that he had
colon cancer, the spokeswoman replied, ``Yes, he is suffering from
a serious illness.''
	   She said Leeson was being regularly visited by British consular
staff.
	   Leeson, 31, lost dlrs 1.38 billion speculating on Asian stock
markets, causing the 1995 collapse of Britain's oldest merchant
bank, Barings. He is serving a 6 1/2-year prison term that began in
December 1995.
	   His wife, Lisa Leeson, last year said she planned to divorce the
imprisoned former trader.

Iraq stops inspection team from carrying out duties

	   BAGHDAD, Iraq (AP) _ Iraq stopped a team of U.N. weapons
inspectors Thursday from carrying out searches for banned weapons
in Baghdad, an Iraqi government official said.
	   The move came a day after President Saddam Hussein froze
cooperation with inspectors to protest eight years of economic
sanctions. It was the most defiant Iraqi gesture since a crisis
over searches of presidential compounds was resolved in February.
	   Government officials did not accompany the U.N. team in its
search Thursday, the official told The Associated Press. Without
them, U.N. teams are not able to conduct their work.
	   The inspectors were not allowed to conduct ``discussions with

	   The team was supposed to carry out work in Baghdad.
	   The government, however, allowed monitoring of other sites
already inspected to continue. About 460 sites in Iraq have been
inspected and are under monitoring.
	   A convoy of four U.N. vehicles left the Canal Hotel on the
eastern outskirts of Baghdad followed by a similar number of cars
of Iraqi officials. No one interfered with their work.
	   ``Ongoing monitoring continues,'' Janet Sullivan, a U.N.
spokeswoman, told the AP.
	   The move Thursday followed a breakdown in talks between Iraq and
the United Nations over the inspections. Chief U.N. weapons
inspector Richard Butler left Baghdad on Monday.
	   On Wednesday, a government statement said Saddam has decided to
``completely suspend cooperation'' with the U.N. Special Commission

One thousand workers to lose jobs as rubber plants to shut down
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) _ More than a thousand Thais will lose
their jobs when one of Southeast Asia's largest rubber firms shuts
down its curing plants next week, company officials said Thursday.
	   Teck Bee Hang Company will shut down 12 rubber curing plants in
Thailand's southern provinces on August 15. Company officials said
employees will receive severance pay.
	   Unemployment in Thailand is expected to reach 2.2 million this
year as the effects of the country's worst economic crisis in
modern times hits home.
	   Thailand is the world's largest rubber producer, followed by
Indonesia and Malaysia.
	   Company officials declined allegations that they were rushing to
shut the plants before a new labor law takes effect Aug. 19. The
law guarantees workers a minimum of four months severance pay.
	   ``It is the best time for us to curtail operations of
unsuccessful sites and put our money into increasing production at
our 11 bar rubber plants,'' said a company executive, who spoke
only on condition of anonymity.
	   Demand for cured rubber products in Japan, the company's chief
export market, has been falling, she said, adding that as supplies
of raw rubber were less than manufacturers' demand, the company
would use its raw materials to produce bar rubber for the American
and European markets where demand for those products is rising.
	   ``Keeping the unproductive curing plants means big losses,'' she
said.

	   HANOI, Vietnam (AP) _ The Communist Party recruited 47,628 new
members in the first six months of the year, but just 0.9 percent
were university students, the party newspaper Nhan Dan reported
Thursday.
	   The number of new recruits was up 1.19 percent from the same
period in 1997, Nhan Dan said.
	   But while 21.1 percent have university or college degrees, the
low number of students reflects an increasing trend toward
materialism and away from ideology since the party launched the Doi
Moi economic reform program in the mid-1980s.
	   Youth drug addiction and other signs of disaffection have been
rising.

Sugiyama upsets Graf at Toshiba Classic
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with Seles win &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   CARLSBAD, California (AP) _ Japan's Ai Sugiyama overcame cramps
and a late-match deficit to stun former world No. 1 Steffi Graf
6-4, 1-6, 7-5 Wednesday in the dlrs 450,000 Toshiba Tennis Classic.
	   Sugiyama, ranked 17th in the world, called for an injury timeout
after hitting a backhand winner that set up her fourth match point
in the final game of the third set. Sugiyama, suffering from cramps
in her right hamstring and right quadriceps, was treated by a WTA
Tour trainer for nearly three minutes before closing out the
victory.
	   Calling it the ``best match'' of her career, Sugiyama rebounded
from third-set deficits of 2-0 and 5-4 with Graf serving and
needing just two points to win the second-round match.
	   ``This time I played my best tennis,'' said Sugiyama, comparing
her play with her only other meeting with Graf, earlier this year
at Indian Wells. Graf cruised to a 6-0, 6-1 victory.
	   Graf, a four-time winner here, most recently in 1994, suffered
her first loss in the event in 22 matches.
	   ``It's obviously very disappointing,'' she said. ``I played
really well last night and I was going for my shots. I didn't
really do that today from the beginning.''
	   Graf returned to the tour in February after an eight-month
absence because of various injuries. Her world ranking has dropped
to No. 44, although she was seeded sixth here.
	   Fourth-seeded Monica Seles won a wild 7-6 (7-5), 7-5
second-round match over France's Sandrine Testud in the featured
night match.
	   Seles blew a 5-1 first-set lead before finally winning in the
tiebreak. Seles then rallied after trailing 5-1 in the second set.
	   A Graf victory would have set the stage for a quarterfinal-round
matchup with Seles in a battle of former No. 1s. The pair have not
met since Graf won in the final of the 1996 U.S. Open.
	   In other second-round matches, top-seeded Martina Hingis scored
a 6-3, 6-2 win over Natasha Zvereva of Belarus; unseeded Mary
Pierce of France upset No. 5 Conchita Martinez of Spain 6-7 (1-7),
6-2, 6-3, and South Africa's Joannette Kruger beat former French
Open champion Iva Majoli 6-3, 7-6 (7-1).
	   The momentum of the Graf-Sugiyama match changed repeatedly.
Sugiyama won the first set when she scored the only service break
in the ninth game.
	   It appeared Graf had regained control when she took a
competitive second set and won the first two games of the third.
But Sugiyama surprisingly reeled off four consecutive games,
breaking Graf's serve twice as she allowed her German counterpart
just one point in the two games.
	   Graf took a 5-4 lead on her third break of the set and was
serving for the match. Just two points away from victory, however,
Graf failed to close out the win as Sugiyama broke her serve again
to tie the match.
	   Sugiyama went ahead 6-5 before Graf staved off three match
points in the final game. Graf had two chances to tie the match and
send it into a tiebreak, but failed each time.
	   Following Sugiyama's injury timeout, Graf hit a forehand into
the net to end the match.
	   ``She played some amazing shots when it was important,'' Graf
said. ``She really went after everything.''
	   The Hingis-Zvereva score did not reflect the tight nature of the
match.
	   ``Any time I played her,'' Hingis said, ``she gives me a hard
time. ``She's a very smart player, very clever.''
	   Hingis hadn't played in a tournament since losing in the
semifinals of Wimbledon July 2. But the Swiss teen-ager responded
each time Zvereva challenged.
	   Hingis, whose only action since Wimbledon came in a Fed Cup
match in late July, said she was glad to face Zvereva in her first
match of the tournament.
	   ``I'm quite happy that I played Zvereva because she gives you a
lot of time to prepare yourself. She's not one of the big hitters
... You just get the feel of the court.''

Elephant escapes from circus, eludes searchers
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with elephant found by news helicopter &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   MELBOURNE, Australia (AP) _ An elephant named Ginny escaped from
a circus and vanished into woodlands in central Victoria state,
sparking a massive search operation, police said Thursday.
	   Police senior constable Peter Hart, in the normally quiet
wheat-growing town of Dunolly, said officers had been seeking the 1
1/4-ton ton Indian elephant since dawn.
	   People living in the surrounding countryside were warned not to
approach the 34-year-old pachyderm, but immediately contact police.
	   Late on Thursday, an Australian Broadcasting Corp. news
helicopter found Ginny wandering west of the town.
	   Police believed the 13-foot-tall (4-meter-tall) Ginny broke free
from her tether in Perry Brothers circus after being scared by a
nearby train at about 10:30 p.m. Wednesday night.
	   The circus had been in the town of 650 residents 110 miles (175
km) northwest of Melbourne, for several days.
	   ``They searched for her all night in the bush, but as you can
imagine it's pretty hard in the dark, but in daylight the search is
stepping up,'' Hart said.
	   Police and Ginny's handlers led the search, with help from
townspeople and schoolchildren.
	   But the owner of Perry Brothers Circus, Lorraine Maynard, said
they were ``one farm behind her all the time.''
	   Maynard said elephants were not as easy to spot as people
believed.
	   ``With elephants, they can just stand alongside a gum tree and
you can walk right past them and you wouldn't know they were
there,'' she said.
	   ``She might have come out of the bush and she could be in
someone's paddock, standing having a feed with their sheep or their
cows and their horses.''
	   She said Ginny was gentle and not dangerous.

<TEXT>
	   SINGAPORE (AP) _ Nick Leeson, the imprisoned former securities
trader whose futures dealing destroyed Britain's Barings bank, is
seriously ill with colon cancer according to reports Thursday from
the British High Commission and Singapore government television.
	   ``We can confirm that he is suffering from a serious illness,
and is currently in the Changi Prison hospital,'' a spokeswoman for
the British High Commission told The Associated Press.
	   When asked to confirm Singapore television reports that he had
colon cancer, the spokeswoman replied, ``Yes, he is suffering from
a serious illness.''
	   She said Leeson was being regularly visited by British consular
staff.
	   The Daily Mail in London quoted Leeson's father, William, as
saying, ``We are waiting anxiously for more news.''
	   Leeson, 31, lost dlrs 1.38 billion speculating on Asian stock
markets, causing the 1995 collapse of Britain's oldest merchant
bank, Barings. He is serving a 6 1/2-year prison term that began in
December 1995.
	   His wife, Lisa, divorced him after he went to prison and she was
planning to remarry this weekend, according to the Daily Mail.
	   Changi Prison officials refused to confirm anything about
Leeson.

Imported automobile sales fall for 16th straight month
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ Japan's sales of imported automobiles fell for the
16th straight month in July, plunging 19.8 percent from a year
earlier, an industry group said Thursday.
	   Sales of imported cars, buses, and trucks fell to 25,146 in
July, the Japan Automobile Importers Association said.
	   Sales of imports have been tumbling in Japan as the country
struggles through its worst recession in decades. A drop in the yen
against the dollar has also hurt sales by making imports more
expensive.
	   Sales of imported passenger cars fell 17.7 percent to 24,209
while sales of trucks sank 51.7 percent to 933, the group said.
Import dealers sold just four foreign-made buses in July.
	   German automakers accounted for 54.3 percent of import-sales in
Japan, although overall their sales slipped 6.6 percent for the
month to 13,152 vehicles. BMW of Germany was one of the only
foreign automakers to enjoy an increase, selling 3,147 cars, or
37.4 percent more than in the same month a year earlier.
	   Among U.S. automakers, General Motors sold 1,757 cars in Japan
last month, 31.2 percent less than a year before.
	   Sales of cars built in the United States, including those from
the U.S. factories of Honda and Toyota, fell 40.1 percent to 5,097.
	   Just 27 U.S.-made Hondas were sold in Japan last month _ 98.7
percent less than the 2,077 cars it sent to Japan from factories in
the United States last year _ as the company replaced imports with
cars made in Japan.

Major climate changes mean more droughts for South Pacific states
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   WELLINGTON, New Zealand (AP) _ Major droughts will become a
regular weather pattern for some South Pacific states after
significant climate changes in the region over the past 20 years,
scientists said Thursday.
	   They predicted droughts will affect countries such as Fiji,
Papua New Guinea, the Marshall Islands, and the Federated States of
Micronesia.
	   El Nino-induced droughts over the past year have hit all four
states, disrupting crops and water supplies.
	   Research by the National Institute of Water and Atmospheric
Research, in collaboration with the French weather service, Meteo
France, disclosed the climate change, NIWA chief executive Paul
Hargreaves said.
	   He told a briefing in Wellington that since 1977, there had been
abrupt eastward relocation of a belt of storms and winds in the
South Pacific, between Fiji, Samoa, and Tonga, an area known as the
South Pacific convergence zone. El Nino weather patterns had become
more frequent.
	   ``These developments have resulted in the northern Cook Islands,
Tokelau, and parts of French Polynesia becoming substantially
wetter.
	   ``At the same time, Fiji, Tonga, Vanuatu, and New Caledonia have
become drier,'' he said.
	   In Fiji, the drought wiped out between 40 and 60 percent of the
sugar crop, which normally provided 40 percent of export earnings,
and left cane farmers virtually destitute.
	   In Papua New Guinea, Australia spent more than U.S. dlrs 18
million delivering food aid to people in isolated areas, many of
whom were close to starvation.
	   Micronesia was also hard-hit, with one atoll running out of
water, and 37 atolls in Chuuk State _ previously known as Truk _
also running dry.
	   The Micronesian capital, Pohnpei, an island known for having one
of the highest rainfall levels in the world, was reduced to living
off brackish underground water and sending supplies by ship to
neighboring atolls.
	   In the Marshall Islands, the United States has delivered U.S.
dlrs 6.5 million in aid after the year-long El Nino drought closed
down major resources projects, which bit deeply into its exports.
Foreign reserves are not expected to recover for some time.
	   A senior NIWA scientist, Dr. Jim Salinger, said the new analysis
of records showed that central and western Kiribati, Tokelau, and
northeastern Polynesia became 1 degree Fahrenheit (0.3 Celsius)
warmer between 1977 and 1994.
	   Over the same period, these countries became wetter and
cloudier, with a 30 percent increase in rainfall compared with
pre-1977 averages.
	   But in New Caledonia, Vanuatu, Fiji, Tonga, Samoa and the
southern Cook Islands, average rainfall dropped by 15 percent after
1977.
	   The head of environmental management and planning for the South
Pacific Environment Program, Gerald Miles, said in a statement
issued at Apia, Western Samoa, that the NIWA research showed recent
climate changes were not just short-term anomalies.
	   ``It highlights the need for Pacific Island countries to realize
that these changes are likely to continue to impact on them for the
foreseeable future,'' Miles said.

Wall Street tumble leaves Asia worried about its lifeline: a strong
</HEADLINE>
U.S. economy
 &UR; AP GRAPHIC ASIAN EXPORTS UPCOMING
 &UR; By THOMAS WAGNER &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ Call it a one-two punch for Asia's battered
economies, all in the same week.
	   First, the Dow Jones industrial average, which the world has
long considered overvalued, plummets on Tuesday, losing more than
half of its 18 percent gain for the year.
	   Many Asian stock markets quickly follow suit, some dropping
toward levels they haven't seen in months or years.
	   Then the Federal Reserve issues a report on Wednesday saying the
Asian financial crisis and a drought hurting U.S. farmers have
taken their toll on the American economy, which recently saw its
quarterly growth tumble from 5.5 percent to 1.4 percent.
	   Ever since Asia's dramatic downturn began a year ago, setting
off recessions, IMF bailouts, and civil unrest, many people have
wondered how badly it would affect the American economy.
	   Now that the impact is clearly being felt, a new question has
arisen: If the American economy does take a real downturn, how much
worse will the situation in Asia get?
	   The answer, many economists say, is much worse because that
would rob Asia of one of its few routes toward recovery: increasing
its exports of everything from toys and textiles to computers and
automobiles to America's spendthrift consumers.
	   ``The real concern is the domestic side of the U.S. economy. If
private consumption, business investment, housing investment really
tail off, then Asia has a real problem,'' said Russell Jones, chief
economist for Lehman Brothers in Tokyo.
	   ``The United States has the largest economy in the world and
represents the primary export market for most of the Asian
economies,'' Jones said in an interview on Thursday.
	   Robert Allen Feldman, chief economist at Morgan Stanley (Japan)
Ltd., agreed. ``The ability of the U.S. to continue growing is
crucial to the prospects for the Asian economies to be able to grow
out of their problem,'' he said.
	   Like many other countries in Asia, Japan is relying on a
currency that is weak against the dollar to run up a huge trade
surplus with the United States. That helps some of its biggest
corporations such as Sony remain profitable and avoid layoffs,
despite the weak demand at home and across the rest of Asia.
	   That escape route is even more important for other Asian
countries because a recession in Japan, the world's second largest
economy, has dramatically reduced its imports from countries such
as South Korea, Taiwan, China, Thailand and Malaysia.
	   For example, two years ago Malaysia's exports to Japan were
growing at 40 percent a year, according to a recent study by the
Deutsche Bank Group Asia Pacific in Tokyo. Today, they are falling
20 percent a year, the study shows.
	   ``With Japan's economy retracting, Asia has become more
dependent on the United States than ever,'' said Kenneth Courtis,
chief economist and strategist for Deutsche Bank Group. ``If it now
turns, then you have a major problem in Asia. Its countries have
been put on a regimen of export or die.''
	   Courtis said that's just the message that China delivered to
U.S. President Bill Clinton during his visit there this summer:
``If your economy slows and Japan's slump continues, Asia risks
falling into a huge economic conundrum.''
	   Fortunately for Asia, the economic news emanating from the
United States this week wasn't all bad.
	   In New York, Wall Street rebounded Wednesday, leaving everyone
uncertain whether it is simply involved in a needed corrective or
headed for a bear market.
	   At the same time, the U.S. Federal Reserve survey said that
while Asia's difficulties are cutting American exports and
depressing farm prices, strong consumer spending and a booming
housing market are helping to keep the economy on track.
	   If it continues to grow, and it turns out that Wall Street
wasn't warning of tough times ahead, Asia may be able to issue a
sigh of relief and keep going with its export boom.

Officials set hearing on Philippine Airlines rehabilitation
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MANILA, Philippines (AP) _ The Securities and Exchange
Commission said Thursday the committee overseeing a rehabilitation
plan for Philippine Airlines is scheduled to meet next Monday to
discuss progress in keeping the cash-strapped airline in business.
	   The committee will also discuss the replacement of the airline's
president, Jose Antonio Garcia, who resigned last month, it said.
	   PAL's operations have been devastated by labor problems in
recent months. The airline is also buckling under a mountain of
debt and its earnings have been badly hit by the regional financial
crisis.
	   SEC Associate Commissioner Fe Eloisa Gloria is to preside over
the hearing. Gloria was recently appointed by President Joseph
Estrada as acting head of the commission while SEC chairman
Perfecto Yasay is serving a 90-day suspension imposed last month by
the government's ombudsman in a property dispute involving the SEC.
	   The hearing is necessary to fill the president's slot vacated by
Garcia, who reportedly will join food and beverage conglomerate San
Miguel Corp.
	   Garcia's departure, however, may have set back the drafting of
PAL's rehabilitation plan.
	   His resignation reduced to four from five the number of members
of a committee charged with drawing up the survival plan.
	   Among other things, the committee is to deal with the airline's
creditors and take control of all assets.
	   PAL has already secured temporary payment relief on debts
totaling dlrs 2.1 billion.
	   The SEC has given PAL until Sept. 21 to submit a viable
rehabilitation plan.

Iraq stops inspection team from carrying out duties
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with Iraqi newspaper editorial on sanctions, ADDS
background on U.S. stance, monitoring program. &QL; 
 &UR; By LEON BARKHO &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   BAGHDAD, Iraq (AP) _ Iraq stopped a team of U.N. weapons
inspectors Thursday from carrying out searches for banned weapons
in Baghdad, an Iraqi government official said.
	   The move came a day after President Saddam Hussein froze
cooperation with inspectors to protest eight years of economic
sanctions. It was the most defiant Iraqi gesture since a crisis
over searches of presidential compounds was resolved in February.
	   The Iraqi decision could renew a confrontation with the United
States. After Saddam's announcement, U.S. officials had said they
would wait to see what happened when inspectors tried to work.
	   The team was stopped when Iraqi escorts refused to accompany it
in its search Thursday, the official told The Associated Press.
Without them, U.N. teams are not able to conduct their work.
	   In the past, the Iraqis have withheld escorts for the U.N. teams
as a way of impeding the inspections, which are usually carried out
as surprise visits.
	   The U.N. team in Baghdad was not allowed to conduct
``discussions with Iraqi authorities on arms or visits to sites or
searches for past weapons,'' the official said.
	   The government, however, allowed monitoring of other sites
already inspected to continue. About 460 sites in Iraq have been
inspected and are under monitoring. About 100 U.N. experts visit
the sites or use remote-controlled cameras and sensors.
	   Convoys of U.N. vehicles left the Canal Hotel on the eastern
outskirts of Baghdad followed by a similar number of cars of Iraqi
officials. No one interfered with their work.
	   ``Ongoing monitoring continues,'' Janet Sullivan, a U.N.
spokeswoman, told the AP.
	   The move Thursday followed a breakdown in talks between Iraq and
the United Nations over the inspections. Chief U.N. weapons
inspector Richard Butler left Baghdad on Monday.
	   On Wednesday, a government statement said Saddam had decided to
``completely suspend cooperation'' with the U.N. Special Commission
and the International Atomic Energy Agency.
	   It said monitoring activities would be allowed on the condition
that U.N. ``personnel carry out the monitoring strictly respecting
Iraq's sovereignty, security and its people's dignity.''
	   Government-run newspapers lauded Saddam's decision.
	   ``Our people will accept nothing less than the lifting of
sanctions,'' Al-Qadissiya newspaper said Thursday.
	   The sanctions were imposed after Iraq's 1990 invasion of Kuwait
and have crippled the economy by banning the free sale of oil, the
country's economic mainstay.
	   To lift them, inspectors must certify that Iraq's weapons of
mass destruction have been dismantled. Inspectors have been
searching, monitoring and accounting for Iraq's chemical and
biological arms, nuclear program and long-range missiles since
1991.

Carlsberg says it will continue to support sports

<TEXT>
	   KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia (AP) _ International beer manufacturer
Carlsberg said Thursday it would not end its association with
sports in Malaysia despite being ejected by the government from a
Commonwealth Games sponsorship.
	   ``Carlsberg is a Malaysian company and we are part of the
Malaysian society,'' said Jorgen Bornhoft, managing director of
Carlsberg, Malaysia, a subsidiary of the Danish brewery.
	   ``Where we can, we will support,'' said Bornhoft in the first
detailed comment by the company after the Malaysian Cabinet ruled
that Carlsberg could no longer be a sponsor of the games because of
objections to alcohol advertising.
	   Bornhoft declined to give details of the termination agreement,
reached almost one month after the deal was declared dead by the
organizers of next month's Commonwealth Games. But he said the
company had got some of its money back.
	   ``Enough for me to easily face my board of directors and
shareholders.''
	   The controversy erupted after some local groups objected to city
officials about alcohol being advertised in public buses and taxis.
Officials first tried to douse the protests by saying these were
advertisements to promote the games and not for the beer.
	   ``We were caught by surprise,'' said Bornhoft, explaining that
the protest was the first in two years since the 5 million ringgit
(dlrs 1.2 million) sponsorship deal was signed.
	   ``But we have to be reasonable,'' said the chief of the company,
operating in Malaysia for 25 years and which has an annual turnover
of 800 million ringgit (dlrs 200 million) in the predominantly
Islamic country, where Muslims aren't allowed to drink in public.
	   The chief of the Commonwealth Games Organizing Committee Hashim
bin Mohd. Ali said he was ``pleased that an amicable solution'' had
been reached. ``We parted company as friends.''
	   The eviction of Carlsberg would not dent the budget for the
10-day games that begin Sept. 11, he said.
	   Hashim clarified that the June Cabinet decision evicting
Carlsberg applied only to the Commonwealth Games and was not a
blanket ban on the beer maker from ever participating in sports
advertising.
	   He also said that all venues, except one for field hockey, were
ready for use. All facilities would be complete by the end of
August, he said.
	   However, low ticket sales are continuing to worry organizers and
nearly half the tickets for the opening and closing ceremonies in
the new 100,000-capacity Bukit Jalil stadium were still unsold, he
said.
	   But sales were unlikely to affect the 310 million ringgit (dlrs
78 million) budget for the games, he said. So far only 220,000 of
the 1.2 million tickets had been sold.
	   More than 4,100 athletes from 70 countries are expected to
participate in the games, being staged for the first time in Asia.

<TEXT>
	   UNITED NATIONS (AP) _ Already facing an Iraqi freeze in
cooperation, the chief U.N. weapons inspector will find little
consolation when he meets with the Security Council.
	   Richard Butler blames the Iraqis for the breakdown in talks this
week that led President Saddam Hussein on Thursday to block
inspectors from carrying out searches for banned weapons in
Baghdad. Saddam declared a freeze Wednesday on dealings with the
inspectors.
	   But some members of the powerful U.N. Security Council, eager to
end seven years of sanctions on Iraq, will likely blame Butler when
the chief inspector briefs them on Thursday.
	   ``We are strongly convinced that Iraq is not the only one to
blame for this situation,'' Yuriy Fedotov, Russia's No. 2 man at
the United Nations, said after a council meeting Wednesday.
	   He said Butler stopped the talks Monday without consulting his
bosses in New York _ the council and Secretary-General Kofi Annan.
	   Butler strongly denied that, saying Iraqi Deputy Prime Minister
Tariq Aziz ended the talks when Butler refused to declare the
Iraqis in full compliance with the inspection program.
	   ``What is at issue here is the decisions of the Security Council
which are binding in international law,'' Butler said before
meeting with Annan on Wednesday ``Whether or not Iraq is prepared
to accept that law is what is at issue.''
	   Iraq has been trying to get international sanctions lifted. The
sanctions, imposed after Iraq invaded Kuwait in 1990, cannot be
lifted by the council until the U.N. inspectors certify Iraq has
destroyed all its chemical and biological weapons and long-range
missiles. The sanctions ban Iraq from freely exporting its most
valuable commodity _ oil.
	   In Baghdad on Thursday, an inspection team was stopped when it
tried to search suspected weapons sites. The United States had
downplayed Saddam's declaration Wednesday of a freeze on
cooperation, saying it would wait to see what happened when
inspectors tried to continue their work.

	   HIROSHIMA, Japan (AP) _ Prime Minister Keizo Obuchi used the
53rd anniversary of the atomic bombing of Hiroshima on Thursday to
urge India and Pakistan to stop their nuclear weapons testing
programs.
	   ``It is very regrettable that both India and Pakistan carried
out nuclear tests in May,'' said Obuchi, who took office last month
and appeared for the first time at the time-honored and solemn
annual ceremony of the world's first atomic attack.
	   Speaking to tens of thousands of people in Hiroshima _ including
the Indian and Pakistani ambassadors _ Obuchi said the Japanese
government was strongly urging both countries to immediately stop
nuclear testing, to unconditionally sign the comprehensive test ban
treaty, and to halt development of nuclear weapons and the missiles
that carry them.
	   India and Pakistan have come under intense international
criticism _ including the imposition of sanctions _ since carrying
out their nuclear tests, raising fears that international efforts
to rein in nuclear proliferation could be seriously damaged.
	   Ceremonies marking the anniversary of the U.S. bombing of
Hiroshima began with the offering of flowers at its Peace Park,
followed by a moment of silent prayer at 8:15 a.m. (2315 GMT) _ the
exact moment the bomb exploded above the city on Aug. 6, 1945.
	   The summer weather Thursday was hot with hazy skies. As in most
years, the moment of silence was broken only by the ringing of a
Buddhist bell and the constant chirping of cicadas.
	   Many among the estimated crowd of 50,000 clasped their hands in
prayer. Others held Buddhist prayer beads. But some passersby near
the park continued on their way to work as the bells tolled.
	   Hiroshima for the first time invited ambassadors to Japan from
the five major nuclear powers _ the United States, Britain, China,
France and Russia _ as well as those from India and Pakistan, to
attend Thursday's ceremony.
	   But only India's Sidharth Singh and Pakistan's Touqir Hussain
attended, said Mayumi Tochino of the Hiroshima city hall.
	   Hussain said he attended the ceremony ``to share the pain and
suffering of the Japanese people and the people of Hiroshima as
they recall this tragedy.''
	   Anti-nuclear peace marches or rallies also were scheduled later
in the day in India and Pakistan.
	   Addressing the crowd in Hiroshima, Mayor Takashi Hiraoka said
the nuclear tests by those two countries raised tensions in South
Asia and shook the foundation of the world's non-nuclear
proliferation movement.
	   ``The people in Hiroshima feel a strong rage against the nuclear
tests by the two nations, and worry about inducing a chain reaction
of nuclear competition,'' Hiraoka said.
	   India's ambassador Singh said the ceremony ``brings back to you
in very vivid form the horrors of atomic bombs and it renews one's
commitment to make every effort toward elimination of these
weapons.''
	   About 140,000 people were killed by Hiroshima's atomic bombing
as well as the firestorm and radiation that ensued in the western
city that was a major military center during World War II.
	   Three days after the Hiroshima attack, the United States dropped
a second atom bomb on Nagasaki, located on Japan's southern main
island of Kyushu, killing 70,000 people. Japan surrendered
unconditionally on Aug. 15, 1945.
	   Like the rest of Japan, Hiroshima rebuilt after the war. But the
remains of a prominent building _ the half-destroyed Atomic Dome _
was left to remind visitors of the massive destruction. Hiroshima,
690 kilometers (425 miles) southwest of Tokyo, is now a thriving
commercial center of 1.1 million people.
	   Today, many Japanese believe the atomic bombings of the two
cities were unjustified, despite Japan's war of aggression. But
U.S. wartime leaders defended the bombings as the only alternative
to a bloody invasion of mainland Japan, and many Americans still
hold that viewpoint.

Power cuts have become common in Myanmar
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   YANGON, Myanmar (AP) _ Power cuts have become a daily occurrence
in Yangon as Myanmar struggles with a lack of electricity because
of drought, short supplies of natural gas and an economic crisis.
	   An article in Thursday's state-run New Light of Myanmar said the
El Nino weather phenomenon, which has been blamed for droughts in
many parts of the world, was the cause.
	   The paper said that 95 percent of the country's electricity is
generated by five hydropower plants and eight plants using natural
gas.
	   Energy consumption has more than doubled since 1988, and Yangon
alone accounts for more than 50 percent of all electricity used in
the country. Most of the rest of Myanmar is relatively undeveloped
because of decades of socialist isolationism which ended in 1988.
	   Yangon residents now expect that electricity will only be
available in morning hours and again for several hours in the
evening each day.
	   Businesses and wealthy individuals have been buying their own
generators to deal with the situation.
	   The newspaper said that water levels at the hydroelectric
plants, all located in northern Myanmar, had dropped drastically.
Myanmar is also known as Burma.
	   One plant, the Kinda Electric Plant, was completely shut down in
June because of low water levels.
	   An insufficient supply of natural gas was reducing output at
power plants which rely on that energy source, the paper said.
	   Large reserves of natural gas have been found off the coast of
Myanmar, and a dlrs 1.2 billion pipeline has begun delivering that
gas to neighboring Thailand.
	   An extension of the pipeline to supply domestic power plants,
however, won't be completed for several more years.
	   Myanmar, like many Asian countries, is in the midst of an
economic crisis and has a small base of foreign reserves, making
purchasing gas for import purposes extremely difficult.

Japan's new gov't trumpets tax cuts, but some call for more
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By JOSEPH COLEMAN &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ Tax cuts. New spending. A massive bank bailout.
Japan's new government is plowing ahead this week with a
three-point program to patch up the ailing economy and win over the
markets.
	   Some wonder if that will be enough.
	   Prime Minister Keizo Obuchi, elected premier just last week by
Parliament, was to lay out the details of his plan in his first
policy speech before the legislature on Friday.
	   The speech was to contain the same points he made in his
campaign and since winning his post: 6 trillion yen (dlrs 41.7
billion) or more in tax cuts, 10 trillion yen (dlrs 69.4 billion)
in new spending and moves to clean up bad bank debts.
	   But with unemployment hitting a record high of 4.3 percent and
expected to go higher, some critics say pumping more money into the
system will not lead to the deep structural changes needed to build
an expanding economy.
	   ``Japan is taking the entirely wrong strategy,'' said Andrew
Shipley, chief economist at Schroders Securities (Japan). ``This
alone isn't going to kick-start growth.''
	   Instead, Shipley and other critics say Japan needs to create a
more dynamic system that allows weak companies _ particularly banks
_ to fall, leaving stronger institutions to power a recovery.
	   On that score, Obuchi's government has been less clear.
	   On Wednesday, the Cabinet approved two bills to clean up Japan's
massive bad debt problem _ one allowing the government to take over
insolvent banks, the other creating a special mediator to resolve
claims on properties used as collateral for bad loans.
	   Japanese financial institutions are suffocating under problem
loans estimated at more than 80 trillion yen (dlrs 556 billion),
mostly left over from the collapse of the real estate market in the
early 1990s.
	   The so-called ``bridge bank'' legislation, however, leaves key
details vague. While it will set up a system allowing the
government to act aggressively on the banks, it also allows enough
room for it to stop short of decisive action.
	   Even Obuchi's tax-cut plan _ which is in line with what many
economists are calling for to boost consumption _ has drawn fire
from some critics who fear it won't be accompanied by any real
changes in the tax code.
	   ``The plan only serves to delay a thorough reform of the tax
system,'' said the Nihon Keizai newspaper, Japan's top economics
daily, in an editorial on Thursday.
	   The government has been sweetening the plan this week. On
Wednesday, Finance Minister Kiichi Miyazawa said the tax cuts would
go well over the advertised 6 trillion yen (dlrs 41.7 billion).
	   He also said that Japan would shelve efforts to reign in its
ballooning budget deficit until the economy had perked up.
	   Markets, meanwhile, were still jittery about the new government.
The benchmark Nikkei Stock Average fell below 16,000 points on
Monday, and the yen fell to nearly an eight-year low earlier in the
week.

Iraq stops U.N. inspection team from carrying out duties
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with Iraqi newspaper editorial on sanctions, ADDS
background on U.S. stance, monitoring program, Butler to brief
Security Council on Thursday. INCORPORATES US-Iraq &QL; 
 &UR; By LEON BARKHO &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   BAGHDAD, Iraq (AP) _ Iraq stopped a team of U.N. inspectors
Thursday from carrying out searches for banned weapons in Baghdad,
an Iraqi government official said.
	   The move came a day after President Saddam Hussein froze
cooperation with U.N. inspectors to protest eight years of economic
sanctions. It was the most defiant Iraqi gesture since a crisis
over searches of presidential compounds was resolved in February,
averting a possible U.S. and British military strike.
	   The Iraqi decision could renew a confrontation with the United
States.
	   The United States had downplayed Saddam's declaration Wednesday
of a freeze on cooperation, saying it would wait to see what
happened when inspectors tried to continue their work.
	   The team was stopped when Iraqi escorts refused to accompany it
in its search Thursday, the official told The Associated Press.
Without the Iraqi escorts, U.N. teams are not able to conduct their
work.
	   In the past, the Iraqis have withheld escorts for the U.N. teams
as a way of impeding the inspections, which are usually carried out
as surprise visits.
	   The U.N. team in Baghdad was not allowed to conduct
``discussions with Iraqi authorities on arms or visits to sites or
searches for past weapons,'' the official said, speaking on
condition of anonymity.
	   The government, however, allowed monitoring of other sites
already inspected to continue. About 460 sites in Iraq have been
inspected and are being monitored. About 100 U.N. experts visit the
sites or use remote-controlled cameras and sensors.
	   Convoys of U.N. vehicles left the Canal Hotel on the eastern
outskirts of Baghdad followed by a similar number of cars with
Iraqi officials. No one interfered with their work.
	   ``Ongoing monitoring continues,'' Janet Sullivan, a U.N.
spokeswoman, told the AP.
	   The move Thursday followed a breakdown in talks between Iraq and
the United Nations over the inspections. Chief U.N. weapons
inspector Richard Butler left Baghdad on Monday.
	   Butler was to brief the Security Council later Thursday about
the impasse in negotiations. He said Iraqi Deputy Prime Minister
Tariq Aziz ended the talks when Butler refused to declare the
Iraqis in full compliance with the inspection program, the main
condition for lifting economic sanctions against Iraq.
	   On Wednesday, a government statement said Saddam had decided to
``completely suspend cooperation'' with the U.N. Special Commission
and the International Atomic Energy Agency.
	   It said monitoring activities would be allowed on the condition
that U.N. personnel ``carry out the monitoring strictly respecting
Iraq's sovereignty, security and its people's dignity.''
	   Government-run newspapers lauded Saddam's decision.
	   ``Our people will accept nothing less than the lifting of
sanctions,'' Al-Qadissiya newspaper said Thursday.
	   The sanctions were imposed after Iraq's 1990 invasion of Kuwait
and have crippled the economy by banning the free sale of oil, the
country's economic mainstay.
	   To lift them, inspectors must certify that Iraq's weapons of
mass destruction have been dismantled. Inspectors have been
searching, monitoring and accounting for Iraq's chemical and
biological arms, nuclear program and long-range missiles since
1991.

Russian miners allow coal to Sakhalin power plant
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ After a nearly two-week blockade, striking miners
on the eastern island of Sakhalin allowed a limited coal delivery
to reach a key regional power plant, a news report said Thursday.
	   The miners, who are demanding eight months worth of unpaid
wages, negotiated a truce Tuesday, agreeing to allow enough coal
through to keep the plant running. But some protesters refused to
leave the tracks for another day.
	   Late Wednesday night, the first delivery of some 1,500 tons of
coal loaded on 25 rail cars was allowed to go through, the
ITAR-Tass news agency reported.
	   Local authorities have accused the miners of causing serious
economic damage to the remote island because they have interrupted
preparations for winter, ITAR-Tass said.
	   Sakhalin, with a population of 650,000, is dependent on the
plant because it is not hooked up to Russia's national power grid.
Authorities have been rationing electricity, amid fears that the
plant would soon run out of fuel if coal deliveries did not arrive.
	   The strike is one of many protests for back wages in recent
months. But the strikes have rarely been coordinated, and miners'
pay is still arriving months late.
	   Millions of Russian workers receive their salaries months late
due to a chronic cycle of non-payments that has plagued the country
for years.

	   Zhivkov also held the record among his east European peers for
time in office _ 35 unbroken years from 1954 until his fall in the
anti-communist revolutions of 1989.
	   It was a longevity largely based on such absolute servility to
Moscow that Zhivkov once proposed that Bulgaria should merge with
the Soviet Union.
	   In this, too, he was exceptional. Even the leaders of other
Soviet satellites in eastern Europe occasionally demonstrated
varying degrees of independence, or simply were slow in switching
to the latest orientation of their Soviet masters.
	   Like others who rose to Communist heights after World War II,
Zhivkov came from a rural background, being born into a poor family
in Pravets, near Sofia, on Sept. 7, 1911.
	   He was part of a country generation that got its first education
after World War I had dissolved the Ottoman and Habsburg empires
that had ruled the Balkans for centuries, and one of many such
country boys whose learning led him to embrace revolution and
communism. Zhivkov joined the illegal Communist party in 1932.
	   His meteoric rise through the party ranks started in 1944, when
the Bulgarian Communists seized power with the backing of the Red
Army.
	   By 1948, Zhivkov was the influential party chief in the capital,
Sofia. In 1954, he became first secretary of Bulgaria's staunchly
Stalinist Communist Party.
	   Bulgaria's course meshed tightly with Moscow's until the late
1980s, when Soviet dogmatism eased under Mikhail Gorbachev _ a man
Zhivkov despised until his death for betraying the Stalinist cause.

Philippine president, defense chief say weren't informed of war

exercise

<TEXT>
	   MANILA, Philippines (AP) _ President Joseph Estrada and Defense
Secretary Orlando Mercado were not informed ahead of time of
live-fire war exercises with the U.S. Navy in the South China Sea,
Estrada said Thursday.
	   Estrada said Philippine navy and air force officials will be
asked to explain why they did not inform the country's top
officials of the 18-hour exercises held Wednesday outside
Philippine territorial waters.
	   ``They simply forgot to tell us,'' Estrada told reporters. He
said the exercises were scheduled during the time of his
predecessor, Fidel Ramos, who stepped down June 30.
	   An aide said Estrada apparently learned of the exercises several
hours after they began, when reporters sought his comment.
	   The exercises were held near Scarborough Shoal, which is claimed
by both China and the Philippines. They took place at a time when
the United States is seeking approval of an accord governing joint
exercises in the Philippines.
	   At least five ships and four aircraft joined the exercises,
which involved simulated air and naval attacks using cannon fire to
hit floating targets, Philippine navy spokesman commander Salvador
Cuba said.
	   Philippine officials say Scarborough, which lies 213 kilometers
(132 miles) off Zambales province, is within the country's 200-mile
exclusive economic zone. Chinese officials say the shoal has
belonged to China since ancient times.
	   China was not notified of the exercises because they were held
in international waters, said Cuba, adding it was not meant to
intimidate any country.
	   Cuba said the exercise was held outside the Philippines due to a
delay in the Philippine Senate's approval of the Visiting Forces
Agreement sought by the United States to provide American troops
with legal protections while on duty in the Philippines.
	   The United States halted joint exercises in the Philippines and
visits by U.S. military ships in December 1996, when the Manila
government ended a legal loophole that had shielded U.S. military
personnel from prosecution by the Philippines for crimes committed
here.
	   The Philippine Senate has not yet begun deliberations on the
accord, which was signed early this year by U.S. and Philippine
officials.
	   U.S. Defense Secretary William Cohen sought support for the
agreement in meetings with Estrada and other officials on Monday.
	   Critics say the accord limits the Philippine government's right
to prosecute American soldiers who commit crimes. It generally
gives the United States jurisdiction over soldiers who commit
crimes while on duty, and the Philippines jurisdiction over crimes
committed while off-duty.
	   Military ties with the United States have remained a sensitive
issue since a nationalist Philippine Senate forced the closure of
the last U.S. base in the country in 1992, ending close to a
century of American military presence in its former colony.

SOFIA: Stalinist cause.
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   In 1956, Zhivkov demonstrated his loyalty to Nikita Khrushchev
by siding with him in his condemnation of Joseph Stalin. With the
same ease, he allied with Leonid Breshnev and other Moscow
hardliners when they ousted Khrushchev in 1964.
	   In 1965, Zhivkov crushed an attempt by some Bulgarian Communists
to yank the country from its increasingly tight Soviet orbit,
declaring afterwards that he was ``with the Soviet Union for life
or death!''
	   Only years after Zhivkov himself was ousted did he admit that
``all Soviet leaders made mistakes.''
	   Remembering his once-regular meetings with Brezhnev, who ruled
the Kremlin from 1964-82, Zhivkov conceded the Soviet leader was
``too ill to hold serious conversations in his final years.''
	   ``It's clear he should have resigned,'' he acknowledged in an
interview with The Associated Press in March. ``He didn't
understand the real situation.''
	   The best Soviet leader among the many he worked with was
Khrushchev, he said. The worst: Mikhail Gorbachev, ``who betrayed
us and sold us'' by precipitating the collapse of an empire.
	   Zhivkov dealt mercilessly with dissent, imprisoning thousands of
people in the infamous Lovech and Skravena prison camps in the
1950s and 1960s.
	   ``He served the Soviet Union more ardently than the Soviet
leaders themselves did,'' wrote Georgi Markov, a defector working
for the BBC in London. In 1978, Markov was murdered _ most likely
by Bulgarian agents _ using a special umbrella to inject him with a
tiny poison vial.
	   For decades, the Bulgarian people feared ``Papa'' Zhivkov. For
most, who never met Zhivkov in person but knew him only from his
frequent photos and TV appearances, Zhivkov was known best for the
countless jokes created about him _ ventures that could land their
authors in jail.
	   This underground popular art form largely exploited Zhivkov's
rural simplicity and depicted him in embarrassing situations while
dealing with foreign partners.
	   Right up to his death, Bulgarians got laughs out of Zhivkov's
obsession with computers and other equipment he liked to say would
make his backward country ``the Japan of the Balkans.'' Example:
Zhivkov, opening an electronics facility: ``This year we open this
plant for semi-conductors. Let's work hard so that next year we can
open one for whole conductors.''
	   In the 1970s, the government-controlled propaganda machine
created a personality cult of Zhivkov mirroring that of Brezhnev in
the Soviet Union. An attempt to groom his daughter Ludmila as heir
ended with her death under unclear circumstances in 1981.
	   In the mid-1980s, as the country's debt-ridden economy started
to collapse, Zhivkov tried to whip up nationalist support by
cracking down on the Turkish minority, making them change their
names to Bulgarian-sounding ones. About 320,000 people eventually
fled to Turkey.
	   But with the advent of Gorbachev's reforms, Zhivkov's grip on
power started to slip. Unlike Gorbachev, Zhivkov could not blame
predecessors for past mistakes.
	   Abandoned by Gorbachev, who viewed old-style Stalinists as a
major embarrassment, Zhivkov was ousted as head of the communist
party in 1989 and replaced as president of Bulgaria.
	   Zhivkov was arrested the following year on charges of
misappropriating state funds. He was tried in 1991, found guilty
and sentenced to seven years in prison. But his failing health
meant he never went to jail, spending his final years under house
arrest while still being investigated for allegedly channeling
funds to foreign Communist movements, for inciting ethnic hatred
with his anti-Turkish policy and imprisoning dissenters.
	   In 1998, Zhivkov was suddenly reinstated as a member of the
Socialist party, which succeeded the Communists, and found himself
able to alarm rivals and inspire rousing ovations again.
	   ``Because of my age, I would prefer that people choose someone
who is younger,'' he told the AP this year. ``But they can't free
themselves from thinking about me. That's the psychology of the
people.''
	   He is survived by his son, Vladimir, who lives in Sofia. Details
of funeral plans were not immediately known.

	   He died in a hospital in the capital of Sofia late Wednesday,
the agency said. The cause of death was not immediately known, but
Zhivkov had suffered from various health problems for several
months.
	   Yugoslavia's Josip Broz Tito died in 1980, and Albania's Enver
Hoxha in 1985. Romania's Nicolae Ceausescu was executed in 1989.
Only Zhivkov outlasted them.
	   Zhivkov also held the record among his east European peers for
time in office: 35 uninterrupted years from 1954 until his fall in
the anti-communist revolutions of 1989.
	   It was a longevity largely based on such absolute servility to
Moscow that Zhivkov once proposed that Bulgaria should merge with
the Soviet Union.

Cambodia's ruling party says poll win a victory for nation
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: RECASTS and UPDATES with opposition complaint; edits thruout &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   PHNOM PENH, Cambodia (AP) _ A day after official results were
announced for Cambodia's recent election, opposition parties
stepped up their attacks on the legitimacy of the electoral
process.
	   Strongman Hun Sen's Cambodian People's Party emerged as the
clear winner when the long-delayed complete preliminary results
from last week's parliamentary election were announced Wednesday.
	   Pending recounts of some votes, the ruling party appeared to
have won a slight majority in the 122-seat National Assembly, but
not the two-thirds majority needed to form a government on its own.
	   Opposition parties, which have already protested alleged fraud
in voting and ballot-counting, on Thursday spotlighted the
controversial formula the official National Election Committee will
use to allocate parliamentary seats to the winners.
	   FUNCINPEC party leader Prince Norodom Ranariddh and his ally Sam
Rainsy issued a statement describing as ``illegal'' a
little-noticed change in the formula before the election.
	   The change favors the party getting the most votes in any
particular province. In practice, it worked to the advantage of the
ruling party, because under the original formula it would have won
59 seats, less than a majority.
	   Under the new formula, the CPP is slated to take 64
parliamentary seats, FUNCINPEC 43 seats, and its ally the Sam
Rainsy Party 15 seats.
	   ``We will not take part in any session of the National Assembly
that includes alleged members who owe their seats to an illegal
formula at the expense of legally elected members of the National
Assembly,'' said a statement signed by Ranariddh and Sam Rainsy.
	   The two party leaders had already threatened to boycott the
National Assembly unless their concerns about alleged
irregularities were met, a move which would block the formation of
a new government.
	   The election committee has insisted the formula change was legal
and aboveboard, but has so far been unable to provide the reason
for doing it.
	   The Cambodian People's Party said Thursday that its victory at
the polls was a victory for the nation and for pluralistic
democracy, and called on the opposition to join in the new
government.
	   ``This victory is not a victory exclusively for the CPP but is
also of the entire nation which is on its path of liberal
democracy,'' the party said, promising to work hard to build up the
economy and social development.
	   A coalition with other parties which won seats in the elections
is the ''best way to guarantee national stability and to build
trust among the Cambodian people toward the government,'' it said
in a statement broadcast on a television station it controls.
	   Promising to bring peace and stability to Cambodia after winning
the election, the ruling party said it was confident the country
was moving in the right direction.
	   ``The CPP would like to appeal to all compatriots of all walks
of life throughout the nation and outside the country, to remain
calm and be united ... in order to build a prosperous future.''
	   The election on July 26 came one year after Hun Sen ousted
Prince Norodom Ranariddh as his co-prime minister in a violent coup
d'etat, shattering a tense dual premiership formed after
U.N.-sponsored polls in 1993.
	   Hun Sen hoped that new election would restore his legitimacy in
the eyes of the international community and foreign aid lost after
his takeover.

Dollar higher in Tokyo, Japanese stocks mixed
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with closing stock prices, afternoon dollar and bond
rates &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ The U.S. dollar was higher against the yen in Tokyo
trading Thursday afternoon following an overnight rebound on Wall
Street. Japanese stocks fell.
	   The dollar bought 144.75 yen, up 0.94 yen from late Wednesday in
Tokyo and above its late New York rate of 143.86 yen overnight.
	   Market players bought up dollars against the yen to cover short
positions after the U.S. currency's slide stopped overnight. The
dollar had fallen against the yen over the last few days after top
government officials outlined more details of a proposed 6 trillion
yen (dlrs 41 billion) tax cut plan.
	   ``We've been hearing about the tax cuts for a while, and that
helped the yen, but it had to end sometime,'' said Kazuteru
Hasegawa, head of foreign exchange trading at Bank of America in
Tokyo.
	   The dollar also got a boost following an overnight rise on Wall
Street, where the Dow Jones industrial average gained 59.47 points
Wednesday, snapping back from its 299-point loss Tuesday.
	   Traders said the U.S. currency isn't likely to move much before
a policy speech from Japanese Prime Minister Keizo Obuchi on
Friday.
	   In the speech, investors and traders will be looking for
indications Japan's new government will move aggressively to get
its sagging economy back on track.
	   On the Tokyo stock exchange, stocks sank for the fourth straight
day in line with the falling yen.
	   The 225-issue Nikkei Stock Average fell 115.94 points, or 0.72
percent, to close at 15,876.22 points. On Wednesday, the Nikkei
index closed down 31.42 points, or 0.20 percent.
	   A weaker yen hurts the stock market because it makes Japanese
shares less attractive to foreign investors.
	   Worries that the government may have trouble passing a bill
designed to clean up banks' bad loans weighed on bank shares
	   ``There are worries that the (cleanup) plans will be delayed,''
said Naoki Takahashi, manager at Marusan Securities.
	   Traders said there is a possibility that opposition parties may
block passage of the bills during the current parliamentary session
ending in October to force newly elected Prime Minister Keizo
Obuchi to call lower house elections.
	   The broader Tokyo Stock Price Index of all issues listed on the
first section was down 8.69 points, or 0.70 percent, to 1,227.09
points. The TOPIX closed down 1.17 points, or 0.09 percent, the day
before.
	   Trading on the exchange's main section was estimated at 382
million shares, up slightly from 363.67 million shares Wednesday.
	   Declines outnumbered advances 689 to 432, while 165 issues were
unchanged.
	   The yield on the benchmark No. 182 10-year Japanese government
bond fell to 1.220 percent from Wednesday's finish of 1.225
percent, driving its price up to 111.64 yen from 111.61 yen.

	   In this, too, he was exceptional. Even the leaders of other
Soviet satellites in eastern Europe occasionally demonstrated
varying degrees of independence, or simply were slow in switching
to the latest orientation of their Soviet masters.
	   Like others who rose to Communist heights after World War II,
Zhivkov came from a rural background, being born into a poor family
in Pravets, near Sofia, on Sept. 7, 1911.
	   He was part of a country generation that got its first education
after World War I had dissolved the Ottoman and Habsburg empires
that had ruled the Balkans for centuries, and one of many such
country boys whose learning led him to embrace revolution and
communism. Zhivkov joined the illegal Communist party in 1932.
	   His meteoric rise through the party ranks started in 1944, when
the Bulgarian Communists seized power with the backing of the Red
Army.
	   By 1948, Zhivkov was the influential party chief in the capital,
Sofia. In 1954, he became first secretary of Bulgaria's staunchly
Stalinist Communist Party.
	   Bulgaria's course meshed tightly with Moscow's until the late
1980s, when Soviet dogmatism eased under Mikhail Gorbachev _ a man
Zhivkov despised for betraying the orthodox Communist cause.

<TEXT>
	   In 1956, Zhivkov demonstrated his loyalty to Nikita Khrushchev
by siding with him in his condemnation of Josef Stalin. With the
same ease, he allied with Leonid Brezhnev and other Moscow
hardliners when they ousted Khrushchev in 1964.
	   In 1965, Zhivkov crushed an attempt by some Bulgarian Communists
to yank the country from its increasingly tight Soviet orbit,
declaring afterwards that he was ``with the Soviet Union for life
or death!''
	   Only years after Zhivkov himself was ousted did he admit that
``all Soviet leaders made mistakes.''
	   Remembering his once-regular meetings with Brezhnev, who ruled
the Kremlin from 1964-82, Zhivkov conceded the Soviet leader was
``too ill to hold serious conversations in his final years.''
	   ``It's clear he should have resigned,'' he acknowledged in an
interview with The Associated Press in March. ``He didn't
understand the real situation.''
	   The best Soviet leader among the many he worked with was
Khrushchev, he said. The worst: Gorbachev, ``who betrayed us and
sold us'' by precipitating the collapse of an empire.
	   Zhivkov dealt mercilessly with dissent, imprisoning thousands of
people in the infamous Lovech and Skravena prison camps in the
1950s and 1960s.
	   ``He served the Soviet Union more ardently than the Soviet
leaders themselves did,'' wrote Georgi Markov, a defector working
for the BBC in London. In 1978, Markov was murdered _ most likely
by Bulgarian agents _ using a special umbrella to inject him with a
tiny poison vial.
	   For decades, the Bulgarian people feared ``Papa'' Zhivkov. For
most, who never met Zhivkov in person but knew him only from his
frequent photos and TV appearances, Zhivkov was known best for the
countless jokes created about him _ ventures that could land their
authors in jail.
	   This underground popular art form largely exploited Zhivkov's
rural simplicity and depicted him in embarrassing situations while
dealing with foreign partners.
	   In the 1970s, the government-controlled propaganda machine
created a personality cult of Zhivkov mirroring that of Brezhnev in
the Soviet Union. An attempt to groom his daughter Ludmila as heir
ended with her death under unclear circumstances in 1981.
	   In the mid-1980s, as the country's debt-ridden economy started
to collapse, Zhivkov tried to whip up nationalist support by
cracking down on the Turkish minority, making them change their
names to Bulgarian-sounding ones. About 320,000 people eventually
fled to Turkey.
	   With the advent of Gorbachev's reforms, Zhivkov's grip on power
started to slip. Unlike Gorbachev, Zhivkov could not blame
predecessors for past mistakes.
	   Abandoned by Gorbachev, who viewed old-style Stalinists as a
major embarrassment, Zhivkov was ousted as head of the communist
party in 1989 and replaced as president of Bulgaria.
	   Zhivkov was arrested the following year on charges of
misappropriating state funds. He was tried in 1991, found guilty
and sentenced to seven years in prison. But his failing health
meant he never went to jail, spending his final years under house
arrest while still being investigated for allegedly channeling
funds to foreign Communist movements, for inciting ethnic hatred
with his anti-Turkish policy and imprisoning dissenters.
	   In 1998, Zhivkov was suddenly reinstated as a member of the
Socialist party, which succeeded the Communists, and found himself
able to alarm rivals and inspire rousing ovations again.
	   ``Because of my age, I would prefer that people choose someone
who is younger,'' he told the AP this year. ``But they can't free
themselves from thinking about me. That's the psychology of the
people.''
	   He is survived by his son, Vladimir, who lives in Sofia. Details
of funeral plans were not immediately known.

<TEXT>
	   SEOUL, South Korea (AP) _ Torrential rains triggered floods and
landslides in Seoul and surrounding provinces Thursday, killing at
least 40 people, leaving 20 missing and submerging thousands of
homes.
	   Disaster relief headquarters urged 200,000 people in low-lying
districts in and near the capital to evacuate as tributaries of the
Han River, which bisects the city, threatened to overflow.
	   Suburbs north and west of Seoul were submerged in waist-deep
water. Rescuers used rubber boats to help move citizens to higher
ground. A satellite city north of Seoul was completely cut off,
with roads swept away, a subway line flooded and telephone poles
downed.
	   Four people were killed when a restaurant in an amusement park
north of Seoul collapsed under a mudslide. The Defense Ministry
said at least nine soldiers were killed by a landslide while
working to restore damaged communications lines.
	   Four people were killed when a flash flood slammed into their
homes in a valley near Uijongbu, north of Seoul. A 49-year-old
woman was electrocuted in a nearby city.
	   Firefighter Chan Mu-won, 28, was swept away after he waded into
swirling floodwaters and helped two people to safety. His body was
found six hours later.
	   Thursday's deaths brought to more than 100 the number of dead
from heavy rains that have lashed South Korea since last weekend.
Flash floods raced down streams and ravines in a national park in
the southern part of the nation over the weekend, leaving 64 people
dead and 32 missing.
	   U.S. soldiers near the border with communist North Korea were
trying to recover several boxcar-size containers of small arms
ammunition swept away by rains, said Jim Coles, spokesman of the
U.S. military command.
	   An unknown number of land mines were uprooted and swept away
along a portion of the demilitarized zone separating South and
North Korea. The region was declared off limits. As many as a
million mines are believed strewn along the DMZ as a military
deterrent.
	   Up to 61 centimeters (24 inches) of rain poured down in Seoul
and its suburbs between late Wednesday and Thursday morning,
submerging 5,800 homes and other buildings and leaving at least
3,000 people homeless.
	   The government's Disaster Relief Headquarters said the number of
missing and dead could rise as communications were restored to the
stricken areas.
	   With weather forecasters predicting more rain, long lines of
people trekked along railway lines to higher ground. Large
stretches of green rice fields disappeared under brown floodwater.
	   ``We are worried about the water levels in the Han River. But
the imminent danger seems to be subsiding because water levels in
its tributaries are receding,'' said Chan Jong-hwan, a relief
organizer.
	   In Seoul, subway service was disrupted during busy commuting
hours when water submerged tracks.
	   President Kim Dae-jung ordered the military to send soldiers and
equipment to step up relief efforts.
	   The downpours mostly affected Seoul and regions near the North
Korean border, 60 kilometers (37 miles) north of the capital.
Weather officials could not immediately tell how much rain fell in
North Korea, where famine is spreading after years of floods,
droughts and other bad weather.
	   On Wednesday night, a Korean Air passenger plane skidded off a
rain-slicked runway while landing at Seoul's Kimpo International
Airport, injuring 22 people.
	   The flight, carrying 397 passengers from Tokyo's Narita airport,
bounced and skidded before coming to a halt in a meadow. One of the
airport's two runways remained closed Thursday, forcing delays in
landings.

Iraq stops inspection team from carrying out duties

background on monitoring. Incorporates BC-US-Iraq. &QL;

	   BAGHDAD, Iraq (AP) _ Setting the stage for another
confrontation, Iraq stopped a team of U.N. inspectors Thursday from
carrying out searches in Baghdad, an Iraqi official said.
	   The move came a day after President Saddam Hussein froze
cooperation with inspectors to protest eight years of economic
sanctions. It was the most defiant Iraqi gesture since a crisis
over searches of presidential compounds was resolved in February,
averting a possible U.S. and British military strike.
	   The decision will likely return the issue of U.N. sanctions to
international attention and could renew a confrontation with the
United States. After Saddam's announcement, U.S. officials had said
they would wait to see what happened when inspectors tried to work.
	   The U.N. team was stopped when Iraqi escorts refused to
accompany it in its search Thursday in Baghdad, the official said.
Without them, U.N. teams are not able to conduct their work.
	   In the past, the Iraqis have withheld escorts for the U.N. teams
as a way of impeding the inspections, which are usually carried out
as surprise visits.
	   The U.N. team was not allowed to conduct ``discussions with
Iraqi authorities on arms or visits to sites or searches for past
weapons,'' the official told The Associated Press.
	   The government, however, allowed monitoring of other sites
already inspected to continue. About 460 sites in Iraq have been
inspected and are under monitoring. About 100 U.N. experts visit
the sites or use remote-controlled cameras and sensors as part of a
surveillance system set up in 1994.
	   Convoys of U.N. vehicles left the Canal Hotel on the eastern
outskirts of Baghdad followed by a similar number of cars of Iraqi
officials. No one interfered with their work.
	   ``Ongoing monitoring continues,'' Janet Sullivan, a U.N.
spokeswoman, told the AP.
	   The move Thursday followed a breakdown in talks between Iraq and
the United Nations over the inspections. Chief U.N. weapons
inspector Richard Butler left Baghdad on Monday and was scheduled
to brief the U.N. Security Council later Thursday.
	   The government statement Wednesday said Saddam had decided to
``completely suspend cooperation'' with the U.N. Special Commission
and the International Atomic Energy Agency.
	   It said monitoring activities would be allowed on the condition
that U.N. ``personnel carry out the monitoring strictly respecting
Iraq's sovereignty, security and its people's dignity.''
	   Government-run newspapers lauded Saddam's decision.
	   ``Our people will accept nothing less than the lifting of
sanctions,'' Al-Qadissiya newspaper said Thursday.
	   The sanctions were imposed after Iraq's 1990 invasion of Kuwait
and have crippled the economy by banning the free sale of oil, the
country's economic mainstay.
	   To lift them, inspectors must certify Iraq's weapons of mass
destruction have been dismantled. Inspectors have been searching,
monitoring and accounting for Iraq's chemical and biological arms,
nuclear program and long-range missiles since 1991.

Anglican bishops declare homosexuality `incompatible with

 &UR; Eds: RECASTS lead to focus on issue of homosexuality; EDITS
throughout to tighten. &QL; 
 &UR; By ROBERT BARR &QC;

<TEXT>
	   CANTERBURY, England (AP) _ With African and Asian bishops in the
forefront of a traditionalist push, an Anglican conference has
declared homosexuality to be ``incompatible with Scripture'' and
said homosexuals should not be ordained as priests.
	   The bishops also strongly affirmed traditional teaching that sex
is only for married couples and prescribed abstinence for everyone
else.
	   The resolution on homosexuality was adopted Wednesday by a vote
of 526 to 70, with 45 bishops abstaining. It was part of the
Lambeth Conference, a once-a-decade gathering of the main
consultative body for the world's 70 million Anglicans.
	   The vote was a defeat for liberal bishops, notably those in
Europe and the United States, and a victory for traditionalists,
including many from churches established by English missionaries
during colonial times.
	   ``Homosexual practice is nowhere sanctioned in Scripture. ... It
is condemned in both Old and New Testaments as an immoral act, and
therefore a sin,'' said the Right Rev. Eustace Kamanyire, Bishop of
Ruwenzori in Uganda.
	   West African bishops had backed an even stronger motion that
condemns homosexuality ``as a sin which could only be adopted by
the church if it wanted to commit evangelical suicide.''
	   Such language drew a protest from the Right Rev. Catherine
Roskam of New York, who said it would harm the church's work in
U.S. cities. ``To condemn (homosexuality) in the form it has been
condemned is evangelical suicide in my region,'' she said.
	   The Right Rev. John Spong, bishop of Newark, New Jersey, and a
vigorous advocate for homosexuals, declared that the debate itself
was ``a great victory.''
	   ``This issue is now at the front and center of the Anglican
Communion and at the next conference I predict there will be openly
out gay bishops,'' Spong told reporters after the vote.
	   Spong has been one of the most controversial figures at the
Lambeth Conference. The conference can only debate and advise, and
the national churches are free to go their own way _ as they have
done on the divisive question of women priests. Eleven women
bishops attended the conference.
	   The Anglican Communion includes the Church of England, the
Scottish Episcopal Church, the Anglican Church of Canada and, in
the United States, the Protestant Episcopal Church.
	   Many American and English bishops welcomed the conference's
stand.
	   ``The willingness of so many American church leaders to try to
legitimize homosexual behavior has foisted this difficult
discussion on the worldwide church,'' said the Right Rev. James
Stanton, bishop of Dallas. ``It has sapped our energy from urgent
tasks such as evangelism and justice for the poorest of the poor.''
	   ``I stand wholeheartedly with traditional Anglican orthodoxy,
(and) see no room in the Holy Scripture or the entire Christian
tradition for any sexual activity outside of matrimony,'' said the
Most Rev. George Carey, the Archbishop of Canterbury and the
conference's leader.
	   The Right Rev. Duncan Buchanan, the Bishop of Johannesburg,
South Africa, said this was not likely to be the last word on the
issue.
	   Ten years ago, he said, the conference refused to even consider
a resolution on homosexuality. Just last month, he said, there was
little support for promising to listen to homosexuals _ a pledge
included in the motion adopted Wednesday.
	   ``One of the nice things about being an Anglican is that you can
both doubt and disagree,'' Buchanan said.

Flood workers recover bodies as another dike bursts in China

	   JIAYU, China (AP) _ While rescue workers pulled bodies from
floodwaters after a levee along China's Yangtze River collapsed,
another dike downstream burst, releasing a torrent of water that
engulfed thousands of homes, officials said Thursday.
	   Collapsing levees along the Yangtze, the world's third-longest
river, are the worst nightmare for disaster workers who have
struggled for weeks to hold back floodwaters at levels unseen since
floods in 1954 killed more than 30,000 people.
	   So far, at least 1,300 people have been reported killed this
year in floods caused by rains that fell earlier and heavier than
usual. The floods have displaced millions of people and inundated
swathes of farmland along the Yangtze.
	   Central Hubei province, the area worst hit by the flooding,
declared a state of emergency Thursday, the official Xinhua News
Agency reported. It said that with water levels expected to rise
further, provincial authorities had issued a ``do or die'' order to
local residents to help safeguard major cities and levees.
	   On Wednesday, a levee that protected 35,000 people in Jiujiang
city, along the Yangtze in south China, gave way. Weaving between
submerged trees and power lines, rescuers in speedboats rushed to
pluck people from the water, the official newspaper Beijing Youth
Daily said.
	   Fears that the levee might collapse prompted officials to move
20,000 people out of area before it ruptured, and another 14,000
people were moved from their homes after the breach, said a
Jiujiang Flood Prevention official, who gave his surname, Xu.
	   As of Thursday, there were no reports of deaths or injuries, he
said.
	   But the bodies of 13 people were recovered in Jiayu, a county
upstream where a levee collapsed Saturday, the official Hubei Daily
reported. Nineteen soldiers who were swept away when the dike burst
were missing, the official China Daily added.
	   Police turned foreign reporters away from Paizhou, one of two
towns in Jiayu hit by the flood. Military trucks bearing Red Cross
flags bore down on the area carrying bags of supplies.
	   After weeks of rain, dikes along the Yangtze are saturated and
threaten to give way at any time in thousands of places. Millions
of residents and soldiers patrol around the clock, on the lookout
for cracks or signs of weakness. Neck deep in water, they plug
holes and shore up the levees with sandbags, stones and wooden
stakes in anticipation of several more weeks of battle with the
river.
	   Another flood crest, the fourth this year, was rushing down the
Yangtze from Chongqing in Sichuan province, promising more high
waters in the days ahead.
	   But Tropical Storm Otto, which officials had feared could
further strain waterlogged dikes, weakened after it hit China's
southeast coast Wednesday and was no longer powerful enough to be
classed as a storm, the State Meteorological Bureau said Thursday.
Fujian, the province where Otto landed after killing one person on
Taiwan, reported no casualties or losses.
	   In Jiayu, the dike burst and waters poured into fields with
terrifying speed, according to survivors interviewed by AP
Television.
	   A grandmother and lifelong resident, Lin Fengying, estimated
hundreds were swept away. A Hong Kong-based human rights group
claimed Tuesday that more than 1,000 people were believed to be
missing.
	   Jiayu officials said the majority of the 57,000 people who were
flooded out had been resettled, and the government was providing
food and water.
	   A farmer who only gave his surname, Cong, blamed ineffectual
local officials for neglecting the dike and for responding slowly
when disaster struck.
	   ``This was all because of slack vigilance on the part of
officials,'' said Cong.
	   A few days before collapsing, the Jiayu embankment had sprung a
leak that was never plugged effectively, the Yangcheng Evening News
reported.

<TEXT>
	   SOFIA, Bulgaria (AP) _ Todor Zhivkov, Bulgaria's former
long-time Communist dictator and the last surviving Soviet-bloc
Stalinist leader, died in a Sofia hospital, officials said
Thursday. He was 86.
	   Zhivkov died Wednesday night in Losenets Hospital, where he had
fallen into a coma after being hospitalized July 8 with a
respiratory virus infection that led to severe brain
arterosklerosis, hospital director Todor Gerassimov was quoted as
saying. He also had suffered from diabetes for the past year.
	   Bulgarian President Petar Stoyanov, a reformer, expressed his
condolences to Zhivkov's family but said in a public statement that
Zhivkov oversaw ``one of the darkest periods of recent Bulgarian
history.''
	   ``Eight million Bulgarians lived during that long period with
their work, dreams and illusions, but also in fear and political
repressions,'' Stoyanov said. ``With the death of Todor Zhivkov the
era of Bulgarian communism is finally ending.''
	   Zhivkov outlived both his former Kremlin bosses and other Balkan
country boys who rose to be Stalinist dictators.
	   Yugoslavia's Josip Broz Tito died in 1980, and Albania's Enver
Hoxha in 1985. Romania's Nicolae Ceausescu was executed in 1989.
	   Zhivkov also held the record among his east European peers for
time in office _ 35 unbroken years from 1954 until his fall in the
anti-communist revolutions of 1989.
	   It was a longevity largely based on such absolute servility to
Moscow that Zhivkov once proposed that Bulgaria should merge with
the Soviet Union.
	   In this, too, he was exceptional. Even the leaders of other
Soviet satellites in eastern Europe occasionally demonstrated
varying degrees of independence, or simply were slow in switching
to the latest orientation of their Soviet masters.
	   Like others who rose to Communist heights after World War II,
Zhivkov came from a rural background, being born into a poor family
in Pravets, near Sofia, on Sept. 7, 1911.
	   He was part of a country generation that got its first education
after World War I had dissolved the Ottoman and Habsburg empires
that had ruled the Balkans for centuries, and one of many such
rural products whose learning led him to embrace revolution and
communism. Zhivkov joined the illegal Communist party in 1932.
	   His meteoric rise through the party ranks started in 1944, when
the Bulgarian Communists seized power with the backing of the Red
Army.
	   By 1948, Zhivkov was the influential party chief in the capital,
Sofia. In 1954, he became first secretary of Bulgaria's staunchly
Stalinist Communist Party.
	   Bulgaria's course meshed tightly with Moscow's until the late
1980s, when Soviet dogmatism eased under Mikhail Gorbachev _ a man
Zhivkov despised until his death for betraying the hard-line
communist cause.
	   In 1956, Zhivkov demonstrated his loyalty to Nikita Khrushchev
by siding with him in his condemnation of Josef Stalin. With the
same ease, he allied with Leonid Brezhnev and other Moscow
hardliners when they ousted Khrushchev in 1964.
	   In 1965, Zhivkov crushed an attempt by some Bulgarian Communists
to yank the country from its increasingly tight Soviet orbit,
declaring afterwards that he was ``with the Soviet Union for life
or death!''
	   Only years after Zhivkov himself was ousted did he admit that
``all Soviet leaders made mistakes.''
	   Remembering his once-regular meetings with Brezhnev, who ruled
the Kremlin from 1964-82, Zhivkov conceded the Soviet leader was
``too ill to hold serious conversations in his final years.''
	   ``It's clear he should have resigned,'' he acknowledged in an
interview with The Associated Press in March. ``He didn't
understand the real situation.''
	   The best Soviet leader among the many he worked with was
Khrushchev, he said. The worst: Mikhail Gorbachev, ``who betrayed
us and sold us'' by precipitating the collapse of an empire.
	   Zhivkov dealt mercilessly with dissent, imprisoning thousands of
people in the infamous Lovech and Skravena prison camps in the
1950s and 1960s.
	   ``He served the Soviet Union more ardently than the Soviet
leaders themselves did,'' wrote Georgi Markov, a defector working
for the BBC in London. In 1978, Markov was murdered _ most likely
by Bulgarian agents _ using a special umbrella to inject him with a
tiny poison vial.
	   For decades, the Bulgarian people feared ``Papa'' Zhivkov. For
most, who never met Zhivkov in person but knew him only from his
frequent photos and TV appearances, Zhivkov was known best for the
countless jokes created about him _ ventures that could land their
authors in jail.
	   This underground popular art form largely exploited Zhivkov's
rural simplicity and depicted him in embarrassing situations while
dealing with foreign partners.
	   In the 1970s, the government-controlled propaganda machine
created a personality cult of Zhivkov mirroring that of Brezhnev in
the Soviet Union. An attempt to groom his daughter Ludmila as heir
ended with her death under unclear circumstances in 1981.
	   In the mid-1980s, as the country's debt-ridden economy started
to collapse, Zhivkov tried to whip up nationalist support by
cracking down on the Turkish minority, making them change their
names to Bulgarian-sounding ones. About 320,000 people eventually
fled to Turkey.
	   But with the advent of Gorbachev's reforms, Zhivkov's grip on
power started to slip. Unlike Gorbachev, Zhivkov could not blame
predecessors for past mistakes.
	   Abandoned by Gorbachev, who viewed old-style Stalinists as a
major embarrassment, Zhivkov was ousted as head of the communist
party in 1989 and replaced as president of Bulgaria.
	   Zhivkov was arrested the following year on charges of
misappropriating state funds. He was tried in 1991, found guilty
and sentenced to seven years in prison. But his failing health
meant he never went to jail, spending his final years under house
arrest while still being investigated for allegedly channeling
funds to foreign Communist movements, for inciting ethnic hatred
with his anti-Turkish policy and imprisoning dissenters.
	   In 1998, Zhivkov was suddenly reinstated as a member of the
Socialist party, which succeeded the Communists, and found himself
able to alarm rivals and inspire rousing ovations again.
	   ``Because of my age, I would prefer that people choose someone
who is younger,'' he told the AP this year. ``But they can't free
themselves from thinking about me. That's the psychology of the
people.''
	   He is survived by his son, Vladimir, who lives in Sofia. Details
of funeral plans were not immediately known.

Former British trader Leeson has colon cancer in Singapore prison
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES throughout with fresh quotes from embassy &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   SINGAPORE (AP) _ Nick Leeson, the imprisoned former securities
trader whose futures dealing destroyed Britain's Barings bank, has
been hospitalized with colon cancer, the British High Commission
said Thursday.
	   ``We can confirm that he has cancer of the colon ... and is
currently in the Changi Prison hospital,'' a spokeswoman for the
British High Commission told The Associated Press.
	   She said Leeson was seriously ill and was being regularly
visited by British consular staff.
	   But she denied British news media reports that the high
commission was pressing for his transfer to another hospital or
early release from his 6 1/2-year prison sentence for fraud.
	   ``That would be up to his lawyer,'' she said.
	   The Daily Mail in London quoted Leeson's father, William, as
saying, ``We are waiting anxiously for more news.''
	   Leeson, 31, lost dlrs 1.38 billion speculating on Asian stock
markets, causing the 1995 collapse of Britain's oldest merchant
bank, Barings. He went to prison in December 1995.
	   His wife, Lisa, divorced him after he wrote a prison
autobiography revealing that he had committed adultery. She was
planning to remarry this weekend, the Daily Mail reported.
	   Changi Prison and officials and doctors refused to make any
comment about Leeson.

Dow effect short-lived, Asian markets resume downward spiral
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with afternoon quotes; poor earnings report in Hong
Kong, weaker yen &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   HONG KONG (AP) _ Wall Street's overnight recovery provided a
brief respite for Asia Thursday, but financial markets only paused
before continuing their downward spiral.
	   The Dow Jones average fell almost 300 points on Tuesday, and was
in negative numbers most of Wednesday before rebounding at the
close for a gain of 60 points.
	   Most Asian markets opened quietly Thursday, and many initially
followed the Dow, posting small gains. The good feelings wore off
quickly because of local worries and the renewed weakness of the
Japanese yen against the dollar.
	   In Hong Kong, the earnings report for conglomerate Swire Pacific
added to the string of bad news on corporate earnings and the gross
domestic product that drove the market down almost 6 percent in the
first three days of the week.
	   Swire Pacific reported a 39 percent decline in profits for the
first half of the year. By afternoon, the Hang Seng index was down
another 142 points to 7,324.
	   Hong Kong markets also were spooked by fears of an attack by
currency speculators on the Hong Kong dollar, which forced up
interbank interest rates.
	   In Tokyo, the Nikkei index was flat in early trading, but fell
more sharply as the day went on, closing down almost 116 points, or
0.72 percent, at 15,876.22.
	   Traders in Tokyo had noted a tentative reversal of recent
sentiments. Instead of pessimism about Japan's ability to dig
itself out of its troubles, there was hope that Prime Minister
Keizo Obuchi would announce large tax cuts to encourage growth. And
the prevailing optimism about the U.S. economy was replaced by a
wait-and-see attitude.
	   However, the dollar climbed against the yen again Thursday, and
that helped drive share prices down. A stronger dollar increases
the yen value of the banks' loan assets overseas and affects their
capital adequacy ratios.
	   Across much of Asia, early gains were short-lived.
	   Taiwan shares closed lower for the 10th day in a row because of
fears that the local economy may be slowing.
	   The Manila market, which had hit a five-year low in previous
days, rebounded Wednesday. On Thursday, investors cashed in on some
of those gains, driving the market down to a new low. The
Philippine Stock Exchange Index fell 43.86 points, or 2.9 percent,
to 1,480.89.
	   South Korea's benchmark Korea Composite Stock Price Index closed
down 2.26 points at 320.57 on a series of negative factors
including fears about the U.S. economy, the yen, and the
possibility that the Chinese currency will be devalued.

Autopsy on Taiwanese politician finds pin pricks
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BEIJING (AP) _ Initial autopsy results appear to substantiate
reports that a Taiwanese politician found dead in northern China
was killed by a lethal drug overdose, official media reported
Thursday.
	   Doctors performing an autopsy on Lin Ti-chuan, a city council
deputy from southern Kaohsiung, discovered five pin pricks in her
right arm, the China Daily reported. No other external wounds were
found, but results of laboratory tests of blood and tissue samples
taken from her will not be available for several days, the official
paper said.
	   Lin was found dead at a hospital in the northeastern town of
Haicheng July 29, two days after she was reportedly kidnapped along
with her Taiwanese boyfriend, who escaped his captors and alerted
police.
	   Her remains were to be returned to Kaohsiung Thursday night.
	   Chinese police say the crime was the result of a commercial
dispute, and more than 200 detectives have been mobilized to hunt
for three men suspected in the case. The suspects include a manager
of a trading company reportedly owed U.S. dlrs 700,000 by Lin's
boyfriend.
	   The case has provoked anger in Taiwan over a perceived
callousness by Chinese officials toward the safety of Taiwanese in
China, where many have business dealings. Such incidents put a
damper on Taiwanese tourism in China, and Taiwanese politicians
have already called for a suspension of new investment in China.
	   Both Taipei and Beijing have sought to prevent the incident from
slowing gradual movement toward a renewal of their dialogue, broken
off in 1995.
	   Mindful of the Taiwanese public's sensitivity over such
incidents, China's state media have portrayed officials as anxious
to accommodate Lin's family. Facilities have been provided for
traditional Buddhist mourning ceremonies, and officials have agreed
to return her remains to Kaohsiung before sunset according to
Taiwanese custom, the official Xinhua News Agency reported.
	   The Haicheng business community has contributed 85,000 yuan
(U.S. dlrs 10,240) toward the cost of returning Lin's remains,
Xinhua said.

	   SOFIA, Bulgaria (AP) _ Todor Zhivkov, Bulgaria's former
long-time Communist dictator and the last surviving Soviet-bloc
Stalinist leader, died in a Sofia hospital, officials said
Thursday. He was 86.
	   Zhivkov died Wednesday night in Losenets Hospital, where he had
fallen into a coma after being hospitalized July 8 with a
respiratory virus infection that led to severe brain
arterosklerosis, hospital director Todor Gerassimov was quoted as
saying. He also had suffered from diabetes for the past year.
	   Bulgarian President Petar Stoyanov, a reformer, expressed his
condolences to Zhivkov's family but said in a public statement that
Zhivkov oversaw ``one of the darkest periods of recent Bulgarian
history.''
	   ``Eight million Bulgarians lived during that long period with
their work, dreams and illusions, but also in fear and political
repressions,'' Stoyanov said. ``With the death of Todor Zhivkov,
the era of Bulgarian communism is finally ending.''
	   Zhivkov outlived both his former Kremlin bosses and other Balkan
communist dictators.
	   Yugoslavia's Josip Broz Tito died in 1980, and Albania's Enver
Hoxha in 1985. Romania's Nicolae Ceausescu was executed in 1989.
	   Zhivkov held the record among his east European peers for time
in office _ 35 unbroken years from 1954 until his fall in the
anti-communist revolutions of 1989.
	   It was a longevity largely based on such absolute servility to
Moscow that Zhivkov once proposed that Bulgaria should merge with
the Soviet Union.
	   In this, too, he was exceptional. Even the leaders of other
Soviet satellites in eastern Europe occasionally demonstrated
varying degrees of independence, or simply were slow in switching
to the latest orientation of their Soviet masters.
	   Like others who rose to Communist heights after World War II,
Zhivkov came from a rural background, being born into a poor family
in Pravets, near Sofia, on Sept. 7, 1911.
	   He was part of a country generation that got its first education
after World War I had dissolved the Ottoman and Habsburg empires
that had ruled the Balkans for centuries, and one of many such
rural products whose learning led him to embrace revolution and
communism. Zhivkov joined the illegal Communist party in 1932.
	   His meteoric rise through the party ranks started in 1944, when
the Bulgarian Communists seized power with the backing of the Red
Army.
	   By 1948, Zhivkov was the influential party chief in the capital,
Sofia. In 1954, he became first secretary of Bulgaria's staunchly
Stalinist Communist Party.
	   Bulgaria's course meshed tightly with Moscow's until the late
1980s, when Soviet dogmatism eased under Mikhail Gorbachev _ a man
Zhivkov despised for betraying the hard-line communist cause.
	   In 1956, Zhivkov demonstrated his loyalty to Nikita Khrushchev
by siding with him in his condemnation of Josef Stalin. With the
same ease, he allied with Leonid Brezhnev and other Moscow
hardliners when they ousted Khrushchev in 1964.
	   In 1965, Zhivkov crushed an attempt by some Bulgarian Communists
to yank the country from its increasingly tight Soviet orbit,
declaring afterwards that he was ``with the Soviet Union for life
or death!''
	   Only years after Zhivkov himself was ousted did he admit that
``all Soviet leaders made mistakes.''
	   Remembering his once-regular meetings with Brezhnev, who ruled
the Kremlin from 1964-82, Zhivkov conceded the Soviet leader was
``too ill to hold serious conversations in his final years.''
	   ``It's clear he should have resigned,'' he acknowledged in an
interview with The Associated Press in March. ``He didn't
understand the real situation.''
	   The best Soviet leader among the many he worked with was
Khrushchev, he said. The worst: Mikhail Gorbachev, ``who betrayed
us and sold us'' by precipitating the collapse of an empire.
	   Zhivkov dealt mercilessly with dissent, imprisoning thousands of
people in the infamous Lovech and Skravena prison camps in the
1950s and 1960s.
	   ``He served the Soviet Union more ardently than the Soviet
leaders themselves did,'' wrote Georgi Markov, a defector working
for the BBC in London. In 1978, Markov was murdered _ most likely
by Bulgarian agents _ using a special umbrella to inject him with a
tiny poison vial.
	   For decades, the Bulgarian people feared ``Papa'' Zhivkov. For
most, who never met Zhivkov in person but knew him only from his
frequent photos and TV appearances, Zhivkov was known best for the
countless jokes created about him _ ventures that could land their
authors in jail.
	   This underground popular art form largely exploited Zhivkov's
rural simplicity and depicted him in embarrassing situations while
dealing with foreign partners.
	   In the 1970s, the government-controlled propaganda machine
created a personality cult of Zhivkov mirroring that of Brezhnev in
the Soviet Union. An attempt to groom his daughter Ludmila as heir
ended with her death under unclear circumstances in 1981.
	   In the mid-1980s, as the country's debt-ridden economy started
to collapse, Zhivkov tried to whip up nationalist support by
cracking down on the Turkish minority, making them change their
names to Bulgarian-sounding ones. About 320,000 people eventually
fled to Turkey.
	   But with the advent of Gorbachev's reforms, Zhivkov's grip on
power started to slip. Unlike Gorbachev, Zhivkov could not blame
predecessors for past mistakes.
	   Abandoned by Gorbachev, who viewed old-style Stalinists as a
major embarrassment, Zhivkov was ousted as head of the communist
party in 1989 and replaced as president of Bulgaria.
	   Zhivkov was arrested the following year on charges of
misappropriating state funds. He was tried in 1991, found guilty
and sentenced to seven years in prison. But his failing health
meant he never went to jail, spending his final years under house
arrest while still being investigated for allegedly channeling
funds to foreign Communist movements, for inciting ethnic hatred
with his anti-Turkish policy and imprisoning dissenters.
	   In 1998, Zhivkov was suddenly reinstated as a member of the
Socialist party, which succeeded the Communists, and found himself
able to alarm rivals and inspire rousing ovations again.
	   ``Because of my age, I would prefer that people choose someone
who is younger,'' he told the AP this year. ``But they can't free
themselves from thinking about me. That's the psychology of the
people.''
	   He is survived by his son, Vladimir, who lives in Sofia. Details
of funeral plans were not immediately known.

Colombian president leaves office after scandal-plagued four years

<TEXT>
	   BOGOTA, Colombia (AP) _ Nothing could unseat President Ernesto
Samper _ not close campaign aides testifying that he took millions
of dollars from drug traffickers, Washington stripping him of his
visa or even marchers in Bogota shouting ``Samper Resign!''
	   Samper will leave office Friday after completing his
scandal-plagued four-year term. By most accounts, Colombia is worse
off than it was four years ago.
	   The decades-old guerrilla war, which killed at least 125 people
this week, is as violent as ever. Human rights abuses by state
agents and right-wing paramilitary squads are up, along with
inflation, unemployment and the fiscal deficit.
	   Colombia, once admired for the heroism of its judges and
policemen who fought the likes of Medellin cartel bosses Pablo
Escobar and Carlos Lehder, is now often viewed as a place where
drug lords have infiltrated the highest levels of power.
	   ``It's going to take a whole generation to repair the damage
Samper did to our international image,'' said Rodrigo Losada, a
political scientist at Bogota's Javeriana University.
	   During his farewell address to Congress last month, the
president was unrepentant, calling himself a ``victim of one of the
most cruel and unjust opposition campaigns in history.''
	   ``I was the object of a feeling of national expiation for a
fault that we all share,'' he said.
	   Not all of Colombia's ills can be blamed on Samper. The country
was strife-torn long before he took office.
	   But the Samper years changed the way Colombians view their
highest office and introduced ``a new level of cynicism into
politics,'' said journalist Maria Jimena Dusan.
	   The drug-money scandal that crippled Samper's presidency also
spurred a discussion about ethics in public life.
	   Legal proceedings that resulted in more than two dozen
congressmen and top officials behind bars for receiving cartel
money entered a new phase last week when prosecutors announced the
investigation of another dlrs 500 million in alleged cartel payouts
to public figures.
	   Suspicion that Samper himself accepted dlrs 6 million from the
Cali cartel was first raised by the man who will replace him
Friday, former Bogota mayor Andres Pastrana.
	   A few days after losing to Samper in 1994 presidential
elections, Pastrana played for reporters taped phone conversations
of Cali drug kingpins discussing campaign contributions to Samper.
	   Pastrana, who met Monday in Washington with U.S. President Bill
Clinton, has pledged to negotiate with both the 5,000-member
National Liberation Army and the 15,000-member Revolutionary Armed
Forces of Colombia, the country's largest rebel group. The
guerrillas have been fighting since the 1960s.
	   Samper said he didn't know about the donations he now admits
entered the campaign, but two of his top campaign aides testified
publicly that he did know. And 110 congressmen who voted not to try
the president in 1996 are themselves being investigated by the
Supreme Court for criminal irregularities in that controversial
decision.
	   ``If he didn't know what was happening in his own campaign, then
we've been governed the past four years by a fool,'' Santiago
Medina, Samper's former campaign treasurer, told The Associated
Press at his lavish Bogota home. He is serving a five-year sentence
under house arrest for his role in the scandal.
	   Samper survived by cutting deals with powerful interests and
dishing out favors that critics say plundered the national
treasury.
	   He even tried to cozy up to the United States, which goaded
Samper to prove his anti-drug credentials. The result was the
greatest paradox of his presidency: The man who came to power with
money from the Cali cartel was the one who ended the era of the big
cartels by jailing their leaders.
	   The 700 metric tons of cocaine leaving Colombia each year,
however, has not decreased. Cocaine is now smuggled by smaller,
more discreet organizations.
	   ``Samper leaves a tragic legacy,'' said Enrique Parejo, a former
justice minister who survived after a Medellin cartel hitman shot
him five times in the head in 1987. ``The political class who
should have judged him instead mounted a farce to absolve him.''

Angolan refugees cross into Namibia
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   WINDHOEK, Namibia (AP) _ Fleeing attacks in southeast Angola,
110 pro-government refugees crossed into Namibia, state television
reported.
	   Nekhaya Kavango, spokesman for the group, said rebel UNITA
sympathizers attacked his group to retaliate for their welcome of
government police into the area, the television reported on
Wednesday.
	   Kavango said police are under steady barrage by UNITA troops in
the Calai area, about 800 kilometers (490 miles) northeast of
Windhoek.
	   The Angolan government claims that rebel UNITA forces have
killed hundreds of civilians and police in recent months, while the
rebels allege that police have murdered their supporters.
	   About 500,000 people died in Angola's two-decade-long civil war
before a U.N.-brokered deal in 1994 established a tenuous peace
between the two sides.
	   UNITA has refused to relinquish control of its four last
remaining rural strongholds, leading to escalation of conflict in
recent weeks.
	   The refugee group, which included about 50 children, was seeking
permission to stay near the border and keep an eye on cattle and
belongings left behind in Calai.
	   Namibian Home Affairs Minister Jerry Ekandjo however said the
refugees would be deported back to Angola if they refused transport
to an official camp hundreds of kilometers (miles) to the south.
	   Another group of refugees, 73 young men trying to escape
conscription into the Angolan army, were arrested two weeks ago and
sent back to Angola, the National Society for Human Rights said.

	   TOKYO (AP) _ A Brazilian woman has demanded 1.5 million yen
(dlrs 10,400) in a suit accusing a jewelry shop owner and his
mother of barring foreigners from their store, a court in central
Japan said Thursday.
	   Ana Bortz, 34, filed the suit with the Shizuoka District Court
branch in Hamamatsu on Wednesday, said a court official, speaking
on condition of anonymity.
	   The suit alleges racial discrimination against Bortz, a reporter
for the Hamamatsu branch of IPC Television Network Corp., a
Tokyo-based satellite company broadcasting programs in Portuguese
and Spanish.
	   ``Discrimination is a social problem, not only mine,'' Bortz
said in a telephone interview with The Associated Press. ``The
society has to be educated, and I believe the most important thing
is to discuss the problem so people have better understanding.''
	   Bortz said she hoped the lawsuit would contribute to more social
discussion of human rights.
	   She said the owner of the jewelry shop Seibido demanded that she
leave after asking about her nationality on June 16.
	   Shopowner Takahisa Suzuki pointed to a notice posted in the
store that read: ``No foreigners admitted,'' and pressed a police
notice _ cautioning shopowners against about shoplifting _ against
her face, she added.
	   Bortz immediately protested and asked the shopowner's mother,
70, to remove the notice, but she refused to do so.
	   The shopowner then called the police, but they simply told her
and the Suzukis to settle the dispute between themselves, Bortz
said. At officers' request, the mother unwillingly wrote ``We are
sorry'' in Japanese on a tiny piece of paper, she added.
	   ``I was just browsing in the shop, which had a lot of gemstones
from Brazil on display,'' she said. ``It was a very sad incident.''
	   In the suit, the Brazilian said Suzuki and his mother had
violated the civil code and the International Convention on the
Elimination of all Forms of Racial Discrimination. Japan ratified
the international convention in 1995.
	   Foreigners, especially those from non-Western countries, often
face discrimination in Japan.
	   In crime reports, local media often use such terms as ``a person
who appeared to be a foreigner'' in describing a suspect. Police
regularly announce statistics on crimes by foreign suspects,
although authorities have acknowledged that the crime rate among
foreigners in Japan is not higher than that among Japanese.
	   More than 10,000 Brazilians, many of them factory workers of
Japanese descent, live in Hamamatsu, an industrial city 150
kilometers (93 miles) west of Tokyo.

Philippine bus passenger shoots driver for driving slowly
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MANILA, Philippines (AP) _ An impatient passenger shot a bus
driver who was slowly maneuvering through rush-hour traffic on one
of metropolitan Manila's busiest streets, officials said Thursday.
	   The driver, Abraham Flores, 21, said he survived the close-range
shooting Tuesday because the assailant was in a hurry to jump out
of the bus after he fired his .45-caliber pistol. The shot grazed
Flores on the side of his neck.
	   The unidentified gunman escaped on foot, police said.
	   ``The man was very impatient and was shouting invective at me,''
Flores said in a telephone interview from a hospital. ``But I told
him I could not do anything because it was rush hour. I told him to
bear the traffic like the rest of us.''
	   ``You are too slow, it seems like you are strolling in the
park,'' Flores quoted the man as saying. ``Can't you go faster?''
	   Flores said the man was seated in the middle of the bus but then
moved to a seat near him and menacingly stared at him for a while
before speaking.
	   The man then stood up, went to the door, pulled out a pistol
from his clutch bag and fired a single shot before jumping out of
the bus and fleeing, Flores said.
	   Police said they were still trying to identify Flores'
assailant.
	   Manila's traffic is among the worst in Asia.

brands.
	   Bridgestone will establish a new entity called
Bridgestone/Firestone New Zealand Ltd. in Auckland on Sept. 1.
	   The new company, capitalized at 23 billion yen (dlrs 159.7
million), will inherit operations and employees of Bridgestone
Tyres Ltd. and Firestone N.Z. Ltd., the company said.
	   The move is aimed at streamlining and strengthening
Bridgestone's position in the New Zealand market, the company
noted.
	   Bridgestone has owned Firestone Tire and Rubber Co. of the
United States since 1988.

	   TOKYO (AP) _ Tax cuts. New spending. A massive bank bailout.
Japan's new government is plowing ahead this week with a
three-point program to patch up the ailing economy and win over the
markets.
	   Some wonder if that will be enough.
	   Prime Minister Keizo Obuchi, elected premier just last week by
Parliament, was to lay out the details of his plan in his first
policy speech before the legislature on Friday.
	   The speech was to contain the same points he made in his
campaign and since winning his post: 6 trillion yen (dlrs 41.7
billion) or more in tax cuts, 10 trillion yen (dlrs 69.4 billion)
in new spending and moves to clean up bad bank debts.
	   But with unemployment hitting a record high of 4.3 percent and
expected to go higher, some critics say pumping more money into the
system will not lead to the deep structural changes needed to build
an expanding economy.
	   ``Japan is taking the entirely wrong strategy,'' said Andrew
Shipley, chief economist at Schroders Securities (Japan). ``This
alone isn't going to kick-start growth.''
	   Instead, Shipley and other critics say Japan needs to create a
more dynamic system that allows weak companies _ particularly banks
_ to fall, leaving stronger institutions to power a recovery.
	   On that score, Obuchi's government has been less clear.
	   On Wednesday, the Cabinet approved two bills to clean up Japan's
massive bad debt problem _ one allowing the government to take over
insolvent banks, the other creating a special mediator to resolve
claims on properties used as collateral for bad loans.
	   Japanese financial institutions are suffocating under problem
loans estimated at more than 80 trillion yen (dlrs 556 billion),
mostly left over from the collapse of the real estate market in the
early 1990s.
	   The so-called ``bridge bank'' legislation, however, leaves key
details vague. While it will set up a system allowing the
government to act aggressively on the banks, it also allows enough
room for it to stop short of decisive action.
	   Even Obuchi's tax-cut plan _ which is in line with what many
economists are calling for to boost consumption _ has drawn fire
from some critics who fear it won't be accompanied by any real
changes in the tax code.
	   ``The plan only serves to delay a thorough reform of the tax
system,'' said the Nihon Keizai newspaper, Japan's top economics
daily, in an editorial on Thursday.
	   The government has been sweetening the plan this week. On
Wednesday, Finance Minister Kiichi Miyazawa said the tax cuts would
go well over the advertised 6 trillion yen (dlrs 41.7 billion).
	   He also said that Japan would shelve efforts to rein in its
ballooning budget deficit until the economy had perked up.
	   Markets, meanwhile, were still jittery about the new government.
The benchmark Nikkei Stock Average fell below 16,000 points on
Monday, and the yen fell to nearly an eight-year low earlier in the
week.

Iraq stops U.N. inspection team from carrying out duties
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with Iraqi News Agency saying no team banned, minor
editing. &QL; 
 &UR; By LEON BARKHO &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   BAGHDAD, Iraq (AP) _ Iraq stopped a team of U.N. inspectors
Thursday from carrying out searches for banned weapons in Baghdad,
an Iraqi government official said.
	   The move came a day after President Saddam Hussein froze
cooperation with U.N. inspectors to protest eight years of economic
sanctions. It was the most defiant Iraqi gesture since a crisis
over searches of presidential compounds was resolved in February,
averting a possible U.S. and British military strike.
	   The decision will likely return the issue of U.N. sanctions to
international attention and could renew a confrontation with the
United States.
	   The United States had downplayed Saddam's declaration Wednesday
of a freeze on cooperation, saying it would wait to see what
happened when inspectors tried to continue their work.
	   The U.N. team was stopped when Iraqi escorts refused to
accompany it in its search Thursday in Baghdad, the official said.
Without the Iraqi escorts, U.N. teams are not able to conduct their
work.
	   In the past, the Iraqis have withheld escorts for the U.N. teams
as a way of impeding the inspections, which are usually carried out
as surprise visits.
	   The U.N. team was not allowed to conduct ``discussions with
Iraqi authorities on arms or visits to sites or searches for past
weapons,'' the official told The Associated Press.
	   The Iraqi News Agency, however, said that no team was banned
from doing its work. It did not say whether escorts were denied.
	   The government allowed monitoring of other sites already
inspected to continue. About 460 sites in Iraq have been inspected
and are being monitored. About 100 U.N. experts visit the sites or
use remote-controlled cameras and sensors as part of a surveillance
system set up in 1994.
	   Convoys of U.N. vehicles left the Canal Hotel on the eastern
outskirts of Baghdad followed by a similar number of cars of Iraqi
officials. No one interfered with their work.
	   ``Ongoing monitoring continues,'' Janet Sullivan, a U.N.
spokeswoman, told the AP.
	   The move Thursday followed a breakdown in talks between Iraq and
the United Nations over the inspections. Chief U.N. weapons
inspector Richard Butler left Baghdad on Monday and was scheduled
to brief the U.N. Security Council later Thursday.
	   Butler said Iraqi Deputy Prime Minister Tariq Aziz ended the
talks when Butler refused to declare the Iraqis in full compliance
with the inspection program, the main condition for lifting
economic sanctions against Iraq.
	   The government statement on Wednesday said Saddam had decided to
``completely suspend cooperation'' with the U.N. Special Commission
and the International Atomic Energy Agency.
	   It said monitoring activities would be allowed on the condition
that U.N. personnel ``carry out the monitoring strictly respecting
Iraq's sovereignty, security and its people's dignity.''
	   Government-run newspapers lauded Saddam's decision.
	   ``Our people will accept nothing less than the lifting of
sanctions,'' Al-Qadissiya newspaper said Thursday.
	   The sanctions were imposed after Iraq's 1990 invasion of Kuwait
and have crippled the economy by banning the free sale of oil, the
country's economic mainstay.
	   To lift them, inspectors must certify Iraq's weapons of mass
destruction have been dismantled. Inspectors have been searching,
monitoring and accounting for Iraq's chemical and biological arms,
nuclear program and long-range missiles since 1991.

Jobless picture improves in July, federal office says
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   NUREMBERG, Germany (AP) _ The number of Germans without work
rose slightly in July but the increase was less than in previous
years, signaling an improvement in the jobs market, the federal
Labor Office said Thursday.
	   The unemployment rate rose to 10.7 percent, or 4.13 million, in
July, from 10.5 percent a month earlier.
	   The increase was due entirely to seasonal factors, Labor Office
vice president Klaus Leven said, meaning that the jobs picture
overall in Germany was showing signs of improvement.
	   Joblessness continues to be more severe in the former East
Germany, at 17.4 percent, compared with a rate of 9.1 percent in
the western part of the country.
	   Germany's high jobless rate has been the key campaign issue in
this year's federal election, set for Sept. 27.
	   Chancellor Helmut Kohl, who has been trailing his Social
Democratic challenger, Gerhard Schroeder, in the polls for months,
presented last month's declines as evidence his policies were
taking hold.
	   However, an independent economic institute on Wednesday rejected
Kohl's optimistic forecast that German unemployment will dip below
4 million this fall.

Autopsy on Taiwanese politician finds pin pricks
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with arrests in grafs 3-4, body to be returned
Saturday, RECASTS slightly &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   BEIJING (AP) _ Initial autopsy results appear to substantiate
reports that a Taiwanese politician found dead in northern China
was killed by a lethal drug overdose, official media reported
Thursday.
	   Doctors performing an autopsy on Lin Ti-chuan, a city council
deputy from southern Kaohsiung, discovered five pin pricks in her
right arm, the China Daily reported. No other external wounds were
found, but results of laboratory tests of blood and tissue samples
taken from her will not be available for several days, the official
paper said.
	   Police have arrested two alleged accomplices in Lin's kidnapping
and murder, but are still searching for three main suspects,
Taiwanese media reported.
	   Huang Shidong and Zhang Shifeng were arrested on a train in
northeastern Heilongjiang province Tuesday, the TVBS cable network
reported. It quoted police as saying they suspected the two of
guarding Lin and her boyfriend, Wei Dan-kang, who escaped from his
captors and alerted police.
	   Lin was found dead at hospital in the northeastern town of
Haicheng July 29, two days after she was reportedly kidnapped along
with Wei.
	   Her remains are to be returned to Kaohsiung Saturday, Lin's
aides told Taiwanese media. China's official Xinhua News Agency had
reported her remains would be returned Thursday.
	   Chinese police say the crime was the result of a commercial
dispute, and more than 200 detectives have been mobilized to hunt
for three men suspected in the case. The suspects include a manager
of a trading company that was reportedly owed U.S. dlrs 700,000 by
Wei.
	   The case has provoked anger in Taiwan over a perceived
callousness by Chinese officials toward the safety of Taiwanese in
China, where many have business dealings. Such incidents put a
damper on Taiwanese tourism in China, and Taiwanese politicians
have already called for a suspension of new investment in China.
	   Both Taipei and Beijing have sought to prevent the incident from
slowing gradual movement toward a renewal of their dialogue, broken
off in 1995.
	   Mindful of the Taiwanese public's sensitivity over such
incidents, China's state media have portrayed officials as anxious
to accommodate Lin's family. Facilities have been provided for
traditional Buddhist mourning ceremonies, and officials have agreed
to return her remains to Kaohsiung before sunset according to
Taiwanese custom, the official Xinhua News Agency reported.
	   The Haicheng business community has contributed 85,000 yuan
(U.S. dlrs 10,240) toward the cost of returning Lin's remains,
Xinhua said.

Four policemen killed, five wounded in land mine explosion
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   NEW DELHI, India (AP) _ Four policemen were killed and five
others wounded in central India when their vehicle hit a land mine
apparently set by Maoist guerrillas, news agencies reported.
	   The explosion Thursday was in a rural area in Gadchiroli
district, 800 kilometers (500 miles) east of Bombay, United News of
India said.
	   Maoist rebels, also called Naxalites after their place of origin
in India, say they want to create a communist state comprising
tribal areas of the states of Maharashtra, Andhra Pradesh, Madhya
Pradesh and Bihar.
	   They mostly target land owners, accusing them of exploiting
landless farm hands, but frequently attack police and
administration officials for allegedly colluding with the land
owners to deny agricultural workers their rights.
	   In the last 15 years, more than 5,500 people have died in
violence between the rebels and the police.

Sugiyama upsets Graf at Toshiba Classic
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with Seles back problem &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   CARLSBAD, California (AP) _ Japan's Ai Sugiyama overcame cramps
and a late-match deficit to stun former world No. 1 Steffi Graf
6-4, 1-6, 7-5 Wednesday in the dlrs 450,000 Toshiba Tennis Classic.
	   Sugiyama, ranked 17th in the world, called for an injury timeout
after hitting a backhand winner that set up her fourth match point
in the final game of the third set. Sugiyama, suffering from cramps
in her right hamstring and right quadriceps, was treated by a WTA
Tour trainer for nearly three minutes before closing out the
victory.
	   Calling it the ``best match'' of her career, Sugiyama rebounded
from third-set deficits of 2-0 and 5-4 with Graf serving and
needing just two points to win the second-round match.
	   ``This time I played my best tennis,'' said Sugiyama, comparing
her play with her only other meeting with Graf, earlier this year
at Indian Wells. Graf cruised to a 6-0, 6-1 victory.
	   Graf, a four-time winner here, most recently in 1994, suffered
her first loss in the event in 22 matches.
	   ``It's obviously very disappointing,'' she said. ``I played
really well last night and I was going for my shots. I didn't
really do that today from the beginning.''
	   Graf returned to the tour in February after an eight-month
absence because of various injuries. Her world ranking has dropped
to No. 44, although she was seeded sixth here.
	   Fourth-seeded Monica Seles won a wild 7-6 (7-5), 7-5
second-round match over France's Sandrine Testud in the featured
night match.
	   Seles blew a 5-1 first-set lead before finally winning in the
tiebreak. Seles then rallied after trailing 5-1 in the second set.
	   A Graf victory would have set the stage for a quarterfinal-round
matchup with Seles in a battle of former No. 1s. The pair have not
met since Graf won in the final of the 1996 U.S. Open.
	   Seles did not attend a post-match press conference because her
back was bothering her and she was receiving treatment from a tour
trainer, WTA spokeswoman Veronique Marchal said.
	   ``My back has just been overused and is fatigued,'' Marchal
quoted Seles as saying.
	   ``It started two weeks ago from watching the Fed Cup matches and
then flying to California,'' said Seles, who played for the United
States in the Federation Cup in Madrid July 25 and 26. ``It just
stiffened and hasn't been the same since.''
	   Seles left the court during a changeover in the third set,
trailing 5-2, to change her dress. ``When it gets wet like that, it
gets heavy and was bothering my back even more,'' she said.
	   In other second-round matches, top-seeded Martina Hingis scored
a 6-3, 6-2 win over Natasha Zvereva of Belarus; unseeded Mary
Pierce of France upset No. 5 Conchita Martinez of Spain 6-7 (1-7),
6-2, 6-3, and South Africa's Joannette Kruger beat former French
Open champion Iva Majoli 6-3, 7-6 (7-1).
	   The momentum of the Graf-Sugiyama match changed repeatedly.
Sugiyama won the first set when she scored the only service break
in the ninth game.
	   It appeared Graf had regained control when she took a
competitive second set and won the first two games of the third.
But Sugiyama surprisingly reeled off four consecutive games,
breaking Graf's serve twice as she allowed her German counterpart
just one point in the two games.
	   Graf took a 5-4 lead on her third break of the set and was
serving for the match. Just two points away from victory, however,
Graf failed to close out the win as Sugiyama broke her serve again
to tie the match.
	   Sugiyama went ahead 6-5 before Graf staved off three match
points in the final game. Graf had two chances to tie the match and
send it into a tiebreak, but failed each time.
	   Following Sugiyama's injury timeout, Graf hit a forehand into
the net to end the match.
	   ``She played some amazing shots when it was important,'' Graf
said. ``She really went after everything.''
	   The Hingis-Zvereva score did not reflect the tight nature of the
match.
	   ``Any time I played her,'' Hingis said, ``she gives me a hard
time. ``She's a very smart player, very clever.''
	   Hingis hadn't played in a tournament since losing in the
semifinals of Wimbledon July 2. But the Swiss teen-ager responded
each time Zvereva challenged.
	   Hingis, whose only action since Wimbledon came in a Fed Cup
match in late July, said she was glad to face Zvereva in her first
match of the tournament.
	   ``I'm quite happy that I played Zvereva because she gives you a
lot of time to prepare yourself. She's not one of the big hitters
... You just get the feel of the court.''

Opposition leader says all Khmer Rouge should be pardoned
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By PATRICK McDOWELL &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) _ Cambodian opposition leader Sam Rainsy
has urged that all surviving leaders of the genocidal Khmer Rouge
be pardoned following last week's parliamentary elections.
	   Sam Rainsy finished a distant third in elections he says were
marred by violence and fraud in every constituency but one _ the
former Khmer Rouge stronghold of Pailin, which he won.
	   In a panel discussion Wednesday night at the Foreign
Correspondents Club of Thailand, Sam Rainsy endorsed giving pardons
on a national level to all Khmer Rouge leaders.
	   But at the international level, Sam Rainsy urged the United
Nations to quickly establish a permanent court to prosecute crimes
against humanity and bring Khmer Rouge leaders to justice. As many
as 2 million Cambodians died of overwork, torture, illness or
execution when the Khmer Rouge ruled the nation in the 1970s.
	   Sam Rainsy justified the contradiction by saying that since the
government had pardoned some Khmer Rouge already, all should get
the same treatment.
	   ``I would like to press the U.N. to quickly set up the
international court,'' said Sam Rainsy. The prospect, however,
seems remote.
	   Sam Rainsy, who billed himself as a ``true democrat,'' refused
to attribute his victory in Pailin _ one of 13 seats his party won
out of 122 in the National Assembly _ to his call for a Khmer Rouge
amnesty.
	   Instead, Sam Rainsy said the former Maoist-inspired guerrillas
at Pailin, who ended years of civil war in 1996 and now run a boom
town, were tough ex-soldiers hungry for democracy.
	   ``I think that the power of ideas is stronger than the power of
weapons and war,'' Sam Rainsy said.
	   Pailin's Khmer Rouge chieftain, Ieng Sary, received a pardon in
1996 in exchange for leading his men out of civil war. Amnesty has
also been granted to other top guerrillas to make peace.
	   Three high-ranking holdouts are still roaming the Thai border
with a few hundred guerrillas and remain wanted.
	   They are Ta Mok, the one-legged general known as ``The
Butcher,'' who overthrew longtime leader Pol Pot in a bloody power
struggle last year; Nuon Chea, Pol Pot's former No. 2p; and Khieu
Samphan, the group's top diplomat.
	   Khieu Samphan retains a grudging respect among some Cambodians
for his career as an anti-corruption politician in the 1960s, a
role Sam Rainsy, a former finance minister, has carved out for
himself.
	   ``Nobody can convince me that Khieu Samphan is worse than Ieng
Sary,'' Sam Rainsy said.
	   Sam Rainsy and the other chief opposition party, the royalist
FUNCINPEC, have rejected the election results as being manipulated
by Hun Sen. FUNCINPEC's leader, Prince Norodom Ranariddh, was
ousted as co-prime minister by Hun Sen last year in a bloody coup.
	   Sam Rainsy and a FUNCINPEC official said they expected King
Norodom Sihanouk would soon pardon the top army commander who
stayed loyal to the prince, Gen. Nhek Bunchhay, of allegations by
Hun Sen that he was helping the prince plot a coup of his own.
	   Nhek Bunchhay's small band of loyalists was supported for months
along the rugged border with Thailand with unacknowledged support
from the Khmer Rouge die-hards under Ta Mok, who shared a common
enemy in Hun Sen.

Kurdish guerrillas kidnap mayor in southeast Turkey
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   ANKARA, Turkey (AP) _ Kurdish rebels kidnapped a mayor and three
other people Thursday at a roadblock in southeastern Turkey, the
Anatolia news agency said.
	   The guerrillas, fighting for autonomy in Turkey's southeast,
often target civilians, especially when under pressure from the
Turkish military.
	   The rebels stopped eight vehicles near the town of Bahcesaray of
southeastern Van province and abducted the town's mayor, Naci
Orhon, along with three other people, the semi-official agency
said.
	   On Wednesday, the military claimed killing 165 rebels in three
southeastern provinces in a major offensive over the past week.
	   The war between Kurdish guerrillas and government forces has
claimed 37,000 lives since 1984.

	   KATMANDU, Nepal (AP) _ Floods and landslides triggered by heavy
monsoon rains have killed 113 people in Nepal since June, the
government said Thursday.
	   Rescue and relief workers were distributing food, clothes,
plastic sheets, tents and medicine in the lowlands at the foot of
the Himalayas. Almost 8,000 families have lost their homes or
crops.
	   The Home Ministry has warned the continuing rains are likely to
cause more havoc for at least two weeks.

French carmaker Renault posts healthy sales
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   PARIS (AP) _ French carmaker Renault said Thursday its 1998
sales for the first half of the year reached 122 billion francs
(dlrs 20 billion), an increase of 22 percent over the same period
last year.
	   The company attributed the healthy earnings to the success of
the Megane, the Clio II and the passenger car and light commercial
version of the Kango.
	   Renault said the company's sales volume rose 17 percent to just
over a million cars and commercial light vehicles, giving it a 30
percent market share in France.

Help arrives from abroad as fires rage unchecked
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   ATHENS, Greece (AP) _ Firefighting aircraft and personnel
arrived from Italy and France on Thursday to help battle forest
fires that raged around Greece, including a wall of flames that
threatened to engulf the ancient site of the Olympic games.
	   A brush fire was within about a kilometer (1/2 mile) of the more
than 2,000-year-old monuments of Ancient Olympia, about 185
kilometers (110 miles) southwest of Athens, police said.
	   On Mount Pendeli near Athens, at least one person was found dead
in an area where firefighers struggled against winds of up to 61
kilometers an hour (38 mph) fanning remnants of a major brush fire
that began Sunday, the fire department said.
	   Greek officials requested international help to battle the worst
season of brush and forest fires in decades. In July alone, more
than 3,000 wildfires were reported compared with 2,800 for the
entire summer season last year, the government said. Officials
suspect arson in some of the blazes.
	   France sent three firefighting planes and fire crews. Italy also
dispatched two firefighting planes. A French aircraft to coordinate
efforts also arrived.
	   A massive fire on Mount Pendeli northeast of Athens flared up
again Thursday after being brought under control Wednesday night. A
military hospital was evacuated, while the wind-whipped flames
reportedly damaged homes and the local police station.
	   Police shut down the main road in Pendeli to allow access for
fire trucks, while radios broadcast appeals for motorists to avoid
clogging the area. Electricity pylons were also affected, causing
frequent power outages throughout the capital.
	   Another fire on Mount Taygetos in southern Greece was reportedly
brought under partial control after burning since July 27.

 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with higher death toll announced &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   BEIJING (AP) _ More than 2,000 people have died in China's long
season of summer flooding, the government announced Thursday.
	   More than 90 percent of those killed between June and Aug. 3
were crushed in landslides and mud flows that buried houses and
farms in several parts of the country, according to information
released by the Ministry of Civil Affairs at a news conference.
	   The newly announced toll was 700 higher than previous official
figures.
	   Floods caused by rains that fell earlier and heavier than usual
have lifted the Yangtze River to its highest level since 1954, when
catastrophic flooding killed 30,000 people. This year's death toll
is the highest since summer floods in 1991.
	   Waterlogged dikes have burst at several points along the
Yangtze, inundating swathes of farmland and forcing hundreds of
thousands to find shelter inland from the river or on the tops of
embankments.

Rocket hits airport after night of fighting

	   KABUL, Afghanistan (AP) _ A rocket hit the perimeter of Kabul's
airport Thursday after a night of heavy firing north of the Afghan
capital that Taliban troops said wounded two civilians.
	   No casualties were reported in the airport rocket attack and a
state-owned airlines plane landed and two Taliban fighter jets took
off soon afterward, indicating no serious damage was done.
	   The anti-Taliban alliance has vowed to continue firing on the
airport from just north of Kabul as long as Taliban military jets
use it. U.N. aid flights also use the airport, but none was
scheduled Thursday.
	   The front line just north of Kabul was calm Thursday morning,
but a heavy exchange of firing was heard overnight. Taliban
fighters said two civilians were injured by shrapnel, but reported
no military casualties and said no ground had been gained or lost.
	   Reports from the other side of the front line were not
immediately available.
	   The Taliban control most of Afghanistan including Kabul, which
they took in 1996. The factions opposing the Islamic militia have
been pushed into a corner of northern Afghanistan, where they
control just one major city, Mazar-e-Sharif.
	   Taliban fighters are poised to attack Mazar-e-Sharif, about 300
kilometers (180 miles) north of Kabul, but have not said when they
would strike.
	   Their hesitancy comes after a brutal defeat last May, when the
Taliban retreated from Mazar-e-Sharif after street battles in which
hundreds of Taliban soldiers died. As many as 2,000 Taliban
prisoners of war reportedly were later massacred.
	   The Taliban have imposed a strict version of Islamic law in
areas they control. Most women are barred from work and most girls
from school, music is banned, men are required to wear beards and
public mutilation of thieves is common.

	   TOKYO (AP) _ Bridgestone Corp., a major Japanese tire maker,
said Thursday that it will merge the two New Zealand units that
have separately handled marketing of Bridgestone and Firestone
brands.
	   Bridgestone will establish a new entity called
Bridgestone/Firestone New Zealand Ltd. in Auckland on Sept. 1.
	   The new company, which is capitalized at 23 billion yen (dlrs
159.7 million), will inherit operations and employees of
Bridgestone Tyres Ltd. and Firestone N.Z. Ltd., the company said.
	   The move is aimed at streamlining and strengthening
Bridgestone's position in the New Zealand market, the company
noted.
	   The major Japanese tire maker has owned Firestone Tire and
Rubber Co. of the United States since 1988.

	   MANILA, Philippines (AP) _ The Securities and Exchange
Commission said Thursday the committee overseeing a rehabilitation
plan for Philippine Airlines is scheduled to meet next Monday to
discuss progress in keeping the cash-strapped airline in business.
	   The committee will also discuss the replacement of the airline's
president, Jose Antonio Garcia, who resigned last month, it said.
	   PAL's operations have been devastated by labor problems in
recent months. The airline is also buckling under a mountain of
debt and its earnings have been badly hit by the regional financial
crisis.
	   SEC Associate Commissioner Fe Eloisa Gloria is to preside over
the hearing. Gloria was recently appointed by President Joseph
Estrada as acting head of the commission while SEC chairman
Perfecto Yasay is serving a 90-day suspension imposed last month by
the government's ombudsman in a property dispute involving the SEC.
	   The hearing is necessary to fill the president's slot vacated by
Garcia, who reportedly will join food and beverage conglomerate San
Miguel Corp.
	   Garcia's departure, however, may have set back the drafting of
PAL's rehabilitation plan.
	   His resignation reduced to four from five the number of members
of a committee charged with drawing up the survival plan.
	   Among other things, the committee is to deal with the airline's
creditors and take control of all assets.
	   PAL has already secured temporary payment relief on debts
totaling dlrs 2.1 billion.
	   The SEC has given PAL until Sept. 21 to submit a viable
rehabilitation plan.

	   TOKYO (AP) _ Japan's sales of imported automobiles fell for the
16th straight month in July, plunging 19.8 percent from a year
earlier, an industry group said Thursday.
	   Sales of imported cars, buses, and trucks fell to 25,146 in
July, the Japan Automobile Importers Association said.
	   Sales of imports have been tumbling in Japan as the country
struggles through its worst recession in decades. A drop in the yen
against the dollar has also hurt sales by making imports more
expensive.
	   Sales of imported passenger cars fell 17.7 percent to 24,209
while sales of trucks sank 51.7 percent to 933, the group said.
Import dealers sold just four foreign-made buses in July.
	   German automakers accounted for 54.3 percent of import-sales in
Japan, although overall their sales slipped 6.6 percent for the
month to 13,152 vehicles. BMW of Germany was one of the only
foreign automakers to enjoy an increase, selling 3,147 cars, or
37.4 percent more than in the same month a year earlier.
	   Among U.S. automakers, General Motors sold 1,757 cars in Japan
last month, 31.2 percent less than a year before.
	   Sales of cars built in the United States, including those from
the U.S. factories of Honda and Toyota, fell 40.1 percent to 5,097.
	   Just 27 U.S.-made Hondas were sold in Japan last month _ 98.7
percent less than the 2,077 cars it sent to Japan from factories in
the United States last year _ as the company replaced imports with
cars made in Japan.

	   BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) _ More than a thousand Thais will lose
their jobs when one of Southeast Asia's largest rubber firms shuts
down its curing plants next week, company officials said Thursday.
	   Teck Bee Hang Company will shut down 12 rubber curing plants in
Thailand's southern provinces on August 15. Company officials said
employees will receive severance pay.
	   Unemployment in Thailand is expected to reach 2.2 million this
year as the effects of the country's worst economic crisis in
modern times hits home.
	   Thailand is the world's largest rubber producer, followed by
Indonesia and Malaysia.
	   Company officials declined allegations that they were rushing to
shut the plants before a new labor law takes effect Aug. 19. The
law guarantees workers a minimum of four months severance pay.
	   ``It is the best time for us to curtail operations of
unsuccessful sites and put our money into increasing production at
our 11 bar rubber plants,'' said a company executive, who spoke
only on condition of anonymity.
	   Demand for cured rubber products in Japan, the company's chief
export market, has been falling, she said, adding that as supplies
of raw rubber were less than manufacturers' demand, the company
would use its raw materials to produce bar rubber for the American
and European markets where demand for those products is rising.
	   ``Keeping the unproductive curing plants means big losses,'' she
said.

	   SUVA, Fiji (AP) _ A government-owned tuna cannery may soon be
taken over by U.S. company Bumble Bee Seafoods, Fiji's Agriculture
and Fisheries Minister Militoni Leweniqila said Thursday.
	   Leweniqila said the Pacific Fiji Company Ltd., operator of a
cannery at Levuka, on Ovalau island, 60 miles (100 kms) from Suva,
will enter into a five year tuna loining contract with Bumble Bee.
	   The new contract will succeed an expiring 12-month trial during
which the U.S. company supplied the cannery with fish.
	   Under the five year deal, Bumble Bee can purchase the cannery
within the first 12 months of the new contract.
	   The Levuka cannery has a canning capacity of more than 15,000
(metric) tons and has preferential access to European Union markets
under the Lome trade and aid agreement that the union has with 70
African, Caribbean and Pacific Island states.
	   Bumble Bee Seafoods Inc., based in San Diego, is one of the
world's largest distributors of canned tuna and salmon and the
second largest tuna producer in the United States.
	   Its share of the total canned tuna market is 23 percent,
compared with 45 percent for Star-Kist Foods and 14 percent for
Chicken of the Sea. In premium white meat tuna, Bumble Bee has a 39
percent market share.
	   Bumble Bee has processing plants in Santa Fe Springs near Los
Angeles; Mayaguez, Puerto Rico; and Manta, Ecuador. The company
employs about 3,000 people.

	   On Wednesday, two days after the end of the period covered by
the latest death toll, a levee that protected 35,000 people in
Jiujiang city, along the Yangtze in south China, gave way. Weaving
between submerged trees and power lines, rescuers in speedboats
rushed to pluck people from the water, the official newspaper
Beijing Youth Daily said.
	   Fears that the levee might collapse prompted officials to move
20,000 people out of area before it ruptured, and another 14,000
people were moved from their homes after the breach, said a
Jiujiang Flood Prevention official, who gave his surname, Xu.
	   As of Thursday, there were no reports of deaths or injuries, he
said.
	   But the bodies of 13 people were recovered in Jiayu, a county
upstream where a levee collapsed Saturday, the official Hubei Daily
reported. Nineteen soldiers who were swept away when the dike burst
were missing, the official China Daily added.
	   Police turned foreign reporters away from Paizhou, one of two
towns in Jiayu hit by the flood. Military trucks bearing Red Cross
flags bore down on the area carrying bags of supplies.
	   After weeks of rain, dikes along the Yangtze are saturated and
threaten to give way at any time in thousands of places. Millions
of residents and soldiers patrol around the clock, on the lookout
for cracks or signs of weakness. Neck deep in water, they plug
holes and shore up the levees with sandbags, stones and wooden
stakes in anticipation of several more weeks of battle with the
river.
	   Another flood crest, the fourth this year, was rushing down the
Yangtze from Chongqing in Sichuan province, promising more high
waters in the days ahead.
	   But Tropical Storm Otto, which officials had feared could
further strain waterlogged dikes, weakened after it hit China's
southeast coast Wednesday and was no longer powerful enough to be
classed as a storm, the State Meteorological Bureau said Thursday.
Fujian, the province where Otto landed after killing one person on
Taiwan, reported no casualties or losses.
	   In Jiayu, the dike burst and waters poured into fields with
terrifying speed, according to survivors interviewed by AP
Television.
	   A grandmother and lifelong resident, Lin Fengying, estimated
hundreds were swept away. A Hong Kong-based human rights group
claimed Tuesday that more than 1,000 people were believed to be
missing.
	   Jiayu officials said the majority of the 57,000 people who were
flooded out had been resettled, and the government was providing
food and water.
	   A farmer who only gave his surname, Cong, blamed ineffectual
local officials for neglecting the dike and for responding slowly
when disaster struck.
	   ``This was all because of slack vigilance on the part of
officials,'' said Cong.
	   A few days before collapsing, the Jiayu embankment had sprung a
leak that was never plugged effectively, the Yangcheng Evening News
reported.

Dollar higher in Tokyo, Japanese stocks decline
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with late afternoon dollar and bond rates &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ Tokyo stocks sank for the fourth straight day
Thursday, led by declines in bank shares as the yen fell against
the dollar.
	   The 225-issue Nikkei Stock Average lost 115.94 points, or 0.72
percent, closing at 15,876.22. On Wednesday, the Nikkei index had
slipped 31.42 points, or 0.20 percent.
	   Traders said the falling yen prompted some foreign investors to
sell Japanese shares. A weaker yen makes investing in Japan less
attractive for overseas investors because it erodes their profits
in terms of their home currencies.
	   The dollar bought 144.67 yen in late afternoon trading, up 0.86
yen from late Wednesday in Tokyo and above its late New York rate
of 143.86 yen overnight.
	   Bank shares suffered heavy losses amid worries that opposition
parties may block a bill designed to clean up bad loans. Bank of
Tokyo-Mitsubishi shares tumbled 61 yen, or 4.6 percent, to 1,279
yen while Sumitomo Bank fell 46 yen, or 3.6 percent, to 1,233 yen.
	   ``There are worries that the (cleanup) plans will be delayed,''
said Naoki Takahashi, manager at Marusan Securities.
	   Prime Minister Keizo Obuchi's government sent two key bank bills
to Parliament Wednesday. Opposition politicians say the legislation
stops short of the decisive action needed to restore health to the
financial system.
	   The broader Tokyo Stock Price Index of all issues listed on the
first section was down 8.69 points, or 0.70 percent, to 1,227.09.
It had fallen 1.17 points, or 0.09 percent, the previous day.
	   Trading on the exchange's main section was estimated at 382
million shares, up slightly from 363.67 million Wednesday.
	   Declines outnumbered advances 689 to 432, while 165 issues were
unchanged.
	   In currency trading, the U.S. dollar was higher against the yen
following an overnight rebound on Wall Street. In Tokyo trading
Thursday, it ranged between 143.61 yen and 145.05 yen.
	   Market players bought up dollars against the yen to cover short
positions after the U.S. currency's recent slide halted overnight.
	   The dollar had fallen against the yen over the last few days
after Japan outlined more details of a proposed 6 trillion yen
(dlrs 41 billion) tax cut.
	   ``We've been hearing about the tax cuts for a while, and that
helped the yen, but it had to end sometime,'' said Kazuteru
Hasegawa, head of foreign exchange trading at Bank of America in
Tokyo.
	   The dollar also got a boost after the Dow Jones industrial
average gained 59.47 points Wednesday, rebounding from its
299-point loss Tuesday.
	   The yield on the benchmark No. 182 10-year Japanese government
bond fell to 1.215 percent from Wednesday's finish of 1.225
percent, driving its price up to 111.68 yen from 111.61 yen.

Increase in wolves worries authorities in northern Ukraine
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   KIEV, Ukraine (AP) _ The wolf population in northern Ukraine is
on the rise and they are attacking livestock, while authorities who
previously paid hunters to kill the wolves are out of money, a
newspaper reported Thursday.
	   The wolves recently killed 10 cows in a Chernihiv region village
and three calves from a collective farm in another village,
according to the newspaper Fakty. One wolf attacked and bit a
hunter after he wounded the beast.
	   Regional authorities are currently trying to attract hunters to
help kill the wolves, whose numbers have risen to about 300 in
recent years, said Volodymyr Vovnyanko, top hunting official in
Chernihiv's forestry department.
	   The hunters received 100 hryvna (dlrs 50) for each wolf they
killed in 1997, but today the authorities have no money to pay
them, he said.

129 Rebels, 33 soldiers killed in two weeks of operation: military
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   COLOMBO, Sri Lanka (AP) _ Sri Lankan forces have gained ground
from Tamil rebels in the battle for a vital road in northern Sri
Lanka, but fighting in the last two weeks claimed more than 160
lives on both sides, the military said Thursday.
	   Military spokesman Brigadier Sunil Tennekoon said 129 rebels and
33 soldiers were killed, and 66 more soldiers were wounded in
fighting since July 22, summarizing events in a weekly briefing.
	   ``We are inflicting huge blows on the terrorists and we are
gaining ground,'' he said without elaborating. Most of the
casualties were in the Mankulam area where government troops have
been trying to dislodge rebels from the strategic road junction.
	   Mankulam, 250 kilometers (155 miles) north of the capital,
Colombo, is the largest town along the 77-kilometer (48-mile) road
the army has been trying to capture since May 1997, in the longest
and bloodiest offensive of its 15-year-old civil war.
	   So far, troops have captured about two thirds of the highway,
with another 27 kilometers (17 miles) to go.
	   The road would link the Jaffna peninsula, a former rebel
stronghold captured by the army three years ago, with the rest of
the country. Since the army takeover, Jaffna's half million people
have had to rely on air and sea deliveries for food and other
supplies.
	   Tennekoon said government troops also attacked rebels positions
in the Jaffna and Kilinochchi areas and destroyed their sea bases.
``All our operations were successful,'' he said.
	   Militants among Sri Lanka's 3.3 million Tamils are fighting for
an independent homeland for the minority Tamils in the north and
east of the island country off India's southern coast.
	   They say Tamils are discriminated against in Sri Lanka where the
ethnic Sinhalese are in majority. The government denies the charge.

<TEXT>
	   PARIS (AP) - Paul Flamand, the co-founder of one of the biggest
French publishing houses, Editions du Seuil, has died, the
publishing house said Thursday. He was 89.
	   Flamand died Tuesday in Saint-Cheron, a Paris suburb, Editions
du Seuil said.
	   Born in 1909 in Aigre, in southwestern France, Flamand and Jean
Bardet founded the Editions du Seuil in 1935, which they left in
1979.
	   Editions du Seuil, which is now headed by Claude Chekri, has a
catalog of more than 9,000 titles, including literature, children's
books, history and art.
	   The funeral was to be held Friday.

University officials appeal for calm amid riots
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   KHARTOUM, Sudan (AP) _ A Khartoum University official appealed
Thursday to students to stay calm while authorities investigate the
death of a law student that prompted protests.
	   Zubeir Bashir Taha, the university's vice chancellor, said in a
a statement to students that an autopsy on Mohammed Abdel-Salam
showed he died of a brain hemorrhage. But he said the circumstances
leading to his death were still under investigation.
	   Taha called on ``all students and all the university's family to
arm themselves with patience and tolerance,'' he said.
	   The opposition National Democratic Alliance, based in
neighboring Eritrea, said Abdel-Salam died Tuesday in custody.
	   The plea for calm comes a day after police fired tear gas and
used batons to disperse hundreds of students protesting an increase
in university fees. The protests began Saturday.
	   Khartoum University, Sudan's leading institute of higher
education, has frequently been the launching pad for political and
social upheavals in Sudan, Africa's largest country.

	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Striking ambulance workers in the eastern port
city of Vladivostok have turned down 186 calls for help since their
protest began earlier this week, news reports said Thursday.
	   There are usually 30 ambulance teams on duty, but only four are
currently on the job. They are responding only to life-threatening
situations, calls involving children under age 2, and pregnant
women going into labor, the ITAR-Tass and Interfax news agencies
reported.
	   Other patients are either referred to outpatient clinics or
consulted over the telephone, the reports said.
	   The ambulance workers are demanding four months worth of unpaid
wages.
	   Meanwhile, the Vladivostok prosecutor's office has opened a
criminal investigation into the failure to the local government to
finance the ambulance service, and has urged striking workers to
return to the job while the investigation continues, Interfax
reported. But the strikers continue to remain off the job.
	   Meanwhile, on the eastern island of Sakhalin, striking miners
allowed a limited coal delivery to reach a key power plant, after a
nearly two-week blockade.
	   The miners, who are demanding eight months worth of unpaid
wages, negotiated a truce Tuesday, agreeing to allow enough coal
through to keep the plant running. But some protesters refused to
leave the tracks for another day.
	   Late Wednesday night, the first delivery of some 1,500 tons of
coal loaded on 25 rail cars was allowed to go through, the
ITAR-Tass reported.
	   Local authorities have accused the miners of causing serious
economic damage to the remote island because they have interrupted
preparations for winter, ITAR-Tass said.
	   Sakhalin, with a population of 650,000, is dependent on the
plant because it is not hooked up to Russia's national power grid.
Authorities have been rationing electricity, amid fears that the
plant would soon run out of fuel if coal deliveries did not arrive.
	   On the eastern Kamchatka peninsula, about 100 municipal workers
blocked a key highway used for transporting salmon caught off
Kamchatka's west coast, Interfax said. More than 30 trucks loaded
with fish have been stalled on the road by Thursday evening, it
said.
	   Protests over back wages have swept over Russia in recent
months. But the protests have rarely been coordinated, and workers'
pay is still arriving months late.
	   Millions of Russian workers receive their salaries months late
due to a chronic cycle of non-payments that has plagued the country
for years.

Death toll tops 2,000 in China's summer floods
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BEIJING (AP) _ More than 2,000 people have died in China's long
season of summer flooding, the government announced Thursday.
	   More than 90 percent of those killed between June and Aug. 3
were crushed in landslides and mud flows that buried houses and
farms in several parts of the country, according to information
released by the Ministry of Civil Affairs at a news conference.
	   The newly announced toll was 700 higher than previous official
figures.
	   Floods caused by rains that fell earlier and heavier than usual
have lifted the Yangtze River to its highest level since 1954, when
catastrophic flooding killed 30,000 people. This year's death toll
is the highest since summer floods in 1991.
	   Waterlogged dikes have burst at several points along the
Yangtze, inundating swathes of farmland and forcing hundreds of
thousands to find shelter inland from the river or on the tops of
embankments.
	   Civil Affairs Ministry officials said they were considering
breaching a major levee along the river to divert water out of the
main channel and into farmland to protect major cities.
	   Collapsing levees along the Yangtze, the world's third-longest
river, have been the worst nightmare for disaster workers who have
struggled for weeks to hold back floodwaters.
	   Central Hubei province, the area worst hit by the flooding,
declared a state of emergency Thursday, the official Xinhua News
Agency reported. It said that with water levels expected to rise
further, provincial authorities had issued a ``do or die'' order to
local residents to help safeguard major cities and levees.
	   Flooding has also caused serious damage in northeastern China,
in central Shaanxi province, and in southern Guangdong and Guangxi.
	   On Wednesday, two days after the end of the period covered by
the latest death toll, a levee that protected 35,000 people in
Jiujiang city, along the Yangtze in south China, gave way. Weaving
between submerged trees and power lines, rescuers in speedboats
rushed to pluck people from the water, the official newspaper
Beijing Youth Daily said.
	   Fears that the levee might collapse prompted officials to move
20,000 people out of the area before it ruptured, and another
14,000 people were moved from their homes after the breach, said a
Jiujiang Flood Prevention official, who gave his surname, Xu.
	   As of Thursday, there were no reports of deaths or injuries, he
said.
	   But the bodies of 13 people were recovered in Jiayu, a county
upstream where a levee collapsed Saturday, the official Hubei Daily
reported. Nineteen soldiers who were swept away when the dike burst
were missing, the official China Daily added.
	   Police turned foreign reporters away from Paizhou, one of two
towns in Jiayu hit by the flood. Military trucks bearing Red Cross
flags bore down on the area carrying bags of supplies.
	   After weeks of rain, dikes along the Yangtze are saturated and
threaten to give way at any time in thousands of places. Millions
of residents and soldiers patrol around the clock, on the lookout
for cracks or signs of weakness. Neck deep in water, they plug
holes and shore up the levees with sandbags, stones and wooden
stakes in anticipation of several more weeks of battle with the
river.
	   Another flood crest, the fourth this year, was rushing down the
Yangtze from Chongqing in Sichuan province, promising more high
waters in the days ahead.

	   SEOUL, South Korea (AP) _ Torrential rains triggered floods and
landslides in Seoul and surrounding provinces Thursday, killing at
least 58 people, leaving 30 missing and submerging thousands of
homes.
	   Disaster relief headquarters urged 200,000 people in low-lying
districts in and near the capital to evacuate as tributaries of the
Han River, which bisects the city, threatened to overflow.
	   Suburbs north and west of Seoul were submerged in waist-deep
water. Rescuers used rubber boats to help move citizens to higher
ground. Uijongbu, a satellite city north of Seoul, was completely
cut off, with roads swept away, a subway line flooded and telephone
poles downed.
	   In a riverside resort town north of Seoul, relief workers
recovered seven bodies from mudslides that covered bungalows and
shops. They were searching for 17 more believed missing and feared
dead.
	   Four people were killed when a restaurant in an amusement park
in northern Seoul collapsed under a mudslide. The Defense Ministry
said at least nine soldiers were killed by a landslide while
working to restore damaged communications lines.
	   Four people were killed when a flash flood slammed into their
homes in a valley near Uijongbu. A 49-year-old woman was
electrocuted in a nearby city.
	   Firefighter Chan Mu-won, 28, was swept away after he waded into
swirling floodwaters and helped two people to safety. His body was
found six hours later.
	   Thursday's deaths brought to 184 the number of dead or missing
from heavy rains that have lashed South Korea since last weekend.
Flash floods raced down streams and ravines in a national park in
the southern part of the nation over the weekend, leaving 65 people
dead and 31 missing.
	   ``Most of today's victims either drowned or were buried in
landslides. The figures will rise when floods subside and we look
more closely at the debris,'' said Chang Yong-min, a relief worker.
	   U.S. soldiers near the border with communist North Korea were
trying to recover several shipping containers of small arms
ammunition swept away by rains, said Jim Coles, spokesman of the
U.S. military command.
	   An unknown number of land mines were uprooted and swept away
along a portion of the demilitarized zone separating South and
North Korea. The region was declared off limits. As many as a
million mines are believed strewn along the DMZ as a military
deterrent.
	   Up to 61 centimeters (24 inches) of rain poured down in Seoul
and its suburbs between late Wednesday and Thursday morning,
submerging 5,800 homes and other buildings and leaving at least
3,000 people homeless.
	   With weather forecasters predicting more rain, long lines of
people trekked along railway lines to higher ground. Large
stretches of green rice fields disappeared under brown floodwater.
	   In Seoul, subway service was disrupted during busy commuting
hours when water submerged tracks.
	   President Kim Dae-jung ordered the military to send soldiers and
equipment to step up relief efforts.
	   The downpours mostly affected Seoul and regions near the North
Korean border, 60 kilometers (37 miles) north of the capital.
Weather officials could not immediately tell how much rain fell in
North Korea, where famine is spreading after years of floods,
droughts and other bad weather.
	   On Wednesday night, a Korean Air passenger plane skidded off a
rain-slicked runway while landing at Seoul's Kimpo International
Airport, injuring 22 people.
	   The flight, carrying 397 passengers from Tokyo's Narita airport,
bounced and skidded before coming to a halt in a meadow. One of the
airport's two runways remained closed Thursday, forcing delays in
landings.

Civilian wounded in Israeli shelling, rockets land near border
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   NABATIYEH, Lebanon (AP) _ Guerrillas fired rockets near the
Lebanese-Israeli border Thursday, and Israeli forces shelled
southern Lebanon. A 110-year-old Lebanese man was wounded.
	   Israeli forces shelled suspected guerrilla hideouts after
Hezbollah fighters attacked an Israeli-occupied border enclave with
rockets and mortars Wednesday night, security officials said.
	   Abdel Hassan Boushar was cut slightly in the face by broken
glass after an Israeli shell crashed near his house in Kfar Tibnit,
a village just outside the occupied zone, said the officials,
speaking on customary condition of anonymity.
	   Earlier Thursday, guerrillas of the Iranian-backed Hezbollah
group fired about 12 Katyusha rockets and mortar shells at three
Israeli-held outposts near Lebanon's border with Israel, a
Hezbollah official said. No casualties were reported.
	   Hezbollah is leading a guerrilla war to try to oust some 1,500
Israeli soldiers and the 2,500 members of the Israeli-allied South
Lebanon Army militia from the occupied zone.
	   Israel set up the zone in 1985 to protect its northern towns
from guerrilla attacks across the border.

Hong Kong stocks close at lowest level in 3 1/2 years
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   HONG KONG (AP) _ Hong Kong shares plunged to their lowest level
in 3 1/2 years Thursday, weighed down by higher interest rates and
dismal earnings reports from blue-chip companies.
	   The Hang Seng index, the market's key indicator of blue chips,
lost 212.07 points, or 2.8 percent, and closed at 7,254.36, its
lowest level since January 1995. This year's previous low was
7,462.50 on June 15.
	   Confirmation Wednesday by the Hong Kong Monetary Authority, the
territory's quasi-central bank, that it bought Hong Kong dollars
dragged the overnight interbank interest rate down, but long-term
rates remained high.
	   ``The higher interest rates were ... affecting market
sentiment,'' said Eugene Law of Lippo Securities.
	   Analysts said a speculative move against the Hong Kong dollar is
possible, adding that dismal earnings by Hong Kong's big companies
also discouraged investors.
	   A disappointing earnings report from conglomerate Swire Pacific
added to a string of bad news that had driven the key index down
almost 6 percent in the first three days of the week.
	   Swire Pacific, which owns 44 percent of Hong Kong's flagship air
carrier Cathay Pacific, reported a 39 percent decline in profits
for the first half of the year.
	   Shares of Swire Pacific A lost 1.25 Hong Kong dollars, closing
at 24.20, while those of Cathay Pacific dropped 0.25 to 5.65. On
Wednesday, the airline announced its first ever loss, 175 million
Hong Kong dollars (U.S. dlrs 22.43 million).
	   The day's biggest losers were HSBC Holdings, down 3.50 to
168.00; Hutchison Whampoa, down 2.10 to 33.40, and Hang Seng Bank,
down 1.60 to 38.50.
	   The day's only gainers were Great Eagle Holdings, up 0.25 to
6.30; China Telecom, up 0.15 to 10.00, and Hong Kong and China Gas,
up 0.10 to 7.90.

Hall-of-Fame broadcaster Jack Brickhouse dies at age 82
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   CHICAGO (AP) _ Hall of Fame broadcaster Jack Brickhouse, for
four decades the voice of the Chicago Cubs, died early Thursday at
age 82.
	   Brickhouse was pronounced dead at St. Joseph Health Centers and
Hospital near his home on the North Side. The Cook County Medical
Examiner's office said it suspected Brickhouse suffered a heart
attack.
	   Brickhouse underwent brain surgery March 3 for a 2-centimeter
tumor doctors discovered after his leg gave way while he was
getting dressed to attend the Feb. 28 funeral of Harry Caray, who
replaced Brickhouse in the Cubs' television booth in 1982.
	   Doctors said the surgery was successful and Brickhouse was
discharged in April after undergoing therapy at the Rehabilitation
Institute of Chicago.
	   Brickhouse spent nearly four decades broadcasting the Cubs,
first on WGN radio and later TV. He also broadcast the Chicago
Bears for 24 years and worked games of the Chicago White Sox and
Chicago Bulls.
	   His home run call was famous:
	   ``Back, back, back. That's it! Hey-hey! Hey-hey!''
	   He was honored at Wrigley Field in 1979 for his 5,000th
broadcast. He retired in 1981 and was inducted into the Hall of
Fame in 1983.
	   He began his radio career at age 18 in 1934 in his hometown of
Peoria, grossing dlrs 17 a week. He came to Chicago in 1940 and
later was working 80-hour weeks.
	   Brickhouse also put his voice to barn dances, man-on-the-street
shows, political conventions and conducted one-on-one interviews
with six presidents. He covered both of the national conventions in
1944 for the Mutual Broadcasting System and worked conventions in
1960, 1964 and 1968 for WGN-TV.
	   A stretch of Michigan Avenue near the Chicago Tribune's building
is named ``Jack Brickhouse Way.''
	   ``Saturdays and Sundays, which were supposed to be the rest of
the world's leisure days, were my big days because my job was to
give listeners or viewers some relaxation from the tough week they
might have had,'' Brickhouse said.

 &UR; Imprisoned British trader Nick Leeson has cancer
 &UR; Eds: RECASTS and UPDATES throughout with statement from British
lawyer saying cancer has spread from colon to lymph system; comment
from ex-wife &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ Imprisoned securities trader Nick Leeson, whose
futures dealing brought down Britain's oldest merchant bank, is
suffering from colon cancer which has spread to his lymph nodes,
his lawyers said Thursday.
	   Leeson, 31, has been taken to Changi Prison hospital in
Singapore, where he is serving a 6 1/2 year sentence for two
cheating charges stemming from the 1995 crash of Barings bank.
	   A statement from his London-based law firm Kingsley Napley said:
``On Aug. 5 in Singapore Nick Leeson was diagnosed as suffering
from cancer of the colon which has spread to his lymph nodes. As
can be imagined, Mr. Leeson's family and that of his ex-wife Lisa
are devastated at the news.''
	   Leeson's solicitor Stephen Pollard said in a later statement
that his client was still waiting for a prognosis on the
seriousness of his condition.
	   ``It is anticipated that he may know more about the prognosis
next week, and when we have more news this will be released,'' he
said.
	   The Singapore Prisons Department said in a statement faxed to
The Associated Press: ``We confirm that he has been diagnosed with
cancer of the colon and that he is receiving treatment.''
	   Prison officials refused to answer other questions, including
whether Leeson would be allowed to transfer to another hospital, be
seen by a physician of his choice, or be released early if he were
dying. Pollard refused to say whether he might ask for Leeson's
transfer.
	   Lisa Leeson, 30, who has not seen her ex-husband in more than a
year and is due to remarry later this month, expressed ``deep
shock'' at the news of his illness.
	   Leeson, the son of a plasterer, was raised on a public housing
project at Watford, near London, speaks with a regional accent, and
never went to university. His father, William, who lives in
Watford, said he learned of his son's illness Wednesday from the
lawyers.
	   Asked if he thought conditions in the Singapore jail had
contributed to his son's condition, the elder Leeson replied: ``No.
The jail ... is as good as gold.''
	   Leeson lost dlrs 1.38 billion speculating on Asian stock markets
from his base in Singapore. British investigators concluded that
financial controls within Barings were ``woefully inadequate'' and
faulted the Bank of England for not keeping close enough tabs on
Barings.
	   Barings went broke in February 1995 after Leeson wrongly bet
that Tokyo stock prices would rise. The bank was taken over by the
Dutch banking and insurance company, ING Group.
	   Leeson began serving his sentence in December 1995.
	   The British High Commission in Singapore says he is being
visited regularly by consular officials.
	   	   A movie, ``Rogue Trader,'' based on a book Leeson wrote in
Germany while fighting extradition to Singapore, is due for release
next year. It stars Ewan McGregor and Anna Friel.

Albanians assail latest violence in Kosovo
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with latest on fighting, Holbrooke saying U.S. has
given Milosevic `very forceful' message, Russian envoy's comments,
UNHCR sending convoy to Malisevo; trims &QL; 
 &UR; By ISMET HADJARI &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   PRISTINA, Yugoslavia (AP) _ Citing the latest wave of Serb
violence, the leader of Kosovo's Albanians and officials in
neighboring Albania issued fresh calls for outside intervention in
the battered province.
	   ``It's time to use all measures for stopping the repression
against thousands of innocent people who are staying in the
mountains, hungry and defenseless,'' Albania's Foreign Ministry
said late Wednesday.
	   The pleas come at a time international sentiments on a possible
military operation to try to halt the conflict remain split,
despite its having entered what U.S. special envoy Richard
Holbrooke called an ``extraordinarily dangerous new phase.''
	   However, Holbrooke told CNN late Wednesday that the possibility
of intervention is increasing ``dramatically'' as the Serbs press
ahead with an offensive despite promising last month to halt
military operations against the majority ethnic Albanian population
in Kosovo.
	   He said another American envoy, Christopher Hill, had handed
Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic a message ``of a very
forceful nature'' during a six-hour meeting in Belgrade, urging him
to halt the actions.
	   Nonetheless, Serb sources said there was continued fighting
Thursday on the road between Pristina and Prizren near the village
of Crnoljevo, as well as sporadic clashes near Junik, close to the
Albanian border. The ethnic Albanians also claimed Serb forces
shelled Likovac, where Hill last week met with Kosovo Liberation
Army fighters, and other villages in the Drenica region.
	   Russian Deputy Foreign Minister Nikolay Afanasyevsky, in
Belgrade for talks with Serb officials Thursday, described the
situation in Kosovo as ``very fragile'' and told reporters that ``I
still hope the escalation of fighting will stop and that
negotiations will start.''
	   Recent Serb attacks have emptied whole villages and killed
civilians as well as KLA fighters. Ethnic Albanian sources claimed
Thursday that 40,000 refugees have fled the latest offensive.
	   ``Serb forces attack and kill unprotected people, systematically
destroy and burn property of Albanians, which led to the
displacement of tens of thousands of Albanians,'' ethnic Albanian
leader Ibrahim Rugova said, reiterating his call for help.
	   Bujar Bukoshi, prime minister of the ethnic Albanians'
government-in-exile, appealed on Albanian TV Wednesday night for
Kosovo Albanians to organize their defenses better. He urged world
leaders and humanitarian organizations to ``take all emergency
measures to halt the genocide in Europe.''
	   On Thursday, the U.N. refugee agency said it was sending a
convoy to Malisevo because fighting around that town had died down.
Refugees camped outside the town were to receive 10 tons of flour,
2,000 food parcels, 1,200 baby food packs and other aid.
	   Agency spokeswoman Maki Shinohara expressed concern in Geneva
that Serb authorities were encouraging the displaced to return home
even as houses around Malisevo were continuing to be set alight.
	   While aid agencies are continuing efforts to provide help to the
refugees, international efforts to reach a consensus in favor of
military intervention have remained stalled.
	   Despite NATO's longstanding threat to step in, officials at NATO
headquarters in Brussels said this week that no military action is
planned at this stage for Kosovo. And on Wednesday, Washington
appeared to ease its position on intervention, based on comments
reported by a visiting German politician.
	   ``We agreed that an intervention _ if that were to happen at all
_ can and should only happen under the umbrella of the United
Nations Security Council with a United Nations mandate,'' German
opposition candidate Gerhard Schroeder said after meeting with
President Bill Clinton.
	   The statement was not entirely consistent with U.S. policy,
which holds that no new Security Council resolution is needed for
force to be used in Kosovo. U.S. officials did not immediately
comment on the discrepancy.

Doctors say Havel improving
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   PRAGUE, Czech Republic (AP) _ President Vaclav Havel's condition
improved Thursday as his heart rate stabilized and X-rays confirmed
his pneumonia slowly receding.
	   Havel's personal physician Ilja Kotik, said in a statement that
his temperature dropped toward normal overnight, presumably due to
the positive effect of treatment with antibiotics.
	   After a life-threatening episode this week in which Havel's
pneumonia was complicated by an irregular heartbeat, doctors put
the president on a new type of antibiotics Wednesday.
	   According to Kotik, the number of arrhythmias, or heartbeat
irregularities, also decreased as Havel's fever went down.
	   ``X-ray pictures indicate the size of lung inflammation is
shrinking,'' he said.
	   The Czech leader suffered a ruptured colon in April while
vacationing in the Austrian Alps. He underwent emergency surgery
and a colostomy was performed.
	   On July 26, a combined Austrian-Czech team of doctors in Prague
closed the colostomy. Havel developed pneumonia related to the
operation on Monday.
	   Havel's condition worsened the following day as his heart rate
soared to 200 beats per minute and doctors had to stabilize his
condition with electric shocks.
	   Havel, a former chain smoker and veteran of communist jails, has
suffered from chronic bronchitis for years.
	   He has been hospitalized five times since December 1996 when a
third of his lung and a cancerous tumor were removed.

Dow effect short-lived, Asian markets resume downward spiral
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with Hong Kong index closing at 3 1/2-year low, 5th
graf &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   HONG KONG (AP) _ Wall Street's overnight recovery provided a
brief respite for Asia Thursday, but financial markets only paused
before continuing their downward spiral.
	   The Dow Jones average fell almost 300 points on Tuesday, and was
in negative numbers most of Wednesday before rebounding at the
close for a gain of 60 points.
	   Most Asian markets opened quietly Thursday, and many initially
followed the Dow, posting small gains. The good feelings wore off
quickly because of local worries and the renewed weakness of the
Japanese yen against the dollar.
	   In Hong Kong, the earnings report for conglomerate Swire Pacific
added to the string of bad news on corporate earnings and the gross
domestic product that drove the market down almost 6 percent in the
first three days of the week. Swire Pacific reported a 39 percent
decline in profits for the first half of the year.
	   The key Hang Seng index shed another 212 points, or 2.8 percent,
Thursday to close at 7,254.36, its lowest level since January 1995.
	   Hong Kong markets also were spooked by fears of an attack by
currency speculators on the Hong Kong dollar, which forced up
interbank interest rates.
	   In Tokyo, the Nikkei index was flat in early trading, but fell
more sharply as the day went on, closing down almost 116 points, or
0.72 percent, at 15,876.22.
	   Traders in Tokyo had noted a tentative reversal of recent
sentiments. Instead of pessimism about Japan's ability to dig
itself out of its troubles, there was hope that Prime Minister
Keizo Obuchi would announce large tax cuts to encourage growth. And
the prevailing optimism about the U.S. economy was replaced by a
wait-and-see attitude.
	   However, the dollar climbed against the yen again Thursday, and
that helped drive share prices down. A stronger dollar increases
the yen value of the banks' loan assets overseas and affects their
capital adequacy ratios.
	   Across much of Asia, early gains were short-lived.
	   Taiwan shares closed lower for the 10th day in a row because of
fears that the local economy may be slowing.
	   The Manila market, which had hit a five-year low in previous
days, rebounded Wednesday. On Thursday, investors cashed in on some
of those gains, driving the market down to a new low. The
Philippine Stock Exchange Index fell 43.86 points, or 2.9 percent,
to 1,480.89.
	   South Korea's benchmark Korea Composite Stock Price Index closed
down 2.26 points at 320.57 on a series of negative factors
including fears about the U.S. economy, the yen, and the
possibility that the Chinese currency will be devalued.

Italy sends Pakistanis home
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   ROME (AP) _ Italy sent 143 Pakistanis home Thursday in the first
mass repatriation since thousands of would-be immigrants began
reaching Italy's shores this summer.
	   Italy and Tunisia were reported near an agreement to help stem
the flow and facilitate repatriation of immigrants. Many who have
landed in Italy came from the North African country.
	   The Italian-Tunisian talks, which began Monday, were extended by
a day after the two sides failed on Wednesday to reach an
agreement.
	   Italy has signed similar agreements with about a dozen nations,
including Morocco last month.
	   Ever since Germany and other European allies complained that too
many illegals were reaching them via Italy's largely unpatrolled
coasts, Rome has cracked down. Instead of just handing illegal
immigrants expulsion papers giving them 15 days to leave,
authorities now confine them to shelters while they await
repatriation by ship or plane.
	   The Pakistanis were put on a special Alitalia flight to
Islamabad.
	   Italy is keen on signing an accord with Tunisia because it needs
consent from authorities there before it can send the immigrants
back.
	   Most of the centers in Sicily and other southern cities have
become overcrowded and fights frequently break out among
immigrants, or with police.
	   As part of the negotiations, Italy also asked Tunisia to
strengthen controls along its coastline to help stem the flow of
immigrants who are arriving daily. Most make the journey on
overcrowded vessels and land on the tiny island of Lampedusa, which
is closer to Africa than Sicily, or on shores along Italy's south.
	   More than 3,000 immigrants, mostly from Tunisia, Morocco and
other poor African nations, reached Italy in July alone. The flow
of immigrants traveling to Italy usually picks up considerably in
the summer months when the weather is warmer and seas calmer.

England wins toss and bats first in the fifth test
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   LEEDS, England (AP) _ England named an unchanged side and South
Africa opted for an all-seam attack Thursday as England captain
Alec Stewart won the toss and decided to bat first in the fifth
cricket test at Headingley.
	   South Africa, still smarting from an unexpected defeat in the
fourth test at Trent Bridge, made two changes _ replacing medium
paceman Steve Elworthy with all rounder Brian McMillan and left-arm
spinner Paul Adams with fast bowler Makhaya Ntini.
	   Both teams face a must win situation in a series deadlocked at
1-1.
	   A win for England will give the homeside its first five-test
series win in 12 years, while South Africa is aiming to secure its
first series win in England since its return to test cricket in
1992.
	   McMillan, a 37-test veteran, is making his first appearance for
South Africa since playing in the third test against Australia at
Adelaide in February this year. He has missed South Africa's last
nine tests.
	   The inclusion of McMillan will bolster South Africa's at-times
vulnerable middle-order in addition to his role as part of the
four-pronged attack spearheaded by Allan Donald, Shaun Pollock and
Ntini.
	   England: Michael Atherton, Mark Butcher, Nasser Hussain, Alec
Stewart (captain), Mark Ramprakash, Graeme Hick, Andrew Flintoff,
Dominic Cork, Ian Salisbury, Darren Gough, Angus Fraser.
	   Twelfth man: Allan Mullally.
	   South Africa: Gary Kirsten, Gehardus Liebenberg, Jacques Kallis,
Daryll Cullinan, Hansie Cronje (captain), Jonty Rhodes, Mark
Boucher, Shaun Pollock, Brian McMillan, Allan Donald, Makhaya
Ntini.
	   Twelfth man: Pat Symcox.
	   Umpires: Peter Willey (England) and Javed Akhtar (Pakistan).

Romanians call for rain with prayers and ancient customs
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BUCHAREST, Romania (AP) _ After three weeks of searing heat,
Romanians are calling on the gods to bring rain to their parched
land.
	   Teoctist, the head of the Orthodox Church, declared in comments
reported by Romanian papers Thursday: ``May God forgive our sins
and water our fields and help us to overcome these hard times we
live in.''
	   Mainly elderly people flocked to church, kneeling in prayer in
front of icons on church steps for cooler climes. Temperatures have
been 40 Celsius (104 Fahrenheit) or higher for the past three days.
	   In villages around Bucharest, there were reports of ancient
customs being performed. One, which dates back thousands of years,
involves a pregnant woman dancing in fields, her body draped with
leaves, calling on the rain gods.
	   In a custom called ``Caloianul,'' girls tearfully bury a male
clay doll and call for the blessing of the rain gods, the daily
Libertatea reported.
	   It has not rained for about three weeks, said meteorologist
Diana Damian, adding that a little rain was possible later
Thursday.
	   Romanians are a mystic people. About 90 percent of Romanians are
Orthodox believers and most others belong to the Catholic and
Reformist churches.
	   In the three-week heat wave, over one million hectares (2.5
million acres) of sunflower, wheat and corn were burned by the
heat, the agriculture ministry reported.
	   More than 25 deaths have been attributed by officials to the
high temperatures.

Turkish armed forces select new top brass
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   ANKARA, Turkey (AP) _ The military Thursday appointed a new
lineup of top commanders, who are expected to pursue the military's
battle against radical Islam.
	   The chief of staff, Gen. Ismail Hakki Karadayi, who led the
military's successful campaign to pressure an Islamic-led
government to resign last year, has reached retirement age. He will
be replaced by Gen. Huseyin Kivrikoglu.
	   Kivrikoglu had been heading the army for the past year.
	   The military has been acting as the self-appointed guarantor of
Turkey's secular system. It has declared the battle against radical
Islam a top priority.
	   Gen. Atilla Ates replaced Kivrikoglu as the army commander and
Gen. Rasim Betir was promoted to chief of the Jandarma, Turkey's
paramilitary police.
	   Karadayi's deputy, Gen. Cevik Bir, was appointed to the command
of the 1st Army based in Istanbul, a promotion that could open the
way for him to become army chief. Bir has been a prominent public
figure as the military's spokesman against pro-Islamic politics.
	   Karadayi was awarded the military's top medal for his
``outstanding success in preserving the unity and welfare of the
Turkish Republic.''
	   The military also reportedly purged 23 officers for their ties
to radical Islamic groups, adding to the 100 purged for the same
reason in June.
	   Turkish law empowers the military, which has staged three coups
since the 1960s, to defend the country's secular principles as well
as fight domestic and foreign threats.

Cambodian leader Hun Sen warns of political crisis
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with Hun Sen's comments and details thruout &QL; 
 &UR; By KER MUNTHIT &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   PHNOM PENH, Cambodia (AP) _ Cambodian leader Hun Sen warned
Thursday of a new political crisis if opposition parties protesting
alleged election fraud followed through on threats to block the
formation of a new government.
	   ``If the two parties boycott, this will cause a crisis ...
because the old National Assembly will be dissolved,'' Hun Sen said
in an interview with Radio Australia's Khmer-language service. ``If
that really happens, the situation will look very bad. There will
be a constitutional crisis.''
	   Hun Sen made his comments one day after official results were
announced for the July 26 parliamentary election. He warned that
his Cambodian People's Party might try to govern alone if no
opposition parties joined him in a coalition government.
	   He said he might try to convene a session of the outgoing
National Assembly to amend the constitution so that just 50 percent
plus one member of parliament would be needed to be confirm a new
government, rather than the two-thirds majority now necessary.
	   Pending recounts of some votes, his Cambodian People's Party
appeared to have won a slight majority in the 122-seat National
Assembly, but nowhere near the two-thirds majority needed to form a
government or pass new laws.
	   Opposition parties, meanwhile, stepped up their attacks on the
legitimacy of the electoral process, denouncing the formula the
National Election Committee will use to allocate parliamentary
seats.
	   Prince Norodom Ranariddh, leader of the opposition FUNCINPEC
party, and his ally Sam Rainsy issued a statement Thursday
describing as ``illegal'' a little-noticed change sometime before
the election in the allocation formula.
	   The change favors the party winning the most votes in any
particular province. In practice, it worked to the advantage of the
ruling party, because under the original formula it would have won
59 seats, less than a majority.
	   Under the new formula, the CPP is slated to take 64
parliamentary seats, FUNCINPEC 43 and the Sam Rainsy Party 15.
Seats are awarded on a province-by-province basis.
	   The election committee has insisted the formula change was legal
and aboveboard, but so far has been unable to provide the reasons
for doing it or explain why the National Assembly was left out of
the process.
	   The Cambodian People's Party said Thursday that its victory at
the polls was a victory for the nation and for pluralistic
democracy, and called on the opposition to join in the new
government.
	   ``This victory is not a victory exclusively for the CPP but is
also of the entire nation which is on its path of liberal
democracy,'' the party said, promising to work hard to build up the
economy and social development.
	   A coalition with other parties that won seats in the elections
is the ``best way to guarantee national stability and to build
trust among the Cambodian people toward the government,'' it said
in a statement broadcast on a television station it controls.
	   However, Hun Sen said in his interview, which was rebroadcast on
Cambodian radio, that it might be better not to have the Sam Rainsy
Party in government, so it could provide a strong parliamentary
opposition.
	   The election came one year after Hun Sen ousted Ranariddh as his
co-prime minister in a violent coup, shattering a tense dual
premiership formed after U.N.-sponsored polls in 1993.
	   Hun Sen hoped that new election would restore his legitimacy in
the eyes of the international community and foreign aid lost after
his takeover.

Chernobyl's one working reactor is restarted
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   KIEV, Ukraine (AP) _ The only working reactor at the Chernobyl
nuclear power plant has been restarted after four days of repairs,
officials said Thursday.
	   Reactor No. 3 shut down automatically last Sunday because of an
electric transformer malfunction, and was restarted on Wednesday
afternoon, the state nuclear energy company Energoatom said.
	   The Chernobyl plant originally had four working nuclear
reactors. Reactor No. 4 was destroyed in a 1986 explosion, the
world's worst nuclear accident. Another reactor was shut down after
being badly damaged by a 1991 fire, and a third is not operational.
	   Ten out of 14 nuclear reactors at Ukraine's five nuclear power
plants were operating on Thursday, Energoatom said. The other four
reactors were undergoing planned repairs.
	   Ukraine relies on nuclear plants to produce about a half of its
electricity, and says it does not have enough money to convert to
other forms of energy.

Albanians assail latest violence in Kosovo
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with latest on fighting, Holbrooke saying U.S. has
given Milosevic `very forceful' message, Russian envoy's comments,
UNHCR sending convoy to Malisevo; trims &QL; 
 &UR; By ISMET HAJDARI &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   PRISTINA, Yugoslavia (AP) _ Citing the latest wave of Serb
violence, the leader of Kosovo's Albanians and officials in
neighboring Albania issued fresh calls for outside intervention in
the battered province.
	   ``It's time to use all measures for stopping the repression
against thousands of innocent people who are staying in the
mountains, hungry and defenseless,'' Albania's Foreign Ministry
said late Wednesday.
	   The pleas come at a time international sentiments on a possible
military operation to try to halt the conflict remain split,
despite its having entered what U.S. special envoy Richard
Holbrooke called an ``extraordinarily dangerous new phase.''
	   However, Holbrooke told CNN late Wednesday that the possibility
of intervention is increasing ``dramatically'' as the Serbs press
ahead with an offensive despite promising last month to halt
military operations against the majority ethnic Albanian population
in Kosovo.
	   He said another American envoy, Christopher Hill, had handed
Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic a message ``of a very
forceful nature'' during a six-hour meeting in Belgrade, urging him
to halt the military campaign.
	   Nonetheless, Serb sources said there was continued fighting
Thursday on the road between Pristina and Prizren near the village
of Crnoljevo, as well as sporadic clashes near Junik, close to the
Albanian border. The ethnic Albanians also claimed Serb forces
shelled Likovac, where Hill last week met with Kosovo Liberation
Army fighters, and other villages in the Drenica region.
	   Russian Deputy Foreign Minister Nikolay Afanasyevsky, in
Belgrade for talks with Serb officials Thursday, described the
situation in Kosovo as ``very fragile'' and told reporters that ``I
still hope the escalation of fighting will stop and that
negotiations will start.''
	   Recent Serb attacks have emptied whole villages and killed
civilians as well as KLA fighters. Ethnic Albanian sources claimed
Thursday that 40,000 refugees have fled the latest offensive.
	   ``Serb forces attack and kill unprotected people, systematically
destroy and burn property of Albanians, which led to the
displacement of tens of thousands of Albanians,'' ethnic Albanian
leader Ibrahim Rugova said, reiterating his call for help.
	   Bujar Bukoshi, prime minister of the ethnic Albanians'
government-in-exile, appealed on Albanian TV Wednesday night for
Kosovo Albanians to organize their defenses better. He urged world
leaders and humanitarian organizations to ``take all emergency
measures to halt the genocide in Europe.''
	   On Thursday, the U.N. refugee agency said it was sending a
convoy to Malisevo because fighting around that town had died down.
Refugees camped outside the town were to receive 10 tons of flour,
2,000 food parcels, 1,200 baby food packs and other aid.
	   In Geneva, agency spokeswoman Maki Shinohara expressed concern
that Serb authorities were encouraging the displaced to return home
even as houses around Malisevo were continuing to be set alight.
	   While aid agencies are continuing efforts to provide help to the
refugees, international efforts to reach a consensus in favor of
military intervention have remained stalled.
	   Despite NATO's longstanding threat to step in, officials at NATO
headquarters in Brussels said this week that no military action is
planned at this stage for Kosovo. And on Wednesday, Washington
appeared to ease its position on intervention, based on comments
reported by a visiting German politician.
	   ``We agreed that an intervention _ if that were to happen at all
_ can and should only happen under the umbrella of the United
Nations Security Council with a United Nations mandate,'' German
opposition candidate Gerhard Schroeder said after meeting with
President Bill Clinton.
	   The statement was not entirely consistent with U.S. policy,
which holds that no new Security Council resolution is needed for
force to be used in Kosovo. U.S. officials did not immediately
comment on the discrepancy.

Iran to close diplomatic missions abroad
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   TEHRAN, Iran (AP) _ Iran plans to close down some of its
diplomatic missions abroad as part of an austerity plan aimed at
reducing government spending, the Tehran Times reported Thursday.
	   ``The plan for reducing the number of Iranian missions abroad
and curtailing their staff will be given top priority,'' the
English-language paper quoted Foreign Ministry spokesman Mohammad
Mohammadi as saying.
	   Mohammadi said missions would be closed in countries ``which do
not have friendly relations with Iran and those which do not have
significant economic cooperation with our country.''
	   But he did not name the countries or say when the plan would go
into effect.
	   Iran, like other Gulf oil producers, has been grappling with
rising budget deficits because of low prices for oil, a main source
of government revenues.
	   On Sunday, Iranian President Mohammad Khatami called for
encouraging foreign investment and cutting the country's reliance
on oil revenues as part of his economic plan.

<TEXT>
	   SOFIA, Bulgaria (AP) _ Todor Zhivkov, Bulgaria's former
long-time Communist dictator and the last surviving Soviet-bloc
Stalinist leader, died in a Sofia hospital, officials said
Thursday. He was 86.
	   Zhivkov died Wednesday night in Losenets Hospital, where he had
fallen into a coma after being hospitalized July 8 with a
respiratory virus infection that led to severe brain
arterosklerosis, hospital director Todor Gerassimov was quoted as
saying. He also had suffered from diabetes for the past year.
	   Bulgarian President Petar Stoyanov, a reformer, expressed his
condolences to Zhivkov's family but said in a public statement that
Zhivkov oversaw ``one of the darkest periods of recent Bulgarian
history.''
	   ``Eight million Bulgarians lived during that long period with
their work, dreams and illusions, but also in fear and political
repression,'' Stoyanov said. ``With the death of Todor Zhivkov the
era of Bulgarian communism is finally ending.''
	   Zhivkov outlived both his former Kremlin bosses and other Balkan
Communist dictators.
	   Yugoslavia's Josip Broz Tito died in 1980, and Albania's Enver
Hoxha in 1985. Romania's Nicolae Ceausescu was executed in 1989.
	   Zhivkov also held the record among his east European peers for
time in office _ 35 unbroken years from 1954 until his fall in the
anti-communist revolutions of 1989.
	   It was a longevity largely based on such absolute servility to
Moscow that Zhivkov once proposed that Bulgaria should merge with
the Soviet Union.
	   In this, too, he was exceptional. Even the leaders of other
Soviet satellites in eastern Europe occasionally demonstrated
varying degrees of independence, or simply were slow in switching
to the latest orientation of their Soviet masters.
	   Like others who rose to Communist heights after World War II,
Zhivkov came from a rural background, being born into a poor family
in Pravets, near Sofia, on Sept. 7, 1911.
	   He was part of a country generation that got its first education
after World War I had dissolved the Ottoman and Habsburg empires
that had ruled the Balkans for centuries, and one of many such
rural products whose learning led him to embrace revolution and
communism. Zhivkov joined the illegal Communist party in 1932.
	   His meteoric rise through the party ranks started in 1944, when
the Bulgarian Communists seized power with the backing of the Red
Army.
	   By 1948, Zhivkov was the influential party chief in the capital,
Sofia. In 1954, he became first secretary of Bulgaria's staunchly
Stalinist Communist Party.
	   Bulgaria's course meshed tightly with Moscow's until the late
1980s, when Soviet dogmatism eased under Mikhail Gorbachev _ a man
Zhivkov despised until his death for betraying the hard-line
communist cause.
	   In 1956, Zhivkov demonstrated his loyalty to Nikita Khrushchev
by siding with him in his condemnation of Josef Stalin. With the
same ease, he allied with Leonid Brezhnev and other Moscow
hardliners when they ousted Khrushchev in 1964.
	   In 1965, Zhivkov crushed an attempt by some Bulgarian Communists
to yank the country from its increasingly tight Soviet orbit,
declaring afterwards that he was ``with the Soviet Union for life
or death!''
	   Only years after Zhivkov himself was ousted did he admit that
``all Soviet leaders made mistakes.''
	   Remembering his once-regular meetings with Brezhnev, who ruled
the Kremlin from 1964-82, Zhivkov conceded the Soviet leader was
``too ill to hold serious conversations in his final years.''
	   ``It's clear he should have resigned,'' he acknowledged in an
interview with The Associated Press in March. ``He didn't
understand the real situation.''
	   The best Soviet leader among the many he worked with was
Khrushchev, he said. The worst: Mikhail Gorbachev, ``who betrayed
us and sold us'' by precipitating the collapse of an empire.
	   Zhivkov dealt mercilessly with dissent, imprisoning thousands of
people in the infamous Lovech and Skravena prison camps in the
1950s and 1960s.
	   ``He served the Soviet Union more ardently than the Soviet
leaders themselves did,'' wrote Georgi Markov, a defector working
for the BBC in London. In 1978, Markov was murdered _ most likely
by Bulgarian agents _ using a special umbrella to inject him with a
tiny poison vial.
	   For decades, the Bulgarian people feared ``Papa'' Zhivkov. For
most, who never met Zhivkov in person but knew him only from his
frequent photos and TV appearances, Zhivkov was known best for the
countless jokes created about him _ ventures that could land their
authors in jail.
	   This underground popular art form largely exploited Zhivkov's
rural simplicity and depicted him in embarrassing situations while
dealing with foreign partners.
	   In the 1970s, the government-controlled propaganda machine
created a personality cult of Zhivkov mirroring that of Brezhnev in
the Soviet Union. An attempt to groom his daughter Ludmila as heir
ended with her death under unclear circumstances in 1981.
	   In the mid-1980s, as the country's debt-ridden economy started
to collapse, Zhivkov tried to whip up nationalist support by
cracking down on the Turkish minority, making them change their
names to Bulgarian-sounding ones. About 320,000 people eventually
fled to Turkey.
	   But with the advent of Gorbachev's reforms, Zhivkov's grip on
power started to slip. Unlike Gorbachev, Zhivkov could not blame
predecessors for past mistakes.
	   Abandoned by Gorbachev, who viewed old-style Stalinists as a
major embarrassment, Zhivkov was ousted as head of the communist
party in 1989 and replaced as president of Bulgaria.
	   Zhivkov was arrested the following year on charges of
misappropriating state funds. He was tried in 1991, found guilty
and sentenced to seven years in prison. But his failing health
meant he never went to jail, spending his final years under house
arrest while still being investigated for allegedly channeling
funds to foreign Communist movements, for inciting ethnic hatred
with his anti-Turkish policy and imprisoning dissenters.
	   In 1998, Zhivkov was suddenly reinstated as a member of the
Socialist party, which succeeded the Communists, and found himself
able to alarm rivals and inspire rousing ovations again.
	   He is survived by his son, Vladimir, who lives in Sofia. State
radio said the funeral will be Sunday afternoon in the Bulgarian
capital.

Negotiations on fissile material production ban near
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   GENEVA (AP) _ Talks on a treaty banning the production of
material used to make nuclear weapons moved a step closer Thursday
although Israel said it may need more time to consider the idea.
	   The chairman of the 61-nation Conference on Disarmament, Mykola
Maimeskoul of Ukraine, called a meeting Friday to discuss the
proposal that a committee be set up to discuss a treaty on
so-called ``fissile materials,'' plutonium and highly enriched
uranium.
	   He said a consensus on setting up the committee is ``quite
close.''
	   But Israeli Ambassador Yosef Lamdan told the forum there was
``no guarantee that this delegation will receive its instructions''
by Friday, although he expected them rather ``sooner than later.''
	   Under international pressure following their test explosions
earlier this year, Pakistan and India have both said they are ready
to engage in negotiations. Israel is considered an undeclared
nuclear power.
	   Talks are likely to progress slowly, with countries at the
conference divided on whether they should aim to ban future
production of nuclear-weapons material or also address existing
stockpiles.
	   Pakistan said last week it wants negotiations to deal with
India's stocks.
	   Action on fissile material is referred to by arms negotiators as
the ``cut off'' treaty because it would stop the production of
nuclear weapons.
	   The Geneva conference is the world's main multilateral
disarmament body. Past successes include treaties to ban chemical
weapons and to halt test explosions of nuclear bombs.

	   MANILA, Philippines (AP) _ President Joseph Estrada and Defense
Secretary Orlando Mercado were not informed before the start of
live-fire war exercises with the U.S. Navy in the South China Sea,
Estrada said Thursday.
	   Estrada said Philippine navy and air force officials will be
asked to explain why they did not inform the country's leaders of
the 18-hour exercises held Wednesday outside Philippine territorial
waters.
	   ``They simply forgot to tell us,'' Estrada told reporters. He
said the exercises were scheduled during the administration of his
predecessor, Fidel Ramos, whose term ended June 30.
	   An aide said Estrada apparently learned of the exercises several
hours after they began, when reporters sought his comment.
	   Foreign Secretary Domingo Siazon confirmed Thursday that the
exercises were held near Scarborough Shoal, a disputed area claimed
by China and the Philippines.
	   He reasserted the Philippines' claim to the shoal, and said he
would lodge a protest if China conducted similar exercises there.
	   In the event of a Chinese exercise at the shoal, ``alarm bells
will be ringing from here to Tokyo to Seoul to Washington. You can
be sure of that,'' he said.
	   Siazon said more small-scale U.S.-Philippine exercises will be
held in coming months.
	   Asked to comment on Wednesday's exercise, Chinese Embassy
spokesman Hao Yinbiao said China hopes ``it could be conducive to
peace and stability in the region'' and that relations with the
Philippines will be based on mutual trust.
	   The exercise was held as the United States was seeking approval
of an accord governing joint exercises in the Philippines.
	   Philippine navy spokesman Cmdr. Salvador Cuba said the exercises
were held outside the Philippines because of delays in the
Philippine Senate's approval of the Visiting Forces Agreement,
which would provide American troops with legal protections while on
duty in the Philippines.
	   The United States halted joint exercises in the Philippines and
visits by U.S. military ships in December 1996, when the Manila
government ended a legal loophole that had shielded U.S. military
personnel from prosecution by the Philippines for crimes committed
here.
	   U.S. Defense Secretary William Cohen sought support for the
agreement in meetings with Estrada and other officials Monday.
	   Critics say the accord limits the Philippine government's right
to prosecute American soldiers who commit crimes. It generally
gives the United States jurisdiction over soldiers who commit
crimes while on duty, and the Philippines jurisdiction over crimes
committed while off-duty.
	   Military ties with the United States have remained a sensitive
issue since a nationalist Philippine Senate forced the closure of
the last U.S. base in the country in 1992, ending nearly a century
of American military presence in its former colony.

Singapore prime minister sends greetings to Indonesia's Habibie
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   SINGAPORE (AP) _ Singapore's prime minister invited Indonesian
President B.J. Habibie to visit and sent him warm greetings
Thursday, two days after Habibie had complained in a newspaper
interview that Singapore was unfriendly.
	   In hourly new reports throughout Thursday, government television
repeated that relations between the two countries were friendly.
	   Film was shown of Education Minister Teo Chee Hean delivering
medicine and food to Indonesia, and television reported that Goh's
greetings had been passed on to Habibie in a meeting at the
president's residence in Jakarta Thursday.
	   Goh's message congratulated Habibie for ``staying on top of a
most difficult situation'' and said the Indonesian president had
one of the most difficult jobs in the world at the moment, the
television reports said.
	   In an interview published in Tuesday's Asian Wall Street
Journal, Habibie had said Indonesia felt the friendship of
countries like the United States, Australia, China, Japan, Malaysia
and Europe, but not Singapore.
	   ``You see, a friend in need is a friend indeed,'' he said. ``I
don't have that feeling from Singapore. ... They are pro-active in
the negative direction.''
	   Habibie also had complained in the interview that after he
became president on May 21, he received congratulations from Goh
much later than from other leaders.
	   When Goh's May 25 letter was sent, it took the form of
expressing relief that a peaceful transition of government had
occurred and advising Habibie what was expected of his new
government. Singapore's government-run television had repeatedly
criticized Habibie and his record in the days leading up to his
inauguration.
	   Singapore's dissatisfaction with Habibie goes back to February,
when the Indonesian currency fell on the news that former President
Suharto was about to name him vice president.
	   Singapore's senior minister and undisputed authority figure, Lee
Kuan Yew, said in a Feb. 8 speech broadcast on state television
that the markets were disturbed by Suharto's criteria for vice
president. Habibie was subsequently named to the job and his
supporters protested at the Singapore Embassy over Lee's speech,
calling it interference in Indonesia's internal affairs.
	   In the Journal interview, Habibie appeared to refer to those
comments, saying, ``I would never character assassinate my friend
... and even my enemy, I would never character assassinate. It's
against my honor and culture.''

Ashrawi quits Palestinian Cabinet in protest over corruption
</HEADLINE>

 &UR; By SAMAR ASSAD &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   RAMALLAH, West Bank (AP) _ Hanan Ashrawi, a leading figure in
Palestinian politics, quit the government on Thursday, criticizing
Yasser Arafat's failure to crack down on corruption.
	   ``I will continue to serve and work as a (legislative) council
member, but not as a member of this government,'' she told a news
conference in the West Bank town of Ramallah.
	   Arafat announced a new Cabinet on Wednesday, a year after
legislators demanded the old one be dissolved because of widespread
corruption. But all of the ministers accused of corruption kept
their jobs.
	   Ashrawi, who ran for the legislature on an anti-corruption
campaign, was switched from minister of higher education, a post
she had held since 1996, to tourism minister.
	   She said she was declining the new post, telling reporters she
did so because ``I believe that comprehensive reform was not
addressed in this new government formulation.''
	   During Israeli-Palestinian peace negotiations in the early
1990s, Ashrawi gained a worldwide reputation as an articulate
spokeswoman for the Palestinian cause. She is also a well-known
human-rights and women's-rights activist.
	   A former professor of English at Bir Zeit University in the West
Bank town of Ramallah, Ashrawi headed the Independent Commission
for Human Rights until she won a seat in the Palestinian
Legislative Council in 1996.
	   She comes from a prominent Palestinian Christian family and has
published several books in both English and Arabic.

Russian government threatens to seize oil company assets
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ The government on Thursday threatened to seize the
assets and possibly reduce export quotas of three large oil
companies that have failed to pay back taxes.
	   Desperate to increase tax revenues, the government has toughened
its stance toward tax-dodging oil companies, which are among the
country's biggest export earners.
	   Russian oil companies Sidanko, Slavneft, Eastern Oil Company and
Onako have not paid taxes incurred between May and July, said
Vladimir Popov, a department head at the Federal Tax Service.
	   Sidanko, Eastern and Onako face the possible seizure of their
assets, Popov said, declining to explain why Slavneft did not.
	   The government has made similar threats against Russia's largest
companies before, but has not acted on them.
	   Sidanko owes the government 738 million rubles (about dlrs 120
million), Slavneft 337 million rubles (dlrs 54 million), Eastern
Oil 219 million rubles (dlrs 35 million) and Onako 214 million
rubles (dlrs 34 million), Popov told a news conference.
	   ``Yesterday we cabled regional tax offices to carry out
necessary measures, including the seizure of assets such as foreign
exchange and ruble accounts, as well as cars and holiday homes, to
force the companies to pay their obligations,'' Popov said. ``This
is something that will really hurt these people.''
	   Russia's tax collection figures have improved recently, but are
still lower than hoped for.
	   Tax receipts for August are expected to total 12.5 billion
rubles (dlrs 2 billion), up marginally from July, which was in turn
higher than June. But all three months will fall far short of the
target of 14.8 billion rubles (dlrs 2.3 billion), news report said.
	   Popov also said that the Ministry of Fuel and Energy may decide
to reduce Sidanko's and Onako's export quotas.
	   The government can control oil export quotas through the
state-owned pipeline operator Transneft.
	   In other economic developments Thursday, the Central Bank's
hard-currency reserves fell by dlrs 800 million in the last week of
July and stood at dlrs 18.4 billion on July 31, the bank announced
Thursday.
	   Also, the World Bank's board of directors in Washington was to
decide Thursday whether to release a dlrs 1.5 billion economic
restructuring loan to Russia, Interfax news agency reported.
	   If approved, the first dlrs 300 million installment would be
released immediately, and the second, dlrs 500 million installment
would follow before the end of the year.

Kabila's Congo threatens war against Rwanda
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: RECASTS to UPDATE with comments by Congolese government
spokesman, plans for public demonstration. Edits thruout. No
pickup.
 &UR; By KAMANGA MUTOND &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   KINSHASA, Congo (AP) _ Embattled by a widening rebellion in
eastern Congo, President Laurent Kabila's government threatened
Thursday to wage war against neighboring Rwanda, which it accused
of masterminding the uprising.
	   Government spokesman Didier Mumenge warned Thursday that Congo
would ``extend the war into Rwanda'' unless the international
community pressured the tiny country to withdraw Rwandan troops
allegedly deployed in Congo.
	   Speaking to reporters, Mumenge described Rwanda as a ``criminal
state'' that had meddled in foreign affairs while drawing on ``a
feeling of pity by the international community'' after the 1994
Rwandan genocide.
	   He was referring to the ethnic slaughter of more than half a
million people, mainly Tutsis, by Rwandan Hutu soldiers and
militants who were subsequently driven into hiding, from where they
have persistently attacked Rwanda's Tutsi-led government.
	   ``From now on the war will no longer be fought by the Congo
Armed Forces but that of all people in the Congo,'' Mumenge said.
	   The rebellion has sparked a backlash of anger by some residents
in Congo's capital of Kinshasa against Congolese Tutsis believed to
be receiving support from Rwanda.
	   On Tuesday several Kinshasa businesses owned by Tutsis were
reportedly robbed and burned by local residents after a
dusk-to-dawn curfew was lifted. Plans were being laid for a public
demonstration in the streets Thursday led by Tabu Ley and Tshala
Mwana, two popular musicians.
	   Rwanda has accused Congo of failing to control Hutu rebels, many
of whom set up bases in eastern Congo.
	   With the uprising emerging from troubled eastern Congo where
Kabila began his own revolution two years ago, the Congolese
president is faced by former allies in the biggest challenge to his
government so far.
	   The rebels are believed to include Banyamulenge _ Congolese
Tutsi fighters _ and Rwandan soldiers who remained in Congo after
playing a key role in Kabila's victory over longtime Zairian
dictator Mobutu Sese Seko last year.
	   The renegades have seized control of the key cities of Bukavu
and Goma near Rwanda's border and fighting was reported in Uvira
and Kisangani further into the interior, government and rebel
sources said.
	   The victories were accompanied by persistent accusations that
neighboring Rwanda sent troops into Congo and is orchestrating the
rebellion.
	   ``Almost 400 army soldiers have come from Rwanda and have caused
Congolese bloodshed,'' Mumengi said Wednesday.
	   But a leader of the mutineers speaking on a rebel radio station
denied Rwandan involvement.
	   ``This is a struggle of the Congolese people,'' said Arthur
Z'Ahidi Ngoma, a veteran opposition figure who was at one time
briefly jailed by Kabila's regime.
	   Ngoma was named rebel leader by a group of former government
supporters, opposition officials and soldiers in the eastern town
of Goma on Tuesday night, according to the rebel-held broadcaster.
	   Rwanda's President Pasteur Bizimungu denied Wednesday his
country was involved in the conflict, but was noncommittal about
whether it would intervene in the future.

Argentine international signs with Gunners
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ Argentine international Nelson Vivas is expected
to make his Premier League debut for Arsenal in its Charity Shield
clash with Manchester United at Wembley on Sunday.
	   The 28-year-old defender on Thursday completed his move to
Highbury from Swiss club Lugano, where he was playing on loan from
Argentine club, Boca Juniors.
	   Vivas is Arsenal's first major signing since it clinched the FA
Cup and League championship double last season.
	   Vivas, who played on the Argentina team which knocked England
out of the France '98 World Cup, has 32 caps for his country.
	   Arsenal manager Arsene Wenger said Vivas would strengthen the
Gunners' defensive strike power.
	   ``Nelson is an experienced, versatile footballer and will play a
pivotal role in this year's domestic and European campaigns,''
Wenger said.
	   Vivas said he had many offers after the World Cup but the chance
to play for Arsenal was too good to miss.
	   ``Boca Juniors wanted to take me back but I wanted to stay with
the Arsenal option,'' he said.
	   Vivas said playing the World Cup was the fulfilment of a dream
and playing in the Premier League would be the fulfilment of
another.
	   ``When you play professional football in Argentina you are
always looking towards Europe and of course, England is one of the
most important places,'' he said.
	   ``I was very proud to represent my country in the World Cup and
I will be equally proud to play in England.''

Cambodian leader suggests keeping critic in opposition
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By KER MUNTHIT &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   PHNOM PENH, Cambodia (AP) _ One day after his party was
announced as the winner of last week's election, Cambodian leader
Hun Sen said Thursday it would be better to keep at least one major
political party out of his government so as to provide a strong
parliamentary opposition.
	   In an interview with Radio Australia's Khmer-language service,
he indicated that he might withdraw an offer he made last week to
include Sam Rainsy, an outspoken opposition party leader, in a
coalition government.
	   Hun Sen had invited both Sam Rainsy and Prince Norodom
Ranariddh, head of the FUNCINPEC party, to join him in a ruling
coalition.
	   The opposition leaders said they wouldn't even consider the
offer until their complaints of election irregularities and fraud
were investigated.
	   ``The presence of all parties with seats in the parliament in
the government would end the role of opposition,'' Hun Sen said.
``There ought to be an opposition in the National Assembly.''
	   Pending recounts of some votes, Hun Sen's Cambodian People's
Party appears to have won 64 seats in the 122-seat National
Assembly, short of the two-thirds majority needed to form a
government on its own.
	   Ranariddh's FUNCINPEC, Hun Sen's main challenger, would hold 43
seats in the new parliament and the Sam Rainsy Party 15.
	   Ranariddh and Sam Rainsy have said that their parties were
prepared to boycott the National Assembly if their complaints of
election fraud were not properly addressed.
	   Hun Sen and his party maintain that the election was free and
fair.
	   ``I can proudly say that no election will be more free than this
one,'' Hun Sen said in his interview, which was rebroadcast on
Cambodian radio. ``It's more than free in Cambodia when 39 parties
and 5 million people took part in it.''
	   The July 26 election came one year after Hun Sen ousted
Ranariddh as his co-prime minister in a violent coup, shattering a
tense dual premiership formed after U.N.-sponsored elections.
	   Hun Sen has never been known to embrace his political opponents
and has been accused by his critics of orchestrating a grenade
attack on a peaceful demonstration led by Sam Rainsy last year.
Sixteen people were killed and more than 100 injured, although Sam
Rainsy escaped unharmed.

Parliament extends state of emergency in tsunami region
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   PORT MORESBY, Papua New Guinea (AP) _ Papua New Guinea's
parliament voted Thursday to continue a state of emergency in the
region devastated by a tsunami.
	   Legislators accepted a recommendation from a parliamentary
emergency committee that the state of emergency be extended for
another two months for public health reasons. The report also
recommended that the area covered by the state of emergency be
scaled down.
	   ``The committee was of the view that the extension was needed to
prevent the movement of people in and out of the disaster areas
where such areas were still unhealthy due to decaying corpses,''
the committee's report said.
	   Prime Minister Bill Skate declared a state of emergency in the
Aitape district of West Sepik province, on Papua New Guinea's
northwest coast, on July 22.
	   A 10-meter (33-foot)-high tsunami devastated a 22-mile
(35-kilometer) stretch of coast west of the town of Aitape on July
17, killing more than 2,000 people and leaving thousands homeless.
Fearing disease outbreaks, authorities sealed off Sissano Lagoon in
the region, leaving many unrecovered bodies to rot or be eaten by
wild animals.
	   The parliamentary report recommended the emergency be scaled
down to cover a smaller area around Aitape and that an authority be
established to oversee reconstruction in the region.
	   The report said the government should buy land in the area to
resettle thousands of people left homeless by the disaster and that
the number of defense and police personnel be reduced to a skeleton
staff of medics, communications personnel and a mobile police
squad.

International forensics exhume new bodies in eastern Bosnia
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   SARAJEVO, Bosnia-Herzegovina (AP) _ International forensic
experts have exhumed 70 new bodies of Muslims massacred during the
war in eastern Bosnia, United Nations officials said Thursday.
	   Some of the bodies found were blindfolded and with hands tied
behind their backs, said Alexander Ivanko, a U.N. spokesman.
	   That supports eyewitness reports that said Bosnian Serb soldiers
conducted mass executions of Muslim war prisoners after the fall of
the former eastern enclave of Srebrenica.
	   Some 7,000 people, mainly men, are missing and presumed dead
dead from when the Bosnian Serbs overran the enclave in the summer
of 1995.
	   Ivanko said the international forensic experts have exhumed more
than 400 bodies in several mass graves between Zvornik and
Srebrenica.
	   The investigators have also discovered that, in an attempt to
hide the slaughter, many bodies were removed from mass graves and
reburied in more than 20 so-called secondary sites identified in
the area.
	   Meanwhile, the Bosnian Serb interior ministry has completed an
investigation into a number of harassment and beating incidents
involving Serb policemen against non-Serb citizens in the central
Bosnian town of Teslic in the past year, Ivanko said.
	   Disciplinary actions have been suggested against 35 police
officers. Additional crime reports were filed against 10 policemen
from the same group, he said.
	   ``I think this is the first such action of the Bosnian Serb
police,'' Ivanko said.

Netanyahu reportedly irks Vatican by pushing choice for church
</HEADLINE>
post &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu acknowledged
Thursday he had discussed the upcoming appointment of a Greek
Catholic archbishop in Israel with church officials _ an unusual
step for a politician.
	   The Israeli newspaper Maariv said that Netanyahu made it clear
to leaders of the Greek Catholic church he wanted Emil Shufani, a
bishop considered friendly to the Israeli government, to be
appointed the archbishop in the Galilee.
	   Maariv reported that the Vatican was unhappy over what was seen
as inappropriate political interference in a Holy See appointment.
Pope John Paul II picked another bishop, Butros Mualem, to the
position.
	   The Vatican had no immediate comment on the matter.
	   The Greek Catholic community in the largest Christian community
in Israel and _ like the Latin Orthodox church _ considers the pope
its supreme authority. The archbishop is the highest-ranking
regional authority for the Greek Catholic community.
	   An Israeli security official, speaking on condition of
anonymity, said it was feared that Mualem, a Palestinian refugee,
might incite the Catholic community against Israel.
	   According to the official, Yasser Arafat's Palestinian Authority
pressured the local church council to recommend Mualem for the
appointment, and it was in response to this that Netanyahu decided
to get involved.
	   ``Israel, as the sovereign authority... expressed its position
to the church,'' said Aviv Bushinsky, Netanyahu's spokesman. He
refused to elaborate.
	   Rabbi David Rosen, director of the Anti-Defamation League, said
a government attempt to influence a church appointment was ``almost
unheard of'' and could jeopardize Israel's relations with the
Vatican.
	   ``It is rare and unusual for a democratic government to become
involved in such an appointment... and this unfortunately may cast
a shadow over our relations with the Catholic world,'' said Rosen,
who was one of the key negotiators of the 1993 Israeli-Vatican
diplomatic accords.
	   Israel and the Vatican forged diplomatic relations in 1993, and
Pope John Paul II has made improving relations with Jews a
priority. Earlier this year, he made a long-awaited statement of
remorse for the role of the Roman Catholic Church during the
Holocaust.

<TEXT>
	   SOFIA, Bulgaria (AP) _ Todor Zhivkov, Bulgaria's Communist
dictator for 35 years and the Soviet bloc's last surviving
Stalinist leader, has died, officials announced Thursday. He was
86.
	   Zhivkov died Wednesday night in a Sofia hospital, the office of
Bulgaria's reformist president, Petar Stoyanov, announced. Zhivkov
had fallen into a coma after being hospitalized July 8 with a
respiratory infection, officials at Losenets Hospital were quoted
by the official BTA news agency as saying. He also had suffered
from diabetes and other ailments in recent months.
	   Zhivkov held the record among his eastern European peers for
time in office _ from 1954 until his fall in the anti-communist
revolutions of 1989.
	   Stoyanov expressed his condolences Thursday to Zhivkov's family
but said in a public statement that Zhivkov oversaw ``one of the
darkest periods of recent Bulgarian history.''
	   ``Eight million Bulgarians lived during that long period with
their work, dreams and illusions, but also in fear and political
repression,'' Stoyanov said. ``With the death of Todor Zhivkov the
era of Bulgarian communism is finally ending.''
	   Zhivkov outlived his former Kremlin bosses and other Balkan
dictators: Yugoslavia's Josip Broz Tito died in 1980, and Albania's
Enver Hoxha in 1985. Romania's Nicolae Ceausescu was executed in
1989.
	   His longevity at Bulgaria's helm was largely based on such
absolute servility to Moscow that Zhivkov once proposed that
Bulgaria should merge with the Soviet Union.
	   In this, he was exceptional. Even the leaders of other Soviet
satellites in eastern Europe occasionally demonstrated varying
degrees of independence, or were slow in switching to the latest
orientation of their Soviet masters.
	   Zhivkov dealt mercilessly with dissent, imprisoning thousands of
people in the Lovech and Skravena prison camps in the 1950s and
1960s.
	   ``He served the Soviet Union more ardently than the Soviet
leaders themselves did,'' wrote Georgi Markov, a defector working
for the BBC in London. In 1978, Markov was slain _ most likely by
Bulgarian agents _ with a special umbrella that injected him with a
tiny poison vial.
	   Zhivkov was born into a poor family in Pravets, near Sofia, on
Sept. 7, 1911. Like others who rose to Communist heights after
World War II, Zhivkov came from a rural background.
	   He was part of a generation that got its first education after
World War I dissolved the Ottoman and Habsburg empires that had
ruled the Balkans for centuries. His learning led him to embrace
revolution, and Zhivkov joined Bulgaria's illegal Communist Party
in 1932.
	   His meteoric rise through the party ranks started in 1944, when
the Bulgarian Communists seized power with the backing of the Red
Army. In 1954, he became first secretary of Bulgaria's staunchly
Stalinist Communist Party.
	   Bulgaria's course meshed tightly with Moscow's until the late
1980s, when Soviet dogmatism eased under Mikhail Gorbachev _ a man
Zhivkov despised until his death for what he said was Gorbachev's
betrayal of the hard-line communist cause.
	   In 1956, Zhivkov demonstrated his loyalty to Nikita Khrushchev
by siding with him in his condemnation of Josef Stalin. With the
same ease, he allied with Leonid Brezhnev and other Moscow
hard-liners when they ousted Khrushchev in 1964.
	   In 1965, Zhivkov crushed an attempt by some Bulgarian Communists
to yank the country from its increasingly tight Soviet orbit,
declaring afterward that he was ``with the Soviet Union for life or
death!''
	   Years after Zhivkov himself was ousted, he admitted that ``all
Soviet leaders made mistakes.''
	   The best Soviet leader among the many he worked with was
Khrushchev, he said. The worst: Mikhail Gorbachev, ``who betrayed
us and sold us'' by precipitating the collapse of an empire.
	   For decades, the Bulgarian people feared ``Papa'' Zhivkov.
	   An attempt to groom his daughter Ludmila as heir ended with her
death under unclear circumstances in 1981.
	   In the mid-1980s, as the country's debt-ridden economy started
to collapse, Zhivkov tried to whip up nationalist support by
cracking down on Bulgaria's Turkish minority, making them change
their names to Bulgarian-sounding ones. About 320,000 people
eventually fled to Turkey.
	   But with the advent of Gorbachev's reforms, Zhivkov's grip on
power started to slip. Unlike Gorbachev, Zhivkov could not blame
predecessors for past mistakes.
	   Zhivkov was ousted as head of the communist party in 1989 and
replaced as president of Bulgaria.
	   He was arrested the following year on charges of
misappropriating state funds. He was sentenced in 1991 to seven
years in prison, but his failing health meant he never went to
jail. Instead, he spent his final years under house arrest.
	   In 1998, Zhivkov was suddenly reinstated as a member of the
Socialist party, which succeeded the Communists, and found himself
able to alarm rivals and inspire rousing ovations again.
	   ``Because of my age, I would prefer that people choose someone
who is younger,'' he told the AP this year. ``But they can't free
themselves from thinking about me. That's the psychology of the
people.''
	   Zhivkov is survived by his son, Vladimir, who lives in Sofia.
State radio said the funeral would be held Sunday afternoon in the
Bulgarian capital.

Ashrawi quits Palestinian Cabinet in protest

 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with Ashrawi criticizing handling of negotiations &QL;

 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   RAMALLAH, West Bank (AP) _ Hanan Ashrawi, a leading figure in
Palestinian politics, quit the government on Thursday, criticizing
Yasser Arafat over corruption and handling of peace talks.
	   ``I will continue to serve and work as a (legislative) council
member, but not as a member of this government,'' she told a news
conference in the West Bank town of Ramallah.
	   Arafat announced a new Cabinet on Wednesday, a year after
legislators demanded the old one be dissolved because of widespread
corruption. But all of the ministers accused of corruption kept
their jobs.
	   Ashrawi, who had been minister of higher education since 1996,
said she declined to accept a new appointment as tourism minister
because ``I believe that comprehensive reform was not addressed in
this new government formulation.''
	   ``I assured Arafat that once he conducts ...genuine reform, I
will be willing to help him,'' said Ashrawi, who ran for the
legislature on an anti-corruption platform.
	   Ashrawi also said she was unhappy with the handling of peace
talks with Israel.
	   ``I am not happy with the conduct of the negotiations,'' she
said. ``I could not continue to look the other way.''
	   During Israeli-Palestinian peace negotiations in the early
1990s, Ashrawi gained a worldwide reputation as an articulate
spokeswoman for the Palestinian cause. She is also a well-known
human-rights and women's-rights activist.
	   A former professor of English at Bir Zeit University in the West
Bank town of Ramallah, Ashrawi headed the Independent Commission
for Human Rights until she won a seat in the Palestinian
Legislative Council in 1996.
	   She comes from a prominent Palestinian Christian family and has
published several books in both English and Arabic.

Cash incentives offered for Asian club soccer teams
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia (AP) _ For the first time, soccer teams
that advance past the first round of the Asian Club Championship
will receive cash rewards, the Asian Football Confederation said
Thursday.
	   Teams that qualify for the second round of the 1998-1999 event
will receive dlrs 5,000. Those that advance to the quarterfinals
will receive dlrs 10,000, AFC General Secretary Peter Veleppan said
in a statement.
	   ``We are committed to doing everything possible to ensure club
football gets the support it needs,'' said Veleppan, adding that
many of the clubs lacked sufficient funds.
	   ``By providing them with cash incentives, we hope first to see a
further improvement in the quality of their game.''
	   The AFC will also pay full expenses for referees and officials
during the championship, an expense previously absorbed by the host
team, the statement said.
	   The 18th edition of the Asian Club Championship begins Aug. 8 in
South Korea.

Two Somali factions agree to stop fighting
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MOGADISHU, Somalia (AP) _ Two Somalia factions agreed in 20 days
of negotiations to a deal to bring peace to their country's border
region with Ethiopia.
	   Their pact was a small step towards fostering peace throughout
Somalia, which has been at war since 1991 when rival clans turned
on each other after driving dictator Mohamed Siad Barre from power.
	   The Somalia National Front and Al-Itihad Al-Islam, or Islamic
Unity, agreed to a six-point plan to stop fighting for control of
the western Gedo region, representatives of the two sides told
journalists in a radio call to the Mogadishu on Wednesday.
	   The pact also calls for the two sides to work together to remove
land mines from roads so trade can resume. They agreed to adopt the
Somali National Front's political emblem for the region and to
impose Islam laws.
	   They also agreed to seek peace with Ethiopia.
	   Al-Itihad Al-Islam has fought since 1992 for the unification of
the southeastern Ethiopian Ogaden region with Somalia. Ogaden is
populated by ethnic Somalis.
	   The Muslim group has been accused of bomb attacks in Ethiopia,
including in the capital Addis Ababa. In retaliation, Ethiopian
forces have crossed into Somalia's Gedo region at least twice in
the past two years.

Schering posts profits despite sharp sales decline in Asia
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BERLIN (AP) _ German pharmaceuticals maker Schering reported a 7
percent increase in net profits for the first half of 1998 on
Thursday, despite a steep sales decline in Asia, one of its key
markets.
	   Schering said sales in southeastern Asia fell 34 percent in the
six months ended June 30. However, group sales overall rose nearly
4 percent to 3.1 billion marks (1.74 billion dollars), due mainly
to strong sales of Betaferon, which treats the relapsing-remitting
form of multiple sclerosis.
	   Schering's net profit of 315 million marks (dlrs 177 million)
was in line with analysts' expectations of a 5-7 percent increase.

Low oil prices, Asia crisis cause 17 percent profit drop
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   AMSTERDAM, Netherlands (AP) _ Hit by low oil prices and Asia's
economic crisis, the Royal Dutch Shell Group of Cos. said Wednesday
that its net income fell 17 percent to dlrs 1.6 billion in the
second quarter.
	   Earnings for the three months ended June 30 were at the lower
end of the dlrs 1.6 billion to dlrs 1.8 billion range forecast by
analysts. In the same period a year ago, the Anglo-Dutch giant
posted a profit of dlrs 1.9 billion.
	   Shares of Shell, one of the world's biggest energy companies,
were trading down 3.3 percent by midday Wednesday.
	   The 26 percent fall in crude oil prices adversely affected
exploration and production earnings despite a 4 percent rise in
output from second quarter 1997 levels, Shell said. Gas sales were
lower mainly due to warmer weather in Europe.
	   Shell said the outlook for oil prices depends on whether members
of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries follow through
on their June agreement to cut output.
	   Sales of oil products rose 1 percent, but earnings were offset
in part by Asia's economic turmoil, Shell said.
	   ``The outlook for Asia-Pacific refining margins is one of
continued weakness,'' it said. U.S. and European refining margins
should remain steady unless the effects of the Asian economic
slowdown filters through more strongly into Western markets, Shell
added.
	   Chemicals volumes increased, but those earnings also fell due to
reduced demand in Asia and increased industry supply. ``Globally,
the outlook for the second half of the year is for further
deterioration,'' Shell said.
	   Shell's total second quarter sales fell to dlrs 34.7 billion
from dlrs 41.8 billion a year ago. First-half sales fell to dlrs
70.5 billion from dlrs 86.5 billion in the previous year, while
first-half net income fell to dlrs 3.5 billion from dlrs 4.4
billion.
	   Shell does not announce its interim dividend until Sept. 10.

	   A summary of financial and business news from The Associated
Press at 1100 GMT. Stories carry ``f'' or ``i'' category codes and
move on this circuit in expanded form:
	   HONG KONG (AP) _ Wall Street's overnight recovery provided a
brief respite for Asia on Thursday, but financial markets only
paused before continuing their downward spiral. Most Asian markets
opened quietly Thursday, and many initially followed the Dow,
posting small gains. The good feelings wore off quickly because of
local worries and the renewed weakness of the Japanese yen against
the dollar. In Hong Kong, the earnings report for conglomerate
Swire Pacific added to the string of bad news on corporate earnings
and the gross domestic product that drove the market down almost 6
percent in the first three days of the week. Swire Pacific reported
a 39 percent decline in profits for the first half of the year. The
key Hang Seng index shed another 212 points, or 2.8 percent,
Thursday to close at 7,254.36. Hong Kong markets also were spooked
by fears of an attack by currency speculators on the Hong Kong
dollar, which forced up interbank interest rates. In Tokyo, the
Nikkei index was flat in early trading, but fell more sharply as
the day went on, closing down almost 116 points, or 0.72 percent,
at 15,876.22. (ASIAN MARKETS)
	   BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) _ More than a thousand Thais will lose
their jobs when one of Southeast Asia's largest rubber firms shuts
down its curing plants next week, company officials said Thursday.
Teck Bee Hang Company will shut down 12 rubber curing plants in
Thailand's southern provinces on August 15. Company officials said
employees will receive severance pay. Unemployment in Thailand is
expected to reach 2.2 million this year as the effects of the
country's worst economic crisis in modern times hits home. Thailand
is the world's largest rubber producer, followed by Indonesia and
Malaysia. (THAILAND-PLANTS CLOSE)
	   TOKYO (AP) _ Tax cuts. New spending. A massive bank bailout.
Japan's new government is plowing ahead this week with a
three-point program to patch up the ailing economy and win over the
markets. Prime Minister Keizo Obuchi, elected premier just last
week by Parliament, was to lay out the details of his plan in his
first policy speech before the legislature on Friday. The speech
was to contain the same points he made in his campaign and since
winning his post: 6 trillion yen (dlrs 41.7 billion) or more in tax
cuts, 10 trillion yen (dlrs 69.4 billion) in new spending and moves
to clean up bad bank debts. But with unemployment hitting a record
high of 4.3 percent and expected to go higher, some critics say
pumping more money into the system will not lead to the deep

	   NUREMBERG, Germany (AP) _ The number of Germans without work
rose slightly in July but the increase was less than in previous
years, signaling an improvement in the jobs market, the federal
Labor Office said Thursday. The unemployment rate rose to 10.7
percent, or 4.13 million, in July, from 10.5 percent a month
earlier. The increase was due entirely to seasonal factors, Labor
Office vice president Klaus Leven said, meaning that the jobs
picture overall in Germany was showing signs of improvement.
Joblessness continues to be more severe in the former East Germany,
at 17.4 percent, compared with a rate of 9.1 percent in the western
part of the country. (GERMANY-UNEMPLOYMENT)
	   PARIS (AP) _ French carmaker Renault said Thursday its 1998
sales for the first half of the year reached 122 billion francs
(dlrs 20 billion), an increase of 22 percent over the same period
last year. The company attributed the healthy earnings to the
success of the Megane, the Clio II and the passenger car and light
commercial version of the Kango. Renault said the company's sales
volume rose 17 percent to just over a million cars and commercial
light vehicles, giving it a 30 percent market share in France.

	   A summary of late news from The Associated Press. Some items
have moved on this circuit in expanded form with ``i'' or ``f''
category codes:
	   BAGHDAD, Iraq (AP) _ Iraq stopped a team of U.N. inspectors from
carrying out searches for banned weapons in Baghdad on Thursday, an
Iraqi official said, threatening to reignite a dispute that nearly
led to war six months ago. It was the most defiant Iraqi gesture
since a crisis over weapons searches at presidential compounds was
resolved in February, averting a possible U.S. and British military
strike. Thursday's step came a day after President Saddam Hussein
froze cooperation with inspectors to protest eight years of
economic sanctions. The decision will likely return the issue of
U.N. sanctions to international attention and could renew a
confrontation with the United States. (IRAQ)
	   BEIJING (AP) _ More than 2,000 people have died in China's long
season of summer flooding, the government announced Thursday,
raising the previously estimated death toll by 700. More than 90
percent of those killed between June and Aug. 3 were crushed in
landslides and mud flows that buried houses and farms in several
parts of the country, according to information released by the
Ministry of Civil Affairs at a news conference. The ministry did
not say where the new casualties were reported. Floods caused by
rains that fell earlier and heavier than usual have lifted the
Yangtze River to its highest level since 1954, when catastrophic
flooding killed 30,000 people. This year's death toll is the
highest since summer floods in 1991. (CHINA-FLOODS)
	   HIROSHIMA, Japan (AP) _ Japan's prime minister used the 53rd
anniversary of the bombing of Hiroshima on Thursday to urge India
and Pakistan to stop their nuclear weapons testing programs. ``It
is very regrettable that both India and Pakistan carried out
nuclear tests in May,'' said Premier Keizo Obuchi, who took office
last month and presided over the solemn annual ceremony marking the
world's first atomic attack. Speaking to tens of thousands of
people in Hiroshima _ including the Indian and Pakistani
ambassadors _ Obuchi said the Japanese government strongly urged
both countries to immediately stop nuclear testing, to
unconditionally sign the comprehensive test ban treaty, and to halt
development of nuclear weapons and the missiles that carry them.

	   WASHINGTON (AP) _ After a week of emotionally wrenching
preparation, Monica Lewinsky wrapped up her last session with
prosecutors and was ready to tell a grand jury Thursday her account
of a White House affair that could alter the course of Bill
Clinton's presidency. Ms. Lewinsky spent Wednesday going over her
testimony with Independent Counsel Kenneth Starr's staff one last
time, and both sides agreed at day's end she was ready for her
scheduled appearance, a source familiar with the preparations said.
The source, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said Ms. Lewinsky,
25, was eager to put the grand jury appearance behind her and tell
the truth, but at times found it difficult or awkward to talk about
the deeply personal details of a relationship with Clinton that she
claims involved sexual activity inside the White House.

	   DILI, Indonesia (AP) _ After withdrawing hundreds of combat
troops from East Timor, Indonesia's military said Thursday it had
sent 263 army health personnel and police to the troubled
territory. The local military chief, Col. Tono Suratman, said the
newcomers would help the former Portuguese colony in its
development. At a welcoming ceremony, he said the troops _ one
company each of the army and police _ would not engage in combat or
intelligence operations. The troops, including 155 army officers
with specialties in health and mental counselling, arrived
Wednesday night aboard a navy ship. The remaining 108 are from
police's special force of mobile brigade. (INDONESIA-EAST TIMOR)

France condemns Iraqi decision to bar UNSCOM inspectors
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   PARIS (AP) _ Iraq's decision to end cooperation with U.N.
weapons inspectors is ``unacceptable,'' the French Foreign Ministry
said in a statement Thursday.
	   ``France asks Iraq not to implement its decision,'' the Foreign
Ministry statement said.
	   Iraqi President Saddam Hussein on Wednesday halted cooperation
with U.N. weapons inspectors to protest economic sanctions in
effect since the Gulf War.
	   The French Foreign Ministry reminded Iraq that the U.N. weapons
inspectors had almost finished their work and that lifting of the
sanctions was in sight.
	   France supports an end to sanctions.

Russian government threatens to seize oil company assets
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES in graf 10 with total tax debt figures. &QL; 
 &UR; By ANNA DOLGOV &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ The government on Thursday threatened to seize the
assets and possibly reduce export quotas of three large oil
companies that have failed to pay back taxes.
	   Desperate to increase tax revenues, the government has toughened
its stance toward tax-dodging oil companies, which are among the
country's biggest export earners.
	   Russian oil companies Sidanko, Slavneft, Eastern Oil Company and
Onako have not paid taxes incurred between May and July, said
Vladimir Popov, a department head at the Federal Tax Service.
	   Sidanko, Eastern and Onako face the possible seizure of their
assets, Popov said, declining to explain why Slavneft did not.
	   The government has made similar threats against Russia's largest
companies before, but has not acted on them.
	   Sidanko owes the government 738 million rubles (about dlrs 120
million), Slavneft 337 million rubles (dlrs 54 million), Eastern
Oil 219 million rubles (dlrs 35 million) and Onako 214 million
rubles (dlrs 34 million), Popov told a news conference.
	   ``Yesterday we cabled regional tax offices to carry out
necessary measures, including the seizure of assets such as foreign
exchange and ruble accounts, as well as cars and holiday homes, to
force the companies to pay their obligations,'' Popov said. ``This
is something that will really hurt these people.''
	   Popov also said that the Ministry of Fuel and Energy may decide
to reduce Sidanko's and Onako's export quotas.
	   The government can control oil export quotas through the
state-owned pipeline operator Transneft.
	   Russia's tax collection figures have improved recently, but are
still lower than hoped for.
	   Tax receipts for August are expected to total 12.5 billion
rubles (dlrs 2 billion), up marginally from July. But the figure
will still fall short of the target of 14.8 billion rubles (dlrs
2.3 billion), news report said.
	   Meanwhile, tax debts to the federal budget reached 234.2 billion
rubles (dlrs 37 billion) on July 1, rising 37 percent from the end
of last year, Popov said. Total debts, including fines for unpaid
taxes, reached 445.2 billion rubles (dlrs 72 billion), he said.
	   In other economic developments Thursday, the Central Bank's
hard-currency reserves fell by dlrs 800 million in the last week of
July and stood at dlrs 18.4 billion on July 31, the bank announced
Thursday.
	   Also, the World Bank's board of directors in Washington was to
decide Thursday whether to release a dlrs 1.5 billion economic
restructuring loan to Russia, Interfax news agency reported.

Iraq stops inspection team from carrying out duties
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with IAEA saying Iraq will bar it from carrying out
surprise inspections, background in grafs 8-11.
 &UR; By LEON BARKHO &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   BAGHDAD, Iraq (AP) _ Iraq stopped a team of U.N. weapons
inspectors Thursday from carrying out searches in Baghdad, an Iraqi
official said, threatening to reignite a dispute that nearly led to
war six months ago.
	   The move came a day after President Saddam Hussein froze
cooperation with inspectors to protest eight years of economic
sanctions. It was the most defiant Iraqi gesture since a crisis
over searches of presidential compounds was resolved in February,
averting a possible U.S. and British military strike.
	   The decision will likely return the issue of U.N. sanctions to
international attention and could renew a confrontation with the
United States. After Saddam's announcement, U.S. officials had said
they would wait to see what happened when inspectors tried to work.
	   The U.N. team was stopped when Iraqi escorts refused to
accompany it in its search Thursday in Baghdad, the official said.
Without them, U.N. teams are unable to conduct their work.
	   In the past, the Iraqis have withheld escorts for the U.N. teams
as a way of impeding the inspections, which are usually carried out
as surprise visits.
	   The U.N. team was not allowed to conduct ``discussions with
Iraqi authorities on arms or visits to sites or searches for past
weapons,'' the official told The Associated Press.
	   The Iraqi News Agency, however, said no team was banned from
doing its work. It did not say whether escorts were denied. U.N.
officials would not comment on the report that a team was blocked
from working.
	   Meantime, the International Atomic Energy Agency was told it
could no longer carry out surprise inspections of Iraq's nuclear
program.
	   ``We have been told by the government of Iraq that our
activities will be limited to certain declared sites. This is not
acceptable and we are contacting the president of the Security
Council,'' said David Kyd, an IAEA spokesman in Vienna, Austria.
	   Iraq has sought to shift the job of the United Nations and IAEA
from inspections of potentially clandestine sites to monitoring
places already searched, a proposal backed by Russia in the
Security Council last month. The United States headed off the move.
	   As a result, the government has allowed monitoring of the
inspected sites to continue. About 460 sites in Iraq have been
inspected and are under monitoring. About 100 U.N. experts visit
the sites or use remote-controlled cameras and sensors as part of a
surveillance system set up in 1994.
	   On Thursday, U.N. spokesman Janet Sullivan told the AP that
``ongoing monitoring continues.'' However, the U.N. later refused
to take queries on a team being blocked.
	   Convoys of U.N. vehicles carrying the monitors left the Canal
Hotel on Baghdad's eastern outskirts followed by a similar number
of cars of Iraqi officials. No one interfered with their work.
	   The move Thursday followed a breakdown in talks between Iraq and
the United Nations over the inspections. Chief U.N. weapons
inspector Richard Butler left Baghdad on Monday and was scheduled
to brief the U.N. Security Council later Thursday.
	   The government statement Wednesday said Saddam had decided to
``completely suspend cooperation'' with the U.N. Special Commission
and the International Atomic Energy Agency.
	   It said monitoring activities would be allowed on the condition
that U.N. ``personnel carry out the monitoring strictly respecting
Iraq's sovereignty, security and its people's dignity.''
	   Government-run newspapers lauded Saddam's decision.
	   ``Our people will accept nothing less than the lifting of
sanctions,'' Al-Qadissiya newspaper said Thursday.
	   The sanctions were imposed after Iraq's 1990 invasion of Kuwait
and have crippled the economy by banning the free sale of oil, the
country's economic mainstay.
	   To lift them, inspectors must certify Iraq's weapons of mass
destruction have been dismantled. Inspectors have been searching,
monitoring and accounting for Iraq's chemical and biological arms,
nuclear program and long-range missiles since 1991.

Iran to close diplomatic missions abroad
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   TEHRAN, Iran (AP) _ Iran plans to close down some of its
diplomatic missions abroad as part of an austerity plan aimed at
reducing government spending, the Tehran Times reported Thursday.
	   ``The plan for reducing the number of Iranian missions abroad
and curtailing their staff will be given top priority,'' the
English-language paper quoted Foreign Ministry spokesman Mohammad
Mohammadi as saying.
	   Mohammadi said missions would be closed in countries ``which do
not have friendly relations with Iran and those which do not have
significant economic cooperation with our country.''
	   But he did not name the countries or say when the plan would go
into effect.
	   Iran, like other Gulf oil producers, has been grappling with
rising budget deficits because of low prices for oil, a main source
of government revenues.
	   On Sunday, Iranian President Mohammad Khatami called for
encouraging foreign investment and cutting the country's reliance
on oil revenues as part of his economic plan.

EU approves dlrs 5.5 million in aid for Kosovo
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BRUSSELS, Belgium (AP) - The European Union approved 5 million
European currency units (dlrs 5.5 million) in aid Thursday for
Kosovo, where thousands of people have been displaced by clashes
between Serb troops and separatists.
	   The EU Commission said the funds will enable the United Nations
and humanitarian groups to take urgent steps to help people fleeing
fighting in the Serbian province.
	   The conflict has ``intensified dramatically during the summer,''
a commission statement said.
	   ``Altogether 13,000 displaced persons have fled to Albania,
27,000 to Montenegro, close to 2,000 to Macedonia. There are also
over 100,000 displaced persons inside Kosovo,'' the statement said.
	   The funds will be used primarily to supply these people with
basic needs such as food, medicine, shelter, and the material they
will need to make it through the coming winter.
	   Kosovo, which has 2 million people, has been wracked by violence
for several months since Serbian President Sloboban Milosevic sent
forces into the province to crush ethnic Albanians seeking

Malaysian police fire tear gas at illegal immigrants
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia (AP) _ Malaysian police fired tear gas at
a group of 76 illegal immigrants, armed with iron rods, to force
them from a hiding spot on top of a housing project Thursday, a
news report said.
	   Police spokesman Abdul Wahab Harun said the 3 a.m. attack came
after a five-hour standoff with the group of 71 Indonesians, four
Bangladeshis and one Indian, who did not have travel or work
permits and refused to surrender.
	   For the past month, Abdul Wahab said, the illegal immigrants had
occupied a 10-story housing project under construction near the
capital, Kuala Lumpur, the government news agency Bernama reported.
	   Malaysia has deported more than 30,000 illegal foreign workers,
mainly Indonesians, as part of a nationwide sweep intended to free
up jobs for local people during the economic turmoil.
	   The government has said it expects to deport 200,000 illegal
Indonesian immigrants by Aug. 15.

International forensics exhume new bodies in eastern Bosnia
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   SARAJEVO, Bosnia-Herzegovina (AP) _ International forensic
experts have exhumed 70 new bodies of Muslims massacred during the
war in eastern Bosnia, United Nations officials said Thursday.
	   Some of the bodies found were blindfolded and with hands tied
behind their backs, said Alexander Ivanko, a U.N. spokesman.
	   That supports eyewitness reports that said Bosnian Serb soldiers
conducted mass executions of Muslim war prisoners after the fall of
the former eastern enclave of Srebrenica.
	   Some 7,000 people, mainly men, are missing and presumed dead
dead from when the Bosnian Serbs overran the enclave in the summer
of 1995.
	   Ivanko said the international forensic experts have exhumed more
than 400 bodies in several mass graves between Zvornik and
Srebrenica.
	   The investigators have also discovered that, in an attempt to
hide the slaughter, many bodies were removed from mass graves and
reburied in more than 20 so-called secondary sites identified in
the area.
	   Meanwhile, the Bosnian Serb interior ministry has completed an
investigation into a number of harassment and beating incidents
involving Serb policemen against non-Serb citizens in the central
Bosnian town of Teslic in the past year, Ivanko said.
	   Disciplinary actions have been suggested against 35 police
officers. Additional crime reports were filed against 10 policemen
from the same group, he said.
	   ``I think this is the first such action of the Bosnian Serb
police,'' Ivanko said.

Indonesia to release more political prisoners
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   JAKARTA, Indonesia (AP) _ The government will continue to
release political prisoners and detainees across Indonesia,
excluding jailed East Timor rebel leader Xanana Gusmao, a senior
official said Thursday.
	   Justice Minister Muladi said those to be granted amnesty will
include aging prisoners, being released on humanitarian grounds.
	   Speaking to reporters after conferring with President B. J.
Habibie, Muladi declined to say how many prisoners would be freed,
or when.
	   But he said Gusmao, who led independence fighters in East Timor
and now is serving a 20-year term in Jakarta's Cipinang prison,
would not be released.
	   Habibie, who became president on May 21, so far has freed 73
political prisoners as part of moves to improve Indonesia's human
rights record.
	   More than 130 political prisoners remain behind bars across the
country. They were jailed under his autocratic predecessor,
Suharto, who quit as president amid a wave of protests and riots
against his regime.
	   They include pro-independence activists from three troubled
provinces in Indonesia _ the predominantly Muslim province of Aceh,
Irian Jaya in western New Guinea, and the former Portuguese colony
of East Timor.

Government says election postponed due to security reason
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   COLOMBO, Sri Lanka (AP) _ Two days after the president imposed
nationwide emergency, the government said Thursday it put off
provincial council elections because diverting security forces from
the war theater will weaken its battle against Tamil Tiger rebels.
	   ``To hold the elections we would have had to divert about 30,000
security personnel from the front, which we thought would not be
proper at this crucial stage of our efforts to end this war,''
Constitutional Affairs Minister Lakshman Peiris told a news
conference. ``We are at a decisive stage of our war against LTTE
(Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam).''
	   The Election Commission on Wednesday postponed elections in five
of the eight provinces due Aug. 28, a day after President Chandrika
Kumaratunga imposed emergency in the island.
	   Opposition parties have alleged Kumaratunga imposed the
emergency to postpone elections because her party was unlikely to
win as many votes as it has in the past.
	   Militants among Sri Lanka's 3.3 million Tamils have been
fighting for 15 years for an independent homeland in the north and
the east for the minority Tamils, who they say are discriminated by
the majority Sinhalese.
	   Peiris said his government is committed to democracy and will
hold elections by the end of the year, depending on the war.
	   Some 2,500 candidates will contest the elections, he said.
	   The provincial elections will have no bearing on parliament or
the presidency, but it is a barometer of Kumaratunga popularity.
She came to power in 1994, but there is a widespread feeling that
her popularity has eroded following rise in prices of food and her
alleged failure to solve many of the country's pressing problems.

Negotiations on fissile material production ban near
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   GENEVA (AP) _ Talks on a treaty banning the production of
material used to make nuclear weapons moved a step closer Thursday
although Israel said it may need more time to consider the idea.
	   The chairman of the 61-nation Conference on Disarmament, Mykola
Maimeskoul of Ukraine, called a meeting Friday to discuss the
proposal that a committee be set up to discuss a treaty on
so-called ``fissile materials,'' plutonium and highly enriched
uranium.
	   He said a consensus on setting up the committee is ``quite
close.''
	   But Israeli Ambassador Yosef Lamdan told the forum there was
``no guarantee that this delegation will receive its instructions''
by Friday, although he expected them rather ``sooner than later.''
	   Under international pressure following their test explosions
earlier this year, Pakistan and India have both said they are ready
to engage in negotiations. Israel is considered an undeclared
nuclear power.
	   Talks are likely to progress slowly, with countries at the
conference divided on whether they should aim to ban future
production of nuclear-weapons material or also address existing
stockpiles.
	   Pakistan said last week it wants negotiations to deal with
India's stocks.
	   Action on fissile material is referred to by arms negotiators as
the ``cut off'' treaty because it would stop the production of
nuclear weapons.
	   The Geneva conference is the world's main multilateral
disarmament body. Past successes include treaties to ban chemical
weapons and to halt test explosions of nuclear bombs.

Myanmar exiles allege schools closed, opponents jailed
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) _ An exile group of Myanmar students
claimed Thursday that the country's military regime is cracking
down on opponents ahead of the sensitive anniversary of nationwide
anti-government protests 10 years ago.
	   The All-Burma Students Democratic Front reported that schools
had been closed in the southern city of Mergui after 100 high
school students marched peacefully through the streets Tuesday to
mark the looming anniversary. No arrests were reported, though the
student leaders were reportedly put under surveillance.
	   The ABSDF, which has good contacts inside the tightly controlled
country, also claimed 11 members of pro-democracy leader Aung San
Suu Kyi's National League for Democracy have been detained since
Sunday in Chauk Township, central Myanmar.
	   NLD papers, literature and materials including tapes of Suu
Kyi's speeches were reportedly seized in raids at their homes.
	   A government official, speaking on condition of anonymity,
denied the claims, describing them in a faxed statement as ``the
usual ABSDF fabrications and wishful thinking.''
	   The official said the Mergui protest was an attempt by about 40
non-students to whip up unrest, but they were ignored by students.
In Chauk, an NLD member was questioned in connection with
distributing papers, but no one was detained, the official added.
	   The ABSDF, which the ruling generals consider a terrorist
organization, is composed of students who fled the country, also
known as Burma, in 1988 and took up arms after soldiers killed
thousands of people to quell protests against military rule.
	   The protests had built over several months in the capital,
Yangon, but spread nationwide to other cities on Aug. 8, 1988. The
date, 8-8-88, has become an emblem of the pro-democracy movement in
a country where many people take numerology seriously.
	   The anniversary comes two weeks before a deadline set by Suu
Kyi, winner of the 1991 Nobel Peace Prize, for the ruling State
Peace and Development Council to convene the parliament elected in
1990 but never allowed by the military to meet.
	   The elections were overwhelmingly won by Suu Kyi's National
League for Democracy. The military, which has ruled Myanmar since
1962, was surprised by the electoral defeat.
	   In the protest at Mergui, the ABSDF said, about 100 students
from three high schools marched and shouted pro-democracy slogans
and distributed leaflets. Police were deployed at other high
schools to prevent more students joining.
	   Col. Tin Latt, the deputy regional military commander, ordered
troops to reinforce the police and break up the protest, the ABSDF
said, but by then the three-hour demonstration had already
finished.
	   The ABSDF claimed that the military has recently formed special
anti-riot units throughout the country and that they have set up
headquarters at district police offices.
	   Suu Kyi, whose activities are strictly curtailed, brought
international criticism down on the country's rulers last week by
staging a six-day standoff against authorities in her car on a road
outside the capital.
	   She has vowed to continue to press demands that the generals
open a political dialogue with her.
	   Official newspapers Thursday carried reports of a speech by
Industry Minister Aung Thaung telling workers to be vigilant
against ``destructive elements,'' referring to Suu Kyi and her
backers.

Moody's doesn't expect Holocaust issues to impact Swiss banks
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ Moody's Investors Service said Thursday that it
doesn't expect a controversy over Holocaust-era assets to have an
impact on the credit ratings of the two major Swiss commercial
banks, UBS AG and Credit Suisse Group.
	   Holocaust survivors are taking legal action against Credit
Suisse and UBS, the product of June's merger of Union Bank of
Switzerland and Swiss Bank Corp., over assets they say were looted
or otherwise kept from them after World War II.
	   Jewish leaders angrily rejected a final offer by the two banks
on June 19 of dlrs 600 million to settle the claims, saying the
real value of the dormant wartime assets deposited by victims was
more than dlrs 1 billion. The banks said last month they will
resume talks aimed at finding an agreement but no date has been
set.
	   Assessing the financial impact of the Holocaust controversy on
Credit Suisse and UBS, Moody's said future developments ``could,
but most likely will not, affect the banks' credit outlook ... no
rating actions are likely for the time being.''
	   An independent commission headed by former Federal Reserve head
Paul Volcker, which will determine the amount of dormant accounts
that the banks will have to pay, is expected to substantially
complete its work by the end of the year.
	   Moody's said the total costs of any settlement are difficult to
estimate, although they are expected to be ``manageable.''
	   Both banks could suffer ``a degree of damage to their
reputations and business franchises if no accepted settlement is
reached,'' it said. But ``the likelihood of the two banks
ultimately suffering substantial franchise damage is low,'' it
noted.
	   The threat of boycotts against the two banks by city and state
governments in the United States is adding a further element of
uncertainty.
	   But Moody's said: ``The direct financial costs associated with
such potential sanctions are unlikely to be severe relative to the
banks' earnings strengths and ample capital positions.''
	   Moody's noted the relatively higher rating vulnerability of UBS
AG, rated triple-A for long-term deposits and single-A for
financial strength, with a negatively cautious outlook.
	   The Credit Suisse Group is rated single-A-one.
	   Moody's rates companies according to their ability to repay
their debts, assigning grades from triple-A for the strongest firms
to ``C'' for the riskiest ventures. It said it will continue to
assess the Swiss banks.

Head of big Hungarian bank resigns
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BUDAPEST, Hungary (AP) _ The chief executive and top management
of Hungary's fourth biggest bank resigned Thursday, a week after
the government suspended them for huge losses.
	   The resignations, announced by state radio, came a day before
Postabank's general assembly planned to meet and fire Gabor Princz
and the bank's other officials. The government controls 75 percent
of the bank.
	   Princz, 42, and the rest of the bank's managers were suspended
July 31 along with the bank's other officials and its board of
directors, appointing a commissioner to oversee operations.
	   ``This decision is in line with my earlier statement that if the
government doesn't support my work, I would leave the bank,''
Princz said in a letter published Thursday in the daily Kurir.
	   The reasons for the suspensions were not spelled out. But
finance ministry officials have spoken of a large amount of bad
loans and said Postabank was involved in an unsound real estate
transaction in Spain.
	   Gyula Gansperger, head of the State Holding Corp., said at least
30-40 billion forints (dlrs 14-19 million) would be required to
save the bank.

Albanians assail latest violence in Kosovo

 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with EU approving dlrs 5.5 million in aid for Kosovo.
Trims. No pickup &QL;

 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   PRISTINA, Yugoslavia (AP) _ Citing the latest wave of Serb
violence, the leader of Kosovo's Albanians and officials in
neighboring Albania have issued fresh calls for outside
intervention in the battered province.
	   The pleas Wednesday came as international sentiments remained
split over a possible military operation to try to halt the
conflict, which U.S. envoy Richard Holbrooke said has entered an
``extraordinarily dangerous new phase.''
	   Serb sources said there was continued fighting Thursday near the
village of Crnoljevo and sporadic clashes near Junik, close to the
Albanian border. The ethnic Albanians also claimed Serb forces
shelled villages in the Drenica region, including Likovac, where
U.S. envoy Christopher Hill met with Kosovo Liberation Army
fighters last week.
	   Holbrooke told CNN late Wednesday that the possibility of
intervention is increasing dramatically as the Serbs press ahead
with their offensive _ despite promising last month to halt
military operations against Kosovo's Albanians.
	   The KLA is fighting for independence for Kosovo, a province in
southern Serbia where ethnic Albanians represent 90 percent of the
population. Serbia and the smaller republic of Montenegro make up
the remainder of Yugoslavia.
	   ``It's time to use all measures for stopping the repression
against thousands of innocent people who are staying in the
mountains, hungry and defenseless,'' Albania's Foreign Ministry
said late Wednesday.
	   Serb authorities, whose forces are still sweeping through
villages in a powerful offensive, acknowledged that they had killed
dozens of ethnic Albanians in one grisly recent battle and then
buried the unclaimed bodies. They angrily called media reports
about mass graves a lie, however, and said all the dead were
``terrorists.''
	   European Union monitors who visited the site at Orahovac, 30
miles (50 kilometers) southwest of Kosovo's capital, Pristina, said
Wednesday they found no evidence of mass graves.
	   But a furor continued over recent attacks that have emptied
whole villages and killed civilians as well as KLA fighters.
	   ``Serb forces attack and kill unprotected people, systematically
destroy and burn property of Albanians, which leads to the
displacement of tens of thousands of Albanians,'' ethnic Albanian
leader Ibrahim Rugova said.
	   Bujar Bukoshi, prime minister of the Kosovo Albanians'
government-in-exile, appealed on Albanian television Wednesday for
world leaders and humanitarian groups to ``take all emergency
measures to halt the genocide.''
	   While aid agencies were continuing efforts to provide help to
the refugees, no military intervention appeared likely soon.
	   Despite NATO's longstanding threat to step in, officials at NATO
headquarters said this week that no military action was planned at
this stage.
	   Even Washington appeared to ease its position on intervention,
according to German opposition candidate Gerhard Schroeder, who met
with President Bill Clinton on Wednesday.
	   ``We agreed that an intervention _ if that were to happen at all
_ can and should only happen under the umbrella of the United
Nations Security Council,'' Schroeder said.
	   That would be a change of position for the United States.
Defense Secretary William Cohen has said NATO doesn't need
permission from the United Nations if it decides to use force in
Kosovo.
	   Holbrooke, the U.S. envoy, told BBC World Service television
Wednesday: ``The situation has entered an extraordinarily dangerous
new phase. ... We are in the middle of a massive military
offensive.''
	   Also Thursday, the European Union approved 5 million European
currency units (dlrs 5.5 million) in aid for Kosovo. The EU
Commission said the funds will enable the United Nations and
humanitarian groups to take urgent steps to help people fleeing the
fighting.

<TEXT>
	   DHAKA, Bangladesh (AP) _ A visiting U.S. military mission is
assessing how to help Bangladesh cope with floods like those that
have killed at least 350 people, a spokesman said Thursday.
	   The mission is part of a five-year U.S. program to help plan
relief for victims of the floods and cyclones that frequently
devastate this delta nation, said Lt. Col. Frank Rindone, the U.S.
defense attache in Dhaka.
	   ``We want to provide the assistance Bangladesh needs,'' he said.
	   The 10-person mission comprising engineers, doctors and disaster
management experts arrived earlier this month. During its
three-week tour, the team is identifying areas needing the most
help and will submit a program to both governments, Ridone said.
	   Bangladesh has objected to allowing U.S. troops to enter
Bangladesh without passports and visas. Opposition leaders have
said such an agreement would be tantamount to establishing an
American military base in Bangladesh, an allegation the U.S.
embassy has denied.
	   The Humanitarian Assistance Needs Assessment (HANA) programs,
sponsored by the U.S. Defense Department, exists in nearly 100
countries.
	   American soldiers returning home from their Gulf War duty in
1991 detoured to the Bangladesh coast to help survivors of a deadly
cyclone that claimed 138,000 lives.
	   Floods that began to hit the country more than three weeks ago
submerged vast areas in nearly half of Bangladesh's districts and
displaced or damaged the property of 17 million people. Nearly
50,000 people are suffering from water-borne diseases.

Tribal chiefs want better treatment under Indonesia's new
</HEADLINE>
government &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   JAKARTA, Indonesia (AP) _ Tribal chieftains from Indonesia's
remotest corners urged the country's new government Thursday not to
trample on the rights of their people, who have been sidelined
under 32 years of authoritarian rule.
	   At a U.N.-sponsored conference on tribal Indonesians, leaders
from the islands of Sumba, Nias, Borneo, Sulawesi and New Guinea
joined anthropologists to complain that they have been marginalized
under development programs pursued by former President Suharto.
	   Some also have suffered from an influx of tourism and have been
badly affected by rising inflation and mass unemployment from the
worst economic crisis in 30 years.
	   Suharto stepped down in May after a wave of riots and protests
swept the world's fourth most populous country.
	   His successor, President B.J. Habibie, has promised more
democracy and big economic reforms.
	   ``We hope the Habibie government will be a better moral force
for improving the lives of tribal Indonesians,'' said Umbu Ndena
Billi, a chief from Sumba Island, about 2,000 kilometers (1,200
miles) southeast of Jakarta.
	   About 1.3 million of Indonesia's 202 million people are
considered by anthropologists to be following traditional tribal
ways of life.
	   The conference was told that many have been forced off their
land and pushed away from their cultures by economic development.
	   ``Lands have been taken for palm-oil companies, mining companies
and forestry concessions,'' said Stephanus Djuweng, an
anthropologist who has worked with the Dayak people of Borneo.
	   Several tribal leaders said their people had been forced to sell
land earmarked for development.
	   In some cases, they claimed they had also been bullied by the
Indonesian military to comply with government orders from the
capital, Jakarta.
	   A major source of friction has been a longstanding program known
as ``transmigration,'' under which thousands of people from the
overpopulated main island of Java have been resettled on
underdeveloped outer islands.
	   Tribal communities and the newcomers, who have established farms
and plantations on formerly traditional land, sometimes fight.
	   ``The Javanese have a very different concept of land ownership
to tribal Indonesians,'' said Professor Boedihartono of the
University of Indonesia.
	   Historian Ong Hok Kam said Suharto's government, which came to
power in 1966, had blatantly sucked wealth and resources from
outlying islands to build wealth in Java.
	   This had generated widespread resentment in far flung regions
against the government in Jakarta.
	   Suharto's government had argued that ``isolated tribes'' must be
brought into the mainstream of national life through education and
economic development, pointing out that they often fell beneath the
official poverty line.

 &UR; Latest confrontation with Iraq produces calmer Western reaction &QL; 
 &UR; By EILEEN ALT POWELL &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   CAIRO, Egypt (AP) _ Last November, when Iraq expelled American
weapons inspectors on U.N. teams from Baghdad, the United States
responded swiftly by sending aircraft carriers and building up its
forces in the Gulf.
	   In the latest dispute, triggered by Iraqi leader Saddam
Hussein's announcement Wednesday that he would ``completely suspend
cooperation'' with U.N. weapons teams, the reaction from Washington
has been restrained.
	   ``At the end of the day, we will judge the situation on Iraqi
actions, not Iraqi words,'' said White House spokesman P.J.
Crowley.
	   Analysts in the Middle East believe that Saddam is betting it
will be harder for the United States to respond firmly to his
defiance of the United Nations this time.
	   Arab governments _ mindful of the deep public sympathy over the
plight of Iraq's 20 million people after eight years of U.N. trade
sanctions _ are as loath now as they were last winter to support
military strikes against Iraq.
	   And the near demise of the Middle East peace process, which most
Arabs blame on America's failure to pressure Israel, has not built
confidence that the United States is being even-handed in the
region.
	   Experts also cite President Clinton's deepening legal troubles
over allegations he had a sexual relationship with former White
House intern Monica Lewinsky and lied about it.
	   ``The president has to testify on Aug. 17, so he doesn't have
much time to deal with a crisis in Iraq,'' Abdel-Moneim Said Aly,
head of Cairo's Al-Ahram Center for Political and Strategic
Studies, told The Associated Press.
	   He added: ``That would suggest there's some interest in
postponing any confrontation for at least a couple of weeks.''
	   Washington could become more outspoken if the situation heats
up. But it did not get much support for threatened use of force in
last winter's crisis.
	   Among Arabs, even staunch ally Saudi Arabia refused to have its
territory used for an attack on Iraq. Of the U.N. Security
Council's five permanent members, only Britain joined in issuing
military threats against Baghdad.
	   The three other permanent members _ France, Russia and China _
reacted coolly to the idea and have since sought to ease sanctions
against Iraq.
	   The last crises ended on Feb. 23, when U.N. Secretary-General
Kofi Annan negotiated a deal in Baghdad in which Iraq promised to
cooperate with U.N. weapons teams and to open Saddam's palaces _ at
the center of the dispute _ to inspection.
	   Newspapers across the Arab world on Thursday again expressed
support for a political rather than military solution.
	   The English-language Egyptian Gazette, in an editorial titled
``Mere hiccup or brinkmanship?'' _ urged compromise to avoid a
showdown ``fueled by Washington's trigger happiness ... and the
growing pessimism inside Iraq over the prolonged crippling
sanctions.''
	   Saddam's goal, announced in a speech last month, is to have the
U.N. sanctions lifted before year's end.
	   The sanctions, imposed eight years ago Thursday to punish Iraq
for its 1990 invasion of Kuwait, ban the sale of oil, the country's
economic mainstay.
	   U.N. resolutions that ended the 1991 Gulf War say the sanctions
will not be lifted until U.N. inspectors certify that Baghdad has
eliminated its nuclear, chemical and biological weapons as well as
long-range missiles.
	   The Iraqi leader announced the freeze in cooperation with U.N.
weapons teams after the chief inspector, Richard Butler, on Monday
refused to give Iraq a clean bill of health on its weapons of mass
destruction.
	   The often-caustic Butler was guarded Wednesday after a meeting
with Annan, telling reporters of the need for ``creative''
solutions to the problem. He was to report to the U.N. Security
Council later Thursday.

Todor Zhivkov, Bulgaria's long-time Communist ironman, dies at 86

<TEXT>
	   SOFIA, Bulgaria (AP) _ Todor Zhivkov, Bulgaria's Communist
dictator for 35 years and eastern Europe's last surviving Stalinist
leader, has died, officials announced Thursday. He was 86.
	   He died Wednesday night, the office of Bulgaria's reformist
president, Petar Stoyanov, announced. Zhivkov had fallen into a
coma after being hospitalized July 8 with a respiratory infection,
hospital officials were quoted by the official BTA news agency as
saying. He also had suffered from diabetes and other ailments in
recent months.
	   Zhivkov held the record among his eastern European peers for
time in office _ from 1954 until his fall in the anti-communist
revolutions of 1989.
	   Stoyanov expressed his condolences Thursday to Zhivkov's family
but said in a public statement that Zhivkov oversaw ``one of the
darkest periods of recent Bulgarian history.''
	   ``Eight million Bulgarians lived during that long period with
their work, dreams and illusions, but also in fear and political
repression,'' Stoyanov said. ``With the death of Todor Zhivkov the
era of Bulgarian communism is finally ending.''
	   Zhivkov outlived his former Kremlin bosses and other Balkan
dictators: Yugoslavia's Josip Broz Tito died in 1980, and Albania's
Enver Hoxha in 1985. Romania's Nicolae Ceausescu was executed in
1989.
	   His longevity at Bulgaria's helm was largely based on such
absolute servility to Moscow that Zhivkov once proposed that
Bulgaria should merge with the Soviet Union.
	   In this, he was exceptional. Even the leaders of other Soviet
satellites in eastern Europe occasionally demonstrated varying
degrees of independence, or were slow in switching to the latest
orientation of their Soviet masters.
	   Zhivkov dealt mercilessly with dissent, imprisoning thousands of
people in the Lovech and Skravena prison camps in the 1950s and
1960s.
	   ``He served the Soviet Union more ardently than the Soviet
leaders themselves did,'' wrote Georgi Markov, a defector working
for the BBC in London. In 1978, Markov was slain _ most likely by
Bulgarian agents _ with a special umbrella that injected him with a
tiny poison vial.
	   Zhivkov was born into a poor family in Pravets, near Sofia, on
Sept. 7, 1911. Like others who rose to Communist heights after
World War II, Zhivkov came from a rural background.
	   He was part of a generation that got its first education after
World War I dissolved the Ottoman and Habsburg empires that had
ruled the Balkans for centuries. His learning led him to embrace
revolution, and Zhivkov joined Bulgaria's illegal Communist party
in 1932.
	   His meteoric rise through the party ranks started in 1944, when
the Bulgarian Communists seized power with the backing of the Red
Army. In 1954, he became first secretary of Bulgaria's staunchly
Stalinist Communist Party.
	   Bulgaria's course meshed tightly with Moscow's until the late
1980s, when Soviet dogmatism eased under Mikhail Gorbachev _ a man
Zhivkov despised until his death for what he said was Gorbachev's
betrayal of the hard-line communist cause.
	   In 1956, Zhivkov demonstrated his loyalty to Nikita Khrushchev
by siding with him in his condemnation of Josef Stalin. With the
same ease, he allied with Leonid Brezhnev and other Moscow
hard-liners when they ousted Khrushchev in 1964.
	   In 1965, Zhivkov crushed an attempt by some Bulgarian Communists
to yank the country from its increasingly tight Soviet orbit,
declaring afterward that he was ``with the Soviet Union for life or
death!''
	   Years after Zhivkov himself was ousted, he admitted that ``all
Soviet leaders made mistakes.''
	   For decades, the Bulgarian people feared ``Papa'' Zhivkov.
	   An attempt to groom his daughter Ludmila as heir ended with her
death under unclear circumstances in 1981.
	   In the mid-1980s, as the country's debt-ridden economy started
to collapse, Zhivkov tried to whip up nationalist support by
cracking down on Bulgaria's Turkish minority, making them change
their names to Bulgarian-sounding ones. About 320,000 people
eventually fled to Turkey.
	   But with the advent of Gorbachev's reforms, Zhivkov's grip on
power started to slip. Unlike Gorbachev, Zhivkov could not blame
predecessors for past mistakes.
	   Zhivkov was ousted as head of the communist party in 1989 and
replaced as president of Bulgaria.
	   He was arrested the following year on charges of
misappropriating state funds. He was sentenced in 1991 to seven
years in prison, but his failing health meant he never went to
jail. Instead, he spent his final years under house arrest.
	   In 1998, Zhivkov was suddenly reinstated as a member of the
Socialist party, which succeeded the Communists, and found himself
able to alarm rivals and inspire rousing ovations again.
	   ``Because of my age, I would prefer that people choose someone
who is younger,'' he told The Associated Press this year. ``But
they can't free themselves from thinking about me. That's the
psychology of the people.''
	   Zhivkov is survived by his son, Vladimir, who lives in Sofia.
State radio said the funeral would be held Sunday in the Bulgarian
capital.

Mexican town refuses access to Red Cross

<TEXT>
	   SAN CRISTOBAL DE LAS CASAS, Mexico (AP) _ Governing party
officials in a rural Chiapas state town have rejected an offer of
help from the International Red Cross, saying they feared human
rights groups would follow it.
	   Sabanilla Mayor Benedicto Perez Mendez told Red Cross officials
that local officials decided to bar them entry Wednesday ``to
communities where allegedly there is evidence of violation of human
rights'' _ which includes most of Sabanilla.
	   Other town leaders rose and said the Swiss-based organization
was not wanted because ``human rights people would creep in'' with
the Red Cross.
	   State and federal officials have accused some human rights
groups in the southern state of siding with the rebel Zapatista
National Liberation Army and foreigners of meddling in Mexican
affairs.
	   Some towns have barred foreign visitors and the federal
government has expelled several human rights workers from Chiapas,
accusing them of violating terms of their visas or of involvement
in politics.
	   The town 40 miles (65 kilometers) north of San Cristobal has
seen repeated clashes between pro-government and pro-rebel
factions. A pro-government vigilante group accused of several
attacks, known as Peace and Justice, is active in the area.
	   Red Cross delegate Pierre Townsend told villagers that the
organization had been invited by the Mexican government and planned
to distribute medical aid.
	   According to reporters who witnessed the exchange, Townsend said
that the International Red Cross usually works only in war
situations. ``It is a little special here in Mexico because we are
not dealing with a conflict. Yes, there are tensions but there is
not an open war.''
	   Perez Mendez said the town council ``decided there will not be
access for you. I clarify that so you will not say that some in the
community are aggressive.''
	   Red Cross workers were attacked in the Sabanilla community of El
Paraiso last month. Townsend said the local residents may not have
realized why the workers were visiting.
	   President Ernesto Zedillo visited Sabanilla in late May and
praised villagers for ``finding the path to reconciliation''
between rival groups.

French soccer on a high as new season kicks off

	   PARIS (AP) _ Boosted by the country's spectacular World Cup
success, France's soccer season kicks off Friday with top clubs
stemming the outward flow of talent that has long dogged the
domestic league.
	   In the first round of matches, Le Havre plays last year's
runner-up Metz, while Monaco travels to newly-promoted Lorient.
Seven other games will be played Saturday.
	   At the start of recent seasons, French clubs have counted the
cost of lost talent, with players quickly heading for the more
lucrative and glamorous leagues of Italy, Spain or England.
	   When France won the World Cup July 12, only eight of the 22-man
squad - and only two of the 14 who took part that night - played
for French clubs.
	   But over the summer, France's three most powerful clubs -
Marseille, Monaco and Paris Saint-Germain - have shown that they
are better able to attract, and keep, top talent.
	   Just before the World Cup, Metz midfielder Robert Pires, widely
considered as the best young player to emerge in France for several
years, resisted an offer from English champion Arsenal, moving
instead to Marseille for a then French record 60 million francs
(dlrs 10 million).
	   And since helping France to World Cup success, young Monaco
stars Thierry Henry and David Trezeguet have turned down offers
from abroad.
	   Since the World Cup victory, only one French World Cup player -
third-choice goalkeeper Lionel Charbonnier of Auxerre - has quit
the French league.
	   One other, second-choice goalkeeper Bernard Lama, has moved the
other direction, rejoining PSG from England's West Ham.
	   Top French clubs are also doing more to make the French league a
home for top foreign players.
	   Italians Marco Simone and Fabrizio Ravanelli, the league's two
biggest foreign stars, were widely expected to leave France over
the summer, but have decided to stay at PSG and Marseille
respectively.
	   During the summer break PSG beat a clutch of top European clubs
to sign Nigerian star Jay-Jay Okocha for a French record 100
million francs (17 million dlrs) and German international defender
Christian Woerns, who was out of contract at Bayer Leverkusen.
	   ``I convinced Okocha of the ambitions of the club, of its new
generation of players, and the quality of the Paris public. In
doing that, the World Cup helped me,'' said Charles Bietry, PSG
president.
	   Still, less wealthy clubs have found it harder to keep their top
players.
	   Unable to pay top wages, last year's championship winner Lens
and runner-up Metz lost a clutch of key players.
	   Jean-Guy Wallemme, Stephane Ziani and Anto Drobnjak left Lens
for foreign fields and only injury prevented Marc-Vivien Foe from
leaving Lens for the English league.
	   Metz lost Jocelyn Blanchard and Rigobert Song to Italian clubs.
	   But by persuading former Metz star Pires to stay in France,
Marseille bucked the trend.
	   An eight-time champion of France, Marseille bought big this
summer.
	   Boosted by a French-record 34,000 season ticket holders - nearly
double last season's figure - and continued private investment from
Adidas president Robert Louis-Dreyfus, the club forked out more
than 130 million francs (dlrs 22 million) to bring Pires, PSG's
Florian Maurice, Nantes' Jocelyn Gourvennec and Lyon's Daniel Bravo
to the Stade Velodrome.
	   Marseille's longtime rival PSG witnessed a summer revolution.
	   Though PSG won both domestic cups last season, seventh place in
the championship standings was considered a disaster for France's
richest club.
	   Alain Giresse took over from Ricardo as manager, and the club's
owner and main financial backer, Cable TV station Canal +,
appointed Bietry as president to replace Michel Denisot.
	   In addition to internationals Okocha, Woerns and Lama, PSG also
spent heavily on Brazilian striker Adailton from Italy's Parma,
Nantes midfielder Bruno Carotti and Auxerre defender Alain Goma.
	   The third heavily-tipped challenger for the championship, 1997
winner Monaco, was less active over the summer, but was delighted
that coach Jean Tigana - tipped as a possible successor to Aime
Jacquet as boss of the national team - stayed at the club.
	   Though Monaco sold key midfielders John Collins and Ali
Benarbia, it is strengthened by the arrival of French
internationals Sabri Lamouchi and Franck Gava.
	   Even though they don't have the pulling power of Marseille, PSG
and Monaco, other clubs say that they are benefiting from the
country's World Cup success.
	   Almost all report higher season ticket numbers.

Oldest-known sentence in Dutch was from a love letter
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   AMSTERDAM, Netherlands (AP) _ So what's a nice wench like you
doing around a monastery like this?
	   Scholars claim to have found the oldest-known complete sentence
written in the Dutch language, and the phrase _ scribbled by a
medieval monk sometime around 1100 _ sounds more like a pickup line
than a religious text.
	   The sentence, contained in a tattered notebook to go on display
Aug. 19 at Amsterdam's New Church, is archaically phrased and bears
little resemblance to modern-day Dutch.
	   The Flemish flirtation reads like this: ``All the birds have
begun building their nests. Except you and me _ what are we waiting
for?''
	   Amsterdam's thriving gay community has co-opted the line under
the assumption that the writer was romancing a fellow monk, Het
Financieele Dagblad reported Thursday.
	   But other scholars, noting that celibacy for clerics was not
strictly enforced in the Middle Ages, contend the monk may well
have been romancing a woman, the newspaper said.

Chinese dissidents plan march to call for comrades' release
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BEIJING (AP) _ Nearly 100 democracy campaigners will risk arrest
by marching through two Chinese cities next Wednesday to demand the
release of detained activists, a Hong Kong-based rights group said.
	   Activists in coastal Hangzhou and central Changsha cities have
applied for parade permits from police, the Information Center of
Human Rights and Democratic Movement in China said Thursday.
	   But more than 90 people have pledged to join in the two marches
even if permission is refused, said Lu Siqing, the center's founder
and spokesman.
	   Chinese police routinely turn down applications for protest
marches, and the penalty for parading illegally can be heavy.
	   Dissidents are demanding the release of Zhang Shanguang, a labor
rights advocate detained July 22, and of Wang Youcai and Lin Hui,
arrested last month after organizing an opposition party.
	   Wang, detained July 10, will be indicted within a week according
to Chinese legal procedure, Lu said.
	   Indictments almost always bring convictions in Chinese courts.
If Wang is found guilty of subversion, police will likely punish
others associated with the founding of the China Democracy Party,
said Lu. At least a dozen people linked to the party have already
been detained and released.
	   ``The situation is extremely dire. If Wang is indicted, it could
cause a chain reaction affecting everyone involved,'' Lu said.
	   Wary of any challenge to the Communist Party's monopoly on
political power, authorities in Hangzhou have refused to register
the China Democracy Party, even though the law says they must.
	   The three in custody were detained as part of the most concerted
police crackdown on dissent in years. It came on the heels of U.S.
President Bill Clinton's breakthrough visit to China.

Government says it lacks authority to remove crosses from Auschwitz

 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   WARSAW, Poland (AP) _ The Polish government on Thursday said it
does not have the authority to remove dozens of crosses recently
erected just outside the walls of the infamous Nazi death camp at
Auschwitz.
	   Israel asked the government Wednesday to remove more than 50
crosses placed near the camp in recent weeks by Roman Catholic
faithful at the urging of a conservative Catholic radio station.
	   The government, however, said it lacked authority to order the
removal of the crosses. It said in a statement that the crosses
were on private property, and that the Roman Catholic Church, not
the state, was responsible for religious symbols in Poland.
	   Dozens of crosses have been erected over the last two weeks as a
sign of protest against efforts to remove a much larger,
eight-meter (26-foot) cross that has stood just meters from the
camp's wall since 1988.
	   The large cross was used during a 1979 papal mass and was later
placed on the grounds of a fomer Carmelite nunnery on Auschwitz's
periphery to commemorate the event and to honor the memory of Poles
executed at the site by the Nazis.
	   Jewish groups around the world have long protested the presence
of the cross so close to the Nazi death camp, saying it harms the
memory of the Holocaust's Jewish victims.
	   The government had sought to mediate a solution to the dispute
earlier this year when the nuns handed the property over to the
state. However, since then a veteran's group has claimed legal
rights to the property based on a 35-year-old rental agreement.
	   The church, meanwhile, defended the placement of additional
crosses at the site.
	   ``This is Polish soil and all imposition of other will is seen
as interference into sovereignty,'' said Jozef Glemp, the head of
Poland's Catholic church, Cardinal Jozef Glemp. Individuals erected
smaller crosses ``not out of fantasy but because of the constant
nagging by the Jewish side for a swift removal of the cross.''
	   The government said it viewed the ``aggravating conflict'' over
Auschwitz memorial with ``anxiety,'' and that it would spare no
effort to prevent the issue from hurting Polish-Israeli relations.
	   But the government said the best way to ease the controversy was
for mutual respect.
	   ``We are aware of the role that the cross has for the Poles and
we are aware of the Auschwitz-Birkenau camp's meaning to the Jews
around the world,'' the statement said.
	   From 1940-45, some 1.5 million people, mostly Jews, were killed
in the camp's gas chambers, executed or died of starvation, disease
and forced labor.

Zimbabwe sends military training team to Congo
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   HARARE, Zimbabwe (AP) _ A team of 10 senior Zimbabwe army
officers is in Congo providing training and advice to Congo's
President Laurent Kabila, a newspaper reported Thursday.
	   Defense Minister Moven Mahachi denied that Zimbabwe had sent
combat troops to help Kabila stem an advancing rebel offensive from
the east, the Zimbabwe Financial Gazette reported.
	   The newspaper quoted Mahachi as saying he could confirm that
Congo ``has sought some military assistance from us, but only in
the restructuring and training of its army.''
	   The Zimbabwean officers went to Congo, as the former Zaire is
known, last month to assess the possibility of military assistance
from Zimbabwe.
	   ``It is unfortunate the internal conflict in the (Congo) has
come at a time when we are in the midst of finalizing'' an
agreement, Mahachi was quoted as saying.
	   Zimbabwe will host a regional summit later this week to discuss
the crisis in the Congo.
	   So far, leaders of the Congo, Namibia, Zambia, Rwanda and Uganda
have confirmed their attendance. Zimbabwe officials have issued
conflicting dates for both Friday and Saturday at or near Victoria
Falls.
	   A South African foreign affairs spokesman said Wednesday he knew
of no invitation to attend the summit.
	   President Robert Mugabe, who will host the summit, is the
chairman of the Southern Africa Development Community's committee
on politics, defense and security.

<TEXT>
	   SOFIA, Bulgaria (AP) _ Todor Zhivkov, Bulgaria's Communist
dictator for 35 years and eastern Europe's last surviving Stalinist
leader, has died, officials announced Thursday. He was 86.
	   He died Wednesday night, the office of Bulgaria's reformist
president, Petar Stoyanov, announced. Zhivkov had fallen into a
coma after being hospitalized July 8 with a respiratory infection,
hospital officials were quoted by the official BTA news agency as
saying. He also had suffered from diabetes and other ailments in
recent months.
	   Zhivkov held the record among his eastern European peers for
time in office _ from 1954 until his fall in the anti-communist
revolutions of 1989.
	   Stoyanov expressed his condolences Thursday to Zhivkov's family
but said in a public statement that Zhivkov oversaw ``one of the
darkest periods of recent Bulgarian history.''
	   ``Eight million Bulgarians lived during that long period with
their work, dreams and illusions, but also in fear and political
repression,'' Stoyanov said. ``With the death of Todor Zhivkov the
era of Bulgarian communism is finally ending.''
	   But Zhivkov's dominant presence had long faded. Radio and
television reported his death briefly, but public fear and anger
toward the ex-dictator had turned largely to apathy, with many
younger Bulgarians now unaware of his impact.
	   Dimitar Georgiev, a 46-year-old technician in Sofia, said he
approved of Bulgaria's rulers having ``let the old man die in
peace.''
	   ``After all,'' he said, ``Zhivkov was part of history, for good
or bad.''

Malaysian state government cancels Hindu procession
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia (AP) _ Authorities in northern Malaysia
have canceled a Hindu ceremony, fearing it could trigger
Hindu-Muslim violence, the national news agency Bernama reported
Thursday.
	   Friday's annual fire-walking ritual at a temple in Gelugor in
Penang state was put off at the directive of officials after some
pamphlets inciting ``religious hatred and racial disunity'' were
distributed, the agency said.
	   The public should cooperate with police so that ``stern and
effective measures'' could be taken against the distributors of the
pamphlets, Penang Chief Minister Koh Tsu Koon said Thursday.
	   State Police Chief Abdul Hamid Mustapha said the pamphlets, one
written for Hindus and the other for Muslims, were found in several
places in the state. Contents of the pamphlets were not disclosed.
	   He said that until Wednesday morning, the ceremony had been
expected to be held as planned, but police advised against it after
an assessment of the security situation.
	   Local authorities and police held discussions with both Hindu
and Muslim leaders to defuse tensions, Bernama said.
	   In March, thousands of Muslims marched toward a Hindu temple in
Penang, swinging wooden planks and hurling stones. The Muslims were
rankled by Hindu rites at the temple, saying too much bell-ringing
disrupted Muslim prayers. The Hindu temple has since been moved to
another site.
	   Penang's multi-ethnic community of 1 million people comprises
Buddhists, Muslims, Hindus and Christians. Hindus, mostly migrants
from southern India, account for about 10 percent of Malaysia's 22
million people.

Thai health ministry blames foreign workers for malaria
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) _ The Ministry of Health said Thursday
that illegal foreign workers from neighboring Myanmar are spreading
the deadly disease malaria in Thailand.
	   The ministry said 78,000 people contracted malaria between
October and June, compared with about 73,000 in the same period the
previous year. Hundreds have died from the disease, ministry
officials said, although they have not yet tallied the exact
figure.
	   They said that between 700 and 800 people die each year in
Thailand from malaria.
	   The area along the Thai-Myanmar border is home to some of the
world's most resistant strains of the mosquito-borne disease.
	   Thailand has about 300,000 illegal migrants from Myanmar who
have fled either abuses by the military government or the desperate
poverty of that undeveloped nation.
	   More than 50 percent of the patients were Thais, but a ministry
official said illegal workers from Myanmar are leading carriers of
the disease.
	   He said, however, that it would be useless to try to round them
up and send them back to Myanmar, as they would just sneak into
Thailand again.
	   Also, if they fear Thai officials, they are less likely to be
examined by any Thai doctors who might identify them as carriers of
the disease and treat them.
	   ``The situation is under control,'' said the official, who spoke
on condition of anonymity. He insisted areas frequented by large
numbers of tourists were not malaria hot spots.
	   Malaria has spread widely in Thailand's 46 provinces where the
government has allowed alien workers to seek jobs, said Dr. Yuth
Potharamith, director-general the Department of Communicable
Disease Control.
	   A meeting is scheduled in two weeks for health officials of
Thailand and Myanmar to exchange information to control the spread
of the disease across the border.

Two Somali factions agree to stop fighting

 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with Ethiopia reportedly invading Somalia for third
time, beginning 5th graf pvs. &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   MOGADISHU, Somalia (AP) _ Two Somalia factions agreed in 20 days
of negotiations to a deal to bring peace to their country's border
region with Ethiopia.
	   Their pact was a small step towards fostering peace throughout
Somalia, which has been at war since 1991 when rival clans turned
on each other after driving dictator Mohamed Siad Barre from power.
	   The Somalia National Front and Al-Itihad Al-Islam, or Islamic
Unity, agreed to a six-point plan to stop fighting for control of
the western Gedo region, representatives of the two sides told
journalists in a radio call to Mogadishu on Wednesday.
	   The pact also calls for the two sides to work together to remove
land mines from roads so trade can resume. They agreed to adopt the
Somali National Front's political emblem for the region and to
impose Islam laws.
	   They also agreed to seek peace with Ethiopia, whose troops
reportedly invaded the Somali border town of Bulo Hawo early
Thursday.
	   Al-Itihad Al-Islam has fought since 1992 for the unification of
the southeastern Ethiopian Ogaden region with Somalia. Ogaden is
populated by ethnic Somalis.
	   The Muslim group claimed responsibility for bomb attacks and
abductions in Ethiopia. In retaliation, Ethiopian forces have
crossed into Somalia's Gedo region pursuing Al-Itihad Al-Islam
fighters.
	   In the third invasion in two years, about 300 Ethiopian troops
in tanks and armored vehicles took control of Bulo Hawo on
Thursday, radio operators said.
	   Citing security concerns, they refused to discuss the fighting
or casualties.

Judgement date set for Aug. 20, defendants claim torture
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   NYERI, Kenya (AP) - Tow men charged with killing a British
tourist on the grounds of a posh hotel told the court Thursday
police beat them badly when they refused to confess.
	   Peter Hiuhu Gachau and Simon Njoroge Wairimu, who are acting in
their own defense, are charged with the Feb. 5 stabbing death of
Roy Chivers on the grounds of Aberdare Country Club, 130 kilometers
(80 miles) north of Nairobi.
	   Gachau said he was beaten by police at four difference police
stations but refused to sign a confession because he knew nothing
about the killing.
	   At an earlier hearing, Magistrate Julius S. Mushelle ruled that
a signed confession by Gachau was admissible as evidence.
	   Mushelle adjourned the trial until Aug. 20 when he said he will
issue a verdict.
	   Chivers, 50, of Orpington, Kent, was stabbed in the chest while
strolling on the grounds of the the country club with his wife,
Sandra Christine. He died while being flown to a Nairobi hospital.
	   The defendants are also charged with robbing the Chivers of two
cameras and a pair of binoculars.
	   Since the trial began May 7, contradictions have arisen between
testimonies by prosecution witnesses and the defendants.
	   On July 17, police testified that blood samples taken from the
clothing of one of the suspects did not match the victim's blood
type.
	   Mrs. Chivers was unable to identify the accused in a police
lineup on May 6, saying the incident had happened quickly and she
had been in a state of shock.
	   If found guilty, the defendants face mandatory death sentences.
	   Earlier last month, the two defendants were convicted and
sentenced to death in a separate trial in the same court for the
robbery and murder of a Kenyan farmer.

New regulation limits religious workers to 3-month visas
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By NICK WADHAMS &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Foreign religious workers will only be allowed to
stay in Russia for three months at a time under a new government
regulation, religious groups said Thursday.
	   Russia came under international criticism last year for a law
that places limits on foreign religious groups, and the latest
regulation could also complicate the work of missionaries and
churches that come from abroad.
	   Under the new rule, foreign religious workers must leave Russia
every three months to get their visas renewed at a Russian embassy
or consulate abroad.
	   Most foreigners in Russia, including religious workers, have
been able to get their Russian visas renewed for a year without
leaving the country.
	   ``It will considerably complicate some things,'' said Donald
Jarvis, head of the Mormon Church's Ekaterinburg mission, located
in central Russia. ``It will make it all much more expensive.''
	   Jarvis runs a mission that includes over 100 missionaries, most
from the United States. He said they may have to travel to Mongolia
or some other country every three months to renew their visas.
	   At least one government official said the edict was an outgrowth
of last year's law on religion that enshrines the Russian Orthodox
Church as the country's predominant religion and curtails the
rights of many other churches.
	   ``This step has been indirectly inspired by the new law,'' said
Mikhail Osadchev, an aide to Valery Borschchov, deputy head of the
Russian parliament's Committee on Public and Religious
Organizations.
	   Osadchev called the directive ``another move against religious
rights and freedoms and another unfriendly act in relation to
foreign religious organizations.''
	   The Russian Orthodox Church has been highly critical of
so-called foreign religions coming to Russia and seeking converts.
It was one of the major forces behind last year's religion bill.
	   The new rule could bring renewed foreign criticism of Russia.
	   The U.S. Senate Foreign Relations Committee last year called for
cutting American aid to Russia if religious restrictions were
implemented.
	   However, the Russian government has not strictly enforced last
year's law and foreign religions organizations say, with few
exceptions, they have been able to operate as before.
	   The foreign religious groups, including many Christian
denominations from the United States, began arriving in Russia
after the 1991 Soviet breakup and the end of many restrictions that
had been in place during the communist era.

Torrential rain hits South Korea; 82 killed

<TEXT>
	   SEOUL, South Korea (AP) _ Torrential rains triggered floods and
landslides in Seoul and surrounding provinces Thursday, killing at
least 82 people, leaving 40 missing and submerging thousands of
homes.
	   Disaster relief headquarters urged 200,000 people in low-lying
districts in and near the capital to evacuate as tributaries of the
Han River, which bisects the city, threatened to overflow.
	   Suburbs north and west of Seoul were submerged in waist-deep
water. Rescuers used rubber boats to help move citizens to higher
ground. Uijongbu, a satellite city north of Seoul, was completely
cut off, with roads swept away, a subway line flooded and telephone
poles downed.
	   In a riverside resort town north of Seoul, relief workers
recovered seven bodies from mudslides that covered bungalows and
shops. They were searching for a dozen more believed missing and
feared dead.
	   Four people were killed when a restaurant in an amusement park
in northern Seoul collapsed under a mudslide. The Defense Ministry
said at least 10 soldiers were killed by a landslide while working
to restore damaged communications lines.
	   Four people were killed when a flash flood slammed into their
homes in a valley near Uijongbu. A 49-year-old woman was
electrocuted in a nearby city.
	   Firefighter Chan Mu-won, 28, was swept away after he waded into
swirling floodwaters and helped two people to safety. His body was
found six hours later.
	   Thursday's deaths brought to 218 the number of dead or missing
from heavy rains that have lashed South Korea since last weekend.
Flash floods raced down streams and ravines in a national park in
the southern part of the nation over the weekend, leaving 65 people
dead and 31 missing.
	   ``Most of today's victims either drowned or were buried in
landslides. The figures will rise when floods subside and we look
more closely at the debris,'' said Chang Yong-min, a relief worker.
	   U.S. soldiers near the border with communist North Korea were
trying to recover several shipping containers of small arms
ammunition swept away by rains, said Jim Coles, spokesman of the
U.S. military command.
	   An unknown number of land mines were uprooted and swept away
along a portion of the demilitarized zone separating South and
North Korea. The region was declared off limits. As many as a
million mines are believed strewn along the DMZ as a military
deterrent.
	   Up to 61 centimeters (24 inches) of rain poured down in Seoul
and its suburbs between late Wednesday and Thursday morning,
submerging 5,800 homes and other buildings and leaving at least
3,000 people homeless.
	   With weather forecasters predicting more rain, long lines of
people trekked along railway lines to higher ground. Large
stretches of green rice fields disappeared under brown floodwater.
	   In Seoul, subway service was disrupted during busy commuting
hours when water submerged tracks.
	   President Kim Dae-jung ordered the military to send soldiers and
equipment to step up relief efforts.
	   The downpours mostly affected Seoul and regions near the North
Korean border, 60 kilometers (37 miles) north of the capital.
Weather officials could not immediately tell how much rain fell in
North Korea, where famine is spreading after years of floods,
droughts and other bad weather.
	   On Wednesday night, a Korean Air passenger plane skidded off a
rain-slicked runway while landing at Seoul's Kimpo International
Airport, injuring 22 people.
	   The flight, carrying 397 passengers from Tokyo's Narita airport,
bounced and skidded before coming to a halt in a meadow. One of the
airport's two runways remained closed Thursday, forcing delays in
landings.

U.S., Russia conduct joint naval exercises
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   VLADIVOSTOK, Russia (AP) _ U.S. and Russian troops practiced
joint rescue operations Thursday, part of two days of naval
exercises moved to a new location because of protests from local
veterans and communists, news reports said.
	   The maneuvers, which simulate joint operations to assist
earthquake victims, were moved to a location 70 kilometers (45
miles) south of Vladivostok.
	   About 50 Russian protesters jeered the USS Germantown when it
docked in Vladivostok on Tuesday, one of a number of demonstrations
that convinced Russian commanders to move the maneuvers from their
original site on the city's outskirts.
	   The protesters accused the United States of practicing an
invasion of Russia. Some opponents threatened to continue their
protest by blocking the maneuvers with small fishing vessels.
	   The maneuvers are part of Cooperation at Sea exercises, and
1,200 participants _ 600 from each side _ are taking part. It's the
third time since 1994 that the U.S. 7th Fleet and Russia's Pacific
Fleet have held joint exercises.

Outcry over withholding of funds from Holocaust survivors
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By JACK KATZENELL &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ A public outcry erupted Thursday in Israel over
the disclosure that government bureaucrats withheld German
reparation funds that could be used to improve the lot of hundreds
of Holocaust survivors in mental hospitals.
	   Millions of dollars in reparations are sitting in the patients'
bank accounts, but officials have failed to approve the funds' use
to alleviate bleak conditions for the elderly survivors.
	   The controversy came to light when doctors at Abarbanel hospital
near Tel Aviv said government trustees had refused to allow the
money to be spent on quality-of-life measures for the patients,
such as televisions, air conditioners and holiday parties.
	   The Maariv newspaper quoted Chief Rabbi Israel Meir Lau, himself
a Holocaust survivor, as saying he was ``deeply shocked.'' Lau
proposed that a psychiatrist and a social worker be assigned to
assist the government official who controls the funds ``to add a
personal and moral dimension to his decisions.''
	   Avraham Hirschson, head of a parliamentary committee dealing
with reparations to Holocaust survivors, asked Speaker Dan Tichon
to recall lawmakers from their summer recess for an emergency
debate on the ``the disgraceful exploitation of Holocaust
survivors' funds.''
	   Avner Shalev, chairman of Yad Vashem, Israel's Holocaust
memorial and museum, said he was ``simply astounded by the
insensitivity and the malice'' of the officials involved.
	   He proposed that control of the funds be transferred to a body
``with the sensitivity needed to work with Holocaust survivors.''
	   About 900 of the 360,000 Holocaust survivors who live in Israel
are believed to be in mental hospitals.
	   Most have been institutionalized since they came to Israel in
the 1940s and '50s and were unable to adjust to life in a new
Jewish state that wanted to look to the future rather than remember
past sufferings.
	   The survivors, many in their 80s, suffer from illnesses that
include acute depression and schizophrenia, which are attributed to
their experiences in the Nazi death camps.
	   Some have accumulated large sums of money in reparations from
the German government, receiving as much as several hundred dollars
a month for the past four decades. The Maariv newspaper estimated
that altogether the patients have several million dollars.
	   Due to their mental illnesses, these survivors were made wards
of the state. Their bank accounts are administered by the
court-appointed Fund for the Care of Dependents, which is
supervised by the government's General Custodian for Wards,
attorney Shmuel Tsur.
	   Tsur and fund director Avi Angel blame each other for the
failure to release the funds.
	   Jonathan Lemberger, head of a support organization for Holocaust
survivors, said the situation was symptomatic of a wider problem.
He also said the state was withholding other Holocaust reparation
money, including the legacies of survivors who died without heirs.
	   ``The mental patients' accounts are only the tip of the
iceberg,'' he said.

Thai Democrats won't support absentee lawmakers in next election
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) _ Annoyed by the routine absences of some
of its own lawmakers during Thai Parliament sessions, the ruling
Democrat party threatened Thursday not to support them for
re-election.
	   At least six Democrats were among the 31 members of Parliament
who did not show up at Wednesday's session. Their absence meant
there was no quorum, and so a debate on some laws was suspended
after the opposition asked for a roll call.
	   Charoen Phanthuwongse, deputy party whip, said he was very upset
with the absent lawmakers.
	   ``They deserve punishment. They are not doing their jobs, so we
will propose the party not support them in the next election,'' he
said.
	   Boonchu Rojanasathien, the Democrat party's adviser, said he
will ask the party to look into the record of Democrats who
repeatedly miss meetings and show it to the media to embarrass
them, according to Thai Channel Seven television.
	   Wan Noor Muhammad Matha, Parliament's speaker, said the practice
should also be applied for opposition party members who miss
sessions.
	   ``As members of Parliament and lawmakers, regardless of which
side they are on, they all should always give top priority to
Parliament sessions because it is their duty,'' he said.

Tajikistan's second-ranking Muslim leader killed
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   DUSHANBE, Tajikistan (AP) _ The body of Tajikistan's
second-highest Muslim leader has been found with fatal gunshot
wounds in a small village, a week after he was kidnapped, officials
said Thursday.
	   Domullo Kiyomeddin, head of the Khodzha Yakubi Charkhi mosque,
was kidnapped from his home in the capital Dushanbe last week,
Interior Ministry spokesman Dzhumakhon Khotamov said.
	   Two bodies were found Monday in the village of Tomchi-Bolo, some
20 kilometers (12 miles) from Dushanbe, in a region controlled by
the opposition. The bodies were later identified as those of
Kiyomeddin and one of his students, Khotamov said. Both were
apparently shot to death.
	   The coalition of main opposition groups issued a statement
Thursday, denouncing the killing and urging a thorough
investigation, opposition spokesman Sulton Khamadov said.
	   Kiyomeddin was considered the second-ranking religious figure in
Tajikistan, and it was not known if he had links to any political
group.
	   The Tajik government and the main opposition groups signed a
peace treaty last year, ending a five-year civil war in this former
Soviet republic, but sporadic clashes have continued.

D'Amato calls on Switzerland to unblock Kosovo accounts
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BERN, Switzerland (AP) _ A U.S. senator has called on
Switzerland to unblock accounts frozen amid suspicions they were
used to channel cash to Kosovo independence fighters, Swiss Foreign
Ministry officials said Thursday.
	   The ministry confirmed a report in the Berner Zeitung daily that
Sen. Alfonse D'Amato, a leading critic of Switzerland in the
controversy over Holocaust-era assets, wrote in a letter to the
Swiss embassy in Washington that he didn't understand the
authorities' action.
	   He called on the Swiss ambassador to the United States, Alfred
Defago, to provide an explanation, saying people in Kosovo needed
support.
	   Swiss authorities last week froze an account held by the Kosovo
Information Center and another run by the Popular Movement of
Kosovo, a group supporting the Kosovo Liberation Army.
	   D'Amato wrote of the information center's humanitarian
character, the foreign ministry said.
	   Xhafer Shatri, a Geneva-based spokesman for the center, close to
moderate ethnic Albanian leader Ibrahim Rugova, insisted last week
the money had always been used for ``humanitarian, social, cultural
and educational purposes.'' He didn't say how much the account
contained.
	   Juerg Blaser, spokesman for the Federal Prosecutor's Office,
said Thursday Switzerland wants to free money for humanitarian use
as soon as possible, but must first establish whether that is its
intended use.
	   He declined to say whether investigations had revealed any new
information.
	   Last week, Blaser said a Geneva location had been searched and
documents were confiscated, but declined to give further details.
The raid was part of an operation in which police also searched the
homes of three PMK members in eastern Switzerland.

	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ A public outcry erupted Thursday in Israel over

called the allegations shocking. He said he planned to visit the
patients and try to ease their plight.
	   ``I think the power of every moral society depends on its
approach to the weakest, and our weakest are Holocaust survivors
who are not healthy in mind and spirit,'' he said.

 &UR; Imprisoned British trader Nick Leeson has cancer
 &UR; Eds: RECASTS and UPDATES throughout with statement from British
lawyer saying cancer has spread from colon to lymph system; comment
from ex-wife &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ Imprisoned securities trader Nick Leeson, whose
futures dealing brought down Britain's oldest merchant bank, is
suffering from colon cancer which has spread to his lymph nodes,
his lawyers said Thursday.
	   Leeson, 31, has been taken to Changi Prison hospital in
Singapore, where he is serving a 6 1/2 year sentence for two
cheating charges stemming from the 1995 crash of Barings bank.
	   A statement from his London-based law firm Kingsley Napley said:
``On Aug. 5 in Singapore Nick Leeson was diagnosed as suffering
from cancer of the colon which has spread to his lymph nodes. As
can be imagined, Mr. Leeson's family and that of his ex-wife Lisa
are devastated at the news.''
	   Leeson's solicitor Stephen Pollard said in a later statement
that his client was still waiting for a prognosis on the
seriousness of his condition.
	   ``It is anticipated that he may know more about the prognosis
next week, and when we have more news this will be released,'' he
said.
	   The Singapore Prisons Department said in a statement faxed to
The Associated Press: ``We confirm that he has been diagnosed with
cancer of the colon and that he is receiving treatment.''
	   Prison officials refused to answer other questions, including
whether Leeson would be allowed to transfer to another hospital, be
seen by a physician of his choice, or be released early if he were
dying. Pollard refused to say whether he might ask for Leeson's
transfer.
	   Lisa Leeson, 30, who has not seen her ex-husband in more than a
year and is due to remarry later this month, expressed ``deep
shock'' at the news of his illness.
	   Leeson, the son of a plasterer, was raised on a public housing
project at Watford, near London, speaks with a regional accent, and
never went to university. His father, William, who lives in
Watford, said he learned of his son's illness Wednesday from the
lawyers.
	   Asked if he thought conditions in the Singapore jail had
contributed to his son's condition, the elder Leeson replied: ``No.
The jail ... is as good as gold.''
	   Leeson lost dlrs 1.38 billion speculating on Asian stock markets
from his base in Singapore. British investigators concluded that
financial controls within Barings were ``woefully inadequate'' and
faulted the Bank of England for not keeping close enough tabs on
Barings.
	   Barings went broke in February 1995 after Leeson wrongly bet
that Tokyo stock prices would rise. The bank was taken over by the
Dutch banking and insurance company, ING Group.
	   Leeson began serving his sentence in December 1995.
	   The British High Commission in Singapore says he is being
visited regularly by consular officials.
	   A movie, ``Rogue Trader,'' based on a book Leeson wrote in
Germany while fighting extradition to Singapore, is due for release
next year. It stars Ewan McGregor and Anna Friel.

Ashrawi quits Palestinian Cabinet in protest

<TEXT>
	   RAMALLAH, West Bank (AP) _ Hanan Ashrawi, a leading figure in
Palestinian politics, quit the government Thursday, criticizing
Yasser Arafat over corruption and handling of peace talks.
	   ``I will continue to serve and work as a (legislative) council
member, but not as a member of this government,'' she told a news
conference in the West Bank town of Ramallah.
	   Arafat announced a new Cabinet on Wednesday, a year after
legislators demanded the old one be dissolved because of widespread
corruption. But all of the ministers accused of corruption kept
their jobs.
	   Ashrawi, who had been minister of higher education since 1996,
said she declined to accept a new appointment as tourism minister
because ``I believe that comprehensive reform was not addressed in
this new government formulation.''
	   ``I assured Arafat that once he conducts ...genuine reform, I
will be willing to help him,'' said Ashrawi, who ran for the
legislature on an anti-corruption platform.
	   Ashrawi also said she was unhappy with the handling of peace
talks with Israel.
	   ``I am not happy with the conduct of the negotiations,'' she
said. ``I could not continue to look the other way.''
	   She said she was not part of the inner circle responsible for
decision-making on the peace process, but that she disagreed with
the Palestinian leadership's political approach to the
negotiations. She did not elaborate.
	   Israel and the Palestinians have held high-level talks for the
past two weeks in an effort to revive the peace negotiations, which
bogged down 16 months ago.
	   During Israeli-Palestinian peace negotiations in the early
1990s, Ashrawi gained a worldwide reputation as an articulate
spokeswoman for the Palestinian cause. She is also a well-known
human rights and women's rights activist.
	   A former professor of English at Bir Zeit University in the West
Bank town of Ramallah, Ashrawi headed the Independent Commission
for Human Rights until she won a seat in the Palestinian
Legislative Council in 1996.
	   She comes from a prominent Palestinian Christian family and has
published several books in both English and Arabic.

Suspect in Taiwanese politician's death confesses: report
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES throughout with reported confession &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   BEIJING (AP) _ A suspect in the kidnapping of a Taiwanese
politician says the woman died from injections of knockout drugs,
the official Xinhua News Agency reported Thursday.
	   Huang Shidong, captured Tuesday, said he was part of a gang of
five men who abducted Lin Ti-chuan, 32, and her boyfriend Wei
Dan-kang on July 27, Xinhua said.
	   After being given several injections, Lin began having trouble
breathing, and the gang took her to a hospital in the northern town
of Haicheng, where she died July 29, it quoted Huang as saying.
	   Huang was quoted as saying the kidnapping had been an attempt to
force payment of business debts owed by Wei, who escaped his
captors and alerted police July 28.
	   The case has deepened perceptions in Taiwan that Chinese
officials neglect the safety of Taiwanese in China, where many have
business dealings. Such incidents put a damper on Taiwanese tourism
in China, and some Taiwanese politicians have called for a
suspension of investment and exchanges with China.
	   Doctors performing an autopsy on Lin, who was a city council
deputy from southern Kaohsiung, discovered five pin pricks in her
right arm, the China Daily reported. No other external wounds were
found, but results of laboratory tests of blood and tissue samples
taken from her will not be available for several days, the official
paper said.
	   Lin's remains will be returned to Kaohsiung Saturday, Lin's
aides told Taiwanese media.
	   Police arrested another suspected accomplice, Zhang Shifeng, on
Thursday, but were still searching for three main suspects, Xinhua
said.
	   More than 200 detectives have been mobilized to hunt for the
three, who include a manager of a trading company that was
reportedly owed U.S. dlrs 700,000 by Wei, police said.
	   Both Taipei and Beijing have sought to prevent the incident from
slowing gradual movement toward a renewal of their dialogue, broken
off in 1995.
	   Mindful of the Taiwanese public's sensitivity over such
incidents, China's state media have portrayed officials as anxious
to accommodate Lin's family.
	   The Haicheng business community has contributed 85,000 yuan
(U.S. dlrs 10,240) toward the cost of returning Lin's remains,
Xinhua said.

Two women reported dead in sweeping fires in southern Croatia
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By EUGENE BRCIC &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   ZAGREB, Croatia (AP) _ State officials declared a state of
emergency in southern Croatia Thursday as rampant brush and forest
fires, fanned by gale-force winds, claimed two lives and devoured
scores of homes and other property.
	   Forests were ablaze in more than 40 sites across the region by
early morning. By noon, the situation was close to critical in many
places.
	   ``The weather conditions are hampering our efforts, and it won't
be until the strong winds subside that we'll be able to be more
effective,'' said Slavko Rako, an Interior Ministry spokesman.
	   ``Extra recruits are being dispatched and firefighting planes
are being directed from less critical areas to those where the
situation is more serious,'' Rako added.
	   Southern Croatia has been in the throes of more than a week of
extremely hot, dry weather, often aggravated by high winds that can
quickly whip a fire out of control and turn huge forests into
tinderboxes.
	   On the Adriatic peninsula of Peljesac, where the fires were most
destructive, more than a thousand people, including some 350
foreign tourists, had to be evacuated by firefighting crews.
	   Scorching through more than 2,000 hectares (4,800 acres) of
mostly underbrush and pines, the fires destroyed scores of cars,
stables as well as livestock.
	   Planes were on hand to help combat the flames, and volunteer
firefighters were summoned from neighboring towns, but gusting
winds impeded access because of the high risk involved.
	   Two women, who reportedly stayed behind to fight the flames from
engulfing their homes, were reportedly killed. They were the first
fire casualties reported during this season's heat wave.
	   In the central Adriatic city of Zadar, of 28 fires raging since
Wednesday night, four were yet to be contained Thursday.
	   Southern Croatia, known as Dalmatia, is a sparsely populated
region with small isolated towns along the coastline. The towns are
separated by long stretches of dry land, dotted by brush and pine
growth. The region is highly susceptible to fires in summer as
temperatures soar and the population swells with tourists.

England 63 for one at lunch
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   LEEDS, England (AP) _ Fast bowler Makhaya Ntini gave South
Africa its only breakthrough in the opening morning of the fifth
cricket test at Headingly Thursday, dismmissing England opener Mike
Ahterton for 16.
	   England skipper Alec Stewart won the toss and elected to bat
first, his team reaching 63 for one at lunch after the first
session of the deciding test.
	   In extremely windy conditions, South Africa's new ball attack _
Allan Donald and Shaun Pollock _ struggled for rhythm as the
England's openers Mark Butcher, 37 not out in 113 minutes, and
Atherton put on 45 runs for the first wicket.
	   Atherton, who had greeted Ntini's first ball with a cover driven
boundary, pushed tentatively to an outswinger and second slip
Jacques Kallis completed a comfortable catch.
	   Atherton, England's fourth test hero with an unbeaten 98 in its
eight-wicket series levelling win, faced just six balls from Donald
in his 76 minutes stay at the crease.
	   Donald, who was fined half his match fee and received a
suspended one-match suspension for criticizing English umpire Merv
Kitchen on the eve of the test, has vowed to dismiss Atherton in
this test.
	   Butcher, who edged Pollock just short of Gary Kirsten at gully,
has hit five boundaries so far while Hussain has kept him company
with five not out in 35 minutes.
	   South African skipper Hansie Cronje tried out five bowlers in
the 26.2 overs before lunch, seven of them from Donald, who
conceded 18 runs.

Oldest-known sentence in Dutch was from a love letter
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   AMSTERDAM, Netherlands (AP) _ So what's a nice wench like you
doing around a monastery like this?
	   Scholars claim to have found the oldest-known complete sentence
written in the Dutch language, and the phrase _ scribbled by a
medieval monk sometime around 1100 _ sounds more like a pickup line
than a religious text.
	   The sentence, contained in a tattered notebook to go on display
Aug. 19 at Amsterdam's New Church, is archaically phrased and bears
little resemblance to modern-day Dutch.
	   The Flemish flirtation reads like this: ``All the birds have
begun building their nests. Except you and me _ what are we waiting
for?''
	   Amsterdam's thriving gay community has co-opted the line under
the assumption that the writer was romancing a fellow monk, Het
Financieele Dagblad reported Thursday.
	   But other scholars, noting that celibacy for clerics was not
strictly enforced in the Middle Ages, contend the monk may well
have been romancing a woman, the newspaper said.

Death toll tops 2,000 in China's summer floods
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: RECASTS to UPDATE throughout with official saying floodwater
might be diverted, other details; adds byline &QL; 
 &UR; By JOHN LEICESTER &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   BEIJING (AP) _ With more than 2,000 people already dead from
flooding, China's government said Thursday it was ready to take the
last-ditch step of breaking open dikes along the raging Yangtze
River to protect areas downstream.
	   The decision on whether to safeguard some areas by inundating
others could come as early as Friday, when a flood tide surging
down the river approaches a major embankment already weakened by
weeks of devastating floods and rain, officials said.
	   While officials said they believed such a step would not prove
necessary, that they were considering it was an indication of the
pressures wrought by the worst flooding along the Yangtze in more
than four decades.
	   The figure of more than 2,000 dead in this year's summer flood
season, announced at a government news conference Thursday, was 700
higher than previous official figures. The floods have affected 240
million people, or a fifth of the population, to varying degrees,
said Fan Baojun, vice minister of civil affairs.
	   About 90 percent of those killed died in mountain floods,
landslides and mudflows that swallowed houses and villages, he
said.
	   Main embankments that hem in the Yangtze, the world's
third-longest river, so far have held firm, protecting millions of
people and rich farmland from its floodwaters.
	   But a flood peak _ the fourth so far this year _ was expected to
reach the weakened Jingjiang dike in central China's flood-hit
Hubei province within the next two days, forcing officials to
consider flooding an area south of the dike to protect the levee
itself.
	   ``The possibility of flood diversion cannot be discounted,''
said Zhao Chunming, a deputy director for flood control.
``Preparations have already been made.''
	   ``We will try our best not to divert water unless it is
absolutely necessary,'' he added.
	   Other officials at the news conference, however, hastily sought
to qualify Zhao's remarks.
	   ``According to the situation now, it doesn't look like we need
to divert water,'' Zhou Wenzhi, a vice minister of water resources,
said.
	   Water levels at Hubei's Shashi city, near the dike, were at a
record high, state-run television reported Thursday. Zhou said the
Yangtze at Shashi could reach heights Friday that would enable the
State Council, or Cabinet, to approve flood diversion.
	   While main Yangtze dikes have held firm, secondary levees have
collapsed, inundating swathes of farmland. Some were deliberately
abandoned to take the pressure off major levees, said Zhao. Other
secondary dikes could also be abandoned if main Yangzte dikes are
endangered, he said.
	   Hubei, among the worst hit provinces, declared a state of
emergency Thursday, the official Xinhua News Agency reported. It
said that with water levels expected to rise further, provincial
authorities issued a ``do or die'' order to local residents to help
safeguard major cities and levees.
	   Flooding has also caused serious damage in northeastern China,
in central Shaanxi province, and in southern Guangdong and Guangxi.
	   On Wednesday, two days after the end of the period covered by
the latest death toll, a levee that protected 35,000 people in
Jiujiang city, along the Yangtze in south China, gave way, but
officials said Thursday there were no reports of casualties.
	   But the bodies of 13 people were recovered in Jiayu, a county
upstream where a levee collapsed Saturday, the official Hubei Daily
reported. Nineteen soldiers swept away when the dike burst were
missing, the official China Daily added.
	   After weeks of rain, dikes along the Yangtze are saturated and
threaten to give way at any time in thousands of places. Millions
of residents and soldiers patrol around the clock, on the lookout
for cracks or signs of weakness. Neck deep in water, they plug
holes and shore up the levees with sandbags, stones and wooden
stakes in anticipation of several more weeks of battle with the
river.

Police seize 1 million compact discs and pornographic video discs
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   HONG KONG (AP) _ Hong Kong customs officials on Thursday seized
1 million pirated compact discs and pornographic video discs valued
at nearly U.S. dlrs 4 million.
	   Acting on an anonymous tip, customs officers raided two compact
disc factories and one warehouse, seizing discs worth 30 million
Hong Kong dollars, Television Broadcast reported in its evening
English news.
	   Eight unidentified people were arrested in the raids. If found
guilty, they could face penalties of up to 500,000 Hong Kong
dollars (U.S. dlrs 64,000) and two years in prison each, Television
Broadcast said.
	   The raid also yielded production equipment.
	   Hong Kong officials are under pressure, particularly from the
United States, to do a better job of protecting intellectual
property. U.S. officials say Hong Kong has become a production and
distribution center for pirated discs since officials in mainland
China began cracking down.
	   Early this year, U.S. officials decided to keep Hong Kong on a
watch list for copyright violation.
	   In April, officers of Hong Kong's anti-corruption agency seized
7 million pirated video discs and production equipment worth 650
million Hong Kong dollars (U.S. dlrs 83 million), the biggest such
seizure in Hong Kong's history.

Judge's report indicts right-wing state government for Hindu-Muslim
</HEADLINE>
riots &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   BOMBAY, India (AP) _ The Hindu nationalist state government on
Thursday rejected a judge's report accusing ruling party leaders of
inciting the 1992 Hindu-Muslim riots that killed about 800 people
in India's largest city .
	   ``The report is anti-Hindu, pro-Muslim and we do not accept
it,'' said Manohar Joshi, top elected official of western
Maharashtra state, while presenting the judge's findings to state
legislature.
	   ``It's a biased report,'' Joshi said. The report was not
immediately available to reporters in Bombay, capital of
Maharashtra state.
	   Joshi's Shiv Sena Party shares power in Bombay with the
rightwing Bharatiya Janata Party. Both are staunch Hindu
nationalists.
	   Joshi told lawmakers that Judge B.N. Srikrishna had also
criticized the then Congress Party government in the state, the
police and bureaucracy for lack of prompt action to contain the
rioting.
	   Angry lawmakers interrupted Joshi, asking him to instead read
out the report. Joshi went ahead airing his views, but appealed to
Hindus and Muslims to maintain peace. ``The violence that took
place should never happen again,'' he said.
	   Thousands of policemen were on alert in the city to prevent
violence.
	   The report was presented in the state legislature six months
after Srikrishna completed his investigation into the riots. The
violence was sparked by the demolition of a historic mosque in the
northern town of Ayodhya by Hindu fundamentalists. A total of 2,000
people were killed nationwide.
	   Human rights groups accused the government of delaying the
report because they believe it blamed top Shiv Sena party leaders
for fomenting the riots. The government said the delay was because
the report was being translated from English into the local Marathi
language.
	   Police have charged a Muslim underworld don and his gang with
setting off 13 bombs in Bombay in March 1993 to avenge the attack
on the mosque.

	   CAIRO, Egypt (AP) _ Egyptian private sector mobile phone
provider, Mobinil, signed two contracts with Motorola and Alcatel
to boost local service and nearly quadruple the number of available
lines, the London-based Al-Hayat reported Thursday.
	   Under the terms of the 400 million pound (dlrs 117 million)
deal, Motorola will upgrade the boosting stations and provide other
related technology, Mobinil officials were quoted as saying.
	   France's Alcatel will upgrade the mobile phone network to
increase the number of available lines.
	   By the end of the month, 160,000 lines will be available. The
figure is expected to increase to 300,000 by the end of 1998. By
the end of 2001, the company hopes to have quadrupled its existing
line services, the paper reported.
	   Mobinil, which went public in June after the government began
privatizing its telecommunications sector, has 120,000 subscribers.

	   KUWAIT (AP) _ Kuwait's Parliament has voted unanimously to
subject financial deals by state-owned agencies and companies to
the prior approval of the Audit Bureau, the country's financial
watchdog. But the government managed to exempt oil companies, the
Central Bank and the state investments from the new law.
	   The 50-seat house, which approved the measure Wednesday, said
the law was aimed at protecting public money from embezzlement.
	   Kuwait has lost billions of dinars to mismanagement and theft,
especially in its vast foreign investments, now estimated at dlrs
40 billion. The government argued prior approvals on oil deals,
investments and Central Bank dealings would create bottlenecks and
make it impossible for these agencies to carry out their business.

	   AMMAN, Jordan (AP) _ Share prices slipped this week, but
turnover increased on Jordan's stock exchange.
	   Brokers on Thursday attributed the sluggish activity to
political uncertainty, namely stalled Middle East peace talks, and
reports of King Hussein illness.
	   A report issued by stock exchange, reflecting activity for five
business days ending Wednesday, said the 60-company general share
prices index declined by 0.69 percent to 178.93 points.
	   Shares of commercial banks dropped by 0.97 percent, industrial
firms by 0.07 percent, and services sector by 0.09 percent, while
shares of insurance sector nudged up by 0.31 percent.
	   Turnover increased by 95.8 percent to 16.04 million Jordanian
dinars (dlrs 22.59 million), the report said.
	   Stocks of 94 firms were traded during the week, it said.
	   ___
	   KUWAIT (AP) _ The price index of the Kuwait Stock Exchange
closed at 2,124.3 points at the end of the trading week, down 18.5
points, or 0.86 percent from the previous week, the National
Investments Company said Thursday.
	   In a weekly report, the company said trading fell on profit
taking and to balance the hike in prices that resulted from
Parliament's amendment to the bad debts last week.
	   The law rescheduled the payment of billions of dinars in debts
that went bad in a 1982 stock market crash and were aggravated by
the Iraqi invasion of 1990. The government took over the debts from
banks after the 1991 liberation.
	   It was feared that a Sept. 6 deadline for payment would lead to
the liquidation of stock assets.
	   Some 407.44 million shares were traded this week, down by 4.65
percent from last week. The value of these shares also fell by
12.68 percent to 89.65 million dinars (dlrs 292.97 million).
	   Of the 75 companies listed on the exchange, 72 were traded, the
report said. Thirty-nine closed lower, 22 closed higher, and 11
were not changed. Trading on the KSE is restricted to Kuwaitis and
nationals of the other Arab states in the Gulf.
	   ___
	   AMMAN, Jordan (AP) _ Jordan and Romania agreed to remove
obstacles in the way of trade, officials said Thursday.
	   A 13-man Romanian trade delegation, led by Surin Potanc,
secretary-general of the Trade Ministry, conducted talks with
Jordanian officials and businessmen aimed at establishing better
trade relations and setting up joint industrial ventures.
	   Romania promised to facilitate visas, Jordanian officials said.
	   Both sides agreed to increase Jordanian exports to Romania,
including medicine and minerals, and the use of Aqaba Airport for
Romanian planes bound to Aqaba and Eilat, Israel.
	   Trade in 1997 was dlrs 29 million in Romania's favor.

Help arrives from abroad as fires rage unchecked

	   ATHENS, Greece (AP) _ Officials declared a state of emergency in
the greater Athens area Thursday as a wind-whipped fire engulfed
homes and killed at least one person.
	   Firefighting aircraft and personnel arrived from Italy and
France to help battle forest fires that raged around Greece,
including a wall of flames that threatened to engulf the ancient
site of the Olympic games.
	   France sent three firefighting planes and fire crews. Italy
dispatched two planes, while a French aircraft to coordinate
efforts also arrived.
	   A brush fire was within about a kilometer (1/2 mile) of the more
than 2,000-year-old monuments of Ancient Olympia, about 185
kilometers (110 miles) southwest of Athens, police said.
	   On Mount Pendeli near Athens, a man was found burned to death
inside his home in an area where firefighters struggled against
winds of up to 88 kilometers per hour (54 mph), the fire department
said.
	   A state of emergency was called for all of Attica, the province
that includes Athens and the main port, Piraeus. More than half of
Greece's 11 million people live in Attica.
	   More than 1,500 soldiers and firefighters joined to battle the
Pendeli blaze, which raged through one of the last tracts of
woodlands ringing Athens. Winds pushed the flames toward suburbs.
	   ``We have some control of the fire,'' said regional fire chief
Panagiotis Fourlas. ``But we can't say we have it under full
control yet because of this wind. We're very worried about some of
the fires rekindling.''
	   Officials evacuated several facilities, including hospitals and
a residential home for the elderly. A local monastery was also
threatened by the flames.
	   Electricity pylons and power lines were also damaged, leading to
frequent power outages throughout the capital.
	   Another fire on Mount Taygetos in southern Greece was reportedly
brought under partial control after burning since July 27.
	   Forest and brush fires are common during Greece's hot and dry
summers. But this season has been declared one of the worst in
decades.
	   In July alone, more than 3,000 wildfires were reported compared
with 2,800 for the entire summer season last year, the government
said. Officials suspect arson in some of the blazes.
	   Last month, four firefighters perished during a forest fire on
the eastern edge of Athens.

French soccer on a high as new season kicks off

	   PARIS (AP) _ Boosted by the country's spectacular World Cup
success, France's soccer season kicks off Friday with top clubs
stemming the outward flow of talent that has long dogged the
domestic league.
	   In the first round of matches, Le Havre plays last year's
runner-up Metz, while Monaco travels to newly-promoted Lorient.
Seven other games will be played Saturday.
	   At the start of recent seasons, French clubs have counted the
cost of lost talent, with players quickly heading for the more
lucrative and glamorous leagues of Italy, Spain or England.
	   When France won the World Cup July 12, only eight of the 22-man
squad - and only two of the 14 who took part that night - played
for French clubs.
	   But over the summer, France's three most powerful clubs -
Marseille, Monaco and Paris Saint-Germain - have shown that they
are better able to attract, and keep, top talent.
	   Just before the World Cup, Metz midfielder Robert Pires, widely
considered as the best young player to emerge in France for several
years, resisted an offer from English champion Arsenal, moving
instead to Marseille for a then French record 60 million francs
(dlrs 10 million).
	   And since helping France to World Cup success, young Monaco
stars Thierry Henry and David Trezeguet have turned down offers
from abroad.
	   Since the World Cup victory, only one French World Cup player -
third-choice goalkeeper Lionel Charbonnier of Auxerre - has quit
the French league.
	   One other, second-choice goalkeeper Bernard Lama, has moved the
other direction, rejoining PSG from England's West Ham.
	   Top French clubs are also doing more to make the French league a
home for top foreign players.
	   Italians Marco Simone and Fabrizio Ravanelli, the league's two
biggest foreign stars, were widely expected to leave France over
the summer, but have decided to stay at PSG and Marseille
respectively.
	   During the summer break PSG beat a clutch of top European clubs
to sign Nigerian star Jay-Jay Okocha for a French record 100
million francs (17 million dlrs) and German international defender
Christian Woerns, who was out of contract at Bayer Leverkusen.
	   ``I convinced Okocha of the ambitions of the club, of its new
generation of players, and the quality of the Paris public. In
doing that, the World Cup helped me,'' said Charles Bietry, PSG
president.
	   Still, less wealthy clubs have found it harder to keep their top
players.
	   Unable to pay top wages, last year's championship winner Lens
and runner-up Metz lost a clutch of key players.
	   Jean-Guy Wallemme, Stephane Ziani and Anto Drobnjak left Lens
for foreign fields and only injury prevented Marc-Vivien Foe from
leaving Lens for the English league.
	   Metz lost Jocelyn Blanchard and Rigobert Song to Italian clubs.
	   But by persuading former Metz star Pires to stay in France,
Marseille bucked the trend.
	   An eight-time champion of France, Marseille bought big this
summer.
	   Boosted by a French-record 34,000 season ticket holders - nearly
double last season's figure - and continued private investment from
Adidas president Robert Louis-Dreyfus, the club forked out more
than 130 million francs (dlrs 22 million) to bring Pires, PSG's
Florian Maurice, Nantes' Jocelyn Gourvennec and Lyon's Daniel Bravo
to the Stade Velodrome.
	   Marseille's longtime rival PSG witnessed a summer revolution.
	   Though PSG won both domestic cups last season, seventh place in
the championship standings was considered a disaster for France's
richest club.
	   Alain Giresse took over from Ricardo as manager, and the club's
owner and main financial backer, Cable TV station Canal +,
appointed Bietry as president to replace Michel Denisot.
	   In addition to internationals Okocha, Woerns and Lama, PSG also
spent heavily on Brazilian striker Adailton from Italy's Parma,
Nantes midfielder Bruno Carotti and Auxerre defender Alain Goma.
	   The third heavily-tipped challenger for the championship, 1997
winner Monaco, was less active over the summer, but was delighted
that coach Jean Tigana - tipped as a possible successor to Aime
Jacquet as boss of the national team - stayed at the club.
	   Though Monaco sold key midfielders John Collins and Ali
Benarbia, it is strengthened by the arrival of French
internationals Sabri Lamouchi and Franck Gava.
	   Even though they don't have the pulling power of Marseille, PSG
and Monaco, other clubs say that they are benefiting from the
country's World Cup success.
	   Almost all report higher season ticket numbers.

South African ministers to hold crisis talks with Kabila
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   CAPE TOWN, South Africa (AP) _ Three South African ministers
will meet with Congo President Laurent Kabila Friday to discuss the
renewed civil war there, the government said.
	   Foreign Minister Alfred Nzo told a news conference Thursday he
would fly to the southern Congolese city of Lubumbashi together
with Safety and Security Minister Sydney Mufamadi and Defense
Minister Joe Modise.
	   Foreign affairs officials said they hoped to meet Kabila, who
faces an armed uprising in eastern Congo, on Friday, but no final
arrangements had been confirmed.
	   Officials in neighboring Zimbabwe say they plan to host a
regional meeting on Congo that also will involve Kabila, along with
the leaders of Namibia, Zambia, Rwanda and Uganda. The officials
have issued conflicting dates of both Friday and Saturday.
	   With the rebellion emerging from the same region where Kabila
began his own revolution two years ago, the Congolese president is
faced by former allies in the biggest challenge to his government
so far.
	   The rebels are believed to include Banyamulenge _ Congolese
Tutsi fighters _ and Rwandan soldiers who remained in Congo after
playing a key role in Kabila's victory over longtime Zairian
dictator Mobutu Sese Seko last year.
	   Nzo said the South African delegation would be urge Kabila to
reform his government to include a broader span of political
opinion. Human rights groups have accused Kabila of suppressing
political opponents.
	   ``We are not carrying solutions in our pockets,'' Nzo said.
	   With the threat of renewed civil war also looming in Angola, Nzo
said it was vital peaceful solutions were sought to prevent
conflict spreading to neighboring countries.
	   Kabila accuses Rwanda of invading his country, while Rwanda has
accused Congo of failing to control Hutu rebels, many of whom set
up bases in eastern Congo after a 1994 ethnic slaughter of more
than half a million people, mainly Tutsis.

	   KINSHASA, Congo (AP) _ Embattled by a widening rebellion in
eastern Congo, President Laurent Kabila's government threatened
Thursday to wage war against neighboring Rwanda, which it accused
of masterminding the uprising.
	   Government spokesman Didier Mumenge warned that Congo would
``extend the war into Rwanda'' unless the international community
pressured the tiny country to withdraw Rwandan troops allegedly
deployed in Congo.
	   Mumenge described Rwanda as a ``criminal state'' that had
meddled in foreign affairs while drawing on ``a feeling of pity by
the international community'' since the 1994 Rwandan genocide.
	   He was referring to the ethnic slaughter of more than half a
million people, mainly Tutsis, by Rwandan Hutu soldiers and
militants who were subsequently driven into hiding, from where they
have persistently attacked Rwanda's Tutsi-led government.
	   ``From now on the war will no longer be fought by the Congo
Armed Forces but that of all people in the Congo,'' Mumenge said.
	   The rebellion has sparked a backlash of anger by some residents
in Congo's capital of Kinshasa against Congolese Tutsis believed to
be receiving support from Rwanda.
	   About 5,000 supporters of the ruling party chanted and sang as
they marched through the streets of Kinshasa on Thursday, calling
for guns to join the fight against ``the Rwandan invaders.''
	   The marchers carried stuffed effigies of two former members of
Kabila's inner circle _ both Tutsis _ who have apparently defected
to the rebels.
	   The two figures were Kabila's former confidante Gratias Bugera,
a senior government advisor who went missing last week and
newly-fired foreign minister Bizima Karaha, who was said to be in
the eastern town of Goma, with rebels who had captured the town.
	   The demonstrators, led by two popular musicians, said they
planned to chop off the heads of the effigies before the protest
ends.
	   Several Kinshasa businesses owned by Tutsis were reportedly
robbed and burned Wednesday by local residents after a dusk-to-dawn
curfew was lifted.
	   Three South African ministers were expected to fly to Congo's
southern city of Lubumbashi on Friday to meet with Kabila to
discuss the hostilities, South African Foreign Minister Alfred Nzo
said on Thursday.
	   Zimbabwe, which is supplying 10 military advisors to Kabila's
government according to a Harare newspaper, has said it plans to
host a mini-summit of regional leaders Friday or Saturday over the
conflict.

International cycling body meets to discuss doping scandal
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   PARIS (AP) _ Top officials from cycling's governing body met
Thursday for the first time since the scandal-plagued Tour de
France to discuss the sport's growing drug crisis.
	   The Tour de France, which finished August 2, was dominated by
revelations of drug taking among top cyclists.
	   The Festina team was thrown out of the race and six more teams
withdrew protesting police investigations.
	   The International Cycling Union (UCI) met in Paris ``to
elaborate a number of way to fight (doping) more efficiently,''
said the UCI.
	   UCI president Hein Verbruggen and vice presidents Agostino Omini
and Daniel Baal were at the meeting, along with Jean-Marie Leblanc,
president of the international association of cycling tour
organizers (AIOCC) and director of the company that organizes the
Tour de France.
	   Representatives from the international association of
professional cyclists (AIGCP) are expected to meet with UCI
officials late Thursday.
	   UCI officials didn't take any decisions at the Paris gathering
but have convened a second meeting in Lausanne next week where
cyclists Marco Pantani, Erik Zabel, Michael Boogerd and Luc Leblanc
are expected to attend.

Singapore leader's memoirs to be published next month
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   SINGAPORE (AP) _ The forthcoming memoirs of Lee Kuan Yew contain
inside stories about the tumultuous years of Singapore's entry and
separation from the Malaysian Federation and are likely to cause
controversies, according to press statements Thursday by the
publishers.
	   Lee, the founder of modern Singapore and its prime minister for
31 years, is known for speaking bluntly and his criticism of
Malaysia has sparked problems between the two countries before.
	   The publication of his ``The Singapore Story: Memoirs of Lee
Kuan Yew'' on his birthday Sept. 16 could add fuel to the current
fire raging between the two governments.
	   What started with a dispute over where to locate a border post
on a railway line has escalated into calls by Malaysian politicians
to cut off Singapore's water supply, charges by Singaporean
politicians that Malaysia's port and harbor policies may be
internationally illegal, and almost daily attacks and responses in
the two countries' pro-government news media.
	   The same kind of controversy erupted last year after Lee _
Singapore's senior minister since giving up the prime minister's
post in 1990 _ made disparaging remarks in a court case about crime
in the Malaysian state across the Johor Strait. After the usual
scares about Singapore's continued supply of water from Malaysia,
the feud was declared over during a golf game between the two
foreign ministers.
	   A particularly sticky subject between the two countries is
history: particularly what motivated Lee Kuan Yew to bring
Singapore into the Malaysian Federation and whether the separation
in 1965 was a secession or an expulsion. Schoolchildren in each
country are taught the story differently.
	   ``Describing the motivations and concepts that have animated his
conduct and explain specific actions, Lee Kuan Yew will undoubtedly
raise many controversies,'' former U.S. Secretary of State Henry
Kissinger said of the book, according to the publishers' press
releases.
	   The first installment of the memoirs covers 1923-1965, from
shortly after Lee's birth to Singapore's independence from the
Malaysian Federation. The second installment is targeted for
release next year.
	   ``There are many interesting inside stories and invaluable
historical facts which he is making known for the first time,''
said a statement from Singapore Press Holdings, which is publishing
the book in cooperation with Simon and Schuster Asia and Times
Publishing, a Singapore company.
	   The English version will sell for 32 Singapore dollars (dlrs
18); and the Chinese version, translated by reporters and editors
from the Singapore newspaper Lianhe Zaobao, for 29.90 Singapore
dollars (dlrs 17).

England has world's richest soccer league
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ The Premier League is the richest soccer league in
the world but there is a growing gulf between England's top flight
and the lower divisions, according to a financial report released
Thursday.
	   The Premier League generated total revenues of 464 million
pounds (dlrs 754 million) in the 1996-97 season, the Deloitte and
Touche annual review of soccer finance said.
	   The 20 clubs generated an average annual income of 23.2 million
pounds (dlrs 37.7 million), the report found.
	   Total revenue of English soccer increased by 31 percent last
season to 675.7 million pounds (dlrs 1.1 billion), with the Premier
League contributing 68 percent.
	   By comparison, Italy's Serie A generated income of 377 million
pounds (dlrs 613 million), with the clubs turning over an average
20.9 million pounds (dlrs 34 million).
	   The Spanish Premera Liga grossed 232 million pounds (dlrs 377
million), with Spanish clubs averaging 11.6 million pounds (dlrs
18.85 million).
	   The English Premier League is growing further ahead of its
international rivals but the Football League clubs (divisions one,
two and three) are also starting to lose ground to it.
	   The five top clubs in the Premier League _ Manchester United,
Arsenal, Newcastle, Liverpool and Aston Villa _ had a combined
turnover greater than the combined turnover of all 72 Football
League clubs.
	   The Premier League clubs had an average operating profit of 4.3
million pounds (dlrs 7 million), while the clubs in all three
Football League competitions averaged operational losses.
	   Gerry Boon, head of the Deloitte and Touche football industry
team, said revenue from broadcasting going into the top clubs made
England's major domestic competition the richest in the world.
	   ``It's little wonder so many top overseas players want to play
in the Premier League,'' Boon said.
	   Some top-flight players are earning 30,000 pounds (dlrs 48,750)
a week, while the average wage for Premier League players increased
by 35 percent in 1996-97, compared with a 27 percent increase for
England's other professional soccer players.
	   Boon said the money going into English soccer was subsidizing
increased player salaries and transfer deals but was bypasing
smaller clubs.
	   ``Except for a handful of well-managed Football League clubs,
the day-to-day business of football is profitable only in the
Premier League,'' Boon said.
	   The review indicated that other English clubs with Premier
League ambitions were continuing to spend heavily to buy players to
achieve their goal, but the strategy would be impossible to
maintain.
	   Salaries at 12 clubs exceeded their annual turnovers, while a
further 35 clubs paid out more than two-thirds of their turnovers
in wages.
	   ``As the Bosman ruling (free transfers for non-contracted
European Union players) has more of an effect, clubs will pay more
to lock in their top names and to attract the players free to move
_ particularly big-name stars from overseas,'' Boon said.

	   KABUL, Afghanistan (AP) _ Afghanistan's ruling Taliban religious
militia pledged Thursday to pursue a military solution, rejecting
calls for peace from Russia and Uzbekistan.
	   In a statement, the Taliban Foreign Ministry rejected as
``shameful'' interference in its internal affairs a joint appeal by
Russia and Uzbekistan urging them to halt all military actions.
	   Russia and Uzbekistan on Wednesday urged all sides in the Afghan
conflict to find a peaceful solution. The United Nations' Security
Council also expressed concern Wednesday over the ``dangerous
escalation of the armed conflict'' and called for peace talks in
Afghanistan.
	   The Taliban, who control 85 percent of Afghanistan including the
capital, Kabul, said the recent successes of its forces were the
only hope of the people of the country.
	   ``We want to prevent the division of Afghanistan and establish a
100 percent Islamic law,'' the foreign ministry said, adding the
goal was to rid the country of ``evil and corrupt militias.''
	   The Taliban have imposed a strict version of Islamic law in
areas they control. Most women are barred from work and most girls
from school, music is banned, men are required to wear beards and
public mutilation of thieves is common.
	   Taliban said their advance was not a threat to neighboring
countries. Russia has long been fearful that the Taliban's strict
brand of Islam would spread to neighbors like Uzbekistan and other
former central Asian regions of the Soviet Union.

England 63 for one at lunch

<TEXT>
	   LEEDS, England (AP) _ Fast bowler Makhaya Ntini gave South
Africa its only breakthrough in the opening morning of the fifth
cricket test at Headingley Thursday, dismissing England opener Mike
Atherton for 16.
	   England skipper Alec Stewart won the toss and elected to bat
first, his team reaching 63 for one at lunch after the first
session of the deciding test. The two teams are tied at 1-1.
	   In extremely windy conditions, South Africa's new ball attack _
Allan Donald and Shaun Pollock _ struggled for rhythm as the
England's openers Mark Butcher, 37 not out in 113 minutes, and
Atherton put on 45 runs for the first wicket.
	   Atherton, who had greeted Ntini's first ball with a cover driven
boundary, pushed tentatively to an outswinger and second slip
Jacques Kallis completed a comfortable catch.
	   Atherton, England's fourth test hero with an unbeaten 98 in its
eight-wicket series levelling win, faced just six balls from Donald
in his 76-minute stay at the crease.
	   Donald, who was fined half his match fee and received a
suspended one-match suspension for criticizing English umpire Merv
Kitchen on the eve of the test, has vowed to dismiss Atherton in
this one.
	   The two players had a tense confrontation in the previous match
with Atherton repeatedly fending off menacing short deliveries from
the South African paceman.
	   Butcher, who edged Pollock just short of Gary Kirsten at gully,
hit five boundaries before lunch while Hussain kept him company
with five not out in 35 minutes.
	   South African skipper Hansie Cronje tried out five bowlers in
the 26.2 overs before lunch, seven of them from Donald, who
conceded 18 runs.

Still no separation attempt for Siamese twins
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) _ Doctors reported Thursday that Siamese
twin girls born June 9 remain too weak to undergo a surgical
attempt to separate them.
	   The girls, Chanathida and Chanyaporn Daensa, have been under
intensive care at King Mongkut Hospital since they were born and
have hardly developed as they neared two months of life, when
medical theory holds a separation attempt could be made.
	   Joined for 12 centimeters (4.8 inches) at their chests and
stomachs, they currently weigh only 4.7 kilograms (10.34 pounds),
under their original birth weight of 5 kilograms (11 pounds).
	   ``Their conditions have not progressed,'' said Dr. Dusit
Staworn, head of the medical team caring for the twins, who remain
on oxygen. ``The younger one also has lung problems.''
	   Any operation would be extremely delicate, since the upper
chambers of their hearts share the same wall and they share just
one liver. Their hearts beat at almost twice the normal rate.
	   ``The plan to separate them by operation has to be put off,''
Dusit said. ``We still have to closely watch their conditions, even
though we know they will face heart problems at one point.''
	   The father of the girls, Sompume Daensa, described in newspapers
as a poor worker in a provincial hospital, has asked that the
medical team save at least one of the girls.
	   The term Siamese twins was first used with Chang and Eng,
Chinese twins born in 1811 in Thailand, once known as Siam.

Kinkel urges EU police agency to fight Internet child porn
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   THE HAGUE, Netherlands (AP) _ Germany's foreign minister called
Thursday on the European police agency to play a bigger role in the
fight against child pornography and its distribution on the
Internet.
	   ``It is one of the ugliest crimes ... It has got a new dimension
because of the Internet,'' said Foreign Minister Klaus Kinkel after
visiting Europol headquarters in The Hague.
	   During his half-day visit, Kinkel got a closer look at Europol's
operations, which focus on cross-border trafficking of illicit
drugs and nuclear materials as well as illegal immigration, stolen
vehicles and money laundering.
	   Child pornography, especially its dissemination in cyberspace,
is not included in Europol's mandate except when it is linked to
child smuggling. The agency also has limited capabilities to police
the circulation of these materials.
	   But Kinkel said Europol should do more to stop criminals from
spreading child pornography on the Internet.
	   The foreign minister's visit followed weeks of commotion in the
Netherlands, Germany and Belgium over the discovery of a
Netherlands-based ring that trafficked pornography of children _
even infants _ around the world via the Internet.
	   In the apartment of convicted German pedophile Gerrie Ulrich in
the coastal town of Zandvoort, Dutch police seized computer
diskettes and video with shocking images of children as young as 12
months being raped and sodomized.
	   Authorities have suggested that most of the materials weren't
made in the Netherlands, just distributed from here. But the daily
De Telegraaf reported Thursday that Ulrich, who was slain in Italy
in June, had purchased vast amounts of expensive and sophisticated
digital video recording equipment used to make films.
	   The case has rekindled calls for tighter controls and laws of
against child pornographic materials on the Internet.
	   During roundtable discussions, Europol specialists briefed
Kinkel on the latest efforts to consolidate police intelligence
from the 15 EU nations to better tackle cross-border crimes.
	   Kinkel's visit came just months before the so-called Europol
Convention will take effect on Oct. 1.
	   Officials said the convention will give Europol the legal
framework it needs to fulfill its mandate and will usher in a new
information exchange system.
	   In the past, Europol investigators had to work through national
liaison officers to collect intelligence. With the central computer
program, they will have direct access to data in other member
nations.

Homeless return to train station after being forced away
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; AP Photo Planned &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   WARSAW, Poland (AP) _ Hours after police and railway guards
removed them Thursday, more than 20 homeless people returned to
Warsaw's main train station where they have found shelter for
years.
	   ``The homeless will not leave, even threatened by police batons,
because they have nowhere to go to,'' said Wieslaw Jez, who belongs
to an advocacy group for the homeless formed at the urging of Radio
Maryja, a conservative Catholic radio station.
	   Jez and other group members, some wearing Radio Maryja t-shirts,
demonstrated at the railway station with the two dozen homeless
people who were kicked out before dawn Thursday and returned later
in the morning.
	   According to rail health inspector Jolanta Szewczyk, dozens of
people sleep at the train station and up to 300 turn up daily for
meals distributed by Carmelite nuns.
	   Last week, Szewczyk warned that some of the squatters may be
infected with tuberculosis, jaundice and AIDS, and that they could
start an epidemic in the city of 1.5 million people.
	   Warsaw residents and city officials also object to the homeless,
saying they present a bad image to visitors to the capital.
	   But the squatters have refused to move to the city's four
centers offering 800 beds and demand a shelter of their own.
	   The government had planned to sell two hectares (five acres) of
land in Brwinow, outside of Warsaw, to the Carmelite nuns this week
for a shelter for the homeless. But the move was delayed by
negotiations over the sale, according to Wieslaw Olewinski of a
government agriculture agency.
	   Brwinow residents oppose building a homeless shelter in their
neighborhood.

Serb offensive continues despite U.S. threats
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with more fighting reported, EU approving dlrs 5.5
million in aid for Kosovo. RECASTS and TRIMS. &QL; 
 &UR; By ISMET HAJDARI &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   PRISTINA, Yugoslavia (AP) _ An all-out Serb offensive that has
already created a massive refugee crisis persisted in Kosovo
Thursday despite a new U.S. warning of Western military
intervention.
	   Serb sources said there was fierce fighting Thursday along the
main Pristina-Prizren road near the village of Crnoljevo, southwest
of Kosovo's capital, and clashes continued near the besieged
village Junik, close to the Albanian border.
	   Rival ethnic Albanians claimed Serb forces shelled villages in
the central Drenica region, including the village Likovac, where
U.S. envoy Christopher Hill met with Kosovo Liberation Army (KLA)
fighters last week.
	   Also under attack was the village of Pantina, a known ethnic
Albanian stronghold, northwest of Pristina, according to the
Albanian sources,
	   U.S. envoy Richard Holbrooke told CNN late Wednesday that the
possibility of intervention was increasing dramatically as the
Serbs press ahead with their offensive _ despite Yugoslav President
Slobodan Milosevic's promise last month to halt military operations
against KLA rebels.
	   Citing the latest wave of Serb violence _ which drove up to
200,000 ethnic Albanians from their homes _ the leader of Kosovo's
Albanians and officials in neighboring Albania have issued fresh
calls for outside intervention in the battered province.
	   The pleas Wednesday came as international sentiments remained
split over a possible military operation to try to halt the
conflict, which Holbrooke said has entered an ``extraordinarily
dangerous new phase.''
	   The KLA is fighting for independence for Kosovo, a province in
southern Serbia where ethnic Albanians represent 90 percent of the
population. Serbia and the smaller republic of Montenegro make up
what is left of Yugoslavia.
	   Serb authorities have acknowledged that they had killed dozens
of ethnic Albanians in one grisly recent battle and then buried the
unclaimed bodies at a garbage dump.
	   However, they angrily called media reports about mass graves a
lie and said all the dead were ethnic Albanian ``terrorists.''
	   European Union monitors who visited the site at Orahovac, 30
miles (50 kilometers) southwest of Pristina, said Wednesday they
found no evidence of mass graves.
	   But a furor continued over recent attacks that have emptied
whole villages and killed civilians as well as the KLA fighters.
	   ``Serb forces attack and kill unprotected people, systematically
destroy and burn property of Albanians, which leads to the
displacement of tens of thousands of Albanians,'' ethnic Albanian
leader Ibrahim Rugova said.
	   While international aid agencies were continuing efforts to
provide help to the refugees, no military intervention appeared
likely soon.
	   Despite NATO's longstanding threat to step in, officials at the
Western military alliance's headquarters said this week that no
military action was planned at this stage.
	   Even Washington appeared to ease its position on intervention,
according to German opposition candidate Gerhard Schroeder, who met
with President Bill Clinton on Wednesday.
	   ``We agreed that an intervention _ if that were to happen at all
_ can and should only happen under the umbrella of the United
Nations Security Council,'' Schroeder said.
	   That would be a change of position for the United States.
Defense Secretary William Cohen has said NATO doesn't need
permission from the United Nations if it decides to use force in
Kosovo.
	   Also Thursday, the European Union approved 5 million European
currency units (dlrs 5.5 million) in aid for Kosovo. The EU
Commission said the funds will enable the United Nations and
humanitarian groups to take urgent steps to help people fleeing the
fighting.

Three Japanese share first-round lead
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   KATO, Japan (AP) _ Yuka Irie, Kozue Azuma and Chikako Matsuzawa
shot 3-under-par 69s Thursday and shared a one-stroke first-round
lead in the 60 million yen (dlrs 414,000) Mizuno Ladies Golf
Tournament.
	   A thunderstorm interrupted play for more than 90 minutes.
	   Irie, a 29-year-old pro whose last LPGA tour victory came at the
Chiyoda Ladies in 1995, shot seven birdies and four bogeys on the
6,480-yard, par-72 Asahi Kokusai Tojo Country Club Tojo course.
	   Azuma had five birdies and two bogeys, and Matsuzawa one eagle,
four birdies and three bogeys.
	   One stroke behind were Aki Nakano, who won the Sumitomo Visa
Taiheiyo Club Ladies last week, and five other Japanese _ Hiromi
Takamura, Yuko Motoyama, Kyoko Ono, Nobuko Kizawa and Chieko
Amanuma.
	   Taiwanese golfers Tseng Hsiu-feng, Huang Yueh-chyn and Tai
Yu-chung were in a 15th-place tie with eight Japanese at 72.
	   Defending champion Aiko Takasu shot a 79 and stood 110th in the
field of 132.
	   The winner will receive 10.8 million yen (dlrs 74,000).

Beatles lyrics notebook up for sale
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ A notebook containing draft Beatles lyrics for
``Hey Jude'' and ``Sergeant Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band'' and
doodles by John Lennon will be auctioned on Sept. 15.
	   The spiral-bound book will be sold as part of a Sotheby's sale
of rock 'n' roll memorabilia at the Hard Rock Cafe. Sotheby's
expects it to fetch between 90,000 and 120,000 pounds (dlrs 147,000
and 196,000).
	   Filled with scribbles and brightly colored ink, the notebook
dates from an 18 month period between 1967-68, when the Beatles
were at the top of the charts releasing albums such as ``Sergeant
Pepper'' and ``The Beatles'' _ more commonly known as the White
Album.
	   The group's road manager, Mal Evans, compiled it. He was killed
in a by police in Los Angeles in 1976 after brandishing an
imitation gun.
	   Evans included a draft of ``Being for the Benefit of Mr. Kite''
with half a line added by Lennon and George Harrison's recording
notes for ``All You Need Is Love.'' The notebook begins with what
seems to be a checklist about the filming of promotional clips for
the ``Strawberry Fields Forever'' single.
	   ``Lyrics are easily the most collectable items for all
collectors,'' said Stephen Maycock, Sotheby's rock and pop
specialist. ``Three years ago the lyrics for The Beatles' `Getting
Better' reached 161,000 pounds (dlrs 262,000) at auction which was
a new record.''
	   Maycock said the notebook had come from ``anonymous vendor''
associated with Sotheby's for the last 30 years.

Peace talks with Philippine Muslim rebel group to resume Aug. 18
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   COTABATO, Philippines (AP) _ Peace talks between the Philippine
government and a Muslim rebel group will resume Aug. 18 after a
half-year suspension, the chief government negotiator said.
	   Retired Lt. Gen. Orlando Soriano said the talks in southern
Cotabato City will be the first meeting between the Moro Islamic
Liberation Front and a panel of government negotiators formed by
President Joseph Estrada's new administration.
	   The peace talks were suspended early in the year because of
campaigning for May national elections in which Estrada replaced
former President Fidel Ramos.
	   ``We are not only opening the door toward peace, but we are
opening it wider so that we can accommodate more thoughts toward
the attainment of peace,'' Soriano said Wednesday.
	   Presidential adviser Manuel Yan said Estrada is ``focusing his
utmost attention on this peace process.''
	   Soriano said no substantive issues are to be discussed at the
first meeting but the parameters of the talks will be set.
	   The MILF, which has been holding peace talks with the government
since last year, is the bigger of two Muslim groups still fighting
the government. The largest Muslim rebel group, the Moro National
Liberation Front, signed a peace pact in 1996.
	   Estrada has said he wants to conclude the peace talks in 18
months.

	   Smith escaped the maximum punishment _ a life ban.
	   But a four-year suspension, if upheld, would effectively end her
career. She is 28 and would miss the 2000 Sydney Olypmpics and the
next world championships.
	   Smith was charged with manipulating an out-of-competition drug
test on Jan. 10 by adulterating her urine sample with alcohol.
	   In April, FINA announced that Smith's samples, tested at the
IOC-accredited laboratory in Barcelona, Spain, showed ``unequivocal
signs of adulteration'' and ``physical manipulation.''
	   Both samples allegedly contained a lethal concentration of
whiskey, suggesting an attempt to mask the detection of drugs.
	   Under FINA rules, tampering with a urine sample is considered as
serious as taking steroids.

Two companies of Indonesian troops arrive in troubled East Timor
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   DILI, Indonesia (AP) _ After withdrawing hundreds of combat
troops from East Timor, Indonesia's military said Thursday it had
sent 263 army health personnel and police to the troubled
territory.
	   The local military chief, Col. Tono Suratman, said the newcomers
would help the former Portuguese colony in its development.
	   At a welcoming ceremony, he said the troops _ one company each
of the army and police _ would not engage in combat or intelligence
operations.
	   The troops, including 155 army officers with specialties in
health and mental counseling, arrived Wednesday night aboard a navy
ship. The remaining 108 are from a police special mobile brigade.
	   Their arrival came hours after the departure of 300 troops, the
second batch in a total of 1,000 Indonesian soldiers being
withdrawn from East Timor.
	   On July 28, 400 combat troops left East Timor on a ship after
Indonesian President B.J. Habibie pledged to reduce the presence of
the military, which has been accused of widespread human rights
abuses.
	   The withdrawal of the 1,000 combat troops is expected to be
completed on Saturday, leaving 11,000 soldiers in place.
	   On Wednesday in New York, Indonesia and Portugal agreed to
discuss an Indonesian proposal to bring peace to East Timor by
granting it a form of autonomy.
	   Indonesia annexed East Timor in 1976, a year after its troops
intervened in a civil war that broke out during the last days of
Portuguese colonial rule.
	   The United Nations, however, still considers Portugal the
administering power in the half-island territory.

 &UR; Eds: UPDATES in graf 11 with government threatening to cut
financing to mining regions involved in protests. &QL;

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Striking ambulance workers in the eastern port
city of Vladivostok have turned down 186 calls for help since their
protest began earlier this week, news reports said Thursday.
	   There are usually 30 ambulance teams on duty, but only four are
currently on the job. They are responding only to life-threatening
situations, calls involving children under age 2, and pregnant
women going into labor, the ITAR-Tass and Interfax news agencies
reported.
	   Other patients are either referred to outpatient clinics or
consulted over the telephone, the reports said.
	   The ambulance workers are demanding four months worth of unpaid
wages.
	   Meanwhile, the Vladivostok prosecutor's office has opened a
criminal investigation into the failure to the local government to
finance the ambulance service, and has urged striking workers to
return to the job while the investigation continues, Interfax
reported. But the strikers continue to remain off the job.
	   Meanwhile, on the eastern island of Sakhalin, striking miners
allowed a limited coal delivery to reach a key power plant, after a
nearly two-week blockade.
	   The miners, who are demanding eight months worth of unpaid
wages, negotiated a truce Tuesday, agreeing to allow enough coal
through to keep the plant running. But some protesters refused to
leave the tracks for another day.
	   Late Wednesday night, the first delivery of some 1,500 tons of
coal loaded on 25 rail cars was allowed to go through, ITAR-Tass
reported.
	   Local authorities have accused the miners of causing serious
economic damage to the remote island because they have interrupted
preparations for winter, ITAR-Tass said.
	   Sakhalin, with a population of 650,000, is dependent on the
plant because it is not hooked up to Russia's national power grid.
Authorities have been rationing electricity, amid fears that the
plant would soon run out of fuel if coal deliveries did not arrive.
	   On Thursday, Deputy Prime Minister Boris Nemtsov announced that
the government will stop financing mining regions where unpaid
workers block railroads, ITAR-Tass and Interfax reported.
	   On the eastern Kamchatka peninsula, about 100 municipal workers
blocked a key highway used for transporting salmon caught off
Kamchatka's west coast, Interfax said. More than 30 trucks loaded
with fish have been stalled on the road by Thursday evening, it
said.
	   Protests over back wages have swept over Russia in recent
months. But the protests have rarely been coordinated, and workers'
pay is still arriving months late.
	   Millions of Russian workers receive their salaries months late
due to a chronic cycle of non-payments that has plagued the country
for years.

	   FINA said Thursday that its investigation found that the urine
was ``manipulated by the swimmer'' but ``the way of manipulation is
uncertain.''
	   FINA said it found that the manipulation was not carried out in
the laboratory, during the transport or by the collectors of the
sample.
	   The statement said Smith was banned under two rules _ one
covering a ``a competitor (who) uses or takes advantage of a banned
procedure'' and the other for ``use of substances and methods which
alter the integrity and validity of urine samples used in doping
control.''
	   Smith, who says she has been tested more often than any other
international swimmer, underwent the out-of-season urine test in
Kilkenny County, Ireland, on Jan. 10.
	   Smith has been surrounded by allegations and rumors of drug use
ever since she won three gold medals in Atlanta. She has
consistently denied taking performance-enhancing drugs.

Russian gas company presses Belarus to pay bills

<TEXT>
	   MINSK, Belarus (AP) _ The head of Russia's Gazprom gas monopoly
met with Belarusian President Alexander Lukashenko and other top
officials on Thursday to press for payment of Belarus' huge
outstanding gas debt.
	   Belarus owes Gazprom dlrs 250 million, Belarusian Prime Minister
Sergei Ling said.
	   Gazprom has repeatedly pressed Belarus to pay up, and in April
agreed to let the former Soviet republic pay 26 percent of the debt
in cash and the rest in goods and services. But little has changed.
	   After a two-hour meeting with Lukashenko on Thursday, Gazprom
chairman Rem Vyakhirev said the two ``have in principle agreed'' on
ways to restructure the debt, but refused to provide details.

Ashrawi quits government, citing corruption, poor peace policy
</HEADLINE>

 &UR; AP Photos
 &UR; By SAMAR ASSAD &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   RAMALLAH, West Bank (AP) _ Hanan Ashrawi, one of the best-known
Palestinian political figures, quit her Cabinet job Thursday to
protest corruption and what she called mishandling of peace
efforts.
	   During Israeli-Palestinian peace negotiations in the early
1990s, Ashrawi gained a worldwide reputation as an articulate
spokeswoman for the Palestinian cause. She is also a well-known
human-rights and women's-rights activist.
	   Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat announced a new Cabinet on
Wednesday, a year after legislators demanded the old one be
dissolved because of widespread corruption. But all of the
ministers accused of corruption kept their jobs.
	   Ashrawi, who had been minister of higher education since 1996,
said she declined to accept a new appointment as tourism minister
because ``I believe that comprehensive reform was not addressed in
this new government formulation.''
	   ``I assured President Arafat that once he conducts ...genuine
reform, I will be willing to help him,'' Ashrawi told reporters in
the West Bank town of Ramallah.
	   A second minister also announced he was quitting to protest
Arafat's failure to crack down on corruption. Abdel Jawad Saleh, an
Arafat critic who previously served as minister of agriculture,
called the new Cabinet a ``tragedy.''
	   Saleh said when he tried to fight corruption in his ministry,
Arafat stepped in and shielded high-ranking officials.
	   Ashrawi also said she was unhappy with the handling of the
Palestinian leadership's handling of peace talks, and was sharply
critical of the United States for what she said was a pro-Israeli
bias.
	   ``Rather than facing up to its helplessness and powerlessness
befor Israel, the American adminstration is putting pressure on the
Palestinians,'' she said.
	   Peace talks have been stalled for the past 16 months. The two
sides have been holding high-level talks to try to restart them,
but so far have not reached any accord.

 &UR; Michelle Smith banned for four years
 &UR; Eds: Combines previous

<TEXT>
	   LAUSANNE, Switzerland (AP) _ Irish swimmer Michelle Smith,
winner of three gold medals at the 1996 Atlanta Olympics, was
bannned for four years Thursday for allegedly tampering with a
urine sample.
	   The decision was announced by the international swimming
federation (FINA), 13 days after a hearing by its doping panel on
July 24.
	   The suspension goes into effect immediately, FINA said.
	   Smith's lawyer, Peter Lennon, was not immediately available for
comment.
	   But Lennon has previously said he would appeal to a higher court
if Smith was found guilty.
	   Smith escaped the maximum punishment _ a life ban.
	   But a four-year suspension, if upheld, would effectively end her
career. She is 28 and would miss the 2000 Sydney Olympics and the
next world championships.
	   Smith was charged with manipulating an out-of-competition drug
test on Jan. 10 by adulterating her urine sample with alcohol.
	   In April, FINA announced that Smith's samples, tested at the
IOC-accredited laboratory in Barcelona, Spain, showed ``unequivocal
signs of adulteration'' and ``physical manipulation.''
	   Both samples allegedly contained a lethal concentration of
whiskey, suggesting an attempt to mask the presence of banned
drugs.
	   Under FINA rules, tampering with a urine sample is considered as
serious as taking steroids.
	   FINA said Thursday that its investigation found that the urine
was ``manipulated by the swimmer'' but ``the way of manipulation is
uncertain.''
	   FINA said it found that the manipulation was not carried out in
the laboratory, during the transport or by the collectors of the
sample.
	   The statement said Smith was banned under two rules _ one
covering a ``a competitor (who) uses or takes advantage of a banned
procedure'' and the other for ``use of substances and methods which
alter the integrity and validity of urine samples used in doping
control.''
	   Smith, who says she has been tested more often than any other
international swimmer, underwent the out-of-season urine test in
Kilkenny County, Ireland, on Jan. 10.
	   Smith has been surrounded by allegations and rumors of drug use
ever since she won three gold medals in Atlanta. She has
consistently denied taking performance-enhancing drugs.

Horta rules out Timor talks until Gusmao freed
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with comment from Australian foreign minister &QL; 
 &UR; With BC-UN-East Timor &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   CANBERRA, Australia (AP) _ East Timorese independence leader
Jose Ramos Horta on Thursday ruled out further talks on the future
of the disputed region until jailed resistance leader Xanana Gusmao
is freed by Indonesia.
	   The Nobel Peace Prize laureate welcomed a deal between Portugal
and Indonesia to open talks on autonomy for the former Portuguese
colony, annexed by Indonesia after a 1975 invasion.
	   Australia is the only country that recognizes Indonesian
sovereignty over East Timor.
	   But Horta said he would take no part in negotiations until
Gusmao was released.
	   ``They cannot pretend they are serious, that they want to solve
the problem of East Timor and then do not wish to release Xanana
Gusmao,'' Horta told Australian Broadcasting Corp. radio.
	   ``Xanana is the only political leader with real acceptance and
credibility among the people of East Timor.''
	   Horta said he was no longer prepared to be Gusmao's proxy.
	   ``I will not continue to engage in dialogue myself with
Indonesia while Xanana remains in prison,'' he said.
	   ``They have to talk to him and to talk to him they have to
release him from prison.
	   ``It would be unfair and unworkable if Xanana is not released
... because any decision without his involvement, his imprimatur _
it will be rejected by the people of East Timor.''
	   Australian Foreign Minister Alexander Downer refused to back
Horta's call for Indonesia to release Gusmao and said demands for a
referendum on independence were irresponsible and could lead to
further bloodshed in the territory.
	   Downer welcomed the talks, but said Thursday he would not
intervene to back Gusmao's release.
	   ``I'm not getting into trying to micro-manage this,'' Downer
said.
	   ``Horta is one important figure in all of this, there are a lot
of other figures.
	   ``We've been consulting over the last few weeks with a wide
range of different leaders of what you might broadly describe as
the East Timorese community, although a lot of them are overseas.
	   ``There is a diversity of views. ... Neither today or any other
day am I going to come out and start backing one particular course
of action or another.''
	   Downer said Australia was willing to facilitate further talks,
which must be all inclusive and involve the people of East Timor.
	   He agreed the most likely short-term option for the colony was
wide-ranging autonomy.
	   ``If you just had a referendum in East Timor you would leave the
losers of that referendum completely alienated,'' he said. ``And
there would be a risk ... that the result would only lead to
renewed fighting and civil war in East Timor.''

Second doping trial in Germany opens this month
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BERLIN (AP) _ The second trial of former East German coaches and
doctors charged with harming swimmers by secretly giving them
anabolic steroids opens later this month, the state court in Berlin
announced Thursday.
	   The three coaches and two doctors go on trial Aug. 18 on charges
of causing bodily harm to young female swimmers on East Germany's
TSC Berlin team from 1978 to 1989.
	   The first trial to deal with East Germany's doping practices
opened in March. The ongoing trial deals with swimmers on the
former communist nation's showcase Dynamo Berlin team.
	   Of the four coaches and two doctors who are defendants in that
case, only one has admitted administering doses of anabolic
steroids.
	   But sports doctor Dieter Binus insisted in court testimony that
the doses were too small to cause physical harm and that none of
his athletes showed ill effects.

	   KABUL, Afghanistan (AP) _ Nearly 100 Taliban soldiers have died
in the last 24 hours battling an opposition alliance in northern
Afghanistan, a spokesman for the alliance said Thursday.
	   Taliban spokesman Abdul Hay Muttayn said he could not
immediately confirm the reports which also said the Taliban were
losing ground.
	   Anti-Taliban spokesman Abdullah, who uses only one name, said
his forces recaptured territory from the Taliban near the key
northern city of Mazar-e-Sharif in heavy fighting, repelled a
Taliban attack in the region, and captured the strategic town of
Borka to the south. He did not mention alliance casualties.
	   The capture of Borka, 200 kilometers (120 miles) southeast of
Mazar-e-Sharif, would relieve pressure on anti-Taliban leader Ahmed
Shah Masood's stronghold in the Panjshir Valley just north of the
Afghan capital of Kabul. Abdullah, speaking by telephone from
London, said the attack on Borka was ``very massive.''
	   Abdullah added that top alliance military commanders met for a
strategy session Wednesday in Hayratan, about 60 kilometers (40
miles) east of Mazar-e-Sharif. The sometimes fractious
northern-based alliance is closing ranks to defend Mazar-e-Sharif,
the only city outside Taliban control. The Taliban hold almost all
of Afghanistan, including Kabul.
	   Earlier Thursday, a rocket hit the perimeter of Kabul's airport
after a night of heavy fighting north of the Afghan capital that
injured two civilians. No casualties or damage was reported in the
rocket attack.
	   In a statement Thursday, the Taliban Foreign Ministry pledged to
fight the alliance, rejecting calls for peace.
	   Russia and Uzbekistan on Wednesday urged all sides in the Afghan
conflict to find a peaceful solution. The United Nations' Security
Council also expressed concern Wednesday over the ``dangerous
escalation of the armed conflict'' and called for peace talks in
Afghanistan.
	   The Taliban have imposed a strict version of Islamic law in
areas they control. Most women are barred from work and most girls
from school, music is banned, men are required to wear beards and
public mutilation of thieves is common.
	   Taliban said their advance was not a threat to neighboring
countries. Russia has long been fearful the Taliban's strict brand
of Islam would spread to neighbors like Uzbekistan and other former
central Asian regions of the Soviet Union.
	   Taliban fighters are poised to attack Mazar-e-Sharif, about 300
kilometers (about 180 miles) north of Kabul, but have not said when
they would strike. The fighters are reportedly gathered on two
sides, with the front lines about 20 kilometers (12 miles) to the
west and 40 kilometers (25 miles) to the east.
	   Last May, the Taliban retreated from Mazar-e-Sharif after street
battles in which hundreds of Taliban soldiers died. As many as
2,000 Taliban prisoners of war reportedly were later massacred.

Officials investigating whether Albanians in Germany are arming
</HEADLINE>
militants &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   BONN, Germany (AP) _ Security officials investigating Albanian
groups in Germany to determine whether their donations are helping
arm Albanian militants said Friday they have been unable to trace
the flow of funds from Germany.
	   The six-nation Contact Group that oversees the Balkans last
month called on nations with substantial populations of Albanians
from Yugoslavia's Kosovo region to crack down on the flow of funds
to rebels trying to establish an independent Albanian state.
	   Kosovo Albanians who work in Germany traditionally donate 3
percent of their income to the ethnic Albanians' self-styled
government in the Yugoslavian province of Kosovo, where they
comprise 90 percent of the population.
	   Klaus-Dieter Fritsche, deputy head of Germany's constitutional
protection agency which monitors extremist groups, said it is
virtually impossible to determine whether money sent to Kosovo from
Germany pays for arms.
	   The tradition dates from before this year's clashes between
separatists there and Yugoslav forces.
	   Kurt Schelter, an Interior Ministry official, said the
government was trying to determine whether Kosovo Albanian
associations are violating any German rules regarding non-profit
status, and that it would speak with Kosovo Albanian
representatives to stress that it won't tolerate money being sent
to arm militants.
	   There are no firm estimates of how much money is sent from
Germany to Kosovo. But Germany's population of about 100,000
Albanians and ethnic Albanians from Kosovo is one of the largest in
Europe, and is believed to be a source of funds for the rebels.

	   YEREVAN, Armenia (AP) _ Armenia's prosecutor general was killed
in his office Thursday, apparently by a former prosecutor who then
committed suicide, a top law enforcement official said.
	   Genrikh Khachatrian was slain late Thursday afternoon, shortly
after leaving a government meeting in the capital and promising to
return a short time later.
	   A high-ranking Interior Ministry official, speaking on condition

a former prosecutor, Aram Karapetian, who then committed suicide in
the same office.

Outcry over withholding of funds from Holocaust survivors
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By JACK KATZENELL &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ A public outcry erupted Thursday in Israel over
the disclosure that government bureaucrats had withheld German
reparation funds that could be used to improve the lot of hundreds
of Holocaust survivors in mental hospitals.
	   Millions of dollars in reparations are sitting in the patients'
bank accounts, but officials have failed to approve the funds' use
to alleviate bleak living conditions for the elderly survivors.
	   The controversy came to light when doctors at Abarbanel hospital
near Tel Aviv said government trustees had refused to allow the
money to be spent on quality-of-life measures for the patients,
such as televisions, air conditioners and holiday parties.
	   Israel's chief rabbi, Meir Lau _ himself a Holocaust survivor _
called the allegations shocking. He said he planned to visit the
patients and try to ease their plight.
	   ``I think the power of every moral society depends on its
approach to the weakest, and our weakest are Holocaust survivors
who are not healthy in mind and spirit,'' he said.
	   Avraham Hirschson, head of a parliamentary committee dealing
with reparations to Holocaust survivors, asked Speaker Dan Tichon
to recall lawmakers from their summer recess for an emergency
debate on the ``the disgraceful exploitation of Holocaust
survivors' funds.''
	   Avner Shalev, chairman of Yad Vashem, Israel's Holocaust
memorial and museum, said he was ``simply astounded by the
insensitivity and the malice'' of the officials involved.
	   He proposed that control of the funds be transferred to a body
``with the sensitivity needed to work with Holocaust survivors.''
	   About 900 of the 360,000 Holocaust survivors who live in Israel
are believed to be in mental hospitals.
	   Most have been institutionalized since they came to Israel in
the 1940s and '50s and were unable to adjust to life in a new
Jewish state that wanted to look to the future rather than remember
past sufferings.
	   The survivors, many in their 80s, suffer from illnesses that
include acute depression and schizophrenia, which are attributed to
their experiences in the Nazi death camps. Due to their mental
illnesses, these survivors were made wards of the state.
	   Some have accumulated large sums of money in reparations from
the German government, receiving as much as several hundred dollars
a month for the past four decades. The Maariv newspaper estimated
that altogether the patients have several million dollars.

Cambodian leader Hun Sen warns of political crisis

<TEXT>
	   PHNOM PENH, Cambodia (AP) _ Co-Prime Minister Hun Sen warned
Thursday that Cambodia could face a new political crisis as
opposition parties stepped up their attacks on the legitimacy of
last week's parliamentary election.
	   Hun Sen's Cambodian People's Party emerged as the winner of the
July 26 election when long-delayed complete preliminary results
were announced Wednesday.
	   Pending recounts of some votes, Hun Sen's party appeared to have
won a slight majority in the 122-seat National Assembly, but not
the two-thirds majority needed to form a government on its own.
	   The main opposition parties are alleging there was rampant fraud
in voting and ballot-counting. On Thursday, they also complained
about the formula the National Election Committee will use to
allocate parliamentary seats to the winners.
	   They have threatened to block the formation of a new government
by boycotting the new National Assembly session if their complaints
are not properly investigated.
	   ``If the two parties boycott, this will cause a crisis ...
because the old National Assembly will be dissolved,'' Hun Sen said
in an interview with Radio Australia's Khmer-language service. ``If
that really happens, the situation will look very bad. There will
be a constitutional crisis.''
	   He said he might try to convene a session of the outgoing
National Assembly to amend the constitution so that just 50 percent
plus one member of parliament would be needed to be confirm a new
government, rather than the two-thirds majority now necessary.
	   Prince Norodom Ranariddh, leader of the opposition FUNCINPEC
party, and his ally Sam Rainsy issued a statement describing as
``illegal'' the little-noticed change in the formula for allocating
parliamentary seats made before the election.
	   The change favors the party winning the most votes in any
particular province. In practice, it worked to the advantage of the
ruling party, which under the original formula would have won 59
seats, less than a majority.
	   Under the new formula, the CPP is slated to take 64
parliamentary seats, FUNCINPEC 43 and the Sam Rainsy Party 15.
	   The election committee has insisted the formula change was legal
and aboveboard, but so far has not been able to explain the reason
for doing it.
	   The Cambodian People's Party said Thursday its victory ``is not
a victory exclusively for the CPP but is also of the entire nation,
which is on its path of liberal democracy.''
	   It promised to work hard for economic and social development.
	   A coalition with other parties that won seats in the elections
is the ``best way to guarantee national stability and to build
trust among the Cambodian people toward the government,'' it said
in a statement broadcast on a television station it controls.
	   However, Hun Sen said in his interview, which was rebroadcast on
Cambodian radio, that it might be better not to have the Sam Rainsy
Party in government, so it could provide a strong parliamentary
opposition.
	   The election came one year after Hun Sen ousted Ranariddh as his
co-prime minister in a violent coup, shattering a tense dual
premiership formed after U.N.-sponsored polls in 1993.
	   Hun Sen hoped that new election would restore his legitimacy in
the eyes of the international community and foreign aid lost after
his takeover.

Michelle Smith banned for four years
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with further details, background, minor editing &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   LAUSANNE, Switzerland (AP) _ Irish swimmer Michelle Smith,
winner of three gold medals at the 1996 Atlanta Olympics, was
bannned for four years Thursday after the sport's governing body
determined she tampered with a urine sample.
	   The decision was announced by the international swimming
federation (FINA), 13 days after a hearing by its doping panel.
	   The suspension goes into effect immediately, FINA said.
	   Smith's lawyer, Peter Lennon, was not immediately available for
comment. But Lennon has previously said he would appeal to a higher
court if Smith was found guilty.
	   Smith escaped FINA's maximum punishment _ a life ban.
	   But a four-year suspension, if upheld, would effectively end her
career. She is 28 and would miss the 2000 Sydney Olympics and the
next world championships in 2001 in Fukuoka, Japan.
	   Smith was charged with manipulating an out-of-competition drug
test in January by adulterating her urine sample with alcohol.
	   In April, FINA announced that Smith's samples, tested at the
IOC-accredited laboratory in Barcelona, Spain, showed ``unequivocal
signs of adulteration'' and ``physical manipulation.''
	   Both samples allegedly contained a lethal concentration of
whiskey, suggesting an attempt to mask the presence of banned
drugs.
	   Under FINA rules, tampering with a urine sample is considered as
serious as taking steroids.
	   FINA said Thursday that its investigation found that the urine
was ``manipulated by the swimmer'' but ``the way of manipulation is
uncertain.''
	   FINA said it found that the manipulation was not carried out in
the laboratory, during the transport or by the collectors of the
sample.
	   The statement said Smith was banned under two rules _ one
covering a ``a competitor (who) uses or takes advantage of a banned
procedure'' and the other for ``use of substances and methods which
alter the integrity and validity of urine samples used in doping
control.''
	   Smith, who says she has been tested more often than any other
international swimmer, underwent the out-of-season urine test in
Kilkenny County, Ireland, on Jan. 10.
	   Smith and her lawyer appeared at the FINA hearing in Lausanne on
July 24. FINA's statement said she ``stressed the fact that no
banned substance has been detected in her urine'' and she stated
that ``from her side there was no physical manipulation of the
sample.''
	   Smith has persistently denied taking performance-enhancing
drugs. Her coach and husband is former Dutch discus throwner Eric
De Bruin, who served a four-year ban in track and field after
testing positive for high levels of testosterone.
	   Smith has been surrounded by allegations and rumors of drug use
ever since she won gold medals in Atlanta in the 400 freestyle, 200
individual medley and 400 individual medley. She also won
	   In her last major competition, Smith won two gold medals (400
individual medley and 200 freestyle) at the 1997 European
Championships in Seville, Spain.
	   Smith missed this year's world championships in Perth,
Australia, citing injuries.

Malaysia to continue overseas fund-raising efforts
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia (AP) _ Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad
said Thursday Malaysia will push ahead with stalled plans to raise
money overseas despite what he called foreign attempts to undermine
the country's economy.
	   Mahathir said the government would not publicize its
fund-raising efforts to keep ``rogue currency speculators'' from
sabotaging the plans.
	   ``We will find other means (to borrow) but we cannot reveal them
because then the rogue currency speculators will find ways to
derail our efforts,'' Mahathir was quoted as saying by the
government news agency Bernama.
	   Last week, Moody's and Standard and Poor's downgraded Malaysia's
sovereign debt ratings, forcing Finance Minister Anwar Ibrahim to
postpone a planned trip to drum up support for a dlrs 2 billion
government bond issue. The funds were intended to help debt-ridden
banks recover.
	   ``They deliberately undermined our efforts to revive our own
economy,'' Mahathir said.
	   Repeating his accusations that currency speculators were mainly
to blame for the region's economic crisis, Mahathir said they now
were attacking Malaysia's ability to raise foreign loans.
	   ``The people don't know this but this is the very thing that we
in the National Economic Action Council are constantly
discussing,'' Mahathir said.
	   The council was set up by the government to find solutions for
Malaysia's economic crisis.
	   Mahathir said currency speculators not only wanted to control
the economies of countries in Asia, but also the politics and
leaders.
	   Leaders in Thailand, Indonesia, South Korea and Japan have all
been ousted, he said.
	   ``Those (who) have not been changed are in Singapore and
Malaysia,'' Mahathir said.

Volkswagen invests in German plant
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   FRANKFURT, Germany (AP) - Volkswagen announced Thursday plans to
invest 20 million marks (dlrs 11 million) in a plant in the Saxony
town of Mosel.
	   The auto manufacturer will construct a new production facility
on the site, said Gunter Sandmann, a Volkswagen AG spokesman. New
jobs will not be created initially.
	   Both the Golf and Passat models will be specially outfitted at
the renovated plant with right-side steering for the Japanese,
British, and Australian markets. The renovated plant will ease the
burden at other Volkswagen factories.
	   Work on the 8,000-square-meter (86,000-square-foot) facility
begins in September. It should be completed by early 1999.

Kinkel urges EU police agency to fight Internet child porn
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   THE HAGUE, Netherlands (AP) _ Germany's foreign minister called
Thursday on the European police agency to play a bigger role in the
fight against child pornography and its distribution on the
Internet.
	   ``It is one of the ugliest crimes ... It has got a new dimension
because of the Internet,'' said Foreign Minister Klaus Kinkel after
visiting Europol headquarters in The Hague.
	   During his half-day visit, Kinkel got a closer look at Europol's
operations, which focus on cross-border trafficking of illicit
drugs and nuclear materials as well as illegal immigration, stolen
vehicles and money laundering.
	   Child pornography, especially its dissemination in cyberspace,
is not included in Europol's mandate except when it is linked to
child smuggling. The agency also has limited capabilities to police
the circulation of these materials.
	   But Kinkel said Europol should do more to stop criminals from
spreading child pornography on the Internet.
	   The foreign minister's visit followed weeks of commotion in the
Netherlands, Germany and Belgium over the discovery of a
Netherlands-based ring that trafficked pornography of children _
even infants _ around the world via the Internet.

Illegal migration, drug trafficking growing on Ukraine's borders
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   KIEV, Ukraine (AP) - As many as 11,000 border violators have
been detained in Ukraine in the first half of 1998, twice as many
as in the same period last year, officials said Thursday.
	   The figure included 5,000 illegal migrants from the Middle East,
African and Southeast Asian countries who tried to pass through
Ukraine on their way to Western Europe, said the country's border
guards commander, Lt. Gen. Pavlo Shysholin.
	   Shysholin said the number of drug trafficking cases has
increased about 60 times from 1997, when border guards seized 111
kilograms (244.2 pounds) of narcotics. So far this year, 6.2 metric
tons (6.8 short tons) have been seized, he said, according to the
ITAR-Tass news agency.
	   The government of the former Soviet republic recently has
adopted two resolutions aimed at strengthening the border regime
and introducing frontier zones along the country's international
borders, where foreigners would be restricted in their stay.

Unemployed of Beijing turn their noses up at sanitation work
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BEIJING (AP) _ Tens of thousands of Beijing residents may have
lost their jobs, but they're not about to lose respect in front of
the neighbors.
	   Not a single one of the capital's 80,000 unemployed applied for
jobs as garbage collectors or street cleaners during a recent
employment drive, despite salary offers that were three times
monthly unemployment payments, the official Xinhua News Agency
reported.
	   ``Excessive self-respect and sense of face'' stopped the
unemployed from accepting sanitation work, still considered
suitable only for the poor and uneducated, the report quoted an
official of the Municipal Labor Bureau as saying.
	   The closure and consolidation of inefficient state-owned
industries has thrown millions of people in China's cities out of
work in recent years. Workers who once could rely on dull but
secure jobs have been thrown into employment schemes ranging from
computer classes to rabbit raising.
	   But most still consider themselves above sanitation work, and 70
percent of Beijing's street cleaners are migrant workers from
outside Beijing, the report said.

Portugal braces for weekend increase in forest blazes
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   LISBON, Portugal (AP) _ Firefighters were getting the better of
dozens of forest blazes around Portugal on Thursday, but were
bracing themselves for additional weekend problems sparked by
arsonists, news reports said.
	   Thousands of firefighters around the country had managed to
control all but five of the fires Thursday, the Portuguese news
agency Lusa said. More than 60 blazes were reported active on
Wednesday.
	   The most worrying fire had been charring pine forest and
scrubland at Macao, about 150 kilometers (90 miles) northeast of
Lisbon, for over 24 hours, national television RTP said.
	   Forest fires are a regular feature of Portugal's hot and
sometimes windy summers, particularly in northern and central
areas. Authorities, however, believe many are caused by arsonists,
particularly at weekends.
	   ``The fires start at about 4 p.m. Friday and continue through to
Monday morning,'' the daily newspaper Jornal de Noticias quoted
firefighting chief Germano Martins as saying.
	   The National Police Institute is to carry out a psychological
study of the people in prison for starting fires, the paper said.
	   Devastation by forest fire in Portugal peaked in 1995 when
170,000 hectares (420,000 acres) were destroyed, over six times
more than last year.

Humanitarian Coordinator's spokesman said Thursday.
	   Iraqis have endured food rationing since shortly after the U.N.
Security Council imposed comprehensive sanctions against their
country following its invasion of Kuwait in 1990. The rations were
doled out by the government until the U.N. oil-for-food program
came on stream in the first half of 1997.
	   Under the program, which allows Iraq to sell limited amounts of
oil in order to buy food and humanitarian goods, the United Nations
approves the purchase of food supplies and supervises their
distribution.
	   ``A full food ration will be made available to the Iraqi
population in August, with all commodities supplied from Security
Council Resolution 986 funds,'' Eric Falt, the spokesman for the
Humanitarian Coordinator, said.
	   ``This is the first time this has occurred since August 1997,''
Falt said.
	   He said that previously ``delays in delivery by foreign
suppliers'' had reduced the quantities of food available.
	   Falt added that under the current phase of the oil-for-food
program, in which Iraq has been allowed to more than double its
sale of oil, shipments of food are expected to arrive in late
September.
	   ``This will include weaning cereals for infants and milk and
cheese for the rest of the population,'' he said.
	   Asked if the latest argument between the Iraqi government and
the U.N. disarmament commission could affect the food distribution
program, Falt told The Associated Press: ``We are encountering no
difficulties of any sort in our work.''

Michelle Smith banned for four years

<TEXT>
	   LAUSANNE, Switzerland (AP) _ Irish swimmer Michelle Smith,
winner of three gold medals at the 1996 Atlanta Olympics, was
banned for four years Thursday after the sport's governing body
determined she tampered with a urine sample.
	   The decision was announced by the international swimming
federation (FINA), 13 days after a hearing by its doping panel.
	   The suspension goes into effect immediately, FINA said.
	   Smith's lawyer, Peter Lennon, was not immediately available for
comment. But Lennon has previously said he would appeal to a higher
court if Smith was found guilty.
	   Smith escaped FINA's maximum punishment _ a life ban.
	   But a four-year suspension, if upheld, would effectively end her
career. She is 28 and would miss the 2000 Sydney Olympics and the
next world championships in 2001 in Fukuoka, Japan.
	   Smith was charged with manipulating an out-of-competition drug
test in January by adulterating her urine sample with alcohol.
	   In April, FINA announced that Smith's samples, tested at the
IOC-accredited laboratory in Barcelona, Spain, showed ``unequivocal
signs of adulteration'' and ``physical manipulation.''
	   Both samples allegedly contained a lethal concentration of
whiskey, suggesting an attempt to mask the presence of banned
drugs.
	   Under FINA rules, tampering with a urine sample is considered as
serious as taking steroids.
	   FINA said Thursday that its investigation found that the urine
was ``manipulated by the swimmer'' but ``the way of manipulation is
uncertain.''
	   FINA said it found that the manipulation was not carried out in
the laboratory, during the transport or by the collectors of the
sample.
	   The statement said Smith was banned under two rules _ one
covering a ``a competitor (who) uses or takes advantage of a banned
procedure'' and the other for ``use of substances and methods which
alter the integrity and validity of urine samples used in doping
control.''
	   Smith, who says she has been tested more often than any other
international swimmer, underwent the out-of-season urine test in
Kilkenny County, Ireland, on Jan. 10.
	   Smith and her lawyer appeared at the FINA hearing in Lausanne on
July 24. FINA's statement said she ``stressed the fact that no
banned substance has been detected in her urine'' and she stated
that ``from her side there was no physical manipulation of the
sample.''
	   Smith has persistently denied taking performance-enhancing
drugs. Her coach and husband is former Dutch discus throwner Eric
De Bruin, who served a four-year ban in track and field after
testing positive for high levels of testosterone.
	   Smith has been surrounded by allegations and rumors of drug use
ever since she won gold medals in Atlanta in the 400 freestyle, 200
individual medley and 400 individual medley. She also won a bronze
medal in the 200 butterfly.
	   In her last major competition, Smith won two gold medals (400
individual medley and 200 freestyle) at the 1997 European
Championships in Seville, Spain.
	   Smith missed this year's world championships in Perth,
Australia, citing injuries.

	   RAMALLAH, West Bank (AP) _ Hanan Ashrawi, a leading figure in
Palestinian politics, quit the government Thursday, criticizing
Yasser Arafat over corruption and handling of peace talks.
	   ``I will continue to serve and work as a (legislative) council
member, but not as a member of this government,'' she told a news
conference in the West Bank town of Ramallah.
	   Arafat announced a new Cabinet on Wednesday, a year after
legislators demanded the old one be dissolved because of widespread
corruption. But all of the ministers accused of corruption kept
their jobs.
	   Ashrawi, who had been minister of higher education since 1996,
said she declined to accept a new appointment as tourism minister
because ``I believe that comprehensive reform was not addressed in
this new government formulation.''
	   ``I assured Arafat that once he conducts ...genuine reform, I
will be willing to help him,'' said Ashrawi, who ran for the
legislature on an anti-corruption platform.
	   A second minister also announced he was quitting to protest
Arafat's failure to crack down on corruption. Abdel Jawad Saleh, an
Arafat critic who previously served as minister of agriculture,
called the new Cabinet a ``tragedy.''
	   Saleh said when he tried to fight corruption in his ministry,
Arafat stepped in and shielded high-ranking officials.
	   Ashrawi also, 6th graf pvs

<TEXT>
	   LIVERPOOL, England (AP) _ Photographs of rock icons and family
snapshots taken by the late wife of former Beatle Paul McCartney
will go on display for the first time Friday in McCartney's
hometown.
	   A shot of McCartney with the couple's daughter Mary, then a
baby, tucked in his jacket to keep warm is one of the 14 pictures
to be displayed. In another, Linda McCartney photographed her
husband's feet, complete with painted toenails, holding a glass.
	   Mrs. McCartney's photographs have never before been shown in
Liverpool, although she gave the prints in question _ part of a
collection of 150 photographs published in 1976 _ to the city's
Walker Art Gallery in 1978.
	   The exhibition, which runs until Sept. 6, also includes
photographs of rock stars David Bowie and Jimi Hendrix.
	   Exhibition organizer Peter Betts said he was sure the prints
would prove a hit with Beatle and art fans alike.
	   ``They are of historical significance and we also feel it is a
fitting tribute to Linda to show them,'' he said. ``With Liverpool
being Sir Paul's hometown, it seems appropriate that we should put
on a display and people will see just how good a photographer Linda
McCartney was.''

Illegal immigrants occupy Vatican mission in Paris
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   PARIS (AP) _ A group of illegal immigrants occupied the Vatican
mission in Paris for the fifth day Thursday, with little sign in
sight for a solution to the protest.
	   Police have erected waist-high barriers around the Papal Nuncio
in a fashionable neighborhood in western Paris, and a van of police
was parked in front of the building.
	   Inside five illegal immigrants from Africa and four French
people who support them continued their vigil to try to persuade
French authorities to grant the foreigners residency permits.
	   So-called ``sans papiers,'' which literally means ``without
papers'' in French frequently occupy churches to dramatize their
plight.
	   But the sit-in in the Papal Nuncio is one of the highest profile
protests so far by illegal immigrants.
	   The protesters say they are seeking papers for 17 people who
were part of a group of some 300 African illegal immigrants who
occupied the Saint Bernard church for two months in 1996.
	   Police stormed the church and expelled the group, but many since
then have become legal residents. The Saint Bernard group now
serves as a model for other illegal immigrants seeking to stay in
France.
	   The Vatican on Tuesday Tuesday called urged the immigrants
occupying its embassy to end their ``illegal action.'' The Vatican
stressed the need to obey French laws by immigrants seeking
residence permits.
	   Demonstrator Dugy Niakata, 32, said the protesters were prepared
to keep up their vigil. ``We need to wait until these sans papiers
are normalized,'' he said.
	   Niakata accused the leftist government of Socialist Prime
Minister Lionel Jospin of failing to keep its promise to help make
it easier for illegal immigrants to stay in France.
	   ``He (Jospin) didn't do what he said he would do,'' said
Niakata. If you promise something you need to do it.

 &UR; Latest confrontation with Iraq produces calmer Western reaction
 &UR; By EILEEN ALT POWELL &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   CAIRO, Egypt (AP) _ Last November, when Iraq expelled American
weapons inspectors on U.N. teams from Baghdad, the United States
responded swiftly by sending aircraft carriers and building up its
forces in the Gulf.
	   In the latest dispute, triggered by Iraqi leader Saddam
Hussein's announcement Wednesday that he would ``completely suspend
cooperation'' with U.N. weapons teams, the reaction from Washington
has been restrained.
	   ``At the end of the day, we will judge the situation on Iraqi
actions, not Iraqi words,'' said White House spokesman P.J.
Crowley.
	   Analysts in the Middle East believe that Saddam is betting it
will be harder for the United States to respond firmly to his
defiance of the United Nations this time.
	   Arab governments _ mindful of the deep public sympathy over the
plight of Iraq's 20 million people after eight years of U.N. trade
sanctions _ are as loath now as they were last winter to support
military strikes against Iraq.
	   And the near demise of the Middle East peace process, which most
Arabs blame on America's failure to pressure Israel, has not built
confidence that the United States is being even-handed in the
region.
	   Experts also cite President Clinton's deepening legal troubles
over allegations he had a sexual relationship with former White
House intern Monica Lewinsky and lied about it.
	   ``The president has to testify on Aug. 17, so he doesn't have
much time to deal with a crisis in Iraq,'' Abdel-Moneim Said Aly,
head of Cairo's Al-Ahram Center for Political and Strategic
Studies, told The Associated Press.
	   He added: ``That would suggest there's some interest in
postponing any confrontation for at least a couple of weeks.''
	   Washington could become more outspoken if the situation heats
up. But it did not get much support for threatened use of force in
last winter's crisis.
	   Among Arabs, even staunch ally Saudi Arabia refused to have its
territory used for an attack on Iraq. Of the U.N. Security
Council's five permanent members, only Britain joined in issuing
military threats against Baghdad.
	   The three other permanent members _ France, Russia and China _
reacted coolly to the idea and have since sought to ease sanctions
against Iraq.
	   The last crises ended on Feb. 23, when U.N. Secretary-General
Kofi Annan negotiated a deal in Baghdad in which Iraq promised to
cooperate with U.N. weapons teams and to open Saddam's palaces _ at
the center of the dispute _ to inspection.
	   Newspapers across the Arab world on Thursday again expressed
support for a political rather than military solution.
	   The English-language Egyptian Gazette, in an editorial titled
``Mere hiccup or brinkmanship?'' _ urged compromise to avoid a
showdown ``fueled by Washington's trigger happiness ... and the
growing pessimism inside Iraq over the prolonged crippling
sanctions.''
	   In Jordan, an editorial in the mass circulation Ad-Dustour urged
the international community ``to form a deterrent political and
moral force against the policies of warships'' and to push for
lifting the sanctions.

Haagen-Dazs invites Beijing's well-off to indulge
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; AP Photo &QL; 
 &UR; By ELAINE KURTENBACH &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   BEIJING (AP) _ With millions of Chinese being laid off from
state factories and the economy teetering toward recession, most
foreign retailers would be expected to look for ways to lure
bargain seekers.
	   Not Haagen-Dazs.
	   The gourmet ice cream maker has revamped the facade of Beijing's
stodgy old International Club in a splashy art deco style and set
up an ice cream parlor with polished granite table tops and elegant
French doors, where its confection sells for 25 yuan (dlrs 3.00) a
scoop.
	   While some foreign retailers are tapping downscale markets,
setting up discount warehouses and finding other ways to weather
hard times by catering to the frugal, Haagen-Dazs, a subsidiary of
U.S. food giant Pillsbury, is deliberately courting China's newly
rich.
	   ``What we are really selling is not just ice cream, but
pleasure,'' Pedro Man, Haagen-Dazs' vice president for Asia, said
at the store's opening Thursday.
	   Like some other upscale retailers, Haagen-Dazs is betting the
appetite of affluent Beijingers for luxury will lead them to dish
out more than double what they would pay elsewhere _ at shops
already considered expensive by local standards.
	   In the early decades after the communist state was founded in
1949, incomes were low but roughly equal. Only those with special
Communist Party status or connections managed to indulge in scarce
luxuries.
	   Economic reforms over the past 20 years have created a
substantial class of newly wealthy Chinese, with more than 5.3
million families boasting annual incomes of 50,000 yuan (U.S. dlrs
6,097) or more, according to a report Sunday in the newspaper
Beijing Daily.
	   That's a far cry from the average annual urban income of 4,839
yuan (dlrs 590), and worlds apart from the average 1,926 yuan (dlrs
234) earned by rural residents.
	   Private businessmen and managers make up the core of the newly
affluent. Others include teachers who tutor privately at home or
work as consultants, securities traders, entertainers or
advertising executives, the paper said.
	   The roughly 30 million Chinese considered to be well off are
only a small fraction of China's population of 1.2 billion. Heavily
concentrated in major cities like Beijing and Shanghai, however,
they represent a newly emerging market for all sorts of luxuries,
from designer fashions to fancy furniture.
	   China is counting on the desire of the well-to-do for better
housing and consumer goods to help keep an otherwise sluggish
economy growing.
	   Haagen-Dazs is counting on them, too. The Beijing store is the
company's third in China following two in Shanghai, part of a dlrs
40 million, 10-year campaign to break into the world's largest
potential market.
	   ``Our experience in Shanghai has been very positive,'' said Tony
King, the company's general manager for China. ``Our consumers
consider us an affordable luxury.''

Police arrest six men, seize large Yugoslav arms cache
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   ROTTERDAM, Netherlands (AP) _ Police in this port city Thursday
busted a ring they said was trafficking in weapons from the former
Yugoslavia, arresting six men and seizing a large cache of arms.
	   Hand grenades and other explosives were among the weapons
confiscated by police in a raid, Dutch television reported. Police
did not release the nationalities of the men involved.
	   It was the latest evidence of large-scale trafficking in western
Europe of surplus arms from the ex-Yugoslavia. Authorities say
grenades and small arms have been turning up in increasing numbers
since the war ended in 1995.
	   Two Moroccan-born schoolboys were killed instantly in April when
a grenade they found in an Amsterdam park exploded as they were
playing with it. Police said tests showed it bore the same markings
as those used in Bosnia's war.
	   Last December, someone fired two anti-tank grenades into an
Amsterdam car dealership, heavily damaging it. A police commando
unit concluded the grenades were Yugoslav-made.

Dienstbier urges governments to press for Kosovo settlement

<TEXT>
	   GENEVA (AP) _ A U.N. human rights expert on Thursday urged the
international community to put pressure on the Serb government and
Kosovo independence fighters to end the conflict in the troubled
Yugoslav province.
	   ``It seems there is no will for a political solution, so both
sides have to be pressured,'' Jiri Dienstbier, U.N. human rights
envoy to the former Yugoslavia, told reporters in Geneva.
	   Dienstbier, a Czech, said ``there must be ... a clear
understanding that the international community won't permit
another, larger catastrophe in the Balkans.''
	   He appeared to stop short of advocating immediate military
intervention to end the conflict. But he said any agreement reached
between the sides with the help or pressure of the international
community should be protected and guaranteed with military force if
necessary.
	   Dienstbier welcomed NATO's display of air power over Albania and
Macedonia in June, designed to persuade Yugoslav President Slobodan
Milosevic to curtail his military and police aggression.
	   He said he opposed economic sanctions because they ``only punish
ordinary people.''
	   Despite NATO's longstanding threat to step in, officials at NATO
headquarters this week ruled out military action at this stage.
	   Dienstbier, a former dissident and the first post-communist
foreign minister of Czechoslovakia, took over the position of U.N.
special investigator in the former Yugoslavia from Elizabeth Rehn
earlier this year. Rehn, an ex-Finnish defense minister, held the
post since 1995.
	   He visited the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia in April and says
he plans to visit the Balkan region again in the next few weeks.

 &UR; Latest confrontation with Iraq produces calmer Western reaction
 &UR; Eds: INSERTS comment from Jordan paper in 16th graf; RETRANSMITS to
include editor's note. &QL; 
 &UR; By EILEEN ALT POWELL &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   CAIRO, Egypt (AP) _ Last November, when Iraq expelled American
weapons inspectors on U.N. teams from Baghdad, the United States
responded swiftly by sending aircraft carriers and building up its
forces in the Gulf.
	   In the latest dispute, triggered by Iraqi leader Saddam
Hussein's announcement Wednesday that he would ``completely suspend
cooperation'' with U.N. weapons teams, the reaction from Washington
has been restrained.
	   ``At the end of the day, we will judge the situation on Iraqi
actions, not Iraqi words,'' said White House spokesman P.J.
Crowley.
	   Analysts in the Middle East believe that Saddam is betting it
will be harder for the United States to respond firmly to his
defiance of the United Nations this time.
	   Arab governments _ mindful of the deep public sympathy over the
plight of Iraq's 20 million people after eight years of U.N. trade
sanctions _ are as loath now as they were last winter to support
military strikes against Iraq.
	   And the near demise of the Middle East peace process, which most
Arabs blame on America's failure to pressure Israel, has not built
confidence that the United States is being even-handed in the
region.
	   Experts also cite President Clinton's deepening legal troubles
over allegations he had a sexual relationship with former White
House intern Monica Lewinsky and lied about it.
	   ``The president has to testify on Aug. 17, so he doesn't have
much time to deal with a crisis in Iraq,'' Abdel-Moneim Said Aly,
head of Cairo's Al-Ahram Center for Political and Strategic
Studies, told The Associated Press.
	   He added: ``That would suggest there's some interest in
postponing any confrontation for at least a couple of weeks.''
	   Washington could become more outspoken if the situation heats
up. But it did not get much support for threatened use of force in
last winter's crisis.
	   Among Arabs, even staunch ally Saudi Arabia refused to have its
territory used for an attack on Iraq. Of the U.N. Security
Council's five permanent members, only Britain joined in issuing
military threats against Baghdad.
	   The three other permanent members _ France, Russia and China _
reacted coolly to the idea and have since sought to ease sanctions
against Iraq.
	   The last crises ended on Feb. 23, when U.N. Secretary-General
Kofi Annan negotiated a deal in Baghdad in which Iraq promised to
cooperate with U.N. weapons teams and to open Saddam's palaces _ at
the center of the dispute _ to inspection.
	   Newspapers across the Arab world on Thursday again expressed
support for a political rather than military solution.
	   The English-language Egyptian Gazette, in an editorial titled
``Mere hiccup or brinkmanship?'' _ urged compromise to avoid a
showdown ``fueled by Washington's trigger happiness ... and the
growing pessimism inside Iraq over the prolonged crippling
sanctions.''
	   In Jordan, an editorial in the mass circulation Ad-Dustour urged
the international community ``to form a deterrent political and
moral force against the policies of warships'' and to push for
lifting the sanctions.

Amnesty urges anniversary release of Myanmar prisoners
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: EMBARGOED by source until 0001 GMT Aug. 7 &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) _ Amnesty International urged Myanmar's
military government Friday to free 10 political prisoners as a
human rights gesture on the 10th anniversary of nationwide
anti-government protests.
	   The London-based human rights group said the 10 individuals, one
of whom is 81, warranted special humanitarian consideration among
the estimated 1,200 political prisoners in Myanmar, also known as
Burma.
	   The appeal comes on the eve of the anniversary of Aug. 8, 1988,
when months of protests against military rule in the capital spread
nationwide. The army eventually quelled the demonstrations by
killing thousands of people.
	   ``Some of these men and women have spent almost 10 years in
prison for no more than writing letters and handing out leaflets,''
Amnesty International said in a statement. ``Why is the government
so afraid of them?''
	   Amnesty International said the release of prisoners would ``help
to defuse rising tensions, build public confidence and show a
degree of good faith to the international community.''
	   The anniversary comes two weeks before a deadline set by the
country's opposition leader, Nobel laureate Aung San Suu Kyi, for
the government to finally convene an overwhelmingly pro-democracy
parliament elected in 1990. It was never allowed to meet.
	   The military has ruled Myanmar, one of the world's poorest
countries, since 1962.
	   Amnesty International urged the present regime, dubbed the State
Peace and Development Council, to improve prison conditions, halt
unlawful killings, stop harassing opposition members, and stop
forced labor and forcible relocations of ethnic minorities.

Angry Bosnian Croat traders block Croat-Bosnia border
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   ZAGREB, Croatia (AP) _ Bosnian Croat traders, who export
agricultural goods to Croatia, barricaded the southwestern
Bosnian-Croat border with their trucks Thursday, demanding the
government in Zagreb revoke a newly introduced customs law.
	   The Croatian law, which became effective earlier this week,
tightens regulations for importers from neighboring Bosnia, who had
previously exported under less stringent rules making tax evasion
much easier.
	   Dozens of trucks and trailers loaded with agricultural produce
closed off five major crossing points in a sign of protest.
	   To show their anger, many merchants ditched crates of tomatoes
and paprikas onto the roads or rolled water melons down rocky
roadside cliffs.
	   They promised to block a main coastal roads also if the
government in Zagreb does not revoke the legislation.
	   Croats from southwestern-Bosnia, known as Herzegovina, are
considered hard-liners who believe the Croat-dominated region
should become part of Croatia and not be subject to taxes levied on
foreigners.
	   Many fought in Croat uniforms during Croatia's war of secession
from Yugoslavia in 1991. The majority of them have Croatian
citizenship.
	   But the Croatian government has shown no signs of backing down
apart from offering to buy up the agricultural goods which are
perishing rapidly in the summer heat.

Kabila's Congo threatens war against Rwanda
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with sources saying Uvira fell to rebels, fighting
continues in Kisangani. ADDS reported comments by Congo's Justice
Minister. Trims and adds details. No pickup.
 &UR; By KAMANGA MUTOND &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   KINSHASA, Congo (AP) _ Embattled by a widening rebellion in
eastern Congo, President Laurent Kabila's government threatened
Thursday to wage war against neighboring Rwanda, which it accused
of masterminding the uprising.
	   Government spokesman Didier Mumenge warned that Congo would
``extend the war into Rwanda'' unless the international community
pressured the tiny country to withdraw Rwandan troops allegedly
deployed in Congo.
	   Congo's Justice Minister Mwenze Kongolo pledged in an interview
with CNN International to retaliate against Rwanda.
	   ``We are moving back to Rwanda,'' Kongolo said. ``This war
started in Rwanda and it is going to end in Rwanda.''
	   Mumenge described Rwanda as a criminal state that had meddled in
foreign affairs while drawing on ``a feeling of pity by the
international community'' since the 1994 Rwandan genocide.
	   He was referring to the ethnic slaughter of more than half a
million people, mainly Tutsis, by Rwandan Hutu soldiers and
militants who were subsequently driven into hiding, from where they
have attacked Rwanda's Tutsi-led government.
	   The rebellion has sparked a backlash of anger by some residents
in Congo's capital of Kinshasa against Congolese Tutsis believed to
be receiving support from Rwanda.
	   About 5,000 supporters of the ruling party chanted and sang as
they marched through the streets of Kinshasa on Thursday, calling
for guns to join the fight against ``the Rwandan invaders.''
	   The marchers carried stuffed effigies of two former members of
Kabila's inner circle _ both Tutsis _ who have apparently defected
to the rebels.
	   The two are Kabila's former confidante Gratias Bugera, a senior
government advisor who disappeared from the capital last week and
former foreign minister Bizima Karaha, who was said to be in the
eastern town of Goma with rebels who had captured the town.
	   The demonstrators, led by two popular musicians, planned to chop
off the heads of the effigies before the protest ends.
	   Several Kinshasa businesses owned by Tutsis were reportedly
robbed and burned Wednesday by local residents after a dusk-to-dawn
curfew was lifted.
	   The rebels are believed to include Banyamulenge _ Congolese
Tutsi fighters _ and Rwandan soldiers who remained in Congo after
playing a key role in Kabila's victory over longtime Zairian
dictator Mobutu Sese Seko last year.
	   The mutineers were advancing from east to west in a manner
eerily reminiscent of the early days of Kabila's eight-month march
to power that ended with Mobutu's ouster.
	   By Wednesday the key cities of Bukavu and Goma near Rwanda's
border had been seized by the rebels and fighting continued in the
city of Kisangani further into the interior, government and rebel
sources said.
	   A source in Uvira south of Bukavu, said that town had also
fallen to the rebels while fighting continued in Kisangani on
Thursday, some aid workers told the U.N. Inter-Regional Information
Network.
	   Hundreds of people were fleeing across the border to neighboring
Burundi to escape heavy fighting Wednesday.
	   However there was calm in Lubumbashi, Congo's second largest
city in the southeast, after two days of clashes that left three
people dead and dozens wounded, IRIN said citing Lubumbashi
residents.
	   A leader of the mutineers speaking on a rebel radio station
denied persistent allegations that Rwanda was conducting the
rebellion.
	   ``This is a struggle of the Congolese people,'' said Arthur
Z'Ahidi Ngoma, a veteran opposition figure who was at one time
briefly jailed by Kabila's regime.
	   Ngoma was reportedly named rebel leader by a group of former
government supporters, opposition officials and soldiers in the
eastern town of Goma on Tuesday night.
	   Rwanda's President Pasteur Bizimungu denied Wednesday his
country was involved in the conflict, but was noncommittal about
the likelihood of future intervention.
	   Three South African ministers were expected to fly to Congo's
southern city of Lubumbashi on Friday to meet with Kabila over the
hostilities, South African Foreign Minister Alfred Nzo said on
Thursday.
	   Zimbabwe, which is supplying 10 military advisors to Kabila's
government according to a Harare newspaper, has announced plans to
host a regional summit Friday or Saturday to discuss the conflict.

<TEXT>
	   ATHENS, Greece (AP) _ The World Basketball Championship has been
so low-key that even the bad-tempered Greek basketball hooligans
have been well-behaved.
	   Maybe Friday's dead-even quarterfinals will change the equation,
although these worlds must live with an asterisk: no Dream team and
few scintilating, upcoming stars on the other teams, either.
	   With respect to the Americans _ a hodgepodge of unselfish CBA
and European pros cobbled together in just over a month _ they
could win it.
	   It's that kind of a tournament.
	   ``It's really exciting for me being the underdogs and not being
the Dream Team and seeing this team deal with that,'' said U.S.
coach Rudy Tomjanovich, who agonized over the Americans' only loss
in the six qualifying games _ 84-82 to Lithuania _ to end a 26-game
U.S. win string.
	   The quarterfinals, with the U.S. and Yugoslavs topping their
groups, look like this: Argentina (3-3) vs. Yugoslavia; Spain (5-1)
vs. Greece (4-2); Lithuania (4-2) vs. Russia (5-1); United States
(5-1) vs. Italy (4-2).
	   Small crowds, except for sellouts for the Greeks, have meant no
trouble so far in Europe's most basketball-mad country.
	   ``The (Greek) basketball federation has tried to persuade the
fans that they can help by being good,'' said member Nakis
Ladopoulos. ``We put the word out in newspaers and television that
the best thing... was yelling but not making trouble or throwing
things in the arena.''
	   Yugoslavia is understaffed like the Americans but maybe more
disappointed. This might have been the year the 96 Olympic silver
medalists beat the NBA stars.
	   Missing is the NBA's Vlade Divac, injured former NBA star
Predrag Danilovic, and retired power forward Zoran Savic. Also
gone, caught up in a legal battle, are two Yugoslavs with Greek
passports: 2.03 (6-8) Predrag Stojakovic, who's signed with the
NBA's Sacramento Kings, and 2.12 (6-11) Dragan Tarlac, a
millionaire with the Greek club Olympiakos.
	   They still may have the tournament's best player in 2.12 (6-11)
Zeljko Rebraca, who leads in blocked shots _ almost four per game _
and is among the leaders in rebounds.
	   Under normal conditions, they'd beat Argentina. But things are
far from normal. Record 38C (100F) heat has scorched Athens for 10
days, and earlier in a qualifying game Italy beat Yugoslavia for
the first time in 14 years.
	   ``I don't want to comment on this game,'' said Yugoslavia's
successful young coach Zeljko Obradovic. ``The only comment I can
make is the fact that Yugoslavia is in first place in its group and
Argentina is in fourth.''
	   Spain is the shocker, without a medal since its bronze in the
'91 Europeans. Forward Alberto Herreros is the top scorer in the
tournament (20.5), Ignacio Rodriguez is among the assist leaders
and Alfonso Reyes a top rebounder.
	   The Spaniards only loss was by two points to the Americans.
	   ``We still want to prove to everyone that Spain is still among
the strongest basketball countries in the world,'' said coach Lolo
Sainz.
	   Greece is trying to better its fourth in the '94 worlds and
match the gold it won in the '87 Europeans. It's led by (2.07) 6-9
1/2 Fragiskos Alvertis, who's averaging 16.0 points.
	   ``I'm sure when we get a two-day rest you'll see that there are
other players who can help (besides Alvertis),'' coach Panagiotis
Giannakis said.
	   Lithuania vs. Russia should write itself.
	   Lithuania, which supplied much of the talent to the powerful
Soviet Union teams, is playing in its first worlds after winning
bronze in the last two Olympics.
	   Former Seton Hall star Arturas Karnisovas _ with Spain's
Herreros and Yugoslavia's Rebraca _ has been among the standouts
averaging 18.6.
	   The Russians, still relying no Soviet-era players, have a chance
to top the silver they won four years ago behind the Dream Team.
	   These are essentially the same Russians that took bronze a year
ago in the Europeans, but played poorly in the recent Goodwill
Games with the top scoring coming from Vassiliy Karassev (15.8) and
Sergei Babkov (12.8).
	   The Americans beat Italy 80-75 a few weeks ago in a practice
game and should win again.
	   ``We still have a ways to go. None of us guys has ever really
played together,'' said Jimmy Oliver, the top scorer at 14.0. ``We
have a bunch of guys snatched out of the air and thrown together.
But we've been doing a good job despite that.''
	   Italy, the silver medalists a year ago in the Euros, is led by
British-born guard Carlton Myers and Slovenian-born 2.15 (7-0)
center Gregor Fucha.
	   ``They're a pretty big team,'' said former Michigan guard Jimmy
King. ``What we have to do is not let them push us around.''

Macedonian elections to be held in October
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   SKOPJE, Macedonia (AP) _ The elections for Macedonia's 120-seat
parliament will be held on Oct. 18, the speaker of the former
Yugoslav republic's legislature announced Thursday.
	   Tito Petkovski said the date for the third Macedonian
parliamentary elections since the state split from former
Yugoslavia in 1992 was agreed by all political parties.
	   The previous Macedonian elections, won by the ruling Social
Democrats, were held in November 1994.
	   It was not announced how many parties will field their
candidates in October. Most of the opposition parties have
boycotted the previous vote, claiming election fraud.
	   It is also not clear how many ethnic Albanian parties, which
represent about one-quarter of Macedonia's 2.2 million people, will
participate.
	   There are an estimated 1.5 million eligible voters in Macedonia.

Michelle Smith banned for four years

Smith's previous public statement in new last three grafs &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   LAUSANNE, Switzerland (AP) _ Irish swimmer Michelle Smith,
winner of three gold medals at the 1996 Atlanta Olympics, was
banned for four years Thursday after the sport's governing body
determined she tampered with a urine sample.
	   The decision was announced by the international swimming
federation (FINA), 13 days after a hearing by its doping panel.
	   The suspension goes into effect immediately, FINA said.
	   Smith's lawyer, Peter Lennon, was not immediately available for
comment. But Lennon has previously said he would appeal to a higher
court if Smith was found guilty.
	   Smith escaped FINA's maximum punishment _ a life ban.
	   But a four-year suspension, if upheld, would effectively end her
career. She is 28 and would miss the 2000 Sydney Olympics and the
next world championships in 2001 in Fukuoka, Japan.
	   In an unprecedented case, Smith is believed to be the first
swimmer or top-flight athlete banned for manipulating a drug test.
As a triple Olympic medalist, she is one of the highest-profile
competitors ever banned for a doping offense.
	   Smith was charged with manipulating an out-of-competition drug
test in January by adulterating her urine sample with alcohol.
	   In April, FINA announced that Smith's samples, tested at the
IOC-accredited laboratory in Barcelona, Spain, showed ``unequivocal
signs of adulteration'' and ``physical manipulation.''
	   Both samples allegedly contained a lethal concentration of
whiskey, suggesting an attempt to mask the presence of banned
drugs.
	   Under FINA rules, tampering with a urine sample is considered as
serious as taking steroids.
	   FINA said Thursday that its investigation found that the urine
was ``manipulated by the swimmer'' but ``the way of manipulation is
uncertain.''
	   FINA said it found that the manipulation was not carried out in
the laboratory, during the transport or by the collectors of the
sample.
	   The statement said Smith was banned under two rules _ one
covering a ``a competitor (who) uses or takes advantage of a banned
procedure'' and the other for ``use of substances and methods which
alter the integrity and validity of urine samples used in doping
control.''
	   Smith, who says she has been tested more often than any other
international swimmer, underwent the out-of-season urine test in
Kilkenny County, Ireland, on Jan. 10.
	   Smith and her lawyer appeared at the FINA hearing in Lausanne on
July 24. FINA's statement said she ``stressed the fact that no
banned substance has been detected in her urine'' and she stated
that ``from her side there was no physical manipulation of the
sample.''
	   Smith has persistently denied taking performance-enhancing
drugs. Her coach and husband is former Dutch discus throwner Eric
De Bruin, who served a four-year ban in track and field after
testing positive for high levels of testosterone.
	   Smith has been surrounded by allegations and rumors of drug use
ever since she won gold medals in Atlanta in the 400 freestyle, 200
individual medley and 400 individual medley. She also won a bronze
medal in the 200 butterfly.
	   In her last major competition, Smith won two gold medals (400
individual medley and 200 freestyle) at the 1997 European
Championships in Seville, Spain.
	   Smith missed this year's world championships in Perth,
Australia, citing injuries.
	   In her only public comments on the allegations against her,
Smith read a statement at a news conference in Dublin on April 29.
	   ``I am innocent of these charges,'' she said. ``I am appalled at
the manner in which they have been leaked into the public domain
and I intend fully defending them, if necessary, all to the way to
the International Sports Court in Switzerland.
	   ``I have no intention of taking this lying down and I have no
intention of being bullied by any organization, national or
international.''

Outcry in Israel over funds withheld from Holocaust survivors
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: AMs. Recasts.
 &UR; By JACK KATZENELL &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ The disclosure that elderly, mentally ill
Holocaust survivors were being denied use of reparation money
earmarked for them drew widespread condemnation in Israel on
Thursday.
	   Millions of dollars in reparations paid by Germany are sitting
in the patients' bank accounts, but government trustees have
refused to approve using the money to improve their bleak living
conditions.
	   The controversy came to light when doctors at Abarbanel Hospital
near Tel Aviv said proposals to use the funds for televisions, air
conditioners and holiday parties for the patients had been denied
by government trustees.
	   Avraham Hirschson, head of a parliamentary committee dealing
with reparations to Holocaust survivors, called on parliament to
return from its summer recess and hold emergency debate on the
``the disgraceful exploitation of Holocaust survivors' funds.''
	   Israel's chief rabbi, Meir Lau _ himself a Holocaust survivor _
called the allegations shocking, and said he planned to visit the
patients to try to ease their plight.
	   ``I think the power of every moral society depends on its
approach to the weakest, and our weakest are Holocaust survivors
who are not healthy in mind and spirit,'' he said.
	   Avner Shalev, chairman of Yad Vashem, Israel's Holocaust
memorial and museum, said he was ``simply astounded by the
insensitivity and the malice'' of the officials involved.
	   He proposed transferring control of the funds to a body ``with
the sensitivity needed to work with Holocaust survivors.''
	   About 900 of the 360,000 Holocaust survivors who live in Israel
are believed to be in mental hospitals. Most have been
institutionalized since they came to Israel in the 1940s and 1950s
and were unable to adjust to life in a new Jewish state that wanted
to look to the future rather than remember past sufferings.
	   The survivors, many in their 80s, suffer from illnesses that
include acute depression and schizophrenia, which are attributed to
their experiences in the Nazi death camps.
	   Some have accumulated large sums of money in reparations from
the German government, receiving as much as several hundred dollars
a month for the past four decades. The Maariv newspaper, which
first reported the story, estimated that altogether the patients
have several million dollars.
	   Due to their mental illnesses, these survivors were made wards
of the state. Their bank accounts are administered by the
court-appointed Fund for the Care of Dependents, which is
supervised by the government's General Custodian for Wards,
attorney Shmuel Tsur.
	   Tsur and fund director Avi Angel blame each other for the
failure to release the funds.
	   Jonathan Lemberger, head of a support organization for Holocaust
survivors, said the situation was symptomatic of a wider problem.
He also said the state was withholding other Holocaust reparation
money, including the legacies of survivors who died without heirs.
	   ``The mental patients' accounts are only the tip of the
iceberg,'' he said.

Court upholds Vatican on rights to pope's voice
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   VATICAN CITY (AP) _ An Italian court has held that Vatican Radio
has exclusive rights to use of the pope's voice.
	   The decision, reported by Vatican Radio, as well as by the
Italian news agency ANSA on Thursday, ordered that all copies of
the compact disc ``Forgive Us'' produced by two Italian musicians
be withdrawn from sale.
	   The CD reproduced part of a Gregorian chant sung by Pope John
Paul II during a New Year's Day Mass last year.
	   Last month, bowing to a Vatican veto, Italian designer Kean Etro
on Tuesday gave up plans embellish his fashion show on Rome's
Spanish Steps with a recording of the pope singing.
	   Vatican Radio, which has exclusive rights to papal recordings,
refused permission, threatening to take Etro to court to stop him.

Iraqis to receive full rations of food for first time in 12 months
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By WAIEL FALEH &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   BAGHDAD, Iraq (AP) _ Iraqis will receive their full rations of
food in August for the first time in 12 months, the U.N.
Humanitarian Coordinator's spokesman said Thursday.
	   Iraqis have endured food rationing since shortly after the U.N.
Security Council imposed comprehensive sanctions against their
country following its invasion of Kuwait in 1990. The rations were
doled out by the government until the U.N. oil-for-food program
began in the first half of 1997.
	   Under the program, which allows Iraq to sell limited amounts of
oil in order to buy food and humanitarian goods, the United Nations
approves the purchase of food supplies and supervises their
distribution.
	   ``A full food ration will be made available to the Iraqi
population in August, with all commodities supplied from Security
Council Resolution 986 funds,'' Eric Falt, the spokesman for the
Humanitarian Coordinator, said. ``This is the first time this has
occurred since August 1997.''
	   He said that previously ``delays in delivery by foreign
suppliers'' had reduced the quantities of food available.
	   Falt added that under the current phase of the oil-for-food
program, in which Iraq has been allowed to more than double its
sale of oil, shipments of food are expected to arrive in late
September.
	   ``This will include weaning cereals for infants and milk and
cheese for the rest of the population,'' he said.
	   Asked if the latest argument between the Iraqi government and
the U.N. disarmament commission could affect the food distribution
program, Falt told The Associated Press: ``We are encountering no
difficulties of any sort in our work.''

Latest confrontation with Iraq produces calmer Western reaction

<TEXT>
	   CAIRO, Egypt (AP) _ Last November, when Iraq expelled American
weapons inspectors on U.N. teams from Baghdad, the United States
responded swiftly by sending aircraft carriers and building up its
forces in the Gulf.
	   In the latest dispute, triggered by Iraqi leader Saddam
Hussein's announcement Wednesday that he would ``completely suspend
cooperation'' with U.N. weapons teams, the reaction from Washington
has been restrained.
	   ``At the end of the day, we will judge the situation on Iraqi
actions, not Iraqi words,'' said White House spokesman P.J.
Crowley.
	   Analysts in the Middle East believe Saddam is betting it will be
harder for the United States to respond firmly to his defiance of
the United Nations this time.
	   Arab governments _ mindful of the deep public sympathy over the
plight of Iraq's 20 million people after eight years of U.N. trade
sanctions _ are as loath now as they were last winter to support
military strikes against Iraq.
	   And the near demise of the Middle East peace process, which most
Arabs blame on America's failure to pressure Israel, has not built
confidence that the United States is being even-handed in the
region.
	   Experts also cite U.S. President Bill Clinton's deepening legal
troubles over allegations he had a sexual relationship with former
White House intern Monica Lewinsky and lied about it.
	   ``The president has to testify on Aug. 17, so he doesn't have
much time to deal with a crisis in Iraq,'' Abdel-Moneim Said Aly,
head of Cairo's Al-Ahram Center for Political and Strategic
Studies, told The Associated Press.
	   He added: ``That would suggest there's some interest in
postponing any confrontation for at least a couple of weeks.''
	   Washington could become more outspoken if the situation heats
up. But it did not get much support for threatened use of force in
last winter's crisis.
	   Among Arabs, even staunch ally Saudi Arabia refused to have its
territory used for an attack on Iraq. Of the U.N. Security
Council's five permanent members, only Britain joined in issuing
military threats against Baghdad.
	   The three other permanent members _ France, Russia and China _
reacted coolly to the idea and have since sought to ease sanctions
against Iraq.
	   The last crises ended on Feb. 23, when U.N. Secretary-General
Kofi Annan negotiated a deal in Baghdad in which Iraq promised to
cooperate with U.N. weapons teams and to open Saddam's palaces _ at
the center of the dispute _ to inspection.
	   Newspapers across the Arab world on Thursday again expressed
support for a political rather than military solution.
	   The English-language Egyptian Gazette, in an editorial titled
``Mere hiccup or brinkmanship?'' _ urged compromise to avoid a
showdown ``fueled by Washington's trigger happiness ... and the
growing pessimism inside Iraq over the prolonged crippling
sanctions.''
	   In Jordan, an editorial in the mass circulation Ad-Dustour urged
the international community ``to form a deterrent political and
moral force against the policies of warships'' and to push for
lifting the sanctions.

U.S. to send Estonia rifles
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   TALLINN, Estonia (AP) - The United States will provide the
Estonian military with more than 40,000 rifles, the U.S. embassy in
Tallinn said Thursday.
	   The M-14 rifles, which are slated to be delivered next year,
will be used to arm Estonia's 80,000-strong reserve forces.
Estonia's standing army numbers just 2,500 and the reserves are a
key part of the nation's defense forces.
	   Many of the reserves do not have guns, or use badly outdated
ones.
	   The United States is donating the rifles, whose total value is
around dlrs 2.4 million, the embassy said in a statement. It would
be one of the largest donations of arms to Estonia since it became
independent in 1991.
	   Estonian defense officials say guerrilla warfare in the
country's thick forces would be a cornerstone of defense strategy
if the country were attacked.

Former generals, Cabinet ministers pledge fight for more democracy
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   JAKARTA, Indonesia (AP) _ A group of retired generals, former
Cabinet ministers and senior politicians pledged Thursday to
struggle for more democracy in Indonesia.
	   The group, calling itself ``Barisan Nasional,'' or national
front, declared that a major aim would be to weaken the influence
of the ruling Golkar party in the government.
	   ``If the domination of Golkar could be decreased, then the
sovereignty will practically be back to the people,'' said Kemal
Idris, a retired army lieutenant general who chairs the front.
	   He told reporters after a ceremony inaugurating the front that
the government under new President B.J. Habibie was not much
different than its predecessor.
	   Habibie, then vice president, became the head of government
after Suharto quit on May 21 amid violence and widespread protests
against his 32-year authoritarian rule.
	   Suharto, a retired army general, took power in 1966 from
founding President Sukarno and ruled the country with an iron hand
with support from Golkar and the military.
	   Habibie has promised reforms, but many critics view most of his
policies as continuations of Suharto's.
	   Idris said the forum will monitor all actions of Habibie.
	   ``We will support all political parties fighting for total
reform, and we insist not to support Golkar,'' Idris said, adding
that the forum has no intention to turn into a political party.
	   Its secretary-general is Subroto, a former minister of mines and
energy and former secretary-general of the Organization of
Petroleum Exporting Countries.
	   Also joining the forum was retired army general Edy Sudradjat,
who lost the race for the Golkar chairmanship last month to State
Secretary Akbar Tandjung.
	   Besides more than 10 retired generals, the forum also was
supported by two former Parliament speakers, a number of former
Golkar executives and former Cabinet ministers under Suharto.

	   HIROSHIMA, Japan (AP) _ Thousands gathered in sweltering weather
Thursday to commemorate the 53rd anniversary of the world's first
atomic bombing, and to urge India and Pakistan to halt their
nuclear weapons programs.
	   Many in the estimated crowd of 50,000 clasped their hands in
prayer or held Buddhist rosaries as silence was observed at 8:15
a.m. (2315 GMT) _ the exact moment a U.S. atomic bomb exploded
above Hiroshima on Aug. 6, 1945.
	   With the Indian and Pakistani ambassadors present, Japanese
Prime Minister Keizo Obuchi condemned the South Asian countries'
series of atomic weapons tests in May, which have cast a pall over
international efforts to curb the spread of nuclear arms.
	   ``It is very regrettable that both India and Pakistan carried
out nuclear tests in May,'' said Obuchi, who took office last month
and appeared for the first time at the annual observances.
	   Hiroshima Mayor Takashi Hiraoka used stronger language in
telling the crowd that those tests raised tensions in South Asia
and shook the foundation of the world's nuclear non-proliferation
movement.
	   ``The people in Hiroshima feel a strong rage against the nuclear
tests by the two nations, and worry about inducing a chain reaction
of nuclear competition,'' Hiraoka said.
	   Thousands of miles (kilometers) away, throngs of protesters in
India also marked the anniversary, shouting ``Bread not Bombs!''
and warning that an atomic weapons race in their region could lead
to another nuclear catastrophe like the one that destroyed
Hiroshima.
	   ``Both India and Pakistan now have the capability to perpetrate
the horrors of Hiroshima and Nagasaki on each other, not once but
many times,'' said a resolution by activists at an anti-nuclear
march in the Indian capital of New Delhi.
	   The Indian and Pakistani ambassadors told reporters in Hiroshima
that their countries remained committed to non-proliferation
efforts and that Thursday's ceremonies served as a reminder of the
devastation nuclear weapons can inflict.
	   Indian Ambassador Sidharth Singh said the memorial ceremony
``brings back to you in very vivid form the horrors of atomic bombs
and it renews one's commitment to make every effort toward
elimination of these weapons.''
	   The anniversary observances began with the offering of flowers
at the city's Peace Park. As in most years, the moment of silence
was broken only by the ringing of a Buddhist bell and the chirping
of cicadas.
	   For the first time, Hiroshima invited the ambassadors to Japan
from the five major nuclear powers _ the United States, Britain,
China, France and Russia _ as well as those from India and
Pakistan. But only India's Singh and Pakistan's Touqir Hussain
attended, said Mayumi Tochino of the Hiroshima city office.
	   Hussain said he attended the ceremony ``to share the pain and
suffering of the Japanese people and the people of Hiroshima as
they recall this tragedy.''
	   About 140,000 people were killed by the atomic bombing of
Hiroshima and the firestorm and radiation that ensued in the
western city, a major military center during World War II.
	   Three days after the Hiroshima attack, the United States dropped
a second atom bomb on Nagasaki, on Japan's southern main island of
Kyushu, killing 70,000 people. Japan surrendered unconditionally on
Aug. 15, 1945.
	   Like the rest of Japan, Hiroshima rebuilt after the war. But the
remains of a half-destroyed government exhibition hall, now called
the Atomic Dome, were left to remind visitors of the massive
destruction. Hiroshima, 690 kilometers (425 miles) southwest of
Tokyo, is now a thriving commercial center of 1.1 million people.
	   Today, many Japanese believe the atomic bombings of the two
cities were unjustified, despite Japan's war of aggression. But
U.S. wartime leaders defended the bombings as the only alternative
to a bloody invasion of mainland Japan, and many Americans still
hold that viewpoint.

Zambia appeals for Congo peace, receives Congolese refugees
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   LUSAKA, Zambia (AP) _ President Frederick Chiluba has appealed
for all parties in the conflict in Congo to seek and alternative to
further blood letting.
	   Chiluba spoke Wednesday night at a banquet for visiting
President Pasteur Bizimungu of Rwanda.
	   Congolese President Laurent Kabila's government on Thursday
threatened to wage war on Rwanda, which it claims has supported
disaffected ethnic Tutsi troops that have taken several towns in
eastern Congo, formerly known as Zaire.
	   Bizimungu denied that Rwanda was involved, but said that Rwanda
could get involved if there wre ``serious reasons.''
	   Kabila ousted former corrupt dictator Mobutu Sese Seko last year
with the help of the ethnic Tutsi, or Banyamulenge, troops, who
have tribal ties to Tutsis in Rwanda.
	   ``After years of abject neglect and stagnation, the advent of a
new administration in Congo promised great hope for nation building
and development.'' Chiluba said. ``Regrettably the country is now
hemorrhaging and stands on the brink of reversal.''
	   More than 100 Banyamulenge troops fled into Zambia earlier this
week, Defense Minister Chitalu Sampa said on Thursday.
	   Sampa told the South African Press Association that the troops
had been disarmed and given lodging at police stations in the
border area copper mining belt.

Argentine striker extends contract with Fiorentina
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   FLORENCE, Italy (AP) _ Argentine striker Gabriel Batistuta,
giving up his long-announced transfer plans, on Thursday extended
his contract with Italian first-division Fiorentina through 2003.
	   Fiorentina officials said a new contract was signed following a
final round of talks with the player and his agent Settimio Aloisio
in the headquarters of the Florentine club.
	   Fiorentina did not immediately announced terms of Batistuta's
new contract.
	   ``Everything has been settled, but it was not easy to reach an
agreement,'' Batistuta told the ANSA news agency. ``All problems
have been resolved.''
	   The 29-year-old Argentine star, one of the leading strikers in
the recent World Cup, had repeatedly said before and during France
'98 that he wanted to leave Fiorentina and experience new
challenges with another club.
	   Parma and AS Roma had been bidding for the Argentine striker,
nicknamed ``Batigoal'' by Florentine fans.
	   Movie tycoon Vittorio Cecchi Gori, Fiorentina's president, and
newly-signed coach Giovanni Trapattoni had strongly opposed
Batistuta's transfer.
	   The Argentine player, formerly of Boca Juniors, has been playing
with Fiorentina since he transferred to Italy in 1991.
	   Fiorentina officials will have now to deal with Edmundo, the
Brazilian forward who wants to part from the Florentine club after
signing a four-year contract last year.

Vietnam says jobless rising, but not sure how much
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   HANOI, Vietnam (AP) _ Vietnam hasn't been hit as hard as other
Asian countries by unemployment, but it's not sure just how bad
things are, a Labor Ministry official said Thursday.
	   Because the country has no unemployment insurance program, it
has to rely on annual surveys for its figures, Vice Minister Nguyen
Luong Trao said. The current study is under way now.
	   A preliminary survey in May of 2,214 enterprises indicated they
had shed an average of 8 percent of their work forces, Trao said.
	   Unemployment rose only slightly from 5.88 percent in 1996 to
6.01 percent last year, according to official figures that foreign
analysts believe are underestimated.
	   The number of jobless has gone up significantly so far this year
as businesses have been hit hard by the fallout of the Asian
economic crisis.
	   Vietnam, fearing the increased costs of its dollar-denominated
foreign debt and badly needed imports, has refused to allow its
currency to fall as sharply as many of its regional competitors. As
a result, its exports have become relatively more expensive.
	   Trao said the government is looking at all possibilities to cut
unemployment, including an acceleration of low-interest loans for
those who create jobs.
	   But he added that illegal job-search companies would be
subjected to a crackdown because some have cheated or overcharged
clients, demanding thousands of dollars in exchange for promises of
lucrative jobs overseas.
	   Vietnam is one of the world's poorest countries.

	   NEW DELHI, India (AP) _ On the 53rd anniversary of the Hiroshima
bombing Thursday, Indian scientists, writers, painters, students
and factory workers shouted ``bread not bombs'' and warned that a
similar horror could happen in their region.
	   ``Both India and Pakistan now have the capability to perpetrate
the horrors of Hiroshima and Nagasaki on each other, not once but
many times,'' said a resolution by activists whose anti-nuclear
march in New Delhi attracted 5,000 people from all walks of life.
	   India tested nuclear weapons in May, prompting neighbor and
longtime rival Pakistan to do the same.
	   ``The people of India and Pakistan must stop this madness which
threatens us with mutual annihilation,'' the resolution said.
	   ``Bread, not bombs!'' the protesters chanted.
	   Nearly 250,000 people marched through the streets of the eastern
Indian metropolis of Calcutta, chanting slogans that nuclear tests
will lead to destruction. State government ministers, writers,
painters and academics joined the protest against nuclear testing
by India and Pakistan.
	   Smaller rallies were held in Bombay, Bangalore, Hyderabad and
other cities in India.
	   Only about 200 people turned out for an anti-nuclear march in
Islamabad, the Pakistani capital
	   ``Don't make our cities Hiroshima and Nagazaki,'' read one
English-language banner that misspelled the name of the second
Japanese city to be hit by an American atomic bomb.
	   In the eastern Pakistani city of Lahore, human rights activist
I.A. Rahman told about 200 demonstrators: ``We are not against any
government, we are against nuclear weapons.''

At least three killed, one wounded in Philippine family feud
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   ZAMBOANGA, Philippines (AP) _ Two feuding families exchanged
mortar and automatic weapons fire in four hours of sporadic
fighting Thursday, killing at least three people and injuring one
other, the military said.
	   Lt. Col. Horacio Lapinid said marines were sent to the island of
Siasi in southern Sulu province to halt the fighting.
	   Lapinid did not say what triggered Thursday's clash but said the
two families have been battling over conflicting claims to
ancestral lands in Siasi for years.
	   He said all the known casualties belonged to the family of Surab
Hawad. It was not known if the rival family of Hadji Alawi suffered
any casualties because soldiers were prevented from entering its
territory.
	   Lapinid said the two families fought fiercely for 15 minutes,
then shifted to sporadic fighting that lasted for four hours before
the military intervened.
	   Both families are led by rich merchants who are able to buy
illegal weapons, including mortars, the military said.

Promoting local ports not violating WTO, Malaysia says
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia (AP) _ Malaysia's move to promote local
ports among its traders is not an attempt to undermine other ports,
the trade and industry minister said Thursday.
	   Malaysia's encouragement of its ports was consistent with the
rules of the World Trade Organization, a global body that deals
with international commerce and trade disputes, Bernama news agency
quoted Rafidah Aziz as saying.
	   ``We are not discriminating against any country. We are not
discriminating against Singapore,'' she said.
	   Last week, Singapore Trade and Industry Minister Lee Yock Suan
reportedly said he would complain to the World Trade Organization
if Malaysia prevented its companies from using Singapore ports.
	   Many Malaysian traders prefer using Singapore because cargo is
handled faster there. Since the economic crisis has worsened,
Malaysia has tried to encourage traders to use its ports to boost
revenue. Forty percent of Malaysian imports and exports pass
through Singapore.
	   ``We are not saying, don't use Singapore ports and don't use
anybody else's port. We are just saying, use our own ports and that
is within our right to do so,'' Rafidah said.
	   Rafidah's comments come amid cool relations between Malaysia and
Singapore, caused by differences over shifting of a railroad
immigration and customs point.
	   On Thursday, Malaysian Deputy Prime Minister Anwar Ibrahim
expressed regret over the worsening of ties.
	   ``I would certainly share the sentiments expressed by all
parties in expressing our exasperation and regret at some of the
unilateral positions taken by Singapore,'' Anwar told reporters.
	   Malaysia says Singapore shifted the railroad checkpoint despite
Kuala Lumpur's objections.

 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu acknowledged
Thursday he had discussed the upcoming appointment of a Greek
Catholic archbishop in Israel with church officials _ an unusual
step for a politician.
	   ``I discussed the nomination with the Vatican's representative
in Israel, and expressed my concern regarding the politicization of
nominations of the church,'' Netanyahu said. The appointment went
to a Palestinian refugee.
	   The Israeli paper Maariv said the prime minister had made it
clear to leaders of both the Greek Catholic church and the Vatican
that he wanted Emil Shufani, a bishop considered friendly to the
Israeli government, to be appointed the archbishop in the Galilee.
	   Maariv reported that the Vatican was unhappy over what was seen
as inappropriate political interference in a Holy See appointment.
Pope John Paul II picked another bishop, Butros Mualem, to the
position.
	   The Vatican had no immediate comment on the matter.
	   The Greek Catholic community is the largest Christian community
in Israel and _ like the Latin Orthodox church _ considers the pope
its supreme authority. The archbishop is the highest-ranking
regional authority for the Greek Catholic community.
	   An Israeli security official, speaking on condition of
anonymity, said it was feared that Mualem, a Palestinian refugee
serving as a bishop in Brazil, might incite the Catholic community
against Israel.
	   According to the official, Yasser Arafat's Palestinian Authority
pressured the local church council to recommend Mualem for the
appointment, and it was in response to this that Netanyahu decided
to get involved.
	   Netanyahu said the change in appointments was ``due to certain
pressures,'' imposed on the Vatican, but did not elaborate.
Netanyahu said Israel was still discussing the matter with the
Church.

Government denies official under investigation
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   HANOI, Vietnam (AP) _ The government issued a strongly worded
denial Thursday of a published report that a high-ranking official
was under investigation for alleged corruption.
	   The Far Eastern Economic Review reported in its Thursday
editions that allegations against Pham The Duyet, one of five
members of the Vietnamese Politburo's elite standing committee, had
been discussed during the Communist Party plenum in July.
	   The magazine said the discussion had centered on claims made in
a letter from 11 senior comrades that Duyet used state money to
acquire homes in Hanoi for himself and his children, and permitted
the capital's bureaucrats to do the same.
	   Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Phan Thuy Thanh told a regular
briefing for reporters that neither Duyet nor any other standing
committee members were under investigation.
	   ``The ... information is completely untrue and groundless,'' she
said, adding that the matter had not been discussed at the plenum.
	   She said she was not aware of the contents of the letter, a copy
of which was obtained Thursday by The Associated Press.
	   In it, party veteran Doan Nhan Dao and the others demanded that
Duyet and Dinh Hanh, a Hanoi official, should declare their assets
as the law requires.
	   The government has made fighting corruption one of its top
priorities. Anger over corruption by local officials sparked unrest
in several provinces in 1997, and there have been reports of
further trouble this year.

Text of FINA statement
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   LAUSANNE, Switzerland (AP) _ The full text of FINA's statement
announcing a four-year ban for Irish swimmer Michelle Smith:
	   ``On Jan. 10, 1998, the swimmer Mrs. Michelle Smith de Bruin
(Ireland) had to undergo an unannounced doping control in her home
in Dublin, Ireland, as part of the FINA out-of-competition Doping
Control Program. The sample was tested in the IOC-accredited
laboratory in Barcelona, Spain. On Jan. 30, 1998, the laboratory
informed FINA that:
	   `Unequivocal signs of adulteration have been found in sample
coded AO74396. The content of alcohol of the sample (concentration
higher than 100mg/ml) is in no way compatible with human
consumption and the sample shows a very strong whiskey odour. Its
low specific gravity (0.983 g/ml) is also compatible with a
physical manipulation.'
	   The analysis of the B-sample was performed on May 21, 1998. The
results were in agreement with those found in the corresponding
A-sample.
	   A hearing before the FINA Doping Panel was held on July 24,
1998, in Lausanne, Switzerland. The swimmer attended the hearing
and she was represented by her lawyer. The swimmer stressed the
fact that no banned substance has been detected in her urine. She
asserts that from her side there was no phyical manipulation of the
sample.
	   The FINA Doping Panel found that:
	   the urine was manipulated.
	   the urine had not been manipulated in the laboratory.
	   the urine had not been manipulated during transport.
	   the urine had not been manipulated by the collectors of the
sample.
	   the urine was manipulated by the swimmer, the way of
manipulation is uncertain.
	   this is a doping offence according to FINA Rules DC 1.2 (b)/DC
3.1 (b).
	   DECISION &QC; 
	   The Federation Internationale de Natation Amateur (FINA doping
panel) has decided to suspend the swimmer for a period of four (4)
years from competing in any national or international competition.
	   Mrs. de Bruin is suspended for having committed a doping offence
under FINA Rule DC 1.2 (b) _ `a competitor uses or takes advantage
of a banned procedure' and under FINA Rule DC 3.1 (b) _ `use of
substances and methods which alter the integrity and validity or
urine samples used in doping.'
	   The sanction shall be in force immediately from today, Aug. 6,
1988, the date of this judgment.

U.S., Vietnam hope to expedite trade pact next month
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   HANOI, Vietnam (AP) _ Vietnam and the United States hope to
expedite a trade agreement when they meet for the sixth round of
talks next month, Foreign Ministry officials said Thursday.
	   The deal, widely considered an important step in Vietnam's
further opening its economy and pursuing membership in the World
Trade Organization, has been bogged down in a number of issues. The
last round of negotiations was held in May.
	   Stanley Roth, assistant secretary of state for East Asia and the
Pacific, is visiting Vietnam to talk about progress on the pact and
a number of other economic and humanitarian issues.
	   They include living conditions for Vietnam's ethnic hill tribes,
stymied talks on an agreement for direct flights between the two
countries, and the long-term effects of Agent Orange, a toxic
defoliant heavily used by U.S. forces in the Vietnam War.
	   The impetus for Vietnam to conclude a trade pact is rising as
its economy slows amid the fallout of the Asian economic crisis. It
is courting foreign investors from outside Asia, where competition
for funds has become increasingly tight.

Allstate gets OK to provide life insurance in Philippines
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MANILA, Philippines (AP) _ Allstate Life Insurance Co. of the
Philippines Inc., a subsidiary of the U.S. insurance group Allstate
Insurance Co., said Thursday it has received approval from finance
authorities to provide life insurance in the Philippines.
	   Allstate said it is in the process of setting up its Philippine
operations to market life insurance products through an agent
network.
	   While a number of foreign insurers operate in the Philippines,
the concept of life insurance has not struck much of a chord among
Filipinos.
	   It is estimated that only around 10 percent of the country's 70
million people have life insurance, a trend that is in marked
contrast with some other Asian countries.

Laos authorities arrest two Thai prison escapees
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) _ Thai police will travel to Laos to take
home two prison escapees arrested there after they fled across the
border last weekend, Thai television Channel 7 reported Thursday.
	   The convicts, both drug traffickers, escaped Saturday from a
prison in Loei province, 430 kilometers (270 miles) northeast of
Bangkok. Police sought help from Laos to catch them.
	   Police will also look into allegations that there may have been
prison officials involved in the escape.

Albania receives fresh loan from Italy
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   TIRANA, Albania (AP) - Under an agreement signed Thursday, Italy
granted impoverished Albania a credit of about dlrs 120 million,
including a dlrs 17 million donation.
	   ``We consider Albania the absolute priority of our foreign
policy,'' Piero Fassino, an undersecretary in the Italian Foreign
Ministry, said after the signing.
	   This low-interest credit will be used for the Albanian civil
service, hospitals and schools. Part of it will be invested for
assisting small and medium-sized enterprises.
	   Albania, which emerged backward and impoverished from more than
four decades of Stalinist repression, is still suffering from the
after-effects of general chaos that followed the collapse of
pyramid schemes and shattered the fledgling economy.
	   Now, with the conflict in Yugoslavia's Kosovo province
escalating, the government of Albania is worried that it might
spill over its borders.
	   More than 13,000 ethnic Albanians have fled the fighting,
leaving their homes and crossing the Albanian border to seek
shelter in Albania proper.
	   ``We are talking about how to help the refugees of Kosovo, to
help them in their daily life,'' Fassino said.
	   He also reiterated the Rome government's view that the Kosovo
crisis must be resolved through talks.
	   ``There is no military solution for the Kosovo conflict. The
solution should be political, the result of negotiations,'' Fassino
told reporters.

Soccer arrests down but violent offenses on rise
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ The number of hooligans arrested at domestic
league soccer matches in England and Wales dropped for the fifth
consecutive year during the 1997-98 season, police said Thursday.
	   But the number of violent soccer-related crimes was on the rise,
the statistics revealed.
	   Arrests for assault increased from 19 to 110, arrests for
violent disorder increased from 23 to 52, while 31 people were
arrested for throwing missiles compared with 11 the previous
season.
	   The figures showed a 14.6 percent decrease in arrests during the
1997-98 season, with a total of 3,307 people arrested at soccer
matches _ or 13.4 arrests for every 100,000 people attending games.
	   Arrests for offensive and racist chanting also increased by
almost three times, from 10 to 33, the National Criminal
Intelligence Service reported.
	   Detective Superintendent Bryan Drew, head of specialist
intelligence at NCIS, said more than half of the arrests took place
outside soccer grounds.
	   ``The numbers remain comparatively small, especially when one
considers the large increase in people going to watch football,''
he said. ``But it is this hard core that causes a disproportionate
amount of misery and still needs to be eradicated.''

Russian border troops guarding against Taliban incursion
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Russian troops who patrol Tajikistan's border with
Afghanistan have taken measures to prevent Taliban forces from
crossing in case they overrun northern-based opposition forces, the
border guard chief said Thursday.
	   ``Appropriate instructions have already been given to forestall
an advance by Taliban fighters,'' Border Service chief Nikolai
Bordyuzha said, according to the Interfax news agency.
	   The measures would also prevent an influx of refugees chased out
by the Taliban, he said.
	   Russia considers the Taliban advance a potentially grave
security threat. Moscow fears that the rise of a radical Islamic
state in Afghanistan would bring an influx of refugees and arms
into Central Asia, causing unrest in a region already strained by
political rivalries and economic hardship.
	   About 25,000 Russian troops are stationed in Tajikistan to
support the government and guard the Afghan border from smugglers
and fighters.
	   Three ex-Soviet nations along Afghanistan's northern border _
Tajikistan, Turkmenistan and Uzbekistan _ are members of the
Russian-led Commonwealth of Independent States. An incursion into
their territory would activate the joint CIS defense mechanism.

Utility pulls plug on Siberian railroad for nonpayment of bills
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ An electric company cut off power Thursday to a
railway in southern Siberia that hadn't paid its bills, halting 48
trains, including nine passenger trains, a news agency reported.
	   Engineers on the Trans-Baikal Railway replaced electric
locomotives with diesel ones and managed to put seven trains back
into service, ITAR-Tass said. The other trains remained idle.
	   The Chitenergo company, the main energy provider in the Chita
region, about 4,700 kilometers (3,000 miles) east of Moscow, cut
off the railway for non-payment of its bills, a railroad official
acknowledged.
	   Sergei Suturin, a deputy chief of the Trans-Baikal Railway, said
the railroad fell behind in its payments because of a slump in
cargo traffic, and currently owes the utility 60 million rubles
(dlrs 10 million).

<TEXT>
	   KINSHASA, Congo (AP) _ Embattled by a widening rebellion in
eastern Congo, President Laurent Kabila's government threatened
Thursday to wage war against neighboring Rwanda, which it accused
of masterminding the uprising.
	   Government spokesman Didier Mumenge warned that Congo would
``extend the war into Rwanda'' unless the international community
pressured the tiny country to withdraw Rwandan troops allegedly
deployed in Congo.
	   Congo's Justice Minister Mwenze Kongolo also pledged in an
interview with CNN International to retaliate against Rwanda.
	   ``We are moving back to Rwanda,'' Kongolo said. ``This war
started in Rwanda and it is going to end in Rwanda.''
	   Mumenge described Rwanda as a criminal state that had meddled in
foreign affairs while drawing on ``a feeling of pity by the
international community'' since the 1994 Rwandan genocide.
	   He was referring to the ethnic slaughter of more than half a
million people, mainly Tutsis, by Rwandan Hutu soldiers and
militants who were subsequently driven into hiding, from where they
have attacked Rwanda's Tutsi-led government.
	   The rebellion has sparked a backlash of anger by some residents
in Congo's capital of Kinshasa against Congolese Tutsis believed to
be receiving support from Rwanda.
	   About 5,000 supporters of the ruling party chanted and sang as
they marched through the streets of Kinshasa on Thursday, calling
for guns to join the fight against ``the Rwandan invaders.''
	   The marchers carried stuffed effigies of two former members of
Kabila's inner circle _ both Tutsis _ who have apparently defected
to the rebels.
	   The two are Kabila's former confidante Deogratias Bugera, a
senior government advisor who disappeared from the capital last
week and former foreign minister Bizima Karaha, who was said to be
in the eastern town of Goma with rebels who had captured the town.
	   The demonstrators, led by two popular musicians, planned to chop
off the heads of the effigies before the protest ends.
	   Several Kinshasa businesses owned by Tutsis were reportedly
robbed and burned Wednesday by local residents after a dusk-to-dawn
curfew was lifted.
	   The rebels are believed to include Banyamulenge _ Congolese
Tutsi fighters _ and Rwandan soldiers who remained in Congo after
playing a key role in Kabila's victory over longtime Zairian
dictator Mobutu Sese Seko last year.
	   The mutineers were advancing from east to west in a manner
eerily reminiscent of the early days of Kabila's eight-month march
to power that ended with Mobutu's ouster.
	   By Wednesday the key cities of Bukavu and Goma near Rwanda's
border had been seized by the rebels and fighting continued in the
city of Kisangani further into the interior, government and rebel
sources said.
	   A source in Uvira south of Bukavu, said that town had also
fallen to the rebels while fighting continued further into the
interior inn Kisangani on Thursday, some aid workers told the U.N.
Integrated Regional Integrated Network.

Zambia accuses UNITA of defying peace accord
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   LUSAKA, Zambia (AP) _ President Frederick Chiluba has accused
Angola's former rebels of defying the 1994 peace accord that was
signed in Lusaka and intended to end two decades of civil war.
	   Chiluba appealed Wednesday night to UNITA, the former rebel
movement, to support current United Nations mediation to restore
peace in the former Portuguese colony.
	   UNITA _ the Portuguese acronym for the National Union for the
Total Independence of Angola _ has refused to demobilize and take
its elected seats in the government.
	   Clashes with government troops have increased dramatically in
recent weeks.
	   ``We in Zambia are deeply concerned with these sad developments
on the continent of Africa,'' said Chiluba, whose country shares
Angola's eastern border.
	   A Zambian government spokesman Thursday denied reports that
Zambia was supporting UNITA.
	   Richard Sakala referred to findings by teams from United Nations
and the Organization for African Unity that exonerated Zambia from
the allegations.

Fighters blank Daiei 11-0 on Wilson's three homers
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ Nigel Wilson drove in eight runs with homers in his
first three at-bats Thursday, leading the Pacific League's
front-running Nippon Ham Fighters to an 11-0 victory over the
Fukuoka Daiei Hawks at Kitakyushu.
	   Wilson slugged three-run homers in the first and second innings
and a two-run homer in the fourth.
	   That gave the former Cleveland Indians player 24 homers for the
season and a tie for the league lead with teammate Jerry Brooks,
formerly with the Florida Marlins.
	   Masaru Imazeki limited the Hawks to seven scattered hits and
struck out 10 for his sixth victory against three defeats.
	   The victory increased the Fighters' lead over the second-place
Kintetsu Buffaloes to 7 1/2 games as the Seibu Lions beat the
Buffaloes 6-2 at Osaka Dome.
	   The Lions' Norio Tanabe singled home one run in the second
inning and two more in the three-run third.
	   A scheduled game between the Chiba Lotte Marines and the Orix
BlueWave at Chiba was rained out.
	   In the Central League, Robert Rose hit his second homer of the
game, a three-run shot, in the bottom of the 14th inning, giving
the front-running Yokohama BayStars a 12-9 victory over the Hanshin
Tigers at Yokohama.
	   Rose also hit a three-run home run in the fifth. Rose, formerly
with the California Angels, has 13 homers.
	   The two teams played five scoreless innings after the Tigers
tied the game 9-9 in the eighth on former Chicago Cubs player Dave
Hansen's sacrifice fly.
	   The BayStars are four games ahead of the second-place Chunichi
Dragons, who ended their winning streak at four, losing to the
Yakult Swallows 4-2 in 11 innings at Nagoya Dome.
	   In the top of the 11th, the Swallows' Kouta Soejima doubled home
two runs.
	   The Dragons had tied the game 2-2 in the seventh on former
Chicago Cubs player Leo Gomez's one-run double and a wild pitch by
Hiroaki Hirota.
	   At Tokyo Dome, Yasuyuki Yamauchi pitched a five-hitter and
Tomonori Maeda hit a two-run home run as the Hiroshima Toyo Carp
beat the Yomiuri Giants 5-1.
	   Yamauchi is 2-5 and Maeda has 16 homers.

<TEXT>
	   LAUSANNE, Switzerland (AP) _ Irish swimmer Michelle Smith,
winner of three gold medals at the 1996 Atlanta Olympics, was
banned for four years Thursday after the sport's governing body
determined she tampered with a urine sample.
	   The decision was announced by the international swimming
federation (FINA), 13 days after a hearing by its doping panel.
	   The suspension goes into effect immediately, FINA said.
	   Smith's lawyer, Peter Lennon, said he would not comment on the
ruling until a news conference in Dublin on Friday. Lennon has
previously said he would appeal to a higher court if Smith was
found guilty.

Havel's crisis may be over, doctors say

 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   PRAGUE, Czech Republic (AP) _ President Vaclav Havel remained on
a respirator Thursday, but doctors said his bout with pneumonia was
taking a positive turn.
	   ``The president had no fever today and his heart's function is
regular,'' said Miroslav Cerbak, the head of Havel's medical team.
	   According to Cerbak, X-rays showed pneumonia receding and
despite the use of a ventilator the president's ability to breathe
independently was improving.
	   ``The new type of antibiotics seems to work,'' said Boris
Stastny, a lung specialist on the team. ``I feel the crisis is
over.''
	   The Czech leader suffered a ruptured colon in April while
vacationing in the Austrian Alps. He underwent emergency surgery
and a colostomy was performed.
	   On July 26, a combined Austrian-Czech team of doctors in Prague
closed the colostomy. Havel developed pneumonia related to the
operation on Monday.
	   Ernst Bodner of the Innsbruck University Clinic confirmed
Thursday he took out the last stitches and declared the closed
colostomy a success.
	   ``There is no need for me here any more, and I can return home
now,'' said Bodner, who performed both operations.
	   In all of Havel's previous surgeries, breathing problems and
infections often leading to pneumonia hindered the president's
recovery.
	   He has been hospitalized five times since December 1996 when a
third of his lung and a cancerous tumor were removed.
	   On Tuesday, Havel's condition worsened to the point where his
heart rate soared to 200 beats per minute and doctors had to
stabilize his condition with electric shocks.
	   Havel, a former chain smoker and veteran of communist jails, has
suffered from chronic bronchitis for years.

<TEXT>
	   AMSTERDAM, Netherlands (AP) _ Hit by low oil prices and Asia's
economic crisis, the Royal Dutch Shell Group of Cos. said Thursday
its net income fell 17 percent to dlrs 1.6 billion in the second
quarter.
	   Earnings for the three months ended June 30 were at the lower
end of the dlrs 1.6 billion to dlrs 1.8 billion range forecast by
analysts. In the same period a year ago, the Anglo-Dutch giant
posted a profit of dlrs 1.9 billion.
	   Shares of Shell, one of the world's biggest energy companies,

Death toll tops 2,000 in China's summer floods
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: RECASTS, UPDATES with more details on damage in graf 5, other

<TEXT>
	   BEIJING (AP) _ China's government said Thursday it was
considering the last-ditch step of breaking open dikes along the
raging Yangtze River to protect areas downstream, as the death toll
from the devastating summer flood season passed 2,000.
	   The decision on whether to safeguard some areas by inundating
others could come as early as Friday, when a flood tide surging
down the river approaches a major embankment already weakened by
weeks of floods and rain, officials said.
	   While officials said they believed such a step would prove
unnecessary, that they were considering it was an indication of the
pressures wrought by the heaviest flooding along the Yangtze since
floods in 1954 killed more than 30,000 people.
	   The figure of more than 2,000 dead in this year's summer flood
season, announced at a government news conference Thursday, was 700
higher than previous figures. The floods have affected 240 million
people, or a fifth of the population, to varying degrees, said Fan
Baojun, vice minister of civil affairs.
	   About 90 percent of those killed died in mountain floods,
landslides and mudflows that swallowed houses and villages, he
said. Nearly 14 million people have been evacuated, and 5.58
million houses have been destroyed, with another 12 million houses
damaged, he said.
	   Main embankments that hem in the Yangtze, the world's
third-longest river, so far have held firm, protecting millions of
people and rich farmland from its waters.
	   But a flood peak _ the fourth to barrel down the river so far
this year _ was expected to reach the weakened Jingjiang dike in
central China's flood-hit Hubei province within the next two days,
raising the question of whether to flood an area south of the dike
to protect the levee itself and other areas downstream.
	   ``The possibility of flood diversion cannot be discounted,''
said Zhao Chunming, a deputy director at the State Flood Control
and Drought Relief Headquarters. ``Preparations have already been
made.''
	   ``We will try our best not to divert water unless it is
absolutely necessary,'' he added.
	   Other officials at the news conference, however, hastily sought
to qualify Zhao's remarks.
	   ``According to the situation now, it doesn't look like we need
to divert water,'' Zhou Wenzhi, a vice minister of water resources,
said. ``But we have to make these preparations.''
	   Water levels at Hubei's Shashi city, near the dike, were at a
record high, state-run media reported. Zhou said the Yangtze at
Shashi could reach heights Friday that would enable the State
Council, or Cabinet, to approve flood diversion.
	   While main Yangtze dikes have held firm, secondary levees have
collapsed, inundating swathes of farmland. Some were deliberately
abandoned to take the pressure off major levees, said Zhao. Other
secondary dikes could also be abandoned if main Yangzte dikes are
endangered, he said.
	   Hubei, among the worst hit provinces, declared a state of
emergency Thursday, the official Xinhua News Agency reported. It
said that with water levels expected to rise further, provincial
authorities issued a ``do or die'' order to local residents to help
safeguard major cities and levees.
	   Rains in parts of Hubei and neighboring Jiangxi province in July
were seven times heavier than normal. Flooding has also caused
serious damage in northeastern China, in central Shaanxi province,
and in southern Guangdong and Guangxi.
	   On Wednesday, two days after the end of the period covered by
the latest death toll, a levee that protected 35,000 people near
Jiujiang city, along the Yangtze in southeast China, gave way, but
officials said Thursday there were no reports of casualties.
	   But the bodies of 13 people were recovered in Jiayu, a county
upstream where a levee collapsed Saturday, the official Hubei Daily
reported. Nineteen soldiers swept away when the dike burst were
missing, the official China Daily added.
	   After weeks of rain, dikes along the Yangtze are saturated and
threaten to give way at any time in thousands of places. Millions
of residents and soldiers patrol around the clock, on the lookout
for cracks or signs of weakness. Neck deep in water, they plug
holes and shore up the levees with sandbags, stones and wooden
stakes in anticipation of several more weeks of battle with the
river.

Offensives undermine efforts to track down missing in Kosovo
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   PRISTINA, Yugoslavia (AP) _ Family members of more than 100
Serbs presumed kidnapped by ethnic Albanians in Kosovo met Friday
with U.S. and Red Cross officials, demanding help to get their
relatives released or at least accounted for.
	   Beatrix Weber, of the International Committee of Red Cross
office in Pristina, said the organization is actively working on
cases of 40 missing Serbs, presumed abducted by Kosovo Albanian
guerrillas, out of a registered total of 138.
	   But Weber said the ongoing Serb government crackdown against the
independence-seeking guerrillas has seriously affected the efforts
and diminished chances for release.
	   Andjelko Kolasinac, head of Orahovac municipality in central
Kosovo where some of the worst fighting recently ended with many
missing on both sides, said after meeting U.S. representatives in
Pristina that they got assurances that Western officials dealing
with the crisis would try through diplomatic channels to help get
the Serbs released.
	   Weber said that ICRC lists of missing since fighting escalated
earlier this year include 400 Kosovo Albanians, but she advised
``utmost caution'' regarding the number as it was still being
checked.

 &UR; Kohl's government welcomes report of economic upswing in Germany &QL; 
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES throughout with political reaction &QL; 
 &UR; By COLLEEN BARRY &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   FRANKFURT, Germany (AP) _ With September elections likely to
turn on the state of the economy, Chancellor Helmut Kohl's
government on Thursday welcomed a report projecting an economic
upswing and new jobless figures indicating a favorable shift in the
employment market.
	   The Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development
forecast growth of 2.75 percent in 1998 and 3 percent in 1999, in
line with the German government's forecasts.
	   ``The report shows that Germany's economic and fiscal policy is
on the right track,'' Finance Minister Theo Waigel said in a
statement.
	   Separately, the Federal Labor Office reported that the number of
Germans without work rose slightly in July but the increase was
less than in previous years, signaling an improvement in the jobs
market.
	   The unemployment rate rose to 10.7 percent, or 4.13 million, in
July, from 10.5 percent a month earlier.
	   The increase was due entirely to seasonal factors, Labor Office
vice president Klaus Leven said, meaning that the jobs picture
overall in Germany was showing signs of improvement.
	   Kohl's Christian Democrats were quick to interpret the figures
as further evidence that the government's jobs creation policies
were taking hold.
	   ``The difficult path to structural adaptations, holding back
salaries, spending discipline and modern work policies have paid
off,'' said CDU party secretary Peter Hitze.
	   The opposition Social Democrats, however, disputed the
government's contention that the figures signaled recovery in the
employment market. ``No one can say all's clear,'' said the party's
employment expert, Ottmar Schreiner.
	   Schreiner said a more comprehensive jobs creation package,
including tax reform to improve workers' buying power, was needed
for a full recovery.

Low oil prices, Asia crisis cause 17 percent profit drop
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   AMSTERDAM, Netherlands (AP) _ Hit by low oil prices and Asia's
economic crisis, the Royal Dutch Shell Group of Cos. on Thursday
said its net income fell 17 percent to dlrs 1.6 billion in the
second quarter.
	   Earnings for the three months ended June 30 were at the lower
end of the dlrs 1.6 billion to dlrs 1.8 billion range forecast by
analysts. In the same period a year ago, the Anglo-Dutch giant
posted a profit of dlrs 1.9 billion.
	   Shares of Shell, one of the world's biggest energy companies,
were trading down 8.4 percent by midafternoon Thursday on the
London Stock Exchange.
	   The 26 percent fall in crude oil prices adversely affected
exploration and production earnings despite a 4 percent rise in
output from second quarter 1997 levels, Shell said. Gas sales were
lower mainly due to warmer weather in Europe.
	   Shell said the outlook for oil prices depends on whether members
of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries follow through
on their June agreement to cut output.
	   Sales of oil products rose 1 percent, but earnings were offset
in part by Asia's economic turmoil, Shell said.
	   ``The outlook for Asia-Pacific refining margins is one of
continued weakness,'' it said. U.S. and European refining margins
should remain steady unless the effects of the Asian economic
slowdown filters through more strongly into Western markets, Shell
added.
	   Chemicals volumes increased, but those earnings also fell due to
reduced demand in Asia and increased industry supply. ``Globally,
the outlook for the second half of the year is for further
deterioration,'' Shell said.
	   Shell's total second quarter sales fell to dlrs 34.7 billion
from dlrs 41.8 billion a year ago. First-half sales fell to dlrs
70.5 billion from dlrs 86.5 billion in the previous year, while
first-half net income fell to dlrs 3.5 billion from dlrs 4.4
billion.
	   Shell does not announce its interim dividend until Sept. 10.

Former generals, Cabinet ministers pledge fight for more democracy
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with Megawati's remark, party meeting, last 5 grafs &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   JAKARTA, Indonesia (AP) _ A group of retired generals, former
Cabinet ministers and senior politicians pledged Thursday to
struggle for more democracy in Indonesia.
	   The group, calling itself ``Barisan Nasional,'' or national
front, declared that a major aim would be to weaken the influence
of the ruling Golkar party in the government.
	   ``If the domination of Golkar could be decreased, then the
sovereignty will practically be back to the people,'' said Kemal
Idris, a retired army lieutenant general who chairs the front.
	   He told reporters after a ceremony inaugurating the front that
the government under new President B.J. Habibie was not much
different than its predecessor.
	   Habibie, then vice president, became the head of government
after Suharto quit on May 21 amid violence and widespread protests
against his 32-year authoritarian rule.
	   Suharto, a retired army general, took power in 1966 from
founding President Sukarno and ruled the country with an iron hand
with support from Golkar and the military.
	   Habibie has promised reforms, but many critics view most of his
policies as continuations of Suharto's.
	   Idris said the forum will monitor all actions of Habibie.
	   ``We will support all political parties fighting for total
reform, and we insist not to support Golkar,'' Idris said, adding
that the forum has no intention to turn into a political party.
	   Its secretary-general is Subroto, a former minister of mines and
energy and former secretary-general of the Organization of
Petroleum Exporting Countries.
	   Also joining the forum was retired army general Edy Sudradjat,
who lost the race for the Golkar chairmanship last month to State
Secretary Akbar Tandjung.
	   Besides more than 10 retired generals, the forum also was
supported by two former Parliament speakers, a number of former
Golkar executives and former Cabinet ministers under Suharto.
	   Pro-democracy leader Megawati Sukarnoputri, who also attended
the gathering, said later the new government has not yet fully met
the people's demand for total reforms.
	   ``The reforms so far just touch on the skin. The clear evidence
is the legal system,'' Megawati said in her opening speech at the
first national conference of her unrecognized faction of the
Indonesian Democratic Party.
	   Megawati, the eldest daughter of Sukarno, was deposed as leader
of the Christian-nationalist coalition, one of only three political
groups allowed by Suharto, in a rebel party congress supported by
the military in 1996.
	   She sued the government and the military as well as rival party
officials but the Supreme Court so far has not ruled on the case.
	   Several hundred regional party representatives attended the
conference in a hotel in eastern Jakarta outskirts. It was the
first time Indonesian police had permitted her faction to hold such
a gathering.

International cycling body meets to discuss doping scandal

<TEXT>
	   PARIS (AP) _ Top officials from cycling's governing body met
Thursday for the first time since the scandal-plagued Tour de
France to discuss the sport's growing drug crisis.
	   The Tour de France, which ended Sunday, was dominated by
revelations of drug-taking among top cyclists.
	   The Festina team was thrown out of the race and six more teams
withdrew protesting police investigations.
	   The International Cycling Union (UCI) met in Paris ``to
elaborate a number of way to fight (doping) more efficiently,''
said the UCI.
	   UCI President Hein Verbruggen and vice presidents Agostino Omini
and Daniel Baal attended the meeting, along with Jean-Marie
Leblanc, president of the international association of cycling tour
organizers (AIOCC) and director of the company that organizes the
Tour de France.
	   Representatives from the International Association of
Professional Cyclists are expected to meet with UCI officials late
Thursday.
	   UCI officials didn't take any decisions at the Paris gathering
but have convened a second meeting in Lausanne early next week that
Tour de France winner Marco Pantani is expected to attend, along
with cyclists Erik Zabel, Michael Boogerd and Luc Leblanc.
	   On Wednesday of next week, the UCI will likely provide details
of the meetings and announce new strategies to combat doping, said
a UCI official who requested anonymity.

U.N. weapons chief softens tone, says `creative' solutions needed

with Iraq &QL; 
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with Richardson comments in grafs 13, 14; TRIMS &QL; 
 &UR; By RON KAMPEAS &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   UNITED NATIONS (AP) _ Already facing an Iraqi freeze in
cooperation, the chief U.N. weapons inspector will find little
consolation when he meets with the Security Council.
	   Richard Butler blames the Iraqis for the breakdown in talks this
week that led President Saddam Hussein on Thursday to block
inspectors from carrying out searches for banned weapons in
Baghdad. Saddam declared a freeze Wednesday on dealings with the
inspectors.
	   But some members of the powerful U.N. Security Council, eager to
end eight years of sanctions on Iraq, will likely blame Butler when
the chief inspector briefs them on Thursday.
	   ``We are strongly convinced that Iraq is not the only one to
blame for this situation,'' Yuriy Fedotov, Russia's No. 2 man at
the United Nations, said after a council meeting Wednesday.
	   He said Butler stopped the talks Monday without consulting his
bosses in New York _ the council and Secretary-General Kofi Annan.
	   Butler strongly denied that, saying Iraqi Deputy Prime Minister
Tariq Aziz ended the talks when Butler refused to declare the
Iraqis in full compliance with the inspection program.
	   ``What is at issue here is the decisions of the Security Council
which are binding in international law,'' Butler said before
meeting with Annan on Wednesday ``Whether or not Iraq is prepared
to accept that law is what is at issue.''
	   Iraq has been trying to get international sanctions lifted. The
sanctions, imposed after Iraq invaded Kuwait in 1990, cannot be
lifted by the council until the U.N. inspectors certify Iraq has
destroyed all its chemical and biological weapons and long-range
missiles. The sanctions ban Iraq from freely exporting its most
valuable commodity _ oil.
	   In Baghdad on Thursday, an inspection team was stopped when it
tried to search suspected weapons sites. The United States had
downplayed Saddam's declaration Wednesday of a freeze on
cooperation, saying it would wait to see what happened when
inspectors tried to continue their work.
	   Russia, along with France, want to accelerate the end of
sanctions. Both countries have financial interests in Iraq.
	   Over the years, Fedotov said, Iraq has cooperated in dismantling
many of its illegal weapons.
	   ``Unfortunately, there have been no real positive moves from the
Security Council, from the U.N., to recognize these achievements,''
Fedotov said.
	   On Thursday, however, U.S. Ambassador Bill Richardson went into
the Security Council to hear Butler's report saying he was
confident Butler had the backing of the council.
	   ``They're trying to divide the Security Council,'' he said of
Iraq. ``What is happening is a more united Security Council in
responding to these threats.''
	   In a 38-page letter to the Council, Aziz accused the inspectors
of raising trivial matters _ a ploy, he said, to extend the
sanctions and to please the United States and Britain.
	   Butler could expect little backing from Annan, who brokered a
February agreement that averted the war and has invested much
political capital in ensuring the agreement's success.
	   Butler emerged from an hour-long meeting with his boss Wednesday
looking chastened and speaking of ``creative'' solutions to end
Iraq's ``worrying'' sanctions _ unusual diplomatic language for the
technician.
	   Annan postponed a trip to Portugal so he could attend the
Security Council meeting, reflecting the seriousness he attaches to
the latest impasse.
	   Butler said he found Aziz's stance puzzling because the
commission is close to saying Iraq has no weapons of mass
destruction in some areas.
	   He said Aziz continued to refuse to hand over a document found
last month by U.N. weapons inspectors, detailing types of bombs and
rockets that Iraq has said were used to deliver chemical and
biological agents.
	   ``Tariq Aziz refused to give it to me and said `you will never
get it.'''

Canadian player detained after scooter accident

<TEXT>
	   ATHENS, Greece (AP) _ Coast guard officers released Canada's
William Njoku on Thursday after he was arrested following an
accident with a rented moped during an day off in the World
Basketball Championship.
	   According to FIBA tournament organizers, the 26-year-old guard
got into an accident Wednesday on the island of Aegina, just off
the coast of Athens.
	   The 2.06-meter (6-foot-10) Njoku was visiting Aegina on a day
off from the championship. Although he did not have enough money to
pay for the damage to the scooter, Njoku left an identity card and
drivers license and promised to take care of the bill.
	   But according to organizers, the rental agency filed a lawsuit
against Njoku as soon as he left the island aboard a ferry. The
Ghana-born Njoku was arrested by the coast guard when he arrived at
the port of Piraeus.
	   According to organizers, he was released early Thursday after
the lawsuit was withdrawn.
	   Njoku was the 1993 Canadian college player of the year for St.
Mary's. Although the Indiana Pacers selected him in the second
round of the 1994 draft, he has never played in the NBA.
	   Canada went 1-5 in the preliminary rounds and was eliminated
from medal contention. The country faces Australia on Friday in
consolation play.

	   KINSHASA, Congo (AP) _ Embattled by a widening rebellion in
eastern Congo, President Laurent Kabila's government threatened
Thursday to wage war against neighboring Rwanda, which it accused
of masterminding the uprising.
	   Government spokesman Didier Mumenge warned that Congo would
``extend the war into Rwanda'' unless the international community
pressured the tiny country to withdraw Rwandan troops allegedly
deployed in Congo.
	   Congo's Justice Minister Mwenze Kongolo also pledged in an
interview with CNN International to retaliate against Rwanda.
	   ``We are moving back to Rwanda,'' Kongolo said. ``This war
started in Rwanda and it is going to end in Rwanda.''
	   Mumenge described Rwanda as a criminal state that had meddled in
foreign affairs while drawing on ``a feeling of pity by the
international community'' since the 1994 Rwandan genocide.
	   He was referring to the ethnic slaughter of more than half a
million people, mainly Tutsis, by Rwandan Hutu soldiers and
militants who were subsequently driven into hiding, from where they
have attacked Rwanda's Tutsi-led government.
	   The rebellion has sparked a backlash of anger by some residents
in Congo's capital of Kinshasa against Congolese Tutsis believed to
be receiving support from Rwanda.
	   About 5,000 supporters of the ruling party chanted and sang as
they marched through the streets of Kinshasa on Thursday, calling
for guns to join the fight against ``the Rwandan invaders.''
	   The marchers carried stuffed effigies of two former members of
Kabila's inner circle _ both Tutsis _ who have apparently defected
to the rebels.
	   The two are Kabila's former confidante Deogratias Bugera, a
senior government advisor who disappeared from the capital last
week and former foreign minister Bizima Karaha, who was said to be
in the eastern town of Goma with rebels who had captured the town.
	   The demonstrators, led by two popular musicians, planned to chop
off the heads of the effigies before the protest ends.
	   Several Kinshasa businesses owned by Tutsis were reportedly
robbed and burned Wednesday by local residents after a dusk-to-dawn
curfew was lifted.
	   The rebels are believed to include Banyamulenge _ Congolese
Tutsi fighters _ and Rwandan soldiers who remained in Congo after
playing a key role in Kabila's victory over longtime Zairian
dictator Mobutu Sese Seko last year.
	   The mutineers were advancing from east to west in a manner
eerily reminiscent of the early days of Kabila's eight-month march
to power that ended with Mobutu's ouster.
	   By Wednesday the key cities of Bukavu and Goma near Rwanda's
border had been seized by the rebels and fighting continued in the
city of Kisangani further into the interior, government and rebel
sources said.
	   A source in Uvira south of Bukavu, said that town had also
fallen to the rebels while fighting continued further into the
interior inn Kisangani on Thursday, some aid workers told the U.N.
Integrated Regional Information Network.

Iraq steps up pressure on U.N. weapons inspectors
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: RECASTS for AMs; UPDATES with British, French comments &QL; 
 &UR; By LEON BARKHO &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   BAGHDAD, Iraq (AP) _ Making good on its threat to limit arms
inspections, Iraq Thursday banned surprise checks by the U.N.
nuclear agency and told weapons inspectors they can only monitor
sites already checked.
	   The moves follow President Saddam Hussein's decision Wednesday
to freeze cooperation with U.N. weapons inspectors and the
International Atomic Energy Agency. The development threatens to
renew a dispute that nearly started a war six months ago with the
United States and Britain.
	   An IAEA spokesman said the organization has been told it can no
longer carry out surprise inspections of Iraq's nearly defunct
nuclear program.
	   ``We have been told by the government of Iraq that our
activities will be limited to certain declared sites. This is not
acceptable and we are contacting the president of the Security
Council,'' the spokesman, David Kyd, said in Vienna, Austria.
	   In another defiant step, Iraqi escorts refused to accompany a
team of weapons experts from the United Nations Special Commission,
forcing them to abandon their planned searches Thursday, a
government official told The Associated Press.
	   The weapons teams cannot work without escorts under a United
Nations agreements with Iraq.
	   The UNSCOM team was not allowed to conduct ``discussions with
Iraqi authorities on arms or visits to sites or searches for past
weapons,'' the official said, on condition of anonymity.
	   The Iraqi News Agency denied any team was blocked from working,
but did not mention if escorts were refused to the inspectors. U.N.
officials refused to comment on whether any inspectors were kept
from doing their jobs.
	   The reaction to Saddam's latest move has been muted compared to
threats of military action by the United States and Britain during
a previous crisis over arms inspections last winter.
	   U.S. officials have said they would withhold a full response
until after chief U.N. weapons inspector Richard Butler briefs the
Security Council later Thursday.
	   In London, British Foreign Secretary Robin Cook said Iraq must
fulfill its obligations to the United Nations. ``This latest move
will only delay the moment when the Security Council can consider
the removal of sanctions,'' he said.
	   Britain has been a staunch opponent of relaxing U.N. sanctions
on Iraq. France _ another permanent Security Council member that
has sought to ease the strictures _ said Saddam's declaration of
non-cooperation was ``unacceptable.''
	   ``France asks Iraq not to implement its decision,'' a French
Foreign Ministry statement said.
	   Saddam took the confrontational stand after Butler refused
Monday to provide an immediate certification that Iraq has
destroyed all its weapons of mass destruction _ chemical and
biological arms and long-range missiles.
	   Such a testimonial by UNSCOM is necessary before the Security
Council will lift economic sanctions imposed in 1990 after Iraq's
invasion of Kuwait.
	   Butler has said that he was close to giving a thumbs up on
Iraq's chemical and missile programs but needed more information on
biological weapons.
	   Saddam's Wednesday directive allows weapons experts to continue
monitoring activities.
	   While inspections tend to be surprise visits of suspected
weapons sites, monitoring is an ongoing process and includes repeat
visits to places already checked and keeping an eye through cameras
installed at sites.
	   On Thursday, convoys of U.N. vehicles carrying some monitoring
officials left the U.N. headquarters on Baghdad's eastern outskirts
followed by cars with Iraqi officials. No one interfered with their
work.
	   ``Ongoing monitoring continues,'' U.N. spokesman Janet Sullivan
told the AP.
	   About 460 sites in Iraq have been inspected and are under
monitoring. About 100 U.N. experts visit the sites or use
remote-controlled cameras and sensors.
	   Saddam's non-cooperation stand is his most aggressive step since
he made his palaces off-limits to weapons inspectors late last
year. The crisis was resolved in February, averting a possible U.S.
and British military strike.
	   Last month, Saddam demanded that the sanctions be lifted by the
end of this year, the first time he set a deadline.
	   That and the latest developments reflect the growing
frustrations in Iraq with the eight-year-old sanctions, which have
crippled the economy by banning the free sale of oil, the country's
largest revenue earner.

	   YEREVAN, Armenia (AP) _ Armenia's prosecutor general was shot to
death in his office Thursday, apparently by a fellow prosecutor who
then committed suicide, a top law enforcement official said.
	   Genrikh Khachatrian was slain late Thursday afternoon, shortly
after leaving a government meeting in the capital and promising to
return a short time later.
	   A high-ranking Interior Ministry official, speaking on condition
of anonymity, said Khachatrian was believed to have been killed by
another prosecutor, Aram Karapetian, who then committed suicide in
the same office.
	   Karapetian was said to have been a friend of Khachatrian until a
recent falling-out.
	   Khachatrian, 59, had been prosecutor general for a little more
than a year. He previously was a member of Armenia's Constitutional
Court.
	   President Robert Kocharian was expected to speak about the
killing on national television later Thursday.

Britain urges its citizens to leave Congo
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; With BC-Congo &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ Britain on Thursday urged its citizens to leave
the Congo because of the risk of a serious escalation in fighting
between government troops and armed insurgents.
	   ``We hope that the current tensions can be resolved quickly and
peacefully,'' the Foreign Office said.
	   It urged the Congo and its neighbors to continue to cooperate in
efforts to deal with threats to regional security and expressed
hope that a regional summit in Victoria Falls, Zimbabwe, on Aug.
7-9 ``will help promote a peaceful resolution to the current
crisis.''
	   Embattled by a widening rebellion in eastern Congo, President
Laurent Kabila's government threatened Thursday to wage war against
neighboring Rwanda, which it accused of masterminding the uprising.
	   Rwanda's President Pasteur Bizimungu denied Wednesday his
country was involved in the conflict, but was noncommittal about
the likelihood of future intervention. Britain welcomed Rwanda's
statement that it had complied with Kinshasa's request to the U.N.
Security Council that foreign troops be withdrawn from the country.
	   But the Foreign Office called the military situation ``unstable
and unpredictable,'' noting reports of fighting in Bukavu and Uvira
in eastern Congo and of military activity in Binza and Kisangani, a
major eastern city. It said the situation in eastern Kivu remains
unclear, but rebels were reported to have taken Kitena and Muenda
military bases.
	   ``In view of the uncertainty and the risk of serious escalation
in the fighting, we strongly advise against travel to the
Democratic Republic of the Congo, and advise British nationals in
the DRC to leave while commercial flights are still operation,''
the Foreign Office said in a statement.
	   ``Evacuation by other means cannot be guaranteed if these
services cease,'' it said, adding that the British Embassy was able
to offer only very limited assistance.
	   Up to 400 British nationals are registered as residents with the
British Embassy in Kinshasa. Most are businessmen, aid workers and
missionaries.

High administrative court upholds ban on National List
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BERLIN (AP) _ Germany's highest administrative court on Thursday
upheld a ban on the extreme right-wing organization National List.
	   The National List was founded in Hamburg in 1989, and fielded
candidates in two city elections. Hamburg officials banned the
group in 1995 after the federal Constitutional Court ruled that it
was not a political party.
	   Several challenges to the ban were previously rejected by the
Hamburg administrative court on the grounds that the group showed
tendencies of National Socialism, or the Nazi party.

Argentine striker extends contract with Fiorentina
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with managing director comment on new contract &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   FLORENCE, Italy (AP) _ Argentine striker Gabriel Batistuta,
giving up his long-announced transfer plans, on Thursday extended
his contract with Italian first-division Fiorentina through 2003.
	   Fiorentina officials said a new contract was signed following a
final round of talks with the player and his agent Settimio Aloisio
in the headquarters of the Florentine club.
	   Fiorentina did not immediately announce terms of Batistuta's new
contract.
	   However Luciano Luna, managing director of the Florentine club,
denied reports it may contain a rescission clause, so that the
player could decide to leave before contract expiration.
	   ``It's a final agreement. There is no rescission clause in the
new contract,'' Luna said.
	   ``Everything has been settled, but it was not easy to reach an
agreement,'' Batistuta told the ANSA news agency. ``All problems
have been resolved.''
	   ``Gabriel knows he's going to stay with a great team, with a
great coach,'' Luna added.
	   The 29-year-old Argentine star, one of the leading strikers in
the recent World Cup, had repeatedly said before and during France
'98 that he wanted to leave Fiorentina and experience new
challenges with another club.
	   Parma and AS Roma had been bidding for the striker nicknamed
``Batigoal'' by Florentine fans.
	   Movie tycoon Vittorio Cecchi Gori, Fiorentina's president, and
newly-signed coach Giovanni Trapattoni had strongly opposed
Batistuta's transfer.
	   Batistuta, formerly of Boca Juniors, has been playing with
Fiorentina since he transferred to Italy in 1991.
	   Fiorentina officials will have now to deal with Edmundo, the
Brazilian forward who wants to part from the Florentine club after
signing a four-year contract last year.

	   LONDON (AP) _ Arsenal and Manchester United, the two English
clubs which have admitted taking part in talks to set up a European
Super League, meet Sunday in English soccer's traditional season
opener, the Charity Shield.
	   The Gunners and Reds issued similarly worded statements that
they had been involved in discussions about future European
competitions while at the same time saying they were totally
committed to existing league and cup programs.
	   Their admissions on Wednesday have added more fuel to
speculation that a breakaway league is on its way and the subject
is being debated across the nation as a new season is about to
start.
	   England's two clubs in this season's Champions League, Arsenal
and United would have much to gain from a lucrative Super League
with its massive revenue from TV rights and sponsorship. Their
absence would severely weaken domestic competitions.
	   The two soccer giants are the main contenders for the Premier
League title once again.
	   They are rated co-favorites at 2-1 by bookmakers Ladbrokes even
though 4-1 shot Chelsea has recruited World Cup stars Marcel
Desailly, Brian Laudrup and Alberto Ferrer along with Italian
striker Pierluigi Casiraghi. Liverpool, a 7-1 contender, has hired
Germany's Sean Dundee and recalled Ireland's Steve Staunton and now
has French coach Gerard Houllier at the helm alongside Roy Evans.
	   Although the game at Wembley is effectively a warmup to the
Premier League campaign, which starts a week later, Alex Ferguson's
United has plenty to prove.
	   More concerned about winning the European Champions Cup, his
team squandered a 12-point lead in the Premier League last season
and eventually lost out to Arsenal. It also lost to Monaco in the
quarterfinal of the Champions Cup and wound up with no title at all
after four championships in five years.
	   Two World Cup players imported during the summer are likely to
face each other at Wembley.
	   Nelson Vivas, who was on the Argentina lineup that ousted
England in the second round, could be on the Arsenal defense having
signed on Thursday while the Reds are expected to field Dutch
defender Jaap Stam.
	   But United's other off-season signing, Sweden's Jesper
Bromqvist, misses the game because of a lingering ankle injury
which also may keep him out of the Aug. 15 Premier League opener
against Leicester.
	   Although Arsenal has been linked with other big-name players,
such as Dutch stars Ronald de Boer of Ajax and AC Milan's Patrick
Kluivert, Vivas is the only major import by manager Arsene Wenger.
	   Ferguson also tried to get Kluivert and agreed a price with AC
Milan but the striker prefered to stay in Italy. Cameroon
midfielder Marc Vivien Foe was another target but broke his leg
just before the World Cup and Ferguson also is after Aston Villa's
Tobagan striker Dwight Yorke.
	   Otherwise, most of the players who face each other at Wembley
will be those who were involved in the title race last term.
	   Arsenal's World Cup stars, Emmanuel Petit and Patrick Vieira of
title-winner France and Dennis Bergkamp and Marc Overmars of fourth
place Netherlands are back after a post-tournament break and should
play some part of Sunday's game.
	   Stam is expected to take the place of central defender Gary
Pallister, who has returned to Middlesbrough, and United also
welcomes back tough-tackling Irish midfielder Roy Keane, who missed
most of last season because of a knee injury.
	   England midfielder David Beckham, who is still being blamed for
England's World Cup exit after being needlessly sent off against
Argentina, is unlikely to face the Gunners.
	   The midfielder, who is set to receive a hostile reception from
non-United fans wherever he goes in England, collected an ankle
injury playing in a warmup game in Norway on Monday. With a
Champions Cup qualifying game against LKS Lodz coming up on
Wednesday, Ferguson doesn't want to risk his fitness.
	   Divisions one, two and three of the English league kick off
Saturday with Crystal Palace and Bolton, two clubs relegated from
the Premier League last season, meeting at Selhurst Park.
	   Palace, which is now is being led by former England coach Terry
Venables, has jumped between division one and the Premier League
four times in the last five seasons and Bolton has done the same
journeys four seasons in a row.
	   Barnsley, relegated from the Premier League after its first ever
season in the top flight, hosts West Bromwich Albion.

Havel's crisis may be over, doctors say

	   PRAGUE, Czech Republic (AP) _ President Vaclav Havel remained on
a respirator Thursday, but doctors said his bout with pneumonia was
taking a positive turn.
	   ``The president had no fever today and his heart's function is
regular,'' said Miroslav Cerbak, the head of Havel's medical team.
	   According to Cerbak, X-rays showed pneumonia receding and
despite the use of a ventilator the president's ability to breathe
independently was improving.
	   ``The new type of antibiotics seems to work,'' said Boris
Stastny, a lung specialist on the team. ``I feel the crisis is
over.''
	   The Czech leader suffered a ruptured colon in April while
vacationing in the Austrian Alps, where he underwent emergency
surgery.
	   On July 26, a combined Austrian-Czech team of doctors in Prague
performed follow-up surgery. Havel developed pneumonia related to
the operation on Monday.
	   Ernst Bodner of the Innsbruck University Clinic declared the
surgery a success Thursday.
	   ``There is no need for me here any more, and I can return home
now,'' said Bodner, who performed both operations.
	   In all of Havel's previous surgeries, breathing problems and
infections often leading to pneumonia hindered the president's
recovery.
	   He has been hospitalized five times since December 1996 when a
third of his lung and a cancerous tumor were removed.
	   On Tuesday, Havel's condition worsened to the point where his
heart rate soared to 200 beats per minute and doctors had to
stabilize his condition with electric shocks.
	   Havel, a former chain smoker and veteran of communist jails, has
suffered from chronic bronchitis for years.

Gov't denies it kept quiet over death of 38 Moroccan immigrants
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MADRID, Spain (AP) _ Spain and Morocco came under fire Thursday
for failing to report an incident in which a boat carrying 39
would-be Moroccan immigrants sank last month, killing all but one
of them.
	   In the first extensive report of the incident, the private
Colpisa news agency said 39 Moroccans had been aboard a boat which
was hit July 6 by a bigger vessel that was supposed to have ferried
them clandestinely from Morocco across the Mediterranean to Spain.
	   Quoting an unidentified official from Morocco's Immigration
Department, the paper said many of the bodies were left to float
about for some 10 days before being picked up.
	   The sinking occurred just off the coast of the Spanish enclave
of Melilla, located on Morocco's northern coast. Colpisa said some
of the bodies were spotted days later by tourists on sailing trips
from the enclave.
	   The agency said Spanish and Moroccan authorities knew about the
sinking but failed to report on it.
	   The human rights group SOS Racism and the opposition Socialist
and United Left parties demanded an explanation from Spain's
Interior Ministry, which is responsible for immigration matters.
	   The ministry denied any wrongdoing.
	   ``There has been no pact of silence with Morocco to keep this
incident quiet,'' said ministry official Jose Ramon Onega. ``We
simply didn't report on it because we are talking about events that
took place in waters outside of Spain's jurisdiction.''
	   Details of the incident came from the lone survivor of the
sinking and four people were being questioned in connection with
the case in Morocco, Colpisa said.
	   Spanish news media said there had been reports of a sinking in
Moroccan waters in July but none involving so many people.
	   Each year, thousands of would-be immigrants pay relatively large
sums to be taken in illegal nighttime trips across the
Mediterranean Sea in the hope of finding a better life in Europe.
Many die in the effort.
	   Those caught are normally repatriated while hundreds, possibly
thousands, are believed to make it across unnoticed.
	   Morocco and Spain have agreed in the past on measures to try to
stamp out criminal gangs who run the clandestine ferries.
	   No comment from Moroccan authorities was immediately available.

Diana and the press, adversaries and allies, says Vanity Fair
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ Princess Diana and the press were adversaries and
allies in a long-running association that damaged Diana when she
was weak and desperate, Vanity Fair magazine says in its latest
issue.
	   As the first anniversary of Diana's death approaches, the
article by Sally Bedell Smith details a mutually manipulative
relationship that finished Aug. 31 in a fatal car crash in a Paris
traffic tunnel.
	   ``It is an undisputed fact that the princess connived with the
media and exploited it for her own interests, just as much as we
exploited her for ours,'' Associated Newspapers chairman, the late
Sir David English, is quoted as saying.
	   The press ``consistently took advantage'' of Diana's
preoccupation with her media image and her weaknesses, Smith
writes.
	   ``She made crucial decisions ... when she was feeling desperate
and insecure,'' Smith wrote, for example providing information for
Andrew Morton's 1991 book, ``Diana, Her True Story,'' revealing the
failure of her marriage.
	   ``Diana had shocked the royal family by airing so much dirty
linen; she had alienated the Establishment, whose support she
needed; and in many ways she had trivialized herself'' with the
book, Smith writes.
	   The 1995 BBC TV interview in which she acknowledged an
adulterous relationship and raised doubts about the readiness of
Prince Charles to be king led to her divorce. Diana's close friend
Rosa Moncton has said the princess regretted doing the interview.

Government, SPLA remain at odds over key issues
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By ABEBE ANDUALEM &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   ADDIS ABABA, Ethiopia (AP) _ The Sudanese government and
southern rebels remain at odds over three issues that are key to
reaching a peace accord to end a 15-year civil war, a rebel
spokesman said Thursday.
	   Pa'gan Amum of the Sudan People's Liberation Army said after
four hours of talks, the sides failed to agree on an interim
arrangement for Africa's largest nation before a referendum on
self-determination agreed to in the last round of talks in May.
	   The SPLA favors two confederal states for a two-year interim
period; the government has proposed a federal system for the entire
country.
	   At issue is the SPLA's desire to add two more provinces to the
three that constituted southern Sudan when the country achieved
independence from an Anglo-Egyptian consortium in 1956.
	   The government has rejected the proposal.
	   Amum said the SPLA plan calls for signature of a peace accord,
followed by disengagement of government and rebel forces under
international supervision.
	   Government and SPLA forces would be deployed under their
respective independent commands during the two-year period.
	   Nor has there been any progress on the issue of the separation
of state and religion, Amum said.
	   The south is mainly Christian and animist, the north is Muslim.
	   The SPLA is calling for a secular state; the government says
citizens should have the right to freedom of conscience but
stressed in their working paper that ``the source of legislation
shall include sharia laws, custom and the consensus of the
nation.''
	   The talks, the third in a series held under the auspices of the
regional Inter-Governmental Authority on Development, had been
expected to end Thursday.
	   The 15-year civil war has ravaged Sudan and created a famine
that is claiming hundreds of lives a day.
	   The SPLA has been fighting the Khartoum government since 1983
for greater autonomy.
	   More than 1.5 milion people have died due to the fighting and
resultant famines.

Butcher sets eyes on a maiden test century
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with tea score
 &UR; By IHITHISHAM KAMARDEEN &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   LEEDS, England (AP) _ England opener Mark Butcher over-shadowed
the much vaunted dual between Mike Atherton and South African pace
bowler Allan Donald with a brilliant half century on the first day
of the fifth cricket test at Headingley Thursday.
	   Butcher hammered an unbeaten 93 as England, batting first after
Alec Stewart won the toss, slowly progressed to 147 for three at
tea on a rain interrupted day.
	   After Donald's understudy Makhaya Ntini had claimed the prized
wicket of Atherton, Butcher provided solidity with a well compiled
233-minute innings.
	   South Africa claimed two important wickets in the post lunch
session _ Nasser Hussain and Stewart _ but Butcher remained
focused, scoring majority of runs on the leg-side with his flick
off the hip.
	   The gritty opener is just seven runs short of his maiden test
century _ his previous high score in 13 tests was 87 against
Australia at Lord's in 1997.
	   Despite all his pre-match talk of aggressive, flat-out bowling,
Donald was disappointing in the first two sessions. In his three
spells in two session, he truggled for rhythm that seemed to have
effectively deserted him since Trent Bridge.
	   The Atherton-Donald showdown didn't happen until the seventh
over of the morning and even that was a let down. Donald's first
ball to Atherton was a wide _ it was his 23rd ball and it took 28
minutes for the pair to come head to head.
	   After the summer's most talked-about confrontation at Trent
Bridge, Atherton faced just six of Donald's first 42 balls.
	   As patient as ever, Atherton, struck just two fours in his 16
scored off 50 balls, before he edged Ntini to Jacques Kallis at
second slip.
	   The South African five-pronged seam attack repeatedly fed
Butcher with leg side half volleys and the left hander accepted
with relish, hitting most of his 15 boundaries on the legside.
	   Hussain struggled for 69 minutes for his nine runs and 44
minutes into the afternoon session he gloved a catch to 'keeper
Mark Boucher off Shaun Pollock, who had beaten the bat without much
luck.
	   Stewart hammered three boundaries in a Ntini over for his 15
runs, but played a rash shot against Donald. Kallis, again at
second slip, held onto a sharp catch.
	   South Africa could have added another wicket but Gehardus
Liebenberg, standing in the gully, spilt an easy catch offered by
Mark Ramprakash off Ntini.

Judge's report blames right-wing state government for Hindu-Muslim
</HEADLINE>
riots &QL; 
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES throughout with details of the report, police on
standby. No pick up &QL; 
 &UR; By RAMOLA TALWAR &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   BOMBAY, India (AP) _ The Hindu nationalist state government on
Thursday rejected a judge's report blaming ruling party leaders for
the 1992-93 Hindu-Muslim riots that killed nearly 800 people in
India's largest city.
	   ``The report is anti-Hindu, pro-Muslim and we do not accept
it,'' said Manohar Joshi, top elected official of western
Maharashtra state, while presenting the judge's findings before the
state legislature.
	   ``It's a biased report...It is prejudiced,'' Joshi said.
	   Joshi's Shiv Sena Party shares power in Maharashtra state with
the right-wing Bharatiya Janata Party. Both are staunch Hindu
nationalists.
	   Judge B.N. Srikrishna blamed Shiv Sena chief Bal Thackeray for
the attacks on the Muslims. He also said that feuding Congress
Party leaders and police failed to stop the killings. The Congress
Party was the governing party in 1992 and Shiv Sena the main
opposition.
	   Judge Srikrishna said there were attacks on the Muslims and
their property in January 1993, followed by the stabbing of Hindus
by professional Muslim criminals with the intention of whipping up
communal anger.
	   There was no doubt that the Shiv Sena took the lead in
organizing attacks on the Muslims, the judge said. ``Shiv Sena
leader Bal Thackeray, who like a veteran general, commanded his
loyal Shiv Sainiks (party supporters) to retaliate by organized
attacks against the Muslims,'' the report said.
	   Srikrishna said the violence triggered by the Shiv Sena was
hijacked by local criminals.
	   Joshi presented the report to the state legislature six months
after the judge had completed his investigation into the riots. The
violence was sparked by the demolition of a historic mosque in the
northern town of Ayodhya by Hindu fundamentalists in 1992. A total
of 2,000 people were killed nationwide, nearly one-third of them in
Bombay alone.
	   The judge's inquiry was ordered by the then ruling Congress
government in 1993.
	   Srikrishna said police were ``cynical and indifferent'' to
appeals from the Muslims for help which resulted in constables
allowing looting and arson to go unchecked.
	   ``The (police) attitude was that one Muslim killed, was one
Muslim less,'' Srikrishna said in his report.
	   Police have charged a Muslim underworld don and his gang with
setting off 13 bombs in Bombay in March 1993 to avenge the attack
on the mosque.
	   The judge didn't name any Muslim organization, but said a number
of individual Muslims and Muslim criminal elements appear to have
indulged in violence.
	   The judge also blamed the media for publishing exaggerated
accounts of the killings which further aroused passions.
	   Joshi's rejection of the report angered opposition lawmakers who
walked out of the state legislature.
	   Thousands of policemen were on alert in violence-prone areas of
the city to prevent trouble. Advertisements have been issued by
Muslim and Hindu social groups appealing to people to stay calm.

Spanish police to extradite 'Stockholm syndrome' figure
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   COPENHAGEN, Denmark (AP) _ One of the hostage-takers in the bank
robbery that spawned the term ''Stockholm syndrome'' will be
extradited from Spain, where he was arrested four months ago,
Danish police said Thursday.
	   Daniel Demunyck was arrested in in the Canary Islands in April
at the request of Danish authorities who allege he is involved in
hashish and amphetamine smuggling.
	   Demuncyk, a Belgian, is the former Swedish citizen once named
Clark Olofsson. In 1973, Olfosson and another man held four people
hostage for six days in a Stockholm bank robbery that went awry.
	   The hostages developed close attachments to their captors, a
phenomenon that has come to be known as the ''Stockholm syndrome''
and has been observed in other hostage situations.
	   Danish police inspector Ib Munch said he did not know when
Demuynck would be brought to Denmark,'' ''but we now have
confirmation that he will be extradited.''

 &UR; South Africa truth panel work over, and many now look for white
gestures &QL; 
 &UR; By DANIEL J. WAKIN &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   JOHANNESBURG, South Africa (AP) _ With an end to the public
exploration of apartheid's atrocities, many blacks are sharpening
their focus on the need for gestures of reconciliation by whites.
	   Archbishop Desmond Tutu, the Nobel laureate and anti-apartheid
hero, made the feeling clear in a tough commentary published this
week in South African newspapers.
	   ``My dear white compatriots, it is a wake up call to you,''
wrote Tutu, who heads the Truth and Reconciliation Commission, the
panel tasked with exposing apartheid's evils. It finished hearing
witnesses last week and is preparing a report due in October.
	   ``Do you want us to degenerate into a Bosnia, a Rwanda, a
Northern Ireland? Or don't you want to contribute to reconciliation
by doing something about transformation?'' Tutu wrote.
	   Similar calls have come from President Nelson Mandela, his
presumed successor Deputy President Thabo Mbeki and from Tutu
himself in recent months. But this was one of the most direct
appeals yet.
	   ``Is there no leader of some stature and some integrity in the
white community ... who will say quite simply, `We had a bad policy
that had evil consequences. We are sorry. Please forgive us?' ''
	   The demands are political, financial and individual.
	   Leaders of the dominant African National Congress blame
conservative white parties like the Freedom Front and National
Party for divisive rhetoric -- criticizing the government for
failing to condemn a rash of slayings of white farmers, for
example.
	   ``The whole thing assumes racial connotations,'' said Parks
Mankahlana, spokesman for President Nelson Mandela. ``It is totally
untrue we don't care for white people, or quietly approve of
murders.''
	   Many also fault leaders of the National Party, the architects
and upholders of apartheid, for not being more forthcoming with the
Truth Commission.
	   ``They have lied as a matter of course,'' Tutu wrote.
	   Mankahlana, in a telephone interview Thursday, also called on
white parties and corporations to support the government's efforts
at affirmative action. A sweeping bill to broaden black
representation in the work force is pending in Parliament.
	   ``Reconciliation has to deal with the problem of communities
that are consigned to perpetual poverty simply because of the color
of their skin,'' he said.
	   White businesses have taken some action. The spokesman praised
mining concern Gencor Ltd for setting up rural schools, clinics and
water supply projects.
	   An editorial in the influential weekly Financial Mail last week
called on companies listed on the Johannesburg Stock Exchange to
donate 1 percent of their capital into a new fund to help the poor.
	   Others appeal for gestures on a smaller scale, such as
volunteerism by individual whites.
	   But resistance is strong.
	   Raphael Wolf, a local ANC leader in a suburb of Cape Town, wrote
in the city's Argus newspaper that many whites fear being seen as
submissive, or a reversal of the old order, or a loss of privilege.
	   Feeding black anger is the slow pace of change. Poverty is
widespread. Black unemployment is 30 to 40 percent, compared to 2
to 3 percent for whites.
	   On their side is one of the world's great conciliators, Mandela,
who was imprisoned for 27 years by the white regime and as
president held off from radical change to avoid alienating whites.
	   He took tea with the wives of apartheid's former presidents and
took the field after South Africa's 1995 World Cup victory in
rugby, a symbol of white oppression to blacks.
	   ``If that is not reconciliation, then what is it?'' Wolf said.

1,000 leva to be exchanged for one new lev in mid-1999
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   SOFIA, Bulgaria (AP) _ Bulgaria's government announced Thursday
a currency reform that will exchange 1,000 current leva for one new
lev starting in July 1999.
	   At present, 1,800 leva buy one U.S. dollar, or 1,000 leva
exchange for one German mark.
	   ``This isn't a revaluation, but just a new denomination,''
Georgi Atanasov, chief of the central bank press center, said.
``One new lev will be equal to one German mark,'' the official
announcement said.
	   Prime Minister Ivan Kostov said the currency reform was agreed
with the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank. ``The
denomination symbolizes the sound Bulgarian lev and the strength of
the country's financial system.''
	   ``The exchange is technical and would cause losses to nobody,''
the central bank statement said. ``The lev won't change its
purchasing ability, because prices will be reduced 1,000 times.''
	   ``The denomination aims to simplify payments ... and to make the
use of the Bulgarian lev more convenient,'' it said.
	   The new and the old leva will be in circulation until Dec. 31,
1999, when the old money will be taken out of circulation, the
statement said.

Israeli minister tells Jordan that solution to peace is imminent
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   AMMAN, Jordan (AP) _ A solution to the blockage of the peace
process is imminent, Israel's Internal Security Minister Avigdor
Kahalani said here Thursday.
	   Speaking after three hours of talks with Jordan's Crown Prince
Hassan, Kahalani said they discussed the Israeli-Palestinian peace
talks, which have been deadlocked for months on Israel's refusal to
accept a U.S. plan for an Israeli military withdrawal from the West
Bank.
	   ``I delivered a message to the Crown Prince from the Israeli
Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu confirming that our government is
solving the problem, and very soon,'' Kahalani told reporters.
	   He did not outline the solution or say when it would come.
	   ``I swear to continue the peace process in Israel. This is my
mission,'' Kahalani said, adding that he cares ``about the next
generations in Israel.''
	   Jordanian Foreign Minister Jawad Anani, who attended the
meeting, told reporters that ``Kahalani shares our views that peace
must come soon.''
	   Peace talks between Israel and the Palestinians have failed to
make any progress since March last year when Israel began building
a Jewish settlement in traditionally Arab east Jerusalem. Earlier
this year the United States proposed a plan whose measures included
an Israeli withdrawal from an additional 13.1 percent of the West
Bank.
	   The Palestinians accepted the plan, but the Israelis have not.
	   Kahalani's one-day trip to Jordan followed the visits of four
prominent members of the Israeli opposition.
	   The leader of the Labor Party Ehud Barak, former Prime Minister
and Labor Party leader Shimon Peres and Labor legislator Yossi
Belin visited Jordan last month for talks with King Hussein and
Prince Hassan. The leader of the left-wing Meretz Party, Yossi
Sarid, came to Amman on Monday for talks with the crown prince as
the king is in hospital in the United States.
	   Jordan has strongly criticized the Netanyahu administration for
its stance on the peace process. Amman is eager for a settlement to
ease opposition among its people to the 1994 Israeli-Jordanian
peace treaty.

Iraq steps up pressure on U.N. weapons inspectors

<TEXT>
	   BAGHDAD, Iraq (AP) _ Making good on its threat to limit arms
inspections, Iraq Thursday banned surprise checks by the U.N.
nuclear agency and told weapons inspectors they can only monitor
sites already checked.
	   The moves follow President Saddam Hussein's decision Wednesday
to freeze cooperation with U.N. weapons inspectors and the
International Atomic Energy Agency. The development threatens to
renew a dispute that nearly started a war six months ago with the
United States and Britain.
	   An IAEA spokesman said the organization has been told it can no
longer carry out surprise inspections of Iraq's nearly defunct
nuclear program.
	   ``We have been told by the government of Iraq that our
activities will be limited to certain declared sites. This is not
acceptable and we are contacting the president of the Security
Council,'' the spokesman, David Kyd, said in Vienna, Austria.
	   In another defiant step, Iraqi escorts refused to accompany a
team of weapons experts from the United Nations Special Commission,
forcing them to abandon their planned searches Thursday, a
government official told The Associated Press.
	   The weapons teams cannot work without escorts under a United
Nations agreements with Iraq.
	   The UNSCOM team was not allowed to conduct ``discussions with
Iraqi authorities on arms or visits to sites or searches for past
weapons,'' the official said, on condition of anonymity.
	   The Iraqi News Agency denied any team was blocked from working,
but did not mention if escorts were refused to the inspectors. U.N.
officials refused to comment on whether any inspectors were kept
from doing their jobs.
	   The reaction to Saddam's latest move has been muted compared to
threats of military action by the United States and Britain during
a previous crisis over arms inspections last winter.
	   ``We believe this move by Iraq is counterproductive, it will
backfire,'' P.J. Crowley, a spokesman for the National Security
Council, said in Washington.
	   Meanwhile, President Bill Clinton's advisers awaited chief U.N.
weapons inspector Richard Butler's briefing to the U.N. Security
Council later Thursday.

	   MILWAUKEE (AP) _ A day-old baby who was born with her heart
outside her body survived a five-hour operation to put the organ in
its rightful place.
	   The procedure Wednesday at Children's Hospital of Wisconsin
moved roughly 95 percent of the heart within the infant's chest
cavity, leaving only a ``little bump'' protruding, said lead
surgeon Dr. Bert Litwin.
	   Litwin was cautiously optimistic about the future of tiny Jazmyn
Hope Stumpf, who was in critical condition Thursday.
	   ``When you are placing the heart into the chest there can be
complications,'' said Litwin, who was aided by three other
surgeons. ``The heart can twist and limit the flow of blood. Most
little hearts cannot tolerate the strain, but this baby's heart
function was good most of the day.''
	   The surgeons had to move organs around in the chest to fit the
heart into the chest cavity, he said.

Irish Olympic champion swimmer banned for four years

<TEXT>
	   LAUSANNE, Switzerland (AP) _ In the latest doping scandal to
rock the sports world, three-time Olympic gold medalist Michelle
Smith was banned from swimming for four years Thursday after being
found guilty of tampering with a urine sample.
	   The international swimming federation (FINA) ruled that Smith
manipulated an out-of-competition drug test by spiking her sample
with a lethal concentration of alcohol.
	   The presence of alcohol, which the doping lab found ``is in no
way compatible with human consumption,'' suggested a possible
attempt to mask the presence of any banned drugs.
	   Although the Irish swimmer escaped the maximum penalty of a life
ban, a four-year suspension would effectively end her career. Smith
is 28 and would miss the 2000 Sydney Olympics and the 2001 world
championships in Fukuoka, Japan.
	   FINA said the ban goes into effect immediately and prohibits
Smith from competing in ``any national or international
competition.''
	   Smith, who has been surrounded by drug allegations since winning
three gold medals at the 1996 Atlanta Olympics, is one of the
highest-profile athletes ever banned for a doping-related offense.
	   Smith is believed to the first world-class athlete ever
suspended for manipulating a urine test, as opposed to testing
positive for a banned substance.
	   The ban came four days after the conclusion of the Tour de
France, which was overshadowed by a series of scandals indicating
widespread use of illegal performance-enhancing drugs by cyclists,
and one week after the doping suspensions of U.S. track and field
stars Dennis Mitchell and Randy Barnes.
	   Smith's lawyer, Peter Lennon, said he would not comment on
FINA's ruling until a news conference in Dublin on Friday. Lennon
previously said he would appeal to a higher authority, such as the
Swiss-based Court of Arbitration for Sport, if the swimmer was
found guilty.
	   In her only public comments on the allegations against her,
Smith read a statement at a news conference in Dublin on April 29.
	   ``I am innocent of these charges,'' she said. ``I am appalled at
the manner in which they have been leaked into the public domain
and I intend fully defending them, if necessary, all to the way to
the International Sports Court in Switzerland.
	   ``I have no intention of taking this lying down and I have no
intention of being bullied by any organization, national or
international.''
	   Smith, who says she has been tested more often than any other
international swimmer, underwent an out-of-competition urine test
in Kilkenny County, Ireland, on Jan. 10.
	   In April, FINA announced that Smith's samples, tested at the
IOC-accredited laboratory in Barcelona, Spain, showed ``unequivocal
signs of adulteration'' and ``physical manipulation.''
	   Under FINA rules, tampering with a urine sample is considered as
serious as taking steroids.
	   FINA said Thursday that its investigation found that the urine
was ``manipulated by the swimmer'' but ``the way of manipulation is
uncertain.''
	   FINA has never explained how alcohol could have found its way
into the sample, which the lab said had a ``very strong whiskey
odour.'' Two doping control samplers were present while Smith
provided the sample.
	   FINA said it found that the manipulation was not carried out in
the laboratory, during the transport or by the collectors of the
sample.
	   The statement said Smith was banned under two rules _ one
covering a ``a competitor (who) uses or takes advantage of a banned
procedure'' and the other for ``use of substances and methods which
alter the integrity and validity of urine samples used in doping
control.''
	   Smith and her lawyer appeared at a hearing of FINA's Doping
Panel in Lausanne on July 24. FINA's statement said the swimmer
``stressed the fact that no banned substance has been detected in
her urine'' and she stated that ``from her side there was no
physical manipulation of the sample.''
	   Smith has persistently denied taking performance-enhancing
drugs. Her coach and husband is former Dutch discus thrower Erik de
Bruin, who served a four-year ban in track and field after testing
positive for high levels of testosterone.
	   Smith won gold medals in Atlanta in the 400 freestyle, 200
individual medley and 400 individual medley. She also won a bronze
medal in the 200 butterfly.
	   In her last major competition, Smith won two gold medals (400
individual medley and 200 freestyle) at the 1997 European
Championships in Seville, Spain.
	   Smith missed this year's world championships in Perth,
Australia, citing injuries.

Etna volcano returns to life after two-week break

<TEXT>
	   CATANIA, Sicily (AP) _ After two weeks of calm, Mount Etna
returned to life Thursday for a few hours, sending up fountains of
lava from the volcano's mouth.
	   The explosive activity, accompanied by seismic tremors, lasted
just under five hours before tapering off, the Italian news agency
ANSA reported from this eastern Sicilian city in the shadow of the
volcano.
	   On July 23, smoke and ash from Etna forced the closure for
several hours of Catania's airport.
	   Experts have said that the volcano, which has been rumbling and
sending up lava and smoke off and on for months, might erupt _
although there is no telling when.

	   YEREVAN, Armenia (AP) _ Armenia's prosecutor general was shot to
death in his office Thursday, apparently by a fellow prosecutor who
then committed suicide, a top law enforcement official said.
	   Genrikh Khachatrian was slain late Thursday afternoon, shortly
after leaving a government meeting in the capital and promising to
return a short time later.
	   A high-ranking Interior Ministry official, speaking on condition
of anonymity, said Khachatrian was believed to have been killed by
another prosecutor, Aram Karapetian, who then committed suicide in
the same office.
	   Karapetian was said to have been a friend of Khachatrian until a
recent falling-out.
	   Khachatrian, 59, had been prosecutor general for a little more
than a year. He previously was a member of Armenia's Constitutional
Court.
	   President Robert Kocharian addressed the nation on television
Thursday night, expressing shock over the killing and praising
Khachatrian for his ``active struggle to establish law in the
country.''
	   He said the case was under investigation.

Archaeologists find new link between Tintagel and King Arthur
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By MARA BELLABY &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ A stone bearing a sixth-century inscription
similar to the name Arthur has been unearthed at Tintagel Castle,
the mythical birthplace of the legendary king of the Round Table,
English Heritage said Thursday.
	   The discovery _ called ``a find of a lifetime'' _ may forge
another link between Arthur and Tintagel, site of a ruined castle
which sits high on the north Cornwall coast, connected to the
mainland by only a slippery, narrow bridge.
	   The slate, measuring 35 centimeters (14 inches) by 20
centimeters (8 inches) and bearing the Latin inscription
``ARTOGNOV,'' was found July 4 as archeologists revisited
excavations from the 1930s, said Kevin Brady of the University of
Glasgow, which carried out the dig for English Heritage.
	   The find will be known as ``Arthur's stone.'' And while there is
no evidence linking it directly with the romantic hero, it does
prove the name Arthur existed around the time King Arthur is
rumored to have lived, said Geoffrey Wainwright, English Heritage's
chief archaeologist.
	   The excavation also shows that after the Romans left England in
410 A.D., some sort of headquarters _ if not royal, at least
belonging to an official high in status _ existed at Tintagel and
that the people there continued to maintain contact with the Roman
Empire, Brady said.
	   ``There is no doubt it was a place of great importance,'' he
said.
	   While archeologists hope the stone will fill some of the many
gaps still existing in Tintagel's history, devotees of the
Arthurian legend hope it will lead to proof of the mythical hero's
existence.
	   Today, the Tintagel area depends greatly on the legendary
connection with King Arthur. As a guidebook says of Tintagel and
King Arthur: ``Fact hereabouts is tremendously hard to separate
from fiction.''
	   If Arthur existed, he lived in the sixth century, said the
English Heritage. But it was a 12th-century Welsh author who first
connected the romantic hero with Tintagel Castle.
	   Geoffrey of Monmouth, in his ``History of the Kings of
Britain,'' tells the story of Arthur's conception after the
high-king of Britain fell in love with a duke's young wife. The
king persuaded the magician Merlin to disguise him as the young
woman's husband, so he could enter Tintagel Castle and seduce her.
That night, the story goes, the future King Arthur was conceived.
	   Yet another version of the legend holds that Arthur was found
washed ashore by Merlin in a cave _ now named after the wizard _
below the castle.
	   ``It is certainly exciting that the name on the stone
corresponds to the legend,'' Brady said. ``But it is just not
possible to link the two from this evidence.''

	   LISBON, Portugal (AP) _ As Lisbon prepared to host a U.N.
conference on youth policy this weekend, thousands of young people
converged on the nearby town of Caparica to discuss the world's
problems in a less formal setting.
	   The fields of brightly-colored tents housing some 7,000 young
people at the sunny town of Caparica about 30 kilometers (20 miles)
south of Lisbon could have been mistaken for a holiday camp.
	   But happy campers don't usually spend their time discussing
human rights, democracy, globalization, health and the environment
_ topics on the agenda at the nine-day World Youth Festival.
	   It was timed to immediately precede a five-day ministerial
conference called to evaluate the U.N. World Program of Action for
Youth. This latter meeting is due to be inaugurated Saturday by
Secretary-General Kofi Annan.
	   More than 100 senior officials expected at the conference were
to discuss how successful the program _ adopted by the U.N. General
Assembly in 1995 _ has been at encouraging governments to take
young people into account in legislation.
	   According to the U.N., the world's 1.3 billion officially
``young'' people _ aged 15 to 24 and making up about one-fifth the
global population _ have particular difficulties dealing with
problems such as drug abuse, poverty, health and development.
	   And according to the Portuguese Youth Institute, the organizers
of the Youth Festival, the young are uniquely placed to discuss
delicate issues in a non-partisan environment.
	   Among the guest speakers due at the festival are Bishop Carlos
Belo of East Timor, co-winner of the 1996 Nobel Peace Prize, and
former Portuguese President Mario Soares.
	   In addition to the Caparica festival and the Lisbon conference,
Portugal was also playing host this week to a World Youth Forum in
the city of Braga, about 350 kilometers (220 miles) north of
Lisbon.
	   Unlike the festival, which has no formal link to the
governmental discussions, the Braga forum was organized by the U.N.
for young people's associations to formulate recommendations for
the ministerial conference.
	   Some 350 delegates at the forum were to recommend to the
ministers that young people be given a greater voice in political
decision-making, particularly on such topics as sustainable
development, racism and sexism, the daily Diario de Noticias
reported Thursday.
	   At the festival in Caparica, participants defined both youth and
the globe's problems more vaguely.
	   The 48-year-old head of the Syrian delegation, Shaker Sai'id,
said he had come to Portugal simply to ``work for a better
future''.

 &UR; By The Associated Press &QC;

	   --------
	   MONROVIA, Liberia (AP) _ President Charles Taylor's Liberian
government has accused its neighbors, Republic of Guinea and Sierra
Leone, of hatching a plot with China to oust Taylor's
administration from power.
	   Speaking to reporters late Tuesday, Liberian defense minister
spokesman Philibert Brown accused China of financing an operation
to overthrow the government.
	   Liberia broke diplomatic links with China last year and
re-established official ties with Taiwan, which China regards as a
renegade province.
	   Leaders of several former armed factions in Liberia, including
former warlord Roosevelt Johnson, have been holding meetings with
Sierra Leonean officials in Sierra Leone's capital of Freetown to
plan the takeover, Brown alleged.
	   Brown said he had documents to prove that dissidents had been
posted in Liberia's capital of Monrovia and were awaiting arms
shipments.
	   Taylor, a former warlord turned politician who emerged the
winner in Liberia's presidential elections last year after seven
years of civil war, has frequently accused Sierra Leone's
government and Nigerian-led West African peacekeepers based in
Liberia and Sierra Leone of siding with Taylor's former foes.
	   -------
	   COTONOU, Benin (AP) _ Benin's used car import trade has
multiplied nearly 50-fold over the last 10 years, according to a
government report.
	   The country imported 145,000 used cars in 1997, according to the
government report issued on Wednesday.
	   Revenue from the used-car business accounts for 5 percent of
Cotonou's port trade and is an increasing source of revenue for
Lebanese and local dealers who dominate the trade, the report said.
	   After the 1994 devaluation of a French-backed currency used
widely in French-speaking Africa, the cost of new cars became
prohibitive, contributing to the popularity of second hand models.
	   Buyers travel from as far as Niger, Mali, Burkina Faso and Ivory
Coast, the report said.
	   ------
	   LAGOS, Nigeria (AP) _ Nigeria signed a dlrs 400 million
agreement to supply petroleum by-products to three neighboring West
African countries.
	   The deal signed on Wednesday paved the way for Nigerian gas
by-products to be piped to Ghana, Togo and Benin, where it will be
used for heating and cooking.
	   American and Dutch oil giants Chevron and Shell will handle
collection and supply of the gas products from Nigeria's oil-rich
Delta region to a massive pipeline linking the commercial capital
of Lagos with the three countries.
	   The World Bank-backed project has been under discussion since
1995.
	   Liquefied petroleum gas (LPG), produced from gas formed in wells
during oil production, is normally burned away, with disastrous
effects on the environment.
	   Aside from being an extra source of revenue, the pipeline would
be a lifeline growing energy needs in the region.
	   -----
	   VICTORIA, Seychelles (AP) _ Two Seychellois men are serving
six-month prison sentences after being convicted of stealing rare
coconuts that resemble female buttocks.
	   The coco de mer _ or sea coconuts _ from Valle de Mai National
Park on Praslin Island, a UNESCO-designated world heritage site,
are poached for illegal sale as souvenirs on this Indian Ocean
archipelago.
	   They are protected by law and are sold only at authorized shops
for about dlrs 220 each.
	   The government is concerned that poaching will deprive future
growth of the palm forest that 19th century British Gen. Charles
Gordon thought was the Garden of Eden.
	   The trees normally first start bearing up to 10 kilogram (22
pound) fruit after 25 years.
	   Some of the palm trees in Valle de Mai are 45 meters (135 feet)
high and 800 years old.
	   -----
	   NAIROBI, Kenya (AP) _ Corruption in Kenya has become a form of
``cannibalism,'' a Kenyan economist said Thursday at the launch of
a study on how to deal with the country's pressing economic and
social problems.
	   ``It is cannibalism, in the sense that (corruption) is now
eating the same structures which used to facilitate it,'' said John
Githongo.
	   Githongo called for self-discipline by Kenyans to end greed.
	   The 444-page study entitled ``Our Problems, Our Solutions'' also
covers education, gender, land tenure, agriculture and
infrastructure.
	   Co-editor Wamuyu Gatheru said the study aims to present issues
in a form that most Kenyans can understand in the hope that it will
spur them to be part of the solution to Kenya's problems.
	   The study was prepared under the auspices of the independent
Institute of Economic Affairs and was funded by Danish, Finnish and
Dutch government aid agencies, the German Friedrich Naumann
Foundation and the U.S. Rockefeller Foundation.
	   -----
	   HARARE, Zimbabwe (AP) _ A brushfire in the Tengwe area near the
northern Zimbabwean town of Karoi caused a countrywide blackout on
Wednesday, an electric company official said.
	   Computers and telephone switchboards crashed, bringing banking
to a standstill for the second successive day after it was halted
by a currency crash on Tuesday.
	   Dozens of people were stuck in elevators and downtown gridlock
ensued when traffic lights failed.
	   A spokesman for the Zimbabwe Electricity Supply Authority said
Thursday that the brush fire tripped power lines in the north from
Kariba to Harare.
	   In a chain-like reaction, the shutdown also caused switches to
automatically close the link to Mozambique's giant Cabora Bassa
hydroelectric dam.

Kucera, Fromberg advance to semifinals
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   AMSTERDAM, Netherlands (AP) _ Top-seeded Slovakian Karol Kucera
dropped just three games Thursday in demolishing compatriot Dominik
Hrbaty 6-2, 6-1 in their Grolsch Open quarterfinal.
	   Kucera faces a Saturday semifinal against the No.6 seed,
Australian Richard Fromberg, who downed unseeded Romanian Adrian
Voinea in straight sets earlier in the afternoon, 6-3, 6-4.
	   A chaotic second set saw Fromberg drop his own serve twice but
break Voinea's three times.
	   Kucera and Hrbaty are friends and doubles partners but Kucera
gave no quarter, sending Hrbaty scurrying into the corners of the
court chasing angled drives.
	   As longer rallies developed it was the seventh-seeded Hrbaty who
tried to hit the ball harder and made the greater number of
unforced errors.
	   Kucera clinced the match after an almost flawless performance
from the baseline in just an hour and seven minutes.
	   Friday's third quarterfinal of this dlrs 500,000 ATP clay court
tourney pits defending champion Slava Dosedel of the Czech
Republic, seeded eight this year, against Argentinian Mariano
Zabaleta.
	   Swede Magnus Norman contests the fourth semifinal place with
Spaniard Galo Blanco.

Flying Finn, within reach of title
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By NESHA STARCEVIC &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   HOCKENHEIM, Germany (AP) _ Like many racers, Mika Hakkinen
developed a taste for speed as a kid behind the wheel of a go-kart.
	   But not many drivers proceed by way of a circus school. Ever
since, his career has been a balancing act between lows and highs.
	   Right now, the Flying Finn is at the top, speeding toward his
first Formula One championship.
	   It took Hakkinen a long time to become a top Formula One driver,
and the reticent Finn is understandably cautious.
	   ``There are still plenty of races left, and anything can
happen,'' Hakkinen said after winning Sunday in the German Grand
Prix. ``You have to keep pushing and go flat out, and that's what I
intend to do.''
	   With five races left in the Formula One season, Hakkinen is not
secure yet despite a 16-point lead over two-time champion Michael
Schumacher.
	   But the Finn has performed well under pressure this season, and
the McLaren-Mercedes cars have been the quickest, and as important,
the most reliable.
	   When Schumacher broke McLaren's early dominance and put together
three straight victories to come within two points of Hakkinen, the
Finn had a reply: He won the next two races and padded his lead.
	   By winning in Austria and Germany, Hakkinen has shifted the
pressure to Schumacher, who will have to win in Hungary on Aug. 16
to retain any realistic chance of becoming the first Ferrari driver
to take the title since Jody Scheckter of South Africa in 1979.
	   Although cautious, Hakkinen is confident.
	   ``We have a very good car, a great package and very good
tires,'' he said.
	   Success was slow in coming for the 29-year-old Finn.
	   He joined the Formula One circuit in 1991 with the Lotus team.
In 1993, however, he was relegated to testing for McLaren _ not
altogether surprising considering its drivers were Ayrton Senna and
Michael Andretti. Hakkinen nearly quit.
	   ``I had to be patient in waiting for success,'' Hakkinen said.
``I always kept hoping, although it's a good thing that no one told
me it would take so long.''
	   His climb began in 1994, when Senna moved to Williams. Hakkinen
finished fourth in the standings.
	   But the next setback came in 1995, when Hakkinen was involved in
a horrific crash during practice for the Australian Grand Prix. He
had severe head injuries, and spent several days in a coma.
	   A punctured tire sent his car into a protective barrier, and it
became airborne. Hakkinen admits it was difficult for him to resume
his racing career.
	   But he did _ within five months of the crash _ and finished
fifth in an astonishing return at the 1996 Australian Grand Prix.
	   ``I will carry it with me for the rest of my life,'' he said of
the crash. ``Not that I have nightmares or anything like that, but
it changed me so much for the positive.
	   ``Something like that certainly opens your eyes, and maybe I
don't take so many risks in the car anymore. It's like beginning a
second life.''
	   That second life has been good. Hakkinen's long-awaited first
Formula One victory finally came in October 1997, in Jerez, Spain,
in his 96th race.
	   ``After that, everything became easier,'' he said. ``I knew then
I could really win.''
	   That Hakkinen has done six times in 11 races this year.
	   Newly married to his longtime girlfriend, Erja, Hakkinen has
just extended his contract with McLaren through next season.
	   He learned to drive as a 6-year-old in a go-kart and wanted to
pursue a racing career. But Hakkinen's father was not impressed,
and sent him to a circus school in Helsinki.
	   Although he never became a clown or a tightrope walker, Hakkinen
says it was a good ``school of life.''
	   Then he learned a lot by watching the driving of Senna, Alain
Prost and Nigel Mansell, and picked up tips from Keke Rosberg, the
former Finnish ace who now is his manager.
	   ``I think I have talent,'' Hakkinen said. ``I've worked for
years to improve it and to use it the best I can.
	   ``But there are still things I can improve.''

	   KABUL, Afghanistan (AP) _ Nearly 100 Taliban soldiers have died
in the last 24 hours battling an opposition alliance in northern
Afghanistan, a spokesman for the alliance said Thursday.
	   Taliban spokesman Abdul Hay Muttayn said he could not
immediately confirm the reports which also said the Taliban were
losing ground.
	   Anti-Taliban spokesman Abdullah, who uses only one name, said
his forces recaptured territory from the Taliban near the key
northern city of Mazar-e-Sharif in heavy fighting, repelled a
Taliban attack in the region, and captured the strategic town of
Borka to the south. He did not mention alliance casualties.
	   The capture of Borka, 200 kilometers (120 miles) southeast of
Mazar-e-Sharif, would relieve pressure on anti-Taliban leader Ahmed
Shah Masood's stronghold in the Panjshir Valley just north of the
Afghan capital of Kabul. Abdullah, speaking by telephone from
London, said the attack on Borka was ``very massive.''
	   Abdullah added that top alliance military commanders met for a
strategy session Wednesday in Hayratan, about 60 kilometers (40
miles) east of Mazar-e-Sharif. The sometimes fractious
northern-based alliance is closing ranks to defend Mazar-e-Sharif,
the only city outside Taliban control. The Taliban hold almost all
of Afghanistan, including Kabul.
	   Earlier Thursday, a rocket hit the perimeter of Kabul's airport
after a night of heavy fighting north of the Afghan capital that
injured two civilians. No casualties or damage was reported in the
rocket attack.
	   In a statement Thursday, the Taliban Foreign Ministry pledged to
fight the alliance, rejecting calls for peace.
	   Russia and Uzbekistan on Wednesday urged all sides in the Afghan
conflict to find a peaceful solution. The United Nations' Security
Council also expressed concern Wednesday over the ``dangerous
escalation of the armed conflict'' and called for peace talks in
Afghanistan.
	   The Taliban have imposed a strict version of Islamic law in
areas they control. Most women are barred from work and most girls
from school, music is banned, men are required to wear beards and
public mutilation of thieves is common.
	   Taliban said their advance was not a threat to neighboring
countries. Russia has long been fearful the Taliban's strict brand
of Islam would spread to neighbors like Uzbekistan and other former
central Asian regions of the Soviet Union.
	   Russian troops who patrol Tajikistan's border with Afghanistan
have taken measures to prevent Taliban forces from crossing in case
they overrun northern -based opposition forces, the border guard
chief said.
	   ``Appropriate instructions have already been given to forestall
an advance by Taliban fighters,'' Border Service Chief Nikolai
Bordyuzha said, according to the Interfax news agency. The measures
would also prevent an influx of refugees chased out by the Taliban,
he said.

Confident French are on a roll: how long can it last?

	   PARIS (AP) _ They're selling jetliners, cars and bullet trains
like hotcakes, unemployment is falling, consumer confidence is at
its highest in 11 years. And they just won the World Cup.
	   Less than three years after France searched its soul amid the
worst labor strikes since 1968, the country looks to be on a roll.
	   Whether it lasts beyond the summer euphoria depends heavily on
whether economic and political reforms succeed. But one thing is
clear: a renewed confidence is in the air.
	   ``At last, we've got our morale,'' headlined Thursday's
France-Soir newspaper, with a picture of flag-waving, face-painted
World Cup fans and the latest upbeat consumer figures.
	   Pollster Stephane Rozes says the latest surveys indicate the
French ``want to celebrate. They're tired of being fed up.
	   ``People think it's getting better in France,'' he said in a
telephone interview. ``Their condition may not be better, really,
but there's an improved climate.''
	   Both conservative President Jacques Chirac and Socialist Prime
Minister Lionel Jospin have ratings around 70 percent. State
industries are being sold off and merged, and most of the
government is finally on the Internet after lagging way behind
other countries.
	   After years of recession, the economy is expected to grow by at
least 3 percent this year. But France could also fall victim to its
own recent success: unions are demanding a greater share of the
wealth, and are threatening new labor action.
	   Among the latest economic signs: Renault reported Thursday that
its auto sales had risen 22 percent from last year. The government
said this week that consumer confidence was the highest since 1987,
and unemployment edged down further this month _ from 11.9 to 11.8
percent.
	   In recent weeks, the French-based European consortium Airbus has
reported a string of new jetliner sales as it challenges Boeing's
global lead. France's high-speed TGV train won new contracts in the
United States, Australia and Taiwan.
	   Morale could stay up ``if growth holds up,'' said Henri
Petitgand, a Jospin spokesman. ``After several gray years, they
(the French) have found optimism again.''
	   The drug scandal surrounding the Tour de France cycling race,
which ended Sunday, apparently did little to dampen the overall
mood.
	   Parisians are still jamming the official World Cup gift shop on
the Champs-Elysees. Buying World Cup drinking glasses on Thursday,
19-year-old Carole Heirich was upbeat about the soccer victory, but
not about the economy.
	   ``Unemployment is down, but that's only because there are more
short-term jobs,'' she said.
	   Sandra Guerrero, eating lunch in a cafe, said that whatever the
economic news, she's seen no improvement in her finances.
	   ``We're still heavily taxed, we're still paying high social
charges. Salaries aren't changing. People still beg in the
subway,'' said the 26-year-old advertising agent.
	   That kind of discontent could increase at the so-called
``rentree,'' or ``return'' from the traditional August vacations.
	   Unions are insisting Jospin implement his 35-hour work week law,
aimed at spreading jobs around, but businesses are fighting it.
Labor protests against new privatizations or mergers could
intensify.
	   And if the Asian economic crisis should deepen, or the global
economy suffer a downturn, that ``could again bring a situation of
weak growth,'' said pollster Rozes.
	   ``Jospin would again be confronted by the problems the leaders
of other countries face,'' he said.

Russian government threatens to seize oil company assets
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: INSERTS 1 graf after 5th graf, `The government ...,' to UPDATE

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ The government on Thursday threatened to seize the
assets and possibly reduce export quotas of three large oil
companies that have failed to pay back taxes.
	   Desperate to increase tax revenues, the government has toughened
its stance toward tax-dodging oil companies, which are among the
country's biggest export earners.
	   Russian oil companies Sidanko, Slavneft, Eastern Oil Company and
Onako have not paid taxes incurred between May and July, said
Vladimir Popov, a department head at the Federal Tax Service.
	   Sidanko, Eastern and Onako face the possible seizure of their
assets, Popov said, declining to explain why Slavneft did not.
	   The government has made similar threats against Russia's largest
companies before, but has not acted on them.
	   Officials for two of the companies, Sidanko and Eastern, argued
that the government itself should cover a portion of the tax
arrears. Eastern noted that it is partly owned by the state, giving
the government a portion of the liability. And Sidanko said the
state should offset the company's debt by the amount it owes for
unpaid oil supplies.
	   Sidanko owes the government 738 million rubles (about dlrs 120
million), Slavneft 337 million rubles (dlrs 54 million), Eastern
Oil 219 million rubles (dlrs 35 million) and Onako 214 million
rubles (dlrs 34 million), Popov told a news conference.
	   ``Yesterday we cabled regional tax offices to carry out
necessary measures, including the seizure of assets such as foreign
exchange and ruble accounts, as well as cars and holiday homes, to
force the companies to pay their obligations,'' Popov said. ``This
is something that will really hurt these people.''
	   Popov also said that the Ministry of Fuel and Energy may decide
to reduce Sidanko's and Onako's export quotas.
	   The government can control oil export quotas through the
state-owned pipeline operator Transneft.
	   Russia's tax collection figures have improved recently, but are
still lower than hoped for.
	   Tax receipts for August are expected to total 12.5 billion
rubles (dlrs 2 billion), up marginally from July. But the figure
will still fall short of the target of 14.8 billion rubles (dlrs
2.3 billion), news report said.
	   Meanwhile, tax debts to the federal budget reached 234.2 billion
rubles (dlrs 37 billion) on July 1, rising 37 percent from the end
of last year, Popov said. Total debts, including fines for unpaid
taxes, reached 445.2 billion rubles (dlrs 72 billion), he said.
	   In other economic developments Thursday, the Central Bank's
hard-currency reserves fell by dlrs 800 million in the last week of
July and stood at dlrs 18.4 billion on July 31, the bank announced
Thursday.
	   Also, the World Bank's board of directors in Washington was to
decide Thursday whether to release a dlrs 1.5 billion economic
restructuring loan to Russia, Interfax news agency reported.
	   The Russian stock market closed down 4.1 percent on weak volume.
Traders blamed the decline on concern over Asian stocks after
recent declines in international markets.

Iraq steps up pressure on U.N. weapons inspectors
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: RECASTS and UPDATES throughout with world reax. No pick up &QL; 
 &UR; By LEON BARKHO &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   BAGHDAD, Iraq (AP) _ Making good on its threat to limit arms
inspections, Iraq Thursday banned surprise checks by the U.N.
nuclear agency and told weapons inspectors they can only monitor
sites already checked.
	   The moves follow President Saddam Hussein's decision Wednesday
to freeze cooperation with U.N. weapons inspectors and the
International Atomic Energy Agency. The development threatens to
renew a dispute that nearly started a war six months ago with the
United States and Britain.
	   An IAEA spokesman said the organization has been told it esident of the Security
Council,'' the spokesman, David Kyd, said in Vienna, Austria.
	   In another defiant step, Iraqi escorts refused to accompany a
team of weapons experts from the United Nations Special Commission,
forcing them to abandon their planned searches Thursday, a
government official told The Associated Press.
	   The weapons teams cannot work without escorts under a United
Nations agreements with Iraq.
	   The UNSCOM team was not allowed to conduct ``discussions with
Iraqi authorities on arms or visits to sites or searches for past
weapons,'' the official said, on condition of anonymity.
	   The Iraqi News Agency denied any team was blocked from working,
but did not mention if escorts were refused. U.N. officials refused
to comment on whether any inspectors were kept from doing their
jobs.
	   The reaction to Saddam's latest move has been muted compared to
threats of military action by the United States and Britain during
a previous crisis over arms inspections last winter.
	   ``We believe this move by Iraq is counterproductive, it will
backfire,'' P.J. Crowley, a spokesman for the National Security
Council, said in Washington.
	   Meanwhile, President Bill Clinton's advisers awaited chief U.N.
weapons inspector Richard Butler's briefing to the U.N. Security
Council later Thursday.
	   In London, British Foreign Secretary Robin Cook said Iraq must
fulfill its obligations to the United Nations. ``This latest move
will only delay the moment when the Security Council can consider
the removal of sanctions,'' he said.
	   Britain has been a staunch opponent of relaxing U.N. sanctions
on Iraq. France _ another permanent Security Council member that
has sought to ease the strictures _ said Saddam's declaration of
non-cooperation was ``unacceptable.''
	   ``France asks Iraq not to implement its decision,'' a French
Foreign Ministry statement said.
	   Saddam took the confrontational stand after Butler refused
Monday to provide an immediate certification that Iraq has
destroyed all its weapons of mass destruction _ chemical and
biological arms and long-range missiles.
	   Such a testimonial by UNSCOM is necessary before the Security
Council will lift economic sanctions imposed in 1990 after Iraq's
invasion of Kuwait.
	   Butler has said that he was close to giving a thumbs up on
Iraq's chemical and missile programs but needed more information on
biological weapons.
	   On Thursday, convoys of U.N. vehicles carrying some monitoring
officials left the U.N. headquarters on Baghdad's eastern outskirts
followed by cars with Iraqi officials. No one interfered with their
work.
	   ``Ongoing monitoring continues,'' U.N. spokesman Janet Sullivan
told the AP.
	   About 460 sites in Iraq have been inspected and are under
monitoring. About 100 U.N. experts visit the sites or use
remote-controlled cameras and sensors.
	   Saddam's non-cooperation stand is his most aggressive step since
he made his palaces off-limits to weapons inspectors late last
year. The crisis was resolved in February, averting a possible U.S.
and British military strike.
	   Last month, Saddam demanded that the sanctions be lifted by the
end of this year, the first time he set a deadline.
	   That and the latest developments reflect the growing
frustrations in Iraq with the eight-year-old sanctions, which have
crippled the economy by banning the free sale of oil, the country's
largest revenue earner.

Todor Zhivkov, Bulgaria's former Communist dictator, dies at 86

<TEXT>
	   SOFIA, Bulgaria (AP) _ Long-time dictator Todor Zhivkov, the
last surviving strongman of the Soviet Union's eastern European
empire, has died, officials and his family announced Thursday. He
was 86.
	   Zhivkov, who ruled Bulgaria with an iron fist for 35 years until
being relegated to infamy and then oblivion after his ouster in
1989, died in a hospital Wednesday night after a long illness.
	   He had fallen into a coma after being hospitalized July 8 with a
respiratory infection, hospital officials were quoted by the
official BTA news agency as saying. He also had suffered from
diabetes and other ailments in recent months.
	   Bulgaria's reformist president, Petar Stoyanov, said in a public
statement that Zhivkov oversaw ``one of the darkest periods of
recent Bulgarian history.''
	   ``Eight million Bulgarians lived during that long period with
their work, dreams and illusions, but also in fear and political
repression,'' Stoyanov said. ``With the death of Todor Zhivkov the
era of Bulgarian communism is finally ending.''
	   Zhivkov outlived his former Kremlin bosses and other Balkan
dictators: Yugoslavia's Josip Broz Tito died in 1980, and Albania's
Enver Hoxha in 1985. Romania's Nicolae Ceausescu was executed in
1989.
	   But his dominant presence at home had long faded. Radio and
television reported his death briefly, but public fear and anger
toward the ex-dictator once known as ``Papa Zhivkov'' had turned
largely to apathy, with many younger Bulgarians now unaware of his
impact.
	   Dimitar Georgiev, a 46-year-old technician in Sofia, said he
approved of Bulgaria's rulers having ``let the old man die in
peace.''
	   ``After all,'' he said, ``Zhivkov was part of history, for good
or bad.''
	   Among sparse international reaction to become public, the
Russian Communist Party called his death an irreparable loss
because Zhivkov ``always was a true friend of our country.''
	   ``Nobody will be able to drop Zhivkov's name from the history of
Bulgaria or his contribution to the advancement of the country,''
the party's presidium said, according to Russia's Interfax news
agency.
	   His longevity at Bulgaria's helm was largely based on such
absolute servility to Moscow that Zhivkov once proposed that
Bulgaria should merge with the Soviet Union.
	   Zhivkov dealt mercilessly with dissent, imprisoning thousands of
people in the Lovech and Skravena prison camps in the 1950s and
1960s.
	   ``He served the Soviet Union more ardently than the Soviet
leaders themselves did,'' wrote Georgi Markov, a defector working
for the BBC in London. In 1978, Markov was slain _ most likely by
Bulgarian agents _ with a special umbrella that injected him with a
tiny poison vial.
	   Zhivkov was born into a poor family in Pravets, near Sofia, on
Sept. 7, 1911. Like others who rose to Communist heights after
World War II, Zhivkov came from a rural background.
	   He was part of a generation that got its first education after
World War I dissolved the Ottoman and Habsburg empires that had
ruled the Balkans for centuries. His learning led him to embrace
revolution, and Zhivkov joined Bulgaria's illegal Communist party
in 1932.
	   His meteoric rise through the party ranks started in 1944, when
the Bulgarian Communists seized power with the backing of the Red
Army. In 1954, he became first secretary of Bulgaria's staunchly
Stalinist Communist Party.
	   Bulgaria's course meshed tightly with Moscow's until the late
1980s, when Soviet dogmatism eased under Mikhail Gorbachev _ a man
Zhivkov despised until his death.
	   In 1956, Zhivkov demonstrated his loyalty to Nikita Khrushchev
by siding with him in his condemnation of Josef Stalin. With the
same ease, he allied with Leonid Brezhnev and other Moscow
hard-liners when they ousted Khrushchev in 1964.
	   In 1965, Zhivkov crushed an attempt by some Bulgarian Communists
to yank the country from its increasingly tight Soviet orbit,
declaring afterward that he was ``with the Soviet Union for life or
death!''
	   An attempt to groom his daughter Ludmila as heir ended with her
death under unclear circumstances in 1981.
	   With the advent of Gorbachev's reforms, Zhivkov's grip on power
started to slip.
	   Zhivkov was ousted as head of the communist party in 1989 and
replaced as president of Bulgaria.
	   He was arrested the following year on charges of
misappropriating state funds. He was sentenced in 1991 to seven
years in prison, but his failing health meant he never went to
jail. Instead, he spent his final years under house arrest.
	   In 1998, Zhivkov was suddenly reinstated as a member of the
Socialist party, which succeeded the Communists, and found himself
able to alarm rivals and inspire rousing ovations again, although
he maintained authorities bugged his conversations until the end.
	   ``They are afraid of the people,'' he said in an interview with
The Associated Press in March at his mountain villa overlooking the
Bulgarian capital. ``The people remember what I did for them.''
	   Zhivkov is survived by his son, Vladimir, who lives in Sofia.
State radio said the funeral would be held Sunday in the Bulgarian
capital.

Health groups warn Russia is incubating drug-resistant TB
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Three international health organizations appealed
to President Boris Yeltsin on Thursday to do more to combat the
spread of drug-resistant tuberculosis, warning that Russia has
become ``the world's incubator of the deadly disease.''
	   The letter sent to the Kremlin pointed in particular to the
situation in Russia's prisons, where tuberculosis is widespread and
as many as 40 percent of cases involve drug-resistant TB strains.
	   ``Unless urgent measures are taken, multi-drug resistant TB will
spread beyond the confines of the Russian penal system and will
cause countless loss of life and enormous economic damage in
Russian society and the world at large,'' the letter warned.
	   The letter was signed by Belgium-based Medicins San Frontieres
(Doctors Without Borders), Britain-based Medical Emergency Relief
International, and New York-based Public Health Research Institute.
	   The groups estimated that between 15,000 and 20,000 Russians are
infected with drug-resistant tuberculosis, two-thirds of whom are
inmates.
	   TB has re-emerged as a significant health problem around the
world. While Russia's infection rate is below that of many other
countries, health workers say the prevalence of drug-resistant
strains, especially in the prison system, is especially worrisome.
	   The tuberculosis bacteria is airborne and must be treated by
antibiotics for as long as six months. If a patient fails to
complete the treatment course, the bacteria can develop resistance
to the drug and people infected later will have a harder time
getting rid of it.
	   The letter warned that the special drugs needed to treat the
resistant strains are too expensive for public health care systems
even in wealthy countries.
	   ``In practical terms, multi-drug resistant TB is incurable,''
the letter said.

Dense smoke from fires causes accidents on Italian roads
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   SALERNO, Italy (AP) _ Smoke blowing across autostrada and local
roads from brush fires in Italy Thursday was blamed for several
injury-causing accidents.
	   At least 11 people, including a child who was taken to a
hospital in a coma, were injured in the rash of accidents in
southern Italy near major roads licked by fire in the Campagna and
Calabria regions, Italian news reports said.
	   In Liguria, Italy's northwestern coastal region, the A12
autostrada was virtually cut in two by the closure of a stretch
when flames came perilously close to the road. At one point,
tollbooth employees fled their work station when flames approached.
	   Tanker planes dropped water on the blaze, but motorists on many
stretches of A12 still open reported smoke was greatly reducing
visibility.
	   Weeks of temperatures in the mid-to-upper 30s (90sF) and scarse
rain have fed fires throughout Italy.

Outcry in Israel over funds withheld from Holocaust survivors
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with comment from fund director, grafs 13-14
 &UR; By JACK KATZENELL &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ The disclosure that elderly, mentally ill
Holocaust survivors were being denied use of reparation money
earmarked for them drew widespread condemnation in Israel on
Thursday.
	   Millions of dollars in reparations paid by Germany are sitting
in the patients' bank accounts, but government trustees have
refused to approve using the money to improve their bleak living
conditions.
	   The controversy came to light when doctors at Abarbanel Hospital
near Tel Aviv said proposals to use the funds for televisions, air
conditioners and holiday parties for the patients had been denied
by government trustees.
	   Avraham Hirschson, head of a parliamentary committee dealing
with reparations to Holocaust survivors, called on parliament to
return from its summer recess and hold emergency debate on the
``the disgraceful exploitation of Holocaust survivors' funds.''
	   Israel's chief rabbi, Meir Lau _ himself a Holocaust survivor _
called the allegations shocking, and said he planned to visit the
patients to try to ease their plight.
	   ``I think the power of every moral society depends on its
approach to the weakest, and our weakest are Holocaust survivors
who are not healthy in mind and spirit,'' he said.
	   Avner Shalev, chairman of Yad Vashem, Israel's Holocaust
memorial and museum, said he was ``simply astounded by the
insensitivity and the malice'' of the officials involved.
	   He proposed transferring control of the funds to a body ``with
the sensitivity needed to work with Holocaust survivors.''
	   About 900 of the 360,000 Holocaust survivors who live in Israel
are believed to be in mental hospitals. Most have been
institutionalized since they came to Israel in the 1940s and 1950s
and were unable to adjust to life in a new Jewish state that wanted
to look to the future rather than remember past sufferings.
	   The survivors, many in their 80s, suffer from illnesses that
include acute depression and schizophrenia, which are attributed to
their experiences in the Nazi death camps.
	   Some have accumulated large sums of money in reparations from
the German government, receiving as much as several hundred dollars
a month for the past four decades. The Maariv newspaper, which
first reported the story, estimated that altogether the patients
have several million dollars.
	   Due to their mental illnesses, these survivors were made wards
of the state. Their bank accounts are administered by the
court-appointed Fund for the Care of Dependents, which is
supervised by the government's General Custodian for Wards,
attorney Shmuel Tsur.
	   In an interview with Israel Television Thursday, Tsur said he
would personally deal with any complaints regarding the fund. He
insisted that the fund works to improve a patient's situation as
much as possible.
	   ``The policy is to give, not to save,'' Tsur said.
	   Jonathan Lemberger, head of a support organization for Holocaust
survivors, said the situation was symptomatic of a wider problem.
He also said the state was withholding other Holocaust reparation
money, including the legacies of survivors who died without heirs.
	   ``The mental patients' accounts are only the tip of the
iceberg,'' he said.

Portugal hosts three international youth events

<TEXT>
	   LISBON, Portugal (AP) _ As Lisbon prepared to host a U.N.
conference on youth policy this weekend, thousands of young people
converged on the nearby town of Caparica to discuss the world's
problems in a less formal setting.
	   The fields of brightly-colored tents housing some 7,000 young
people at the sunny town of Caparica about 30 kilometers (20 miles)
south of Lisbon could have been mistaken for a holiday camp.
	   But happy campers don't usually spend their time discussing
human rights, democracy, globalization, health and the environment
_ topics on the agenda at the nine-day World Youth Festival.
	   It was timed to immediately precede a five-day ministerial
conference called to evaluate the U.N. World Program of Action for
Youth. This latter meeting is due to be inaugurated Saturday by
Secretary-General Kofi Annan.
	   More than 100 senior officials expected at the conference were
to discuss how successful the program _ adopted by the U.N. General
Assembly in 1995 _ has been at encouraging governments to take
young people into account in legislation.
	   According to the U.N., the world's 1.3 billion officially
``young'' people _ aged 15 to 24 and making up about one-fifth the
global population _ have particular difficulties dealing with
problems such as drug abuse, poverty, health and development.
	   And according to the Portuguese Youth Institute, the organizers
of the Youth Festival, the young are uniquely placed to discuss
delicate issues in a non-partisan environment.
	   Among the guest speakers due at the festival are Bishop Carlos
Belo of East Timor, co-winner of the 1996 Nobel Peace Prize, and
former Portuguese President Mario Soares.
	   In addition to the Caparica festival and the Lisbon conference,
Portugal was also playing host this week to a World Youth Forum in
the city of Braga, about 350 kilometers (220 miles) north of
Lisbon.
	   Unlike the festival, which has no formal link to the
governmental discussions, the Braga forum was organized by the
United Nations for young people's associations to formulate
recommendations for the ministerial conference.
	   Some 350 delegates at the forum were to recommend to the
ministers that young people be given a greater voice in political
decision-making, particularly on such topics as sustainable
development, racism and sexism, the daily Diario de Noticias
reported Thursday.
	   At the festival in Caparica, participants defined both youth and
the globe's problems more vaguely.
	   The 48-year-old head of the Syrian delegation, Shaker Sai'id,
said he had come to Portugal simply to ``work for a better
future''.

	   BEIRUT, Lebanon (AP) _ American jazz singer Nina Simone blamed
racism in the United States Thursday for her decision to live
abroad for the past 25 years.
	   Speaking to reporters here a day after arriving in Lebanon to
sing at an annual festival, Simone said that as a black person, ``I
have paid a heavy price fighting the establishment.''
	   She did not elaborate, but said that racial inequality in the
United States was now ``worse than ever.''
	   ``I have not lived in America for 25 years ... because of the
racism.''
	   Simone, 65, began her career in the early fifties. She took part
in the civil rights' movement of the sixties and dedicated several
songs to the cause of racial equality.
	   She left the United States in 1973 and lived in the Caribbean
and Africa until settling in Europe.
	   Simone will perform this weekend at the Baalbek International
Festival in eastern Lebanon.

Smith supporters saddened by FINA ban
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   DUBLIN, Ireland (AP) _ Ireland's sports minister described as a
``tragedy'' the four-year ban imposed Thursday on triple Olympic
gold medalist Michelle Smith by swimming's world governing body.
	   But one of Smith's former rival said FINA should be applauded
for taking a stand.
	   Smith, the first Irish swimmer to win an Olympic gold medal, was
found guilty by a FINA doping panel of tampering with a urine
sample provided during an out-of-competition test at her home in
Ireland in January.
	   Irish Sports Minister Jim McDaid said the ban was ``a personal
tragedy for the swimmer and her family.''
	   McDaid, speaking from Iceland where he is on government
business, said he, like the rest of the Irish people, was
``saddened and disappointed'' at the panel's decision and hoped
Smith could prove her innocence.
	   The Irish Amateur Swimming Association released a statement
saying it accepted the FINA ruling but was awaiting further
developments on an appeal.
	   ``As this is the first case of a drug-related penalty in the
104-year history of the Irish swimming, it is the source of major
concern to everyone in the Irish swimming community,'' the
statement said.
	   British Olympic swimmer Karen Pickering _ who competed against
Smith as recently as the European Championships last year _
commended FINA's tough stance.
	   ``It does give us faith in the testing system,'' Pickering said.
``If there is one positive aspect to come out of the whole affair,
it is that it might put other people off doing the same thing.
	   ``FINA are to be applauded for taking a stand. They are not
going to act lightly against people who test positive or tamper
with their tests.''
	   Smith has been under suspicion ever since her success at the
1996 Atlanta Olympics, where she won gold in the 400-meter
freestyle, 400 individual medley and the 200 individual medley and
bronze in the 200 butterfly

Georgia, Abkhazia form joint task force on terrorism
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   TBILISI, Georgia (AP) _ Georgia and its breakaway province of
Abkhazia established a joint task force Thursday to investigate
terrorism in the troubled region.
	   The group was established at a weekly meeting of Georgian and
Abkhazian representatives with Russian peacekeeping forces in the
village of Chuburkhindzhi in the Ghali region.
	   ``We've been trying to form such a group for a long time, but in
vain,'' the commander of Russian peacekeeping forces, Gen. Maj.
Sergei Korobko, told Georgian television. ``If something happens,
this group will work and will find out who did it and will name
those who are to be blamed.''
	   The Russian peacekeepers were sent to stabilize the Black Sea
province of Abkhazia in 1994 following a war in which Abkhazian
separatists drove out Georgian government troops.
	   Large-scale fighting has ended, but sporadic clashes and acts of
terrorism continue, despite the peacekeepers' presence. Georgia has
repeatedly expressed dissatisfaction with the job the Russians are
doing.

Outcry in Israel over funds withheld from Holocaust survivors
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: RECASTS and UPDATES throughout with comment from fund director
and others, No pick up &QL; 
 &UR; By JACK KATZENELL &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ The disclosure that elderly, mentally ill
Holocaust survivors were being denied use of reparation money
earmarked for them drew widespread condemnation in Israel on
Thursday.
	   Millions of dollars in reparations paid by Germany are sitting
in the patients' bank accounts, but government trustees have
refused to approve using the money to improve their bleak living
conditions.
	   The controversy came to light when doctors at Abarbanel Hospital
near Tel Aviv said proposals to use the funds for televisions, air
conditioners and holiday parties for the patients had been denied
by government trustees.
	   Avraham Hirschson, head of a parliamentary committee dealing
with reparations to Holocaust survivors, called on parliament to
return from its summer recess and hold emergency debate on the
``the disgraceful exploitation of Holocaust survivors' funds.''
	   Israel's chief rabbi, Meir Lau _ himself a Holocaust survivor _
called the allegations shocking, and said he planned to visit the
patients to try to ease their plight.
	   ``I think the power of every moral society depends on its
approach to the weakest, and our weakest are Holocaust survivors
who are not healthy in mind and spirit,'' he said.
	   Avner Shalev, chairman of Yad Vashem, Israel's Holocaust
memorial and museum, said he was ``simply astounded by the
insensitivity and the malice'' of the officials involved.
	   He proposed transferring control of the funds to a body ``with
the sensitivity needed to work with Holocaust survivors.''
	   About 900 of the 360,000 Holocaust survivors who live in Israel
are believed to be in mental hospitals. Most have been
institutionalized since they came to Israel in the 1940s and 1950s
and were unable to adjust to life in a new Jewish state that wanted
to look to the future rather than remember past sufferings.
	   The survivors, many in their 80s, suffer from illnesses that
include acute depression and schizophrenia, which are attributed to
their experiences in the Nazi death camps.
	   Some have accumulated large sums of money in reparations from
the German government, receiving as much as several hundred dollars
a month for the past four decades. The Maariv newspaper, which
first reported the story, estimated that altogether the patients
have several million dollars.
	   Due to their mental illnesses, these survivors were made wards
of the state. Their bank accounts are administered by the
court-appointed Fund for the Care of Dependents, which is
supervised by the government's General Custodian for Wards,
attorney Shmuel Tsur.
	   In an interview with Israel Television Thursday, Tsur said he
would personally deal with any complaints regarding the fund. He
insisted that the fund works to improve a patient's situation as
much as possible.
	   ``The policy is to give, not to save,'' Tsur said.
	   Jonathan Lemberger, head of a support organization for Holocaust
survivors, said the situation was symptomatic of a wider problem.
He also said the state was withholding other Holocaust reparation
money, including the legacies of survivors who died without heirs.
	   ``The mental patients' accounts are only the tip of the
iceberg,'' he said.

Daimler boosts estimate of benefits from Chrysler merger
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: US-Daimler-Chrysler &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   STUTTGART, Germany (AP) _ Daimler-Benz estimated Thursday that
its merger with U.S. automaker Chrysler will save the two companies
5.4 billion marks (dlrs 3.1 billion) over three to five years.
	   The savings are expected primarily from the pooling of
technology and know-how, Daimler said in a news release summarizing
a comprehensive merger report.
	   The figure compares to the rough estimate of 5 billion marks
(dlrs 2.8 billion) given by the companies when they announced in
May they would merge to create the world's third-largest automaker.
	   The deal, planned for November or December, has been valued at
about dlrs 38 billion.
	   The two companies filed a merger report with regulators in the
United States on Thursday, and were to file another one with German
regulators on Saturday. Both are aimed at providing details of the
deal to shareholders, who will vote on the merger in both countries
on Sept. 18.
	   The deal already has leapt its most significant regulatory
hurdles, receiving approval from the U.S. Federal Trade Commission
and European Union regulators.
	   Daimler said its company is being valued at 110 billion marks
(dlrs 61.1 billion) _ or 188.55 marks (dlrs 104.75) a share _ for
the deal. Chrysler is valued at 82.3 billion marks (dlrs 45.7
billion), or 119.32 marks (dlrs 66.29) a share.
	   Daimler also announced the deal's share exchange ratio, updated
since the merger was announced in May because of additional shares
issued by Daimler.
	   The new ratio, which is based on the two companies' values, is
0.624 shares in the merged company for each Chrysler share, up from
the 0.547 ratio announced in May.
	   Daimler shareholders arbitrarily were chosen as the group that
would trade one-to-one for shares in the new company.
	   As part of its computation of the two companies' values, Daimler
estimated their earnings over the next few years if they were to
remain apart.
	   Daimler said it could expect its operating profit to climb to
10.2 billion marks (dlrs 5.76 billion) in 2000, up from the 6.2
billion (dlrs 3.48 billion) forecast for this year.
	   It estimated Chrysler profits at dlrs 6.3 billion marks (dlrs
3.54 billion) in 2000, up from 5.6 billion marks (dlrs 3.15
billion) this year.

Fighting boils over into war threats against Rwanda
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: For AMs. RECASTS to UPDATE with color from protest, comments
from party official in Uvira, details of fighting in eastern and
western Congo, Britain's warning to its nationals. Re-writes

 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   KINSHASA, Congo (AP) _ Eerily reminiscent of Congo President
Laurent Kabila's rebel march to power last year, signs emerged
Thursday that Tutsi rebels and Rwandan soldiers were advancing
across this vast, divided African nation.
	   Embattled by the widening conflict, Kabila's government
threatened to wage war against neighboring Rwanda, which it accused
of masterminding the uprising.
	   Government spokesman Didier Mumenge warned that Congo would
``extend the war into Rwanda'' unless the international community
pressured the tiny country to withdraw Rwandan troops allegedly
deployed in Congo.
	   Congo's Justice Minister Mwenze Kongolo also pledged in a CNN
International broadcast to retaliate against Kabila's one-time
ally.
	   ``We are moving back to Rwanda,'' Kongolo said. ``This war
started in Rwanda and it is going to end in Rwanda.''
	   The rebels are believed to include Banyamulenge _ Congolese
Tutsi fighters _ and Rwandan soldiers who remained in Congo 14
months after playing a key role in Kabila's victory over longtime
Zairian dictator Mobutu Sese Seko last year.
	   Rwanda has repeatedly denied involvement in the conflict.
	   The mutineers were making gains from east to west in a strategy
resembling the early days of Kabila's eight-month march to power
that ended with Mobutu's ouster.
	   Key rebel gains in eastern Congo included the cities of Bukavu
and Goma near the border with Rwanda, which were reportedly seized
Wednesday. Fighting continued Thursday in the city of Kisangani
further into the interior, according to aid workers, government and
rebel sources.
	   The town of Uvira south of Bukavu was apparently calm Thursday
afternoon following a day of fighting that cost the lives of about
30 Congolese Tutsi fighters known as Banyamulenge, according to
Joseph Mutambo, deputy leader of a new rebel-linked political party
formed there.
	   About 20 tanker trucks crossed the border into neighboring
Burundi, which had been temporarily closed as the fighting raged in
Uvira.
	   More than 100 Banyamulenge troops fled the fighting into Zambia
earlier this week, Zambia said on Thursday.
	   The locus of fighting appeared to be moving westward.
	   On the opposite end of the country, gun battles continued in the
Atlantic coastline town of Muanda and the nearby village of Kitona,
Rwandan radio and Congolese government officials said.
	   That fighting erupted after a group of rebels landed a hijacked
plane Monday in Kitona, which is adjacent to a government military
base. Analysts believed the rebels were attempting a pincer
movement on the capital of Kinshasa.
	   Ethnic bitterness at Congolese Tutsis and their cousins in the
Rwandan military boiled over in Kinshasa at a demonstration by
about 5,000 protesters who called for guns to join the fight
against the Rwandans.
	   ``Give us weapons to go to Rwanda'', demonstrators sang, shaking
tree leaves and some carrying banners which read: ``We will make
Rwanda the 12th province of Congo.''
	   The demonstrators, mostly students and supporters of Kabila's
ruling party, held aloft two stuffed effigies bearing the images of
former leading government officials _ both Tutsis _ who have
apparently joined the renegades.
	   Two goats representing the defected leaders were sacrificed at
the end of the protest.
	   The two officials were Deogratias Bugera, a senior government
confidante of Kabila who disappeared from the capital last week and
former foreign minister Bizima Karaha, who was said to be in the
eastern town of Goma with rebels who captured the town.
	   Three South African ministers were expected to fly to Congo's
southern city of Lubumbashi on Friday to meet with Kabila to
discuss the hostilities, South African Foreign Minister Alfred Nzo
said on Thursday.
	   Zimbabwe, which is supplying 10 military advisors to Kabila's
government according to a Harare newspaper, has said it plans to
host a mini-summit of regional leaders Friday or Saturday over the
conflict.
	   Britain on Thursday urged its citizens to leave the Congo
because of the risk of a serious escalation in fighting. France and
the United States had earlier warned their nationals to leave. The
U.N. evacuated all 77 non-essential staff and their families early
Thursday from Kinshasa to Abidjan, Ivory Coast. About 20 U.N.
workers remained in the capital.

South African judge condemns police slayings
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   JOHANNESBURG, South Africa (AP) _ A judge said police in South
Africa are being ``hunted like unprotected game,'' declaring that
1,015 officers had been killed since 1994, a newspaper reported
Thursday.
	   Judge Theo Grobbelaar made his comments while sentencing a
35-year-old man to 65 years in jail for murdering a police sergeant
in Pretoria, the administrative capital an hour north of here.
	   Kobane Makena was convicted of killing Sgt. Nathaniel Roets as
the officer stopped him unloading stolen goods into a car. Makena
also was convicted of robbery and burglary.
	   ``The public is sick and tired of any form of crime and I accept
that members of the police are also sick and tired of being hunted
like unprotected game,'' Grobbelaar said, according to The Star of
Johannesburg.
	   ``If people choose to murder members of the police, the courts
can have no mercy,'' he said.
	   Grobbelaar said 558 of the slain officers were killed while
off-duty.
	   Crime across South Africa has skyrocketed since all-race
elections in 1994.
	   On Thursday, the head of South Africa's national police force
said the country is making gains in the fight against crime.
	   ``In 20 major crime categories, levels of crime have either
stabilized or declined,'' said police chief Meyer Kahn.
	   However, bad moral, ineffectiveness, drunkenness and absenteeism
continue to plague the police force, he said.

Iraq asks Arab League for support in its new standoff
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   CAIRO, Egypt (AP) _ Iraq asked the Arab League on Thursday for
support in its new dispute with U.N. weapons inspectors, Egypt's
official Middle East News Agency reported.
	   ``Iraq always looks for a supporting Arab stand that strengthens
Arab determination and the (Arab nations') common national
security,'' MENA quoted Iraq's ambassador to the Arab League, Nabil
Najm, as saying.
	   Najm made the comments after he gave the Arab League's acting
secretary-general a copy of the letter which Iraq's Deputy Prime
Minister Tariq Aziz sent to the Security Council president on
Wednesday, MENA added.
	   Aziz's letter explains why Iraqi President Saddam Hussein froze
cooperation with U.N. inspectors to protest eight years of economic
sanctions against his country. The decision has ignited a fresh
dispute with the inspectors, who are charged with eliminating
Iraq's weapons of mass destruction.
	   MENA quoted Najm as saying that Iraq is working to rally ``Arab
and international support for its (Iraq's) fair stance and lifting
the injustice imposed on it.''
	   He warned that there will be no security or stability in the
region while the sanctions remain in place.
	   The sanctions were imposed after Iraq's 1990 invasion of Kuwait.
The oil-rich emirate was liberated seven months later by a
U.S.-lead coalition in the 1991 Gulf War.

U.S., Bulgarian troops end humanitarian exercise
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   SOFIA, Bulgaria (AP) _ American and Bulgarian engineering troops
Thursday ended a joint exercise in which they rebuilt a hospital in
western Bulgaria.
	   The exercise, which was under NATO's Partnership for Peace
program, included 207 U.S. servicemen and women from U.S. Army
European Command and members of the 194th Engineering Brigade of
the Tennessee National Guard, as well as 218 servicemen from
Bulgaria's engineering troops.
	   Participants thoroughly repaired the municipal hospital in the
town of Tran, 85 kilometers (53 miles) west of Sofia.
	   The renewed building has a capacity of 120 beds and twenty
cabinets and will serve 6,300 people who live in Tran and the near
56 villages.
	   ``The bilateral exercise proved that the officers and sergeants
can handle not only weapons and combat equipment, but can also work
with construction materials,'' said Bulgarian Defence Minister
Georgi Ananiev.

Key Cabinet posts changed in Pakistan
</HEADLINE>

 &UR; By DONNA BRYSON &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   ISLAMABAD, Pakistan (AP) _ Pakistani Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif
named new men Thursday to direct the key areas of finance and
foreign affairs as his government struggled to ward off economic
collapse and repair international ties strained by nuclear tests.
	   An information ministry spokesman confirmed the long-rumored
changes late Thursday. Former Finance Minister Sartaj Aziz was
shifted to foreign affairs, while respected economist Hafeez Pasha
was named special finance adviser. Pasha is not in parliament, and
so could not be named minister.
	   The outspoken Gohar Ayub, who as foreign minister had had tough
words for neighboring India after it conducted nuclear tests in
May, was moved to minister of water and power. That post is
particularly important with Pakistan pledging to step up its
privatization drive by selling off state utilities, and following
disputes over tariffs with private power providers.
	   Former water and power minister Raja Nadir Pervaiz took the
until-now vacant post as power of communications minister.
	   Pakistan answered India's tests with a test of its own in May,
and both countries were internationally condemned. They both also
were hit with economic sanctions by the United States, Japan and
other industrialized nations. India has withstood the sanctions
relatively well, while Pakistan's already battered economy was hit
hard.
	   Economic observers have speculated Pakistan may have to default
on or delay payments on its dlrs 30 billion foreign debt.
	   Aziz told the private Pakistani NNI news agency that his move
from finance to foreign should not be seen as a judgment that he
had mishandled the economy. He said the move had been in the works
since April, before the May nuclear tests brought the country's
economic troubles to a head.
	   Yaseen Lakhani, head of the Karachi Stock Exchange, said Aziz's
finance background will help Pakistan as it tries to persuade
foreign countries and international lending agencies to lift
anti-nuclear economic sanctions.
	   The announcement came hours after stock markets had closed.
Lakhani said he expected a muted reaction Friday morning, because
the changes had been expected, and because traders were more
worried about factors such as fear of war with neighboring India
and uncertainty over sanctions than '' a few in-house movements in
the ministries.''
	   Ilyas Bilour, president of the Federation of Pakistan Chambers
of Commerce and Industry, expressed respect for newly appointed
finance adviser Pasha, but noted his job would not be easy.
	   ``He's an economist, a Ph.D.. Let's hope he can deliver the
goods,'' Bilour said.
	   Pasha, who had been deputy planning commission chief, has a
masters in economics from Cambridge University and his doctorate
from Stanford University. He has held important academic posts in
Pakistan and is known _ and respected _ as a technocrat rather than
a politician.
	   Pasha served as caretaker finance minister in 1993 and deputy
planning chief since 1996.

Lawyer appeals for Leeson release after cancer discovery
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: RECASTS and UPDATES throughout with new material from
Singapore lawyer, British cancer expert &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ Nick Leeson's lawyer has appealed to Singaporean
authorities to free the imprisoned securities trader on
compassionate grounds following the discovery that he is suffering
from colon cancer.
	   Singapore attorney John Koh told the British news agency Press
Association that he had filed a plea for early release of the
31-year-old trader, whose futures dealings brought down Britain's
oldest merchant bank.
	   A statement from Leeson's London-based law firm Kingsley Napley
said he was diagnosed Aug. 5 with cancer of the colon, which has
spread to his lymph nodes.
	   Leeson has been taken to Changi Prison hospital in Singapore,
where he has served about 2 1/2 years of a 6 1/2 year sentence for
fraud offenses stemming from the 1995 crash of Barings bank.
	   ``An application has been made in order to allow Mr. Leeson to
return to Britain. We cannot say how long that will take or indeed
whether it will be successful,'' Koh told Press Association in a
phone call from the Indonesian capital, Jakarta.
	   Under Singaporean law, sentences can be commuted only by a
direct pardon from the state's president, Ong Teng Chong, who is
also suffering from cancer of the lymphatic system.
	   A spokesman for Changi Prison told Press Association that no
information on a pardon request was available, but added that pleas
based on extreme illness could be expected to be considered as
quickly as possible.
	   The Singapore Prisons Department said in a statement faxed to
The Associated Press that Leeson ``is receiving treatment.''
	   Professor Gordon McVie, director general of Britain's Cancer
Research Campaign, said Leeson needs urgent surgery to prevent the
cancer from spreading.
	   ``After the cancer breaches the wall of the colon to the lymph
nodes, it means that a more extensive operation is required. You do
not just take out the piece of colon but the whole chain of lymph
nodes,'' he said.
	   Leeson's London solicitor, Stephen Pollard, said he was waiting
for a prognosis on the seriousness of his condition.
	   The Foreign Office said officials from the British High
Commission in Singapore were visiting Leeson daily to monitor his
condition. It said all steps to secure his release were being
handled by his lawyers.
	   Leeson lost dlrs 1.38 billion speculating on Asian stock markets
from his base in Singapore. British investigators blamed ``woefully
inadequate'' financial controls within Barings and faulted the Bank
of England for not keeping close enough tabs on the bank.
	   Barings was taken over by the Dutch banking and insurance
company, ING Group.
	   Leeson's mother died of cancer when he was a teen-ager. His
father, William, who lives in Watford, England, said he learned of
his son's illness Wednesday from the lawyers.
	   Lisa Leeson, 30, who has not seen her ex-husband in more than a
year and is due to remarry later this month, expressed ``deep
shock'' at the news of his illness.

	   ISLAMABAD, Pakistan (AP) _ Pakistani Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif
named new men Thursday to direct the key areas of finance and
foreign affairs as his government struggled to ward off economic
collapse and repair international ties strained by nuclear tests.
	   An information ministry spokesman confirmed the long-rumored
changes late Thursday. Former Finance Minister Sartaj Aziz was
shifted to foreign affairs, while respected economist Hafeez Pasha
was named special finance adviser. Pasha is not in parliament, and
so could not be named minister.
	   The outspoken Gohar Ayub, who as foreign minister had had
undiplomatically tough words for neighboring India after it
conducted nuclear tests in May, was moved to minister of water and
power. That post is particularly important with Pakistan pledging
to step up its privatization drive by selling off state utilities,
and following disputes over tariffs with private power providers.
	   Former water and power minister Raja Nadir Pervaiz took the
until-now vacant communications ministry. In other changes, Sardar
Yaqub Nasir, who faces corruption charges, was dropped as minister
for railways and not yet replaced; Shahid Khaqan Abbasi was named
to the vacant defense production ministry; and Sheikh Rasheed was
stripped of his sports and culture portfolio but left in charge of
labor.
	   Pakistan answered India's tests with test of its own in May, and
both countries were internationally condemned. They both also were
hit with economic sanctions by the United States, Japan and other
industrialized nations. India has withstood the sanctions
relatively well, while Pakistan's already battered economy was hit
hard.
	   Economic observers have speculated Pakistan may have to default
on or delay payments on its dlrs 30 billion foreign debt.
	   Aziz told the private Pakistani NNI news agency that his move
from finance to foreign should not be seen as a judgment that he
had mishandled the economy. He said the move had been in the works
since April, before the May nuclear tests brought the country's
economic troubles to a head.
	   Yaseen Lakhani, head of the Karachi Stock Exchange, said Aziz's
finance background will help Pakistan as it tries to persuade
foreign countries and international lending agencies to lift
anti-nuclear economic sanctions.
	   The announcement came hours after stock markets closed. Lakhani
said he expected a muted reaction Friday morning, because the
changes had been expected, and because traders were more worried
about factors such as fears of war with India and uncertainty over
sanctions than ``a few in-house movements in the ministries.''
	   Ilyas Bilour, president of the Federation of Pakistan Chambers
of Commerce and Industry, expressed respect for newly appointed
finance adviser Pasha, but noted his job would not be easy.
	   ``Let's hope he can deliver the goods,'' Bilour said.
	   Pasha has held important academic posts in Pakistan and is known
_ and respected _ as a technocrat rather than a politician. He
served as caretaker finance minister in 1993 and has been deputy
planning chief since 1996.

Fighting lessens in two Kosovo areas

<TEXT>
	   PRISTINA, Yugoslavia (AP) _ While fighting persisted Thursday in
two areas of Kosovo at a lower level than before, international
relief workers worried about how to care for some 200,000 Kosovo
refugees.
	   ``The situation in Kosovo has deteriorated significantly and can
now only be described as a humanitarian disaster,'' said a
statement from Carol Bellamy, executive director of the U.N.
Children's Fund (UNICEF).
	   ``The principal victims of the escalating violence are children
and women. Some 200,000 people have been displaced facing daily
terror, the loss of their homes, severe malnutrition and a range of
health crises,'' the statement said.
	   ``If concerted and effective international initiative is not
taken soon, world leaders risk seeing the situation in Kosovo
escalate to grotesque levels of violence and brutality,'' it added.
	   The refugees have been displaced by the current offensive
launched by Serbian forces seeking to push back and defeat the
underground Kosovo Liberation Army fighting for the independence
for Kosovo.
	   Kosovo is a province in southern Serbia where ethnic Albanians
represent 90 percent of the population. Serbia and the smaller
republic of Montenegro make up what is left of Yugoslavia.
	   Earlier in the day, Serb sources said there was fierce fighting
along the main Pristina-Prizren road near the village of Crnoljevo,
southwest of Kosovo's capital, and clashes continued near the
besieged village Junik, close the Albanian border.
	   But reporters traveling in the countryside Thursday got the
impression that the Serbian campaign was gradually winding down.
Their observations appeared to be confirmed by a report of the
ethnic Albanian Kosovo Information Center.
	   It said fighting continued in the border area around Junik and
near Djakovica, but with much less intensity than on previous days.
	   International aid agencies continued efforts to care for the
tens of thousands of refugees scattered throughout the province.
	   Thousands were hiding in the hills around Negrovce, a village 25
kilometers (15 miles) west of Pristina, in ``extremely difficult
conditions,'' with no shelter and daytime temperatures up to 38
degrees Celsius (100 F), a statement by the Doctors Without Borders
group issued in Geneva said.
	   It said two mobile teams are traveling through Kosovo daily in
search of safe places where clinics can be set up with local
doctors' help and with a capacity for 350 consultations daily.
	   Patients are suffering above all from diarrhea, respiratory and
skin infections, as well as stress-related problems, the statement
said, adding the teams are struggling with access problems.
	   Meanwhile, family members of more than 100 Serbs presumed
kidnapped by ethnic Albanians in Kosovo met Thursday with U.S. and
Red Cross officials, demanding help to get their relatives released
or at least accounted for.
	   Beatrix Weber, of the International Committee of the Red Cross
office in Pristina, said the organization was actively working on
cases of 40 missing Serbs, presumed abducted by separatist rebels,
out of a registered total of 138.
	   Weber said that ICRC lists of missing since fighting escalated
earlier this year include 400 Kosovo Albanians, but she advised
``utmost caution'' regarding the number as it was still being
checked.
	   Also Thursday, the European Union approved 5 million European
currency units (dlrs 5.5 million) in aid for Kosovo. The EU
Commission said the funds will enable the United Nations and
humanitarian groups to take urgent steps to help people fleeing the
fighting.

D'Amato calls on Switzerland to unblock Kosovo accounts
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with Swiss ambassador's reply in 7th, 8th grafs. &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   BERN, Switzerland (AP) _ A U.S. senator has called on
Switzerland to unblock accounts frozen amid suspicions they were
used to channel cash to Kosovo independence fighters, Swiss Foreign
Ministry officials said Thursday.
	   The ministry confirmed a report in the Berner Zeitung daily that
Sen. Alfonse D'Amato, a leading critic of Switzerland in the
controversy over Holocaust-era assets, wrote in a letter to the
Swiss embassy in Washington that he didn't understand the
authorities' action.
	   He called on the Swiss ambassador to the United States, Alfred
Defago, to provide an explanation, saying people in Kosovo needed
support.
	   Swiss authorities last week froze an account held by the Kosovo
Information Center and another run by the Popular Movement of
Kosovo, a group supporting the Kosovo Liberation Army.
	   D'Amato wrote of the information center's humanitarian
character, the foreign ministry said.
	   Xhafer Shatri, a Geneva-based spokesman for the center, close to
moderate ethnic Albanian leader Ibrahim Rugova, insisted last week
the money had always been used for ``humanitarian, social, cultural
and educational purposes.'' He didn't say how much the account
contained.
	   Defago defended the Swiss action in a letter to D'Amato, Swiss
Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Yasmine Chatila said later Thursday.
	   He said the Swiss move was in line with last month's call by
major powers, including the United States, for governments to take
urgent steps to prevent funds collected from ethnic Albanians
living abroad being sent to finance the KLA.
	   Juerg Blaser, spokesman for the Federal Prosecutor's Office,
said Switzerland wants to free money for humanitarian use as soon
as possible, but must first establish whether that is its intended
use.
	   He declined to say whether investigations had revealed any new
information.
	   Last week, Blaser said a Geneva location had been searched and
documents were confiscated, but declined to give further details.
The raid was part of an operation in which police also searched the
homes of three PMK members in eastern Switzerland.

	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Striking ambulance workers in the eastern port
city of Vladivostok have turned down 186 calls for help since their
protest began earlier this week, news reports said Thursday.
	   There are usually 30 ambulance teams on duty, but only four are
currently on the job. They are responding only to life-threatening
situations, calls involving children under age 2, and pregnant
women going into labor, the ITAR-Tass and Interfax news agencies
reported.
	   Other patients are either referred to outpatient clinics or
consulted over the telephone, the reports said.
	   The ambulance workers are demanding four months worth of unpaid
wages.
	   The Vladivostok prosecutor's office opened a criminal
investigation into the local government's failure to finance the
ambulance service, and urged striking workers to return to the job,
Interfax reported.
	   On the eastern island of Sakhalin, striking miners allowed a
limited coal delivery to reach a key power plant after a nearly
two-week blockade.
	   The miners, who are demanding eight months' back wages,
negotiated a truce Tuesday, agreeing to allow enough coal through
to keep the plant running. But some protesters refused to leave the
tracks for another day.
	   Late Wednesday night, the first delivery of some 1,500 tons of
coal loaded on 25 rail cars was allowed to go through, ITAR-Tass
reported.
	   Local authorities have accused the miners of causing serious
economic damage by interrupting preparations for winter, ITAR-Tass
said.
	   Sakhalin, with a population of 650,000, depends on the plant for
its power. Authorities have been rationing electricity out of fear
the plant would run out of fuel if coal deliveries did not arrive.
	   Deputy Prime Minister Boris Nemtsov announced Thursday that the
government will stop financing mining regions where unpaid workers
block railroads, ITAR-Tass and Interfax reported.
	   On the eastern Kamchatka peninsula, about 100 municipal workers
blocked a highway used for transporting salmon caught off
Kamchatka's west coast, Interfax said. More than 30 trucks loaded
with fish have been stalled on the road by Thursday evening, it
said.
	   Russian air traffic controllers called off a strike that had
been threatened for next week. The government promised to pay its
dlrs 63 million debt to them by Sept. 1, Russian news agencies
said.
	   However, the nationwide Union of Labor called for a nationwide
strike on Oct. 7.
	   Protests over back wages have swept over Russia in recent
months. But the protests have rarely been coordinated, and workers'
pay is still arriving months late.
	   Millions of Russian workers receive their salaries months late
due to a chronic cycle of non-payments that has plagued the country
for years.

	   MAPUTO, Mozambique (AP) _ Germany has agreed to donate 26.7
million marks (dlrs 14.8 million) for Mozambican energy and road
rehabilitation projects.
	   The agreement was signed in Maputo Thursday by the Mozambican
minister of foreign affairs and cooperation, Leonardo Simao, and
the German ambassador, Rol-Rudiger Zirpel.
	   Zirpel said the agreement, which is designed to assist
Mozambique in restructuring its economy wrecked during 16 years of
civil war, was the result of recent negotiations between the two
governments.
	   Last year Germany provided Mozambique with 35 million marks
(dlrs 19.4 million) in aid.
	   -----
	   MASERU, Lesotho (AP) _ Riot police deployed at Parliament
Thursday as crowds of opposition protesters gathered outside the
gate, preventing the legislature from meeting.
	   It was the second day of demonstrations by protesters alleging
the May election, in which the Lesotho Congress for Democracy
returned to office, were rigged.
	   The angry mob brandished sticks and shouted anti-government
slogans.
	   -----
	   HARARE, Zimbabwe (AP) _ Retailers and manufacturers Thursday met
Commerce and Industry Minister Nathan Shamuyarira to seek 20
percent increases in food prices after the Government increased
prices of petroleum fuels by 13 to 20 percent.
	   ``We acknowledge that the food industry has sent in their
proposals on increases. But as the situation stands there is no
justification which we see to justify any price hikes and, as such,
we rule out any increases in prices of basic commodities,'' said
Shamuyarira, who was not expected to announce cabinet's final
decision for several weeks.
	   Promulgation of new fuel prices was believed to have been timed
to coincide with arrival of a six member International Monetary
Fund delegation to appraise Government compliance with targets set
under a dlrs 176 million budget support agreement.
	   In January, inflation triggered three days of food riots in
which at least eight people died. The Zimbabwe Congress of Trades
Unions is threatening a further five-day national strike to protest
declining living standards which, it alleges, result from economic
mismanagement.

	   KABUL, Afghanistan (AP) _ Nearly 100 Taliban soldiers have died
in the last 24 hours battling an opposition alliance in northern
Afghanistan, a spokesman for the alliance said Thursday.
	   Anti-Taliban spokesman Abdullah, who uses one name only, said
his forces killed 100 Taliban, recaptured territory near the key
northern city of Mazar-e-Sharif in heavy fighting, repelled a
Taliban attack in the region, and captured the strategic town of
Borka to the south. He did not mention any alliance casualties.
	   Taliban radio reported later that the northern alliance was
repulsed in the fighting. Independent confirmation was not
immediately possible.
	   If confirmed, the capture of Borka, 200 kilometers (120 miles)
southeast of Mazar-e-Sharif, would relieve pressure on anti-Taliban
leader Ahmed Shah Masood's stronghold in the Panjshir Valley just
north of the Afghan capital of Kabul. Abdullah, speaking by
telephone from London, said the attack on Borka was ``very
massive.''

Legionnaires' disease kills 4 in Paris region, sickens 16 others
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   PARIS (AP) _ Health authorities on Thursday said that 20 people
have contracted Legionnaires' disease in the Paris region since
June and four of the victims have died. But investigators are so
far unable to locate a source of the bacteria striking tourists and
natives alike.
	   At least nine European tourists -- seven British and two
Scandinavians -- are among those who have been stricken by the
disease since June 6, according to a statement by the National
Public Health Center.
	   At least two of those who died were tourists, according to the
General Direction of Health.
	   The latest death, announced Thursday evening, was the first new
case of the disease since July 3. The victim died on July 31, said
a statement by the General Direction of Health.
	   Half of the 20 cases were contracted June 15-21, a statement
said.
	   Testing of water and selected air conditioning units focused on
Paris' 9 district, where 13 of the victims spent some time, and the
2nd district, officials said. The 9th district covers the major
Paris department stores and the Opera Garnier, and attracts
numerous tourists.
	   In addition, samples of hot water were taken from a hotel where
two of the tourists stayed, said the statement, but the samples
showed no evidence of the bacteria.
	   The British Health Service helped with the investigation.
	   ``At this date, neither the environmental nor epidemiologic
investigation has allowed the identification of a common source of
contamination,'' said the statement.
	   The Legionella pneumophila bacteria that cause the disease are
found in water or soil, and many of the outbreaks have been
associated with air-conditioning systems.
	   The disease, which can cause pneumonia, became known as
Legionnaires' disease after a 1976 outbreak among people attending
an American Legion convention in Philadelphia.
	   Symptoms include fatigue, muscle aches, headaches, a dry cough,
a high fever, and sometimes abdominal pain and diarrhea. Some
infected people have only mild respiratory problems, but more
severe cases can cause death.

 &UR; EDS: UPDATES with Italy-Tunisia accord, report saying Rome to give
Tunisia aid to create jobs in return for discouraging immigrant
exodus &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   ROME (AP) _ Italy sent 143 Pakistanis home Thursday in the first
mass repatriation since thousands of would-be immigrants began
reaching Italy's shores this summer and worked out a deal with
Tunisia to discourage the exodus.
	   Many who have landed in Italy came from that North African
country. Italy has signed similar agreements with about a dozen
nations, including Morocco last month.
	   All the details of a series of accords the Italian and Tunisian
foreign ministers were working on after meetings here this week
were not immediately available.
	   But the Italian news agency ANSA reported that Rome had promised
Tunis about dlrs 86 million in development aid through 2000.
	   Earlier in the day, other news reports said the aid was aimed at
creating jobs in Tunisia so Tunisians would be less likely to try
to enter Italy illegally in hopes of finding work here or elsewhere
in Europe. In return, Tunisia was expected to cooperate in helping
to identify the illegal arrivals and to take them back.

Newspaper accuses Russian Central Bank chief of unauthorized

withdrawal &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ A newspaper on Thursday accused the head of
Russia's Central Bank of making an unauthorized transaction last
month that drove the country to the brink of bankruptcy.
	   The Central Bank and Finance Ministry immediately denied the
accusation and said they would sue the paper, Nezavisimaya Gazeta,
which is controlled by a powerful banker who has previously feuded
with top Kremlin officials.
	   ``The Central Bank of Russia and the Finance Ministry intend to
jointly file suit against Nezavisimaya Gazeta,'' the two government
organizations said in a joint statement.
	   The article claims that Central Bank Chairman Sergei Dubinin
withdrew 8.7 billion rubles (dlrs 1.4 billion) from the Finance
Ministry's account on July 20. As a result, the paper claims, the
government defaulted on some of its bond obligations.
	   The article included a copy of what it said was a letter from
Finance Minister Mikhail Zadornov to President Boris Yeltsin
informing him of the situation. The newspaper said the letter
prompted the president's abrupt return to Moscow from his vacation
last week.
	   The article did not say why Dubinin made the alleged withdrawal,
but offered several possible motives.
	   The Nezavisimaya Gazeta daily is owned by magnate Boris
Berezovsky, one of Russia's most powerful bankers whose interests
range from the media to oil. He has close ties to Yeltsin's inner
circle, but has feuded publicly with some of Yeltsin's top aides
over economic policy.
	   He played an important role in Yeltsin's 1996 re-election
campaign, mobilizing business support for the candidate and
arranging favorable television coverage, winning a Kremlin post in
return. He currently serves as Executive Secretary of the
Commonwealth of Independent States, a high-profile job coordinating
relations between former Soviet states.

Scientists develop better morning-after contraceptive pill
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: EMBARGOED by source until 0001 GMT, Friday August 7. &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   GENEVA (AP) _ Scientists say trials of a new morning-after pill
show a lower failure rate and fewer side effects than existing
emergency contraception, the World Health Organization said Friday.
	   In a study published in this week's edition of British medical
journal The Lancet, researchers say large-scale trials of
levonorgestrel confirmed it outperforms the most commonly used
contraceptive pill, known in medical circles as the Yuzpe regimen.
	   Levonorgestrel, a type of hormone, is part of the Yuzpe regimen.
But research has shown that the hormone might be more effective
when used on its own, the study said.
	   To prove this on a large scale, a team of scientists working
under the auspices of a WHO research program conducted a study
involving 1,998 women with an average age of 27 in 21 centers
worldwide.
	   ``This study has clearly demonstrated that levonorgestrel
outperforms the Yuzpe method,'' said Helena von Hertzen, the WHO
program's medical officer.
	   ``We believe these findings will persuade health services
already offering emergency contraception to start offering
levonorgestrel instead of or in addition to the Yuzpe method.''
	   In their study, the researchers found the percentage of women
who became pregnant despite taking the treatment was higher in the
group under the Yuzpe regimen than it was among those who received
levonorgestrel.
	   Calculations made by the researchers of the number of
pregnancies expected if no treatment had been given demonstrated
that levonorgestrel prevented 85 percent, compared to 57 percent
with the Yuzpe regimen.
	   In both groups, the earlier the treatment was started, the lower
the pregnancy rate, the researchers said.
	   Among women who started treatment within 24 hours of having
unprotected sex, levonorgestrel prevented 95 percent of potential
pregnancies, compared with 77 percent for the Yuzpe method.
	   Levonorgestrel was also more effective when applied up to 48
hours and later. Researchers found it was much better tolerated by
women than the Yuzpe regimen.
	   Women subjected to both methods reported the same side effects,
including nausea, vomiting, dizziness, fatigue, headache, breast
tenderness and lower abdominal pain.
	   But those women who took levonorgestrel reported experiencing
each of these side effects far less frequently than those under the
Yuzpe regimen, researchers said.
	   Paul Van Look, director of the WHO program, said a variation of
the levonorgestrel pill has already been marketed in Hungary.
Applications for registration have been granted in Kenya and Sri
Lanka.
	   But the product hasn't yet been registered elsewhere, he said.

Netanyahu calls on Arafat to condemn attack
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By DINA KRAFT &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu called on
Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat Thursday to condemn a grisly
double killing of two Jewish settlers.
	   ``Arafat should condemn and oppose such crimes,'' Netanyahu
said.
	   Arafat's aides said the Palestinian leader would be prepared to
condemn the West Bank attack in the framework of an interview put
was not planning any public statement on the killings.
	   With tensions between the sides running high one day after the
killings, Israeli and Palestinian negotiators did not resume talks
aimed at solving a long overdue Israeli troop withdrawal from the
West Bank.
	   Netanyahu however said he wanted discussions to continue with
negotiators placing a stronger emphasis on Israel's security
concerns.
	   Negotiators held their last round of direct talks over an
Israeli troop withdrawal one day before the attack and the talks
have not resumed.
	   The sides have been haggling over the scope of an withdrawal as
laid out in a U.S. peace proposal, with little progress. The
Palestinians accepted the plan but Israel has not, saying a 13
percent withdrawal would harm its security.
	   Both sides have asked several times for further American
intervention to reach a deal on the withdrawal.
	   Thursday, negotiators took their cases to Jordanian Crown Prince
Hassan in Amman, Jordan.
	   Chief Palestinian negotiator Saeb Erekat said he visited Hassan
to ask for Jordan's help in convincing the United States to
pressure Israel to accept its initiative.
	   ``We have traveled all the roads we possibly could with the
Israeli side through the series of meetings,'' Erekat said, ``But
the Israelis presented ideas that in no way comply with the signed
agreements or the American initiative,'' Erekat said.
	   However, Israeli Public Security Minister Avigdor Kahalani
delivered a message to the prince that Israel and the Palestinians
were close to resolving problems holding up the troop withdrawal
from the West Bank.
	   Settler leaders say Netanyahu's latest pullback offer _ rejected
Tuesday by Arafat as giving the Palestinians too little land _
instead concedes too much territory, leaving settlements vulnerable
to attack.
	   Netanyahu met with settler leaders Thursday to talk about areas
Israel may pullback from.
	   During a visit to the families of the two young men slain at
Wednesday, President Ezer Weizman said efforts to reach peace must
continue despite the attack.
	   ``I think the peace process is an important historic step. There
is a large controversy and of course this tragedy has not helped.
But we must show great strength and courage to continue with it
(the peace process),'' Weizman told reporters.
	   Two of the five Palestinian villages near Itzhar remained under
curfew Thursday as Israeli soldiers searched for suspects. Police
spokesman Ofir Sivan said no arrests have been made.

 &UR; By The Associated Press &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   Here are excerpts from editorials in publications in various
countries:
	    &UR; ___
	   Le Temps, Geneva, Switzerland, on South Africa's Truth and
Reconciliation Commission:
	   By setting up in 1995 a commission charged with investigating
violations of human rights perpetrated in the name of racial
segregation or its destruction, Nelson Mandela rejected a South
African version of the Nuremberg trials. ...
	   Of course, it has its imperfections.
	   The atrocities committed by the ANC and black movements may seem
to have been underestimated.
	   The whites have in part remained at arm's length from the Truth
and Reconciliation Commission's hearings, but their silence
generally doesn't signify contempt. Far from that.
	   The compensation promised to the victims has been late in
coming. The amnesty decreed, despite their admissions, to some real
serial killers has gone down badly in the gateways.
	   But ... the rainbow nation can be proud of an example to the
rest of the world, to other battlefields looking for salvation.
	    &UR; ___
	   Le Figaro, Paris, on the Tour de France:
	   The month of July started well: the grandiose World Cup victory
of France's soccer team, national euphoria and solidarity. The joy
and the confidence came back when the Tour de France began. But
this joy couldn't foresee the poison of the doping scandal.
	   The exclusion of the Festina team prompted by the admission of
doping by the team's director, Bruno Roussel, brought a cloud of
suspicion over the contest that has become a widely-watched
spectacle with its heroes, its myths and its tragedies.
	   But hidden inside the suspicion was hypocrisy.
	   Doping isn't a new problem. Since sport began, players have used
whatever means available to improve performance ... but today the
economic stakes are huge, the pace is frantic and new sporting
technology is being perfected every day. ...
	   It is high time to make the rules of the game clear and
reasonable. It's necessary to strengthen the fight against doping
not just for the spirit of fair play, but for the health of the
players.
	    &UR; ___
	   The Irish Times (Dublin), on Tour de France:
	   Few events in recent times have undermined the spirit of sport
as much as the 1998 Tour de France, which came to a shameful
conclusion in Paris yesterday. When 189 cyclists set out in Dublin
three weeks ago on one of the world's great sporting spectacles, no
one could have imagined that 21 days later cycling and its
outstanding exponents would be embroiled in arguably the most
shocking drug-related sports event ever. ...
	   Although the Tour and cycling have been at the center of drugs
scandals over the last 30 years, most supporters believed that it
was only the unscrupulous few who indulged in taking
performance-enhancing products. The almost daily arrests and drug
revelations of the past three weeks have exposed the sheer scale of
the doping problem in cycling, and sport in general. Riders and
team officials on the Tour have undermined the ethics of sport by
blithely claiming that their offenses didn't merit the thorough
investigations by French and Belgian police in their efforts to
uncover the depth of the problem. ...
	    &UR; ___
	   The Australian, on Cambodia:
	   Cambodia's motives in arresting Nuon Paet, the alleged killer in
1994 of three foreign backpackers ... may be suspect. Strongman Hun
Sen may have been driven by greater pressure than simple justice,
yet the arrest is welcome all the same. ...
	   The timing of the arrest _ just a week after the election in
which Hun Sen, himself a former Khmer Rouge deputy leader, emerged
as front-runner _ raised suspicions that it could be a trade-off
for international acceptance of the poll result. International
observers have given only lukewarm praise for the election process,
saying it was probably the best that could have been achieved in
the circumstances. There are serious allegations of electoral fraud
in the regions. But Hun Sen is now far more prepared to seek
international legitimacy following the outcry caused by his violent
ousting of co-prime minister Prince Norodom Ranariddh in July 1997.
...
	   With Cambodia increasingly reliant on donor nations, including
Australia, the arrest seems to signal that while Nuon Paet's
alleged crimes might seem minor to many Cambodians, their foreign
impact can no longer be ignored.
	    &UR; ___
	   La Stampa, Turin, Italy, on Milosevic and Kosovo:
	   The latest act of the Yugoslav tragedy seems to be an evil
repetition of the atrocities verified in the siege of Dubrovnik,
the destruction of Vukovar, the massacres of Sarajevo and
Srebrenica.
	   Kosovo has been transformed into a demolished, nightmarish
utopia, a shrine to a defunct Serbia that has 100,000 Serbs
besieged by about 2 million Albanians. Milosevic's war on Kosovo is
yet another ``fake civil war'' between opposing troops: the
``anti-terrorist'' Serbian policemen against the ``terrorist''
Kosovo Liberation Army. The ineffective attempts by these so-called
terrorists offer Milosevic a way to internationally justify his
real war: the one against the Albanian population. Uninterested in
frontal attacks with the rebels, the Serbs prefer to simply bomb
entire villages ...
	   The threat of NATO intervention has been revealed as a bluff.
... Milosevic has won many diplomatic battles and intends to play
his hand until the end, which may mean this: ethnically cleansing a
conspicuous part of Kosovo, making it Serb again through violence,
and abandoning the rest to Albania.

Ultranationalist calls for complete purge of Kosovo secessionists
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BELGRADE, Yugoslavia (AP) _ Vojislav Seselj, an ultranationalist
ally of Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic, called Thursday for
a thorough crackdown against militant separatists in the Serbian
Kosovo province.
	   ``No village must remain under their control,'' said Seselj,
referring to the underground Kosovo Liberation army fighting for
independence for Kosovo.
	   Seselj is currently a vice premier in the Serbian government
composed of Milosevic's Socialists and his ultranationalist Serbian
Radical Party. He led Serb paramilitary units in the wars in Bosnia
and Croatia.
	   ``There must be no hesitation ... there must be yielding to
pressures from Western powers who would dismember the territory of
Serbia,'' Seselj said, reiterating his earlier claims that the West
is too supportive of the Kosovo Albanian independence movement.
	   Serbian government forces, and to an extent the Yugoslav federal
army, have battled the KLA fiercely, forcing the guerrillas to
withdraw from parts of Kosovo they had controlled.
	   Seselj said the latest front-line successes of the government
forces might actually bring the two sides closer to negotiations,
long called for by the international community but never really
begun.
	   ``The terrorist option simply has no chance, and when everybody
realizes that, the road to dialogue will be open,'' he asserted.

Kucera, Fromberg advance to semifinals
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   AMSTERDAM, Netherlands (AP) _ Top-seeded Karol Kucera of
Slovakia dropped just three games Thursday in demolishing
compatriot Dominik Hrbaty 6-2, 6-1 in their Grolsch Open
quarterfinal.
	   Kucera faces a Saturday semifinal against the No. 6 seed,
Australian Richard Fromberg, who downed unseeded Romanian Adrian
Voinea earlier in the afternoon, 6-3, 6-4.
	   A chaotic second set saw Fromberg drop his own serve twice but
break Voinea's three times.
	   Kucera and Hrbaty are friends and doubles partners, but Kucera
gave no quarter, sending Hrbaty scurrying into the corners of the
court chasing angled drives.
	   As longer rallies developed it was the seventh-seeded Hrbaty who
tried to hit the ball harder and made the greater number of
unforced errors.
	   Kucera clinced the match after an almost flawless performance
from the baseline in just an hour and seven minutes.
	   Friday's third quarterfinal of this dlrs 500,000 ATP Tour clay
court tourney pits defending champion Slava Dosedel of the Czech
Republic, seeded eight this year, against Argentinian Mariano
Zabaleta.
	   Swede Magnus Norman contests the fourth semifinal place with
Spaniard Galo Blanco.

	   Dagens Nyheter, Stockholm, Sweden, on international court:
	   Kofi Annan welcomes the new international war crimes tribunal.
In Thursday's DN (op-ed page), he called it a ``gift of hope to
future generations.''
	   For the United Nations secretary-general it is central that the
world organization gets the project under way. The UN was founded
``as a stage in the worldwide fight against regimes that are guilty
of mass murder on a terrible scale,'' he wrote.
	   Annan does not hide under the chair the fact that the result was
a compromise. He would rather have seen the court get more
far-reaching powers and that `the great powers full support' would
be there from the beginning. The point is _ even if it wasn't
stated in the article _ mainly directed toward the United States,
which voted against the court out of concern that its own soldiers
would be put on trial. Annan nevertheless thinks that even the
Americans will, with time, come to ``see the value of this new,
important undertaking.''

	   The Jordan Times, Amman, on foreign investments in Jordan:
	   Ever since Al Hassan Industrial Estate in the northern city of
Irbid was designated as a Qualifying Industrial Zone (QIZ) in
March, not a single investor has applied for product
qualification-the ``golden opportunity'' of acquiring free trade
access to U.S. markets.
	   Instead, investors are exporting their products to the U.S.
using the general system for preferences which provides access to
certain products on the basis of reduced tariffs.
	   Therefore investors, who did not hesitate to pump their millions
in the QIZ, are trying to convince Israel to lower its input to 8
percent, but governments are taking their time in negotiating and
deciding on `investors' demands.
	   For years Jordan has suffered from a lack of direct foreign
investments, and local traders and industrialists have been
campaigning of a sluggish economy. But now they have cause to whine
no more. On the contrary, they should perceive the QIZ as a
comparative advantage added to the country's already inexpensive
labour and infrastructure.
	   Although foreign investments from the most sophisticated markets
can be seen scouting the QIZ, including international brand names,
Jordanian investors are just acting as spectators. It is about time
that they get to the business at hand with an open mind rather than
miss the boat again.
	    &UR; ___
	   The Straits Times, Singapore, on ASEAN:
	   The recent ASEAN (Association of Southeast Asian Nations)
foreign ministers' meetings in Manila may be best remembered for
the controversy over Thailand's ``flexible engagement'' proposal to
allow member states to criticize each other openly. ...
	   No ASEAN country other than the Philippines supported Thai
Foreign Minister Surin Pitsuwan's attempt to change the grouping's
long-standing principle of non-interference in each other's
policies. ...
	   The Western democracies, always ready to capitalize on any
opening whenever there is one, are prepared to latch onto the ASEAN
debate. U.S. Secretary of State Madeleine Albright ... waded right
into the debate to sanction ``flexible engagement'' as something
that should be done as a matter of course among ASEAN countries.
	   Democracy and openness were the buzzwords of her sermons in
Manila. To be sure, something worthwhile can be made of ... Surin's
proposal to foster frank and open exchanges among ASEAN countries
as one of the ways to tackle the region's myriad problems. But
there are already avenues for doing this.
	    &UR; ___
	   Sueddeutsche Zeitung, Munich, on rebellion against Kabila:
	   No peace for Congo: a rebellion is now underway against ex-rebel
Kabila. The Tutsi-Banyamulenge _ precisely the minority that
initiated Kabila's successful coup against dictator Mobutu two
years ago _ have threatened his tenuous hold on the vast nation.
The rebellion does not spell the end of Kabila, but it does signify
the beginning of conflict over new power structures within the
region of vast lakes between the Congo and its eastern neighbors.
	   Lacking his own army, Kabila used the Banyamulenge (or Congolese
Tutsis) ... for his military victory. But since then the Tutsi -
traditionally maligned in the Congo - have become a nuisance to
him. Feeling strong enough to get rid of them for good, Kabila
ordered them to leave one week ago. Yet he failed to keep his word
toward both the Tutsi minority in the Congo and their Tutsi
``godfathers'' in Rwandaclarations of
non-involvement one thing remains certain: As long as the Tutsi
regard their ``Lebensraum'' as threatened, there will be no peace.
Kigali will not sit by idly, should the Tutsi in eastern Congo be
threatened. Then the signals will point rapidly toward all-out war,
a war that will be waged over the separation of the Kivu from the
Congo.
	    &UR; ___
	   The Ironton Tribune, Ironton, Ohio, on President Bill Clinton
and Monica Lewinsky:
	   Now that Monica Lewinsky has agreed to testify to the fact that
she and President Bill Clinton had a sexual relationship, Clinton
supporters are scurrying to find a positive slant to yet another
disturbing story from the White House.
	   President Clinton's alleged dalliance with Miss Lewinsky is not
just a sex case. It is an indictment of an attitude.
	   Sex between consenting adults is fine. The problem is, adultery
is not. The Clinton case is disturbing because Americans are
starting to realize that all the soothsayers who have predicted
that the days of honor and morality are evaporating are right.
	   But soon, we will look for heroes again. We will hunger for the
good guys again, not those who are the most skillful at
manipulating themselves out of trouble.
	   That is the poll that will count.

Civilian wounded in Israeli shelling, rockets land near border

 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with more guerrilla attacks in grafs 5-7

<TEXT>
	   NABATIYEH, Lebanon (AP) _ Guerrillas fired rockets near the
Lebanese-Israeli border Thursday, and Israeli forces shelled
southern Lebanon. A 110-year-old Lebanese man was wounded.
	   Israeli forces shelled suspected guerrilla hideouts after
Hezbollah fighters attacked an Israeli-occupied border enclave with
rockets and mortars Wednesday night, security officials said.
	   Abdel Hassan Boushar was cut slightly in the face by broken
glass after an Israeli shell crashed near his house in Kfar Tibnit,
a village just outside the occupied zone, said the officials,
speaking on customary condition of anonymity.
	   Earlier Thursday, guerrillas of the Iranian-backed Hezbollah
group fired about 12 Katyusha rockets and mortar shells at three
Israeli-held outposts near Lebanon's border with Israel, a
Hezbollah official said. No casualties were reported.
	   Guerrillas also fired mortar shells at an Israeli military
outpost at Mashaaroun, one mile from the Israeli border.
	   Israel's Channel Two television reported that several shells
fell inside Israel, damaging a bus carrying soldiers and a tank.
	   There was no immediate confirmation of the television report
from Lebanese security officials or the Israeli army.
	   Hezbollah is leading a guerrilla war to try to oust some 1,500
Israeli soldiers and the 2,500 members of the Israeli-allied South
Lebanon Army militia from the occupied zone.
	   Israel set up the zone in 1985 to protect its northern towns
from guerrilla attacks across the border.

Fighting lessens in two Kosovo areas
</HEADLINE>

that intensity of fighting has dropped, report of international
doctors' group, families of missing Serbs seeking outside help for
their release; contains new information throughout; EDITS. &QL;

<TEXT>
	   PRISTINA, Yugoslavia (AP) _ While fighting decreased Thursday in
two areas of Kosovo, international relief workers worried about how
to care for some 200,000 Kosovo refugees.
	   ``The situation in Kosovo has deteriorated significantly and can
now only be described as a humanitarian disaster,'' said a
statement from Carol Bellamy, executive director of the U.N.
Children's Fund (UNICEF).
	   ``The principal victims of the escalating violence are children
and women. Some 200,000 people have been displaced facing daily
terror, the loss of their homes, severe malnutrition and a range of
health crises,'' the statement said. ``If concerted and effective
international initiative is not taken soon, world leaders risk
seeing the situation in Kosovo escalate to grotesque levels of
violence and brutality.''
	   The refugees have been displaced by the current offensive
launched by Serbian forces seeking to push back and defeat the
underground Kosovo Liberation Army fighting for the independence
for Kosovo.
	   Kosovo is a province in southern Serbia where ethnic Albanians
represent 90 percent of the population. Serbia and the smaller
republic of Montenegro make up what is left of Yugoslavia.
	   Earlier in the day, Serb sources said there was fierce fighting
along the main Pristina-Prizren road near the village of Crnoljevo,
southwest of Kosovo's capital, and clashes continued near the
besieged village Junik, close to the Albanian border.
	   But reporters traveling in the countryside Thursday got the
impression that the Serbian campaign was gradually winding down.
Their observations appeared to be confirmed by a report of the
ethnic Albanian Kosovo Information Center.
	   It said fighting continued in the border area around Junik and
near Djakovica, but with much less intensity than on previous days.
	   International aid agencies continued efforts to care for the
tens of thousands of refugees scattered throughout the province.
	   Thousands were hiding in the hills around Negrovce, a village 25
kilometers (15 miles) west of Pristina, in ``extremely difficult
conditions,'' with no shelter and daytime temperatures up to 38
degrees Celsius (100 F), a statement by the Doctors Without Borders
group issued in Geneva said.
	   It said two mobile teams were traveling through Kosovo daily in
search of safe places where clinics can be set up with local
doctors' help and with a capacity for 350 consultations daily.
	   Patients are suffering above all from diarrhea, respiratory and
skin infections, as well as stress-related problems, the statement
said, adding the teams are struggling with access problems.
	   Meanwhile, family members of more than 100 Serbs presumed
kidnapped by ethnic Albanians in Kosovo met Thursday with U.S. and
Red Cross officials, demanding help to get their relatives released
or at least accounted for.
	   Beatrix Weber, of the International Committee of the Red Cross
office in Pristina, said the organization was actively working on
cases of 40 missing Serbs, presumed abducted by separatist rebels,
out of a registered total of 138.
	   Weber said that ICRC lists of missing since fighting escalated
earlier this year include 400 Kosovo Albanians, but she advised
``utmost caution'' regarding the number as it was still being
checked.
	   Also Thursday, the European Union approved 5 million European
currency units (dlrs 5.5 million) in aid for Kosovo. The EU
Commission said the funds will enable the United Nations and
humanitarian groups to take urgent steps to help people fleeing the
fighting.

Brittin sets new run scoring record in women's test cricket
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   GUILDFORD, England (AP) _ England's Jan Britten earned a women's
test cricket run-scoring record Thursday with a century against
Australia in the women's Ashes match at Guildford.
	   The 39-year-old opener became the highest run scorer in womens
test cricket, surpassing the 1,594-run record set by England's
Rachael Heyhoe-Flint in 1979.
	   She resumed the day at 104, six runs short of the record, and
continued to bat until she was run out for 146.
	   Britten guided England to a 414 first innings total.
	   In reply, Australia was 99 for one at stumps.

Zanardi going for third straight
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By TIM PUET &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   LEXINGTON, Ohio (AP) _ Tony Kanaan has the results of Sunday's
Miller Lite 200 figured out.
	   ``I had a good dream about this race,'' the leading rookie in
the CART FedEx Indy-car Championship Series said. ``I started
fourth and was fighting with Alex (Zanardi) for the lead. You know
how dreams are. It got crazy for a while.
	   ``But in the end, Alex was first, Bobby (Rahal) was second and I
was standing on the podium in third place.''
	   Those three drivers probably would be pleased to see the race at
the Mid-Ohio Sports Car Course turn out that way.
	   A victory for Zanardi would be his third in a row at the
3.62-kilometer (2.25-mile), 13-turn road course.
	   A second-place finish for Rahal, who is retiring at season's
end, would be his best this season and a memorable ending to his
racing career at his home track.
	   And a podium finish for Kanaan would be the first this year for
Tasman Motorsports, which like Rahal's team is based in the
Columbus suburb of Hilliard.
	   Kanaan's dream didn't include anything about who would win the
pole position during Friday's and Saturday's qualifying. That's of
major interest because the next driver to win both a pole and the
following race is in line for big money _ dlrs 410,000 if it
happens at Mid-Ohio.
	   The race winner receives dlrs 100,000 and the pole winner gets
dlrs 10,000, and an additional dlrs 15,000 should he win the race.
The dlrs 15,000 bonus rolls over until a victory from the pole is
recorded.
	   The last driver to win a CART race from the pole was Zanardi at
Cleveland in July 1997. This will be the 20th race since then, so
if the polesitter wins Sunday, he will get dlrs 125,000 just for a
weekend's work plus the dlrs 285,000 accumulated from the previous
19 races. The previous record pole purse for the series was dlrs
160,000 won by Al Unser Jr. in 1994.
	   Mid-Ohio has been good to pole winners in the past, with eight
of the previous 16 CART races here being won by the driver who
qualified first.
	   Canada's Greg Moore, who won the U.S. 500 two weeks ago at
Michigan, said that despite the money, he's not aiming for the pole
any more than he would be at other times.
	   ``It's nice to qualify up front, but on the other hand, I don't
know if you want to qualify on the pole, given what's happened
lately. Maybe it would be better to finish second,'' said Moore,
who won on the last lap at Michigan in a race with a record 62 lead
changes.
	   That mark won't be endangered at Mid-Ohio, a track with tight
turns and few spots for passing. The winner generally comes from
among the first four qualifiers and no one has won from farther
back than eighth.
	   Zanardi has history working for and against him this weekend. He
has won consecutive races at Mid-Ohio, but no CART driver has ever
won three in a row here.
	   A victory for him would break a pattern in which the same driver
has won twice in a row every year since 1990 _ Michael Andretti in
1990 and 1991, Emerson Fittipaldi in 1992 and 1993, Unser in 1994
and 1995 and Zanardi the past two years.
	   ``This is probably my favorite race course because it's the most
challenging from a driver's point of view on a single lap,''
Zanardi said.
	   His lead of 68 points in the driver standings means he can go
pointless in the next three races and remain in first place.
	   Rahal, the winner here in 1985 and 1986, will be the sentimental
favorite. He announced earlier this year that he's retiring after a
17-year career.
	   ``There are many great memories and I'm sure this weekend's race
will be emotional for me, especially considering I saw the first
race ever-run at Mid-Ohio'' in 1963, when he was 9, Rahal said.
``I'm not sure I'll get misty, but I'm not making any guarantees.''
	   The race will cover 83 laps and 301.5 kilometers (187.4 miles).

<TEXT>
	   PARIS (AP) _ Health authorities on Thursday said that 20 people
have contracted Legionnaires' disease in the Paris region since
June and four of the victims have died. But investigators are so
far unable to locate a source of the bacteria striking tourists and
natives alike.
	   At least nine European tourists -- seven British and two
Scandinavians -- are among those who have been stricken by the
disease since June 6, according to a statement by the National
Public Health Center.
	   Of those who died, one is British and three are French,
according to the General Direction of Health.
	   The latest death, announced Thursday evening, was the first new
case of the disease since July 3. The victim, French, died on July
31, said a statement.
	   Half of the 20 cases were contracted June 15-21.

	   The Daily Tidings, Ashland, Oregon, on space-based U.S. missile
defense:
	   Here we go again.
	   Some military and congressional leaders now are talking about a
space-based U.S. missile defense system to keep Americans safe from
intercontinental missile attacks. It's Son of Star Wars, and it's
one more federal boondoggle.
	   We find the new Star Wars discussion both dangerous and
counterproductive. ...
	   It also would cost billions and billions of dollars that could
better be spent elsewhere in this country: on health care reforms,
welfare reform, environmental cleanup, highway repairs, child care,
police and jails, drug abuse and prevention ... the list is nearly
endless.
	   We also find it more than ironic that the United States, the
world leader in weapons production and overseas export, must again
worry itself about the ``Return to Sender'' possibilities of some
of those weapons, their components or their technology, coming home
to roost.
	   Star Wars was a flop. Son of Star Wars should be relegated to
the dustbin, post-haste.

	   San Antonio Express-News, San Antonio, on presidential trade
authority:
	   House Republicans are planning to push for a September vote to
return fast-track trade negotiating authority to the president.
	   President Clinton backed away from plans to push for a vote on
fast-track last fall after facing stiff opposition from his fellow
Democrats.
	   Democrats charge that the GOP leadership is pushing the issue to
divide them during the election season. That's a hollow objection.
	   Fast-track authority is needed for the United States to keep
pace in world trade. It would allow the White House to negotiate
trade pacts with other nations that could not be amended by
Congress, which would vote ``yea'' or ``nay'' on the language as
written.
	   If Democrats are going to block fast-track, they should be
forced into a recorded vote so the public can clearly see which
House members are responsible for blocking progress.
	   Clinton should get on board and push for a vote.
	   It's hard to accept the notion that he will have more clout
after the 1998 elections. The administration may be hobbled next
year by the scandals engulfing the president. And as a lame duck,
his influence naturally will continue to decline in the final two
years of his term.
	    &UR; ___
	   The Times-Picayune, New Orleans, Louisiana, on Sanctions:
	   Both Congress and the Clinton administration are re-evaluating
with increasing seriousness what has become virtually a knee-jerk
reaction to foreign policy problems: unilateral economic sanctions.
Given the economic power of the United States, sanctioning nations
that violate U.S. standards or interests would seem a powerful
policy tool. But the record is that they fail to achieve their
goals and often do more harm to us than to their targets. ...
	   The Senate and State Department have formed special review
panels to review sanctions, and bills in the Senate and House would
require cost-benefit analyses of proposed sanctions and ``sunset''
them in two years unless renewed. The purpose is not to abandon
sanctions but to get smarter in their use. ...
	   The most effective sanctions are universal and virtually
inescapable, but even they are long-term efforts. Unilateral
sanctions as quick fixes or political grandstanding are a form of
shooting from the hip (and often at the foot) that a great power
loses status by indulging in.

Scientists develop better morning-after contraceptive pill
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: EMBARGOED by source until 0001 GMT, Friday August 7. &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   GENEVA (AP) _ Scientists say trials of a new morning-after pill
show a lower failure rate and fewer side effects than existing
emergency contraception, the World Health Organization said Friday.
	   In a study published in this week's edition of British medical
journal The Lancet, researchers say large-scale trials of
levonorgestrel confirmed it outperforms the most commonly used
contraceptive pill, known in medical circles as the Yuzpe regimen.
	   Levonorgestrel, a type of hormone, is part of the Yuzpe regimen.
But research has shown that the hormone might be more effective
when used on its own, the study said.
	   To prove this on a large scale, a team of scientists working
under the auspices of a WHO research program conducted a study
involving 1,998 women with an average age of 27 in 21 centers
worldwide.
	   ``This study has clearly demonstrated that levonorgestrel
outperforms the Yuzpe method,'' said Helena von Hertzen, the WHO
program's medical officer.
	   ``We believe these findings will persuade health services
already offering emergency contraception to start offering
levonorgestrel instead of or in addition to the Yuzpe method.''
	   In their study, the researchers found the percentage of women
who became pregnant despite taking the treatment was higher in the
group under the Yuzpe regimen than it was among those who received
levonorgestrel.
	   Calculations made by the researchers of the number of
pregnancies expected if no treatment had been given demonstrated
that levonorgestrel prevented 85 percent, compared to 57 percent
with the Yuzpe regimen.
	   In both groups, the earlier the treatment was started, the lower
the pregnancy rate, the researchers said.
	   Among women who started treatment within 24 hours of having
unprotected sex, levonorgestrel prevented 95 percent of potential
pregnancies, compared with 77 percent for the Yuzpe method.
	   Levonorgestrel was also more effective when applied up to 48
hours and later. Researchers found it was much better tolerated by
women than the Yuzpe regimen.
	   Women subjected to both methods reported the same side effects,
including nausea, vomiting, dizziness, fatigue, headache, breast
tenderness and lower abdominal pain.
	   But those women who took levonorgestrel reported experiencing
each of these side effects far less frequently than those under the
Yuzpe regimen, researchers said.
	   Paul Van Look, director of the WHO program, said a variation of
the levonorgestrel pill has already been marketed in Hungary.
Applications for registration have been granted in Kenya and Sri
Lanka.
	   But the product hasn't yet been registered elsewhere, he said.

	   MASERU, Lesotho (AP) _ Riot police deployed at Parliament
Thursday as crowds of opposition protesters gathered outside the
gate, preventing the legislature from meeting for a second day.
	   Protesters alleged the May election, in which the Lesotho
Congress for Democracy returned to office, was rigged.
	   The angry mob brandished sticks and shouted anti-government
slogans. They demanded that King Letsie address them, but the
palace refused.
	   Several hundred demonstrators then settled down for the night,
lighting fires and wrapping themselves in blankets.
	   A landlocked, impoverished nation of 2 million with a history of
political upheaval, Lesotho is a predominantly Christian country
entirely surrounded by South Africa. It is dependent on
cattle-raising and diamond exports.

Netanyahu calls on Arafat to condemn attack
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By DINA KRAFT &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu called on
Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat Thursday to condemn a grisly
double killing of two Jewish settlers.
	   ``Arafat should condemn and oppose such crimes,'' Netanyahu
said.
	   Arafat's aides said the Palestinian leader would be prepared to
condemn the West Bank attack in the framework of an interview put
was not planning any public statement on the killings.
	   With tensions between the sides running high one day after the
killings, Israeli and Palestinian negotiators did not resume talks
aimed at solving a long overdue Israeli troop withdrawal from the
West Bank.
	   Netanyahu however said he wanted discussions to continue with
negotiators placing a stronger emphasis on Israel's security
concerns.
	   Negotiators held their last round of direct talks over an
Israeli troop withdrawal one day before the attack and the talks
have not resumed.
	   The sides have been haggling over the scope of a withdrawal as
laid out in a U.S. peace proposal, with little progress. The
Palestinians accepted the plan but Israel has not, saying a 13
percent withdrawal would harm its security.
	   Both sides have asked several times for further American
intervention to reach a deal on the withdrawal.
	   Thursday, negotiators took their cases to Jordanian Crown Prince
Hassan in Amman, Jordan.
	   Chief Palestinian negotiator Saeb Erekat said he visited Hassan
to ask for Jordan's help in convincing the United States to
pressure Israel to accept its initiative.
	   ``We have traveled all the roads we possibly could with the
Israeli side through the series of meetings,'' Erekat said, ``But
the Israelis presented ideas that in no way comply with the signed
agreements or the American initiative,'' Erekat said.
	   However, Israeli Public Security Minister Avigdor Kahalani
delivered a message to the prince that Israel and the Palestinians
were close to resolving problems holding up the troop withdrawal
from the West Bank.
	   Settler leaders say Netanyahu's latest pullback offer _ rejected
Tuesday by Arafat as giving the Palestinians too little land _
instead concedes too much territory, leaving settlements vulnerable
to attack.
	   Netanyahu met with settler leaders Thursday to talk about areas
Israel may pullback from.
	   During a visit to the families of the two young men slain at
Wednesday, President Ezer Weizman said efforts to reach peace must
continue despite the attack.
	   ``I think the peace process is an important historic step. There
is a large controversy and of course this tragedy has not helped.
But we must show great strength and courage to continue with it
(the peace process),'' Weizman told reporters.
	   Two of the five Palestinian villages near Itzhar remained under
curfew Thursday as Israeli soldiers searched for suspects. Police
spokesman Ofir Sivan said no arrests have been made.

	   ATHENS, Greece (AP) _ Officials declared a state of emergency in
the greater Athens area and in a southern prefecture Thursday as
wind-whipped fires killed at least one person and threatened the
ancient site of the Olympic games.
	   Firefighting aircraft and personnel arrived from Italy and
France to help battle blazes that engulfed homes around Greece and
stretched the country's firefighting forces to the limit.
	   France sent three firefighting planes and fire crews. Italy
dispatched two planes, while a French aircraft to coordinate
efforts also arrived.
	   By evening, fires had abated in the southern Greek prefecture of
Ilia in the Peloponnese. A state of emergency had been declared
there after the fires got within a kilometer (1/2 mile) of the more
than 2,000-year-old monuments of Ancient Olympia, about 185
kilometers (110 miles) southwest of Athens.
	   ``It is an ecological disaster that this area has not seen in
100 years,'' said Metropolitan Germanos, the local bishop.
	   At nightfall, nearly all fires had been extinguished in an area
around Mount Pendeli near Athens by nightfall. Earlier a
67-year-old doctor, Constatinos Mihailidis, died in the area when
his car caught on fire as he tried to flee the flames.
	   More than a dozen homes, restaurants and businesses were
destroyed in Pendeli, where firefighters struggled against winds of
up to 88 kilometers per hour (54 mph).
	   More than 1,500 soldiers and firefighters battled the Pendeli
blaze, which raged through one of the last tracts of woodland in
Athens.
	   Several hospitals and a residential home for the elderly were
evacuated. Power lines were also damaged, leading to frequent power
outages throughout the capital.
	   A state of emergency was called for all of Attica, the province
that includes Athens and the main port, Piraeus. More than half of
Greece's 11 million people live in Attica.
	   Officials openly speculated that arsonists may be responsible
for some of the blazes.
	   ``We are sure that here some hand started the fires,'' said
Public Order Minister Giorgos Romaios.
	   Justice Minister Evanghelos Yannopoulos, who said no legal mercy
would be shown to arsonists, was more open and reflected popular
feelings that the dozens of fires that have plagued Athens and the
rest of the country were intentional.
	   ``According to the whole hearted voice of public opinion, they
did not occur by chance, they are intentional arson. They are set
by organized groups all over the country ... from enemies of the
country, by secret services,'' Yannopoulos said. He did not
elaborate.
	   Forest and brush fires are common during Greece's hot and dry
summers. But this season has been declared one of the worst in
decades.
	   In July alone, more than 3,000 wildfires were reported compared
with 2,800 for the entire summer season last year, the government
said.
	   Last month, four firefighters perished during a forest fire on
the eastern edge of Athens.

	   NABATIYEH, Lebanon (AP) _ Guerrillas fired rockets near the
Lebanese-Israeli border Thursday, and Israeli forces shelled
southern Lebanon. A 110-year-old Lebanese man was wounded.
	   Israeli forces shelled suspected guerrilla hideouts after
Hezbollah fighters attacked an Israeli-occupied border enclave with
rockets and mortars Wednesday night, security officials said.
	   Abdel Hassan Boushar was cut slightly in the face by broken
glass after an Israeli shell crashed near his house in Kfar Tibnit,
a village just outside the occupied zone, said the officials,
speaking on customary condition of anonymity.
	   Earlier Thursday, guerrillas of the Iranian-backed Hezbollah
group fired about 12 Katyusha rockets and mortar shells at three
Israeli-held outposts near Lebanon's border with Israel, a
Hezbollah official said. No casualties were reported.
	   Guerrillas also fired mortar shells at an Israeli military
outpost at Mashaaroun, one mile from the Israeli border.
	   In Jerusalem, an Israeli army spokesman denied an Israeli
television report that several shells fell inside Israel.
	   The spokesman said the mortar shells landed in Lebanon and did
not inflict injury.
	   Hezbollah is leading a guerrilla war to try to oust some 1,500
Israeli soldiers and the 2,500 members of the Israeli-allied South
Lebanon Army militia from the occupied zone.
	   Israel set up the zone in 1985 to protect its northern towns
from guerrilla attacks across the border.

<TEXT>
	   TEL AVIV, Israel (AP) _ Israel's Holocaust memorial lodged an
official protest Thursday with the Polish government demanding the
removal of crosses erected at the Auschwitz death camp which upset
the memory of 1.5 million Jews killed there.
	   The complaint follows several pleas by the Israeli government
and Holocaust survivor groups for the removal of dozens of newly
erected crosses at the site.
	   Yisrael Cohen, spokesman for the Yad Vashem memorial said the
Polish government was violating an international agreement it had
signed aimed at protecting the memory of those killed by the Nazis.
	   On Thursday, the Polish government issued a statement in Warsaw
saying it was up to the Roman Catholic Church, and not the
government to deal with the crosses which were on private property
near the death camp.
	   In an effort to resolve the conflict, Yad Vashem, the U.S.
Holocaust Museum in Washington and Polish government and church
authorities, signed a deal earlier this year forbidding the
presence of ``religious, ideological or political symbols,'' at the
death camp.
	   More than 50 crosses have been erected over the last two weeks
near a larger cross placed at the site after a 1979 papal mass
there.
	   Cardinal Jozef Glemp, head of the Catholic Church in Poland,
defended the crosses and said people erected the newer crosses
``because of the constant nagging by the Jewish side for a swift
removal of the cross.''
	   Jewish groups around the world have long protested the presence
of the cross so close to the Nazi death camp, saying it harms the
memory of Jews murdered there.
	   Yad Vashem director Avner Shalev sent a letter to Poland's
president, prime minister and parliament Thursday demanding ``swift
removal of the crosses.''
	   ``We plan to continue pressuring the Polish government into
meeting its commitment and the immediate removal of the crosses,''
Cohen said. Shalev's complain was delivered to Poland's ambassador
in Tel Aviv Thursday, Cohen said.

Garrido, Paul Lawrie among leaders as players struggle on German
</HEADLINE>
Open's tough course &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   BAD SAAROW, Germany _ Spain's Ignacio Garrido, the defending
champion, broke out of a slump Thursday by firing a 5-under 67 to
grab a share the first round lead at the German Open.
	   Garrido topped the leaderboard at the dlrs dlrs 1.15 million
tournament, along with Scotland's Paul Lawrie, New Zealand's
Michael Campbell and Frenchman Olivier Edmond.
	   Despite sunny skies and a slight breeze, most players struggled
on the challenging course designed by Nick Faldo with its
undulating fairways and deep bunkers.
	   Only 52 of 156 players broke par, with both Lawrie and Campbell
being hit with double bogeys.
	   ``I've had lower rounds this year, but this has to be my best,
considering how tough the course is,'' said Lawrie.
	   The double bogey by Campbell, who finished third at the 1995
British Open, cost him a two-stroke lead heading into the 18th
hole. His drive sailed left into the bunker.
	   England's Russell Claydon was one stroke back at 68, followed at
69 by a trio of Englishmen, Andrew Beal, Steve Webster and Andrew
Sandywell.
	   Garrido strung out five birdies, two bogies and eagled the par-5
344 meter (376 yard) 12th hole as he showed signs of snapping the
slump that had led to him missing eight cuts this year.
	   Garrido had finished sixth in the Volvo rankings last year,
winning his only career tour victory when the tournament was played
at Stuttgart.
	   ``You go up and down so easily in this game and I had a bad
patch,'' said Garrido, who blamed his problems on putting.
	   ``Last year I'd finish 15th and think what a bad week. This
year, finishing 30th, I would think that was good.''
	   During his round, the Spaniard sank an 18-foot putt for a birdie
followed by one of 25 feet for his eagle.
	   Germany's Bernhard Langer, a five-time winner of the event,
struggled with stomach cramps and fired a 74. At one point, he
threw his club in frustration.
	   ``I haven't won a tournament this year,'' said the two-time
Masters champion, ``but I'm still highly motivated.''

Italy sends Pakistanis home; Aid for Tunisia
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; EDS: UPDATES with more details of Italy-Tunisia accord, comments by
ministers; comments on Craxi; EDITS to TRIM &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   ROME (AP) _ Italy sent 143 Pakistanis home Thursday in the first
mass repatriation since thousands of would-be immigrants began
reaching Italian shores this summer and worked out a deal with
Tunisia to try to discourage the exodus.
	   Many who have landed in Italy came from that North African
country, which had balked at taking back the illegal immigrants who
have been detained in crowded, improvised shelters.
	   Italy signed similar agreements with about a dozen nations,
including Morocco last month.
	   Italian news reports said that Rome promised Tunis about dlrs 86
million in development aid through 2000 for job creation so that
Tunisians would be less likely to try to enter Italy illegally in
hopes of finding work here or elsewhere in Europe.
	   In return, Tunisia pledged to speed up identification of the
arrivals so they could be sent back home, said Tunisian Foreign
Minister Said Ben Mousthafa.
	   The two countries also pledged better cooperation between their
naval fleets which patrol the Mediterranean ``to avoid a repetition
of incidents like the numerous ones of the last few years and the
last few months,'' said Italy's foreign minister, Lamberto Dini.
	   In addition to the illegal immigrant issues, aggravating
tensions between Rome and Tunis has been the seizure of many
Italian fishing boats.
	   Since last fall, when Germany and other European allies
complained that too many illegals were reaching them via Italy's
largely unpatrolled coasts, Rome has cracked down. Instead of just
handing illegal immigrants expulsion papers giving them 15 days to
leave, authorities now confine them to shelters while they await
repatriation by ship or plane.
	   The Pakistanis were put on a special Alitalia flight to
Islamabad.
	   As part of the negotiations, Italy also asked Tunisia to
strengthen controls along its coastline to help stem the flow of
immigrants who arrive daily. Most make the journey on overcrowded
vessels and land on the tiny island of Lampedusa, which is closer
to Africa than Sicily, or on shores along Italy's south.
	   More than 3,000 immigrants, mostly from Tunisia, Morocco and
other poor African nations, reached Italy in July alone. The flow
of immigrants traveling to Italy usually picks up considerably in
the summer months when the weather is warmer and seas calmer.
	   Another thorny issue with Tunisia has been that country's
hospitality toward former Socialist Prime Minister Bettino Craxi,
who has been convicted or investigated for corruption in Italy and
is living in self-imposed exile in his Tunisian seaside villa.
	   Mousthafa said possible extradition of Craxi wasn't discussed.

	   BOGOTA, Colombia (AP) _ Colombians hopeful that a new president
might attain peace were instead inundated by images of body bags
being loaded onto helicopters, soldiers on stretchers and grieving
relatives Thursday.
	   The success of the massive three-day rebel assault, just days
before Andres Pastrana's swearing in Friday as president, shows
just how strong the leftist insurgents have become and how
difficult it will be to make peace.
	   In fighting that tapered off Wednesday, guerrillas from the two
largest rebel factions set off bombs in cities and towns, attacked
oil pipelines and a hydroelectric dam and hammered army and police
bases in about half the country with rockets, mortars and grenades.
	   The government said 68 soldiers and police were killed and 87
wounded by rebels of the 15,000-member Revolutionary Armed Forces
of Colombia, or FARC, and the 5,000-member National Liberation
Army, or ELN. Another 46 security force members were missing in
action, it said.
	   In the most devastating action, rebels overran an important
anti-narcotics base in Miraflores, killing or dragging away dozens
of soldiers and police as possible bargaining chips.
	   The rebel commander who organized the raid, Jorge Briceno, told
reporters by radio that guerrillas took more than 100 prisoners.
	   The rebel onslaught was a rude welcome for Pastrana, who met in
the jungles of Colombia last month with top FARC leaders and agreed
to start peace talks with the 36-year-old rebel group by November.
	   ``Sometimes you have to work for peace in the midst of war,'' an
undeterred Pastrana told reporters Wednesday.
	   Grim-faced army leaders said they repelled the offensive and
called it a military and political failure for the rebels.
Colombian military analysts disagreed.
	   ``It's the largest disaster in the history of the insurgency,
and it comes on top of an entire chain of disasters over the past
three years, '' said Alfredo Rangel, a former presidential national
security advisor.
	   The rebels killed 62 soldiers and seized 43 others in a March
attack blamed by army leaders on intelligence failures of the same
sort that apparently failed to anticipate this week's guerrilla
actions.
	   The 120,000-member army has been unable to counter an
increasingly bolder and well-trained rebel force that has gained in
wealth and firepower in part by stepped up revenues from ransom
kidnappings and ``war taxes' on cocaine production in
rebel-controlled areas.
	   The guerrillas have gone from occasional ambushes of small
groups of soldiers and simple harassment to assaults by hundreds of
rebels on heavily fortified army and police bases, such as the
southern Miraflores base overrun on Monday.
	   The challenge for Pastrana, observers say, will be to reform and
strengthen an ineffective and demoralized military so he carries
some measure of clout while trying to negotiate peace with an
adversary on an unprecedented winning streak.
	   ``The guerrillas at this moment have many more cards to
negotiate with,'' said Rangel. ``They have much more bargaining
power for having carried out this demonstration of force.''

	   KINSHASA, Congo (AP) _ Eerily reminiscent of Congo President
Laurent Kabila's rebel march to power last year, Tutsi rebels and
Rwandan soldiers were reportedly advancing Thursday across this
vast, divided African nation.
	   Embattled by the widening conflict, Kabila's government
threatened to wage war against neighboring Rwanda, which it accused
of masterminding the uprising.
	   Government spokesman Didier Mumenge warned that Congo would
``extend the war into Rwanda'' unless the international community
pressured the tiny country to withdraw Rwandan troops allegedly
deployed in Congo.
	   Congo's Justice Minister Mwenze Kongolo also pledged in a CNN
International broadcast to retaliate against Kabila's one-time
ally.
	   ``We are moving back to Rwanda,'' Kongolo said. ``This war
started in Rwanda and it is going to end in Rwanda.''
	   The latest offensive is believed to be led by many of the same
Tutsi fighters _ known as Banyamulenge _ and Rwandan military men
who played a key role in the eight-month trek by Kabila's forces
from east to west arriving in the capital of Kinshasa last May.
	   That earlier march ended with the ouster of longtime Zairian
dictator Mobutu Sese Seko.
	   As before, the latest renegades have quickly captured Congo's
eastern cities near Rwanda's borders, while moving west through the
jungle interior.
	   Rwanda has repeatedly denied involvement in the newest conflict
although witnesses and aid workers have seen the Rwandan troops.
	   Key rebel gains in eastern Congo included the cities of Bukavu
and Goma near the border with Rwanda, which were reportedly seized
Wednesday. Fighting continued Thursday in the city of Kisangani
further into the interior, according to aid workers and rebel
sources.
	   A government official, however, said Kisangani was firmly in
loyalists' hands.

	   PRISTINA, Yugoslavia (AP) _ While fighting persisted Thursday in
two areas of Kosovo at a lower level than before, international
relief workers worried about how to care for some 200,000 Kosovo
refugees.
	   ``The situation in Kosovo has deteriorated significantly and can
now only be described as a humanitarian disaster,'' said a
statement from Carol Bellamy, executive director of the U.N.
Children's Fund (UNICEF).
	   ``The principal victims of the escalating violence are children
and women. Some 200,000 people have been displaced facing daily
terror, the loss of their homes, severe malnutrition and a range of
health crises,'' the statement said.
	   ``If concerted and effective international initiative is not
taken soon, world leaders risk seeing the situation in Kosovo
escalate to grotesque levels of violence and brutality,'' it added.
	   The refugees have been displaced by the current offensive
launched by Serbian forces seeking to push back and defeat the
underground Kosovo Liberation Army fighting for the independence
for Kosovo.
	   Kosovo is a province in southern Serbia where ethnic Albanians
represent 90 percent of the population. Serbia and the smaller
republic of Montenegro make up what is left of Yugoslavia.
	   Hundreds have been killed since Serbian forces cracked down on
the guerillas in March, and particularly in their latest offensive.
Kosovo's unofficial President Ibrahim Rugova declared Friday a day
of mourning.
	   Earlier in the day, Serb sources said there was fierce fighting
along the main Pristina-Prizren road near the village of Crnoljevo,
southwest of Kosovo's capital, and clashes continued near the
besieged village Junik, close the Albanian border.
	   But reporters traveling in the countryside Thursday got the
impression that the Serbian campaign was gradually winding down.
Their observations appeared to be confirmed by a report of the
ethnic Albanian Kosovo Information Center.
	   It said fighting continued in the border area around Junik and
near Djakovica, but with much less intensity than on previous days.
	   An ethnic Albanian arrested by police after the fighting in the
central town of Orahovac died in custody Thursday, the center
claimed. It also said KLA fighters held their own in western Kosovo
between the twons of Decani, Klina and Djakovica.
	   It claimed Serbian forces killed four KLA fighters, while the
Serbs lost 17 men. The report could not be verified.
	   In Belgrade, Vojislav Seselj, an ultranationalist and currently
a Serbian vice premier, called for a thorough strike against the
Kla, saying ``no village must remain under their control ... There
must be no yielding to pressures from Western powers who would
dismember the territory of Serbia.''

	   BOGOTA, Colombia (AP) _ Colombians hopeful that a new president
might attain peace were instead inundated by images of body bags
being loaded onto helicopters, soldiers on stretchers and grieving
relatives Thursday.
	   The success of the massive three-day rebel assault, just days
before Andres Pastrana's swearing in Friday as president, shows
just how strong the leftist insurgents have become and how
difficult it will be to make peace.
	   In fighting that tapered off Wednesday, guerrillas from the two
largest rebel factions set off bombs in cities and towns, attacked
oil pipelines and a hydroelectric dam and hammered army and police
bases in about half the country with rockets, mortars and grenades.
	   The government said 68 soldiers and police were killed and 87
wounded by rebels of the 15,000-member Revolutionary Armed Forces
of Colombia, or FARC, and the 5,000-member National Liberation
Army, or ELN. Another 46 security force members were missing in
action, it said.
	   In the most devastating action, rebels overran an important
anti-narcotics base in Miraflores, killing or dragging away dozens
of soldiers and police as possible bargaining chips.
	   The rebel commander who organized the raid, Jorge Briceno, told
reporters by radio that guerrillas took more than 100 prisoners.
	   The rebel onslaught was a rude welcome for Pastrana, who met in
the jungles of Colombia last month with top FARC leaders and agreed
to start peace talks with the 34-year-old rebel group by November.

Italy sends Pakistanis home; Aid for Tunisia
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; EDS: SUBS last graf, Mousthafa said, to ADD Dini comments on Craxi
case &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   ROME (AP) _ Italy sent 143 Pakistanis home Thursday in the first
mass repatriation since thousands of would-be immigrants began
reaching Italian shores this summer and worked out a deal with
Tunisia to try to discourage the exodus.
	   Many who have landed in Italy came from that North African
country, which had balked at taking back the illegal immigrants who
have been detained in crowded, improvised shelters.
	   Italy signed similar agreements with about a dozen nations,
including Morocco last month.
	   Italian news reports said that Rome promised Tunis about dlrs 86
million in development aid through 2000 for job creation so that
Tunisians would be less likely to try to enter Italy illegally in
hopes of finding work here or elsewhere in Europe.
	   In return, Tunisia pledged to speed up identification of the
arrivals so they could be sent back home, said Tunisian Foreign
Minister Said Ben Mousthafa.
	   The two countries also pledged better cooperation between their
naval fleets which patrol the Mediterranean ``to avoid a repetition
of incidents like the numerous ones of the last few years and the
last few months,'' said Italy's foreign minister, Lamberto Dini.
	   In addition to the illegal immigrant issues, aggravating
tensions between Rome and Tunis has been the seizure of many
Italian fishing boats.
	   Since last fall, when Germany and other European allies
complained that too many illegals were reaching them via Italy's
largely unpatrolled coasts, Rome has cracked down. Instead of just
handing illegal immigrants expulsion papers giving them 15 days to
leave, authorities now confine them to shelters while they await
repatriation by ship or plane.
	   The Pakistanis were put on a special Alitalia flight to
Islamabad.
	   As part of the negotiations, Italy also asked Tunisia to
strengthen controls along its coastline to help stem the flow of
immigrants who arrive daily. Most make the journey on overcrowded
vessels and land on the tiny island of Lampedusa, which is closer
to Africa than Sicily, or on shores along Italy's south.
	   More than 3,000 immigrants, mostly from Tunisia, Morocco and
other poor African nations, reached Italy in July alone. The flow
of immigrants traveling to Italy usually picks up considerably in
the summer months when the weather is warmer and seas calmer.
	   Another thorny issue with Tunisia has been that country's
hospitality toward former Socialist Prime Minister Bettino Craxi,
who has been convicted or investigated for corruption in Italy and
is living in self-imposed exile in his Tunisian seaside villa.
	   Mousthafa said possible extradition of Craxi wasn't discussed,
but Dini said the Italians asked Tunis for ``a greater commitment''
toward resolving the question of possible extradition.

England collapse after a Butcher century
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with stumps score
 &UR; By IHITHISHAM KAMARDEEN &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   LEEDS, England (AP) _ England collapsed around a brilliant
maiden century by Mark Butcher Thursday as South Africa wrested the
initiative in the decisive fifth test at Headingley.
	   After Butcher had hammered 116 in eight minutes under five and a
half hours, England, comfortably placed on 181 for three, crashed
to 230 all out after Alec Stewart had won the toss.
	   In reply, South Africa was nine without loss in four overs with
openers Gary Kirsten and Gehardus Liebenberg unbeaten with four
runs apiece.
	   On a wicket that has shown signs of playing tricks with the odd
ball keeping low, the home side batsmen perished largely to
ordinary shots against an all seam attack.
	   After rain had interrupted the day either side of the lunch
break, Shaun Pollock and Makhaya Ntini combined to take 5-17 in 34
balls after resuming on 147 for three at tea.
	   Ntini returned his career best figures 4-72 in 21 overs in his
fourth test. It included 3 for 4 _ Graeme Hick, Ian Salisbury and
Darren Gough _ in a 14-ball spell.
	   Earlier, Ntini claimed the prized wicket of former skipper Mike
Atherton for 16 runs before lunch.
	   Butcher, playing in his 13th test, and Mark Ramprakash (16)
consolidated the innings during a 71-run fourth wicket stand, But
once Ramprakash bottom edged a catch to 'keeper Mark Boucher off
Allan Donald, the fragility of the middle order was badly exposed.
	   England lost 6 for 32 in after tea in 59 balls including Andrew
Flintoff to a dubious decision by International Cricket Council's
independent umpire Pakistani Javed Akhtar.
	   It was a repetition of England's second innings collapse at
Lord's in the second test when the home side lost 6 for 11 in 71
balls before losing by 10 wickets.
	   Flintoff was adjudged caught at short leg by Gehardus Liebenberg
off Pollock, three balls after the ginger haired seamer had forced
Butcher to play on. TV replays showed Flintoff's bat didn't touch
the ball.
	   Graeme Hick, who took 36 minutes and 19 balls to score, didn't
last too long and two balls after he had top edged Ntini for his
two runs, the right hander cut a catch to Jonty Rhodes at point.
	   Hick, recalled after a two-year absence to boost the England
middle order in Trent Bridge, has so far managed six and two in his
two visits to the crease.
	   Butcher and Atherton gave England a solid start _ 45 runs in 16
minutes over an hour _ before England lost two cheap wickets to
lose momentum at 110 for three.
	   Donald, who had struggled in his first seven-over spell, removed
Stewart (15) while Pollock removed Nasser Hussain (9) in the first
hour after lunch.
	   Pollock, who has taken a disappointing 10 wicket in three tests
in the series took 3-51 while Donald's 3-44 extended his series
tally to 28 wickets.
	   Butcher's 252-ball innings included 18 balls and improved on his
previous highest _ 87 against Australia at Lord's in 1997.

	   ATHENS, Greece (AP) _ Officials declared a state of emergency in
the greater Athens area and in a southern prefecture Thursday as
wind-whipped fires killed at least one person and threatened the
ancient site of the Olympic games.
	   Firefighting aircraft and personnel arrived from Italy and
France to help battle blazes that engulfed homes around Greece and
stretched the country's firefighting forces to the limit.
	   France sent three firefighting planes and fire crews. Italy
dispatched two planes, while a French aircraft to coordinate
efforts also arrived.
	   By evening, fires had abated in the southern Greek prefecture of
Ilia in the Peloponnese. A state of emergency had been declared
there after the fires got within a kilometer (1/2 mile) of the more
than 2,000-year-old monuments of Ancient Olympia, about 185
kilometers (110 miles) southwest of Athens.
	   At nightfall, nearly all fires had been extinguished in an area
around Mount Pendeli near Athens by nightfall. Earlier a
67-year-old man, Constatinos Mihailidis, died in the area when his
car caught on fire as he tried to flee the flames.

	   The Council decision on Thursday was unanimous.
	   U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan strongly backed his weapons
inspection chief, Richard Butler, who had been under increasing
pressure in recent months from some council members _ notably
Russia and France _ for not giving the Iraqis a clean bill of
health.
	   Butler has done a ``very good job,'' Annan said.
	   ``The decision that (Iraq has) taken is in violation of Security
Council resolutions and the Memorandum of Understanding,'' Annan
said, referring to the agreement he extracted in February, the last
time Iraq cut off the inspectors from doing their jobs. That
agreement averted an attack on Iraq by the United States and
Britain.
	   But Annan counseled that Iraqi anger needed to be assuaged.
	   ``It might be helpful to engage the Iraqis much more closely
than we have hitherto done,'' he said.
	   He said he had spoken with Iraqi Deputy Prime Minister Tariq
Aziz, and added that the Iraqi position is ``not a closed one.''

<TEXT>
	   CALCUTTA, India (AP) _ With doubts growing over India's nuclear
testing, 250,000 people jammed the streets of Calcutta Thursday to
say they don't want Hiroshima's tragedy of 53 years ago repeated in
South Asia.
	   The demonstration was the world's largest marking the day the
first atomic bomb was dropped.
	   In Hiroshima, a crowd of 50,000 people clasped hands in prayer
and observed a moment of silence at 8:15 a.m. _ the exact moment
the bomb wrought devastation on their city on Aug. 6, 1945.
	   The massive Calcutta demonstration against India's decision to
go nuclear was a sign the initial euphoria over last May's nuclear
tests has been tempered by the sobering impact of economic
sanctions and heightened tensions with Pakistan.
	   Celebrities and writers joined a throng of factory workers and
students in a three-mile march in Calcutta. ``We don't want the
bomb! We want peace!'' chanted the crowd as it assembled in a
Calcutta sports stadium.
	   Smaller antinuclear demonstrations were held throughout India to
mark the anniversary.
	   ``Bread, not bombs!'' shouted demonstrators in New Delhi, where
spiraling food prices and electricity shortages have dampened the
early enthusiasm for the bomb.
	   In Pakistan, which followed India into the nuclear age with
tests of its own, only a few hundred people joined protests in the
three largest cities, Islamabad, Lahore and Karachi. The
demonstrations' smaller size reflected most Pakistanis' belief that
a nuclear bomb is their only defense against their more powerful
rival, India.
	   Calcutta was a natural focus for antinuclear sentiment. It is
the capital of West Bengal, a state led for 20 years by communist
governments which often has been out of step with the rest of
India. But rallies like those held Thursday in Bombay and New
Delhi, even by just a few hundred people, would have been
unthinkable in the initial rush of nationalist pride over the tests
last May.
	   ``The people of India and Pakistan must stop this madness which
threatens us with mutual annihilation,'' said a resolution drawn up
by the August 6th Committee, a group of cultural and intellectual
figures.
	   Mubashir Hasan, a former Pakistani finance minister, flew to New
Delhi to join the rally outside the walls of the old city's Red
Fort and said the tests were unnecessary.
	   ``There was no threat to either India or Pakistan, either from
each other or from anyone else,'' Hasan said.
	   The risks were brought into focus last week by the collapse of
efforts to revive India-Pakistan peace talks, and by a weeklong
artillery barrage that killed 120 people on both sides of the
disputed border in Kashmir.
	   Pakistan's ambassador to India, Ashraf Jehangir Qazi, warned the
border duel was especially worrying because it was ``destabilizing
the situation in a nuclear context.''
	   India's Defense Ministry said the heavy artillery fell quiet for
the first time in a week on Thursday, although Indian and Pakistani
troops traded sporadic small-arms fire.
	   The rivalry between the two countries has led to three
conventional wars in the past 50 years, and the subcontinent is
considered the world's most likely nuclear flashpoint. Two of the
three wars have been over Kashmir.
	   In a speech this week, Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee
declared India would not be the first to use nuclear weapons,
dropping his previous linkage to a reciprocal declaration by
Pakistan.
	   But Ambassador Qazi told foreign reporters Pakistan would not
respond in kind. ``We have a problem with that, being the smaller
power,'' he said. Nuclear weapons provide ``a measure of strategic
parity and a credible defense against a larger country.''

	   Talks broke down on Monday when Butler refused to supply an
immediate certification that Iraq has destroyed all its weapons of
mass destruction _ chemical and biological arms and long-range
missiles.
	   Butler had said he found Aziz's stance puzzling because the
commission is close to saying Iraq has no weapons of mass
destruction in some areas.
	   On Thursday, Iraq told weapons inspectors that they can only
monitor sites already checked. It also banned surprise checks by
the U.N. nuclear agency.
	   Iraq said it believed Butler's attention to detail and his
demand for documentation was a ploy to extend the sanctions at the
behest of the United States.
	   U.S. Ambassador Bill Richardson welcomed the council statement.
	   ``The United States is very pleased with the outcome of the
meeting,'' Richardson said. ``We were also very pleased with the
forcefulness of the Secretary-General's briefing in a statement''

Security Council: Freezing cooperation `totally unacceptable'

	   UNITED NATIONS (AP) _ Iraq's freeze of cooperation with UN
weapons inspectors is ``totally unacceptable,'' the Security
Council declared today, calling for the urgent resumption of
dialogue between inspectors and Iraq.
	   Hinting that it could nonetheless lift some sanctions, the
Security Council said it ``intends to respond favorably to future
progress made in the disarmament process.''
	   The statement was read by the current president of the Security
Council, Slovenian Ambassador Danilo Turk, during a break in the
council's consideration of the breakdown in talks and the
subsequent freeze in cooperation.
	   U.S. Ambassador Bill Richardson welcomed the Council statement,
which was agreed to unanimously.
	   ``The United States is very pleased with the outcome of the
meeting,'' Richardson said. ``We were also very pleased with the
forcefulness of the Secretary-General's briefing in a statement''
	   Secretary-General Kofi Annan strongly backed his weapons
inspection chief, Richard Butler, increasingly under siege in
recent months by some Council members _ notably Russia and France _
for not giving the Iraqis a clean bill of health. Butler has done a
``very good job,'' Annan said.
	   ``The decision that (Iraq has) taken is in violation of Security
Council resolutions and the Memorandum of Understanding,'' he said,
referring to the agreement he extracted from Iraqi President Saddam
Hussein in February, the last time Iraq cut off the inspectors.
That agreement averted an attack on Iraq by the United States and
Britain.
	   But Annan advised assuaging Iraqi anger.
	   ``It might be helpful to engage the Iraqis much more closely
than we have hitherto done,'' he said.
	   Annan said he had spoken with Iraqi Deputy Prime Minister Tariq
Aziz, and that the Iraqi position is ``not a closed one.''
	   Talks broke down Monday when Butler refused to supply an
immediate certification that Iraq has destroyed all of its weapons
of mass destruction _ chemical and biological arms and long-range
missiles.
	   Iraq told weapons inspectors today that they can only monitor
sites already checked. It also banned surprise checks by the U.N.
nuclear agency.
	   The Iraqis have complained that Butler's attention to detail and
his demand for documentation was a ploy to extend the sanctions at
the behest of the United States. Butler had said he found Aziz's
stance puzzling because the commission is close to saying Iraq has
no weapons of mass destruction in some areas.
	   The sanctions were imposed eight years ago Thursday to punish
Iraq for its 1990 invasion of Kuwait, which led to the Persian Gulf
War.

Sudanese opposition leaders to meet in Egypt
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   CAIRO, Egypt (AP) _ Sudanese opposition leaders will meet here
next week at Egypt's request to talk about keeping Sudan united, a
Sudanese opposition official said Thursday.
	   The principal leaders who will attend the three-day conference
beginning Monday are the head of the Sudan People's Liberation
Army, John Garang, former Prime Minister Sadiq el-Mahdi and the
head of the National Democratic Alliance, Mohammed Osman
al-Mirgani, said Farouq Abu Issa, a spokesman for the alliance,
which is the umbrella group of Sudan's opposition parties.
	   Egypt fears that the civil war in southern and eastern Sudan
could lead to a break up of the country that would affect the
control of the Nile river _ which is Egypt's major source of water.
	   Also on Thursday, representatives of the Sudanese government and
the Garang's rebels held a third day of talks in Addis Ababa,
Ethiopia. The talks concentrated on the boundaries of southern
Sudan and the role of the Islam in the south, whose people are
mainly Christian and animist.
	   Garang's guerrillas have been fighting since 1983 for greater
autonomy for the south from the Islamic north.
	   More than 1.5 million people have died in the fighting and
consequent famines.
	   El-Mahdi was prime minister until he was overthrown in 1989 by a
military faction headed by President Omar el-Bashir.

Garrido, Lawrie lead quartet as others struggle on tough course
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; EDS: RESTORES dropped AP logo; edits. &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   BAD SAAROW, Germany (AP) _ Defending champion Ignacio Garrido of
Spain showed signs of breaking out of his season-long slump with a
5-under 67 Thursday, taking a share of the first-round lead at the
German Open.
	   Garrido joined Scotland's Paul Lawrie, New Zealand's Michael
Campbell and Frenchman Olivier Edmond atop the leaderboard at the
dlrs 1.15 million European PGA Tour event.
	   Despite sunny skies and a slight breeze, most players struggled
on the Nick Faldo-designed course, noted for its undulating
fairways and deep bunkers.
	   Only 52 of 156 players broke par, and both Lawrie and Campbell
registered double bogeys.
	   ``I've had lower rounds this year, but this has to be my best,
considering how tough the course is,'' Lawrie said.
	   The double bogey by Campbell, who finished third at the 1995
British Open, cost him a two-stroke lead heading into the 18th
hole. His drive sailed left into the bunker.
	   England's Russell Claydon was one stroke back, followed at 69 by
a trio of Englishmen: Andrew Beal, Steve Webster and Andrew
Sandywell.
	   Garrido offset five birdies with two bogies, and eagled the
par-5 344-meter (376-yard) 12th hole.
	   Garrido finished sixth in the Volvo rankings last year and
earned his only European tour victory at Stuttgart, but has missed
eight cuts this season.
	   ``You go up and down so easily in this game and I had a bad
patch,'' said Garrido, who blamed his problems on putting. ``Last
year I'd finish 15th and think what a bad week. This year,
finishing 30th, I would think that was good.''
	   During his round, the Spaniard sank an 5 1-2-meter (18-foot)
putt for a birdie followed by antoher from 7 1-2 meters (25 feet)
for his eagle.
	   Germany's Bernhard Langer, a five-time winner of the event,
struggled with stomach cramps and shot 74. At one point, he threw
his club in frustration.
	   ``I haven't won a tournament this year,'' the two-time U.S.
Masters champion said. ``But I'm still highly motivated.''

Jacklin blunders again
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   PORTRUSH, Northern Ireland (AP) _ Four years after he was
disqualified for signing for the wrong score, Tony Jacklin hit more
trouble on his return to the Senior British Open Thursday when he
picked up a 2-shot penalty for hitting the wrong ball.
	   On the day England's Jim Rhodes carded a 4-under 68 to take a
1-stroke lead, Jacklin come home in 76 after a round of blunders at
Royal Portrush.
	   They started at the second hole when the former U.S. and British
Open champion hooked his drive into the rough, found a ball and hit
it only to find he had played the wrong one.
	   After the two-shot penalty he eventually ended up with a
double-bogey seven and went on to finish with a four-over-par
round.
	   ``It was not the nicest thing to happen in my first competitive
round at Portrush,'' Jacklin said.
	   His only other appearance in the Senior British Open was at
Royal Lytham St Annes in 1994, when he was disqualified for signing
for an incorrect score in the first round.
	   Rhodes birdied the first two holes, dropped a shot at the
seventh but came up with three more birdies in a row from the ninth
to take the lead in the 375,000-pound (dlrs 619,000) championship.
	   Northern Ireland's David Jones was on course for the lead, but
three dropped shots in the last three holes meant a 69.
	   Scotland's Iain Clark also finished three under par, while
defending champion Gary Player was a further shot back.

After vanishing from Italian plates, regional names return
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   ROME (AP) _ Five years after they disappeared from Italian
license plates, a source of fierce pride for Italians -- provincial
names -- is coming back.
	   Italians howled back in 1993 when, to conform to European Union
regulations, authorities decided to ban the initials identifying
Italy's provinces.
	   Romans in particular were proud of their plates. Rome was the
only province in the country that was allowed the entire name
spelled out -- Roma -- on the plate, while other provinces were
limited to a two-letter abbreviation.
	   After police complained that the new plates without provincial
indications made it harder to track down in a hurry owners of the
vehicles, Italian authorities on Thursday announced a compromise.
	   Starting next year, the abbreviation of the province will be
squeezed into the right-hand corner of the plate, which will also
carry the symbol of the European Union and a capital ``I'' to
indicate Italy.

Warnings of humanitarian crisis in Guinea Bissau on eve of peace
</HEADLINE>
talks

<TEXT>
	   LISBON, Portugal (AP) _ Aid workers warned Thursday that food
and medicine were not getting through to hundreds of thousands of
people displaced by the two-month-old conflict in Guinea Bissau.
	   The warning came on the eve of a second round of talks between
President Joao Bernardo Vieira's government and a rebel military
faction, both of which signed a ceasefire agreement 10 days ago.
	   Almost all of the capital Bissau's population of 300,000 fled to
nearby towns when an attempted military coup on June 7 was followed
by fierce fighting.
	   ``A cholera epidemic looms due to the huge concentrations of
people, poor hygiene, lack of drinking water and the rainy
season,'' World Health Organization spokesman Inusse Noormahoned
told the Portuguese news agency Lusa on Thursday.
	   He called for the urgent opening of aid corridors into the tiny
West African state wedged between Senegal and Guinea, Lusa said.
	   The WHO and three other United Nations' relief agencies arrived
in Guinea Bissau this week to try to secure the free flow of aid to
the displaced population.
	   Senegalese troops backing Vieira have blocked Guinea Bissau's
northern border, preventing aid from reaching rebel-held areas,
Lusa reported.
	   ``The Senegalese authorities hinder our operations with
bureaucratic demands,'' said a spokeswoman from International
Medical Assistance, a Portuguese relief group working in Gabu, 200
kilometers (125) northeast of Bissau.
	   Aid shipped directly to Bissau's port has also had difficulty
reaching its destination, Lusa reported.
	   Some 600 tons of food supplies sent by the Portuguese
authorities in July were still stacked at the harbor awaiting
official clearance for distribution, the agency said.
	   A second round of talks between the rebels and the government
were due to begin Friday, brokered by a delegation from
Portuguese-speaking countries, on a Portuguese frigate moored just
off the coast of Bissau.
	   The conflict began when a group of military veterans, who fought
a 14-year colonial war against Portugal, mutinied after Vieira
dismissed Brig. Ansumane Mane as armed forces chief of staff.
	   Mane, who was accused of running arms to Senegal's Casamance
separatists, countered that Vieira was corrupt and demanded the
president step down.
	   No reliable numbers were available for the number of people who
died in the fighting.

Security Council: Freezing cooperation `totally unacceptable'

<TEXT>
	   UNITED NATIONS (AP) _ Iraq's freeze of cooperation with UN
weapons inspectors is ``totally unacceptable,'' the Security
Council declared Thursday, calling for the urgent resumption of
dialogue between inspectors and Iraq.
	   Hinting that it could nonetheless lift some sanctions, the
Security Council said it ``intends to respond favorably to future
progress made in the disarmament process.''
	   The statement was read by the current president of the Security
Council, Slovene Ambassador Danilo Turk, during a break in the
council's consideration of the breakdown in talks and the
subsequent freeze in cooperation.

Anglican bishops slap U.S. church over women priests
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By ROBERT BARR &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   CANTERBURY, England (AP) _ Anglican bishops gave their moral
support Thursday to four U.S. bishops of the Episcopal Church who
have refused to permit women priests in their dioceses.
	   The resolution, which says there should be ``no compulsion on
any bishop in matters concerning ordination and licensing,''
disagrees with changes in canon law adopted last year by the
Episcopal Church. The canons gave the recalcitrant bishops until
the year 2000 to comply.
	   The U.S. church began ordaining women in 1976, and now has an
estimated 1,500 women priests - about 10 percent of the total.
About half of the national churches within Anglicanism now ordain
women as priests and three, in the United States, New Zealand and
Canada, have consecrated women bishops.
	   As a consultative body of the 70 million worldwide Anglican
community, the Lambeth Conference has no authority to override the
decision of any national church.
	   However, the resolution does give important moral support to the
bishops of Fort Worth, Texas; Eau Claire, Wisconsin; Quincy,
Illinois; and San Joaquin, California.
	   The resolution was proposed by the Rt. Rev. Penny Jamieson,
bishop of Dunedin, New Zealand, one of 11 women bishops at the
Lambeth Conference. The test, worked out in meetings with a group
of traditionalist bishops, urged, ``courtesy, tolerance, mutual
respect and prayer for one another.''
	   ``While the language indeed, seems gracious, it contravenes the
ordination canons of the Episcopal Church, U.S.A., and, I believe
the discipline in the provinces of Canada and New Zealand,'' said
the Rt. Rev. Barbara Harris, bishop of Massachusetts, and first
women Anglican bishop.
	   The Rt. Rev Catherine Waynick, bishop of Indianapolis, also
opposed the resolution.
	   ``What sort of unity would we be able to sustain in our
worldwide communion if provinces were not able to articulate their
own internal disciplines for themselves on any given issue?''
Waynick said.
	   The Rt. Rev. Michael Scott-Joynt, bishop of Winchester, England,
said he supported the ordination of women but opposed any coercion
of opponents.
	   Every report of coercion ``makes it all the harder for the many
people in all our churches who are seeking to hold in the greatest
possible fellowship those who take differing views on the
ordination of women,'' he said.
	   The Rt. Rev. Ray Smith of Sydney, Australia, warned against
forgetting assurances which were given to traditionalists when
Anglican churches began ordaining women.
	   ``There is a danger of traditionalists being coerced against the
conscience to do certain things, to allow to certain things, or if
they cannot comply, to be forced out of the communion,'' he said.

Netanyahu calls on Arafat to condemn attack

<TEXT>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu called on
Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat Thursday to condemn a grisly
double killing of two Jewish settlers.
	   ``Arafat should condemn and oppose such crimes,'' Netanyahu
said.
	   Arafat's aides said the Palestinian leader would be prepared to
condemn the West Bank attack in the framework of an interview put
was not planning any public statement on the killings.
	   Palestinian Planning Minister Nabil Shaath said a formal
condemnation was not necessary.
	   ``I think there is a standing condemnation, we condemn terror,
we condemn violence, whether it comes from our side or the settler
side,'' Shaath told Israel Television.
	   With tensions between the sides running high one day after the
killings, Israeli and Palestinian negotiators did not resume talks
aimed at solving a long overdue Israeli troop withdrawal from the
West Bank.
	   Netanyahu however said he wanted discussions to continue with
negotiators placing a stronger emphasis on Israel's security
concerns.
	   Negotiators held their last round of direct talks over an
Israeli troop withdrawal one day before the attack and the talks
have not resumed.
	   The sides have been haggling over the scope of an withdrawal as
laid out in a U.S. peace proposal, with little progress. The
Palestinians accepted the plan but Israel has not, saying a 13
percent withdrawal would harm its security.
	   A majority of Jewish Israelis are in favor of an Israeli
withdrawal from West Bank territory, according to a Tel Aviv
University survey released Thursday. According to the poll, 60
percent of the 504 Jewish adults polled, were in favor of a 13
percent withdrawal. Thirty-one percent said they were opposed and
the remaining 9 percent had no opinion. The margin of error was 4.5
percent.
	   Both Israel and the Palestinians have asked several times for
further American intervention to reach a deal on the withdrawal.
	   Thursday, negotiators took their cases to Jordanian Crown Prince
Hassan in Amman, Jordan.
	   Chief Palestinian negotiator Saeb Erekat said he visited Hassan
to ask for Jordan's help in convincing the United States to
pressure Israel to accept its initiative.
	   ``We have traveled all the roads we possibly could with the
Israeli side through the series of meetings,'' Erekat said, ``But
the Israelis presented ideas that in no way comply with the signed
agreements or the American initiative,'' Erekat said.
	   However, Israeli Public Security Minister Avigdor Kahalani
delivered a message to the prince that Israel and the Palestinians
were close to resolving problems holding up the troop withdrawal
from the West Bank.
	   Settler leaders say Netanyahu's latest pullback offer _ rejected
Tuesday by Arafat as giving the Palestinians too little land _
instead concedes too much territory, leaving settlements vulnerable
to attack.
	   Netanyahu met with settler leaders Thursday to discuss which
areas Israel was considering a pullback from.
	   During a visit to the families of the two young men slain at
Wednesday, President Ezer Weizman said efforts to reach peace must
continue despite the attack.
	   ``I think the peace process is an important historic step. There
is a large controversy and of course this tragedy has not helped.
But we must show great strength and courage to continue with it
(the peace process),'' Weizman told reporters.
	   The Israeli army said it lifted a curfew late Thursday on five
Palestinian villages near Itzhar, where soldiers were searching for
suspects in Wednesday's killings. Police spokesman Ofir Sivan said
no arrests have been made.

Warnings of humanitarian crisis in Guinea Bissau on eve of peace
</HEADLINE>
talks

<TEXT>
	   LISBON, Portugal (AP) _ Aid workers warned Thursday that food
and medicine were not getting through to hundreds of thousands of
people displaced by the two-month-old conflict in Guinea Bissau.
	   The warning came on the eve of a second round of talks between
President Joao Bernardo Vieira's government and a rebel military
faction, both of which signed a ceasefire agreement 10 days ago.
	   Almost all of the capital Bissau's population of 300,000 fled to
nearby towns when an attempted military coup on June 7 was followed
by fierce fighting.
	   ``A cholera epidemic looms due to the huge concentrations of
people, poor hygiene, lack of drinking water and the rainy
season,'' World Health Organization spokesman Inusse Noormahoned
told the Portuguese news agency Lusa on Thursday.
	   He called for the urgent opening of aid corridors into the tiny
West African state wedged between Senegal and Guinea, Lusa said.
	   The WHO and three other United Nations' relief agencies arrived
in Guinea Bissau this week to try to secure the free flow of aid to
the displaced population.
	   Senegalese troops backing Vieira have blocked Guinea Bissau's
northern border, preventing aid from reaching rebel-held areas,
Lusa reported.
	   ``The Senegalese authorities hinder our operations with
bureaucratic demands,'' said a spokeswoman from International
Medical Assistance, a Portuguese relief group working in Gabu, 200
kilometers (125 miles) northeast of Bissau.
	   Aid shipped directly to Bissau's port has also had difficulty
reaching its destination, Lusa reported.
	   Some 600 tons of food supplies sent by the Portuguese
authorities in July were still stacked at the harbor awaiting
official clearance for distribution, the agency said.
	   A second round of talks between the rebels and the government
were due to begin Friday, brokered by a delegation from
Portuguese-speaking countries, on a Portuguese frigate moored just
off the coast of Bissau.
	   The conflict began when a group of military veterans, who fought
a 14-year colonial war against Portugal, mutinied after Vieira
dismissed Brig. Ansumane Mane as armed forces chief of staff.
	   Mane, who was accused of running arms to Senegal's Casamance
separatists, countered that Vieira was corrupt and demanded the
president step down.
	   No reliable numbers were available for the number of people who
died in the fighting.

Some improvement since stroke but still in intensive care
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   LOS ANGELES (AP) _ Australian tennis legend Rod Laver has shown
some improvement since suffering a stroke but he is not out of
danger, his doctor said Thursday.
	   Dr. Neil A. Martin said the retired Grand Slam champion would
face lengthy rehabilitation when he is moved out of intensive care
at the University of California, Los Angeles Medical Center.
	   ``I think there's a fighting chance he'll be up and walking
around. It's going to take months,'' said the neurosurgeon,
co-director of the UCLA Stroke Center.
	   Laver, who will be 60 on Sunday, suffered the stroke July 27.
	   The doctor said Laver was responding to antibiotics administered
for a fever and there was some improvement in his weakened right
arm.
	   Laver was in stable condition but ``not entirely out of
danger,'' the physician said.
	   Martin said Laver would remain in intensive care for several
more days.

Burton hopes to stay in winner's circle
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BEAVERCREEK, Ohio (AP) _ Brandie Burton wants that winning
feeling to linger for a while.
	   Fresh from a victory at the du Maurier Classic in Canada, Burton
hopes to make it two in a row this weekend at the Star Bank LPGA
Classic.
	   The field of 129 players got in their final practice strokes
Thursday in preparation for the opening round of the 54-hole
tournament Friday at the 6,302-yard (5,735-meter) Country Club of
the North.
	   Burton, who had a brilliant amateur career and was LPGA Rookie
of the Year at 19, won three tournaments in 1993. But she had been
winless until last weekend's victory.
	   ``Hopefully, it will be easy to carry the momentum into this
week,'' Burton said.
	   Injuries and burnout had combined to keep her out of the
winner's circle.
	   ``I played injured and got into some bad swing habits,'' she
said. ``It got to the point where I didn't like the game anymore.''
	   After the 1996 Solheim Cup matches in Wales, Burton took a break
from golf.
	   She spent time with her family, worked out and did a little
fishing. She has been healthy for more than a year.
	   ``I feel good,'' she said. ``I'm excited to be playing golf
again, even before I won last week.''
	   The field will include defending champion Colleen Walker, who
shot a tournament record 13-under-par 203 last year.
	   Burton had a one-stroke, first-round lead over Walker, but
Walker birdied three of the last four holes in the final round to
win.
	   This year's field includes six other 1998 LPGA tournament
winners: Lisa Walters, Rosie Jones, Tammie Green, Donna Andrews,
Pat Hurst and Dale Eggeling.
	   LPGA Hall of Famers Pat Bradley and Patty Sheehan also are
competing.
	   Notably absent is Se Ri Pak, winner of two majors who is taking
a break after playing in six straight tournaments.

	   BUDAPEST, Hungary (AP) _ The widow of a British clergyman
murdered a year ago visited her husband's convicted murderers
Thursday, the state news agency MTI reported.
	   She even planted a kiss of forgiveness on one of the convicts'
cheek.
	   Only two of the three convicted killers were willing to meet
with Jo Valerie Pollard.
	   ``I am happy and grateful this meeting could be arranged and I
hope we can do this again,'' MTI quoted Mrs Pollard, 56, as saying.
	   ``We did not want it to end in such a tragedy,'' said one of the
young killers, not identified by the news agency.
	   Michael Trevor Pollard, 63, and his wife, Jo Valerie, who holds
British and New Zealand dual citizenship, were on their way to
Romania in a van, taking children's clothing and toys for
distribution.
	   Their van broke down near Nyiregyhaza, 160 kilometers (100
miles) east of Budapest, late Aug. 5.
	   In the course of the night, they were attacked by the three
youths who robbed them and beat them so severely that Pollard died
in the vehicle from blood entering his lungs. His wife was beaten
unconscious and hospitalized.
	   She attended their trial and sentencing earlier this year and
repeatedly told them she forgave them.
	   Istvan Dudas, a 19-year-old bricklayer who first admitted to
attacking the couple but then withdrew his confession, received 11
years in prison.
	   His accomplices, Attila Bilecz, a 23-year-old driver, and Laszlo
Mester, 23, an unemployed cobbler, who both maintained that they
had not been involved in the beating, only the robbery, were
sentenced to seven and six years, respectively.

	   DAMASCUS, Syria (AP) _ Archaeologists have unearthed a rock
carved with what may be the figure of Jesus Christ and a large
Byzantine mosaic in eastern Syria, the official Syrian News Agency
said Thursday.
	   The mosaic is believed to have been the floor of a church in
Tartus, a town on Syria's Mediterranean coast 160 miles northwest
of Damascus.
	   Measuring 28 meters by 24 meters (31 yards by 26 yards), the
mosaic is considered ``the biggest that has ever been discovered in
the coastal region,'' Rashid Issa, the head of Tartus' Department
of Antiquities, told SANA.
	   He said the mosaic displayed ``geometric shapes and
decorations.''
	   Archaeologists believe a figure carved on rock they have
excavated is that of Christ, but it may be that of a saint.
	   In Byzantine times, Tartus was famous for its devotion to the
Virgin Mary. There is still a Christian community in the Tartus
district and a place called the Valley of the Christians.

Former Civil Guard gets prison leave to see baby

	   MADRID, Spain (AP) _ A former Civil Guard chief serving a
28-year jail term for embezzlement has been granted special leave
to see his newborn son, news reports said Thursday.
	   Luis Roldan, 54, has been in prison since February after being
convicted of amassing 14 million dollars illegally while running
Spain's paramilitary police force from 1986 to 1993.
	   His wife became pregnant late last year during a visit to the
jail where Roldan was being held during his trial, the state news
agency Efe reported.
	   Ironically, another high-profile figure convicted of
embezzlement the same month as Roldan was also granted prison leave
this week.
	   Mario Conde, a banker serving four years and two months for
defrauding Banesto of 4.3 million dollars, is to be allowed out of
jail two weekends per month.

<TEXT>
	   ISLAMABAD, Pakistan (AP) _ Pakistani Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif
named new men Thursday to direct the key areas of finance and
foreign affairs as his government struggled to ward off economic
collapse and repair international ties strained by nuclear tests.
	   An information ministry spokesman confirmed the long-rumored
changes late Thursday. Former Finance Minister Sartaj Aziz was
shifted to foreign affairs, while respected economist Hafeez Pasha
was named special finance adviser. Pasha is not in parliament, and
so could not be named minister.
	   The outspoken Gohar Ayub, who as foreign minister had had
undiplomatically tough words for neighboring India after it
conducted nuclear tests in May, was moved to minister of water and
power. That post is particularly important with Pakistan pledging
to step up its privatization drive by selling off state utilities,
and following disputes over tariffs with private power providers.
	   Former water and power minister Raja Nadir Pervaiz took the
until-now vacant communications ministry. In other changes, Sardar
Yaqub Nasir, who faces corruption charges, was dropped as minister
for railways and not yet replaced; Shahid Khaqan Abbasi was named
to the vacant defense production ministry; and Sheikh Rasheed was
stripped of his sports and culture portfolio but left in charge of
labor.
	   Pakistan answered India's tests with test of its own in May, and
both countries were internationally condemned. They both also were
hit with economic sanctions by the United States, Japan and other
industrialized nations. India has withstood the sanctions
relatively well, while Pakistan's already battered economy was hit
hard.
	   Economic observers have speculated Pakistan may have to default
on or delay payments on its dlrs 30 billion foreign debt.
	   Aziz told the private Pakistani NNI news agency that his move
from finance to foreign should not be seen as a judgment that he
had mishandled the economy. He said the move had been in the works
since April, before the May nuclear tests brought the country's
economic troubles to a head.
	   Yaseen Lakhani, head of the Karachi Stock Exchange, said Aziz's
finance background will help Pakistan as it tries to persuade
foreign countries and international lending agencies to lift
anti-nuclear economic sanctions.
	   The announcement came hours after stock markets closed. Lakhani
said he expected a muted reaction Friday morning, because the
changes had been expected, and because traders were more worried
about factors such as fears of war with India and uncertainty over
sanctions than ``a few in-house movements in the ministries.''
	   Ilyas Bilour, president of the Federation of Pakistan Chambers
of Commerce and Industry, expressed respect for newly appointed
finance adviser Pasha, but noted his job would not be easy.
	   ``Let's hope he can deliver the goods,'' Bilour said.
	   Pasha has held important academic posts in Pakistan and is known
_ and respected _ as a technocrat rather than a politician. He
served as caretaker commerce minister in 1993 and has been deputy
planning chief since 1996.

	   UNITED NATIONS (AP) _ The Security Council declared Iraq's
freeze of cooperation with U.N. weapons inspectors ``totally
unacceptable'' on Thursday, but left the door open for greater
engagement with Iraq.
	   The statement, agreed to by all 15 members of the council,
called for an ``urgent resumption'' of dialogue between inspectors
and Iraq.
	   ``The Security Council called the Iraqi action totally
unacceptable,'' said the Council's current president, Slovene
delegate Danilo Turk.
	   ``It contravenes relevant Security Council resolutions and the
Memorandum of Understanding,'' he said, referring to the agreement
Secretary-General Kofi Annan extracted from Iraq in February, the
last time Iraq prevented the inspectors from doing their jobs.
	   That agreement averted an attack on Iraq by the United States
and Britain.
	   Hinting that it could nonetheless lift some sanctions, the
Security Council said it ``intends to respond favorably to future
progress made in the disarmament process.''
	   Greater engagement was also counseled by Annan, who postponed a
trip to Portugal to attend Thursday's council session.
	   ``I believe the Iraqi position on this issue is not a closed
one,'' he said. ``...It might be helpful to engage the Iraqis much
more closely than we have.''
	   The conciliatory tone reflected international weariness with the
issue _ a factor that the Iraqis hope will accelerate the lifting
of sanctions, which were imposed eight years ago to punish Iraq for
invading Kuwait.
	   Russia and France have financial interests in Iraq, and other
nations are concerned at the humanitarian effect of the sanctions,
which the Iraqis blame for the deaths of 500 children a month.
	   ``We need to see deeds, not words,'' Said Hasan, the Iraqi
charge d'affaires at the United Nations, said dismissively of the
report to the council by weapons inspector chief Richard Butler.
``We are frustrated, we are fed up.''
	   Talks broke in Iraq down on Monday when Butler refused to supply
Deputy Prime Minister Tariq Aziz with an immediate certification
that Iraq has destroyed all its weapons of mass destruction _
chemical and biological arms and long-range missiles.
	   Butler got strong support from his boss on Thursday.
	   Butler has done a ``very good job,'' Annan said. He seemed
especially incensed at Iraq's suggestion that the inspectorate,
UNSCOM, be moved to Geneva or Vienna in order to decrease U.S.
influence.
	   ``No individual member state can tell the U.N. how to structure
itself to carry out tasks or mandates given to it,'' he said.
	   On Thursday, Iraq told weapons inspectors that they can only
monitor sites already checked. It also banned surprise checks by
the U.N. nuclear agency.
	   Iraq said it believed Butler's attention to detail and his
demand for documentation was a ploy to extend the sanctions at the
behest of the United States.
	   Butler had said he found the stance puzzling because the
commission is close to saying Iraq has no weapons of mass
destruction in some areas.
	   U.S. Ambassador Bill Richardson welcomed the council statement.
	   ``The United States is very pleased with the outcome of the
meeting,'' Richardson said. ``We were also very pleased with the
forcefulness of the Secretary-General's briefing in a statement''

Laver faces months of treatment for stroke

<TEXT>
	   LOS ANGELES (AP) _ Rod Laver remained in the intensive care unit
at UCLA Medical Center Thursday, and probably will be hospitalized
for months while recovering from a moderate stroke.
	   Dr. Neil Martin, Laver's neurosurgeon and co-director of the
UCLA Stroke Center, said at a news conference that Laver was in
stable condition.
	   ``We still anticipate he'll be in the intensive care unit for
another few days, and in the hospital for a week or so,'' Martin
said. ``Physical therapy will be the next big step after he gets
out of the hospital. He'll be staying as an inpatient for physical
therapy (at an inpatient rehabilitation ward). He won't be going
home.
	   ``I think there's a fighting chance he'll be up and walking
around. It's going to take months.''
	   Laver, who will be 60 Sunday, suffered the stroke July 27 during
a taped television interview. He was moved out of the intensive
care unit last Friday, but went back in several hours later after
developing a fever.
	   Martin said the former tennis great was responding to
antibiotics administered for the fever, and there was some
improvement in his weakened right arm.
	   ``He's not entirely out of danger at this point,'' Martin said.
``He's a bit disoriented. He is ... bearing up under the
circumstances.''
	   Martin said what Laver has experienced since suffering the
stroke is not necessarily atypical.
	   ``There's a great variety of what can happen after a stroke,''
the doctor said. ``The odd person will sail through.''
	   Laver, an Australian who lives in Newport Beach, California, is
the only player to win two Grand Slams, accomplishing the feat as
an amateur in 1962 and as a pro seven years later.
	   In his career, he won four Wimbledon singles championships,
three Australian singles titles, two U.S. Open singles
championships and two French singles titles.

	   PRISTINA, Yugoslavia (AP) _ While fighting persisted Thursday in
two areas of Kosovo at a lower level than before, international
relief workers worried about how to care for some 200,000 Kosovo
refugees.
	   ``The situation in Kosovo has deteriorated significantly and can
now only be described as a humanitarian disaster,'' said a
statement from Carol Bellamy, executive director of the U.N.
Children's Fund (UNICEF).
	   ``The principal victims of the escalating violence are children
and women. Some 200,000 people have been displaced facing daily
terror, the loss of their homes, severe malnutrition and a range of
health crises,'' the statement said.
	   ``If concerted and effective international initiative is not
taken soon, world leaders risk seeing the situation in Kosovo
escalate to grotesque levels of violence and brutality,'' it added.
	   The refugees have been displaced by the current offensive
launched by Serbian forces seeking to push back and defeat the
underground Kosovo Liberation Army fighting for the independence
for Kosovo.
	   Kosovo is a province in southern Serbia where ethnic Albanians
represent 90 percent of the population. Serbia and the smaller
republic of Montenegro make up what is left of Yugoslavia.
	   Hundreds have been killed since Serbian forces cracked down on
the guerillas in March, and particularly in their latest offensive.
Kosovo's unofficial President Ibrahim Rugova declared Friday a day
of mourning.
	   Earlier in the day, Serb sources said there was fierce fighting
along the main Pristina-Prizren road near the village of Crnoljevo,
southwest of Kosovo's capital, and clashes continued near the
besieged village Junik, close the Albanian border.
	   But reporters traveling in the countryside Thursday got the
impression that the Serbian campaign was gradually winding down.
Their observations appeared to be confirmed by a report of the
ethnic Albanian Kosovo Information Center.
	   It said fighting continued in the border area around Junik and
near Djakovica, but with much less intensity than on previous days.
	   An ethnic Albanian arrested by police after the fighting in the
central town of Orahovac died in custody Thursday, the center
claimed. It also said KLA fighters held their own in western Kosovo
between the twons of Decani, Klina and Djakovica.
	   It claimed Serbian forces killed four KLA fighters, while the
Serbs lost 17 men. The report could not be verified.
	   In Belgrade, Vojislav Seselj, an ultranationalist and currently
a Serbian vice premier, called for a thorough strike against the
Kla, saying ``no village must remain under their control ... There
must be no yielding to pressures from Western powers who would
dismember the territory of Serbia.''

Peru's military denies imprisoned rebel receives special treatment
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   LIMA, Peru (AP) _ Military authorities on Thursday denied
allegations by a top minister that imprisoned Shining Path leader
Abimael Guzman receives special privileges, including music and the
company of his lover.
	   Prime Minister Javier Valle Riestra said Wednesday that Guzman,
who founded the bloody Maoist rebel movement, received privileges
not enjoyed by other jailed rebels, and spent his time ``listening
to Wagner and Bach.''
	   In contrast, the leader of the smaller Tupac Amaru Revolutionary
Movement, Victor Polay, lived in virtual isolation in a tiny cell
in the same prison, allowed outside his cell only a half hour each
day, he said.
	   He called on the government to offer Polay the same privileges.
	   Valle Riestra's comment angered military officials who have used
tough measures to virtually wipe out Peru's once-powerful guerrilla
groups.
	   ``All persons sentenced for treason, serving sentences in
maximum security prisons, do it under equal conditions, without
privileges of any kind,'' said a statement from the Supreme Court
of Military Justice.
	   Both Guzman and Polay were captured by anti-terrorism police in
1992 and serve life sentences in an ultra-secret naval prison in
Lima's port of Callao.
	   Guzman's cell is next to that of his lover and fellow rebel
Elena Iparraguirre, Valle Riestra said.
	   Tupac Amaru rebels in December 1996 raided a diplomatic party at
the Japanese ambassador's residence in Lima, taking hundreds of
hostages in a failed attempt to free their imprisoned comrades,
including Polay.
	   During the crisis, the rebels referred to the prisons their
comrades were held in as ``tombs.''
	   Peru's war against leftist rebels has left 30,000 people dead
since 1980, but violence fell sharply following the capture of the
rebel leaders.

Congo threatens war against Rwanda, rebels advance on Kabila's old

<TEXT>
	   KINSHASA, Congo (AP) _ Rwandan soldiers and Tutsi rebels were
advancing Thursday across this vast African nation in a scene
eerily reminiscent of Congo President Laurent Kabila's own march to
power last year.
	   As the conflict widened, Kabila's government threatened war
against neighboring Rwanda, which it accused of masterminding the
uprising.
	   ``The war will be long and popular, that is, the whole people of
Congo will defend their nation and sovereignty,'' said Kabila, who
appeared in a pair of green army fatigues Thursday evening before
journalists and government officials clad in military uniforms.
	   ``The people must defend themselves and not kneel,'' the
president said, vowing to recover territory lost to the rebels and
form Socialist-style civilian ``defense committees'' to protect
communities.
	   Government spokesman Didier Mumenge warned Congo would ``extend
the war into Rwanda'' unless the international community pressured
the tiny country to withdraw Rwandan troops allegedly deployed
across its borders in Congo.
	   Congo's Justice Minister Mwenze Kongolo also pledged to
retaliate against Rwanda, Kabila's one-time ally.
	   ``This war started in Rwanda and it is going to end in Rwanda,''
Kongolo said on CNN.
	   The rebel offensive is believed led by many of the same ethnic
Tutsi fighters _ known as Banyamulenge _ and Rwandan soldiers, also
Tutsis, who played a key role in Kabila's victory over longtime
dictator Mobutu Sese Seko last year.
	   And as before, the renegades have quickly captured Congo's
eastern cities near Rwanda's borders, while moving west through the
jungle interior _ just as Kabila did in the early days of his
eight-month march to power.
	   Rwanda has repeatedly denied involvement in the conflict, but
aid workers and other eyewitnesses say they have seen Rwandan
troops.
	   Key rebel gains in eastern Congo included the cities of Bukavu
and Goma near the border with Rwanda, which were reportedly seized
Wednesday. Fighting continued Thursday in the city of Kisangani
further into the interior, according to aid workers and rebel
sources.
	   A government official, however, said Kisangani was firmly in
loyalists' hands.
	   Fighting in Uvira, the town south of Bukavu that was apparently
captured on Thursday, killed about 30 Banyamulenge fighters,
according to Joseph Mutambo, deputy leader of a new rebel-linked
political party formed there.
	   A leader of the mutineers, speaking on a rebel radio station,
denied Rwandan involvement.
	   ``This is a struggle of the Congolese people,'' said Arthur
Z'Ahidi Ngoma, a veteran opposition figure who was at one time
briefly jailed by Kabila's regime.
	   At the opposite end of the country, gun battles continued in the
Atlantic coastline town of Muanda and the nearby village of Kitona,
Rwandan radio and Congolese government officials said.
	   That fighting erupted after a group of rebels landed a hijacked
plane Monday in Kitona, which is adjacent to a government military
base.
	   Ethnic bitterness at the Banyamulenge and Rwandan Tutsis boiled
over in Kinshasa at a demonstration by thousands of protesters who
called for guns to join the fight against the Rwandans.
	   ``Give us weapons to go to Rwanda,'' demonstrators sang.
	   The demonstrators, mostly students and supporters of Kabila's
ruling party, held aloft two stuffed effigies bearing the images of
former leading government officials _ both Tutsis _ who have
apparently joined the renegades.
	   Two goats representing the two _ Deogratias Bugera, a former
Kabila confidante, and ex-Foreign Minister Bizima Karaha _ were
sacrificed at the end of the protest.
	   Meanwhile, three South African ministers planned to fly to
Congo's southern city of Lubumbashi on Friday to meet with Kabila
over the hostilities.
	   Zimbabwe has said it plans to host a summit of regional leaders
Friday or Saturday over the conflict.
	   Britain urged its citizens Thursday to leave the Congo because
of the risk of a serious escalation in fighting, and the United
Nations evacuated all 77 nonessential staff and their families from
Kinshasa to Abidjan, Ivory Coast. About 20 U.N. workers remained in
the capital.
	   France and the United States had earlier warned their nationals
to leave.

Netanyahu calls on Arafat to condemn attack
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with reax from Palestinian official on condemnation,
grafs 4-5, Israeli opinion poll in graf 10, curfew lifted in final
graf &QL; 
 &UR; By DINA KRAFT &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu called on
Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat Thursday to condemn a grisly
double killing of two Jewish settlers.
	   ``Arafat should condemn and oppose such crimes,'' Netanyahu
said.
	   Arafat's aides said the Palestinian leader would be prepared to
condemn the West Bank attack in the framework of an interview put
was not planning any public statement on the killings.
	   Palestinian Planning Minister Nabil Shaath said a formal
condemnation was not necessary.
	   ``I think there is a standing condemnation, we condemn terror,
we condemn violence, whether it comes from our side or the settler
side,'' Shaath told Israel Television.
	   With tensions between the sides running high one day after the
killings, Israeli and Palestinian negotiators did not resume talks
aimed at solving a long overdue Israeli troop withdrawal from the
West Bank.
	   Netanyahu however said he wanted discussions to continue with
negotiators placing a stronger emphasis on Israel's security
concerns.
	   Negotiators held their last round of direct talks over an
Israeli troop withdrawal one day before the attack and the talks
have not resumed.
	   The sides have been haggling over the scope of an withdrawal as
laid out in a U.S. peace proposal, with little progress. The
Palestinians accepted the plan but Israel has not, saying a 13
percent withdrawal would harm its security.
	   A majority of Jewish Israelis are in favor of an Israeli
withdrawal from West Bank territory, according to a Tel Aviv
University survey released Thursday. According to the poll, 60
percent of the 504 Jewish adults polled, were in favor of a 13
percent withdrawal. Thirty-one percent said they were opposed and
the remaining 9 percent had no opinion. The margin of error was 4.5
percent.
	   Both Israel and the Palestinians have asked several times for
further American intervention to reach a deal on the withdrawal.
	   Thursday, negotiators took their cases to Jordanian Crown Prince
Hassan in Amman, Jordan.
	   Chief Palestinian negotiator Saeb Erekat said he visited Hassan
to ask for Jordan's help in convincing the United States to
pressure Israel to accept its initiative.
	   ``We have traveled all the roads we possibly could with the
Israeli side through the series of meetings,'' Erekat said, ``But
the Israelis presented ideas that in no way comply with the signed
agreements or the American initiative,'' Erekat said.
	   However, Israeli Public Security Minister Avigdor Kahalani
delivered a message to the prince that Israel and the Palestinians
were close to resolving problems holding up the troop withdrawal
from the West Bank.
	   Settler leaders say Netanyahu's latest pullback offer _ rejected
Tuesday by Arafat as giving the Palestinians too little land _
instead concedes too much territory, leaving settlements vulnerable
to attack.
	   Netanyahu met with settler leaders Thursday to discuss which
areas Israel was considering a pullback from.
	   During a visit to the families of the two young men slain at
Wednesday, President Ezer Weizman said efforts to reach peace must
continue despite the attack.
	   ``I think the peace process is an important historic step. There
is a large controversy and of course this tragedy has not helped.
But we must show great strength and courage to continue with it
(the peace process),'' Weizman told reporters.
	   The Israeli army said it lifted a curfew late Thursday on five
Palestinian villages near Itzhar, where soldiers were searching for
suspects in Wednesday's killings. Police spokesman Ofir Sivan said
no arrests have been made.

Iraq steps up pressure on U.N. weapons inspectors

<TEXT>
	   BAGHDAD, Iraq (AP) _ Making good on its threat to limit arms
inspections, Iraq Thursday banned surprise checks by the U.N.
nuclear agency and told weapons inspectors they can only monitor
sites already checked.
	   The moves follow President Saddam Hussein's decision Wednesday
to freeze cooperation with U.N. weapons inspectors and the
International Atomic Energy Agency. The development threatens to
renew a dispute that nearly started a war six months ago with the
United States and Britain.
	   An IAEA spokesman said the organization has been told it can no
longer carry out surprise inspections of Iraq's nearly defunct
nuclear program.
	   ``We have been told by the government of Iraq that our
activities will be limited to certain declared sites. This is not
acceptable and we are contacting the president of the Security
Council,'' the spokesman, David Kyd, said in Vienna, Austria.
	   In another defiant step, Iraqi escorts refused to accompany a
team of weapons experts from the United Nations Special Commission,
forcing them to abandon their planned searches Thursday, a
government official told The Associated Press.
	   The weapons teams cannot work without escorts under a United
Nations agreements with Iraq.
	   The UNSCOM team was not allowed to conduct ``discussions with
Iraqi authorities on arms or visits to sites or searches for past
weapons,'' the official said, on condition of anonymity.
	   The Iraqi News Agency denied any team was blocked from working,
but did not mention if escorts were refused to the inspectors. U.N.
officials refused to comment on whether any inspectors were kept
from doing their jobs.
	   The U.N. Security Council issued a unanimous statement later
Thursday declaring that Iraq's freeze of cooperation was ``totally
unacceptable.''
	   Speaking to reporters afterwards U.N. Secretary-General Kofi
Annan said Iraq's decision was ``in violation of Security Council
resolutions and the Memorandum of Understanding'' which he had
drawn up with Iraqi President Saddam Hussein in February.
	   The memorandum averted U.S. and British air strikes on Iraq over
its decision to prevent U.N. inspectors from entering presidential
compounds.
	   U.S. Ambassador to the United Nations Bill Richardson welcomed
the council statement and said he was pleased with the stand that
Annan had taken.
	   In London, British Foreign Secretary Robin Cook said Iraq must
fulfill its obligations to the United Nations. ``This latest move
will only delay the moment when the Security Council can consider
the removal of sanctions,'' he said.
	   Britain has been a staunch opponent of relaxing U.N. sanctions
on Iraq. France _ another permanent Security Council member that
has sought to ease the strictures _ said Saddam's declaration of
non-cooperation was ``unacceptable.''
	   ``France asks Iraq not to implement its decision,'' a French
Foreign Ministry statement said.
	   Saddam took the confrontational stand after Butler refused
Monday to provide an immediate certification that Iraq has
destroyed all its weapons of mass destruction _ chemical and
biological arms and long-range missiles.
	   Such a testimonial by UNSCOM is necessary before the Security
Council will lift economic sanctions imposed in 1990 after Iraq's
invasion of Kuwait.
	   Butler has said that he was close to giving a thumbs up on
Iraq's chemical and missile programs but needed more information on
biological weapons.
	   Saddam's Wednesday directive allows weapons experts to continue
monitoring activities.
	   While inspections tend to be surprise visits of suspected
weapons sites, monitoring is an ongoing process and includes repeat
visits to places already checked and keeping an eye through cameras
installed at sites.
	   On Thursday, convoys of U.N. vehicles carrying some monitoring
officials left the U.N. headquarters on Baghdad's eastern outskirts
followed by cars with Iraqi officials. No one interfered with their
work.
	   ``Ongoing monitoring continues,'' U.N. spokesman Janet Sullivan
told the AP.
	   About 460 sites in Iraq have been inspected and are under
monitoring. About 100 U.N. experts visit the sites or use
remote-controlled cameras and sensors.
	   Last month, Saddam demanded that the sanctions be lifted by the
end of this year, the first time he set a deadline.
	   That and the latest developments reflect the growing
frustrations in Iraq with the eight-year-old sanctions, which have
crippled the economy by banning the free sale of oil, the country's
largest revenue earner.

Iraq steps up pressure on U.N. weapons inspectors

 &UR; RETRANSMITTING to fix lead sequence

	   BAGHDAD, Iraq (AP) _ Making good on its threat to limit arms
inspections, Iraq Thursday banned surprise checks by the U.N.
nuclear agency and told weapons inspectors they can only monitor
sites already checked.
	   The moves follow President Saddam Hussein's decision Wednesday
to freeze cooperation with U.N. weapons inspectors and the
International Atomic Energy Agency. The development threatens to
renew a dispute that nearly started a war six months ago with the
United States and Britain.
	   An IAEA spokesman said the organization has been told it can no
longer carry out surprise inspections of Iraq's nearly defunct
nuclear program.
	   ``We have been told by the government of Iraq that our
activities will be limited to certain declared sites. This is not
acceptable and we are contacting the president of the Security
Council,'' the spokesman, David Kyd, said in Vienna, Austria.
	   In another defiant step, Iraqi escorts refused to accompany a
team of weapons experts from the United Nations Special Commission,
forcing them to abandon their planned searches Thursday, a
government official told The Associated Press.
	   The weapons teams cannot work without escorts under a United
Nations agreements with Iraq.
	   The UNSCOM team was not allowed to conduct ``discussions with
Iraqi authorities on arms or visits to sites or searches for past
weapons,'' the official said, on condition of anonymity.
	   The Iraqi News Agency denied any team was blocked from working,
but did not mention if escorts were refused to the inspectors. U.N.
officials refused to comment on whether any inspectors were kept
from doing their jobs.
	   The U.N. Security Council issued a unanimous statement later
Thursday declaring that Iraq's freeze of cooperation was ``totally
unacceptable.''
	   Speaking to reporters afterwards U.N. Secretary-General Kofi
Annan said Iraq's decision was ``in violation of Security Council
resolutions and the Memorandum of Understanding'' which he had
drawn up with Iraqi President Saddam Hussein in February.
	   The memorandum averted U.S. and British air strikes on Iraq over
its decision to prevent U.N. inspectors from entering presidential
compounds.
	   U.S. Ambassador to the United Nations Bill Richardson welcomed
the council statement and said he was pleased with the stand that
Annan had taken.
	   In London, British Foreign Secretary Robin Cook said Iraq must
fulfill its obligations to the United Nations. ``This latest move
will only delay the moment when the Security Council can consider
the removal of sanctions,'' he said.
	   Britain has been a staunch opponent of relaxing U.N. sanctions
on Iraq. France _ another permanent Security Council member that
has sought to ease the strictures _ said Saddam's declaration of
non-cooperation was ``unacceptable.''
	   ``France asks Iraq not to implement its decision,'' a French
Foreign Ministry statement said.
	   Saddam took the confrontational stand after Butler refused

Archaeologists find possible Christ carving, big church mosaic

<TEXT>
	   DAMASCUS, Syria (AP) _ Archaeologists have unearthed a rock
carved with what may be the figure of Jesus Christ and a large
Byzantine mosaic in eastern Syria, the official Syrian News Agency
said Thursday.
	   The mosaic is believed to have been the floor of a church in
Tartus, a town on Syria's Mediterranean coast 160 miles northwest
of Damascus.
	   Measuring 28 meters by 24 meters (31 yards by 26 yards), the
mosaic is considered ``the biggest that has ever been discovered in
the coastal region,'' Rashid Issa, the head of Tartus' Department
of Antiquities, told SANA.
	   He said the mosaic displayed ``geometric shapes and
decorations.''
	   Archaeologists believe a figure carved on rock they have
excavated is that of Christ, but it may be that of a saint.
	   In Byzantine times, Tartus was famous for its devotion to the
Virgin Mary. There is still a Christian community in the Tartus
district and a place called the Valley of the Christians.

Congo threatens war against Rwanda, rebels take Kabila's old path

<TEXT>
	   KINSHASA, Congo (AP) _ Rwandan soldiers and Tutsi rebels were
advancing Thursday across this vast African nation in a scene
eerily reminiscent of Congo President Laurent Kabila's own march to
power last year.
	   As the conflict widened, Kabila's government threatened war
against neighboring Rwanda, which it accused of masterminding the
uprising.
	   ``The war will be long and popular, that is, the whole people of
Congo will defend their nation and sovereignty,'' said Kabila, who
wore a pair of green army fatigues Thursday while addressing
government officials clad in military uniforms.
	   ``The people must defend themselves and not kneel,'' the
president said, vowing to recover territory lost to the rebels and
form Socialist-style civilian ``defense committees'' to protect
communities.
	   Government spokesman Didier Mumenge warned Congo would ``extend
the war into Rwanda'' unless the international community pressured
the tiny country to withdraw Rwandan troops allegedly deployed in
Congo.
	   Congo's Justice Minister Mwenze Kongolo also pledged to
retaliate against Rwanda, Kabila's one-time ally.
	   ``This war started in Rwanda and it is going to end in Rwanda,''
Kongolo said on CNN.
	   The rebel offensive is believed led by many of the same Tutsi
fighters _ known as Banyamulenge _ and Rwandan soldiers, also
Tutsis, who played a key role in Kabila's victory over longtime
dictator Mobutu Sese Seko last year.
	   And as before, the renegades have quickly captured Congo's
eastern cities near Rwanda's borders, while moving west through the
jungle interior _ just as Kabila did in the early days of his
eight-month march to power.
	   Rwanda has repeatedly denied involvement in the conflict, but
aid workers and other eyewitnesses say they have seen Rwandan
troops.
	   Key rebel gains in eastern Congo included the cities of Bukavu
and Goma near the border with Rwanda, which were reportedly seized
Wednesday. Fighting continued Thursday in the city of Kisangani
further into the interior, according to aid workers and rebel
sources.
	   A government official, however, said Kisangani was firmly in
loyalists' hands.
	   Uvira, south of Bukavu, was captured on Thursday, ending
fighting that killed about 30 Banyamulenge fighters, according to
Joseph Mutambo, deputy leader of a new rebel-linked political
party.
	   At the opposite end of the country, gun battles continued in the
Atlantic coastline town of Muanda and the nearby village of Kitona,
various reports said.
	   That fighting erupted after a group of rebels landed a hijacked
plane Monday in Kitona, which is adjacent to a government military
base.
	   Ethnic bitterness at the Banyamulenge and Rwandan Tutsis boiled
over in Kinshasa at a demonstration by thousands of protesters who
called for guns to join the fight against the Rwandans.
	   ``Give us weapons to go to Rwanda,'' demonstrators sang.
	   The demonstrators carried two stuffed effigies bearing the
images of former leading government officials _ both Tutsis _ who
have apparently joined the renegades.
	   Two goats representing the two _ Deogratias Bugera, a former
Kabila confidante, and ex-Foreign Minister Bizima Karaha _ were
sacrificed at the end of the protest.
	   Britain urged its citizens Thursday to leave Congo and the U.N.
evacuated its 77 non-essential staff members from Kinshasa. France
and the United States had earlier warned their nationals to leave.

</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: NEW with Thursday's early games; will be updated &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   NEW YORK (AP) _ Jose Mesa walked home the winning run for the
second time in three games Thursday, giving the New York Mets a
wild 9-8 victory over the San Francisco Giants.
	   The Mets, whose bullpen blew a four-run lead in the eighth
inning by giving up two three-run homers, rallied with a run in the
eighth and two in the ninth.
	   The Giants had been 49-0 when leading after eight innings.
	   New York hit four home runs and moved within 2 1/2 games of the
idle Chicago Cubs in the National League wild-card race. John
Olerud homered and extended his hitting streak to 20 games for the
Mets.
	   With New York trailing 8-7, Olerud singled to open the ninth off
Robb Nen (7-3), and moved to third on pinch-hitter Matt Franco's
single to right. Brian McRae's single scored Olerud to tie it 8-8
as Franco took third.
	   Lenny Harris was walked intentionally to load the bases, and
Giants manager Dusty Baker brought in Mesa, who walked Harris with
the bases loaded on Tuesday to hand the Mets a 7-6 win in 10
innings.
 &UR; Rockies 5, Pirates 1
	   In Pittsburgh, Dante Bichette hit his 200th career home run as
the Colorado Rockies beat Pittsburgh 5-1 on Thursday, keeping
Pirates starter Jason Schmidt winless in 12 consecutive starts.
	   Schmidt (8-9) is 0-8 since he became the National League's first
eight-game winner on June 1. He has the longest losing streak by a
Pittsburgh pitcher since Jose DeLeon lost 11 straight decisions in
1985. He allowed four runs, three earned, in seven innings.
	   Bichette's 17th homer came after Neifi Perez singled in the
seventh.
 &UR; Expos 9, Dodgers 0
	   In Montreal, Jeremy Powell combined with two relievers on a
two-hitter and rookie Terry Jones homered and drove in four runs
Thursday as the Expos pounded former teammate Carlos Perez in a win
over the Los Angeles Dodgers.
	   Powell (1-1) allowed only a one-out single to Trenidad Hubbard
in the first and a leadoff single to Eric Young in the sixth _ his
last inning _ in getting his first major league win.
	   Powell, who struck out three and walked one, has allowed one
earned run in 12 innings over his two starts.
	   Mike Maddux pitched two perfect innings and Anthony Telford
pitched the ninth for Montreal's third shutout of the season.

	   SOFIA, Bulgaria (AP) _ Todor Zhivkov, Bulgaria's Communist
dictator for 35 years and the Soviet bloc's last surviving
Stalinist leader, has died, officials announced Thursday. He was
86.
	   Zhivkov died Wednesday night in a Sofia hospital, the office of
Bulgaria's reformist president, Petar Stoyanov, announced. Zhivkov
had fallen into a coma after being hospitalized July 8 with a
respiratory infection, officials at Losenets Hospital were quoted
by the official BTA news agency as saying. He also had suffered
from diabetes and other ailments in recent months.
	   Zhivkov held the record among his eastern European peers for
time in office _ from 1954 until his fall in the anti-communist
revolutions of 1989.
	   Stoyanov expressed his condolences Thursday to Zhivkov's family
but said in a public statement that Zhivkov oversaw ``one of the
darkest periods of recent Bulgarian history.''
	   ``Eight million Bulgarians lived during that long period with
their work, dreams and illusions, but also in fear and political
repression,'' Stoyanov said. ``With the death of Todor Zhivkov the
era of Bulgarian communism is finally ending.''
	   Zhivkov outlived his former Kremlin bosses and other Balkan
dictators: Yugoslavia's Josip Broz Tito died in 1980, and Albania's
Enver Hoxha in 1985. Romania's Nicolae Ceausescu was executed in
1989.
	   But his dominant presence at home had long faded. Radio and
television reported his death briefly, but public fear and anger
toward the ex-dictator once known as ``Papa Zhivkov'' had turned
largely to apathy, with many younger Bulgarians now unaware of his
impact.
	   Dimitar Georgiev, a 46-year-old technician in Sofia, said he
approved of Bulgaria's rulers having ``let the old man die in
peace.''
	   ``After all,'' he said, ``Zhivkov was part of history, for good
or bad.''
	   Among sparse international reaction to become public, the
Russian Communist Party called his death an irreparable loss
because Zhivkov ``always was a true friend of our country.''
	   ``Nobody will be able to drop Zhivkov's name from the history of
Bulgaria or his contribution to the advancement of the country,''
the party's presidium said, according to Russia's Interfax news
agency.

Iraq steps up pressure on U.N. weapons inspectors

	   BAGHDAD, Iraq (AP) _ Making good on its threat to limit arms
inspections, Iraq on Thursday banned surprise checks by the U.N.
nuclear agency and told weapons inspectors they can only monitor
sites already checked.
	   The moves follow President Saddam Hussein's decision Wednesday
to freeze cooperation with U.N. weapons inspectors and the
International Atomic Energy Agency. The development threatens to
renew a dispute that nearly started a war six months ago with the
United States and Britain.
	   An IAEA spokesman said the organization has been told it can no
longer carry out surprise inspections of Iraq's nearly defunct
nuclear program.
	   ``We have been told by the government of Iraq that our
activities will be limited to certain declared sites. This is not
acceptable and we are contacting the president of the Security
Council,'' the spokesman, David Kyd, said in Vienna, Austria.
	   In another defiant step, Iraqi escorts refused to accompany a
team of weapons experts from the United Nations Special Commission,
forcing them to abandon their planned searches Thursday, a
government official told The Associated Press.
	   The weapons teams cannot work without escorts under a United
Nations agreements with Iraq.
	   The UNSCOM team was not allowed to conduct ``discussions with
Iraqi authorities on arms or visits to sites or searches for past
weapons,'' the official said, on condition of anonymity.
	   The Iraqi News Agency denied any team was blocked from working,
but did not mention if escorts were refused to the inspectors. U.N.
officials refused to comment on whether any inspectors were kept
from doing their jobs.
	   The U.N. Security Council issued a unanimous statement later
Thursday declaring that Iraq's freeze of cooperation was ``totally
unacceptable.''
	   Speaking to reporters afterwards U.N. Secretary-General Kofi
Annan said Iraq's decision was ``in violation of Security Council
resolutions and the Memorandum of Understanding'' which he had
drawn up with Iraqi President Saddam Hussein in February.
	   The memorandum averted U.S. and British air strikes on Iraq over
its decision to prevent U.N. inspectors from entering presidential
compounds.
	   U.S. Ambassador to the United Nations Bill Richardson welcomed
the council statement and said he was pleased with the stand that
Annan had taken.
	   In London, British Foreign Secretary Robin Cook said Iraq must
fulfill its obligations to the United Nations. ``This latest move
will only delay the moment when the Security Council can consider
the removal of sanctions,'' he said.
	   Britain has been a staunch opponent of relaxing U.N. sanctions
on Iraq. France _ another permanent Security Council member that
has sought to ease the strictures _ said Saddam's declaration of
non-cooperation was ``unacceptable.''
	   Saddam took the confrontational stand after Butler refused
Monday to provide an immediate certification that Iraq has
destroyed all its weapons of mass destruction _ chemical and
biological arms and long-range missiles.
	   Such a testimonial by UNSCOM is necessary before the Security
Council will lift economic sanctions imposed in 1990 after Iraq's
invasion of Kuwait.
	   Butler has said that he was close to giving a thumbs up on
Iraq's chemical and missile programs but needed more information on
biological weapons.
	   Saddam's Wednesday directive allows weapons experts to continue
monitoring activities.
	   While inspections tend to be surprise visits of suspected
weapons sites, monitoring is an ongoing process and includes repeat
visits to places already checked and keeping an eye through cameras
installed at sites.
	   About 460 sites in Iraq have been inspected and are under
monitoring. About 100 U.N. experts visit the sites or use
remote-controlled cameras and sensors.
	   Last month, Saddam demanded that the sanctions be lifted by the
end of this year, the first time he set a deadline.
	   That and the latest developments reflect the growing
frustrations in Iraq with the eight-year-old sanctions, which have
crippled the economy by banning the free sale of oil, the country's
largest revenue earner.

	   KINGSTON, Jamaica (AP) _ Spicy ``jerk'' chicken is a Jamaican
specialty. But jerk ostrich? Veterinarian-turned-rancher Marc
Panton wants to get it on the menu.
	   Panton, 27, has opened a ranch in southwestern St. Elizabeth to
raise the long-legged foul, and he is hoping tourists will snap up
ostrich burgers, ostrich steaks _ maybe even sweet-and-sour ostrich
_ at local hotels.
	   The 100-acre farm already has nine adult birds and 19 young
ones, including an 8-foot-tall (2.4-meter-tall) prize breeder named
Mandela. Panton says he hopes to have more than 100 by 2000.
	   He said he'll hawk ostrich wallets and the birds' gargantuan
eggs to gift shops.
	   ``We'll be looking into the sale of accessory items like their
skin _ one of the world's most expensive leathers _ as well as
feathers and egg shells which we have painted and will sell as
souvenirs,'' Panton said.
	   For tourists with a yen for big bird watching, the farm is open
to the public. It has a small petting zoo, ponds for fishing and an
herb garden.
	   Ostrich and emu farms, once found only in Africa, have
multiplied in other countries, especially in the western United
States.
	   The meat, which has fewer calories, less fat and less
cholesterol than skinless chicken, now sells in the United States
for dlrs 14 to 16 a pound. Panton thinks he can sell for less, and
he's looking to a lucrative export market in Japan, where ostrich
toenails are sold as an aphrodisiac.
	   The farm has the blessing of the government, said agriculture
minister Roger Clarke.
	   ``The demand is there for the production of the meat,'' Clarke
said. ``Anything which seeks to diversify our agriculture
production _ especially where, like in this instance, there is a
niche market _ there has to be encouragement.''

Former rebels appear to soften stance in Angola
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By CASIMIRO SIONA &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   LUANDA, Angola (AP) _ Angola's former rebel movement UNITA sent
a message of hope Thursday to a top U.N. envoy who is trying to
save the country's fragile peace process.
	   ``I bring news,'' Isaias Samakuva, a key member of UNITA's
leadership, told reporters on his arrival in the capital Luanda
from the group's highland headquarters in Andulo.
	   Samakuva said he would reveal his news at an emergency meeting
Friday of the Joint Commission overseeing Angola's peace process,
due to be attended by U.N. special envoy Lakhdar Brahimi.
	   Brahimi arrived last Friday on an emergency mission prompted by
increased tension between the government of President Jose Eduardo
dos Santos and UNITA.
	   The massacre of 100 civilians in a remote village in July, and
reported military buildup on both sides, appeared to indicate an
imminent slide back into civil war.
	   Following a meeting in Andulo with UNITA chief Jonas Savimbi,
Brahimi announced on Wednesday that the former rebels had promised
to reestablish a political base in the capital.
	   Samakuva heads UNITA's delegation on the Joint Commission that
also includes representatives from the government, the U.N. and
diplomats from the United States, Portugal and Russia.
	   His retreat to Andulo two months ago signaled that communication
had been completely severed between the government and UNITA, a
Portuguese acronym for the Union for the Total Independence of
Angola.
	   Both sides have consistently blamed the other for the crisis.
	   Following his meeting with Dos Santos, Brahimi said the
government had promised to tone down its anti-UNITA media campaign.
	   About 500,000 people died in Angola's two-decade-long civil war
between the government and UNITA, fueled by Cold War geopolitics.
	   A U.N.-brokered deal in 1994 established a tenuous peace, but
implementation has long been bogged down in delays.
	   UNITA's refusal to relinquish control of its remaining rural
strongholds has been a particular sticking point, triggering the
U.N to impose heavy sanctions.
	   Brahimi, who has kept a low profile for most of his week-long
stay in Angola, was due to speak to reporters on Saturday before
leaving for Namibia to meet with President Sam Nujoma. In July
Nujoma and Dos Santos agreed on a ``security pact'' to contain
UNITA.
	   Meanwhile the crisis is far from over. Asked whether a return to
civil war could be avoided, Samakuva replied ``I don't know.''

<TEXT>
	   MEXICO CITY (AP) _ Mexico's stock market, battered by
uncertainty in New York and jitters over emerging markets, plunged
to its fifth straight loss on Thursday, hitting its lowest point
since May 1997.
	   Mexico's peso also slipped to a midrate of 9.021 per dollar.
	   The stock market's key IPC index closed down 1.8 percent, or
73.59 points, to 3981.73 points. At the end of 1997, the IPC stood
at 5229.35.
	   Volume totaled 35.9 million shares worth 605.2 million pesos.
	   The Dow Jones Industrial Average closed up 0.4 percent, but
stocks fell across most of Asia and Europe.
	   On 48-hour spot dollar markets here, banking leader Banamex
quoted the peso closing at a midrate of 9.021 per dollar,
marginally stronger from its open of 9.029 per dollar but weaker
from its close Wednesday of 9.005.

	   KINGSTON, Jamaica (AP) _ Spicy ``jerk'' chicken is a Jamaican

Security Council: Iraq's freeze `totally unacceptable.'
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: RECASTS throughout to raise lack of clear plans; NEW quotes by
U.S., Chinese ambassadors &QL; 
 &UR; By RON KAMPEAS &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   UNITED NATIONS (AP) _ Memo to Iraq from the United Nations: the
freeze on cooperation with U.N. weapons inspectors is totally
unacceptable _ but you've got our attention.
	   Thursday's strongly worded Security Council condemnation of
Iraq's cold shoulder to weapons chief Richard Butler failed to
outline what the 15-member council planned to do about it _ except
to engage Iraq more closely.
	   ``The Security Council called the Iraqi action totally
unacceptable,'' the council's current President, Slovene delegate
Danilo Turk, told reporters.
	   ``It contravenes relevant Security Council resolutions and the
Memorandum of Understanding,'' he said, referring to the agreement
Secretary General Kofi Annan extracted in February, the last time
Iraq cut off the inspectors from doing their jobs.
	   That agreement averted an attack on Iraq by the United States
and Britain.
	   This time, however, there seemed to be little appetite for a
fight _ and Turk ended his statement without outlining what the
Security Council planned to do, except sound a conciliatory note.
	   ``The Security Council intends to respond favorably to future
progress made in the disarmament progress,'' he said.
	   The soft talking was echoed by Annan.
	   ``I believe the Iraqi position on this issue is not a closed
one,'' said Annan, who had consulted with Iraqi Deputy Prime
Minister Tariq Aziz before attending the council session. ``... It
might be helpful to engage the Iraqis much more closely than we
have,'' he said.
	   Even U.S. Ambassador Bill Richardson _ who said the United
States was ``very pleased'' with the Security Council statement _
sounded a less combative note.
	   ``We are acting in consultation with the U.N. Security
Council,'' he said. ``This is not a battle between the United
States and Iraq.''
	   In February, the United States and Britain threatened unilateral
action if Iraq did not back down _ and sent forces to the Gulf to
prove it.
	   This time, the statement's plea for increased dialogue got the
unanimous approval of all 15 council members.
	   ``The issues can only be settled through dialogue and
negotiations,'' said Chinese Ambassador Qin Huasun. ``There is no
other choice.''
	   The conciliatory tone reflected international weariness with the
issue _ a factor that the Iraqis hope will accelerate the lifting
of sanctions, which were imposed eight years ago to punish Iraq for
invading Kuwait.
	   Russia and France have financial interests in Iraq, and other
nations are concerned at the humanitarian effect of the sanctions,
which the Iraqis blame for the deaths of 500 children a month.
	   ``We need to see deeds, not words,'' Said Hasan, the Iraqi
charge d'affaires at the United Nations, said dismissively of the
report to the council by Butler. ``We are frustrated, we are fed
up.''
	   Talks broke in Iraq down on Monday when Butler refused to supply
Aziz with an immediate certification that Iraq has destroyed all
its weapons of mass destruction _ chemical and biological arms and
long-range missiles.
	   Butler got strong support from his boss on Thursday.
	   Butler has done a ``very good job,'' Annan said. He seemed
especially incensed at Iraq's suggestion that the inspectorate,
UNSCOM, be moved to Geneva or Vienna in order to decrease U.S.
influence.
	   ``No individual member state can tell the U.N. how to structure
itself to carry out tasks or mandates given to it,'' he said.
	   On Thursday, Iraq told weapons inspectors that they can only
monitor sites already checked. It also banned surprise checks by
the U.N. nuclear agency.
	   Iraq said it believed Butler's attention to detail and his
demand for documentation was a ploy to extend the sanctions at the
behest of the United States.
	   Butler had said he found the stance puzzling because the
commission is close to saying Iraq has no weapons of mass
destruction in some areas.

Anglican bishops slap U.S. church over women priests
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: CORRECTS test to text in graf 6
 &UR; By ROBERT BARR &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   CANTERBURY, England (AP) _ Anglican bishops gave their moral
support Thursday to four U.S. bishops of the Episcopal Church who
have refused to permit women priests in their dioceses.
	   The resolution, which says there should be ``no compulsion on
any bishop in matters concerning ordination and licensing,''
disagrees with changes in canon law adopted last year by the
Episcopal Church. The canons gave the recalcitrant bishops until
the year 2000 to comply.
	   The U.S. church began ordaining women in 1976, and now has an
estimated 1,500 women priests - about 10 percent of the total.
About half of the national churches within Anglicanism now ordain
women as priests and three, in the United States, New Zealand and
Canada, have consecrated women bishops.
	   As a consultative body of the 70 million worldwide Anglican
community, the Lambeth Conference has no authority to override the
decision of any national church.
	   However, the resolution does give important moral support to the
bishops of Fort Worth, Texas; Eau Claire, Wisconsin; Quincy,
Illinois; and San Joaquin, California.
	   The resolution was proposed by the Rt. Rev. Penny Jamieson,
bishop of Dunedin, New Zealand, one of 11 women bishops at the
Lambeth Conference. The text, worked out in meetings with a group
of traditionalist bishops, urged, ``courtesy, tolerance, mutual
respect and prayer for one another.''

Ecuador asks for international aid after strong earthquakes
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   QUITO, Ecuador (AP) _ Ecuador on Thursday asked for
international aid to help more than 1,000 people left homeless by
two strong earthquakes that toppled buildings and houses along its
Pacific coast.
	   The twin quakes _ the first with a magnitude of 5.7, the second
7.1 _ killed three people and injured 40 in the coastal province of
Manabi on Tuesday, according to U.N. relief workers.
	   ``I understand that Ecuador's foreign minister has made an
international call for help and that we will be responding
immediately,'' said Ricardo Mena, a U.N. relief worker in Ecuador.
	   Most affected were the resort town of Bahia de Caraquez, 130
miles (220 kms) southwest of Quito, and the nearby town of Canoa,
where 1,000 people lost their homes and many survivors lack access
to safe drinking water.
	   President Fabian Alarcon has put Manabi on ``yellow alert,'' and
ordered rescue workers to prepare areas in schools and hospitals
for the homeless.
	   The government has asked for water supply equipment, building
materials, tents, tools, cash and kitchen utensils for the
homeless, U.N. workers said.
	   One woman died of a heart attack during the panic after the
quakes, and a young girl and a woman were crushed by falling walls
in different towns across Manabi.

Korean star signs new deal with Samsung

<TEXT>
	   ORLANDO, Florida (AP) _ Se Ri Pak has signed a new deal with
Samsung, which will pay her at least dlrs 1 million a year and free
her up to negotiate other endorsements with equipment companies.
	   The Korean-based electronics giant first signed Pak to a 10-year
contract in December 1996, and hired swing coach David Leadbetter
to refine her game.
	   Pak won the LPGA Championship in May and then won the U.S.
Women's Open, becoming the first women to win two major
championships before age 21.
	   ``I am grateful to Samsung for helping Se Ri become an
international star,'' her father, Joon-chul Pak, said in a
statement.
	   Samsung also awarded the 20-year-old Pak an honorary position
within the company, a Korean practice to honor notable figures.
	   ``Korea never had real sports marketing,'' said Yeong Shin, a
business adviser for the Pak family. ``Se Ri is the first case on a
global basis. I don't think we have any precedent on this issue.''
	   Yeong Shin, a business adviser for the Pak family, declined to
discuss the contract, but a source close to the situation said it
was for three years, and that the dlrs 1 million per year could be
even higher if the Korean economy improves.
	   The source also said other endorsements could be announced by
the end of the month. Pak uses Callaway clubs, an Odyssey putter
and plays the Maxfli revolution ball.
	   She now carries the logo of two companies _ Samsung on her bag
and front of her hat, and Astra on her clothing. Astra is an
apparel subsidiary of Samsung. Future endorsements could add to
that.
	   The Pak family also met with IMG during the du Maurier Classic
last week in Canada, although they have not reached an agreement.
	   Pak filmed television ads for Samsung this week at her home in
Orlando, Fla. She will leave Sunday for England to compete in the
British Women's Open at Royal Lytham and St. Annes.
	   Pak has been the biggest story to hit women's golf since Nancy
Lopez won five consecutive tournaments and nine overall during her
1978 rookie season.
	   After winning the U.S. Open, Pak set an LPGA scoring record with
a 61 in the Jamie Farr Kroger Classic, which she won by tying an
LPGA record for lowest 72-hole score.
	   She won her fourth tournament two weeks later, the Giant Eagle
LPGA Classic, but tied for 41st in the du Maurier in her bid to
become the first rookie to win three majors in a year.
	   ``Se Ri Pak no longer represents only Samsung,'' said Ho-moon
Ahn, a Samsung official who is one of her managers. ``She is the
pride of all Koreans. She has greatly boosted our collective spirit
during a time of national economic adversity.''

NBA labor talks break off
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By CHRIS SHERIDAN &QC; 
 &UR; AP Basketball Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   NEW YORK (AP) _ National Basketball Association labor talks came
to an abrupt halt Thursday when commissioner David Stern and
several owners walked out of the meeting after hearing the players'
latest proposal.
	   ``In our minds, if anything, we had a step backwards today,''
deputy commissioner Russ Granik said. ``They basically said they
want to see how they do on the legal front before they're going to
do any real bargaining. That's basically what they said.''
	   The meeting, attended by over a dozen players and a half-dozen
owners, lasted about 1 1/2 hours in the morning before breaking for
lunch. When the talks resumed, the players spent about 15 minutes
outlining their new proposal.
	   ``They got up and walked out,'' union director Billy Hunter
said. ``It seemed more feigned than anything else. It looked like a
charade.''
	   ``They acted like my 4-year-old daughter,'' said Karl Malone,
who attended a bargaining session for the first time in his career.
	   Today's meeting was the first since June 22, when talks broke
off after only 30 minutes. The owners imposed a lockout eight days
later.
	   The players' latest offer was a surprise, since Hunter and
Granik said Wednesday that did not know who should feel compelled
to submit the next formal proposal.
	   Owners have made four different offers, while the players had
made only one when talks began April 1.
	   The sides remain far apart on economic issues, especially on
what percentage of basketball-related income (BRI) should be
devoted toward player salaries. The owners had the right to toss
out the old labor agreement if salaries rose above 52 percent of
BRI, and that number jumped to 57 percent last season.
	   In their offer put on the table April 1, the players offered to
slow future salary cap growth if the BRI number exceeded 63
percent. They deleted that offer in today's proposal, replacing it
with an adjustment to the 20-percent raise rule.
	   ``We're not going to give them both. Both is too much,'' union
attorney Jeffrey Kessler said.
	   Under the old collective bargaining agreement, most contracts
were limited to 20 percent salary increases each season. In their
latest proposal, the players asked for minimum raises of 10 percent
with maximum raises tied to the percentage of growth in league
revenues.
	   ``They walked out as soon as they saw we weren't going to make a
proposal that incorporated a hard (salary) cap,'' Hunter said.
	   ``We could have told them anything and they would have walked
out,'' Malone said. ``If I hadn't been here, I would not have
believed this. It's hard to believe someone is taking their ball
and going home.''

U.S. Virgin Islands labor leaders unimpressed by pay bill
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   CHARLOTTE AMALIE, U.S. Virgin Islands (AP) _ Unions representing
government workers in the Virgin Islands said Thursday they are not
satisfied with a payment package just approved by the territory's
legislature.
	   The debt-ridden U.S. territory owes workers more than dlrs 170
million in back wages, and unions had hoped talks with Gov. Roy
Schneider would spur lawmakers to make up at least half that
amount.
	   The unions have been threatening a general strike since late
June.
	   On Tuesday legislators passed a bill that pays dlrs 20 million
to workers whose unions have finished negotiations over new
contracts. It also gives dlrs 20.5 million in raises to non-union
workers.
	   The retroactive pay issue, however, was left for later
discussion.
	   ``We'll take what they have, but it's not acceptable,'' Cecil
Benjamin, president of the St. Croix teachers' union, said
Thursday. ``We think it's grossly unfair.''
	   He and other union leaders said they would continue preparations
for a strike if Schneider does not intervene.

Household products with antibacterial agents may aid drug
</HEADLINE>
resistance &QL; 
 &UR; By JOSEPH B. VERRENGIA &QC; 
 &UR; AP Science Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   DENVER, Colorado (AP) _ An antibacterial agent widely used in
soaps, lotions and other consumer products triggers a genetic
change in bacteria that could widen the scope of life-threatening
drug resistance, a new study shows.
	   Now germ hunters from Tufts University Medical School in Boston
are hoping to capture some of the drug-resistant bacteria they
suspect may lurk in households where heavily advertised products
containing the compound triclosan are being used every day.
	   The researchers, whose study appears in Thursday's issue of
Nature, described the use of antibacterials outside of hospitals as
a ``fad that has crept up on us over the past three or four years
to the point where it is overwhelming when you go to the
supermarket.''
	   ``People think they are sterilizing the world by using these
products and, in fact, they are potentially changing it,'' said Dr.
Stuart Levy, director of the Tufts research group. ``They really
are over-the-counter antibiotics.''
	   Companies that use triclosan in their products said the agent
has been used safely for more than 30 years.
	   ``There is no real-world evidence of a link between resistant
bacteria and triclosan,'' said Glenn Cueman, president of North
Carolina-based Microban Inc., which adds the agent to inhibit germ
growth on plastics (which can go into the making of high-chair
trays).
	   The Tufts study was started because of infection experts'
concern that they are running out of medicines that they know will
kill dangerous bacteria.
	   Germs can genetically mutate into tougher super-strains if they
are repeatedly exposed to, but not killed by, antibiotic drugs and
antibacterial agents. Federal figures show the top six bacteria
found in hospitals are resistant to at least one drug.
	   Public health officials have blamed the indiscriminate
prescription of antibiotics by doctors for the spread of
drug-resistant bacteria.
	   The Tufts study suggests the recent widespread use of
antibacterial agents in everyday products _ toothpaste, bodywash,
shampoo and moisturizers _ might have similar results.
	   Triclosan is a more general-acting ``biocide.'' Effective in low
concentrations, it was assumed to work by dissolving the membrane
walls of bacteria.
	   Levy's group determined in tests on an E. coli bacterium that
triclosan actually has a specific target _ an enzyme involved in
making the bacterium's cell wall. The gene responsible for the
activity is FABI, Levy said.
	   Levy said it is the same biological target that a kind of
antibiotic uses to fight tuberculosis. TB, which kills up more than
3 million people annually worldwide, has become more difficult to
cure in the past decade with the emergence of several bacterial
strains that are resistant to conventional antibiotics.
	   The Tufts researchers cautioned that they have not found
resistant bacteria that are the product of triclosan exposure. But
now that they have determined that the compound works on a specific
genetic site, scientists said the potential for developing
resistance is much higher.
	   In upcoming investigation, Levy said his researchers will search
selected Boston-area households for bacteria with a mutated FABI
gene and see if it is resistant to triclosan and similar agents.

China offers to aid restoration of U.N.-Iraq dialogue
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BEIJING (AP) _ China on Thursday offered to mediate a political
settlement to the new rift in dialogue between Iraq and U.N.
weapons inspectors, the official Xinhua news agency reported.
	   ``We urge both parties to restore dialogue and cooperation at
the earliest date, and to resolve disputes through consultation,''
the agency quoted Foreign Ministry spokesman Tang Guoqiang saying.
	   China is prepared to work with all parties to stop the situation
from deteriorating further and promote a ``comprehensive and
balanced implementation'' of U.N. resolutions on Iraq, it quoted
Tang saying.
	   Iraqi leader Saddam Hussein announced Wednesday that he would
``completely suspend cooperation'' with U.N. weapons teams, forcing
a showdown over sanctions imposed on Iraq after the 1990 Persian
Gulf War.
	   During the last such crisis in February, China joined France and
Russia in discouraging military threats against Iraq and had since
sought to ease sanctions.
	   China, one of the five permanent members of the United Nations
Security Council, has mostly sided with Russia and France in urging
a speedy end to weapons inspections to allow the lifting of
sanctions.
	   That has sometimes set it against the United States and Great
Britain, which have taken a harder line on Iraq cooperation with
inspectors and compliance with disarmament demands.

<TEXT>
	   BOGOTA, Colombia (AP) _ Colombians hopeful that a new president
might attain peace were inundated Thursday by images of body bags
being loaded on helicopters, soldiers lying on stretchers and
relatives grieving.
	   A huge rebel offensive ahead of Andres Pastrana's swearing in
Friday as president has demonstrated just how strong the leftist
insurgents have become and how difficult it will be to make peace.
	   In fighting that tapered off Wednesday, guerrillas from the two
largest rebel factions exploded bombs in cities and towns, attacked
oil pipelines and a hydroelectric dam and hammered army and police
bases in about half the country with rockets, mortars and grenades.
	   The government said 71 soldiers and police were killed and 85
wounded by rebels of the 15,000-member Revolutionary Armed Forces
of Colombia, or FARC, and the 5,000-member National Liberation
Army, or ELN. About 100 security-force members were missing, it
said.
	   In one incident, rebels overran an important southern
anti-narcotics base in Miraflores, killing or dragging away dozens
of soldiers and police as possible bargaining chips.
	   The rebel commander who organized the raid, Jorge Briceno, told
reporters by two-way radio that guerrillas took more than 100
prisoners. The army confirmed 73 soldiers were missing from
Miraflores.
	   The onslaught was a rude welcome for Pastrana, who met in the
jungles of Colombia last month with Briceno and another top FARC
leader and agreed to start peace talks with the 34-year-old rebel
group by November.
	   ``Sometimes you have to work for peace in the midst of war,'' an
undeterred Pastrana told reporters Wednesday.
	   Grim-faced army leaders said they repelled the offensive and
called it a military and political failure for the rebels.
Colombian military analysts disagreed.
	   ``It's the largest disaster in the history of the insurgency,
and it comes on top of an entire chain of disasters over the past
three years,'' said Alfredo Rangel, a former presidential national
security advisor.
	   In March, the rebels killed 62 soldiers and seized 43 others in
an attack blamed by army leaders on intelligence failures of the
same sort that apparently failed to anticipate this week's
guerrilla actions.
	   The 120,000-member army has been unable to counter an
increasingly bold and well-trained rebel force that has gained in
wealth and firepower in part through stepped up revenues from
ransom kidnappings and ``war taxes'' on cocaine production in
rebel-controlled areas.
	   The guerrillas have gone in recent years from occasional
ambushes of small groups of soldiers and simple harassment, to
assaults by hundreds of rebels on heavily fortified army and police
bases, such as the Miraflores base overrun on Monday.
	   The challenge for the peace-seeking Pastrana, observers say,
will be to reform and strengthen an ineffective and demoralized
military.
	   ``The guerrillas at this moment have many more cards to
negotiate with,'' said Rangel. ``They have much more bargaining
power for having carried out this demonstration of force.''

Jamaica honors 88 citizens
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   KINGSTON, Jamaica (AP) _ A spelling-bee coach, a soccer player
and well-known newspaper publisher were among 88 Jamaicans awarded
government honors Thursday, the country's Independence Day.
	   The government awarded the nation's fourth highest honor, The
Order of Jamaica, to Oliver F. Clarke, 54, publisher of the
164-year-old Gleaner newspaper and president of the Inter-American
Press Association.
	   John Issa, 59, chairman of SuperClubs Resorts Ltd., and Vin
Lawrence, 53, chairman of the Urban Development Corporation,
received the same honor.
	   The government also named 21 people Commander Class Officers of
the Order of Distinction. They included Dr. Matthew Beaubrun,
Jamaica's ambassador to Venezuela; police commissioner Francis
Forbes; and Horace Burrell, the president of the Jamaica Football
Federation who guided Jamaica's soccer team to its first berth in
the World Cup competition this year. Jamaica ended the competition
22nd out of 32 teams.
	   The team's Brazilian coach, Rene Simoes, was given the same
award ``for distinctive service to the development of football,''
the government announced.
	   Rev. Glen Archer, who coached 12-year-old Jody-Anne Maxwell to
her win in the Scripps Howard Spelling Bee Championship earlier
this year, headed the list of 29 people awarded the Officer Class
Order of Distinction.
	   Warren Barrett, captain of the national football team, received
the same honor.
	   The honorees will be presented with their awards on National
Heroes Day, October 20.

Chamblee, Lewis lead by stroke in Buick Open
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By HARRY ATKINS &QC; 
 &UR; AP Sports Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   GRAND BLANC, Michigan (AP) _ J.L Lewis and Brandel Chamblee,
each seeking their first victory on the PGA Tour, shot 7-under-par
65s and were one stroke ahead of three others in the first round of
the Buick Open on Thursday.
	   Defending champion Vijay Singh, Dudley Hart and Gary Hallberg
shot 66s over the rain-softened Warwick Hills Golf and Country Club
course.
	   Heavy overnight storms delayed the start of the morning round by
about 30 minutes. Rain softened the ground so much that players
were allowed to lift, clean and replace balls hit in the fairway.
	   Chris Perry, Scott McCarron, Clarence Rose, Phil Blackmar, J.P.
Hayes, Kent Jones and Bob Tway shot 67s, two strokes off the pace.
	   Tiger Woods, who thought the user-friendly track at Warwick
Hills would be the perfect tuneup for the PGA Championship next
week at Redmond, Washington missed some putts and played the par-5s
at even par. That doomed him to a 71 and might force him to
scramble just to make the cut.
	   Woods, who finished third three weeks ago in the British Open,
had four birdies and three bogeys over the 7,105-yard (6,466-meter)
course.
	   ``I wasted some shots out there today,'' Woods said.
``Hopefully, it will be better tomorrow. The great thing is there
are still 54 holes to play.''
	   Lewis, who spent last season on the Nike Tour, got rolling with
birdies on the first two holes. He also put together a string of
three straight birdies on the back. His only bogey came when he
drove into some trees bordering the 10th fairway.
	   ``I have a balanced game,'' said Lewis, who has missed 13 cuts
in 21 tournaments this season. ``My biggest weakness is fairways
hit.''
	   Or missed.
	   Fast starts are nothing new for Lewis. Three years ago, he shot
64 in the first round at New Orleans. Finishing has been a bigger
problem.
	   ``You learn from experience,'' said Lewis, whose best finish
this season was a tie for sixth in the Buick Invitational in
February. ``The key for me this week will be hitting fairways.''
	   Chamblee had a bogey-free round that included three putts of 20
feet (6 meters). But he also took advantage of the soft greens.
	   ``The greens were so soft, I was backing up 4-irons today,''
said Chamblee, who missed the cut in his first three Buick Opens,
then quit coming after 1992.
	   His 4-iron onto the par-3 third hit four feet behind the hole,
then spun back to within one foot (0.3 meters) of the cup.
	   Singh, who tied for 19th in his last start three weeks ago in
the British Open, figured he might be onto something good when he
hit a sand wedge to within an inch of the cup at the first hole.
	   ``That was a good start,'' Singh said, laughing. ``When you are
defending, you like to get going. Birdie on the first hole is a
good boost.''
	   Hart, who had rounds of 74 and 73 while tying for 43rd last week
at Memphis, played a bogey-free round this time.
	   ``It was really soft,'' Hart said. ``The greens are so soft now,
the ball spins so much you find yourself taking more club, trying
to take spin off the ball.''
	   Woods wasn't the only well-known golfer to struggle.
	   Justin Leonard, seeking his first victory since The Players
Championship in March, shot 73.
	   ``I'm just not playing good,'' Leonard said. ``I'm hitting the
ball fine, but I'm not doing the things necessary to score. It's
disappointing. I don't have any answers.''
	   Brian Watts, who emerged onto the world golf scene by finishing
second to Mark O'Meara in the British Open, shot 71, same as Curtis
Strange.
	   Jeff Sluman and Paul Stankowski shot 68s.

Olympics officials target ambush marketers
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By MATTHEW BROWN &QC;

<TEXT>
	   SALT LAKE CITY (AP) _ Guardians of the 2002 Winter Olympics
trademarks have launched a campaign warning businesses that use of
the familiar rings or other logos won't be tolerated.
	   The announcement Thursday by a senior United States Olympic
Committee official comes amid a standoff with a local brewery that
has called itself the ``unofficial beer'' of the 2002 Games.
	   While Wasatch Brewery is hardly a competitive threat to official
beer sponsor Anheuser-Busch, Olympic sponsors aren't amused by the
local company's cavalier attitude toward what they say is illegal.
	   ``It's cheating, pure and simple,'' USOC deputy secretary
general John Krimsky said.
	   Krimsky, who also heads the USOC's marketing arm, said he is
launching a campaign to educate Utah consumers and businesses about
``ambush'' marketing by companies that want to profit off the
Olympics without helping finance the billion-dollar event.
	   Those companies violate federal and local trademark and
licensing laws and dilute the value of an Olympic sponsorship, he
said. Anheuser-Busch paid more than dlrs 50 million to sponsor the
Olympics.
	   Krimsky said it is his job to protect that investment, 70
percent of which goes to fund the Olympics and support the
athletes.
	   While Krimsky said ambush marketing schemes become more
sophisticated every Olympics, the sole agitator to surface so far
for 2002 is Wasatch Brewery.
	   Olympics organizers are attempting to stop the brewery's owner,
Schirf Brewing Co., from displaying the phrase ``Wasatch Beers. The
Unofficial Beer, 2002 Winter Games'' on one of its trucks.
	   Schirf has been warned by Salt Lake Organizing Committee lawyers
that ``all commercial uses of words relating to the Olympic Games,
including indirect references,'' belong to the USOC and must be
removed.
	   Brewery owner and founder Greg Schirf said he isn't budging.
	   He said the Olympics organizers are taking themselves too
seriously by claiming ownership of the words ``Games'' and
``2002.''
	   ``Our contention is we were careful not to use the word
Olympics,'' Schirf said. ``No one has claim on 2002 and everyone
uses the word games.''
	   Schirf is pushing the controversy a step further by marketing a
beer labeled ``Wasatch Unofficial 2002 Amber Ale.''
	   The USOC hopes to enlist the public in its fight with print
advertisements that ask readers, ``How do you feel about cheating
in the Olympic Games?''
	   The ads are designed so the name of a company can be inserted
along with a telephone number readers can call to express their
displeasure.
	   Schirf claims he already has the public backing him.
	   He said the delivery truck branded with the slogan elicits honks
and waves, while the company offices continue to receive e-mail and
phone calls encouraging them not to back down.
	   Schirf doesn't know how long he can continue to afford to fight
Olympic organizers. But he revealed what could make him cave in to
organizers.
	   ``We don't want to make a deal. We just want to have some fun,''
he said. ``The only way we will acquiesce is if they make us drink
Budweiser.''

	   KINGSTON, Jamaica (AP) _ A spelling bee coach, a soccer player
and well-known newspaper publisher were among 88 Jamaicans awarded
government honors Thursday, the country's Independence Day.
	   The government awarded the nation's fourth highest honor, The
Order of Jamaica, to Oliver F. Clarke, 54, publisher of the
164-year-old Gleaner newspaper and president of the Inter-American
Press Association.
	   John Issa, 59, chairman of SuperClubs Resorts Ltd., and Vin
Lawrence, 53, chairman of the Urban Development Corporation,
received the same honor.
	   The government also named 21 people Commander Class Officers of
the Order of Distinction. They included Dr. Matthew Beaubrun,
Jamaica's ambassador to Venezuela; police commissioner Francis
Forbes; and Horace Burrell, the president of the Jamaica Football
Federation who guided Jamaica's soccer team to its first berth in
the World Cup competition this year. Jamaica ended the competition
22nd out of 32 teams.
	   The team's Brazilian coach, Rene Simoes, was given the same
award ``for distinctive service to the development of football,''
the government announced.
	   Rev. Glen Archer, who coached 12-year-old Jody-Anne Maxwell to
her win in the Scripps Howard Spelling Bee Championship earlier
this year, headed the list of 29 people awarded the Officer Class
Order of Distinction.
	   Warren Barrett, captain of the national soccer team, received
the same honor.
	   The honorees will be presented with their awards on National
Heroes Day, October 20.

 &UR; Tensions rise after Peru protests Ecuadorean border incursion &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   LIMA, Peru (AP) _ Foreign Minister Eduardo Ferrero on Thursday
charged that Ecuadorean troops had infiltrated a remote stretch of
Peru's Andean foothills where the two countries fought a brief war
in early 1995.
	   News of the alleged incursion, which Ferrero called a
``provocation,'' caused President Alberto Fujimori to cancel a
planned trip to Colombia on Thursday to try to defuse the rising
tensions.
	   ``The president has canceled his trip, because he has decided it
is necessary to stay in the country until the situation is
clarified,'' Ferrero told a news conference.
	   Ferrero would only say that the incursion took place ``in the
last few weeks,'' when the Ecuadorean troops reached 12 miles (20
kilometers) inside Peruvian territory in the disputed Cordillera
del Condor region, 560 miles (900 kms) north of Lima.
	   There were no reports of clashes with Peruvian troops. He did
not say how many troops were involved.
	   Ecuador's military representative on an international mission
monitoring the disputed region, Gen. Carlos Calle, said Peru's
charge was ``completely false.''
	   The Andean neighbors regularly swap charges that the others'
troops had infiltrated their territory.
	   But this charge came as the two countries appeared set to
negotiate an end to a long-running dispute over 49 miles (78
kilometers) of unmarked border that had erupted in wars in 1941,
1981 and 1995.
	   Fujimori had said that the negotiations, which began after the
1995 conflict, were ``practically concluded.''
	   But tensions started growing on July 28 when two Peruvian
soldiers were injured when they stepped on land mines in the
disputed area amid a largely uninhabited wilderness.
	   Peru accused Ecuador of planting the mines and Ecuador accused
Peru of carrying out a troop build up in the region.

Athletic board mum after meeting on Tyson
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: NEW with Thursday's developments &QL; 
 &UR; By WENDY RUDERMAN &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   TRENTON, New Jersey (AP) _ Members of the state Athletic Control
Board refused to say Thursday when they'll make a decision on
whether to award a boxing license to Mike Tyson.
	   After emerging from a three-hour private session at the Richard
J. Hughes Justice Complex, boxing commissioner Larry Hazzard
offered ``no comment'' several times to questions regarding a
decision.
	   Tyson, 32, hasn't fought since June 1997, when he bit the ears
of WBA heavyweight champion Evander Holyfield during a bout in Las
Vegas. Nevada regulators revoked his boxing license and said he
could reapply after one year.
	   Tyson opted to apply for a license in New Jersey instead.
	   Hazzard, board chairman Gerald Gormley and board member Gary
Shaw reviewed Tyson's application and deliberated during the 10
a.m. to 1 p.m. closed-door meeting, said Paul Loriquet, spokesman
for the attorney general's office.
	   The three also reviewed written testimony from the public for
and against Tyson and sought legal advice from assistant attorney
general Michael Haas, who participated in the executive session.
	   During a hearing before regulators last week, Tyson lost his
temper and cursed after being grilled by state lawyers about the
Holyfield incident. But his lawyer, his wife and other supporters
told the board that Tyson was remorseful for biting Holyfield and
that he wants to return to boxing.
	   Board members have little more than a month to render a decision
but could make one earlier. They must give the public two days
notice before voting.
	   Board member Steven Katz, who was not present at the July 29
hearing or Thursday's session, isn't participating in the
deliberations, and Hazzard is not a voting member of the board.
	   However, it's possible Katz would provide the tiebreaking vote
if Gormley and Shaw deadlock on whether to grant Tyson a license,
Loriquet said.
	   Critics say Tyson's outburst during the hearing proves he has
problems with self-control. Citing Tyson's 1992 rape conviction in
Indiana, members of the New Jersey chapter of the National
Organization for Women say allowing Tyson to box again in New
Jersey would be ``an insult to women.''
	   However, Mark Juliano, president and CEO of Caesars Atlantic
City, said Thursday that awarding Tyson a license could have a
tremendous financial impact on Atlantic City.
	   ``It would probably depend on who he fought but generally a
heavyweight championship fight is the biggest draw that we do,''
Juliano said.

	   A summary of financial and business news from The Associated
Press at 0000 GMT. Stories carry ``f'' or ``i'' category codes and
move on this circuit in expanded form:
	   NEW YORK (AP) _ Technology shares mounted a sharp rebound
Thursday, but most stocks rose only modestly, offering few clues as
to whether the volatile decline of recent weeks has bottomed. The
Dow Jones industrial average rose 30.90 points _ or 0.3 percent _
to 8,577.68 after another session of twists and turns, albeit far
more tame than those seen in recent days. (US-CLOSING STOCKS)
	   WASHINGTON (AP) _ Held back by production slumps in aircraft and
automobiles, orders to U.S. factories inched only 0.1 percent
higher in June, failing to recover from a sharp decline the month
before. Orders totaled a seasonally adjusted dlrs 330.5 billion,
the Commerce Department said Thursday. In May, they had fallen 2.2
percent _ the biggest drop in three years _ to a seasonally
adjusted dlrs 330.2 billion. Orders in the April-June quarter were
0.7 percent below the first quarter. Economists said that reflects
spillover from Asia's economic turmoil. Export sales to Asia have
plummeted. Meanwhile, U.S. manufacturers face increased competition
from Asian imports, priced cheaply because of currency devaluations
over the past year. (US-ECONOMY)
	   AMSTERDAM, Netherlands (AP) _ Hit by low oil prices and Asia's
economic crisis, the Royal Dutch Shell Group of Cos. on Thursday
said its net income fell 17 percent to dlrs 1.6 billion in the
second quarter. Earnings for the three months ended June 30 were at
the lower end of the dlrs 1.6 billion to dlrs 1.8 billion range
forecast by analysts. In the same period a year ago, the
Anglo-Dutch giant posted a profit of dlrs 1.9 billion. Shares of
Shell, one of the world's biggest energy companies, were trading
down 8.4 percent by midafternoon Thursday on the London Stock
Exchange. (EARNS-ROYAL DUTCH SHELL)
	   FRANKFURT, Germany (AP) _ With September elections likely to
turn on the state of the economy, Chancellor Helmut Kohl's
government on Thursday welcomed a report projecting an economic
upswing and new jobless figures indicating a favorable shift in the
employment market. The Organization for Economic Cooperation and
Development forecast growth of 2.75 percent in 1998 and 3 percent
in 1999, in line with the German government's forecasts. ``The
report shows that Germany's economic and fiscal policy is on the
right track,'' Finance Minister Theo Waigel said in a statement.
(GERMANY-UNEMPLOYMENT)
	   WASHINGTON (AP) _ A group of liberal Democrats said Thursday
that opposition in Congress was mounting to provide the
International Monetary Fund with dlrs 18 billion to replenish its
dwindling reserves. Standing on the lawn outside the Capitol
building, they punctured a green, dinosaur-shaped pinata, saying
this symbolized the need to crack open the wall of secrecy
surrounding the IMF. ``Past experience has shown us that the IMF
can only be reformed by withholding money so we are advocating
(doing this) until reforms are enacted,'' said Rep. George Miller.
He and some other lawmakers want the 182-nation organization to
explain its operations more clearly and stop making loans they say
are used to rescue big international banks that made bad
investments. (US-IMF)
	   STUTTGART, Germany (AP) _ Daimler-Benz estimated Thursday that
its merger with U.S. automaker Chrysler will save the two companies
5.4 billion marks (dlrs 3.1 billion) over three to five years. The
savings are expected primarily from the pooling of technology and
know-how, Daimler said in a news release summarizing a
comprehensive merger report. The figure compares to the rough
estimate of 5 billion marks (dlrs 2.8 billion) given by the
companies when they announced in May they would merge to create the
world's third-largest automaker. The deal, planned for November or
December, has been valued at about dlrs 38 billion.
(GERMANY-DAIMLER-CHRYSLER, US-DAIMLER-CHRYSLER)
	   WASHINGTON (AP) _ Seeking a balance between oil development and
the environment, the U.S. government announced Thursday it will
open nearly 4 million acres (1.6 million hectares) of a federal
reserve on Alaska's North Slope to oil development. Interior
Secretary Bruce Babbitt said that a portion of the most
ecologically sensitive part of the reserve would be off limits to
drilling, including a strip of coastal marshland that
environmentalists consider critical for millions of migratory birds
and other wild life. A number of oil companies, including Arco
Alaska and British Petroleum, have expressed intense interest in
drilling in the government reserve just west of the Prudhoe Bay oil
fields. (US-ALASKA OIL)

	   A summary of late news from The Associated Press. Some items
have moved on this circuit in expanded form with ``i'' or ``f''
category codes:
	   WASHINGTON (AP) _ In long-awaited testimony that could alter the
course of Bill Clinton's presidency, former White House intern
Monica Lewinsky spent several hours Thursday telling a grand jury
her account of relationship with the president. Sources said she
would describe sexual encounters with the president inside the
White House. Eight hours earlier, she had been whisked into the
courthouse through a side door, avoiding a crowd of more than a
hundred journalists that had gathered overnight for Thursday's
dramatic events. Ms. Lewinsky is testifying before a grand jury
investigating allegations that Clinton had an affair with Lewinsky
then lied about it under oath. Also being investigated is whether
Clinton urged others to lie under oath. (US-CLINTON-INVESTIGATION)
	   BAGHDAD, Iraq (AP) _ Making good on its threat to limit arms
inspections, Iraq Thursday banned surprise checks by the U.N.
nuclear agency and told weapons inspectors they can only monitor
sites already checked. The moves follow President Saddam Hussein's
decision Wednesday to freeze cooperation with U.N. weapons
inspectors and the International Atomic Energy Agency. The
development threatens to renew a dispute that nearly started a war
six months ago with the United States and Britain. (IRAQ)
	   BEIJING (AP) _ China's government said Thursday it was
considering the last-ditch step of breaking open dikes along the
raging Yangtze River to protect areas downstream, as the death toll
from the devastating summer flood season passed 2,000. The decision
on whether to safeguard some areas by inundating others could come
as early as Friday, when a flood tide surging down the river
approaches a major embankment already weakened by weeks of floods
and rain, officials said. (CHINA-FLOODS)
	   KINSHASA, Congo (AP) _ Rwandan soldiers and Tutsi rebels were
advancing Thursday across this vast African nation in a scene
eerily reminiscent of Congo President Laurent Kabila's own march to
power last year. As the conflict widened, Kabila's government
threatened war against neighboring Rwanda, which it accused of
masterminding the uprising. ``The war will be long and popular,
that is, the whole people of Congo will defend their nation and
sovereignty,'' said Kabila, who wore a pair of green army fatigues
Thursday while addressing government officials clad in military
uniforms. (CONGO)
	   WASHINGTON (AP) _ The World Bank approved a dlrs 1.5 billion
loan to Russia on Thursday to help the financially-troubled nation
move more rapidly to restructure its economy. The loan is part of a
dlrs 22.6 billion emergency rescue package that the International
Monetary Fund, the bank and the Japanese government negotiated with
Russia last month. The bank loan, the largest it has ever made in
Europe and Central Asia, will be paid in installments, with amounts
going up as Russia meets a series of increasingly difficult
economic benchmarks reforms, bank officials said. (WORLD

	   LIVERPOOL, England (AP) _ Photographs of rock icons and family
snapshots taken by the late wife of Paul McCartney are being
exhibited in McCartney's hometown.
	   A shot of McCartney with the couple's then-baby daughter, Mary,
tucked in his jacket to keep warm is one of the 14 pictures.
	   In another, Linda McCartney photographed her husband's feet,
complete with painted toenails, holding a glass.
	   Mrs. McCartney's photographs have never before been shown in
Liverpool, although she gave the prints in question _ part of a
collection of 150 photographs published in 1976 _ to the city's
Walker Art Gallery in 1978.
	   The exhibit, which runs from Friday until Sept. 6, also includes
photographs of rock stars David Bowie and Jimi Hendrix.

	   BRISBANE, Australia (AP) _ A legal battle over the estate of
rock star Michael Hutchence has begun behind closed doors in the
Queensland Supreme Court.
	   The late INXS lead singer's mother and sister are at loggerheads
with the estate's Hong Kong-based executor, Andrew Morrison Paul,
over the ownership of assets held in trust.
	   Officially, Hutchence died almost penniless when he committed
suicide in his Sydney hotel room last November.
	   But tens of millions of dollars worth of property, shares, bank
accounts and income from his music is held in trust in tax havens.
	   Hutchence's mother Patricia Glassop and sister Christina
Hutchence have launched action against the executors of his estate
_ the architects of the trusts _ arguing the assets should be
included in his estate and divided according to his will.
	   An emotional Mrs. Glassop would only say ``It's for my son that
I'm doing this,'' when she left the court Wednesday.
	    &UR; ___ &QC; 
	   BEIRUT, Lebanon (AP) _ American jazz singer Nina Simone blamed
racism in the United States for her decision to live abroad for the
past 25 years.
	   Speaking on Thursday, a day after arriving in Lebanon to sing at
an annual festival, Simone said that as a black person, ``I have
paid a heavy price fighting the establishment.''
	   She did not elaborate, but said that racial inequality in the
United States was now ``worse than ever.''
	   ``I have not lived in America for 25 years ... because of the
racism.''
	   Simone, 65, began her career in the early fifties. She took part
in the civil rights' movement of the sixties and dedicated several
songs to the cause of racial equality.
	   She left the United States in 1973 and lived in the Caribbean
and Africa until settling in Europe.
	   Simone will perform this weekend at the Baalbek International
Festival in eastern Lebanon.
	    &UR; ___ &QC; 
	   TUCSON, Arizona (AP) _ A homeless man who admitted to an
attempted stalking charge after trying to contact singer Linda
Ronstadt says his only crime was not knowing how to approach her.
	   ``Linda Ronstadt has touched my heart, soothed my soul and
occupied part of my mind for twenty-and-some years,'' Bernard A.
Ortiz wrote to the judge who sentenced him Wednesday to 10 months
in prison.
	   Ortiz, a schizophrenic, was sentenced to three years' probation
in June after pleading guilty to attempted stalking.
	   But he violated terms of the deal three weeks later when he sent
a package to Miss Ronstadt's relatives, saying it was for her
birthday. Deputy County Attorney Dan Nicolini said the gift package
contained a watch, birthday candles and a letter.

	   CARACAS, Venezuela (AP) _ If you want to protest against
something in Caracas, you'd better have your clothes on, the city's
police chief said Thursday.
	   General Francisco Belisario said a demonstration earlier this
week by about a dozen nude university students protesting higher
school fees was an assault ``on public decency.''
	   Those who go nude in public will be jailed for up to one month,
he assured.
	   But General Belisario's boss, Interior Minister Asdrubal Aguiar,
doesn't see anything wrong with showing a little flesh.
	   ``They'd have to throw all the British people in jail who strip
in the stadiums,'' Aguiar told The Associated Press, referring to
the British practice of streaking during soccer matches.
	   ___
	   SANTIAGO, Chile (AP) - A Bolivian woman who swallowed several
rubber packages of cocaine to smuggle it into Chile died when some
of the packages broke, police reported Thursday.
	   Police said 36-year-old Amelia Nita had swallowed the cocaine
wrapped in small doses in fingers cut from surgical gloves.
	   The woman felt bad at the airport two days ago and was rushed to
a hospital where she died, police said. The cocaine was found in
her stomach during an autopsy.
	   ___
	   HAVANA, Cuba (AP) _ A bus accident in western Cuba killed 24
people and injured at least two others seriously injured, state
radio reported Thursday.
	   The accident occurred Wednesday evening on the road between
Bahia Honda and San Cristobal, about 60 kms (35 miles) west of
Havana, state Radio Havana Cuba said.
	   Details on the cause of the accident were not available.
	   ___
	   PANAMA CITY (AP) _ A referendum on whether to allow Panama's
president to seek re-election is expected to draw 86 percent of
eligible voters, a poll published Thursday said.
	   The survey of 1,200 people on Aug. 1-2 had a margin of error of
3 percentage points.
	   Political groups and the Catholic church have urged Panamanians
to turn out for the referendum on proposed constitutional reforms,
including an amendment on re-election.
	   The party of President Ernesto Perez Balladares says his
re-election would help the country continue economic reforms.
	   Whoever wins the 1999 race will oversee the U.S. handover of the
Panama Canal, along with some of the country's most valuable land.
	   A recent survey showed the proposal was opposed by 49 percent of
Panamanians and favored by 33 percent.
	   ___
	   MEXICO CITY (AP) _ A 13-year-old boy who was about to be lynched
by a crowd for allegedly killing an 11-year-old friend was rescued
by police and taken into custody, a newspaper reported Thursday.
	   Neighbors of the slain boy, Carlos Armando Villegas, had gone to
the suspect's home to lynch him Wednesday when they were stopped by
authorities in Mante, a city in Tamaulipas state, the daily Reforma
said.
	   The victim disappeared on July 29 and his body turned up two
days later in a cardboard box in a trash heap. Police said the
suspect, Erick Gonzalez, had been seen carrying the box and blood
stains were found in his house.
	   ___
	   SAO PAULO, Brazil (AP) _ A former police officer who last year
was filmed beating and shooting motorists here has been sentenced
to a 44-month prison sentence.
	   A military court sentenced Otavio Lourenco Gambra - nicknamed
Rambo - late Wednesday night at the end of a 12-hour-long trial. He
was charged with with abuse of authority and infliction of bodily
harm.
	   In March 1997, the nation was shocked by images showing Gambra
and seven other police officers torturing and extorting money from
motorists at a roadblock.
	   At one point Gambra was shown firing at a car, killing mechanic
Mario Hose Josinho. The video was shot by an amateur cameraman.
	   The seven other officers were sentenced last month to prison
terms ranging from 18 to 45 months for the same charges levied
against Gambra.
	   All eight are scheduled to be tried by a civilian court in
September on charges of murder and attempted murder.
	   ___
	   LA PAZ, Bolivia (AP) _ In a speech marking his first year in
office, President Hugo Banzer said Thursday he had strengthened the
judicial system and that he would now give priority to the war on
drugs.
	   Banzer called attention to the introduction special courts to
oversee and monitor other courts, widely considered corrupt.
	   Banzer insisted that in the coming year he would destroy all
coca plants that feed the cocaine industry.
	   His government has destroyed 5,000 hectares (12,300 acres) of
illegal coca fields during the first seven months of the year. This
represents 15 percent of the country's coca leaf production
destined for drug production.
	   ___
	   GUATEMALA CITY (AP) _ A Guatemalan man said Thursday he will
fight extradition to the United States, where he is wanted in
connection with a 1994 murder in California.
	   Rene Macario Moscoso is accused of killing a fellow Guatemalan,
Alberto Alvarez, in November 1994 in an Oakland, Calif.,
restaurant.
	   Moscoso maintains his innocence, asserting that he has never
been in Oakland or met Alvarez.

strategy would be ahead of a news conference at his Dublin office
Friday. In April at the same venue Smith proclaimed her innocence
and vowed to fight any suggestions she ever used
performance-enhancing drugs.
	   Thursday's judgment by the international swimming federation
FINA said Smith had ``manipulated'' a urine sample taken Jan. 10 at
her home in Kilkenny, southeast Ireland, most likely by spiking it
with whiskey.
	   It barred Smith for four years, making her ineligible for the
2000 Sydney Olympics and the 2001 world championships in Fukuoka,
Japan _ and 32 years old before she could compete again.
	   After Smith testified before FINA's anti-doping panel July 24
Lennon said that if she was found guilty they would appeal to a
higher authority, such as the Swiss-based Court of Arbitration for
Sport.
	   ``Michelle is determined to fight it through,'' the swimmer's
sister Aisling told Irish broadcasters RTE Thursday.
	   But the FINA judgment emphasized that two vials of the tainted
urine sample, stored and tested separately, had exhibited the same
high-alcohol content. This, it said, ruled out the possibility that
anyone other than Smith had tampered with the samples during
transportation or in the laboratory in Barcelona, Spain.
	   The swimmer has faced a skeptical world ever since she defied
conventional wisdom and her own previous mediocre record to win
three gold medals and a bronze at the 1996 Atlanta Olympics. While
fans said it demonstrated a triumph of will against the odds, her
detractors alleged the feat must have been aided by illegal
substances.
	   Smith's devoted circle in her native Rathcoole, west of Dublin,
has remained loyal to the woman lauded in local posters as ``our
belle Michelle.''
	   But the articulate, confident redhead has never been able to
translate her Olympic feats into commercial success even in her
native land, where less successful sports stars are national
heroes.
	   Hours before her ban was announced Smith appeared at the Dublin
Horse Show as a celebrity guest on Ireland's Gaelic-language
television channel, a fringe outlet in predominantly
English-speaking Ireland.
	   Since Atlanta the entire foundation of swimming in Ireland has
been tainted by other scandals. Smith's former coach, Derry
O'Rourke, was convicted last year of sexually abusing more than
dozen girls under his direction, though Smith says he never abused
her.
	   A second coach fled to the United States after evading similar
sex-abuse charges. A third coach was convicted of murdering his
wife and niece after fathering a child to another teen-age swimmer.
	   Smith's decision to dump O'Rourke as coach in 1993 proved
pivotal to her career.
	   Her new coach, Dutch discus thrower Erik de Bruin, was then
serving his own four-year ban from competition after testing
positive for excessive testosterone. She married de Bruin and today
credits his coaching methods for her success, though she has vowed
not to reveal what those methods are until she retires.

Rio policeman cited for bravery after controversial shooting
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   RIO DE JANEIRO, Brazil _ A police man who shot two alleged
robbers at point blank range will get a bonus for bravery,
authorities said Thursday.
	   The shooting, which occurred in the upscale Ipanema district on
Wednesday morning, was captured on video tape.
	   In the video, police Cpt. Sidnei Teodoro is seen approaching two
men sitting on a motorcycle with his gun drawn and begins searching
one of the men.
	   At that point, the man being searched apparently reached for a
gun and Teodoro discharged six shots in 2.5 seconds killing both
men.
	   ``The man managed to draw his gun, but I was faster. If I hadn't
shot them I would have been the dead one,'' Cpt. Teodoro told
reporters.
	   According to Teodoro, he had been tipped off that the two man
had been involved in a bank robbery.
	   Rio de Janeiro police have accepted Teodoro's version of events
and want to decorate him for bravery, said a police spokesman who
declined to identify himself. It was not immediately clear how much
money the bonus involved.
	   Federal Police have, however, opened an investigation into the
case.
	   ``At the very least, the policeman approached in a less than
ideal fashion,'' said James Cavalaro director of Human Rights Watch
in Brazil. ``Once he was in the awkward position of holding a gun
to one of the suspects heads and leaning over trying to search him,
that creates conditions where there was a reason to shot. Maybe
once, not six times.''
	   Cavalaro also complained about the bravery bonus, which human
rights groups here say rewards police who kill suspects rather than
arresting them.

China tries to control information on flooding
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; With China-Floods &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   JIAYU, China (AP) _ While soldiers shore up dikes along the
swollen Yangtze River, other officials are busy trying to ensure
the world hears only the official version about widespread, deadly
flooding in central China.
	   Security officials have tightened enforcement of restrictions on
independent information from flood areas.
	   Requests by foreign reporters to go to flood areas in at least
three provinces have been rejected. Reporters who try to visit
anyway have been detained under Chinese rules requiring official
permission for them to work outside cities where they are assigned.
	   An accurate picture of the extent of damage or the death toll is
nearly impossible. The main source of information is the state
media, which supplies reports that appear to be late and
incomplete.
	   The death toll, which officially has surpassed 2,000, is
impossible to verify independently.
	   State television shows dramatic footage almost nightly of heroic
efforts to shore up a dike or evacuate a flooded town. But it gives
no indication of when the events occurred or the extent of the
damage.
	   A farmer who gave only his surname, Cong, told Associated Press
Television on Wednesday that, ``we haven't seen anything about this
area on television.'' The sudden collapse Saturday of Yangtze River
levees in Jiayu flooded homes and swept away an unknown number of
people.
	   In the central city of Wuhan, reporters who visited a week after
flooding was reported there found that parts of the city had been
underwater for nearly a month. For more than two weeks, state media
had delayed reporting about flooding in the industrial center with
a population of 3 million people.
	   In a step away from their usual secrecy, Chinese officials held
a press conference Thursday and disclosed that they were
considering dynamiting dikes upstream from Wuhan, draining the
Yangtze River into farmland to protect property downstream.
	   The complexity of constraints on information has left some
officials confused about what is still secret. A senior police
officer in Jiayu who asked why reporters wanted to go to flooded
Paizhou expressed surprise that state media, including the
English-language China Daily newspaper, had disclosed that the dike
collapse there.

US will have to work; Yugoslavia looks good
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: RECAPS previous; first quarterfinal starts at 1215 GMT &QL; 
 &UR; By HOWARD FENDRICH &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   ATHENS, Greece (AP) _ The U.S. team at the World Basketball
Championship is still very much a work-in-progress.
	   Heading into its quarterfinal against Italy, the anonymous
collection of players cobbled together a month ago and drawn mainly
from the CBA and European leagues knew grabbing the gold would not
be easy.
	   ``Right now, we've sort of been scrambling through,'' said
Wendell Alexis, a forward who plays in Germany. ``We need to be
more consistent in recognizing other teams' strengths and
weaknesses, what their players' roles are. Who's a shooter, who's a
driver.''
	   Familiarity should not be a problem against Italy, which the
Americans beat 80-75 in a July 25 exhibition game at Rome.
	   Friday's other quarterfinal matchups were: Yugoslavia vs.
Argentina, Greece vs. Spain, and Russia vs. Lithuania.
	   Like the other starless teams in Athens, Italy is inconsistent.
It upset Yugoslavia but barely scratched out a win over Senegal.
	   The runners-up at the 1997 European championship rely mainly on
British-born point guard Carlton Myers' instant offense _ he scored
29 points in Rome _ and Slovenian-born center Gregor Fucka's inside
play.
	   ``Honestly, I think the key for us is playing good individual
and team defense,'' said guard Jimmy Oliver, who has switched teams
nine times, playing in the NBA, CBA and Spanish League, since
leaving Purdue in 1991. ``If we don't, it will be a rough night.''
	   Oliver, Alexis and small forward Jason Sasser have been coach
Rudy Tomjanovich's prime weapons so far, with Michael Hawkins
on-and-off at the point.
	   The United States has been hindered by slow starts in almost
every game here, and had to avoid that Friday.
	   ``We have discussed establishing ourselves early. If we
concentrate and play a good first half,'' said Jimmy King, a
Michigan Fab Fiver now playing in the CBA, ``and don't have to
worry about digging ourselves out of a hole, we'll be OK.''
	   Hawkins needed to avoid another 0-for-4 shooting night like he
had against Australia Tuesday, and make Myers work on defense, for
the United States to advance.
	   The other top seed heading into the quarters, Yugoslavia, had an
easier task. Argentina lost three straight round-robin games before
beating Brazil to reach the final eight.
	   Yugoslavia's _ and perhaps the event's _ best player has been
Zeljko Rebraca, a 2.11-meter (6-foot-11) center who can do a little
bit of everything. He averaged 12.2 points, 8.5 rebounds and a
tournament-high 3.5 blocks per game in the preliminary rounds.

Peru's enigmatic Nazca Lines trampled by tourists, neglect

<TEXT>
	   NAZCA, Peru (AP) _ The U.S. tourists drove their van across this
bleak desert plain in southern Peru, their tire tracks scarring the
fragile, ancient designs etched into the moonlike landscape. Their
marks will remain for centuries.
	   Careless tourists are not the only threat to the Nazca Lines.
Trucks rumble across them. At night, looters dig in search of
Indian graves, miners look for gold and city trucks dump garbage on
the desert.
	   With the recent death of the woman who defended the Nazca Lines
for 50 years, archaeologists warn the huge desert etchings are in
danger of disappearing in coming decades.
	   The site is made up of thousands of lines, some stretching for
miles and climbing distant hills. Dozens of figures are etched
among them: a hummingbird, monkey, whale, spider and flower. The
figures, some up to 900 feet (275 meters) long, are recognizable
only from the air.
	   Called everything from an ancient calendar to an alien landing
strip, the lines are etched into one of the world's driest deserts,
280 miles (450 kilometers) southeast of Lima.
	   Nights are bitterly cold and days scorchingly hot on the eerily
lifeless plains of Nazca in southern Peru.
	   Italian archaeologist Giuseppe Orefici, who has worked in Nazca
for 17 years, calls the desert etchings the world's largest
hieroglyphics, created 1,000 to 2,000 years ago when the Nazca and
Paracas cultures cleared the stony surface and exposed the whitish
soil underneath.
	   They are a book written in a strange language that has been
preserved by the extreme desert conditions, he said.
	   It is Peru's great novel, written in disappearing ink.
	   The tourists from California who crisscrossed their van across
the Nazca Lines left July 23 after dumping fruit peel and eggs
shells.
	   What they did ``was a minor sacrilege of one of the world's
archaeological treasures,'' Orefici said. ``But it was one of many
sacrileges. The Nazca Lines are suffering an absurd neglect.''
	   The government has budgeted dlrs 10,000 to protect the site for
the rest of the year. It receives no other funding.
	   The money pays for two guards on motorcycles to patrol the 200
square miles (518 square kilometers) of desert where the lines are
etched. At night, the guards go home, leaving them unprotected.
	   Centuries of neglect have destroyed about a fifth of the
original etchings, Nazca historian Andres Lancho said.
	   Many of the figures are already crisscrossed by tire tracks. The
busy Pan American Highway, built in the early 1940s, slices
hundreds of lines and cuts a drawing of a giant lizard in two.
	   In May, their protector, German mathematician Maria Reiche, died
of cancer at the age of 95. Before her death, Reiche paid for the
guards herself.
	   For 50 years she fought off threats to the lines, including
plans to hold a motorcycle race and to irrigate the desert for
farming.
	   ``Her death has put a big question mark beside the future of the
Nazca Lines because who will fight for them like she did?'' Lancho
said.
	   The site has baffled archaeologists, who wonder how ancient
cultures constructed such straight lines and precise figures
visible only from the air without modern tools or airplanes.
	   Reiche believed the designs represented a giant calendar based
on the movements of constellations. She theorized they told ancient
desert dwellers when to plant and irrigate their crops and were
made using ropes, stakes and mathematics.
	   A more controversial theory was put forward in the 1970s, when a
best-selling book suggested they were an alien landing strip.
	   Nazca became an attraction for mystics who believe it holds
special magnetic powers. Others came to wait for space ships to
return to earth.
	   To this day, tourists try to camp on the lines to absorb their
reputed energy, Garcia says.
	   Before her death, Reiche called for better protection for the
lines. ``This precious thing should be treated like a very fragile
manuscript that is guarded in a special room in a library,'' she
said.

Security Council demands cease-fire in Afghanistan
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   UNITED NATIONS (AP) _ In a sharp statement singling out the
Taliban for criticism, the Security Council demanded an immediate
end to fighting in Afghanistan and called for renewed peace talks
under the U.N. mantle.
	   Forces opposed to the ruling Taliban religious militia are
backed into a small corner of northern Afghanistan, and the Taliban
appears poised to capture all of the country.
	   In fierce fighting this week, it advanced on Mazar-e-Sharif, the
stronghold of the northern alliance.
	   The council ``demands an urgent and unconditional cease-fire
leading to a final end to the hostilities,'' its statement said.
	   ``The Afghan crisis can be settled only by peaceful means,
through direct negotiations between the Afghan factions under
United Nations auspices,'' it said.
	   Thursday's statement singled out the Taliban for last month's
expulsion of non-U.N. and non-Red Cross aid workers.
	   ``The council deplores the measures taken by the Taliban, which
have made it impossible for nearly all humanitarian organizations
to continue their work in Kabul.''
	   Taliban officials have been insisting that aid agencies that
want to work in Kabul must move from offices and homes scattered
throughout the Afghan capital to dilapidated dormitories on the
campus of Kabul Polytechnic, which has been heavily damaged in the
years of civil war.
	   International aid groups say they are committed to providing
education and other services to all Afghans, while Taliban
officials accuse the agencies of flouting the country's laws and
traditions.
	   Taliban officials have imposed a strict interpretation of Islam
since capturing Kabul in 1996, barring girls from school and
restricting most women to their homes.
	   The Security Council also called on ``all states to refrain from
any outside interference in the internal affairs of Afghanistan,
including the involvement of foreign military personnel.''
	   Recent reports have said that Russian troops are backing the
northern alliance. Pakistan has long lent logistical support to the
Taliban.
	   U.N.-brokered peace talks between the warring factions that
opened in neighboring Pakistan in April broke down after one week,
over the dismantling of roadblocks.

Argentine runs a `little shop of horrors'
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; AP Photos NY315-317 &QL; 
 &UR; By DANIEL ZADUNAISKY &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   BUENOS AIRES, Argentina (AP) _ The questions come with the
territory.
	   ``Please, sir, can they hurt my kitten?''
	   ``Should I feed them hamburger?''
	   ``Do they really eat meat?''
	   Carlos Campos Fuentes fields dozens of questions like these
every week. He is the proprietor and sole employee of The
Carnivorous Collection _ a small shop that specializes in
carnivorous plants.
	   Of course, there's nothing like the voracious vegetables that
nearly devoured Seymour, hero of ``Little Shop of Horrors,'' the
musical play and movie based on Roger Corman's 1950s horror film.
	   But people ``still are influenced by old legends about huge,
man-eating plants,'' Campos Fuentes said. ``The same legends the
Spanish conquistadors brought here in the 16th century make people
come to my shop with a mixture of fear and fascination.''
	   When a friend brought him the first specimens of Venus flytrap
from California, he was immediately intrigued, Campos Fuentes said.
He'd always been a plant lover, but these were different from any
he had seen.
	   First he began cultivating them for himself, then he opened the
shop, where sells them for the equivalent of dlrs 20 to dlrs 30
each. As far as he knows, nobody else in Argentina cultivates or
sells them.
	   This is only a hobby for Campos Fuentes, whose real business is
selling conventional plants for interior decoration.
	   The Venus flytrap, or dionaea muscipula, is the best known of
the carnivores. Two flaps lie open in wait for insects, which are
attracted by a sweet nectar. When a bug brushes any one of three
sensitive hairs, the flaps shut. By the time they open some 10 days
later, the insect has been digested.
	   The pitcher plant (sarracena purpurea) looks like a half-filled
balloon. It also attracts insects with a sweet nectar, but down
into a pitcher filled with a digestive fluid from which there is no
escape.
	   When an insect lands on the leaf of a sundew (drosera
rotundifolia), sticky tentacles immediately hold it fast until the
digestive glands secrete their juices.
	   Students buy the shop's plants for biology classes, Campos
Fuentes said. Parents buy them because they're better than a pet if
a family lives in a small apartment.
	   Most people who pass the shop, stop and look. A few ask
questions.
	   Marta, a housewife, said she'd never buy one. ``What if it bites
me when I try to feed it?'' she said with a grimace.
	   You don't have to feed them, Campos Fuentes said. All you have
to do is water them. Like other plants, they make their own
nutrients and don't need to eat.
	   ``The insects are just an added treat,'' he said.

Security Council gives blessing to Cambodia elections
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   UNITED NATIONS (AP) _ Elections in Cambodia were not perfect,
but went reasonably well, the U.N. Security Council said.
	   ``In essence the election results, and the existing assessment
of the election process were what could be expected,'' Danilo Turk,
the Slovene delegate and current council president, told reporters
Thursday.
	   Co-Prime Minister Hun Sen's Cambodian People's Party emerged as
the winner of the July 26 election when long-delayed complete
preliminary results were announced Wednesday.
	   The main opposition parties are alleging there was rampant fraud
in voting and ballot-counting, and that international observers to
oversee the polls were inadequate.
	   The main group of international observers who helped monitor
Cambodia's parliamentary election defended the quality and coverage
of its work, saying the observers were experienced.
	   They were backed by the Security Council. ``There is nothing
such as perfect elections, but by and large the opinion is that the
elections went reasonably well, I mean in the technical sense,''
Turk said.
	   The opposition parties have threatened to block the formation of
a new government by boycotting the new National Assembly session if
their complaints are not properly investigated.
	   Turk said it was time to move on.
	   ``There remain further tasks for the future related to the
strenghthening of democracy and the development of Cambodia,'' he
said.

Tibetans rebuild monastery from communism's ravages

<TEXT>
	   ZHONGDIAN, China (AP) _ Thirty-two years ago, the Tibetans of
Zhongdian county tore down their 300-year-old Buddhist monastery to
meet Mao Tse-tung's radical cry for a communist new order.
	   Now, with their own hands and money, they are undoing the
destruction that ideology wrought.
	   For 14 years, they have labored to resurrect Gedan Songzan
monastery from the ruins of charred beams and broken mud walls
scattered over the windswept hillock outside Zhongdian town, in
China's southwestern Yunnan province. They will probably need seven
more years.
	   ``Our monastery was destroyed. Now it's up to us to rebuild
it,'' said Luosang Nibu, a 26-year-old farmer, as he planed pine
boards outside a half-built dormitory for monks from his Little
Zhongdian village, 15 kilometers (10 miles) to the south.
	   Luosang left his family's two-hectare (five-acre) farm with its
horses and yaks to spend two months this spring building the
dormitory. Little Zhongdian's wealthy loggingtruck drivers donated
funds for construction. Luosang worked for free.
	   ``This is my contribution to religion,'' he said.
	   Day after day, modest farmers like Luosang and a few paid day
laborers saw planks, pack walls of mud and rock and erect columns
for dormitories and prayer halls. Elderly monks, their bodies
gnarled from years of forced labor when religion was outlawed,
shovel dirt alongside novices in their teens.
	   The monastery's mammoth main prayer hall with its towering white
walls and golden roof rises three stories from the hill's crest,
shadowing two other large temples. Eight dormitories to house about
500 monks stand in various stages of progress.
	   The monastery was once the largest in Diqing, a trio of
Tibetan-dominated counties lying across broad valleys sloping from
peaks of more than 5,500 meters (18,000 feet) off Tibet's
southeastern edge. Gedan Songzan had links to the great monasteries
of Lhasa, ruled by the Dalai Lama, and drew the patronage of
China's Kangxi emperor in the 17th century. More than 2,000 monks
studied under as many as 17 scholarly lamas.
	   Then in late 1966, local officials enforcing Mao's call for a
radical reshaping of society, a ``Cultural Revolution,'' ordered
Gedan Songzan torn down. Every village was forced to send workers
to help in the two-week dismantling. Zealous crowds beat the monks.
One learned lama died from his injuries.
	   Tibetans did not get permission to rebuild Gedan Songzan until
1984. Since then the county government has set aside 3 million yuan
(dlrs 360,000) for repairs. Local people have contributed three
times that much.
	   ``The government isn't giving enough money. All this comes from
the people,'' said Luozang Nangpo, the 52-year-old master carpenter
overseeing the reconstruction. He learned his carpentry in secret
during the Cultural Revolution from a master temple builder.
	   ``This temple is something that has existed for hundreds of
years, not just a few decades,'' said Luozang. ``Not rebuilding it
was inconceivable.''

Remember Teapot Dome? Government prepares to shed scandal site

<TEXT>
	   MIDWEST, Wyoming (AP) _ Navy Lt. Doug Tunison's command is a sea
of grass, 9,400 acres (3,800 hectares) of sage and rock where
antelope and mule deer graze next to slow-pumping oil rigs. He is
more than 900 miles (1,400 kilometers) from an ocean.
	   ``The Navy doesn't really understand what I'm doing out here,''
he says.
	   Tunison, a petroleum engineer, keeps watch over Naval Petroleum
Reserve No. 3, better known as Teapot Dome.
	   Last fall, Congress decreed he will be the last in a long line
of naval officers who have kept an eye on the oil field since a
scandal rocked President Warren Harding's administration in 1922.
	   The Department of Energy will give up the oil field in 2003,
when consultants estimate it will be no longer profitable for the
government.
	   Through the years, the officer's job has evolved from naval
watchdog to petroleum production manager.
	   Tunison performs his duties without the polished brass of a
naval officer. There is no military formality here. He usually
looks like the field's other 13 government workers, wearing a hard
hat, khaki pants and dusty steel-toed boots.
	   Aside from rare visits by Navy or government officials, Tunison
has only one military duty a year: the Navy ball. In Wyoming,
mainly reserve officers attend.
	   Tunison's tour, about 35 miles (60 kilometers) northeast of
Casper in central Wyoming, ends in 15 months. He will be reassigned
to work with construction contractors at naval bases. ``Any job in
Europe would be nice,'' he said.
	   At about the same time, Department of Energy officials hope to
submit legislation to sell Teapot Dome to a private company or a
group that would open it to drilling research.
	   In 1981, production at Teapot Dome peaked at 5,000 barrels a
day. But now, 83 years after it opened, daily production is only
about 800 barrels and experts expect that to drop to 150 barrels in
five years.
	   In contrast, Wyoming's top-producing oil fields pump up to 4,000
barrels a day.
	   The surface, bordered by slanting rock ridges, is littered with
abandoned wells and equipment from the field's heyday.
	   Time has even taken its toll on a nearby rock formation that
looked like a teapot to early prospectors. A 1962 windstorm broke
off the teapot's spout.
	   But the dome, underground layers of rock shaped liked an
upside-down bowl, is better known for its place in history than its
oil.
	   The government took control in 1915 when President Woodrow
Wilson set it aside in case the Navy needed oil for battleships,
destroyers and other warships as World War I approached.
	   The Navy never used Teapot Dome's oil directly. After the war,
the field was transferred to the Department of the Interior and
oilmen pressed their claims on it.
	   From 1921 to 1922, Interior Secretary Albert Fall secretly
leased the field to oilman Harry Sinclair without public bids as
required by law. Fall resigned and was convicted for taking bribes
from several oilmen, including Sinclair. He spent one year in
prison.
	   Sinclair was acquitted but jailed 6 1-2 months for hiring
detectives to monitor the jury.
	   Sinclair Oil Co., with the green dinosaur logo on gas station
signs, remains the biggest buyer of Teapot Dome oil.
	   After the scandal, the Navy retook control of the field and most
of its oil was undisturbed until the late 1970s. The Naval
Petroleum Reserves Act of 1976 required that it be developed and
its crude sold directly to commercial markets.
	   ``The history of why I'm here makes the job interesting,''
Tunison said. ``It's pretty obscure.''
	   By 1992, the government concluded that falling oil prices and
rising production costs would make the field uneconomical. Still,
it is expected to earn about dlrs 3 million in revenue this year.
	   With oil prices hovering between dlrs 14 and dlrs 15 a barrel,
the prospect of finding a buyer for Teapot Dome may not be good.
	   ``These are not attractive assets,'' said David Lauciault, an
oil and gas industry consultant for A.T. Kearney in Dallas. ``By
almost any measure, these assets are sub-par.''
	   Until 2003, Tunison and Department of Energy officials will try
to find ways to cut costs and continue to make a profit.
	   ``How do you get out of the business to get the most money for
the taxpayers?'' asked Clarke Turner, director of Naval Petroleum
and Oil Shale Reserves in Colorado, Utah and Wyoming. ``Congress
doesn't want us to lose money.''
	   The Department of Energy has offered options for the oil field:
	   The government could sell it, probably to a small independent
producer that would continue production of oil on a small scale.
	   Or, the government-run Rocky Mountain Oilfield Testing Center
program could allow oil companies and universities to use it to
test new drilling or extraction methods.
	   Turner has proposed that a group of universities and companies
buy the program and the oil field for a test center. The government
plans to transfer the program to private groups by 2001 anyway.
	   Or, the Department of Interior, the state, or a private trust
could purchase the land as a park or wildlife conservation area.
	   Or, a final option would be to plug and abandon all the wells
and sell the land for grazing.
	   ``I can't really see a definite path,'' Tunison said.

	   MAPER, Sudan (AP) _ Hundreds of hungry women, some clutching
babies, clustered by a water pump under the scorching sun of the
African savanna, waiting for a U.N. food handout that is one of the
few hopes for survival.
	   Their wait ended in terror.
	   Gunmen in the distance fired off about a dozen shots, sending
the women and aid workers fleeing in panic, abandoning 60 tons of
bagged corn just dropped from a Hercules cargo plane.
	   It was weeks before the area was safe enough for U.N. personnel
to return to Maper, a village in southern Sudan. All they found
recently were a few rotting corpses draped across the charred
remains of 50-kilogram (110-pound) sacks of corn.
	   Food is a key weapon in Sudan's devastating 15-year civil war,
and stories of armed bands forcing hungry civilians to abandon food
deliveries are common.
	   The destruction of the corn at Maper, which could have fed 1,800
families for almost a month, is particularly worrisome amid reports
that 350,000 people are facing starvation in southern Sudan and
that at least 1 million more desperately go hungry.
	   For almost 30 years, U.N. agencies have been delivering food to
Sudan's hungry.
	   This year, the mission is battling the same factors that keep
turning droughts into killer famines: marauding bands that burn
crops and food shipments, fighting that has displaced millions, and
a government that sees aid as a weapon.
	   ``In the short term, you are saving lives, you are building
something,'' said Claude Jibidar, field coordinator for the U.N.
World Food Program in southern Sudan. ``But at the end of the day,
we fear it is destroyed.''
	   The mission is also hugely expensive, blunting the impact of the
dlrs 325 million that donor states have spent during the past six
years to send food through the United Nations to Sudan's hungry.
	   In some of its aid to Sudan, the World Food Program is
delivering only 11 1-2 cents worth of food for each dollar spent.
Much of the remaining money is spent on aircraft for food delivery
flights to areas too remote for road transport.
	   The frustration that millions of dollars spent on aid is being
swept away in the chaos of war is not just limited to Sudan.
	   The World Food Program has been delivering food to victims of
fighting in Afghanistan since 1980 and to Angola for about eight
years, with little end in sight to either mission.
	   Frustration over wasted aid is clearly felt by donor nations.
	   Last year, the United Nations received only 40 percent of the
dlrs 120 million it felt was needed for relief in southern Sudan.
That was even lower than the 65 percent overall response rate for
the dlrs 1.5 billion it had sought for 11 U.N. relief missions
worldwide.
	   Foreign governments are responding to the Sudan emergency this
year, but both donors and aid workers would like to see the aid
money go to real development unhampered by war.
	   ``Relief food ... is only a temporary measure,'' said Dan Effie
of Norwegian People's Aid, a relief group active in southern Sudan.
Without a political solution ``you might as well pour the money
down the Nile.''
	   ___
	   The village of Maper, where the gunshots led to the abandoned
food shipment, points up all the troubles and frustrations to
delivering aid in Sudan.
	   The World Food Program must fly food into the region because of
a lack of roads. Maper is about 500 miles (800 kilometers) south of
Sudan's capital, Khartoum, and a two-hour flight from the agency's
base at Lokichokkio, Kenya, just across the border with Sudan.
	   Maper is also in Bahr el-Ghazal province, which is at the center
of Sudan's civil war and one of the areas hit hardest by famine _
where relief workers charge that food aid has been manipulated by
both the government and the rebels.
	   The province is home to soldiers and leaders of the Sudan
People's Liberation Army. It has been battling a national
government dominated by northern Arabs seeking more autonomy for
black southerners, who are mostly Christians or members of tribal
faiths.
	   The day before the shooting at Maper, World Food Program workers
had helped distribute food to 1,800 women in a field across from
the UNICEF water pump and thatched huts at the center of the
village.
	   Nearby, a few children in the remains of a burned mud-brick hut
separated small pebbles from yellow kernels of corn that had
spilled from sacks dropped from the delivery plane. Several SPLA
militiamen in mismatched uniforms _ some barefoot _ rested under
trees.

	   Alueth Alhuai Mathiang, one of the women who received food that
day, walked six hours from the river where her family was hiding.
	   Mathiang and her husband, Gaar, had been prosperous herders in
the village of Nyok Yout, to the east of Maper. Although their area
suffered drought for two years, it was not crop failure that left
them destitute.
	   A month before the Maper incident, she said, hundreds of gunmen
on horseback charged into their village, burning houses and
stealing livestock, including the Mathiangs' goats and 50 cows and
bulls.
	   The couple, with their seven children, were reduced to foraging
for leaves to boil and eat until a village chief told Mathiang that
a U.N. plane would deliver food to Maper.
	   ``All that we had was destroyed,'' she said. ``When I get the
help, I'll give it to my children.''
	   Mathiang and 1,800 other women left Maper carrying bags filled
with nearly 33 kilograms (73 pounds) of corn for their families.
	   Food for another 1,800 families was scheduled to be given out
the next day. Instead, gunshots rang out from the fields behind the
huts, and terrified women grabbed their children and water gourds
and ran.
	   A half dozen aid workers tossed their tents and radio onto a
pickup truck and sped off down a dirt path toward the nearby town
of Turalei. A few SPLA militiamen toting assault rifles jumped
aboard the vehicle, along with an Associated Press reporter who was
covering the aid distribution.
	   The militiamen shouted at farmers from atop the truck, warning
them to flee. Throughout the countryside, people could be seen
chasing their cattle _ often the target of raiders _ into the bush.
Women ran from their homes carrying their few pots and gourds on
their heads.
	   That week alone, the World Food Program pulled out four of its
11 teams in southern Sudan after threats of attacks in the region.
	   Agot Deng Akok had expected to receive food on the second day of
distribution in Maper. An elderly widow with a wizened face and
shriveled, mud-caked legs, she had come to Maper with her only food
_ three handfuls of crushed corn _ wrapped in a filthy, gray shawl.
	   That was all she had when she left.
	   ___
	   ``Food is a weapon of war and it is manipulated by all parties
of the conflict,'' said Ted Chaiban, deputy director of Operation
Lifeline Sudan, the umbrella organization for U.N. agencies and
independent aid groups working in southern Sudan.
	   Aid workers say limiting relief flights is one way Sudan's
government has directed the flow of food. From February until
April, the government barred or limited relief flights to Bahr
el-Ghazal province, blaming it on fighting in the region.
	   According to aid workers, the result was a delay in getting
seeds to farmers during planting season, likely meaning a
desperately needed harvest will be slashed in half.
	   ``Anyone who tells you that relief is neutral is an idiot,''
said Effie, the Norwegian aid worker. ``Relief always has a
political impact.''
	   Many aid workers suspect some raids to destroy food or steal
cattle are backed by the government in a strategy to wipe out the
rebel's base of support.
	   U.N. aid workers also believe some of the food aid, which they
distribute only to women, is passed to children or relatives who
fight with rebel militias.
	   ``You distribute it and they redistribute it the way they think
it should be, which could be to their sons ... to the people who
protect them,'' said one aid worker, who agreed to speak about the
operation only if his name was not used.
	   In Maper, the militiamen lolling about the village showed that
the Sudan People's Liberation Army was nominally in control of that
area.
	   In some areas, where the movement does not have widespread
support, militiamen demand 10 percent to 20 percent of the food
given needy families, some aid workers said.
	   Battles with government troops or between rebels of different
tribes also blunt the impact of aid. Changing battle fronts can
mean relief workers must quickly deliver food and flee instead of
staying to monitor who gets the aid.
	   The other factor obstructing aid is the cost of distribution
since the lack of roads means trucking in food can take weeks or
months. The World Food Program spends dlrs 800,000 a month for each
of the five Hercules planes it leases for air drops, and it hires
other planes, too.
	   In the case of Maper, shipments of corn cost dlrs 1,788 per ton.
Just over dlrs 200 goes for buying corn; the rest is for
administrative and transportation costs _ almost dlrs 1,000 of it
eaten up by the plane flights.
	   ``All of us are very concerned about the high cost,'' said Larry
Meserve, head of USAID's Sudan field office. ``But there are not a
lot of alternatives in the short term to saving lives.''

	   TORONTO (AP) _ Rain throughout Thursday forced postponement of
the day's schedule in the du Maurier Open tennis tournament.
	   Only three games were played all day and Yevgeny Kafelnikov won
them all in taking a 3-0 lead over MaliVai Washington.
	   A light, intermittent rain delayed the afternoon session and it
was raining more heavily Thursday evening when officials scrapped

Egypt and U.N. in tug-of-war over goals of aid to the poor

<TEXT>
	   NUBARIYA, Egypt (AP) _ Mustafa Ali and his wife have two houses,
two water buffalo and two farms tilled by laborers paid with food
the couple gets under a U.N. program aimed at helping Egypt's
poorest.
	   The two university graduates are hardly considered impoverished
in a country where tens of thousands of peasants like the family's
laborers have no land at all.
	   But Mustafa and Amani Ali are profiting because Egypt wants to
direct aid to unemployed college and technical school graduates _ a
group it considers a potential political threat.
	   The U.N. World Food Program, although helping the Egyptian
campaign, argues the aid should feed the poorest _ rural women and
landless farmers.
	   This tug-of-war is replayed in many places, especially in poorer
nations, where aid dollars can have a significant impact on the
economy and local political concerns are often at odds with the
goals of aid groups. Usually, it is the powerless who lose out in
the struggle.
	   In Egypt, the government desperately wants to resettle
unemployed college graduates like the Alis away from city slums,
which are fertile recruiting grounds for Islamic militants opposed
to the country's secular system.
	   For the past 10 years, the World Food Program has helped that
goal, spending more than dlrs 40 million to send wheat, cooking
oil, lentils, sugar and tea to 20,000 families that have settled on
reclaimed desert land to farm. Most of the recipients are college
graduates.
	   The U.N. relief agency tried unsuccessfully to steer the program
toward its own goal of serving the poor and now says it's getting
tough, imposing quotas and threatening to withhold aid if targets
are not met.
	   ``We have to take care of the poorest of the poor,'' said
Christa Rader of the agency's Egypt office. ``I think it is time
that the government realize that we are serious.''
	   In Nubariya, a vast expanse of reclaimed desert land 80
kilometers (50 miles) south of Alexandria, settlers like the Alis
receive U.N. food for four years while they learn to farm the
rocky, sandy soil. Each settler gets enough food for five people.
	   Each also receives a small, squat, red-brick house with two
rooms, five feddans (acres) of land and some irrigation equipment
under a 30-year interest-free loan from the government.
	   Some settler families, like the Alis, get double food rations
and two houses if a husband and wife are accepted separately into
the program or marry after being accepted. They are, however, a
minority.
	   As far as the Alis are concerned, the U.N. food aid is necessary
to achieve the legitimate goals of reclaiming land and creating
jobs.
	   ``It is vital to the family. Cash is not always available,''
said Ali, an unemployed accountant before moving to Nubariya last
September.
	   Suzan Mohammed Kamel, the Agriculture Ministry's coordinator for
the Nubariya project, said it is vital to get the unemployed
graduates settled on reclaimed land, adding that many of them are
from farm families and have few resources.
	   ``If they were not here, they would be in the streets,'' she
said.
	   She said the resettled graduates also give jobs to the poor.
``They have no good experience with the land so they have to resort
to laborers to help them.''
	   Ali, for example, has five workers who are paid in part with
food from his U.N. allotment but who also get 5 Egyptian pounds
(dlrs 1.50) a day each.
	   The World Food Program says the government program must focus
directly on the most disenfranchised in Egyptian society _ female
heads of households and landless peasants.
	   ``If we look at the poorest of the poor, we have to gradually
say good-bye to the graduates,'' said Peter Selmer, head of the
agency's office in Cairo.
	   He has told the Egyptian government that 40 percent of settlers
in the program must be landless peasants and 4 percent must be
country women who head households.
	   ``They know this and they have accepted it,'' Selmer said.
	   Officials have promised to cut out double benefits to people
like the Alis.
	   The government also is offering to resettle 3,000 landless
farmers from southern Egypt, a region where the World Food
Program's mandate to feed the poor dovetails with Egypt's need to
resettle people who lost their land when rent controls were
scrapped for tenant farms.
	   Settling landless women is more of a problem because in
conservative, rural communities women are expected to stay at home,
not be homesteaders.
	   The success of the land reclamation program is crucial to Egypt.
Once the breadbasket of the Mediterranean, it can no longer feed
its own people and is banking on costly projects to make the desert
bloom.
	   In Nubariya, the government has allocated dlrs 143.4 million to
give the settlers houses and land. The World Food Program is
spending dlrs 18 million over four years to feed 13,000 settlers in
a new phase of the program that began in September 1996.
	   ``The government would never be able to provide food to the
area,'' Kamel said. ``It is difficult enough for the government to
meet the needs of people living in towns and in Cairo.''
	   Things could be worse as far as countries trying to impose their
goals on international aid. Last year, the charity World Vision
shut down its programs in Eritrea after the government ordered it
to stop monitoring where donations were spent.
	   Andrew Natsios, a former World Vision vice president, said
developing countries often push their own goals for using foreign
aid, but added that such things also happen in the West with
government programs.
	   ``Do you think all the government funding in the United States
is based on need?'' he asked. ``It is based on congressmen and the
... need for re-election.''

Dollar lower, Japanese stock prices rise in early trading
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ The U.S. dollar edged lower against the yen early
Friday prior to a policy speech by the Japanese prime minister
later in the day. Tokyo stock prices rebounded in light trading.
	   The dollar bought 144.52 yen, down 0.15 yen from late Thursday
in Tokyo but above its late New York rate of 144.32 yen overnight.
	   Traders are looking to Prime Minister Keizo Obuchi to lead Japan
out of its worst recession in decades. But many stayed on the
sidelines to await his inaugural policy speech to Parliament,
slated for 1:00 p.m. (0400 GMT).
	   Obuchi was expected to detail his plans for more than 6 trillion
yen (dlrs 41.6 billion) in tax cuts to stimulate Japan's economy.
	   On the Tokyo Stock Exchange, share prices bounced back on the
strength of an overnight rise on Wall Street and higher futures
prices on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange on Thursday.
	   The Dow Jones industrial average closed at 8,577.68 on Thursday,
up 30.90.
	   Many investors in Tokyo were shying away from making significant
moves ahead of the prime minister's speech.
	   The 225-issue Nikkei Stock Average rose 111.93 points, or 0.71
percent, to 15,995.15 points in the first 30 minutes of trading. On
Thursday, the Nikkei index closed down 115.94 points, or 0.72
percent.
	   The Tokyo Stock Price Index of all issues listed on the first
section was up 3.69 points, or 0.30 percent, to 1,230.78. The TOPIX
closed down 8.69 points, or 0.70 percent, the day before.
	   Meanwhile, the yield on the benchmark No. 182 10-year Japanese
government bond was unquoted in early trading, compared with
Thursday's finish of 1.215 percent. Its price, also unquoted,
closed at 111.68 yen Thursday.

<TEXT>
	   WARSAW, Poland (AP) _ Responding to a plea from Israel, the
Polish government has said it doesn't have the authority to remove
dozens of crosses erected outside the Auschwitz death camp by Roman
Catholic faithful.
	   The crosses have been put up over the last two weeks at the
urging of a conservative Catholic radio station to protest efforts
to remove a much larger, 26-foot (8-meter) cross that has stood
just yards (meters) from the camp's wall since 1988.
	   Jewish groups around the world have long protested the presence
of the cross so close to the Nazi death camp, saying it harms the
memory of the Holocaust's Jewish victims.
	   Israel asked Wednesday that the 50-plus smaller crosses be taken
down. The Polish government, however, said the crosses were on
private property, and that the Roman Catholic Church, not the
state, was responsible for religious symbols in Poland.
	   On Thursday, Yisrael Cohen, spokesman for Israel's Holocaust
memorial, said the Polish government was violating an international
agreement protecting the memory of Jews killed by the Nazis at
Auschwitz.
	   He said his organization, Yad Vashem, the U.S. Holocaust Museum
in Washington, the Polish government and church authorities signed
an agreement earlier this year forbidding the presence of
``religious, ideological or political symbols,'' at the death camp.
	   ``We plan to continue pressuring the Polish government into
meeting its commitment and the immediate removal of the crosses,''
Cohen said.
	   The large cross was used during a 1979 papal Mass and was later
placed on the grounds of a former Carmelite nunnery on Auschwitz's
periphery to commemorate the event and honor the memory of Poles
executed at the site by the Nazis.
	   The government had sought to mediate a solution to the dispute
earlier this year when the nuns handed the property over to the
state. However, since then, a veteran's group has claimed legal
rights to the property based on a 35-year-old rental agreement.
	   The church, meanwhile, defended the placement of additional
crosses at the site. ``This is Polish soil and all imposition of
other will is seen as interference into sovereignty,'' said Jozef
Glemp, the head of Poland's Catholic church.
	   From 1940-45, some 1.5 million people, mostly Jews, were killed
in the camp's gas chambers, executed or died of starvation, disease
and forced labor.

<TEXT>
	   UNITED NATIONS (AP) _ Choosing words over warfare, the Security
Council called Iraq's refusal to allow arms inspections ``totally
unacceptable'' but dangled the possibility of U.N. concessions if
Saddam Hussein cooperated.
	   The 15-member council on Thursday condemned Iraq's decision to
snub weapons chief Richard Butler, but did not disclose what it
planned to do about it, except to engage more closely with Iraq.
	   ``The Security Council called the Iraqi action totally
unacceptable,'' said the council's current president, Ambassador
Danilo Turk of Slovenia.
	   Iraq's actions run contrary to an agreement Secretary-General
Kofi Annan struck with Saddam in February, the last time Iraq cut
off the inspectors from doing their jobs, the council said. The
deal averted an attack by the United States and Britain, who had
sent forces to the Gulf to back their insistence on inspections.
	   This time, however, there seemed to be little appetite for a
fight, as the statement's plea for increased dialogue received
unanimous approval from council members. The council even hinted it
may ease sanctions, saying it ``intends to respond favorably to
future progress.''
	   ``I believe the Iraqi position on this issue is not a closed
one,'' said Annan, who consulted with Iraqi Deputy Prime Minister
Tariq Aziz before attending the council session. ``... It might be
helpful to engage the Iraqis much more closely than we have,'' he
said.
	   Even U.S. Ambassador Bill Richardson backed the coordinated
Security Council effort.
	   ``We are acting in consultation with the U.N. Security
Council,'' he said. ``This is not a battle between the United
States and Iraq.''
	   Talks with Iraq broke down Monday, when Butler refused to supply
an immediate certification that Iraq has destroyed all of its
weapons of mass destruction _ chemical and biological arms and
long-range missiles.
	   Iraq told weapons inspectors Thursday that they cannot check new
sites. It also banned surprise checks by the U.N. nuclear agency.
	   One option may be to consider proposals by some members, notably
Russia and France, to alleviate some sanctions. Russia and France
have pending financial interests in Iraq, while other nations are
concerned about the effect of the sanctions, which the Iraqis blame
for the deaths of 500 children a month.
	   The council's actions also reflected international weariness
with the issue _ a factor that the Iraqis hope will accelerate
lifting of the sanctions, which have debilitated Iraq for eight
years.
	   ``We need to see deeds, not words,'' Said Hasan, the Iraqi
charge d'Affaires at the United Nations, said. ``We are frustrated,
we are fed up ... it is now so clear Mr. Butler changes his
declarations from time to time.''
	   Iraq said it believed Butler's attention to detail and his
demand for documentation was a ploy to extend the sanctions at the
behest of the United States. Butler had said he found the stance
puzzling because the commission is close to saying Iraq has no
weapons of mass destruction in some areas.
	   Yet even Butler, a technician who often eschews diplomatic
niceties, has softened his tone considerably in recent days,
calling for ``creative'' solutions and leading to speculation that
he was under fire from his bosses. Support for Butler, however, was
strong Thursday.
	   Later in a CNN interview Thursday, Butler called Iraq's actions
an ``Iraqi syndrome'' that calls for a ``slightly new creative
way'' of getting weapons inspections done without ``repeating this
syndrome every few months.''
	   Annan said Butler had done a ``very good job'' and expressed
some sympathy for Iraq as well.
	   ``They seem to have gained the view that whatever they do and
all their efforts to comply or what they call satisfactory
compliance has not been recognized ... I think the frustrations
came through if not desperation,'' he said.
	   Annan, however, was incensed at Iraq's suggestion that the
weapons inspectors be moved to Geneva or Vienna in order to
decrease U.S. influence.
	   ``No individual member state can tell the U.N. how to structure
itself to carry out tasks or mandates given to it,'' he said.

Anglican bishops slap U.S. church over women priests
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: Recaps previous &QL; 
 &UR; By ROBERT BARR &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   CANTERBURY, England (AP) _ A New Zealand woman bishop's attempt
to soothe the continuing tensions within the Anglican Communion
over the ordination of women has drawn protests from women bishops
in the United States.
	   But bishops meeting at the Lambeth Conference on Thursday
endorsed the resolution, which implicitly rebuked the Episcopal
Church in the United States for the way it cracked down on four
die-hard opponents of women priests.
	   The resolution, which says there should be ``no compulsion on
any bishop in matters concerning ordination and licensing,''
disagrees with changes in canon law adopted last year by the
Episcopal Church. The canons gave the recalcitrant bishops until
the year 2000 to comply.
	   As a consultative body of the 70 million worldwide Anglican
community, the Lambeth Conference has no authority to override the
decision of any national church.
	   The U.S. church began ordaining women in 1976, and now has an
estimated 1,500 women priests _ about 10 percent of the total.
About half of the national churches within Anglicanism now ordain
women as priests and three, in the United States, New Zealand and
Canada, have consecrated women bishops.
	   The resolution was proposed by the Rt. Rev. Penny Jamieson,
bishop of Dunedin, New Zealand, one of 11 women bishops at the
Lambeth Conference. The text, worked out in meetings with a group
of traditionalist bishops, urged, ``courtesy, tolerance, mutual
respect and prayer for one another.''
	   ``While the language indeed, seems gracious, it contravenes the
ordination canons of the Episcopal Church, U.S.A., and, I believe
the discipline in the provinces of Canada and New Zealand,'' said
the Rt. Rev. Barbara Harris, bishop of Massachusetts, and first
female Anglican bishop.
	   The Rt. Rev Catherine Waynick, bishop of Indianapolis, also
opposed the resolution.
	   ``What sort of unity would we be able to sustain in our
worldwide communion if provinces were not able to articulate their
own internal disciplines for themselves on any given issue?''
Waynick said.
	   The Rt. Rev. Michael Scott-Joynt, bishop of Winchester, England,
said he supported the ordination of women but opposed any coercion
of opponents.
	   Every report of coercion ``makes it all the harder for the many
people in all our churches who are seeking to hold in the greatest
possible fellowship those who take differing views on the
ordination of women,'' he said.
	   The Rt. Rev. Ray Smith of Sydney, Australia, warned against
forgetting assurances which were given to traditionalists when
Anglican churches began ordaining women.
	   ``There is a danger of traditionalists being coerced against the
conscience to do certain things, to allow to certain things, or if
they cannot comply, to be forced out of the communion,'' he said.

	   PRISTINA, Yugoslavia (AP) _ The leader of Kosovo's ethnic
Albanians has declared a day of mourning Friday for the hundreds
who have died fighting Serb forces as aid workers scrambled to help
tens of thousands of refugees.
	   The U.N. refugee agency has estimated the number of people who
are refugees in Kosovo, a province of Serbia, at about 200,000.
Many of them lack food, water and other essentials.
	   ``The situation in Kosovo has deteriorated significantly and can
now only be described as a humanitarian disaster,'' said a
statement from Carol Bellamy, executive director of the U.N.
Children's Fund (UNICEF).
	   ``The principal victims of the escalating violence are children
and women. Some 200,000 people have been displaced facing daily
terror, the loss of their homes, severe malnutrition and a range of
health crises,'' the statement said.
	   ``If concerted and effective international initiative is not
taken soon, world leaders risk seeing the situation in Kosovo
escalate to grotesque levels of violence and brutality,'' it added.
	   The refugees have been displaced by the current offensive
launched by Serbian forces seeking to push back and defeat the
underground Kosovo Liberation Army fighting for the independence
for Kosovo.
	   Kosovo is a province in southern Serbia where ethnic Albanians
represent 90 percent of the population. Serbia and the smaller
republic of Montenegro make up what is left of Yugoslavia.
	   There were some indications that fighting had somewhat ebbed on
Thursday, although clashes were reported from several parts of the
province.
	   Ibrahim Rugova, the unofficial president of Kosovo who is
recognized only by his own people, declared Friday a day of
mourning for hundreds killed by the fighting, especially by the
current Serbian offensive.
	   International aid agencies continued efforts to care for the
tens of thousands of refugees scattered throughout the province.
	   Thousands were hiding in the hills around Negrovce, a village 25
kilometers (15 miles) west of Pristina, in ``extremely difficult
conditions,'' with no shelter and daytime temperatures up to 38
degrees Celsius (100 F), a statement by the Doctors Without Borders
group issued in Geneva said.
	   It said two mobile teams are traveling through Kosovo daily in
search of safe places where clinics can be set up with local
doctors' help and with a capacity for 350 consultations daily.
	   Patients are suffering above all from diarrhea, respiratory and
skin infections, as well as from stress, the statement said.

<TEXT>
	   LIMA, Peru (AP) _ Foreign Minister Eduardo Ferrero on Thursday
charged that Ecuadorean troops had infiltrated a remote stretch of
Peru's Andean foothills where the two countries fought a brief war
in early 1995.
	   News of the alleged incursion, which Ferrero called a
``provocation,'' caused President Alberto Fujimori to cancel a
planned trip to Colombia on Thursday to try to defuse the rising
tensions.
	   ``The president has canceled his trip, because he has decided it
is necessary to stay in the country until the situation is
clarified,'' Ferrero told a news conference.
	   Ferrero would only say that the incursion took place ``in the
last few weeks,'' when the Ecuadorean troops reached 12 miles (20
kilometers) inside Peruvian territory in the disputed Cordillera
del Condor region, 560 miles (900 kms) north of Lima.
	   There were no reports of clashes with Peruvian troops. He did
not say how many troops were involved.
	   Ecuador's military representative on an international mission
monitoring the disputed region, Gen. Carlos Calle, said Peru's
charge was ``completely false.''
	   The Andean neighbors regularly swap charges that the others'
troops had infiltrated their territory.
	   But this charge came as the two countries appeared set to
negotiate an end to a long-running dispute over 49 miles (78
kilometers) of unmarked border that had erupted in wars in 1941,
1981 and 1995.
	   Fujimori had said that the negotiations, which began after the
1995 conflict, were ``practically concluded.''
	   But tensions started growing on July 28 when two Peruvian
soldiers were injured when they stepped on land mines in the
disputed area amid a largely uninhabited wilderness.
	   Peru accused Ecuador of planting the mines and Ecuador accused
Peru of carrying out a troop build up in the region.

a windswept ruin which sits on a rocky outcrop in southwest
England.
	   Calling the artifact ``a find of a lifetime,'' Geoffrey
Wainwright, chief archaeologist for English Heritage, a
government-backed conservation agency, said that although there is
no evidence linking the stone directly with the romantic hero, the
slate is proof that the name Arthur existed at the time he is
reputed to have lived.
	   The slate, measuring 35 centimeters (14 inches) by 20
centimeters (8 inches) bears the inscription ``ARTOGNOV,'' the
Latin of a British name Arthnou. Archaeologists found it July 4.
	   Literary references to Arthur go back as far as the ninth
century, but it wasn't until the 12th century that he was
introduced as the romantic hero and associated with Tintagel by
writer Geoffrey of Monmouth .
	   There was no link between the historic Arthur, a sixth century
warlord who fought 12 battles at the time of the breakup of the
Roman Empire before his death in fighting in 510 A.D., and the
legendary King Arthur of Excalibur lore, Wainwright said.
	   ``Despite the obvious temptation to link the Arthnou stone to
either the historical or the legendary figure of Arthur, it must be
stressed there is no evidence to make this connection,'' he said.
``Nevertheless, it proves for the first time that the name existed
at that time and that the stone belonged to a person of status.''
	   He said the discovery was a coincidence which ``will enhance the
strong Arthur legend.''
	   Geoffrey of Monmouth, in his 1139 ``History of the Kings of
Britain,'' tells the story of Arthur's conception after the
high-king of Britain, Uther Pendragon, fell in love with Igraine, a
duke's young wife. The king persuaded the magician Merlin to
disguise him as the young woman's husband so that he could enter
Tintagel Castle and seduce her. That night, the story goes, the
future King Arthur was conceived.
	   Yet another version of the legend holds that Arthur was found
washed ashore by Merlin in a cave below the castle.
	   The excavation also shows that after the Romans left England in
410 A.D., some sort of headquarters _ if not royal, at least
belonging to a high-ranking official _ existed at Tintagel and that
the people there continued to maintain contact with the Roman
Empire, said Kevin Brady of the University of Glasgow, which
carried out the dig for English Heritage.
	   ``There is no doubt it was a place of great importance,'' he
said.
	   Today, the Tintagel area depends greatly on the legendary
connection with King Arthur and is a major tourist attraction. As a
guidebook says of Tintagel and King Arthur: ``Fact hereabouts is
tremendously hard to separate from fiction.''

War to escalate against Congolese rebels, Kabila says
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   KINSHASA, Congo (AP) _ President Laurent Kabila, swearing the
war ``will be long and popular,'' has promised to step up
resistance against Rwandan soldiers and Tutsi rebels making rapid
military gains in eastern Congo.
	   Kabila launched a verbal attack against Rwanda, which Congo
accuses of engineering the uprising.
	   ``The war will be long and popular, that is, the whole people of
Congo will defend their nation and sovereignty,'' said Kabila, who
wore a pair of green army fatigues Thursday as he addressed
government officials clad in military uniforms.
	   ``The people must defend themselves and not kneel,'' the
president said, vowing to recover territory lost to the rebels and
form civilian ``defense committees'' to protect communities.
	   ``If we do not keep our liberty, we will win it back by war,''
Kabila said. ``We will never accept slavery.''
	   Government spokesman Didier Mumenge warned Congo would ``extend
the war into Rwanda'' unless the international community pressured
the tiny country to withdraw Rwandan troops allegedly deployed in
Congo.
	   Congo's Justice Minister Mwenze Kongolo also pledged to
retaliate against Rwanda, Kabila's one-time ally.
	   ``This war started in Rwanda and it is going to end in Rwanda,''
Kongolo said on CNN.
	   Tutsi fighters _ known as Banyamulenge _ and Rwandan soldiers,
also Tutsis, who played a key role in Kabila's victory over
longtime dictator Mobutu Sese Seko last year, are believed to be
leading the rebel offense.
	   Like Kabila's followers who swept across the country from east
to west in eight months, the renegades have quickly captured
Congo's eastern cities near Rwanda's borders, while moving west
through the jungle interior towards the country's third city,
Kisangani.
	   Rwanda has repeatedly denied involvement in the conflict, but
aid workers and other eyewitnesses say they have seen Rwandan
troops.
	   Rebels apparently captured the city of Uvira south of Bukavu on
Thursday as fighting continued in Kisangani, according to aid
workers and rebels. A government official said Kisangani was firmly
in loyalists' hands.
	   About 30 Banyamulenge fighters were killed before rebels took
the city, said Joseph Mutambo, deputy leader of a new rebel-linked
political party.
	   At the opposite end of the country, gun battles continued in the
Atlantic coastline town of Muanda and the nearby Kitona village and
military base, about 250 kilometers (150 miles) from the capital of
Kinshasa.
	   Ethnic bitterness at the Banyamulenge and Rwandan Tutsis boiled
over in Kinshasa at a demonstration by thousands of protesters who
called for guns to join the fight against the Rwandans.
	   ``Give us weapons to go to Rwanda,'' demonstrators sang.
	   The demonstrators carried two stuffed effigies bearing the
images of former leading government officials _ both Tutsis _ who
have apparently joined the renegades.
	   Two goats representing the two _ Deogratias Bugera, a former
Kabila confidante, and ex-Foreign Minister Bizima Karaha _ were
sacrificed at the end of the protest.
	   Britain urged its citizens Thursday to leave Congo and the U.N.
evacuated its 77 non-essential staff members from Kinshasa. France
and the United States had earlier warned their citizens to leave.

Swiss police arrest Mexican wanted in massive airline fraud case
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By JOHN RICE &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   MEXICO CITY (AP) _ Swiss police have arrested a former Mexican
airline executive charged with dlrs 60 million fraud, the attorney
general's office said Thursday.
	   The case of Gerardo de Prevoisin is among the largest of several
major fraud cases during Mexico's current economic crisis.
	   The attorney general's office said in a news release that de
Prevoisin was arrested in Zurich on an extradition request by
Mexico charging administrative fraud against the country's largest
airline, Aerovias de Mexico, or Aeromexico.
	   It said Mexican officials would complete a petition for
extradition in the next few days.
	   The government claims that as president of Aeromexico's board,
de Prevoisin obtained personal loans using the airline as backing.
It said the loans were not repaid and the airline was held liable
for dlrs 57 million and 15 million pesos _ then worth about dlrs 4
million.
	   An arrest warrant was issued on Dec. 18, 1994, two days before
Mexico's peso collapsed, sending the nation's economy into a
tailspin that bankrupted many businesses and devastated the middle
class.
	   In a U.S. court case, de Prevoisin acknowledged that he withdrew
dlrs 8 million from the airline but says he donated it to the
governing Institutional Revolutionary Party, or PRI, with the
approval of Aeromexico's board of directors.
	   Mexico's ruling party denied it had received funds from
Aeromexico, but acknowledged receiving money from Prevoisin. It
claimed he raised the claim as part of a ``strategy'' to beat the
fraud charges.
	   The airline had filed suit in Texas and Colorado in efforts to
seize a condominium in Vail, Colorado, that de Prevoisin owned.
	   De Prevoisin headed the group formed to privatize Aeromexico
until he was forced out in December 1994. The airline and its
subsidiaries handle about 40 percent of Mexico's air traffic.
	   In June, Mexican officials won extradition from Spain of Angel
Rodriguez Saez, who built a financial empire during Mexico's
banking privatization of the early 1990s but who fled Mexico in
1994 when officials seized his bank, Banpais. He was charged with a
dlrs 4 million fraud.
	   Still at large is Carlos Cabal Peniche, former head of Banco
Union and Banca Cremi. He is accused of swindling those banks of
hundreds of millions of dollars. He is believed to be in Europe.
	   Critics of the governing party also claim he was closely tied
with important politicians.
	   The fallout from the December 1994 crash is at the center of a
current struggle over a bank bailout fund known as Fobaproa.
	   The government is proposing to incorporate Fobaproa's
liabilities _ now about dlrs 65 billion _ as part of the national
debt. Opposition parties are demanding a probe of the bad loans
assumed by Fobaproa, claiming many went to influential and
still-wealthy businessmen.

	   BOGOTA, Colombia (AP) _ A huge rebel offensive in the run-up to
Andres Pastrana's swearing in Friday as Colombia's president has
demonstrated just how strong the leftist insurgents have become and
how difficult it will be to make peace.
	   In fighting that tapered off Wednesday, guerrillas from the two
largest rebel factions set off bombs in cities and towns, attacked
oil pipelines and a hydroelectric dam and hammered army and police
bases in about half the country with rockets, mortars and grenades.
	   The government said 68 soldiers and police were killed and 87
wounded by rebels of the 15,000-member Revolutionary Armed Forces
of Colombia, or FARC, and the 5,000-member National Liberation
Army, or ELN. Another 46 security-force members were missing, it
said.
	   In the most devastating action, rebels overran an important
southern anti-narcotics base in Miraflores, killing or dragging
away dozens of soldiers and police as possible bargaining chips.
	   The rebel commander who organized the raid, Jorge Briceno, told
reporters by two-way radio that guerrillas took more than 100
prisoners.
	   The onslaught was a rude welcome for Pastrana, who met in the
jungles of Colombia last month with top FARC leaders and agreed to
start peace talks with the 34-year-old rebel group by November.
	   ``Sometimes you have to work for peace in the midst of war,'' an
undeterred Pastrana said Wednesday.
	   Grim-faced army leaders said they repelled the offensive and
called it a military and political failure for the rebels.
Colombian military analysts disagreed.
	   ``It's the largest disaster in the history of the insurgency,
and it comes on top of an entire chain of disasters over the past
three years,'' said Alfredo Rangel, a former presidential national
security advisor.
	   In March, the rebels killed 62 soldiers and seized 43 others in
an attack blamed by army leaders on intelligence failures of the
same sort that apparently failed to anticipate this week's
guerrilla actions.
	   The 120,000-member army has been unable to counter an
increasingly bold and well-trained rebel force that has gained in
wealth and firepower in part through stepped up revenues from
ransom kidnappings and ``war taxes'' on cocaine production in
rebel-controlled areas.
	   The guerrillas have gone in recent years from occasional
ambushes of small groups of soldiers and simple harassment, to
assaults by hundreds of rebels on heavily fortified army and police
bases, such as the Miraflores base overrun on Monday.
	   The challenge for the peace-seeking Pastrana, observers say,
will be to reform and strengthen an ineffective and demoralized
military.
	   ``The guerrillas at this moment have many more cards to
negotiate with,'' said Rangel. ``They have much more bargaining
power for having carried out this demonstration of force.''

New conviction for drug gang leader
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MEXICO CITY (AP) _ One of Mexico's most notorious drug gang
leaders, Hector Palma, has received an 11-year sentence for
transporting marijuana and cocaine, adding to earlier prison
sentences, the federal attorney general's office said Thursday.
	   A judge in the Pacific coast city of Culiacan imposed the
sentence on the trafficker known as ``El Guero,'' or ``The blonde
one.'' Earlier sentences mean he is now serving 33 years at the
Puente Grande prison near Guadalajara.
	   The conviction stemmed from an incident in 1986 in which armed
men claiming to be federal police agents forced their way into a
hospital and demanded treatment for a wounded colleague.
	   Real policemen arrived and arrested the impostors and during
investigation, they confessed to working for Palma and implicated
him in drug traffic, according to the attorney general's office.
	   A verdict in the case had been delayed by injunctions obtained
by the defense.
	   Last October, prosecutors won a 19 1/2-year prison sentence
against Palma stemming from a 1988 police raid on a drug warehouse
in Guaymas, where men guarding 2,325 pounds of cocaine told police
they were working for Palma.
	   Palma was captured on June 23, 1995, after his plane crashed
near Guadalajara, 280 miles north of Mexico City. He was captured
at the home of a federal police commander and 33 police officers
were arrested for protecting him.
	   For two years, Palma repeatedly beat charge after charge and
delayed others with repeated injunctions.
	   He was cleared of involvement in a deadly 1992 shootout at a
Puerto Vallarta discotheque, acquitted of marijuana and cocaine
possession and even of the drug warehouse charges. An appeals court
last year reversed that acquittal.

Padres reacquire Randy Myers
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By BERNIE WILSON &QC; 
 &UR; AP Sports Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   SAN DIEGO (AP) _ The San Diego Padres reacquired reliever Randy
Myers on Thursday, grabbing him off waivers from the Toronto Blue
Jays to give the National League West leaders a left-handed
compliment to closer Trevor Hoffman.
	   Myers, who appeared in 66 games for the Padres in 1992, was
acquired from Toronto for minor league catcher Brian Loyd and a
player to be named. He saved 45 games for Baltimore last season
before signing with the Blue Jays as a free agent last November.
	   Myers, 35, was 3-4 with 4.46 ERA and 28 saves with Toronto.
He'll give the Padres a tough lefty set-up man for Hoffman, who
leads the majors with 37 saves.
	   ``After looking at several guys, we thought, why not go after
one of the best?'' Padres general manager Kevin Towers said.
``Having a guy like Myers pitching in the eighth and ninth, with
him and Homffan and (Dan) Miceli and (Donne) Wall, that gives us a
strong bullpen.
	   ``I think the one thing we've been looking for is a left-hander
in the bullpen. That's been one weakness we've had even since
1996,'' Towers said, referring to the year the Padres won their
second NL West title.
	   Coincidentally, Hoffman lost for the first time this season on
Thursday, allowing Rico Brogna's RBI single in the 11th inning to
give Philadelphia a 3-2 win,
	   ``With Myers and Hoffman, we have two of the better closers in
the game,'' Towers said. ``We didn't have to give up three of our
top prospects and didn't have to take away from big league club.''

Japan provides more flood aid to China
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ The Japanese government decided Friday to send
flood-ravaged China additional financial support amounting to U.S.
dlrs 500,000, the Foreign Ministry announced.
	   Additionally, Japan will also send tents, water purifiers and
electricity generators totaling 49.4 million yen (dlrs 342,000),
the ministry said.
	   Japan already provided dlrs 700,000 in financial support and
material assistance worth 29.5 million yen (dlrs 204,000) last
month, the ministry said.
	   The latest aid comes as the death toll from China's devastating
summer flood season has officially passed 2,000. The massive floods
have affected, to varying degrees, 240 million people, or a fifth
of the population, according to the Chinese government.

Davenport, Williams advance in Toshiba Classic
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: will be UPDATED &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   CARLSBAD, California (AP) _ Lindsay Davenport and Venus Williams
stormed through their opening matches Thursday to advance to the
quarterfinals of the dlrs 450,000 Toshiba Tennis Classic.
	   Davenport, the No. 2 seed, dispatched Lisa Raymond 6-1, 6-4
while the third-seeded Williams slugged out a 6-3, 6-2 victory over
Chanda Rubin in second-round matches.
	   Davenport and Williams each received first-round byes.
	   In another second-round match, eighth-seed Nathalie Tauziat of
France advanced with a 6-2, 3-6, 6-1 victory over Amy Frazier.
	   Davenport will face Tauziat on Friday in a rematch of their
Wimbledon quarterfinal this year, won by Davenport.
	   Davenport rolled through the first set, but fell behind 4-2 in
the second and was serving in the seventh game.
	   ``I think that was a big game,'' she said. ``Obviously, she was
on a roll there and I was struggling.''
	   Davenport held serve, then broke Raymond's serve twice.
	   ``I think it was OK,'' Davenport said in rating the level of
play. ``It wasn't very high. ... I just think there were a lot of
errors.''
	   Davenport, 22, is coming off her second title this season, a
three-set victory over Williams on Sunday in the Bank of the West
Classic at Stanford, Calif.
	   Like Davenport, Williams was not pleased with her play.
	   ``I think I was a little bit inconsistent today, making some bad
choices at times,'' she said. ``Chanda is a strong player and makes
good decisions.''
	   Williams faces unseeded Mary Pierce of France on Friday in the
quarters. Pierce advanced Wednesday with a three-set victory over
No. 5 seed Conchita Martinez of Spain.
	   After the players traded early service breaks in the first set,
Rubin trailed 4-3 and was serving. Williams finally converted on
her third break point of the game with a half-volley backhand to
lead 5-3.
	   Williams closed out the set when she ripped a backhand winner
down the line.
	   The second set proved to be much easier for Williams, who used
consecutive service breaks to take a 5-2 lead.
	   Williams, 18, went off to practice after her match.
	   ``I just think that we weren't both on top to our games,'' she
said. ``I just managed to play the big points and the ad points
better.''

	   MINNEAPOLIS (AP) _ Jeff King's two-run homer in the ninth inning
provided the final turn in a wild game and gave the Kansas City
Royals an 8-7 win over the Minnesota Twins on Thursday.
	   King, who also had two doubles, lined a one-out pitch from Rick
Aguilera (3-7) to left field for his 21st homer following a walk to
Dean Palmer. That came after Marty Cordova's two-out, two-run
single in the eighth had given the Twins a 7-6 lead.
	   The win was the sixth in seven games for the Royals, who
completed their first three-game sweep since May 1996 at
California. Kansas City moved past Minnesota into second place in
the AL Central for the first time since May 7.
 &UR; Mariners-Tigers rained out
	   In Detroit, the game between the Seattle Mariners and Detroit
Tigers was postponed by rain and will be made up as part of a
doubleheader on Friday.
	   Seattle's Jeff Fassero (10-7) and Detroit's Seth Greisinger
(1-6), who were scheduled to start Thursday, will start Friday's
opener. In the second game, Jamie Moyer (8-8) will go for the
Mariners against Brian Moehler (12-7).

Vietnam again devalues currency
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   HANOI, Vietnam (AP) _ Vietnam effectively devalued its currency
by about 7 percent Friday, the fourth cut in the last year as the
government continued its go-slow approach to avoid the precipitous
plunges that have ravaged other Asian countries.
	   The devaluation was part of a two-step move that began late
Thursday when the State Bank of Vietnam narrowed the trading band
within which the dong can trade from 10 percent to 7 percent.
	   On Friday morning, the bank set the target rate at 12,998 dong
to the dollar from 11,815 on Thursday, making the new floor 13,907.
The dong has been constantly trading at the low mark of the trading
band all year.
	   Immediate reaction was confusion. Analysts have been predicting
another cut was imminent for months, but many still were caught
off-balance by the state bank's moves.
	   One trader said just after trading opened Friday that the prices
were ``crazy'' and that no one was quoting rates.

Connors victorious in Sprint PCS Champions tennis
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   WELLESLEY, Massachusetts (AP) _ Jimmy Connors continued his
domination of long-time rival Guillermo Vilas Thursday to move into
the quarterfinals of Sprint PCS Champions senior tennis tournament.
	   The tournament's top seed, Connors downed Vilas 6-2, 6-4 to
avenge a loss to the Argentine at the tour's Delray Beach, Florida
stop in February.
	   ``We've been doing this for so long,'' said Vilas, who has
beaten Connors only once on the senior circuit. ``What you saw
tonight was pretty much the way it used to be.''
	   In other matches, John Lloyd defeated Shlomo Glickstein 6-1,
6-2; Eddie Dibbs stopped John Fitzgerald 2-6, 6-0, 10-6 and Johan
Kriek downed Jose Luis Clerc 4-6, 7-5, 10-5.

Braves smother Reds; Mets edge Giants
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   ATLANTA (AP) _ Greg Maddux pitched a three-hitter for his fifth
shutout and Andruw Jones homered twice.
	   Maddux (15-5) walked none and struck out six for his 199th
career victory. The four-time Cy Young Award winner has 28 career
shutouts and 89 complete games, including nine this season.
	   The right-hander lowered his ERA to a major league-leading 1.53,
and needed just 92 pitches to finish the shutout in a tidy 2 hours,
5 minutes.
	   Jones gave the Braves a 1-0 lead in the second inning with a
homer off Mike Remlinger (6-12). It was Jones' fourth homer and
seventh hit in 12 career at-bats against Remlinger, who allowed
three runs and seven hits in six-plus innings.
	   Jones' second homer came off John Hudek in the eighth. Andres
Galarraga added his 34th for the Braves.
 &UR; Mets 9, Giants 8
	   In New York, Jose Mesa walked home the winning run for the
second time in three games, giving the Mets a victory over the San
Francisco Giants.
	   The Mets, whose bullpen blew a four-run lead in the eighth
inning by giving up two three-run homers, rallied with a run in the
eighth and two in the ninth.
	   The Giants had been 49-0 when leading after eight innings.
	   New York hit four home runs and moved within 2 1/2 games of the
idle Chicago Cubs in the National League wild-card race. John
Olerud homered and extended his hitting streak to 20 games for the
Mets.
 &UR; Rockies 5, Pirates 1
	   In Pittsburgh, Dante Bichette hit his 200th career home run as
the Colorado Rockies beat Pittsburgh 5-1 on Thursday, keeping
Pirates starter Jason Schmidt winless in 12 consecutive starts.
	   Schmidt (8-9) is 0-8 since he became the National League's first
eight-game winner on June 1. He has the longest losing streak by a
Pittsburgh pitcher since Jose DeLeon lost 11 straight decisions in
1985. He allowed four runs, three earned, in seven innings.
	   Bichette's 17th homer came after Neifi Perez singled in the
seventh.
 &UR; Expos 9, Dodgers 0
	   In Montreal, Jeremy Powell combined with two relievers on a
two-hitter and rookie Terry Jones homered and drove in four runs
Thursday as the Expos pounded former teammate Carlos Perez in a win
over the Los Angeles Dodgers.
	   Powell (1-1) allowed only a one-out single to Trenidad Hubbard
in the first and a leadoff single to Eric Young in the sixth _ his
last inning _ in getting his first major league win.
	   Powell, who struck out three and walked one, has allowed one
earned run in 12 innings over his two starts.
	   Mike Maddux pitched two perfect innings and Anthony Telford
pitched the ninth for Montreal's third shutout of the season.
 &UR; Phillies 3, Padres 2, 11 innings
	   In San Diego, Rico Brogna's RBI single in the 11th inning off
San Diego closer Trevor Hoffman gave Philadelphia a win and snapped
the Phillies' season-high, seven-game losing streak.
	   The Phillies avoided their second three-game sweep at San Diego
this season and handed Hoffman his first loss of the year.
	   Scott Rolen led off the 11th by doubling to left on an 0-2
pitch. Brogna initially attempted to bunt but fell behind 0-2, then
singled to right.
	   Hoffman (3-1), who leads the majors with 37 saves, had pitched a
perfect 10th. The right-hander hadn't lost since July 11 of last
season at Colorado.

Death toll rises in South Korean floods

<TEXT>
	   SEOUL, South Korea (AP) _ Floods sweeping across the Seoul
metropolitan area left at least 119 people dead and 53 others
missing Friday in South Korea's worst natural disaster in years.
	   With flood waters receding, tens of thousands of people returned
to sodden, mud-caked homes. Hundreds found only shattered remains.
Low-lying suburbs were littered with broken furniture, overturned
cars, dead animals and other debris.
	   Health authorities warned against outbreaks of diseases.
	   Since last weekend, landslides and flooding have claimed a total
of 183 lives and left 85 people missing in South Korea. After
triggering flash floods that killed dozens of campers in a southern
national park, a storm front moved north and dumped up to 62
centimeters (25 inches) of rain around Seoul late Wednesday and
early Thursday.
	   Rain-swollen rivers overflowed, breaking dikes, sweeping away
roads, homes, vehicles and telephone poles and triggering deadly
landslides, including one that killed 10 soldiers.
	   Some 29,000 homes were submerged, leaving 20,000 people
homeless. Some 22,300 hectares (55,000 acres) of farm land was
covered by dark brown flood water.
	   ``Flood waters are retreating fast and people are returning
after spending overnight at schools. But the damage was far greater
than we first expected,'' said Park Hun, an official at the Home
Ministry's Disaster Relief Headquarters.
	   President Kim Dae-jung ordered tax breaks for flood victims.
Television stations and newspapers launched campaigns to collect
relief donations.
	   Thousands of soldiers and police waded into receding flood
waters to search for missing people. Helicopters moved rescue gear
to the sites of landslides.
	   In a riverside resort town north of Seoul, relief workers
working overnight recovered eight bodies from mudslides that
covered bungalows and shops. They were searching for 15 more
believed missing and feared dead.
	   Hardest hit were Uijongbu, Paju, Dongduchon and Kanghwa,
satellite cities west and north of Seoul. The rains flooded some of
the tributaries of the Han River, which bisects the capital, and
the Imjin River, which flows along the border with North Korea.
	   An unknown number of land mines were uprooted and swept away
along a portion of the demilitarized zone separating South and
North Korea. The region was declared off limits. As many as a
million mines are believed strewn along the DMZ as a military
deterrent.
	   The death toll was the worst since 1987 when a typhoon claimed
nearly 350 lives.

Padres reacquire Randy Myers
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: ADDS background &QL; 
 &UR; By BERNIE WILSON &QC; 
 &UR; AP Sports Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   SAN DIEGO (AP) _ The San Diego Padres reacquired reliever Randy
Myers on Thursday, grabbing him off waivers from the Toronto Blue
Jays to give the National League West leaders a left-handed
complement to closer Trevor Hoffman.
	   Myers, who appeared in 66 games for the Padres in 1992, was
acquired from Toronto for minor league catcher Brian Loyd and a
player to be named. He saved 45 games for Baltimore last season
before signing with the Blue Jays as a free agent last November.
	   Myers, 35, was 3-4 with 4.46 ERA and 28 saves with Toronto.
He'll give the Padres a tough lefty set-up man for Hoffman, who
leads the majors with 37 saves.
	   ``After looking at several guys, we thought, why not go after
one of the best?'' Padres general manager Kevin Towers said.
``Having a guy like Myers pitching in the eighth and ninth, with
him and Homffan and (Dan) Miceli and (Donne) Wall, that gives us a
strong bullpen.
	   ``I think the one thing we've been looking for is a left-hander
in the bullpen. That's been one weakness we've had even since
1996,'' Towers said, referring to the year the Padres won their
second NL West title.
	   Coincidentally, Hoffman lost for the first time this season on
Thursday, allowing Rico Brogna's RBI single in the 11th inning to
give Philadelphia a 3-2 win,
	   Because the trade happened after the July 31 trading deadline,
the waiver process came into play where teams can block proposed
deals. No AL teams submitted a claim for Myers, and when the
process went through the NL in the reverse order of the standings,
the Padres submitted a claim.
	   The Padres originally got Myers from Cincinnati on Dec. 8, 1991,
for Bip Roberts. After going 3-6 with 38 saves and a 4.29 ERA in
1992, Myers was allowed to leave as a free agent as the Padres
began a salary purge.
	   Myers has pitched in the playoffs four times, including in the
1990 World Series for the Reds, when he saved one game.
	   Loyd, 24, was originally drafted by the Padres in the fifth
round of the 1996 draft. He was hitting .305 with four home runs
and 35 RBIs at Rancho Cucamonga in the California League.

	   CALCUTTA, India (AP) _ In the world's largest demonstration
marking the day the first atomic bomb was dropped, 250,000 people
jammed the streets of Calcutta to show they don't want a similar
tragedy to befall South Asia.
	   The huge protest against India's decision to go nuclear was a
sign that Indians' initial euphoria over the May nuclear tests has
been tempered by the sobering impact of economic sanctions and
heightened tensions with Pakistan.
	   Celebrities and writers joined a throng of factory workers and
students in a three-mile march in Calcutta. ``We don't want the
bomb! We want peace!'' the crowd chanted Thursday as it assembled
in a Calcutta sports stadium.
	   Smaller antinuclear demonstrations were held throughout India.
``Bread, not bombs!'' shouted demonstrators in New Delhi, where
spiraling food prices and electricity shortages have dampened the
early enthusiasm for the bomb.
	   The demonstration was the largest on the day commemorating the
53rd anniversary of the world's first atomic bombing. In Hiroshima,
Japan, 50,000 people clasped hands in prayer and observed a moment
of silence at 8:15 a.m. _ the exact time the United States dropped
the bomb that devastated their city Aug. 6, 1945. Peace activists
in Oak Ridge, Tennessee, noted the World War II anniversary with a
demonstration outside the Y-12 nuclear weapons plant that supplied
uranium for the bomb.
	   In Pakistan, which followed India into the nuclear age with
tests of its own, only a few hundred people joined protests in the
three largest cities, Islamabad, Lahore and Karachi. The smaller
size of the demonstrations reflected most Pakistanis' belief that a
nuclear bomb is their only defense against their more powerful
rival, India.
	   Calcutta was a natural focus for antinuclear sentiment. It is
the capital of West Bengal, a state led for 20 years by communist
governments that often has been out of step with the rest of India.
But rallies like those held Thursday in Bombay and New Delhi, even
by just a few hundred people, would have been unthinkable in the
initial rush of nationalist pride over the tests.
	   The risks were brought into focus last week by the collapse of
efforts to revive India-Pakistan peace talks, and by a weeklong
artillery barrage that killed 120 people on both sides of the
disputed border in Kashmir.
	   Pakistan's ambassador to India, Ashraf Jehangir Qazi, warned the
border duel was especially worrying because it was ``destabilizing
the situation in a nuclear context.''
	   India's Defense Ministry said heavy artillery in the Himalayan
region fell quiet for the first time in a week Thursday, although
Indian and Pakistani troops traded sporadic small-arms fire.
	   The rivalry between the two countries has led to three
conventional wars in the past 50 years, and the subcontinent is
considered the world's most likely nuclear flashpoint. Two of the
three wars have been over Kashmir.

Kiwis threaten to pull out of British tour
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   AUCKLAND, New Zealand (AP) _ Coach Frank Endacott said Friday
the New Zealand Rugby League should consider canceling its British
tour if English clubs refuse to release Kiwi players for two tests
against Australia.
	   ``I'm with Gerald (league president Gerald Ryan) in the view
that we shouldn't tour Britain and play three tests if they refuse
to release our players to the test team,'' Endacott said.
	   ``If things continue this way, we'll end up in the same
situation as the English Rugby Union and the sort of mess they have
up there.''
	   English clubs have already stated they will refuse to release
Richie Blackmore and the two Paul brothers Henry and Robbie for the
Australia-New Zealand tests on Oct. 9 in Brisbane and a week later
at Albany, Auckland.
	   New Zealand is scheduled to play three tests in Britain at the
end of October and the first week of November.
	   Ryan said Friday he had been trying for months to drag Australia
and Britain to an International Rugby League board meeting to
ratify its procedures and its priority over domestic competitions
in England and Australia.
	   ``We've called for a meeting in Sydney on August 18 and 19 and
as far as we are concerned that meeting has to go ahead,'' Ryan
said.
	   ``The British and Australia have been dragging their heels on
this and we're in a position now where we need to get the status of
the international board sorted out.
	   `It is just not good enough when we have the English dictating
to us because of their club competition. We've tried to be
accommodating and they just keep riding over the top of us.''
	   Ryan said he would have no hesitation in keeping the New Zealand
players home.
	   ``You get to a point where you have to make a stand,'' he said.
``I have some militant people on my board and they're all for
calling off the tour if we aren't allowed to pick our best players.
	   ``Personally I say we should play both Australia and Britain
even if they refuse to release players because I believe we would
still beat them. But somewhere along the way you've got to draw a
line and say enough is enough.'' (djp)

China begins evacuating 300,000 people in last-ditch measure
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By JOHN LEICESTER &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   BEIJING (AP) _ China was evacuating more than 300,000 people
Friday from land along the raging Yangtze River that could be
sacrificed to flooding in a desperate bid to safeguard areas
downstream.
	   With the Yangtze at record levels and threatening to rise
further, officials were preparing to divert floodwaters along a
section of the 6,300-kilometer- (3,900-mile-) long river described
as the most dangerous.
	   A decision whether to deliberately flood towns and villages in
the Yangtze's Jingjiang section in central Hubei province would
require the approval of the State Council, or Cabinet.
	   ``The worst moment of the year's flood control efforts is
probably coming,'' the newspaper China Daily quoted unidentified
Yangtze River officials as saying.
	   The crisis was precipitated by a surge of floodwaters headed
down river toward the Jingjiang dikes Friday. Officials fear the
flood tide _ the river's fourth this year _ could cause sodden
levees weakened by weeks of rain and floods to collapse.
	   The last time the Yangtze was this high was in 1954, during
floods that forced officials to divert water three times. More than
30,000 people died in the flooding that year.
	   So far this year, more than 2,000 people have died in summer
floods that began in June. The death toll continues to rise as
reports are received from flooded areas.
	   More than 500,000 people live in the area south of Shashi in
Hubei province that could be flooded, and more than 300,000 were
already being moved out, said an official at Hubei's Anti-Flood
Office. The remainder live on high ground and are safe, said the
official, who refused to give his name.
	   The decision whether to divert the Yangtze still hadn't been
taken, he said. He said officials had ``many other'' flood control
options that could be used first, but he refused to say what they
were.
	   Gong'an county, south of Shashi, would bear the brunt of
flooding if officials decided to divert the Yangtze at Jingjiang,
the China Daily said.
	   ``The Jingjiang section is facing the worst flood challenge in
its history,'' the newspaper quoted Ge Shouxi, a Yangtze River
chief engineer, as saying.
	   Officials first disclosed that they were considering opening the
Yangtze's levees at a government press conference Thursday.
	   ``The possibility of flood diversion cannot be discounted,''
said Zhao Chunming, a deputy director at the State Flood Control
and Drought Relief Headquarters. ``Preparations have already been
made.''
	   ``We will try our best not to divert water unless it is
absolutely necessary,'' he added.
	   Other officials at the news conference, however, were more
hopeful.
	   ``According to the situation now, it doesn't look like we need
to divert water,'' said Zhou Wenzhi, a vice minister of water
resources. ``But we have to make these preparations.''
	   Main Yangtze dikes have held firm, but some secondary levees
have already collapsed, inundating swathes of farmland. Some were
deliberately abandoned to take the pressure off major levees, said
Zhao. Other secondary dikes could also be abandoned if main Yangzte
dikes are endangered, he said.
	   Hubei, among the worst hit provinces, declared a state of
emergency Thursday, the official Xinhua News Agency reported. It
said that with water levels expected to rise further, provincial
authorities issued a ``do or die'' order to local residents to help
safeguard major cities and levees.
	   Rains in parts of Hubei and neighboring Jiangxi province in July
were seven times heavier than normal. Flooding has also caused
serious damage in northeastern China, in central Shaanxi province,
and in southern Guangdong and Guangxi.

Dollar higher, Japanese stock prices rise in early trading
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ The U.S. dollar edged higher against the yen Friday
morning prior to a policy speech by the Japanese prime minister
later in the day. Tokyo stock prices rebounded in light trading.
	   The dollar bought 144.84 yen, up 0.17 yen from late Thursday in
Tokyo and above its late New York rate of 144.32 yen overnight.
	   Currency trading was subdued as dealers awaited Prime Minister
Keizo Obuchi's inaugural policy speech to Parliament, slated for
1:00 p.m. (0400 GMT).
	   In the speech, market participants were looking for signs the
government would move quickly to lead Japan out of its worst
recession in decades.
	   But the speech was not expected to include much market-moving
news.
	   Obuchi was expected to detail his plans for more than 6 trillion
yen (dlrs 41.6 billion) in tax cuts to stimulate Japan's economy.
	   On the Tokyo Stock Exchange, share prices bounced back on the
strength of an overnight rise on Wall Street.
	   The Dow Jones industrial average closed at 8,577.68 on Thursday,
up 30.90.
	   The 225-issue Nikkei Stock Average rose 86.87 points, or 0.55
percent, to 15,963.09 points at the close of the morning session.
On Thursday, the Nikkei index closed down 115.94 points, or 0.72
percent.
	   But trading was quiet as ``most investors are waiting for
Obuchi's speech,'' said Kunihiro Hatae, general manager of the
stock division at Tokyo Securities.
	   The Tokyo Stock Price Index of all issues listed on the first
section was up 2.16 points, or 0.18 percent, to 1,229.25. The TOPIX
closed down 8.69 points, or 0.70 percent, the day before.
	   Meanwhile, the yield on the benchmark No. 182 10-year Japanese
government bond rose to 1.220 percent from Thursday's close of
1.215 percent, driving its price down to 111.64 yen from 111.68 yen
Thursday.

Killer of royal family member released as part of Northern Ireland
</HEADLINE>
peace deal

<TEXT>
	   DUBLIN, Ireland (AP) _ The man who murdered the much-loved
great-uncle of Prince Charles _ the only member of the royal family
to be killed during the 30-year Northern Ireland conflict _ has
been freed under the controversial early release provisions of the
region's peace settlement.
	   Thomas McMahon was a serving a life sentence for the murder of
Lord Louis Mountbatten and four others who died when the Irish
Republican Army blew up his private boat in Mullaghmore, western
Ireland, in August 1979. He was released from prison Thursday night
under the terms of the Good Friday peace agreement.
	   Jeffrey Donaldson, a member of Parliament for the Protestant
Ulster Unionist party, condemned the decision to free McMahon.
	   ``Once again the release of this notorious killer is another
indication of the premature manner in which both the Irish and
British governments are approaching the release of terrorist
prisoners,'' Donaldson said. ``Many will view this release as yet
another major concession to the IRA.''
	   The promise of paroles for members of truce-observing groups was
the most controversial part of the agreement struck in April among
the British and Irish governments and eight Northern Ireland
parties, including the IRA-allied Sinn Fein.
	   McMahon has been released temporarily on an almost weekly basis
for the past two years as part of a pre-release program agreed by
the Irish government. He was one of the longest-serving prisoners
in Ireland.
	   Northern Ireland is to release several hundred pro-British
Loyalists and anti-British republicans from prison there in the
next two years. The first six IRA prisoners were released last
Saturday.
	   Excluded from the program are convicts of four Northern Ireland
splinter groups _ three anti-British, one pro-British _ that oppose
the peace process.
	   ``Even Sinn Fein admit the IRA war is not over, yet both
governments continue with the release of prisoners in spite of
ongoing violence from republicans, including the IRA,'' Donaldson
said.
	   The IRA has maintained a truce since July 1997, but IRA
dissidents have been blamed for several attacks and attempted
attacks since the peace agreement was reached, including a foiled
plot to bomb London last month.

Company raided for allegedly exporting sensitive gear to China
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ Police raided the offices of an electronic device
manufacturer on Friday, looking for evidence the company may have
played a role in exporting to China equipment that could be used to
build nuclear weapons.
	   Investigators entered the Tokyo headquarters of Hitachi
Electronics Ltd. on suspicion the company violated Japan's export
control laws through its role as manufacturer of the sensitive
devices, a Hitachi spokesman said.
	   Police had previously raided the company in May to build a case
against the wholesaler that exported the equipment. Friday's
investigation was designed to gather evidence against Hitachi
Electronics, Japanese media reports said.
	   Beyond confirming the raid, Hitachi Electronics had no comment
on the investigation, said a company representative, who spoke on
condition of anonymity.
	   Hitachi Electronics, is an affiliate of the consumer electronics
giant Hitachi Ltd. The company makes broadcasting and
communications equipment and also measurement systems.
	   The wholesaler, Tokyo-based Ryokosha allegedly exported
precision measuring devices to China in December 1996 without
approval from the trade ministry.
	   Japan's trade law requires that companies receive official
approval before exporting any equipment that could be used to
develop weapons.
	   When used with lasers, the instruments are capable of measuring
in microns, or millionths of a meter, and are included on the trade
ministry's list of devices that can be used to produce nuclear
weapons, Japanese newspapers have reported.
	   A spokesman for the Tokyo Metropolitan Police refused to comment
on the case.
