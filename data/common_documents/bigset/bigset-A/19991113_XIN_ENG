<HEADLINE> Security Council Calls for Peaceful End to Burundi </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, November 12 (Xinhua) -- The U.N. Security
Council Friday adopted a presidential statement, calling on all
parties to put an end to the violence and negotiate a peaceful
solution to the current crisis in Burundi.
</P>
<P>
The presidential statement was adopted at an open Security
Council meeting after the recent outbreak of violence in Burundi
and the delays in peace process.
</P>
<P>
"It calls on all the parties to put an end to this violence and
pursue negotiations towards the peaceful resolution of Burundi's
ongoing crisis," the statement said.
</P>
<P>
The Security Council reiterated its support for the Arusha
Peace Process and for the efforts to build an internal political
partnership in Burundi, the statement said.
</P>
<P>
"The states of the region, in close consultation with the
United Nations, need to act quickly to appoint a new mediation
team that is acceptable to the Burundi parties to the
negotiations," the statement said.
</P>
<P>
"The Security Council commends those Burundian parties,
including the Government, that demonstrated their commitment to
continue negotiations, and calls on those parties that remain
outside the process to cease hostilities and calls for their full
participation in Burundi's inclusive peace process," the statement
said.
</P>
<P>
The Security Council, in the presidential statement, urged
all parties to ensure the safe and unhindered access of
humanitarian assistance to those in need in Burundi and "to
fully guarantee the security and freedom of movement of U.N. and
humanitarian personnel."
</P>
<P>
The Security Council calls on states of the region "to ensure
the neutrality and civilian character of refugee camps and to
prevent the use of their territory by armed insurgents," the
statement said.
</P>
<P>
"It also calls on the Government of Burundi to halt the policy
of forced regroupment and to allow the affected people to return
to their homes, with full and unhindered humanitarian access
throughout the process," the statement said. "It condemns the
attacks by armed groups against civilians and calls for an end to
these unacceptable incident."
</P>
<P>
At least 10,000 Burundian refugees have fled into neighboring
Tanzania so far this month, escaping a dramatic intensification of
their country's ethnic civil war, which has intensified in recent
months, reports said.

<P>
OTTAWA, November 12 (Xinhua) -- Police arrested 16 protesters
of military spending Friday in front of National Defense
Headquarters in Ottawa.
</P>
<P>
Chanting "Homes Not Bombs", the protesters demanded the
hundreds of millions of dollars in annual military spending be
better used to build homes for the homeless in the country, which
enters wintry months.
</P>
<P>
Police made the arrests after the protesters, standing hand in
hand, refused to leave and apparently attempted to get into
defense headquarters.
</P>
<P>
Canadian Defense Minister Art Eggleton on the same day
confirmed that the country would reduce its military presence in
the Balkans from the current 2,800 to about 1,800.

<HEADLINE> PNA, Israel Reaffirm Commitment to Sharm El-Sheikh </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GAZA, November 12 (Xinhua) -- Chairman of the Palestinian
National Authority (PNA) Yasser Arafat and visiting Israeli
Minister of Public Security Shlomo Ben-Ami reasserted their
commitment to going on with the implementation of the Sharm
El-Sheikh memorandum.
</P>
<P>
During their meeting held in the West Bank city of Ramallah
Friday, the two sides discussed a number of issues including the
southern safe passage and a plan on separating the Palestinian and
Israeli economies as well as the security cooperation between
the two sides, the Voice of Palestine radio reported.
</P>
<P>
The talks also dealt with the release of a third group of
Palestinian prisoners from Israeli jails before the holy month of
Ramadan (early December), the second Israeli troops redeployment
in the West Bank and the inauguration of the northern safe passage
between Gaza and the West Bank.
</P>
<P>
The talks did not touch upon Arafat's refusal to approve the
maps of the next redeployment, also called the second phase
withdrawal, scheduled for Monday as stipulated by the Sharm El
Sheikh peace deal.
</P>
<P>
The discussion of the maps and their endorsement need more
time, the radio quoted Saeb Erekat, Palestinian chief negotiator
as saying.
</P>
<P>
Arafat on Thursday refused to approve the maps, which were
ratified by the Israeli cabinet earlier Wednesday, as expected by
the Israeli government, citing the fact that they did not include
some important areas.
</P>
<P>
Under Sharm El Sheikh peace deal signed early September by
Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak and Arafat, Israel will
transfer 3 percent of the West Bank territories from Area C
(under full Israeli control) to Area B (where Palestinians
exercise administrative control) and 2 percent from Area B to Area
A (under full Palestinian control).
</P>
<P>
The lands to be transferred include 2.2 percent of the
territories east of the West Bank city of Hebron which will be
turned into a natural reserve, and other areas in the north of the
West Bank.

<HEADLINE> Zimbabwe To Issue 52 Million U.S. Dollar Treasury </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, November 12 (Xinhua) -- The Zimbabwean government
Friday announced its plan to borrow two billion Zimbabwean dollars
(52 million U.S. dollars) from the domestic market to mend next
year's budget deficit.
</P>
<P>
The Reserve Bank of Zimbabwe urged tenders for Treasury Bills
being issued on behalf of the government through a local
newspaper.
</P>
<P>
Zimbabwe operates on a budget deficit and has largely depended
on domestic borrowing to finance the difference between
expenditure and revenue.
</P>
<P>
The government debt is estimated at 67.7 percent of the Gross
Domestic Product (GDP) as at the end of June this year and at
least 29 percent of the budget is spent on paying interest on the
debt.
</P>
<P>
The current budget deficit is 7.5 percent of the GDP. Finance
Minister Herbert Murerwa expressed the hope that it could be
reduced by almost half to 3.8 percent in the next fiscal year.
</P>
<P>
Borrowing from the domestic market by the government crowds out
private investors and fuels inflation and interest rates.
</P>
<P>
Recent lending rates at about 60 percent have made money
expensive and inflation at a rate of 70.4 percent has increased
input costs for business.

RIYADH, November 12 (Xinhua) -- Saudi Ministry of Labor and
Social Affairs will deliver as of November 23 over 53 million
U.S. dollars in aid to the families of the disabled persons under
last year's decrees.
</P>

The ministry is also building rehabilitation centers for the
disabled persons to help them integrate into the society and
provides them with vacational training, El-Radadi added.
</P>
<P>
He pointed out that by means of annual financial assistances to
the families of the disabled, the ministry hopes the disabled may

<P>
ATHENS, November 12 (Xinhua) -- Greece and the U.S. will sign
agreements to strengthen their cooperation in tourism, copyright
and intellectual rights protection, natural disaster aid and
earthquake forecasting during President Bill Clinton's first-ever
visit to Greece next week.
</P>
<P>
The Athens News Agency (ANA) Friday quoted sources as saying
that Greek Foreign Minister George Papandreou and U.S. ambassador
in Athens Nicholas Burns have reached consensus on the signing of
the agreements.
</P>
<P>
A protocol on law enforcement cooperation and an agreement
regarding military facilities in Greece that are used by U.S.
forces have not been finalized and will probably not be ready for
signing during Clinton's visit, which will take place on November
19, the sources said.
</P>
<P>
The two men also decided that Clinton and Greek Prime Minister
Costas Simitis will issue a joint statement promoting bilateral
businesses' cooperation toward the Balkan reconstruction.
</P>
<P>
In a related development, Greek government spokesman Dimitris
Reppas said Friday that the Greek government has decided to take
all necessary measures so that nothing will cast a shadow over
Clinton's visit.

<HEADLINE> Tanzanian President Calls for National Unity </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, November 12 (Xinhua) -- Tanzanian President
Benjamin Mkapa Friday asked Tanzanians to rekindle their spirit to
fight any form of discrimination among them as a way of sustaining
the national unity.
</P>
<P>
Addressing the nation in Dar es Salaam to mark the end of a
month-long national mourning of the death of the founding
president Julius Nyerere, Mkapa exhorted Tanzanians to expose
those sowing seeds of discrimination.
</P>
<P>
"Now that we are starting a life minus the Father of the
Nation, each of us should give fresh priority in fighting any form
of discrimination," he said.
</P>
<P>
"We should, therefore, expose any person bent on preaching
religious disharmony, tribalism, racism, gender discrimination and
any other form of hatred," he stressed.
</P>
<P>
Mkapa said Nyerere is remembered and respected for his
painstaking efforts in forging the national unity. For the
Tanzanian people, the best way to cherish and honor him is to
sustain what Nyerere bequeathed to the nation, he said.
</P>
<P>
The nation should strive at all cost to sustain unity, peace,
tranquility, love and solidarity rather than engaging in petty
policies through shouting, the president said.
</P>
<P>
He said Tanzania is still facing a daunting task of building
economy, improving productivity and defending ideals of freedom
and unity.
</P>
<P>
Mkapa announced the 30-day mourning period on October 14 when
Nyerere died of blood cancer in a London hospital.
</P>
<P>
Since then, all flags have been flying at half mast and
Tanzanians have been mourning the revered old man in different
ways.

<HEADLINE> Clinton Signs Bill Reshaping U.S. Financial Industry </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, November 12 (Xinhua) -- U.S. President Bill Clinton
Friday signed into law a sweeping measure that lifts
Depression-era barriers and allows banks, securities firms and
insurance companies to merge and sell each other's products.
</P>
<P>
"This is a day we can celebrate as an American day," Clinton
said, referring to the bipartisan support the legislation had on
Capitol Hill. He said the legislation is both a victory for free
markets and a victory for consumer protection.
</P>
<P>
Congress passed the measure on November 4, opening the way for
the emerging of more bigger financial "supermarkets" selling
loans, investments and insurance. Proponents had pushed the
legislation in Congress for two decades, and Wall Street and the
banking and insurance industries had poured millions of dollars
into lobbying for it in the past few years.
</P>
<P>
Americans spend an estimated 350 billion U.S. dollars annually
on fees and commissions for banking, brokerage and insurance
services. Proponents say the legislation will save consumers some
15 billion dollars each year, offering them greater choice and
convenience and spurring competition.
</P>
<P>
Consumer groups and other opponents maintain it will bring
higher prices and jeopardize consumers' financial privacy.
</P>
<P>
Clinton said he believed the privacy protections "have teeth,"
but expressed reservations about whether they go far enough. He
directed his economic advisers to study the proposal and recommend
additional legislation for Congress to address next year.
</P>
<P>
"I want to make sure every family has meaningful choices about
how their personal information will be shared within corporate
conglomerates," Clinton said. "We cannot allow new opportunities
to erode old and fundamental rights."
</P>
<P>
The overhaul measure is one of the few major pieces of
bipartisan legislation to emerge from the Republican-controlled
Congress this year.
</P>
<P>
In a statement after passage, Clinton said the measure "will
help the American financial services system play a leading role in
propelling our economy into the 21st century, continuing the
longest peacetime economic expansion in our history."
</P>
<P>
"Eliminating barriers to financial services competition will
allow American companies to better compete in the global economy,"
he said.

UNITED NATIONS, November 12 (Xinhua) -- The U.N. Security
Council Friday called upon leaders of the Somali factions and all
others concerned to cooperate constructively and in good faith in
the efforts to resolve the crisis in the northeastern African
country.
</P>
<P>
The appeal came as the 15-member Security Council adopted a
presidential statement at the end of an open meeting.
</P>
<P>
"The Security Council expresses its full support for the
efforts exerted by the Intergovernmental Authority on Development
(IGAD) to find a political solution to the crisis in Somalia," the
statement said.
</P>
<P>
The president of Djibouti, in his September 23 letter to the
president of the Security Council, put forward some proposals
aimed at restoring peace and stability in Somalia and looked
forward to their finalization at the forthcoming IGAD Summit.
</P>
<P>
"The Security Council expresses its grave concern at the
increasingly evident effects of the lack of a functioning
central government in Somalia," the statement said.
</P>
<P>
The Security Council"expresses its deep distress over reports
that the absence of law and order in the country is attracting
criminals and subversives."
</P>
<P>
It urges all States to contribute generously to the appeals of
the United Nations to ensure continued relief and rehabilitation
efforts in all regions of Somalia, including those aimed at the
strengthening of civil society, statement said."
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the Security Council "strongly reiterates its call
upon all States to observe the arms embargo imposed by
resolution 733," and "to refrain from any actions which might
exacerbate the situation in Somalia," the statement said.

Talks on the two tracks have been stalled since the hard-line
Israeli former Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu came to power in
June, 1996.
</P>
<P>
But, hopes for the resumption of the talks are raised after
Israeli Labor leader Ehud Barak ousted Netanyahu from the office
in June, this year.
</P>
<P>
Lebanon and its ally Syria are demanding a simultaneous
Israeli withdrawal from Syrian Golan Heights and south Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
Israel captured the Golan Heights in the 1967 Middle East war
and has refused to return it to Syria.
</P>
<P>
It set up a self-declared security zone in south Lebanon in
1985 with the claimed aim of protecting its north from Lebanese
guerrillas' cross-border attacks.
</P>
<P>
Vedrine said his country has been supporting an unconditional
Israeli pullout from south Lebanon but hopes it will be achieved
within the framework of an agreement with Lebanon as well as with
Syria.
</P>
<P>
Barak has repeatedly vowed to pull Israeli troops out of
Lebanon before next July 7 with or even without a deal with
Syria.
</P>
<P>
Talking of the issue of Palestinian refugees in Lebanon, the
minister said any peace between Palestine and Israel without
considering Lebanon's interest will not be lasting and
comprehensive.
</P>
<P>
The refugee issue does not only concern the two countries,
therefore it should be settled through a multi-side negotiation,
Vedrine added.
</P>
<P>
As Barak has expressed his refusal to allow Palestinian
refugees to return to their lands, Lebanon, home to 350,000
Palestinian refugees, fears that their permanent settlement will
break the country's delicate sectarian balance, a main reason for
the 1975-1990 civil war.
</P>
<P>
Vedrine came here in the morning from Damascus where he held
lengthy talks with Syrian President Hafez al-Assad.

<HEADLINE> NATO Air Force Several Times Stronger Than Russia's: Russian Commander </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, November 12 (Xinhua) -- NATO's joint air force is
several times stronger than Russia's in the western part of the
country, Russian Air Force Commander-in-Chief Anatoly Kornukov
said Friday.
</P>
<P>
The correlation of air forces between NATO and Russia in the
west of the country is 7:1 in quantity and 4:1 in quality, the
Interfax news agency quoted Kornukov as saying.
</P>
<P>
According to Kornukov, at the time of the Soviet Union's
disintegration in 1991, it had a fleet of over 10,000 aircraft. In
1992 Russia inherited 62 percent of that fleet.
</P>
<P>
"Calculations indicate that with poor financing the fleet may
have shrunk by over 25 percent," he said.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the network of airdromes was slashed by 50 percent
after 1991, while 40 percent of the remaining airfields "are in
critical condition and require fundamental repairs," Kornukov said.
</P>
<P>
By contrast, he said, the combat component of NATO may have
increased from 48 to 62 ground divisions at the expense of Hungary,
Poland, the Czech Republic and Slovakia. The joint NATO air fleet
may have grown by 17 percent and the helicopter fleet by 13
percent.
</P>
<P>
In addition, NATO has 285 well-equipped airdromes, he said.
</P>
<P>
Citing the approaching of a powerful NATO force toward the
Russian border, Kornukov said the Russian Air Force needs to boost
its financing by at least 10 percent to keep it in due shape.
</P>
<P>
"Under present conditions and in the foreseeable future, Russia
's national security and defense cannot be guaranteed without a
strong air force," he warned.

<HEADLINE> Chretien Suggests Canada Reduces Military Presence in Kosovo, Report Says </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
OTTAWA, November 12 (Xinhua) -- Canadian Prime Minister Jean
Chretien suggests Canadian soldiers be pulled out of Kosovo by the
spring of 2000, the Ottawa Citizen reported Friday.
</P>
<P>
Chretien writes in a letter dated November 8 to Defense
Minister Arthur Eggleton, "It is clear that we cannot sustain the
present level of Canadian Forces involvement in both Kosovo and
Bosnia beyond next summer.
</P>
<P>
"I do not see the requirement to maintain any significant
Canadian Forces presence in Kosovo beyond the spring of 2000."
</P>
<P>
The prime minister suggests that Canada should concentrate on
its "contribution to NATO operations" on Bosnia, according to the
Citizen, which said it had obtained a copy of the letter.
</P>
<P>
The number of Canadian troops in the Balkans will be reduced
from the current 2,800 to about 1,800, the daily newspaper said.
</P>
<P>
The country had approximately 1,300 troops in Kosovo after U.S.-
led NATO air strike against Yugoslavia on March 24, according to
earlier reports.
</P>
<P>
The Citizen estimates the annual cost for Canadian troops
currently deployed in Bosnia is 200 million Canadian dollars (
about 136 million U.S. dollars).
</P>
<P>
NATO defense ministers already decided to cut down troops in
the Balkans in their Toronto meeting in September, including the
reduction of the NATO army in Bosnia from 30,000 to 21,000.
</P>
<P>
The Canadian prime minister discussed "the presence of the
Canadian troops" in the Balkans on November 1 with visiting NATO
Secretary-General Lord Robertson, who, instead, urged Canada to
spend more on military modernization.
</P>
<P>
The Canadian forces have been reported too much stretched with
a record 4,400 soldiers sent abroad on 22 missions, while the
country's total army forces have been reduced to 60,000.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Retail Sales Remain Unchanged in October </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, November 12 (Xinhua) -- U.S. total retail sales in
October were unchanged at a seasonally adjusted 252.5 billion
dollars, the Commerce Department reported Friday.
</P>
<P>
Retail sales fell by 0.1 percent in September. The figure was
revised downward from a previous estimate of 0.1 percent gain.
</P>
<P>
Retail sales have climbed or held steady most months of this
year and last month were 8.5 percent higher than October 1998. The
resilient U.S. economy, unemployment at a 29-year low of 4.1
percent and tame inflation have helped to give the nation's
retailers a strong year.
</P>
<P>
But there have been some signs that the economy may be slowing.
Consumer confidence has fallen in the last four months, home sales
are down and consumers are using their credit cards less freely.
</P>
<P>
While consumer spending, which accounts for two-thirds of all
economic activity, rose at a solid annual rate of 4.3 percent in
the July-September quarter, it was down from 5.1 percent growth in
the second quarter.
</P>
<P>
Friday's report showed that sales of new cars and trucks at
automobile dealerships fell by 1.6 percent in October, following a
2 percent decline the month before. Still, the auto industry is
heading toward a record year of sales in 1999.
</P>
<P>
If excluding the volatile autos category, retail sales rose a
brisk 0.5 percent in October, stronger than the 0.3 percent gain
many analysts were expecting.
</P>
<P>
Sales at furniture and home furnishing stores also fell in
October, declining by 0.9 percent, following a 1.8 percent gain
the month before. And, sales at general merchandise stores, which
includes department stores, went down by 0.1 percent after a 0.9
percent gain in September.
</P>
<P>
Sales at hardware and building supply stores rose a strong 1.7
percent last month, up from a 1.3 percent decline in September.
</P>
<P>
Sales at apparel and accessory stores also were up, rising 0.9
percent in October, following a 1 percent drop the month before.
Sales at bars and restaurants rose 0.8 percent, after a 0.6
percent gain in September. Drug stores also reported a strong 1.4
percent increase in sales following a 0.8 percent gain the month
before.
</P>
<P>
Sales at gasoline stations rose 0.3 percent as gasoline prices
dropped sharply last month.

<P>
BEIRUT, November 12 (Xinhua) -- At least three Lebanese
civilians were wounded Friday in a fighting between Lebanese
guerrillas and Israeli troops in south Lebanon, security sources
said.
</P>
<P>
One woman was injured by shrapnels of a shell landing near her
house in the village of Houla in the western sector of the Israeli
occupied zone in south Lebanon
</P>
<P>
Two other civilians were slightly hurt in the attacks on the
village of Jarjua inside the zone by the pro-Israeli South Lebanon
Army (SLA).
</P>
<P>
Earlier in the day, four SLA fighters were wounded when their
outposts in Sujud and Arab Salim came under mortar fires by
Lebanese guerrillas.
</P>
<P>
The Iranian-backed Hezbollah, or Party of God, has claimed
responsibility for the attacks, which were the heaviest in recent
weeks.
</P>
<P>
In response, Israeli warplanes blasted Hezbollah's suspected
hideouts inside the zone by firing missiles on villages and hills
accompanied by artillery fire.
</P>
<P>
Israel set up a self-declared security zone in south Lebanon
in 1985 with the claimed aim of protecting its north from
Lebanese guerrillas' cross-border attacks.
</P>
<P>
Since then, Lebanon's resistance movement spearheaded by
Hezbollah has been fighting to oust Israelis and its ally SLA out

<HEADLINE> Romania Cuts Power Delivery to Republic of Moldova </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BUCHAREST, November 12 (Xinhua) -- Romanian electricity utility
Conel Friday stopped its electric power supply to the Republic of
Moldova, reported the official Rompres News Agency.
</P>
<P>
"At the latest meeting we had with the representatives of the
Moldovan government, we reached no understanding regarding the
recouping of debts. Under the circumstances we stopped supplying
electric power to that country," said Conel General Manager Tudor
Serban.
</P>
<P>
Serban said that Moldovan authorities gave no concrete solution
to the recouping of about 13 million U.S. dollars. "We did not ask
them to give all the money in one tranche. We proposed that the
debt be rescheduled or that we be given oil for the money. But no
understanding could be reached in either respect," continued the
Conel manager.
</P>
<P>
Earlier reports said that the decision to cut the electricity
supplies was actually made by Industry and Trade Minister Radu
Berceanu, soon after Moldova's Sturza cabinet was dismissed on
November 9 by a no-confidence vote in parliament.
</P>
<P>
The minister argued that Romania had the right to desist the
contract as early as October 15 due to Moldova's delayed payment
of its debts, but it had counted on the Chisinau cabinet's
promises.
</P>
<P>
"Now we no longer have partners for a dialogue, so I have
decided to stop the electricity supply in keeping with the
contract provisions," Berceanu explained.
</P>
<P>
Power stations in Moldova produce only 20 percent of the power
needed by the country. Romania and Ukraine deliver about 50
percent of its power requirement. Conel began exporting
electricity to Moldova last December.

<HEADLINE> German Parliament Passes Schroeder's Austerity Plan </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BONN, November 12 (Xinhua) -- Germany's lower parliamentary
house, the Bundestag, Friday in Berlin passed Chancellor Gerhard
Schroeder's ambitious austerity program for year 2000 after
heating debates.
</P>
<P>
The bill of so-called "Budget Consolidation Law" was passed
with 328 votes in favor and 252 against. After being effective, it
will cut Germany's budget by 14.2 billion marks in the next year
and 17.2 billion in year 2001.
</P>
<P>
It will freeze the salary standard of Germany's public
servants, lower social welfare and pensions paid on behalf of the
unemployed, and cut 7.4 percent off the across-the-board
ministerial budgets.
</P>
<P>
Totally, the sparing package aimed at overhauling Germany's
federal finances foresees more than 150 billion marks in cutbacks
over the next four years.
</P>
<P>
Friday's vote in the Bundestag has long been expected as a key
test for Schroeder, whose popularity has slumped in recent months
after his Social Democrats (SPD) had lost a string of local
elections. Schroeder has been hurt in opinion polls amid wide
opposition both in and outside his party.
</P>
<P>
Since the SPD and its junior governing partner, the Greens
party, have lost majority in the upper house of parliament, the
Bundesrat, Schroeder's Finance Minister Hans Eichel deliberately
designed the bill so that only the a small part must win approval
of the Bundesrat.
</P>
<P>
About 10 of the 14 billion marks in cuts will go straight into
law, while the remaining four billion marks, including cuts in
housing allowances and lower pay increases for public workers,
require approval from the upper house.
</P>
<P>
The Bundesrat is comprised of delegates from Germany's 16
federal states. Schroeder's "red-green coalition" lost control of
the upper house as a result of its defeats in state elections
earlier this year.
</P>
<P>
The upper house will discuss the four billion marks in cuts
with colleagues of the Bundestag on December 2 and then vote
before the end of the legislative year on December 17.
</P>
<P>
The plan has sparked widespread protests. Last month, tens of
thousands of police, teachers and other civil servants
demonstrated against it in Berlin.

<HEADLINE> U.N. Survey Team Begins Work in Congo (K) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, November 12 (Xinhua) -- A United Nations survey
team began work Thursday in the Democratic Republic of Congo to
pave the way for the deployment of the remaining U.N. military
liaison officers authorized by the Security Council, U.N.
officials said here Friday.
</P>
<P>
The 16-member technical team is surveying conditions on the
ground throughout the east African country following two rounds
of negotiation between U.N. Special Envoy Mustapha Niasse and
President of Congo (K) Laurent Kabila.
</P>
<P>
The team's findings would form an essential foundation for the
planning of the second phase of the U.N. Mission, a U.N. spokesman
said.
</P>
<P>
After a day in the northern town of Gbadolite, the U.N.
officials are scheduled to travel to Goma, Kisangani, Bukavu and
Kananga -- all but Kananga in rebel-held territory. Goma is
headquarters of the Rwandan-backed faction of the Congolese Rally
for Democracy.
</P>
<P>
The U.N. Security Council authorized the deployment of 90
military liaison officers to Congo (K) following a ceasefire
agreement in July to end the war in the African country.
</P>
<P>
The team, which arrived in Kinshasa on October 20, will
assess the logistical needs of a U.N. peacekeeping force, and
associated humanitarian work. It has no mandate to look at the
military situation on the ground or ceasefire violations,
diplomats said.
</P>
<P>
The U.N. peacekeeping force is part of a deal that Kabila and
his allies -- Zimbabwe, Angola and Namibia -- signed in Zambia's
capital Lusaka on July 10 with Rwanda and Uganda, which back
rebels, who took up arms agains Kabila in August 1988 and now
control the east and port of the north of Africa's third largest
nation.
</P>
<P>
The rebels signed the peace accord in August. All sides
alleged truce violations, reports said.

State Minister of Tourism, Wild Life and Antiquities Jovina
Akaki called for more investment in order to revitalize the

foreign tourists were killed in Bwindi Forest Park in early March

</P>
<P>
Bwindi Forest Park, which is renowned for mountain gorillas,
accounts for some 80 percent of the country's total tourism
revenue.
</P>
<P>
Tourism is Uganda's second largest foreign exchange earner of
some 100 million U.S. dollars each year, next to coffee exports.

<HEADLINE> U.N. Calls for More Action to Slow Spread AIDS </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, November 12 (Xinhua) -- The head of the Joint
United Nations Program on HIV/AIDS (UNAIDS) has called for
political commitment and timely action to slow the spread of the
number one killer disease in the Caribbean, U.N. officials said
here Friday.
</P>
<P>
"We don't yet have a vaccine for HIV/AIDS but we do have a
'social vaccine'," Dr. Peter Piot, the executive director of
UNAIDS, told the Tenth National Health Forum in Santo Domingo, the
Dominican Republic, Thursday.
</P>
<P>
"This consists of social moblization to increase awareness and
promote tolerance and solidarity with people living with HIV/AIDS,
promotion of safe sex, and sex education and life skills training
in and out of shool for young people," he said.
</P>
<P>
Piot also suggested action to address the needs of the most
vulnerable populations and said that efforts to prevent the
transmission of HIV, the virus that causes AIDS disease, from
mother to child should be intensified.
</P>
<P>
Action will require partnership and political commitment, Piot
said. "Governmental leadership and commitment, together with
supprt from civil society and the international community, and
solid collaboration among all the players -- this is the formula
for success."
</P>
<P>
The Caribbean now has more than 330,000 HIV-positive people,
UNAIDS said. The U.N. agency says that the situation is
particularly alarming since HIV is spreading in the region at a
rate second only to sub-Saharan Africa.

<P>
BONN, November 12 (Xinhua) -- Javier Solana, coordinator of
European Union (EU)'s common foreign and security policy, Friday
said a delegation of OSCE would soon be sent to Chechnya.
</P>
<P>
After his talks with German Chancellor Gerhard Schroeder in
Berlin, Solana said Moscow was ready to accept the delegation as
Russian Foreign Minister Igor Ivanov had assured him at their
meeting Thursday evening in Helsinki.
</P>
<P>
"That is a very important decision," Solana told reporters at a
press conference.
</P>
<P>
The EU has entrusted the delegation of Organization for
Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE) with three missions:
humanitarian help for refugees in Chechnya, political dialogue
with Russian authorities, and effort to de-escalate the military
conflicts, Solana said.
</P>
<P>
"This conflict (in Chechnya) has no military solution," he
stressed.

<HEADLINE> Clinton Says Support Indonesia's Fight against </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, November 12 (Xinhua) -- President Bill Clinton on
Friday offered support to Indonesia's fight against corruption,
but stopped short of embracing President Abdurranhman Wahid's plan
to pardon the former president if he is convicted of stealing from
the government.
</P>
<P>
Speaking before meeting with Wahid in the Oval Office, Clinton
said he generally favors the steps Wahid had taken toward reform.
"We ought to support anything he is trying to do to build
democracy and take Indonesia into the future," he said.
</P>
<P>
Wahid said if former President Suharto were convicted of
stealing billions of dollars, a pardon would be in order because
Suharto ruled for such a long time and retains a large base of
support.
</P>
<P>
"It's not easy, because Mr. Suharto still has big followers,"
Wahid said. "So we have to be careful not to, as we say, topple
the cart."
</P>
<P>
Clinton said a pardon for Suharto, who was forced to end his
32-year rule last year after a wave of protests and riots shook
Indonesia, was a matter for the Indonesian government and its
people to decide as they seek to "resolve tensions" and recover
from financial crisis.
</P>
<P>
Clinton invited Wahid to congratulate him on his election
victory and to express support for the democratic transformation
in Indonesia.
</P>
<P>
Wahid arrived in Washington on Thursday on a private visit
that will include medical treatment for an eye condition.

<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, November 12 (Xinhua) -- Kenya's tea output in the
first nine months of 1999 slumped by 20 percent to 173.47 million
kilograms compared to 217. 09 million kilograms in the same period
last year.
</P>
<P>
Africa Tea Brokers (ATB) Friday said that production in
September was 21. 34 million kilograms as against 22.04 million
kilograms in the same month last year.
</P>
<P>
Dry weather was the leading culprit for the decrease throughout
this year.
</P>
<P>
Local observers said the production in September was mainly
hampered by low temperatures and hailstorms in the major
tea-growing areas of the country.
</P>
<P>
Last month, the Kenya Tea Board (KTB) projected the country's
tea output this year at 235 million kilograms compared to 294
million kilograms last year when production was boosted by heavy
El Nino rains.

<HEADLINE> China Backs Resumption of Arusha Peace Process for </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, November 12 (Xinhua) -- China Friday voiced its
support for the resumption of the Arusha peace talks and other
efforts to promote peace process in Burundi.
</P>
<P>
The statement came as Shen Guofang, acting permanent
representative to the United Nations, took the floor at an open
Security Council meeting which was designed to discuss the latest
development in Burundi.
</P>
<P>
"The Chinese delegation supports efforts to re-start of the
Arusha peace talks and promote of the peace process, and
appreciates the contributions to this end by countries concerned,"
Shen said.
</P>
<P>
"Recently, the situation in Burundi is disturbing: conflicts
continue to take place, the Arusha peace talks has come to a
stalemate, the untimely death of the mediator, Julius Nyrere,
further complicated the situation," he said.
</P>
<P>
Poverty and the lack of security has led to the massive exodus
of refugees, and further worsened the humanitarian situation in
the country, he said.
</P>
<P>
The murder of U.N. personnel in the country has reduced the
U.N. activities inside the country, he said. "We condemn such an
act of the killing of the innocent, and hope the Burundian
Government to take measures and to enhance the security protection
for the international assistance personnel as soon as possible in
order to resume the assistance activities and improve the
humanitarian situation."
</P>
<P>
"It is widely concerned that the 1994 tragic Rwanda massacre
will re-occur," he said. "The Chinese side believes that even
though the situation in Burundi has not reached a point of crisis,
the international community, and the U.N. Security Council in
particular, should learn from the lessons in the past, and should
give it a full attention before the situation deteriorated to the
point of no-return."
</P>
<P>
"Timely measures should be taken to promote the peace process,"
he said.
</P>
<P>
"We are pleased to note that the United Nations, in cooperation
with parties concerned, is actively undertaking diplomatic efforts
to save the peace process," he said.
</P>
<P>
"We hope that a new mediator acceptable to all parties can be
found as soon as possible so as to continue to lead the Arusha
peace talks," he said.
</P>
<P>
"We also like to reiterate that a negotiated political
settlement is the only way to restore peace and reconciliation,
any military means can only make the achievements made so far turn
into a waste and the Burundian people will suffer again," he said.
</P>
<P>
"Arusha peace negotiations are at a critical juncture, the
various parties in Burundi should cease hostilities and return to
the negotiation table and reach an agreement at an early date in
the spirit of reconciliation," he said.
</P>
<P>
"Poverty is the root cause of unrest, the instability of
Burundi's political situation is directly associated with the bad
economic situation," he said.
</P>
<P>
A point to be stressed is that the peace and stability in
Burundi can not be achieved without the peace and stability in the
Great Lakes region in Africa, he added.

<HEADLINE> U.N. Chief Concerned About Car Rocket Attacks </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, November 12 (Xinhua) -- The United Nations
Secretary-General Kofi Annan expressed Friday deep concern about
the car rocket attacks and explosions in Islamabad, Pakistan.
</P>
<P>
A statement release here said the U.N. chief, who is now in
Tokyo for an Asian tour, said that the secretary-general was
deeply concerned about the attacks, which were reportedly targeted
at U.S. and U.N. offices.
</P>
<P>
Six rockets were launched in the attacks. Police said that a
Pakistani guard near the American Center was injured by shrapnel.
</P>
<P>
No one has claimed responsibility for the attacks so far.
</P>
<P>
The U.N. chief reiterated his condemnation of all acts of
terrorism wherever they may occur, the statement said.
</P>
<P>
He appealed to the authorities in Pakistan to make every effort
to bring the perpetrators of "these cowardly terrorist attacks" to
justice.
</P>
<P>
"In view of recent demonstrations in Afghanistan and the attacks
against United Nations offices in Kandahar on November 10, the
secretary-general appeals to all concerned, especially the Taliban
authorities, to guarantee the safety and well-being of all United
Nations personnel," the statement said.
</P>
<P>
It was noted that the late morning attacks came two days before
U.N. sanctions backed by the United States were to go into effect
against Afghanistan's ruling Taliban movement for not
surrendering terrorism suspect Osama bin Laden.
</P>
<P>
The United States has condemned the attacks and not ruled out
the Taliban in the blast. However, the supreme leader of the
Taliban, Mullah Mohammad Omar, has also condemned the attacks.

<HEADLINE> Islands Issue Should Be Solved Peacefully: UAE </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ABU DHABI, November 12 (Xinhua) -- A senior official of the
United Arab Emirates (UAE) reiterated on Friday that the long-time
dispute between UAE and Iran over three Gulf islands should be
solved by peaceful means.
</P>
<P>
The dispute over the islands of Abu Musa and Greater and
Lesser Tunbs should be settled through either negotiations or
referral to the International Court of Justice in the Hague, Dubai
Crown Prince and UAE Defense Minister General Sheikh Muhammad Bin
Rashid al-Maktoum told a group of editors-in-chief of local and
Arabic newspapers.
</P>
<P>
The three islands, located near the strategic shipping lanes in
the Gulf, are claimed by both the UAE and Iran but occupied by
the latter.
</P>
<P>
Muhammad said that there is complete harmony within the UAE on
the approach to solving the islands issue. "It is President
Sheikh Zayed Bin Sultan Al-Nahyan who makes decisions and draws
out our internal and foreign policy," he added.
</P>
<P>
However, the official stressed that the UAE and Iran must work
together to maintain security in the region.
</P>
<P>
"It is our destiny to deal and co-exist with the Iranian
people on the basis of good neighborliness and historical bonds
and within the framework of (mutual) keenness to maintain
security and stability of the region," he said.
</P>
<P>
On the Middle East peace process, Muhammad noted that Israel
must implement all the accords it signed with the Palestinians
and observe related U.N. resolutions.
</P>
<P>
If Israel is serious about achieving just and comprehensive
peace with the Arabs, it should withdraw its troops from the Golan
Heights, West Bank, Gaza Strip and South Lebanon, he said.
</P>
<P>
He said that Dubai, as an emirate of the UAE, was not opposed
to moves by the Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) countries to
establish a common customs tariff for fear that its trade might be
affected.
</P>
<P>
The interest of Dubai and the UAE is part of the GCC
interest. Dubai, however, has a reasonable point of view which
should be considered, he said.
</P>
<P>
The six GCC nations, namely the UAE, Saudi Arabia, Kuwait,
Oman, Qatar and Bahrain, set March 1, 2001 as the target date for
a customs union to come into force. Dubai, however, reportedly
will stick to its particularly low tariffs to protect its trade
status.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Says Russia's Criticism "Baseless" </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, November 12 (Xinhua) -- The United States said
Friday that Russian Defense Minister Igor Sergeyev's criticism of
Washington over Chechnya is "baseless allegations."
</P>
<P>
Earlier Friday, Sergeyev said that the United States is trying
to control the energy-rich Caspian Sea area and to weaken Russia
after the Cold War ended.
</P>
<P>
"We find Defense Minister Sergeyev's statements hard to
understand. Neither our public nor private statements nor any
actions we have taken lend any support to these kinds of baseless
allegations," State Department spokesman James Rubin said.
</P>
<P>
Washington has recently been critical of Russia's tough policy
on fighting terrorists and rebels in Chechnya, demanding that
Moscow seek a political settlement.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. and its allies want to focus on Chechnya at the summit
of the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE)
in Turkey next week.
</P>
<P>
Insisting Chechnya is part of Russia and how to fight the
terrorists should be its internal affairs, Russia believes the
U.S. has no right to meddle on Chechnya.
</P>
<P>
"The West's policy is a challenge to Russia with the aim of
weakening its international position and ousting it from
strategically important regions of the world, above all the
Caspian region, the trans-Caucasus and Central Asia," Sergeyev
said.
</P>
<P>
In response, Rubin said the U.S. recognizes Russia's rights to
protect itself.
</P>
<P>
"We do recognize Russia's territorial integrity and right to
protect itself and its citizens. We share Russia's interest in
stability and security in the North Caucasus, and the ability for
all citizens to enjoy a normal life," Rubin said.
</P>
<P>
"No one benefits from instability in the North Caucasus,
neither Russia nor the United States nor the neighboring states of
the region," he added.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Rubin said the U.S. is going to "closely monitor"
the reported deployment of Russia's bombers in Cuba or Vietnam.
</P>
<P>
A Russian military weekly quoted a senior Russian military
official as saying that Russia may fly nuclear-capable strategic
bombers to Cuba and Vietnam next year.
</P>
<P>
"We don't have information of our own to confirm their
intentions as described in the report," Rubin said.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Says Rocket Attack in Islamabad Well-Coordinated </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, November 12 (Xinhua) -- the United States said on
Friday that it believed explosions of seven rockets near the U.S.
embassy, the American Center and other sites in Pakistan were
well-coordinated and no group, including Afghanistan's Taliban
movement, would be ruled out in probing the attacks.
</P>
<P>
"We cannot rule out anybody until this investigation
continues," State Department spokesman James Rubin said.
</P>
<P>
The rockets exploded early on Friday near the U.S. embassy, a
U.N. building, an American cultural center and government
buildings in Islamabad, pakistan's capital. At least six people
were wounded, but no Americans were hurt, a U.S. official said in
Islamabad.
</P>
<P>
A U.S. intelligence official said that the attacks appear "to
have been inspired by the threat of U.N. sanctions."
</P>
<P>
The U.N. Security Council has requested the Taliban to hand
over Saudi-born Osama bin Laden, who the United States alleged to
be behind last year's bomb attacks on U.S. embassies in Africa, or
the Taliban-controlled Afghanistan would face sanctions, which
would goes into effect on Nov. 14.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. intelligence official said the attacks in Islamabad
"could have been Taliban-inspired, or it could be some
fundamentalist responding to statements made by the Taliban or
others."
</P>
<P>
Rubin said there would be no change in the staffing of the
embassy or the American Center, but security was being enhanced.
</P>
<P>
At the White House, spokesman Joe Lockhart said the United
States would continue "to gather a much information as we can.
But at this point we have come to no conclusion on
responsibility."

<HEADLINE> Ecuador to Let U.S. Use Manta Air Base </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
QUITO, November 12 (Xinhua) -- The Ecuadoran government will
sign an agreement with the United States to concede the use of the
Manta Air Base, Foreign Minister Benjamin Ortiz announced Friday.
</P>
<P>
Ortiz told a press conference at the Foreign Ministry that the
agreement of cooperation that will last 10 years has very concrete
purposes, including air operations of detection, monitoring,
chasing and control of illegal air drug traffic activities.
</P>
<P>
The use of the installations in the Air Base of Manta, a port
city located on the Ecuadoran coast, will provide the United
States with certain benefits.
</P>
<P>
These would be the use of the air base installations for the
purposes of the agreement, as well as the right to build new
installations in it.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. government will assume the cost of the construction
and improvement of the Ecuadoran air base infrastructure. The U.S.
aircraft will use only this military base and not any other
airports in the country.
</P>
<P>
The United States will transfer to Ecuador at the end of the 10
years the use of the installations built or modified in connection
with the agreement, after consultations between the two countries.
</P>
<P>
Ortiz said that the two countries have a common and cooperative
plan to fight drug traffic. Ecuador and the United States are
making a deal to cooperate and exchange information on the matter
of the agreement.
</P>
<P>
The agreement says that the capture of aircraft involved in the
illegal traffic of drugs can only be made by the Ecuadoran public
force.
</P>
<P>
The Ecuadoran Air Force will maintain the control of air
traffic in Ecuador in relation to the agreement and the operations
carried out by the U.S. personnel will be made according to
agreements with competent authorities of both countries.
</P>
<P>
The Ecuadoran Congress International Affairs Committee
authorized two days ago the government of President Jamil Mahuad
to sign the agreement with the United States.
</P>
<P>
A resolution passed by that committee says that the agreement
does not need the approval of the Parliament.

<HEADLINE> Ottawa Confirms Troops Cut in Kosovo </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
OTTAWA, November 12 (Xinhua) -- The Canadian Defense Department
Friday confirmed that the country would pull all but 100 of its
current 1,450 troops out of Kosovo by next spring.
</P>
<P>
Canada will cut its force in Kosovo to a token 100 troops,
while beefing up its 1,300-strong military presence in Bosnia to
1,800, according to the department.
</P>
<P>
The confirmation came after Canadian Defense Minister Art
Eggleton said Thursday that the country should bring home some
troops and "that's we're going to do."
</P>
<P>
Earlier Friday, the local Ottawa Citizen reported that Canadian
Prime Minister Jean Chretien ordered the troops pullout from
Kosovo on November 8.
</P>
<P>
Chretien wrote to Eggleton in a letter that the country "cannot
sustain the present level" of involvement in both Kosovo and
Bosnia beyond next summer.
</P>
<P>
Defense Minister Eggleton has indicated that all the other NATO
presence in the Balkan is doing the same thing. "The British are
drawing down in Bosnia," he said.
</P>
<P>
Britain last week announced that it would cut its troops in
Bosnia from 4,200 to 3,300 by the end of the year.
</P>
<P>
But Eggleton acknowledged that the country is still negotiating
the changes with its NATO allies.
</P>
<P>
During the day-long visit by NATO Secretary-General Lord
Robertson on November 1, Chretien and Robertson discussed the
presence of the Canadian troops in the Balkans.
</P>
<P>
Robertson cautioned against any drastic reduction of NATO
troops in the region. Instead, he urged Canada to expand military
spending in modernizing its armed forces.
</P>
<P>
NATO defense ministers already decided in September at their
informal meeting in Toronto that the organization would cut down
troops in the Balkans, including the reduction of its presence in
Bosnia from 30,000 to 21,000.
</P>
<P>
NATO troops in Kosovo currently number 50,000.

<HEADLINE> Bosnia Still Faces Major Problems, Official Says </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, November 12 (Xinhua) -- Bosnia still faces
difficulties in rebuilding a weak economy and resettling refugees
four years after the signing of the Dayton Peace Agreement, a
senior Bosnian official said Friday.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at the beginning of a two-day conference marking the
anniversary of the accords in Dayton, Ohio, Svetozar Mihajlovic,
co-chairman of Bosnia's Council of Ministers, said his country is
still very poor.
</P>
<P>
"There is no way we can attract foreign capital to our country
right now," he said, adding 4 million people displaced by the war
remain out of their homes.
</P>
<P>
According to an Associated Press report, after the opening
remarks, U.S. and Bosnian leaders who gathered to work on
achieving all the goals of the pact met privately to discuss
Bosnia's problems.
</P>
<P>
State Department officials said they plan to push for full
implementation of the accords but progress is uncertain.
</P>
<P>
"We're not going to make promises before a meeting that you're
going to have some sort of breakthrough here," said U.S.
Ambassador James Pardew, also a State Department advisor for
Kosovo and Dayton implementation.
</P>
<P>
Pardew said the Bosnian economy still needs to be restructured,
more refugees need to be allowed to return to their homes, and war
criminals need to be apprehended. Such topics may be discussed
during the talks.
</P>
<P>
Alija Izetbegovic, the Muslim representative in Bosnia's
three-man presidency and one of the three leaders who signed the
accords four years ago, was expected to attend the meeting.

<HEADLINE> Guangdong Reports Strong Economic Growth </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GUANGZHOU, November 13 (Xinhua) -- South China's Guangdong
Province, a pioneering province in the country' reform and opening-
up drive, generated 158.3 billion yuan (about 19 billion U.S.
dollars) in gross domestic product (GDP) in the first 10 months
this year, up 12.9 percent on a year-on-year basis.
</P>
<P>
Statistics indicate that the province's industrial sector
performed well during the January-October period, with industrial
added value increasing 13 percent to reach 60.9 billion yuan (7.3
billion dollars), and industrial production value growing 13.7
percent to top more than 220 billion yuan (26.5 billion dollars).
</P>
<P>
With a healthy economic climate, enterprises in the province
realized nearly 4 billion yuan in profits during the January-
September period, according to official statistics.
</P>
<P>
Local analysts attribute this strong economic growth to
Guangdong's increased fixed-assets investment, which stood at 43.6
billion yuan (5.2 billion dollars) for the first ten months, up 35
percent.
</P>
<P>
The government's spending stimulus policy and the province's
economic restructuring also contributed to growth, analysts say.

<HEADLINE> NATO's Kosovo War Illegal, Says British Lawyer </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, November 13 (Xinhua) -- The NATO air war against
Yugoslavia was illegal, unnecessary and a failure, according to a
pamphlet published here by the Center for Policy Studies, a
British right-wing think tank.
</P>
<P>
Referring to the Charter of the United Nations, Mark Littman,
the author of the book, said it is generally agreed that the use
of force is prohibited unless in self-defense or under the
authority of the U.N. Security Council.
</P>
<P>
Neither of the two reason was cited by the North Atlantic
Treaty Organization. The military action between March and June
was justified on humanitarian grounds, Littman said.
</P>
<P>
Littman accused the British Government of using a legal
technicality to brush aside proceedings brought against several
members of NATO by Yugoslavia at the International Court of
Justice in April.
</P>
<P>
"Given the weight of opinion and legal authority against the
NATO position, the paucity of evidence in its favor" and Britain's
"reluctance" to test its view before the International Court of
Justice, "it is difficult to avoid the conclusion that the NATO
action was illegal," Littman said.
</P>
<P>
Littman also draws attention to the cost of the war, which he
puts at 61 billion pounds(about 98 billion U.S. dollars), or "the
equivalent of 50,000 dollars for every man, woman or child in
Kosovo."

<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, November 13 (Xinhua) -- Former Russian Prime Ministers
Viktor Chernomyrdin and Sergei Kiriyenko made statements Saturday
to support current Prime Minister Vladimir Putin's presidential
race in 2000.
</P>
<P>
"My bloc may throw its support behind Prime Minister Vladimir
Putin's bid for the presidency," said Chernomyrdin, leader of Our
Home Is Russia (NDR), in an interview here.
</P>
<P>
"I have a positive attitude toward Putin's running for
presidency. We can see how he works, and it is his right as a
citizen to make such a decision. In what way is he worse than
other possible candidates?" he said.
</P>
<P>
"Naturally, a final decision will be made after the
parliamentary elections," he added.
</P>
<P>
On the same day, another former prime minister Sergei Kiriyenko,
leader of the Union of Rightist Forces, stated that his electoral
bloc will also back Putin.
</P>
<P>
The Union "will definitely put a presidential candidate forward
and it could well be Putin," Kiriyenko told a press conference in
the city of Khabarovsk Saturday.
</P>
<P>
"This decision will be made in January," he said.
</P>
<P>
Putin has realistic chances of winning the presidential polls
in 2000, and it is "not a question of personality, but of the
system itself," Kiriyenko said.
</P>
<P>
The Union will be able to collect 6 to 6.5 percent of the votes
in the December parliamentary elections and a party will be
created later on this basis, Kiriyenko said.

<HEADLINE> Death Toll In India's Cyclone-hit Orissa Rises to 9,392 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW DELHI, November 13 (Xinhua) -- The official death toll in
India's cyclone-hit east coast went up to 9,392 Saturday and is
likely to rise further as more bodies are being recovered as
waters are receding from paddy fields and debris is being cleared.
</P>
<P>
The Revenue Control Room of Orissa announced that the worst
affected Jagatsinghpur district along accounted for 8,119 deaths.
</P>
<P>
However, foreign correspondents visiting the affected areas of
the state believed that between 20,000 to 50,000 people might have
died of the calamity, the worst of the century in east India.
</P>
<P>
In a report issued Friday in London, a U.N. Disaster Assessment
and Coordination team said 2.25 million people in Orissa need food
aid immediately to survive, as all means of earning a living --
crops, livestock and fishing boats -- have been lost in the
cyclone on October 29.
</P>
<P>
There has been massive destruction of homes, health centers and
schools, said the report, the most comprehensive survey to date on
the disaster.
</P>
<P>
Ten cities of the state have totally lost their water supply,
84,000 tube wells need repair and 200,000 households need water
purification kits, the report said, adding that many affected
areas could only be reached by boat or air.
</P>
<P>
Indian Prime Minister Atal Biheri Vajpayee has set up a
high-power task force led by Defense Minister George Fernandes to
direct and coordinate all rescue, relief and rehabilitation
measures in Orissa.
</P>
<P>
Fernandes went to Orissa Friday and reviewed the relief work at
a high-level meeting with the Orissa government soon after his
arrival.
</P>
<P>
He told reporters that his task force would prepare a
comprehensive short-, medium- and long-term action plan for
rehabilitation and reconstruction of the affected areas.
</P>
<P>
The Press Trust of India (PTI) said Saturday the Orissa
government has focused on restoration work and a massive rabi crop
program in the coastal districts.
</P>
<P>
With a substantial portion of the central grant of one billion
rupees (23.3 million U.S. dollars), the first phase of house
building assistance would be disbursed next week, according to
State Revenue Minister Jagannath Patnaik.
</P>
<P>
He said the total amount spent by the state on relief measures,
including the cost of rice and materials obtained without
prepayment, exceeded the central grant of two billion rupees (46.6
million dollars).
</P>
<P>
The state required about 25 billion rupees (583 million
dollars) as central assistance for restoration and reconstruction
work on a temporary basis, he said, adding that at least 10
billion rupees (233 million dollars) should be provided
immediately for the purpose.

<HEADLINE> 20,000 Land Mines Cleared In Zimbabwe Since April </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, November 13 (Xinhua) -- Koch Mine Safe, a joint venture
 de mining firm, said here Saturday that it has cleared 20,000
land mines in northern Zimbabwe since the company began clearing
mines in April this year.
</P>
<P>
Project manager of Koch, Herman Van Der Vorm, said that his
company had cleared two million square meters on the 359-km
Chidodo to Nyamapanda mine infested stretch in north Zimbabwe.
</P>
<P>
Koch Mine Safe estimates that there are 1.9 million land mines
along the Chidodo-Nyamapanda stretch and these have maimed
thousands of people, and domestic and wild animals, the Zimbabwe
News Agency reported.
</P>
<P>
The company is a joint venture firm between a German de mining
firm Koch Munitions Bergungs and a group of local retired army
officers.
</P>
<P>
According to a Koch Mine Safe doctor, one person had been
killed and 13 others injured from April to August this year when
they were clearing land mines.
</P>
<P>
He said the firm gives mine protection safety gear and is
constantly training its workers on how they could best handle the
clearing of mines.
</P>
<P>
At the peak of the liberation war, Rhodesians planted about
three million land mines on a stretch of land from Victoria Falls
to Mlibizi and to Mukumbura area bordering Mozambique.
</P>
<P>
This was meant to create a buffer zone to curtail links between
freedom fighters and communities along the Zambezi Valley.
</P>
<P>
Rhodesians had uprooted 750,000 villagers living along the
country's northern border and most of them are now desperate to
settle on cleared land.

<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, November 13 (Xinhua) -- The goal of Russia's military
operations in Chechnya is to restore peace and the normal life of
civilians, Russian Prime Minister Vladimir Putin told U.N.
Secretary General Kofi Annan over phone Saturday.
</P>
<P>
During the 20-minute conversation, Putin briefed Annan on the
situation in Chechnya, Putin's press secretary Mikhail Kozhukhov
told journalists.
</P>
<P>
"We are prepared for a political settlement of the problem, but
not with those who posed next to the corpses of our citizens,"
Putin said.
</P>
<P>
"We understand the humanitarian problems facing the displaced
persons. The government considers it its clear duty to extend
comprehensive assistance to the forced migrants from Chechnya and
is doing this effectively," said the prime minister.
</P>
<P>
"We are open to working with the international community. We
are sure that all the moral arguments are on our side and we do
not have anything to hide," he said.
</P>
<P>
However, "our lack of action as regards to this problem would
be inconsistent with all international norms, including the U.N.
resolutions that condemn terrorism," he said.
</P>
<P>
Annan, for his part, expressed his concern about the civilians'
sufferings during the military conflict, and was "glad to hear
that Russia's aim is to restore the peace in the North Caucasus,"
Kozhukhov said.
</P>
<P>
Annan also proposed that he and Putin discuss humanitarian
problems affecting the North Caucasus during the coming OSCE (
Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe) summit in
Istanbul, Turkey.

<HEADLINE> Finding Vaccine Only Hope to Win Fight Against </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DURBAN, South Africa, November 13 (Xinhua) -- Finding an
HIV/AIDS vaccine is the world's only best hope to win the fight
against the killer disease, AIDS experts told reporters here
Saturday.
</P>
<P>
At a press conference at the sideline of the ongoing
Commonwealth summit, the International AIDS Vaccine Initiative
urged the world leaders, especially those from the industrialized
countries, to give the AIDS problem the same priority they gave to
the atomic bomb.
</P>
<P>
Victor Zonana, vice president of the international AIDS
initiative, said that his organization urges the 54-member
Commonwealth to commit more money and other resources to efforts
to find a vaccine for HIV-Aids.
</P>
<P>
There should be total commitment by both developed and
developing countries to jointly work towards a cure for AIDS,
Zonana said, adding that after such a vaccine had been found, it
should be accessible to poorer nations.
</P>
<P>
There was need for speedy action on a drive to find this
vaccine, he added.
</P>
<P>
AIDS experts at the conference further stressed the need for
the Commonwealth heads of government to take a leading role in
openly acknowledging the critical implications of HIV/AIDS and to
call for a global state of crisis on HIV/AIDS.
</P>
<P>
British Prime Minister Tony Blair Friday pledged some 37.8
million U.S. dollars cash to fight AIDS, and the Commonwealth
Medical Association Trust implored other governments to do
likewise.
</P>
<P>
South African AIDS researcher Salim Abdool Karim painted a
gloomy picture about the spread of HIV/AIDS in Africa, noting that
the problem is yet to explode in South Africa.
</P>
<P>
Sub-Sahara is reportedly leading the world with the largest
number of people living with the HIV virus.
</P>
<P>
Karim said only 0.6 percent of the sexually active South
Africans were HIV positive in 1991, but the figure rocketed to 22
percent last year.
</P>
<P>
South Africa will host an International AIDS Conference (AIDS
2000) in July next year.

<HEADLINE> Military Hardware Left by Late Regime Threatens </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOGADISHU, November 13 (Xinhua) -- Remnants of the military
hardware left by Somalia's late regime, ranging from land mines to
surface to air missiles, are continuously causing serious
fatalities and injuries.
</P>
<P>
The latest such accident took place Friday when a Russian-made
anti-aircraft heat-seeking missile, SAM-2, exploded, killing a man
and wounding several others near the airport in Ballidogleh, the
former Somalia's largest air base 90 kilometers south of capital
Mogadishu.
</P>
<P>
The missile is just one of several hundred of its kind
scattered around the country and non-properly disposed of. It
exploded when a group of young men tried to extract cobalt out of
the rocket for a possible sale in the markets.
</P>
<P>
According to one of the people in the area, the young men used
a hammer and metal scissors to uncover the aluminum shield before
using a cigarette lighter so as to soften the inner side of the
missile.
</P>
<P>
Nonetheless, the missile exploded, killing one of the boys on
the spot and wounding three others standing nearby.
</P>
<P>
The loud explosion of the missile was also heard in the nearby
Dafed town, about 10 kilometers south of Ballidogleh airport.
</P>
<P>
One of the eyewitnesses said all he could see was a large smoke
 heading to the sky towards west of Ballidgleh airport.
</P>
<P>
Many people in Dafed town got out of their houses to see what
had happened.
</P>
<P>
However, no one could understand what it was all about until
young boys had arrived from Ballidogleh airport to break out the
sad news.
</P>
<P>
Neither the survivors nor the people in the area have seen
where the missile had finally landed.
</P>
<P>
Some herdsmen said they could hear the roaring missile overhead
 still flying towards west, but could not say where it had ended
up.
</P>
<P>
This is the second case in which such missile exploded near
Ballidogleh airport so far this year.
</P>
<P>
Two teenagers died some five months ago when they hammered a
missile near the airport looking for allegedly valuable materials
inside it.
</P>
<P>
One of the boys was found smashed at a nearby tree, while the
other remains missing. Inside the Ballidogleh air base are dozens
of those missiles used by the air defense forces of the country.
</P>
<P>
There are also other explosive devices allegedly left behind
the UNOSOM forces which have been deployed in the airport during
1992-1995 when the multinational forces intervened in the country.
</P>
<P>
Similarly, there are dozens of other SAM-2 and SAM-3
heat-seeking missiles left behind by Somalia's late regime at the
outskirts of Mogadishu.
</P>
<P>
A young man was killed and two others were wounded when a
missile exploded after some youths used fire to extract what they
saw as useful materials inside the missile in 1996.
</P>
<P>
The explosives non-properly disposed of, mainly the landmines,
continuously claim lives of both human and livestock in and around
the main towns and villages where they lay in the trash collection
points and sometimes unearthed by the rains.
</P>
<P>
It is mainly children who try to play around with them and
subsequently became victims of its explosion, while the livestock
also face the same problems as they try to pass through the
heavily-mined clan borderlines for grazing.

Thirty-six people were killed while 72 other wounded in Badme
and its environs after their return to these localities following
the expulsion of the Eritrean troops early this year, Ethiopian
Herald newspaper quoted officials of Tigary State as saying.
</P>
<P>
Besides, hundreds of domestic and wild animals were also killed
or wounded by the mine explosions over the past few months,
according to the officials.
</P>
<P>
Many of the victims were rendered physically handicapped. And a
 large number of people displaced from Badme have not yet returned
to their homes for fear of the mines.
</P>
<P>
It was reported that Eritrea had laid more than 100,000 mines
in Badme before they withdrew from the region in February this
year.
</P>
<P>
Ethiopia and Eritrea have been at war since May 1998 over

BACOLOD CITY, PHILIPPINES, November 13 (Xinhua) -- China
swamped sister squad Hong Kong 12-0 in the 12th Asian Women's
Football Championship on Saturaday, booking a berth in the
semifinals with four straight wins in Group B.
</P>
<P>
Nine Chinese players scored, led by Wang Jian's hat-trick, as
the defending champs moved two games closer to bagging their
seventh straight crown without dropping a single match.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Chinese Taipei held favored DPR Korea to a 1-1 draw
for the first major surprise in nearby Iloilo City. In another
game held in the city, Vietnam Beat India 3-0.
</P>
<P>
Huang Chung Lan scored the equalizer in the 66th minute -- a
penalty kick -- then the the Chinese Taipei team held the DPR
Koreans at bay for the rest of the match in earning the tie that
boosted their chances of topping Group A.
</P>
<P>
Earlier tipped to top the group, DPR Korea ended its
preliminary round campaign with three wins and a draw. They also
qualified for the semifinals.
</P>
<P>
The result, however, looked liked a shrewd ploy by the DPR
Koreans to avoid an early collision with defending champions China,
the same squad they lost to 1-3 in the finals of the 1997 Asian
Championship in Guangzhou, China.
</P>
<P>
Now with seven points from two wins and a draw, the Chinese
Taipei team have the chance to top the group assuming they beat
India, a 0-3 loser to Vietnam in the other match by at least two
goals in their last game on Monday.
</P>
<P>
Should this happen, they would have to face the Group B leaders
China in the semifinals.
</P>
<P>
The Philippines takes on Group C pacesetter Japan Sunday at 3 p.
m.at the Iloilo Stadium in a bid to further improve its place in
this 15-team tourney.
</P>
<P>
The DPR Koreans found the defense line of the Chinese Taipei
team a tough nut to crack in earlier stages so raised the heat in
the last 10 minutes of the first half.
</P>
<P>
The gambit paid off as they had s series of attempts within a
span of three minutes, climaxing in the first goal by Kim Pol-hyui
in the 38th.
</P>
<P>
The tall midfielder, who missed a wide open shot on her first
try just outside the box, made certain of her second attempt,
slotting in the ball with her left foot after it was deflected
following a left corner kick.
</P>
<P>
Chinese Taipei's chances, on the other hand, were few and far
between in the first half.
</P>
<P>
Its only clear try came from closely marked striker Lin Chi,
whose sharp 15-yard volley in the 36th minute from the left flank
was easily caught by DPR Korean goalie Kye Yong-sun.
</P>
<P>
But the Chinese Taipei team patiently worked back into the
contest in the second half and finally found the breakthrough they
needed when DPR Korean defender Ri Aegyong tackled Lia Ying Yan
from behind in front of the penalty box.
</P>
<P>
That set up Huang for the equaliser as she feinted to the right
before calmly smashing the ball into the net.

<HEADLINE> Indonesia to Set Up Commission to Probe Officials' Wealth </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, November 13 (Xinhua) -- The Indonesian government will
soon form a commission which will be authorized to investigate the
wealth of state officials in a bid to prevent corruption,
collusion and nepotism, an official said Saturday.
</P>
<P>
Soenarko, who is charged with preparing the formation of the
body, said 100 people had been nominated to sit on the independent
commission.
</P>
<P>
"The names of the candidates, aged between 40-75, will be
published in various media so that the public can make its
comments concerning their dedication, moral attitude and
character," Soenarko was quoted by Antara News Agency as saying.
</P>
<P>
By publishing the names of the candidates in mass media, he
said, the public would be able to make a judgment on who were
eligible or worthy to join the commission.
</P>
<P>
Soenarko said the body, consisting of people from various
professions, from both the government and the community, would
start functioning on November 20.
</P>
<P>
The wealth of all government officials would be probed, he
said.
</P>
<P>
"If possible, commission members will be paid a higher salary
than House of Representatives members in order to avoid new
corrupt practices," he said.
</P>
<P>
Creation of a clean government has been one of the key demands
of the reform movement, so the setting up of the commission was a
correct action, he added.
</P>
<P>
Former president Soeharto has been accused of corruption and
abuse of power during his 32 years in power. He was forced to step
down on May 21 last year amid the country's worst political and
economic crisis in decades.
</P>
<P>
Under Soeharto, corruption, collusion and nepotism flourished
in Indonesia.

LAGOS, November 13 (Xinhua) -- No fewer than 18 persons were
declared missing within 16 days before November 10 in Nigeria's
biggest city of Lagos, the Guardian newspaper reported Saturday.
</P>

contacted their relatives, the Lagos state police said Friday.
</P>
<P>
Spokesman of the Lagos police Fabulous Enyaosah urged the

of crime, " he said.

<HEADLINE> Nigeria Needs $30 Bln to Revamp Economy: Expert </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, November 13 (Xinhua) -- Nigeria's economy would require
about 30 billion U.S. dollars in the next five years to be
revamped fully, a renowned Nigerian economist said in capital
Abuja Friday.
</P>
<P>
"We need a lot of foreign exchange to revive the economy and
all of it cannot come from the government," the Vanguard newspaper
Saturday quoted Professor Dotun Phillips as saying.
</P>
<P>
"There is no way oil alone can cope," the former
Director-General of the National Institute for Social and Economic
Research noted at an international seminar on "Support for
manufacturing: Using Agricultural Raw Materials to Boost Non-oil
Export Earnings."
</P>
<P>
According to the renowned economist, the oil sector alone
cannot provide the huge foreign exchange required to return the
nation's economy to the path of growth and the non-oil sector
should be given greater attention now than ever.
</P>
<P>
Nigerian Minister of State for Finance Jubril Martins-Kuye also
said that "a monolithic economy is not good. It is an end of the
road."
</P>
<P>
Phillips, who is also a member of the Presidential Policy
Advisory Committee, said that the industrial sector must be
encouraged to expand its operational base.
</P>
<P>
Specifically, he pointed out that industrialists should begin a
vigorous campaign aimed at developing a large domestic market even
as they explore new markets internationally.
</P>
<P>
"The administration of President (Olusegun) Obasanjo is private
 sector-friendly," Phillips said. "The days of waiting for the
government to do everything for you is over."
</P>
<P>
The economist who described production as the soul of every
economy also called on cocoa producers to make effort to add
value, by processing their products before exportation.
</P>
<P>
He urged them to insist on being appointed as members of the
re-negotiating team of the federal government in talks with the
World Trade Organization (WTO).

<HEADLINE> China's Money Supply Suits Economic Growth </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, November 13 (Xinhua) -- Financial statistics released
recently by the People's Bank of China, the nation's central bank,
show that China's money and credit supply is basically suited to
the demand of economic growth.
</P>
<P>
According to the statistics, at the end of October the
outstanding amount of broad money (M2) was over 11.5 trillion yuan,
up 14.5 percent from the same period last year, while narrow
money (M1) was up to 4.2 trillion yuan, up 15.1 percent, or 3.3
percentage points higher than at the end of last year.
</P>
<P>
A spokesman for the central bank said the accelerated growth of
M1 indicates enterprises' and residents' growing desire to hold
current deposits, which is beneficial for short-term economic
growth and for expanding domestic demand.
</P>
<P>
At the end of October, the outstanding amount of loans by all
financial institutions stood at 9.38 trillion yuan, up 12.5
percent; while deposits reached 10.59 trillion yuan, up 13.8
percent, according to the release.

<HEADLINE> Paper-cut Exhibition Opens in Chengdu </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CHENGDU, November 13 (Xinhua) -- The annual national folk paper-
cut exhibition opened in this capital of southwest China's Sichuan
Province today.
</P>
<P>
On display were 33,000 paper-cuts created by both professional
and amateur artists from China's 31 provinces and autonomous
regions, ranging in age from four to 100.
</P>
<P>
One eye-catching paper-cut is a 110-meter-long work celebrating
the return of Macao to China. This paper-cut took Tian Xiaoming, a
rural woman from east China's Shandong Province, more than two
years to complete.
</P>
<P>
The upper part has 1,999 rabbits, symbolizing the ardent wish
of the people of Macao to be embraced by the motherland. The lower
part has 2,000 dragons and 50 bouquets of flowers, each bouquet in
the design of four small dragons.
</P>
<P>
"The 2,000 dragons indicate that the year 2000 is the Year of
the Dragon in Chinese lunar calendar, while the smaller dragons
represent the Chinese mainland, Hong Kong, Taiwan and Macao. It
suggests that the reunification of the motherland is an
irreversible historical trend," Tian said.
</P>
<P>
One artist, Xie Chaowu, a rural teacher in southwest China's
Sichuan Province, provided 140 paper-cut works by his pupils.
</P>
<P>
Creating paper-cuts is a popular folk art in China, and in the
hands of a true artist a piece of paper can be turned into a wide
variety of patterns -- landscapes, flowers, birds, animals and
human figures.
</P>
<P>
Using the scissors to make a story-telling picture or an
amusing figure from paper has long been a popular pastime for
women in north China, and their creations add color to the
celebrations of festivals, weddings, and birthdays.

DHAKA, November 13 (Xinhua) -- Finance Minister Shah AMS Kibria
Saturday said that increased flow of money toward the rural areas
in recent years was changing the social scenario in villages by

<HEADLINE> Djibouti-Eritrea Relations Deteriorating </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ADDIS ABABA, November 13 (Xinhua) -- Djiboutian President
Ismail Omar Guelleh has accused Eritrea of supporting Djiboutian
rebels, saying that relations between the two countries had been
deteriorating.
</P>
<P>
They were "almost in a state of war," Guelleh was quoted by
Ethiopia's Monitor newspaper Saturday.
</P>
<P>
The Djiboutian-Eritrean relations became tense after their
border conflict broke out in early May 1998.
</P>
<P>
Djibouti, bordering with both Ethiopia and Eritrea, severed
diplomatic ties with the latter soon after Asmara accused Djibouti
of taking part of the war on Ethiopia's side.
</P>
<P>
While it has been at loggerheads with Eritrea, Djibouti has
promoted its relations with neighboring Ethiopia.
</P>
<P>
The Ethio-Eritrean conflict forced Ethiopia to channel the bulk
of its exports and imports through the port of Djibouti,
abandoning Eritrean Red Sea ports of Assab and Massawa.
</P>
<P>
During his first official state visit to Ethiopia early this
month, Guelleh met Ethiopian government leaders with the two sides
having pledged to beef up bilateral ties in various fields.
</P>
<P>
In addition to gradual economic integration between the two
sisterly countries, Djibouti and Ethiopia also vowed in their
joint communique to cooperate in securing peace and stability for
the two countries and the sub-region.

anything, lower than on a normal weekend night - a possible
reflection of the high level of policing.
</P>
<P>
A massive police operation was under way as Scotland and
England prepared to settle old scores in one of the world's most
emotionally charged football fixtures.
</P>
<P>
The high-profile policing operation in and around Hampden
stadium in Glasgow was taking place with both sides aware that the
eyes of the footballing world would be watching for any fan
misbehaviour.
</P>
<P>
The world's oldest regular international fixture was last held
at Hampden in 1989 when England won 2-0. They last met in the Euro
96 competition at Wembley, when England again won 2-0.
</P>
<P>
Violence by fans, either at today's Euro 2000 qualifier or the
return leg at Wembley on Wednesday, would be a serious setback to
England's hopes of hosting the World Cup in 2006.
</P>
<P>
Hundreds of police are being deployed in the area around
Scotland's soccer shrine, and a big intelligence operation to
prevent hooligans causing trouble has been under way since the day
the match was announced.
</P>
<P>
A total of 111 soccer thugs had been served with court orders
forcing them to report to their local police station just before
the game while others are under surveillance. Some 6,500 English
fans have tickets for the Glasgow match.

<HEADLINE> Keegan: Keep Cool or Miss Out </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, November 13 (Xinhua) -- England team manager Kevin
Keegan has warned his players to keep their discipline in the
Battle of Britain at Hampden Park - or risk missing what he
describes as "the game you always wanted to play in".
</P>
<P>
Six members of the England side will be walking a yellow-card
tightrope at Hampden Park - with another booking ruling them out
of the return clash with Scotland at Wembley next Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The need to find a winning balance between being fired-up and
keeping cool has been heightened after the appointment of Spanish
referee Manuel Diaz Vega, who has a reputation of standing no
nonsense from players.
</P>
<P>
Alan Shearer, Michael Owen, David Beckham, Paul Scholes - sent
off for reckless challenges against Sweden at the Twin Towers in
June - Martin Keown and Sol Campbell will be praying they stay out
of trouble.
</P>
<P>
Keegan said: "I think the referee is renowned for being a
disciplinarian, and we will tell the players beforehand what he is
like.
</P>
<P>
"We will be saying 'Don't be coming to us afterwards saying how
unlucky you were to miss the next game at Wembley - the game
versus Scotland you always wanted to play in'.
</P>
<P>
"The message will be that if players are going to tackle and go
to ground that they make sure they get the ball. If there is a
doubt about winning the ball then just think about things.
</P>
<P>
"It's difficult to do with the players we have got because if
you tell people like Alan Shearer, Sol Campbell, Tony Adams,
Michael Owen, David Beckham and Paul Scholes not to tackle you
might as well not play them.
</P>
<P>
"It's just getting the balance right in the same way - it is
important to get the balance right between having players hyped up
for the game but also having cool heads.
</P>
<P>
"Getting them just right is the key. Keeping 11 players on the
pitch will be a very big key for both sides, and defenders won't
want to get booked early on."

<HEADLINE> Private Business People Want Children To Pursue Education Not Business </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHANGHAI, November 13 (Xinhua) -- A survey reveals that more
than 90 percent of private business people in Shanghai prefer
their children to find a job with government, research and
education departments rather than to follow their footsteps in
becoming private business people.
</P>
<P>
Respondents are from 286 self-employed families. Of these
families only 3.5 percent of them wish their children to pursue
private business endeavors.
</P>
<P>
More than 80 percent of parents hope that their children will
become college graduates. 98 percent of parents share the view
that their success in business is not as important as their
children's future.
</P>
<P>
Some 93 percent of parents responding to the survey have a high
school education. Efforts are called for more suggestions and
instructions to help improve the education of self-employed
households in Shanghai.
</P>
<P>
Shanghai now has about 200,000 private business people who lead
a better life compared to other social groups.

<HEADLINE> Iran is Major Missile Power in Middle </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, November 13 (Xinhua) -- Commander of Iran's Islamic
Revolutionary Guards Corps (IRGC) Major General Yahya Rahim
Safavi said Iran is a major ballistic missile power in the Middle
East, the Islamic Republic News Agency reported on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
The IRGC is equipped with missile-launching vessels with a
range of over 100 kilometers, Safavi told IRNA Friday on the
occasion of the IRGC week. But he did not reveal more details
about the IRGC's equipment.
</P>
<P>
In July last year, Iran successfully tested "Shahab-3"
(Meteor-3) with a range of 1,300 kilometers, which means it can
hit targets in Israel, Saudi Arabia and United States forces in
the region.
</P>
<P>
The test aroused serious concern of regional and western
countries about Iran's capability to build weapons of mass
destruction.
</P>
<P>
Safavi said that 21 years after its formation, the IRGC has now
acquired the high power to defend the country against foreign
threats.

<HEADLINE> Egyptian, French FMs Discuss Mideast Issues </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, November 13 (Xinhua) -- Egyptian Foreign Minister Amr
Moussa began talks on Saturday with his French counterpart Hubert
Vedrine on Mideast issues.
</P>
<P>
The two ministers are expected to deal with regional and
international issues of mutual interest, with focus on the latest
developments in the Mideast peace process, the Palestinian-Israeli
track in particular, Egypt's Middle East News Agency reported.
</P>
<P>
They will also review Egypt's efforts in helping promote the
peace process and the role of France in this regard, the news
agency said.
</P>
<P>
Vedrine arrived in Cairo Friday night for a two-day visit
within a three-nation regional tour, which has taken him to Syria
and Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
France, which desires to play a role in mediating the
Arab-Israeli peace talks, keeps close coordination on the issue
with Egypt, the first Arab country to sign a peace treaty in 1979
with Israel and an active mediator between the Arab sides and the
Jewish state.
</P>
<P>
The discussion between Moussa and Vedrine will also cover the
situation in Iraq in light of the ongoing debate in the United
Nations Security Council about issues related to the economic
sanctions imposed on Iraq after its 1990 invasion of Kuwait, the
news agency added.
</P>
<P>
Britain and some other countries have proposed the sanctions be
suspended if Baghdad cooperates with the U.N. Security Council. But
Baghdad insists on lifting of the trade embargo before it resumes
cooperation with the U.N. in eliminating its weapons of mass
destruction.

<HEADLINE> Roundup: Hope For Understanding Between Bangladeshi Opposition and Government Fades Away </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DHAKA, November 13 (Xinhua) -- Any faint hope that the
government and the opposition of the country would come to an
understanding has faded away entirely since police opened fire at
an opposition procession on November 8 that injured three
opposition leaders.
</P>
<P>
The Bangladesh Nationalist Party (BNP)-led opposition alliance
enforced countrywide hartal (Strike) on November 7- 8, protesting
against the cancellation of holiday on the Revolution and
Solidarity Day and the filing of nomination papers for the city
corporation voting.
</P>
<P>
During the hartal, three people were killed, hundreds injured,
including three BNP leaders. The opposition extended the hartal to
November 9 to protest against police action on the opposition.
</P>
<P>
Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina has repeatedly called for a
dialogue between the government and the opposition. She has gone
far enough to say that "I will sit for dialogue at any time, in
any place, on any topic." But no formal proposal has been made by
the government so far.
</P>
<P>
The BNP is determined to go full speed ahead with the movement
to unseat the Awami League government. The other three opposition
parties of the alliance the Jatiya Party, the Jamaat-e-Islam and
the Islamic Oikya Jote (Islamic Solidarity Front) have
categorically declared that there is now no scope at all for
dialogues.
</P>
<P>
The opposition alliance is preparing for a summit meeting
between the leaders of the four anti-government parties. It is
likely to be held by the third week of this month.
</P>
<P>
Liaison committee members of the opposition parties have
already begun discussing how to promote unity and understanding
between the various levels of the four parties, from the
grassroots workers to central-level leaders. As soon as they have
brought some cohesion to the four-party alliance, they will form a
struggle committee to coordinate the anti-government movement.
</P>
<P>
The BNP has suggested more action programs, including a 48-hour
hartal in the last week of this month, a rail-road blockade, a
Dhaka siege program and a march towards the prime minister's
office by one million people by the first week of December.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile the government is trying to persuade diplomats from
the donor countries to act as mediators between it and the
opposition. However, observers here pointed out that even if the
diplomats had agreed to mediate, nothing positive would have
happened.
</P>
<P>
The opposition's demand is getting clearer: Quit power and give
general election. But the ruling party seemed equally adamant: No
election before the expire of the full five-year term.

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, November 13 (Xinhua) -- China's education market has
become increasingly attractive as more than 140 overseas
educational institutions will attend the China International
Education Exhibition which opened here Friday.
</P>
<P>
The exhibition, a two-phase show which will be held three days
in Beijing and another three days in Shanghai, has also lured a
great number of local visitors including students who are
interested in studying abroad and parents who want to help their
children get some information about overseas schools.
</P>
<P>
"It is a rare opportunity for us to learn about information
that may not be found anywhere else including the net," said a
woman, who gave her surname as Lin, from southern Hunan Province.
</P>
<P>
Patrick T. Fong, executive director of the U.S.-based IEF
Education Foundation, said China is a huge education market with
great potential. He expressed his hope to introduce over 4,000
American institutions of higher learning to China as well as some
middle schools.
</P>
<P>
Mary M. Kowta, director of International Student Services and
Recruitment, California State University, called China a major
target in the Asia-Pacific education market, noting that they plan
to attract more Chinese students to study in California and to
carry out cooperation projects with Chinese universities.
</P>
<P>
Some local analysts pointed out that overseas schools have been
attracted to China for the enormous potential of local families
whose bank deposits have approached 6,000 billion yuan (about 750
billion US dollars).
</P>
<P>
According to official estimates, local families plan to spend
10 percent of their deposits for the education of their children,
while the number of universities and colleges is far less than the
needed.
</P>
<P>
An official with the China International Education Exchange
Society said the Chinese government lacks the funds for the
undertaking so that non-government bodies including international
investors are encouraged to enter the market.
</P>
<P>
By the end of this June, 30 Sino-overseas joint venture
education projects have been approved by the government.

<HEADLINE> Renewed Violence Kills 51 in Maluku, Indonesia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, November 13 (Xinhua) -- At least 51 persons have been
killed and more than 2,000 houses razed over the past week in new
religious unrest in Maluku, Indonesia, according to national
newspapers Saturday.
</P>
<P>
Maluku Police spokesman Maj. Jekriel Philip said most of the
deaths occurred in Ternate, Kao and Malifud in the north of the
province.
</P>
<P>
"We already have 47 dead, 35 seriously injured and two with
minor injuries. This is the accumulated toll from the latest
clashes (in northern Maluku) from last Saturday until Thursday,"
he said.
</P>
<P>
Clashes on the island of Ambon have left four dead since last
weekend.
</P>
<P>
Philip said police had confiscated dozens of rifles, arrows and
sharp weapons while bringing the clashes in northern Maluku under
control. "We can control the situation over here. So the latest
condition is good and under control," he said.
</P>
<P>
Violence between Christians and Muslims in the spice islands
first erupted in January this year and has repeatedly flared up
since, claiming more than 500 lives.
</P>
<P>
The provincial capital Ambon has suffered extensive damage and
much of the province remains tense and deeply divided, the reports
said.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Vice President Megawati Soekarnoputri has requested
accurate data on the religious conflict in the region.
</P>
<P>
Maluku Governor Saleh Latuconsina said that when he and several
Maluku religious leaders met Megawati in Jakarta on November 9,
she asked him to submit accurate data in order to find a
satisfactory solution to the problem.
</P>
<P>
He said Megawati had received numerous requests to help solve
the religious conflict.
</P>
<P>
Asked about Megawati's plan to visit the riot-torn province,
the governor said he could not reveal the exact date of the
planned visit.
</P>
<P>
"Megawati wants more information from local people about what
has been going on in Maluku. She plans to meet with local public
figures and religious leaders," he added.

<TEXT>
<P>
TIANJIN, November 13 (Xinhua) -- Tianjin, one of China's
traditional industry bases in north China, has succeeded in
upgrading technologies in most of its State-owned enterprises with
overseas investment.
</P>
<P>
Tianjin has spent 46.44 billion yuan (about 5.6 billion U.S.
dollars) in this regard since mid-1980s. The city's industry has
attracted 4.5 billion U.S. dollars of overseas investment, more
than 90 percent of which was used by traditional State-owned
enterprises (SOEs).
</P>
<P>
Among Tianjin's 185 large and medium-sized key SOEs, 114 have
introduced the company system. Tianjin now owns not only numerous
large, competitive joint-ventures but also stock companies, and
enterprises with investment from several sources.
</P>
<P>
Consequently, the industrial added value of the city's
industrial sector has increased 37.62 billion yuan (about 4.5
billion U.S. dollars) over the past six years.
</P>
<P>
The output value produced by backbone industries, represented
by electronics, chemical industry, metallurgy, and mechanical
industry, has made up 54 percent of the city's total.
</P>
<P>
The gross output of the high-tech industries such as new energy,
new materials, electronic information, biomedicine, has risen to
today's 17.5 percent of the city's industrial output value from
five percent six years ago.

<HEADLINE> China to Commercialize Water Supply </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHIJIAZHUANG, November 13 (Xinhua) -- Shijiazhuang, capital
city of north China's Hebei Province adjacent Beijing, is trying
to commercialize water supply to deal with water shortage.
</P>
<P>
A project called China's urban water management in the 21st
century is being carried out in the city with aid from the United
Nations Development Program (UNDP) and the Australian government.
It has became the first city in China to seek ways to resolve its
water shortage through organizational reform.
</P>
<P>
The project aims to regulate water management in urban China by
reforming the administrative structure and price of water,
according to Ying Ruozhi, the project coordinator.
</P>
<P>
There has been more than one department in charge of water
supply in urban China. Taking Shijiazhuang as an example, nine
governmental departments have been involved in water management. A
medium-term and long demand and supply plan was difficult to be
worked out because there was no central administrative power.
</P>
<P>
Shijiazhuang will have one single department of water
management in the next 10 years", said Ying Ruozhi. "We have
worked out a reform plan for government consultation."
</P>
<P>
Shijiazhuang is among 30 cities in China that suffers most from
water shortage. The city's annual water consumption is 400 million
cubic meters. In order to meet that demand, the city has to
exploit 140 million cubic meters of water.
</P>
<P>
Shanghai and Shenzhen are also undertaking reform in this
regard.

<HEADLINE> Indonesia's Oil, Gas Revenue to Rise </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, November 13 (Xinhua) -- Indonesia's state revenue from
oil and gas in the 1999/2000 fiscal year ending March next year
will increase by 274 percent, Minister of Mines and Energy Susilo
Bambang Yudhoyono said.
</P>
<P>
"Assuming that the oil price is at 19 U.S. dollars per barrel
on average, the revenue from oil and gas will reach 57.3 trillion
rupiah (about 8.2 billion U.S. dollars) contributing 27 percent to
the total income in the current budget of 218.2 trillion rupiah,"
the minister was quoted by the Indonesian Observer Saturday as
saying.
</P>
<P>
Oil and gas contributed to the 1998/1999 state budget to the
tune of 50.6 trillion rupiah, 19 percent of the total income of
263.89 trillion rupiah with oil at an average price of 12.58
dollars per barrel.
</P>
<P>
In the current budget, oil and gas revenues of 20.96 trillion
rupiah were projected, assuming an oil price of 10.5 dollars per
barrel.
</P>
<P>
"Per September 1999, the revenue from oil and gas had reached
16.99 trillion rupiah, or 81 percent of the target of 20.96
trillion rupiah," the minister said.
</P>
<P>
Oil prices fell below 10 dollars per barrel earlier in the
year, but picked up in August to 19.6 dollars per barrel and
further increased to 21.95 dollars in September. The current price
is around 24 dollars and is expected to rise further in
January-February, the peak winter season during which demand
increases while world-wide stocks are reportedly depleting.
</P>
<P>
"The economic recovery in Asia is also expected to contribute
to the increasing demand," Yudhoyono said.
</P>
<P>
According to the minister, the price increase would also raise
the fuel subsidy as Indonesia also imports crude oil and other oil
products.
</P>
<P>
Oil imports in the period of January to August 1999 amounted to
1.81 billion dollars, a 76.47-percent increase over the 1.02
billion dollars imported in the same period of 1998.

in the civil organization of the Kosovo Defense Corps," he told a

ethnic democratic society and called for Albania's cooperation
toward this goal.

the Chechnya issue by the Organization for Security and

<P>
Ivanov said that there is no "humanitarian disaster" in Ingush.
He said the large part of the 180,000 Chechen people who fled
across the border are lodged with their relatives and no more than
21,000 shelter themselves in tents.
</P>
<P>
"The OSCE can play an active role in providing humanitarian aid,

Norwegian Foreign Minister Knut Vollebaek, who is also acting
chairman of the European security organization, offered to act as
mediator during his Thursday talks with Ivanov.

Maskhadov plenty of opportunities to demonstrate his willingness
to make the region tranquil, but Moscow got nothing but attacks in

SHIJIAZHUANG, November 13 (Xinhua) -- Japanese watchtowers,
common sights in China and symbols of Japan's atrocities committed
in China during World War II, are being rebuilt to woo tourists.
</P>
<P>
Wang Quanxi, a farmer in north China's Hebei province, invested
900,000 yuan (about 112,000 US dollars) to restore an old
watchtower and similar fortifications to their original appearance,
hoping that thousands of people will visit the site.
</P>
<P>
In the village where Wang lives, Japanese troops built 22
watchtowers to guard against the Chinese army in the 1940s. Many
soldiers and even villagers were fatally shot by machine-guns
perched on the towers.
</P>
<P>
Wang, 64, who got rich thanks to the market-driven economy,
said he spent so much on the tower project because people should
not forget the Nazi atrocities.
</P>
<P>
In recent years, many World War II sites across the country
have been remodeled into tourist parks to attract visitors,
especially the young people who are curious about the war.

rallied in downtown Vienna Friday evening to protest against
racism, directing the spearhead to Freedom Party leader Joerg
Haider, whose party became Austria 's second largest in the
October 3 election.
</P>
<P>
Haider was known for his previous praise of Hitler's "decent
employment policies" and calling veterans of the Nazi dictator's
Waffen SS elite troops as "men of character."

The five-hour demonstration, organized by several mass
organizations, human rights and religious groups, was featured by
slogans of "Stop Haider," and "Establish a coalition government of
different races."

At a party gathering on the same day, Haider expressed regret

Meanwhile, Austrian Federal Chancellor Viktor Klima made a
speech calling on different ethnic groups and races to work and
live together peacefully and fight racism and discrimination.

At the end of the demonstration, the organizers announced that

<P>
CHANGSHA, November 13 (Xinhua) -- China will install the world'
s most advanced Doppler Weather Radar System near the flood-prone
Dongting Lake in the lower reaches of China's mightiest river, the
Yangtze, so that more accurate weather forecasts can be made next
year.
</P>
<P>
The radar system will be connected to 48 meteorological
stations and 14 remote control devices, which can cover Hunan
Province in central China, said Chang Guogang, deputy director of
the provincial meteorological bureau.
</P>
<P>
Dongting Lake, the largest freshwater lake in China, holds a
dangerously high water level whenever a major flood hits the
Yangtze.
</P>
<P>
Chang said that the radar's ability to provide early warning
for thunder storms, hail and tornadoes, will help save at least
100 million yuan of economic losses annually for the region.
</P>
<P>
The China Meteorological Administration introduced the
technology for developing Doppler Weather Radar from the United
States in 1996. The first product was installed in east China's
Anhui Province in May this year, which issued reliable weather
forecasts before this year's flood season.
</P>
<P>
More than 100 of the weather radar devices are expected to be

<HEADLINE> EU Conference on Nordic Dimension Concludes in Finland </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HELSINKI, November 12 (Xinhua) -- A one-day EU foreign
ministerial conference on the "Nordic Dimension" policy of the EU
closed here on Friday, with all participants promising to
reinforce cooperation between the EU, its Nordic partners, Russia,
and the three Baltic states.
</P>
<P>
The document, released after the conference closed, said the "
Nordic Dimension" policy, which aims to strengthen the political,
economic and ecological cooperation among countries in the new-
concept North Europe, will help promote peace, stability,
democratic systems and sustainable development in the region.
</P>
<P>
The new-concept North Europe, according to EU officials
attending the conference, refers not only to countries on the
Scandinavian Peninsula, but also includes northwest Russia and the
Baltic states of Lithuania, Latvia and Estonia.
</P>
<P>
During the conference, the participants discussed cooperation
in areas such as telecommunications, environmental protection,
scientific research, nuclear safety and organized crimes, the
document said.
</P>
<P>
The idea of EU "Nordic Dimension" was first put forward by
Finnish Prime Minister Paavo Lipponen in September, 1997, and
later was put onto the agenda of the EU summit meeting. The EU
Vienna summit meeting in December last year formally approved the
EU "Nordic Dimension" policy.
</P>
<P>
EU Commissioner for External Affairs Chris Patten, EU High
Representative for Foreign Policy Javier Solana, Russian Foreign
Minister Igor Ivanov and representatives from the Baltic states as
well as Poland, Norway and Iceland attended the conference.

<HEADLINE> Thai Businessman Given Record 585 Years in Jail </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, November 13 (Xinhua) -- The provincial court of
Kanchanaburi in western Thailand Friday sentenced a businessman to
a record 585 years in jail for cheating people out of money with
false promises of hefty returns if they invested in the farming of
coypus.
</P>
<P>
The Nation newspaper reported Saturday that the court also
fined the company, where Suvit Vivitkhunaporn, the businessman,
worked as a manager, 58.5 million baht (1.5 million U.S. dollars)
for its role in the scam.
</P>
<P>
Suvit was arrested last year when he was accused by customers
of failing to honor deals to buy back the animal for 30,000 baht
(779 dollars) and guaranteed customers a 5,000 baht (129.8
dollars) dividend for each offspring.
</P>
<P>
Suvit and the company were alleged to have cheated many people
in Kanchanaburi and neighboring provinces by falsely promising to
buy back coypus offspring after charging high prices for adult
pairs.
</P>
<P>
Suvit and the company have been found guilty of 117 counts of
cheating and handed down the sentence and the fine, The Nation
said.
</P>
<P>
Suvit fainted in the courtroom Friday after hearing the
sentence and was sent to the provincial jail once he had been
resuscitated.
</P>
<P>
Coypus are a breed of South American aquatic rodent with an
extremely healthy appetite.
</P>
<P>
They are classified as pests by the Thai Agricultural Ministry
and those who farm them for fur-export purposes are banned from
releasing them into the wild to prevent the animals from
destroying natural vegetation.

along the southern part of the ancient city during Ming (1368-1644)
and Qing (1644-1911) dynasties, and a project to improve the road
in Zhongguancun area known as China's "silicon valley" in
northwestern part of Beijing, and the Fourth Ring-Road of the city.

<HEADLINE> Uganda Replaces Representative on JMC </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KAMPALA, November 13 (Xinhua) -- Ugandan President Yoweri
Museveni has appointed his private secretary in charge of defense
James Mugira to replace Chief of Staff James Kazini on the Joint
Military Commission (JMC) for Congo peace process.
</P>
<P>
The JMC, formed under the Lusaka agreement reached in July this
 year, is currently carrying out peace-keeping missions in the
Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC) pending the deployment of
U.N. troops. Each country involved in the DRC conflict has two
appointees to the commission.
</P>
<P>
This appointment would enable Kazini to concentrate on
combating the rebels of the Allied Democratic Forces (ADF) in
western Uganda, the New Vision newspaper Saturday quoted a
highly-placed military source as saying.
</P>
<P>
However, the unidentified officer would not say whether the
posting to the JMC followed a move by Rwanda to remove its senior
commanders from the DRC.
</P>
<P>
Kazini has been the overall commander of the Ugandan troops in
eastern DRC before he was put in charge of a military campaign
against the ADF rebels with the headquarters in Bundibugyo and
Gbadolite about a month ago. His role in the DRC has since
remained advisory.
</P>
<P>
Mugira and Major Gowa, a Ugandan military officer on the JMC,
were due to fly to Zambian capital Lusaka this weekend for talks
aimed at ending the 15-month rebellion in the third largest
African country.
</P>
<P>
After a session in Lusaka, the joint commission would sit in
Zimbabwean capital Harare for further negotiations.

<P>
LOS ANGELES, November 12 (Xinhua) -- Boeing Co., the world
largest airplane maker, said Friday that it has resumed delivery
of several commercial jet models that had been delayed to correct
faulty assembly of cockpit drip shields and cabin air ducts,
according to reports from the company.
</P>
<P>
The Seattle-based plane giant said it had replaced drip shields,
which keep moisture out of the cockpit, on "about 50" airplanes in
production, including 747, 757, 767 and 777 models.
</P>
<P>
Working with the Federal Aviation Administration, Boeing said
it had also fixed duct problems on its 737 Classic, 747, 757-200
and 767 models.
</P>
<P>
Boeing last week suspended some deliveries after discovering an
adhesive not officially approved for use on drip shields and air
ducts failed government flammability tests.
</P>
<P>
The company, however, did not detail its plans to address the
hundreds of planes already in commercial service that also contain
these faulty assemblies.

<HEADLINE> Cyprus Bans Poisonous PVC Toys </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NICOSIA, November 13 (Xinhua) -- Cyprus has banned the sale of
baby toys made of PVC (polyvinyl chloride) that has been softened
by chemicals known as phthalates, the Cyprus Mail newspaper
reported Saturday.
</P>
<P>
Cyprus' Commerce and Industry Minister Nicos Rolandis announced
the ban on Friday, which was effective immediately.
</P>
<P>
The ban made Cyprus the first European Union (EU) applicant
state to ban the toys.
</P>
<P>
According to the report, these toys leak yet-undetermined
amounts of the toxic phthalates into babies' saliva if they are
chewed over a period of time.
</P>
<P>
The EU has been mulling banning the toys "for quite some
time," but only eight of its 15 members wanted an outright ban on
them, Rolandis said.
</P>
<P>
"We are in the process of withdrawing them from the shelves of
shops. The stores have to remove them immediately," he said.
</P>
<P>
Rolandis said his ministry also contacted importers, who agreed
immediately to remove the toys from warehouse stocks, and also
issued warnings to all retailers.

<HEADLINE> Oil Output Cuts to Be Extended: UAE Minister </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ABU DHABI, November 13 (Xinhua) -- Minister of Petroleum and
Mineral Resources of the United Arab Emirates Obeid Bin Saif Al
Nasir said here Saturday that there was growing support within
major oil producing countries for an extension of oil output cuts.
</P>
<P>
"There is a lot of support on this issue and I think the
Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) will take
the right decision at its March meeting," Nasir told reporters.
</P>
<P>
Oil prices have doubled since producers inside and outside
OPEC agreed last March to cut 2.1 million barrels from daily
output.
</P>
<P>
But the organization said the average of oil prices since the
start of this year is still very low -- less than 17 U.S. dollars
a barrel -- and stockpiles are still too high.
</P>
<P>
So it may consider extending its production cutback beyond next
March when the agreement expires, analysts said.
</P>
<P>
The OPEC powers Iran and Saudi Arabia have indicated their
willingness to extend the output curbs if stockpiles remain too
high in March 2000.
</P>
<P>
Kuwait indicated on Tuesday that OPEC had agreed in principle
to an extension.
</P>
<P>
"Ideas and suggestions are being exchanged by ministers of
OPEC member countries. The organization will be capable of taking
the right decision in its March meeting," said Nasir.

<HEADLINE> Mutating AIDS Virus Prevalent in Ethiopia: U.S. </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ADDIS ABABA, November 13 (Xinhua) -- An AIDS virus, which
mutates effectively and widely, is prevalent in Ethiopia, a U.S.
professor has warned.
</P>
<P>
The Monitor newspaper Saturday quoted Max Essex, Chairman of
the U.S. Harvard AIDS Institute, as saying that the virus was
identified as HIV-1C which replicates itself fast and is difficult
to control because it mutates over a given period of time.
</P>
<P>
This type of virus, with its sub-type spreading fast in other
African countries, should be the focus of researchers working on
vaccine prototypes for trial in the African continent, Essex told
the closing session of the First International Conference on AIDS
in Ethiopia.
</P>
<P>
He said scientists and researchers must now use in their work
the prevailing African virus instead of the virus that was
prevalent in the U.S. and Europe which they have been using to
develop prototype vaccines for trial.
</P>
<P>
"Experiments based on the experience of the nature of the
(AIDS) disease in the West are no longer valid," the professor
noted.

<HEADLINE> Nanjing Railway Station Resumes Normal Operation </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NANJING, November 13 (Xinhua) -- Nanjing Railway Station in
east China's Jiangsu Province has resumed normal operation after
it was hit by a blaze yesterday morning.
</P>
<P>
The railway station has handled some 23,000 passengers, and the
ticket revenue was 1.29 million yuan (about 155,400 million U.S.
dollars) yesterday.
</P>
<P>
The fire, which broke out around 1:20 a.m. Friday from a video
chamber on the second floor in the station, killed one man who
rented a stall in the waiting hall which was completely destroyed.
</P>
<P>
Fire fighters rushed to the scene in about five minutes and put
out the blaze at around 2:00 Friday morning.
</P>
<P>
A 720-square-meter temporary waiting hall has been put up on
the station square Friday night, and another one of 1,000 sq.
meters would be completed on the square today. So, the railway
station now has larger waiting places for passengers than before.
</P>
<P>
Work continues to look for any possible deaths in the debris,
and there is still no exact number of casualties.
</P>
<P>
The cause of the fire is still under investigation.
</P>
<P>
The station, an important hub along the Beijing-Shanghai trunk
railway route, was put into use in 1968. It underwent renovations
in 1992.

<HEADLINE> Philippine President Tries to Resolve Globe-PLDT Row </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, November 13 (Xinhua) -- Philippine President Joseph
Estrada said here Saturday that he will meet National
Telecommunications Commission (NTC) officials Monday to discuss
measures on how to settle the interconnection problem between the
Philippine Long Distance (PLDT) and Globe Telecom Inc.
</P>
<P>
In a weekly radio-TV program, Estrada said that he has directed
the Department of Transportation and Communications (DOTC) to
immediately resolve the interconnection row between Globe and
PLDT, following mounting complaints from the public concerning the
poor service experienced in making calls between the two phone
networks.
</P>
<P>
"The other day I directed the NTC through DOTC Secretary Rivera
to meet with me on Monday to put an end to this row," Estrada
said.
</P>
<P>
Earlier this week, Estrada said that his decision to step into
the PLDT-Globe interconnection problem was in line with
administration's commitment to uphold the public interest and
ensure efficient telecommunications services to the people.
</P>
<P>
He said that people are made to suffer because of poor service
between the two phone networks.
</P>
<P>
For more than a week, subscribers to Globe have not been able
to contact any PLDT landline. This is the third time this year
that interconnection links between PLDT and Globe have been
impaired. The first two instances were in May and September.
</P>
<P>
PLDT said that the problem is technical as it is caused by
congestion. But it is alleged that the problem was caused by
Globe's alleged non-payment of 1 billion pesos (25 million U.S.
dollars) in access charges to PLDT. But Globe denied the missed
payment.

<HEADLINE> Britain to Mediate Between Iran and U.S.: British </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, November 13 (Xinhua) -- A British legislator has said
that Britain is ready to mediate for a possible rapprochement
between Iran and the United States, local daily Tehran Times
reported on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
"Of course the first step which we are going to take is to be a
mediator in improving the relations between the U.S. and Iran,"
Secretary of British-Iranian Parliamentary Group Peter
Temple-Morris told the daily in an interview in London.
</P>
<P>
Temple-Morris explained that London is ready to play the role
of mediation "because the United Kingdom government is eager to
see more presence of Iran in international scene."
</P>
<P>
Britain has good relations with the U.S., but it adopts
independent policies in its relations with Iran, he said, without
elaborating Britain's mediation role.
</P>
<P>
However, Iranian Foreign Minister Kamal Kharrazi recently
denied the reported British mediation between Washington and
Tehran. "There is no talk of mediation, ... the required political
will should exist in the two countries (Iran and the U.S.) in
order to speak of mediation," he said.
</P>
<P>
But he expressed welcome to "efforts" by any third country
which has close ties with the U.S. to convince Washington to
"change its hostile policies toward Tehran."
</P>
<P>
"If a country, due to its ties with the U.S., asks that
country to change its policies and conducts toward the Islamic
Republic of Iran, we welcome it," Kharrazi told the Islamic
Republic News Agency on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
He noted that such efforts should not be considered as
mediation because Iran has directly asked the U.S. to change its
policies.
</P>
<P>
The issue of Tehran-Washington ties has recently become a hot
topic in Iran after several senior U.S. officials called for
"unconditional dialog" between the two countries for normal
relations.
</P>
<P>
Some Iranian moderate figures and newspapers stated that Iran
can reconsider its relations with the U.S. on the basis of
national interest.
</P>
<P>
However, the hard-line conservatives see the issue as a taboo
since the late Iranian supreme leader Ayatollah Musavi Khomeini
labeled the U.S. "the Great Satan" and termed ties with Washington
as "useless."
</P>
<P>
On the eve of the 20th anniversary of the takeover of the
U.S. embassy in Tehran by Iranian students, Iran's paramount
leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei ruled out the possibility of a
resumption of Tehran-Washington ties.
</P>
<P>
Khamenei said the U.S. "is not honest in its alleged desire to
have relations with Iran," and that "they want relations with Iran
to dictate and impose their policy on Iran."
</P>
<P>
Iran and the U.S. severed diplomatic relations in 1980 after
the takeover of the U.S. embassy in Tehran in the heydays of the
1979 Islamic revolution.

MANILA, November 13 (Xinhua) -- Philippine President Joseph
Estrada said here Saturday that he is holding last-minute
consultations with various sectors on his choice of the new chief
of the Philippine National Police (PNP) that he will announce
Monday.
</P>
<P>
Speaking in a radio-TV program, President Estrada said he
expects to make an enlightened decision by Monday.
</P>
<P>
"I'm having a hard time making my decision. All of them are
qualified. That's why I have to consult with various sectors," he
said.
</P>
<P>
In the program, Estrada laughed off persistent speculations
that he would appoint PNP Director Panfilo Lacson to replace the
outgoing acting PNP chief, Deputy Director Edmundo Larroza.
</P>
<P>
Lacson heads the Presidential Anti-Organized Crime Task Force
(PAOCTF).
</P>
<P>
Estrada said that his choice as successor of Larroza, who is
due to retire on November 16, will come from a field of three
candidates.
</P>
<P>
But when asked whether he can come up with a decision by
Monday, the president said, "maybe you'll know by Monday."
</P>
<P>
Political analysts here said that since Estrada's popularity is
declining as a recent survey shows, the choice of a new national
police chief is very important for maintaining political stability
in the country.

<HEADLINE> Kuwaiti Paper Refutes Central Banker Over Monetary </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUWAIT CITY, November 13 (Xinhua) -- A prominent local daily on
Saturday repeated its criticism to the Governor of the Central
Bank of Kuwait (CBK) Sheikh Salem Abdul-Aziz Al-Sabah for his
conservative monetary policy, which the paper said has hurt the
national economy.
</P>
<P>
In a front-page article by its editor-in-chief, the second
time within four days, the English daily Arab Times blamed the
governor for adopting measures forcing local commercial banks to
withhold money or attract more deposits by offering high interest
rates.
</P>
<P>
According to the paper, annual interest rates has reached 17
percent on consumer loans and 20 percent on other credit, while
interest rates offered by banks to deposits some times reached 9
percent, much higher than in other countries.
</P>
<P>
As a result, the paper said, the private sector, real estate
and stock markets were harmed, which in turn promoted the
country's economic recession, although a monetary stability was in
short term achieved.
</P>
<P>
The refutation took place against a background of continuing
fall of the Kuwait Stock Exchange (KSE) index, which has hit a
year-low after the bourse closed at 1,444.4 points last Wednesday,
compared to 1,562.9 points in the first trading session this year.
</P>
<P>
The Kuwaiti government has indicated it was not poised to
intervene in the KSE operations.
</P>
<P>
Economic analysts attributed the successive downward trend in
the KSE to a lack of confidence in government policy, especially
the monetary policy, among dealers, who have been reluctant to
invest in large sums.
</P>
<P>
However, Sheikh Salem, in many statements, said that cutting
interest rates on the state currency dinar would lead to its
flight.
</P>
<P>
But the paper refuted the statements as not being "supported by
scientific facts, but a politically-motivated suggestion." It did
not elaborate.
</P>
<P>
Besides recommending that foreign experts be brought in to
review and evaluate the CBK policy, the paper went as far as
urging the central banker to step down to "make the banks work."
</P>
<P>
As the paper, along with investors in the KSE, is waiting a
"positive" response from Sheikh Salem, analysts doubt that any
change would be made to the present CBK investment policy.

<HEADLINE> Keegan Urges England Stars to Club Together </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, November 12 (Xinhua) -- English team manager Kevin
Keegan challenged his England players to finally live up to their
club reputations on the international stage by seizing the
advantage in Saturday's European Championship play-off clash
against Scotland.
</P>
<P>
Keegan insists he is relaxed ahead of the first-leg encounter
at Hampden Park, Glasgow because of the talent in his side, but
after a faltering qualifying campaign so far he said: "We're due a
performance with the quality we've got."
</P>
<P>
The England coach accepts that the bottom line amid all the
hype surrounding the historic fixture is that the national side
must qualify for the Euro 2000 finals.
</P>
<P>
And having missed out on any international trophies during his
own playing career, he warned his team they must do their utmost
to ensure they add to their own array of medals at club level.
</P>
<P>
"Although we've got some of the most highly-valued players in
the world, I think we've still got something to prove on the
international stage," said Keegan.
</P>
<P>
"At the moment all those players, whether it be Alan Shearer,
David Beckham, Paul Scholes, Sol Campbell or Tony Adams, will all
feel like I did.
</P>
<P>
"Yes, they've won league championship, FA Cup and European Cup
medals and yes, they've played for England.
</P>
<P>
"But there's a void there at the moment and I had that too. I
played for England for 10 years and never won anything. Now they'
ve got a chance to do something about that.
</P>
<P>
"A lot of people feel the Champions' League has taken over from
international football and I can understand why they say it, but
it hasn't and it never will."

Just six days after the frenzied atmosphere of the north London
derby against Arsenal, which produced nine bookings and two red
cards, Campbell is pitched headlong into the Hampden Park bearpit
for a game that promises yet more blood and thunder football.
</P>
<P>
But as the tackles fly in thick and fast and others around him
lose their heads and their discipline, the Tottenham skipper
intends to be the coolest man on the pitch in the Euro 2000 play-
off first leg.
</P>
<P>
"A derby is quite frantic and anything goes. But you don't want
to lose it too much, you want to keep a cool head, you want to put
in a good performance as well," said 25-year-old Campbell.
</P>
<P>
"I can imagine Saturday is going to be a bit of a derby. Most
guys have been involved in those kind of domestic derbies so I can
imagine it might be the same.
</P>
<P>
"I don't really think about someone trying to wind me up, you
shouldn't really think of those kinds of things. You're a
professional footballer and want to play football.
</P>
<P>
"It's like if a crowd is winding you up. Everyone has a
breaking point but if you do you just bite your lip and get on
with it.
</P>
<P>
"There are a lot of things happening in the world and you look
at those situations and start thinking to yourself it's not all
happening to me, there are a lot more worse things happening in
the world.
</P>
<P>
"You put everything in perspective and say this is what I want
to do; I want to play football, that's the main thing," he said.
</P>
<P>
Campbell's calm, measured approach will extend to his behavior
before kick-off as well, with none of the fist waving and
posturing favored by some players to psyche themselves up for the
biggest game of their lives.

<HEADLINE> Cuba Condemns U.S. Intention to End Summits </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HAVANA, November 12 (Xinhua) -- Cuban Foreign Ministry
spokesman Alejandro Gonzalez said Friday that the U.S. attacks
against the upcoming 9th Ibero American Summit are part of a plan
to destroy that movement.
</P>
<P>
Gonzalez said that Washington has never seen with sympathy any
attempt to create an international organization in which it cannot
take part and decide, as it happens with the meetings of the Ibero
American chiefs of state and of government.
</P>
<P>
The attempts to boycott the Havana summit are not exclusively
against Cuba, but respond to a purpose the U.S. authorities expect
to achieve in the short or long term, said the spokesman.
</P>
<P>
Gonzalez said that to finance actions against the 9th
Iberoamercian Summit, a U.S. government agency has delivered this
year six million dollars to a Cuban counterrevolutionary
organization.
</P>
<P>
Those activities include the incident occurred last Wednesday
in a neighborhood of Havana when students sympathizing with the
Cuban revolution prevented a group of people from holding a
demonstration against the government during the development of a
cultural event.
</P>
<P>
Gonzalez said that the authorities will not permit any activity
of groups in the pay of the United States, adding that these
illegal actions have been reinforced in the last days.
</P>
<P>
He said that the U.S. right wing and the counterrevolution
leaders in Miami feel frustrated by the forecasts of the success
of the 9th Ibero American Summit and the almost unanimous
rejection of the United Nations to the U.S. embargo.
</P>
<P>
Heads of state of Spain, Portugal and most Latin American
countries will gather in Havana for the annual Ibero American
Summit.

<HEADLINE> Cuba Willing to Cooperate With U.S. in Anti Drug War </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HAVANA, November 12 (Xinhua) -- The Cuban government is willing
to cooperate with the United States in the combat against drug
traffic, a spokesman from the Foreign Ministry said on Friday.
</P>
<P>
Alehandro Gonzalez said at the Press Center of the 9th
Iberoamerican Summit that Cuba is willing to offer Washington
"free of charge" cooperation in the war against drugs.
</P>
<P>
Gonzalez called positive U.S. President Bill Clinton's decision
to abstain from including Cuba in the list of countries used as
transit for the drugs introduced into the United States.
</P>
<P>
Clinton made this decision Thursday, despite recommendations
made by a group of Republican House representatives.
</P>
<P>
The spokesman said that "the United States has recognized the
efforts of out country to thwart the efforts of the drug
traffickers to use Cuban territorial waters."
</P>
<P>
He said that Cuba has offered to maintain a broad cooperation
on the issue.
</P>
<P>
The White House issues every year a list of countries
considered as a catapult for the introduction of drugs to the U.S.
market, and that the practice of threatening with sanctions the
countries listed has been widely criticized.

<HEADLINE> Russia Should Directly Focus on Terrorism in Chechny: </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, November 12 (Xinhua) -- U.N. Secretary-General
Kofi Annan, in a statement issued by his spokesman here, Friday
said that the use of force should "be proportional and directly
focused on the terrorists themselves."
</P>
<P>
"While committed to combating and ending terrorism, he
considers it vital that the use of force to combat this scourge
should be proportional, and should be focused directly on the
terrorists themselves."
</P>
<P>
In his sharpest criticism yet of Russia's drive against
separatists in Chechnya, Annan said Friday Moscow seemed to have
gone "far beyond" its aim of rooting out terrorists.
</P>
<P>
The U.N. chief expressed concern at the suffering of innocent
civilians and pointedly stressed that the Geneva Conventions must
be respected at all times.
</P>
<P>
Moscow says it is battling "terrorists" in Chechnya and has
blamed them for a number of bomb explosions in Russian cities
that have killed some 300 people.
</P>
<P>
But nearly seven weeks of fighting between Russian forces and
Chechen rebels have created a refugee crisis in the North
Caucasus. Some 200,000 Chechen refugees have fled, mostly to
neighboring Ingushetia, and there are reports of civilian deaths.
</P>
<P>
Annan, currently on an Asia tour, noted that humanitarian law,
including especially the Geneva Conventions, "is binding and must
be fully respected at all times."
</P>
<P>
"This means that the protection of innocent civilians from the
effects of conflict should always receive the highest priority,"
he said.
</P>
<P>
"The secretary-general therefore is disturbed to see that the
scope of the military offensive in Chechnya seems to have evolved
far beyond a campaign with the limited objective of rooting out
terrorists, and that it has caused great suffering and high
casualties to civilians, including the elderly and women and
children."
</P>
<P>
The U.N. chief made a new appeal to the Russian leadership "to
take immediate steps to protect the civilian population from
further suffering."
</P>
<P>
He also urged them to lose no time in seeking a long-term
solution to the conflict, which could "only be done through a
political process."
</P>
<P>
"This will be essential in ensuring prompt international action
to alleviate the suffering of the innocent civilian victims of the
conflict," Annan said.

<HEADLINE> Panama Criticizes U.S. Certification </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PANAMA CITY, November 12 (Xinhua) -- The United States approval
of the anti-drug efforts of Panama and of other Latin American
countries by means of the so-called "certification" is a
unilateral imposition, said Friday Panamanian antidrug prosecutor
Rosendo Miranda.
</P>
<P>
"The certification issued by the U.S. authorities does not
affect at all the measures of repression against drug traffic
adopted by Panama," said Miranda during the "Drug Traffic,
Globalization, and Organized Crime Forum at the Start of a New
Millennium," held Friday in this capital.
</P>
<P>
Panama was included by the U.S. government in a list of 26
countries who permit the traffic of drugs in their territory,
which caused deep displeasure to Panamanian authorities.
</P>
<P>
According to Miranda, the certification created by Washington
is obsolete and will be substituted by a method of multilateral
evaluation, which means that several countries will exchange
evaluations and will establish measures of mutual cooperation.
</P>
<P>
Miranda said that the Panamanian Antidrug effort has had
positive results in the last years, which are seen in the capture
of drug traffickers and the seizure of big amounts of drugs.
</P>
<P>
The Drug Prosecutorship Office authorities have captured three
tons of drugs this year, including marihuana and cocaine.
</P>
<P>
The drug prosecutor said that drug traffickers have moved their
operations from Panama to other Central American countries with
less antidrug controls, because of the blows given by Panamanian
authorities to drug traffic.

The Council underlined the necessity of the full resumption of
the work of the Commission on National Reconciliation(CNR), and
reiterated its encouragement to CNR to intensity its efforts to
broaden a dialogue among the various political forces in the
country in the interests of the restoration and strengthening of
civil accord in Tajikistan.

UNITED NATIONS, November 12 (Xinhua) -- The United Nations
Security Council on Friday urged the parties concerned in Georgia
to deepen their commitment to the U.N.-led peace process.
</P>
<P>
The move came after the Council reviewed the latest
developments in the country.
</P>

In a presidential statement, the Council noted with grave
concern that no progress has been made on the key issues of the
settlement, particularly the core issue for the status of
Abkhazia, Georgia.
</P>
<P>
The Council called upon the parties to agree upon and to take,
in the nearest future, the first concrete steps towards the full
return to Abkhazia, Georgia, of refugees and internally displaced
persons in safe, secure and dignified conditions.
</P>
<P>
The Council reminded the parties that this would enable the
Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees to

contravention of the principles of the sovereignty and territorial
integrity of Georgia.
</P>
