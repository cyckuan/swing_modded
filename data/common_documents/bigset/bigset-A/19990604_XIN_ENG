<HEADLINE> Egypt Reopens Giza Pyramid After Restoration </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, June 3 (Xinhua) -- Egypt reopened to tourists the
Pyramid of Cheops, the biggest of the famous Giza trio, on
Thursday following more than a year of repair work.
</P>
<P>
Along with the pyramid, Egypt also opened the Sphinx temple and
three tombs near the 4,500-year-old structure.
</P>
<P>
The restoration of the Pyramid of Cheops, built as a tomb for
King Cheops, included mending cracks, cleaning up graffiti and
installing new lighting and ventilation systems.
</P>
<P>
The repair work by French and Egyptian restorers, which Egypt's
chief archeologist Gaballah Ali Gaballah termed as "compatible
with the loftiness of the great monument," cost 100,000 Egyptian
pounds (29,500 U.S. dollars). Donations kept the price down.
</P>
<P>
A French company gave a ventilation system to relieve the
ancient structure of built-up humidity, the result of the
breathing of thousands of visitors who visit the pyramid everyday.
</P>
<P>
To protect the structure from now on, only 300 visitors will be
allowed inside the pyramid each day, down from the daily droves of
5,000 before the restoration.
</P>
<P>
The nearby Sphinx temple was repaired in 12 months following a
10-year face-lift for the nearly 4,500-year-old half-lion,
half-man figure.
</P>
<P>
The 20-meter by 20-meter temple, which stands in front of the
Sphinx, has 24 pillars representing the day's hours. It also has
two carved niches that depict sunrise and sunset.
</P>
<P>
Two of the three newly discovered tombs belong to Nefer Maet,
King Chefren's son and his prime minister, and to Sneferu-kha-ef,
the king's treasurer. The third tomb belongs to Shesem-Nefer,
whose title was secret keeper to a king whose name historians were
not able to identify.

<HEADLINE> Chernomyrdin May Have More Talks With EU, U.S. Envoys </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, June 3 (Xinhua) -- Russian special envoy for the
Balkans Viktor Chernomyrdin said here Thursday that he may go to
Helsinki Friday to have more talks with Finnish President Martti
Ahtisaari and U.S. Deputy Secretary of State Strobe Talbott.
</P>
<P>
Speaking to reporters just after returning from Belgrade,
Chernomyrdin rejected charges by Russian lawmakers that the
Russian delegations did not take the interests of Russia and
Yugoslavia into full account during the settlement talks.
</P>
<P>
"I have long said that there (in the State Duma) is a
contingent that should be checked," Chernomyrdin said without
elaboration..
</P>
<P>
He also denied reports of internal disagreements among the
Russian delegation members during the talks in Bonn and Belg.Kde.
</P>
<P>
The Defense Ministry's International Military Cooperation
Department chief, Col. Gen. Leonid Ivashov, who returned along
with Chernomyrdin, said that during the course of consultations
and talks the military contingent of the delegation explained to
Chernomyrdin its vision of the role to be played by NATO and
Russia in a settlement of the Kosovo problem.
</P>
<P>
"In our hearts, we soldiers are dissatisfied with many
conditional points agreed upon in the negotiations. Much is
unclear and depends on the conscientiousness of our negotiating
partners, and above all on NATO. A suspension of the bombing can
take place quickly, but that will depend on NATO good will,"
Interfax quoted Ivashov as saying.
</P>
<P>
He cited plans according to which NATO will deploy its troops
in Kosovo after the Serbian units, border troops included, leave
the region.
</P>
<P>
"If the Serbian border guards are taken out deep inside the
country and NATO units engage in mere monitoring rather than
closing the border, this may lead to serious consequences,"
Ivashov warned.
</P>
<P>
Chernomyrdin, for his part, said Moscow "will rely on the
conscientiousness on the part of our negotiating partners from
NATO."

<HEADLINE> Nigerian Parliament Elects New Leaders </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ABUJA, June 3 (Xinhua) -- Nigeria's New National Assembly
Thursday voted for Even Enwerem and Buhari Ibrahim as the
country's top legislature heads.
</P>
<P>
In a prolonged opening session of the parliament, Even Enwerem,
former Governor of Imo State in southeastern Nigeria was elected
by the 109-member senate as their president, the third
highest-ranking constitutional position after president and
vice-resident.
</P>
<P>
Enwerem, until recently a national political dark horse,
surprised pundits by beating second term Senator Chuba Okadigbo
who was highly favored for the election.
</P>
<P>
The victory caps a roller coaster political journey which began
with a disappointing failure in the gubernatorial primaries for
the governorship of Abia early this year.
</P>
<P>
After that failure, Enwerem joined the ruling People's
Democratic Party and got elected to the senate.
</P>
<P>
In the 360-member House of Representatives, Buhari Ibrahim was
unanimously elected as the speaker, the fourth highest-ranking
constitutional position.
</P>
<P>
The election of the two officers, both from the ruling party,
were not as competitive as expected because of the party's "zoning
policy", under which various positions were zoned along the six
geo-political lines, said a local analyst.
</P>
<P>
Along with their leaders, senators and representatives have
been sworn in by turns in the National Assembly Building located
in the north of the hill-surrounded Nigeria capital Abuja.
</P>
<P>
Members of the assembly got elected to Nigeria's top
legislature in a nationwide election held February this year.
</P>
<P>
The February election was part of the hand-over process which
culminated in President Olusegun Obasanjo's inauguration on May
29.
</P>
<P>
President Obasanjo is expected to address the National Assembly
Friday, according to an official press release issued Wednesday.

<HEADLINE> U.S. State Department Says to Be Cautious for Balgrade's </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, June 3 (Xinhua) -- Following the White House and
the Pentagon, the U.S. State Department on thursday made a similar
cautious reaction to Yuguslavia's acceptance of a peace plan for
Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
State Department spokesman James Rubin told a regular briefing
that if reports about the Yugoslav parliament's approval of the
peace plan was "accurate", "that will be a major step forward."
</P>
<P>
But he said it was not clear yet what Yugoslav President
Slobodan Milosevic had accepted and what the Yugoslav parliament
had accepted.
</P>
<P>
"This is a very cautious time," he said.
</P>
<P>
"So our watchword of the day is 'caution, codification and
implementation'," Rubin added.
</P>
<P>
He said U.S. Deputy Secretary of State Strobe Talbott was
meeting with Finnish President Martti Ahtisaari in Bonn, Germany.
Ahtisaari was providing to him a full readout of the discussions
that he and Russian special Victor Chernomyrdin had held with
Milosevic.
</P>
<P>
Rubin said what the United States was going to be doing in the
coming days "is confirming the details of what precisely has been
agreed to" by Belgrade.

<TEXT>
<P>
ADDIS ABABA, June 3 (Xinhua) -- The Ethiopian National
Meteorological Services Agency Thursday urged farmers to begin
cultivation, taking advantage of the prevailing favorable weather
condition.
</P>
<P>
The meteorological agency predicted that most parts of the
country are expected to receive heavy rains this production season
from June to September, the Ethiopian News Agency reported.
</P>
<P>
The main rainy season crops produce almost 90 percent of the
harvest of the Horn of Africa country every year.
</P>
<P>
This year's small rainy season from February to May failed to
bring the rain in most parts of Ethiopia. This week the nation
appealed for 360,000 tons of food aid for an estimated 4.6 million
people facing shortages caused by the rain failure.

<HEADLINE> Egypt Detains 29 Militant Suspects </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, June 3 (Xinhua) -- Egyptian state security prosecutors
detained 29 men Thursday on grounds that they were reviving the
ideology of an influential Egyptian ideologue who called for using
violence to install an Islamic rule.
</P>
<P>
The police arrested the men on Wednesday in Gharbia
Governorate, 80 kilometers north of Cairo, Egypt's Middle East
News Agency quoted security sources as saying. The sources added
that the arrestees will remain in detention for 15 days pending
investigations.
</P>
<P>
The men are suspected of forming an illegitimate group whose
aim is to violate the constitution, and of spreading extremist
ideas, they said.
</P>
<P>
The group is led by Salah Ahmed el-Shazly, who the officials
said taught his followers to embrace the ideology of Sayed Qutb,
who branded Muslim governments as un-Islamic, repressive and
subservient to the West.
</P>
<P>
Qutb called for arms to fight the governments and replace them
with Islamic states. Many in the Muslim world consider him a
martyr since his 1966 execution on charges of plotting a coup.
</P>
<P>
El-Shazly recruited his followers from the villages of Kafr
el-Hawashem and Kafr Samah in Gharbia, the officials said.
</P>
<P>
Since 1992, Egypt has fought a campaign of violence launched by
Muslim militants bent on replacing the government with a strict
Islamic regime.
</P>
<P>
The government has largely quelled the violence and has
imprisoned thousands of the militants.

<HEADLINE> First Step Toward Peace: Finnish President </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
COLOGNE, June 3 (Xinhua) -- European Union envoy, Finnish
President Martti Ahtisaari said on Thursday that the first step
toward peace in the Balkans had been made.
</P>
<P>
Upon returning from a trip to Belgrade, the Finnish president
told the press that the Yugoslav government and Yugoslav President
Slobodan Milosevic had accepted the peace plan he brought to them
together with Russian envoy Viktor Chernomyrdin.
</P>
<P>
"It is a very good day for Europe," said Federal Chancellor
Gerhard Schroeder whose country is serving the rotating presidency
of the 15-nation union.
</P>
<P>
The German chancellor added that it was good for the people of
Europe and the people of Yugoslavia as well.
</P>
<P>
The Finnish president said that if agreed, the peace plan would
be the first step leading up to withdrawal of Yugoslav army and
police units from Kosovo and the withdrawal would in turn lead to
suspension of NATO bombing of the Balkan country.
</P>
<P>
Ahtisaari, an old hand in peace-making and peace-keeping in the
Balkans, said that during his trip to Belgrade, he drove home the
message that the peace plan he and Chernomyrdin brought with was
the best offer to Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
The German chancellor thanked the Finnish president for his
patience and skill in dealing with the Serbian leadership for the
acceptance.
</P>
<P>
The Finnish president, however, warned that people had to be
careful with what had been achieved already. "The proof of
pudding is eating it," said Ahtisaari who cited his drawn-out
peace-making experience in Nambia between 1978 and 1989.
</P>
<P>
"There are still lots of hard work to be done and there are
still lots of issues that remain to be solved," said the Finnish
president who went through, since May 1 this year, four close
discussions with Chernomyrdin and United States Deputy Secretary
of State Strobe Talbott before presenting the peace plan of the
Group of Eight to the Yugoslav authorities.
</P>
<P>
One of the key issues, according to the Finnish president,
would be the working out of a timetable for the withdrawal itself.
</P>
<P>
When asked whether the withdrawal of Yugoslav troops from
Kosovo would be total, Ahtisaari said that both sides understood
that the withdrawal had to be 100 percent but certain agreed
numbers of troops would be allowed to return.
</P>
<P>
He said that the NATO and the Yugoslav military would start
negotiating the timetable of the withdrawal which he said could be
completed within days and not weeks.
</P>
<P>
"In days and very few days," said Ahtisaari, "the timetable
would take days to work out." He added that he was personally
prepared to travel to Belgrade again as further diplomatic
efforts.
</P>
<P>
As regards the peace-keeping formula, the Finnish president
cited his talks with United Nations Secretary General Koffi Annan
and said that the formula of peace-keeping in Bosnia and
Herzegovina would be suitable.
</P>
<P>
Ahtisaari described his talks with Yugoslav President Milosevic
and other Serbian leaders late on Wednesday and early on Thursday
as "very business-like" and they had to raise their voices
sometimes in discussions.
</P>
<P>
He returned to Cologne to brief the European Union Summit a bit
late due to re-fueling of his plane in Budapest.

<TEXT>
<P>
ATHENS, June 3 (Xinhua) -- Greece reiterated Thursday that it
hopes the Kosovo crisis could be settled through political means.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a press briefing, Greek government spokesman Yannis
Nikolaou said that the resolution of the Kosovo situation would
not be one-day procedure and Greece must play a role of stability
and peace-making in the Balkan region.
</P>
<P>
In a related development, Greek Foreign Minister George
Papandreou said in Cologne, Germany, Thursday that the withdrawal
of Serb forces from Kosovo must be accompanied by an end to NATO's
bombing campaign against Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
Since the start of Kosovo crisis, Greece, a member of NATO and
the European Union (EU), has repeatedly said that it favors a
peaceful solution to the crisis instead of a NATO military
intervention.
</P>
<P>
To help bring an early end to the crisis, Greece has asked NATO
to halt the passage of the alliance troops and military supplies
through the northern Greek port of Thessaloniki for neighboring
Macedonia.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Lawmakers Say Kosovo War Illegal </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, June 3 (Xinhua) -- Oral arguments started here
Thursday before U.S. District Court Judge Paul Friedman on a
lawsuit challenging the legality of U.S. bombing in Yugoslavia and
President Clinton's motion to dismiss the lawsuit.
</P>
<P>
U.S. Attorneys associated with the New York-based Center for
Constitutional Rights (CCR) asked Judge Paul Friedman to permit
the lawsuit brought on behalf of a bi-partisan group of U.S.
representatives charging that American air war against Yugoslavia
is illegal to proceed.
</P>
<P>
The Congressional plaintiffs, led by California Republican
representative Tom Campbell, are seeking a declaration from the
U.S. District Court that President Clinton is violating the
Constitution by launching war against Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
The plaintiffs said only the Congress has the authority to
declare war and the Constitution sets statutory limits on the
President's ability to conduct war unilaterally.
</P>
<P>
According to CCR co-operating attorney, Jules Lobel, the recent
vote 213-213 vote in the Congress refusing to authorize the
bombing underscores the lawsuit's claims that "unlike every major
engagement since Korea, the President has not even a semblance of
authority to bomb Yugoslavia".
</P>
<P>
"The President is violating a fundamental principle of the
America system: one man alone cannot decide to go to war," CCR
attorney Michael Ratner said.
</P>
<P>
Michael Ratner said the District Court will make a judgement on
this case Monday or Tuesday, but if the U.S. government "gets
relieved", they will go to the Court of Appeal and then the
Supreme Court.
</P>
<P>
At a press conference immediately after the oral argument
Thursday, Representative Roscoe Bartlett, who is also a plaintiff,
said there is enough evidence that President Clinton has violated
the law. "We hope he will comply with the law," he said.
</P>
<P>
On April 28, 1999, the U.S. Congress voted overwhelmingly
against declaring war against Yugoslavia and defeated a concurrent
resolution to continue the air war, but President Clinton
dismissed the Congress proposal and continued the war against
Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
Later 26 Members of Congress led by Tom Campbell filed a
lawsuit to compel President Clinton to follow the constitution and
halt U.S. armed forces from engaging in military action in
Yugoslavia unless the Congress declares war or grants the
president specific statutory authority to declare war.
</P>
<P>
However, on May 22, attorneys for President Clinton filed a
Motion to dismiss the suit brought by the bipartisan group of the
Congress members.

<HEADLINE> Chirac Welcomes Yugoslav Acceptance of Peace Plan </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, June 3 (Xinhua) -- French President Jacques Chirac
Thursday welcomed the acceptance by Yugoslavia of the peace plan
presented jointly by Russia, the European Union and the United
States for ending the conflict over Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
In a speech addressed to the French people, Chirac said that
``a real hope for peace has been born'' although much work remains
to be done to realize peace.
</P>
<P>
He stressed that the engagement made by Belgrade must be proved
by facts, including a precise timetable for the withdrawal of Serb
forces from Kosovo, which he said should be followed by a stop of
NATO bombings.
</P>
<P>
He said that all parties involved should work with emergency to
implement the peace plan.
</P>
<P>
The peace plan includes the stop of military operation by Serb
forces in Kosovo, the withdrawal of the Serb forces from the
province, the return of Kosovar refugees to their homes, and the
deployment of a NATO-led U.N. peace keeping force there.
</P>
<P>
The Serbian Parliament voted on Thursday to accept the peace
plan and Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic also said he
accepted the plan when he met with Finnish President Martti
Ahtisaari and Russian envoy Viktor Chernomyrdin.
</P>
<P>
Chirac said that the United Nations Security Council should
adopt without delay a resolution authorizing the creation of the
Kosovo Peace Force (KFOR) and the establishment of ``an interim
civil administration'' in Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
The French president thanked the French nation to support the
government's engagement in the NATO air campaign, saying that
France was in a semi-state of war over the past 72 days.
</P>
<P>
France sent more than 100 warplanes and thousands of troops in
the NATO campaign over Yugoslavia, the second biggest contributor
to the ``Allied Force'' operation after the United States.
</P>
<P>
France also plans to contribute 6,000 soldiers to the future
KFOR.

on Thursday in Bucharest that, as a result of the Yugoslav
Parliament's positive vote on the international peace plan,
"things are going in the right way."
</P>
<P>
After Meeting Eduard Kukan, Romania's Foreign Minister Andrei

the Southeastern European Cooperation would be one of the best
instruments to implement this project.

<HEADLINE> Cyprus Not to Accept Turkish Version on Persons </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NICOSIA, June 3 (Xinhua) -- Cyprus' Foreign Minister Ioannis
Kasoulides stressed here Thursday that Cyprus will never accept
the Turkish assertion that all Cypriots and Greeks missing in wars
since 1974 are dead.
</P>
<P>
Cyprus has been divided into the Turkish Cypriots-controlled
north and the Greek Cypriots-dominated south since 1974 when
Turkish troops invaded and occupied the northern third of the
island in the wake of a failed coup seeking union with Athens.
</P>
<P>
There are 1,619 persons from the Cypriot side listed as missing
in wars since 1974 and so far only one of them has been
established as dead.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a press conference, Kasoulides said the purpose of
the process of exhumation, now underway, is "primarily to deal
with a very grave humanitarian issue."
</P>
<P>
Cyprus started early this week to exhume and examine remains
of the Greek-Cypriot and Greek victims in the 1974 war to find out
their identities.
</P>
<P>
Kasoulides expressed the hope that this process would convey
the message to the international community and the Turkish side
that such a process can be carried out in accordance with the
provisions of the July 31 Agreement of 1997.
</P>
<P>
The said agreement calls on the Greek and Turkish Cypriot sides

He also said the Cyprus government "is ready to proceed with
exhumations of Turkish Cypriots as part of the implementation of
the July 1997 agreement on the basis of reciprocity."

<P>
TEHRAN, June 3 (Xinhua) -- Iranian President Mohammad Khatami
said on Thursday that Tehran-Addis Ababa cooperation can leave
positive effects on establishing peace in a large area in the
world.
</P>
<P>
In his meeting with visiting Ethiopian Foreign Minister Seyoum
Mesfin, Khatami said that both Iran and Ethiopia are located in
the sensitive regions of Persian Gulf and the Horn of Africa, the
two regions in need of peace and tranquility.
</P>
<P>
Unfortunately, certain powers do not want to see peace in these
regions, he said, adding that "we should act with prudence and
wisdom in our own regions, we should work to forge understanding
between the regional states."
</P>
<P>
Iran is ready to put its experiences in construction at the
disposal of Ethiopia, the Islamic Republic News Agency quoted
Khatami as saying.
</P>
<P>
Referring to the conflict between Ethiopia and Eritrea,
Khatami expressed hope that the two countries would settle their
disputes through peaceful means.
</P>
<P>
During the meeting, Mesfin handed over a written message from
Ethiopian President Negasso Gidada to Khatami and said that there
are numerous grounds for cooperation between the two countries.
</P>
<P>
The two countries can establish friendly relations on the
basis of mutual interests, said the Ethiopian official, who
arrived here on Wednesday for a two-day visit.

<HEADLINE> News Analysis: Annan Works Hard to Beef up U.N. Role </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, June 3 (Xinhua) -- U.N. Secretary-General Kofi
Annan on Wednesday evening flew to Rome for a Thursday meeting
with Pope John Paul II to discuss the Kosovo crisis, followed by
his talks with Italian leaders.
</P>
<P>
This was the U.N. chief's second European tour since mid-May to
to restore peace in the Balkans, a series of steps by Annan to
strengthen U.N. role in the Kosovo peace process.
</P>
<P>
Annan has sent a humanitarian assessment mission to Kosovo, and
the 15-member team just returned from its 11-day fact-finding
mission with an initial report to the Security Council, which
attacked NATO for a serious humanitarian crisis in the Balkan
country.
</P>
<P>
The U.N. mission was precedented by the diplomacy of two U.N.
special envoys for Kosovo, named by Annan to give him a hand in
search for a peace plan.
</P>
<P>
The 185-member United Nations, which has the primary
responsibility for maintaining peace and security in the world at
large, has been long sidelined by the U.S.-led NATO on the issue
of Kosovo, particularly on the NATO bombing of Yugoslavia since
March 24.
</P>
<P>
Many countries here say that the United Nations simply remains
a bystander on the crucial issue concerning war and peace over the
past few months.
</P>
<P>
Annan took the move for an active involvement on Kosovo amid
world appeals for a stronger role in ending NATO bombing and
bringing peace back to the Balkan region, long considered "a
powder keg" in Europe.
</P>
<P>
"The Security Council should play an important role in the
process of a political solution, and we appreciate the efforts by
the Secretary-General in this regard," Shen Guofang, deputy
Chinese permanent representative to the United Nations, told a
closed-door Security Council session Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
"It would be of great sadness for all its Member States if the
United Nations remains an onlooker on the important issue of war
and peace at a time when NATO air strikes" went on unabated, he
said.
</P>
<P>
However, what the world body is determined to do at present is
only limited to humanitarian affairs and post-war reconstructions
in Kosovo when the United Nations is supposed to work harder also
to promote a ceasefire and seek a political solution.
</P>
<P>
"We reject any effort to marginalize the United Nations, nor do
we accept that the United Nations is only limited to its role in
addressing humanitarian problems and the post-war reconstruction,"
Shen added.
</P>
<P>
Belgrade Thursday announced its acceptance of the peace plan
hammered out by G-8, Russia plus seven major Western countries,
the United Nations, whose role is recognized by both Yugoslavia
and G-8 the wordings of the document brought to Yugoslav President
Slobodan Milosevic by Viktor Chernomyrdin, the Russian special
envoy for the Balkans.
</P>
<P>
It is widely accepted that the only way out is to resume the
U.N. role in the Kosovo peace process. But, the problem is how,
when the world body is being marginalized?
</P>
<P>
The two special envoys, some three weeks after their
appointment, are still not clear about their mandate while
Washington insists on the secondary role for the U.N. special
envoys.
</P>
<P>
Some would say that the world needs the United Nations and the
United Nations also needs the world. Yugoslavia needs the United
Nations to break away from its month-long bystander status on
Kosovo, and play a central role in mediating peace in Kosovo while
safeguarding its sovereignty and territorial integrity, where the
most serious humanitarian crisis was created as a result of NATO
bombing since the end of World War II.

the U.S.-NATO aggression on an independent state does not bear
any legitimacy, adding each independent state has become
threatened in a deal or another by the American arrogance.

<HEADLINE> Drought Affects Middle East: U.N. Report </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, June 3 (Xinhua) -- Several Middle East
countries have been hit by drought with Jordan experiencing "worst
drought in decades" where food production goes sharply down, U.N.
agencies said on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Jordan's Cereal and other food crops have been decimated and
sheep farmers are facing financial ruin, the U.N. Food and
Agriculture Organization (FAO) and World Food Program (WFP) said
in a joint report released here.
</P>
<P>
The report forecasts a domestic cereal harvest of just 13,000
tons in the kingdom, able to cover less than one percent of its
domestic needs, instead of usual 10 percent.
</P>
<P>
Because of the serious economic difficulties facing Jordan,
only 80% of its cereal import requirements is expected to be met
commercially, leaving a deficit of 387,000 tons which need to be
covered by emergency food aid, the report said.
</P>
<P>
The U.N. agencies listed Syria, Iraq and Iran as other
countries affected by drought.

<P>
CAIRO, June 3 (Xinhua) -- Fourteen people were burned to death
on Thursday when two trucks collided and exploded on a speedway
outside Cairo.
</P>
<P>
The trucks, traveling in opposite directions on the
Katamiya-Sokhna highway, were speeding, Egypt's Middle East News
Agency (MENA) reported.
</P>
<P>
MENA said that all the people on the two trucks were killed,
including the drivers and workers who were traveling to or from
Cairo on their way home.
</P>
<P>
It is common in Egypt for workers to be transported in trucks,
which often use the speedways skirting Cairo to avoid the heavy
traffic of the city.
</P>
<P>
Traffic accidents are common in Egypt as vehicles are often
driven at high speed and drivers are typically impatient.

<HEADLINE> Mozambican Govt Vows to guarantee Smooth Elections </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MAPUTO, June 3 (Xinhua) -- The Mozambican government will try
hard to guarantee smooth the second elections, Edgar Cossa,
spokesman for the ruling Mozambican Liberation Front (Frelimo)
said.
</P>
<P>
Cossa said that the government is sure that the elections can
be held this year, while denying the belief that the elections
will be postponed to avoid the coming rainy season, the Noticias
newspaper reported Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The climate factor can not be taken as a reason for delay of
the elections, he said, adding that Frelimo will give adequate
consideration to problems like material supply which may end in
late elections.
</P>
<P>
But Afonso Dhlakma, leader of Mozambican National Resistance
Movement, the biggest opposition party, said that the
government-approved time of 60 days for voters registration is
"ridiculous", as eligible voters will not have enough time to
register for the elections in the farming country which lack
sufficient transport facilities.
</P>
<P>
Dhlakma said that he forwarded the proposal of a late election
to the parliament last October but was rejected.
</P>
<P>
But Jose Chicurra Massinga, secretary general for the
Democratic Union (UD), another influential party, said that
further study should be done to decide the final time for the
elections.
</P>
<P>
He said that if the current registration time of July 20 to
September 17 is fixed, the elections can only be held in
mid-November or December, when only voters in major cities, who
are mostly in favor of the ruling party, can cast their ballots,
while many voters in remote rural areas, who have not proper
transport for either the registration or ballot casting will fail
to turn out.

<HEADLINE> Writethru: Pakistan Hands Over Indian Pilot to ICRC </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, June 3 (Xinhua) -- Pakistan handed over the captured
Indian pilot, Flight Lieutenant K. Nachiketa, to the International
Committee of Red Cross (ICRC) here late Thursday night after
India's refusal to receive the pilot.
</P>
<P>
Indian High Commissioner to Pakistan G. Parthasarty was invited
to the Foreign Office to receive Nachiketa, Foreign Office
spokesman Tariq Altaf told reporters.
</P>
<P>
"The Indian High Commissioner, However, has refused to accept
the Indian Air Force pilot in the presence of ICRC and the media,"
Altaf said.
</P>
<P>
As a result, Pakistan handed over the Indian pilot to ICRC, he
added.
</P>
<P>
Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif announced at a press briefing
Thursday afternoon that as "a gesture of goodwill", Pakistan will
release the captured Indian pilot immediately and hand him over to
Indian High Commissioner G. Parthasarty.
</P>
<P>
The handover ceremony was scheduled at 19:00 p.m. (12:00GMT).
However, it was delayed for more than three hours because of the
Indian High Commissioner's refusal to accept the pilot.
</P>
<P>
The spokesman said, "We were trying to persuade the Indian High
Commissioner to come to receive the pilot, but they have refused
to receive the pilot in the presence of ICRC and the media."
</P>
<P>
"Our purpose in handing over the pilot in the presence of ICRC
representatives and the media is for the world to see that the
Indian pilot is safe and sound, and he has been accorded treatment
due to an officer," Altaf said.
</P>
<P>
He said that the procedure for handing over the officer in the
presence of ICRC and the media is in accordance with the
internationally accepted norms.
</P>
<P>
Pakistan is doing so also to "avoid a repetition of baseless
allegations", he added.
</P>
<P>
"The Indian High Commissioner's refusal to accept the officer
is regrettable," Altaf said.
</P>
<P>
Paul Bonald, head of the ICRC delegation in Pakistan, said on
the occasion that "the ICRC visited Thursday Flight Lieutenant
Nachiketa of Indian nationality in conformity with legal
procedures. We were in the position to interview without witness."
</P>
<P>
Bonald also said that an ICRC doctor completed a physical
examination of the Indian pilot, and he was found in "good
health". Details about the health condition were included in the
two handover certificates which are confidential and which will be
given to the Pakistani and Indian authorities.
</P>
<P>
The certificates will be signed by Pakistan and India, he said.
</P>
<P>
The Indian pilot was handed over to ICRC immediately after the
press briefing in the Foreign Office.
</P>
<P>
Nachiketa was captured alive on May 27 when his MiG-27 jet
fighter was shot down by Pakistani ground forces in the Pakistani
side of the Line of Control (LoC) in the disputed area of Kashmir.
</P>
<P>
Another Indian pilot named Ajay Ahuja, squadron leader of the
Indian Air Force, was killed and his dead body was returned to the
Indian side in Kargil sector on the LoC last Friday.

<HEADLINE> Fuel Price Increases Denounced In Zimbabwe </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The government announced Wednesday night a 27 percent and a 32
percent rise in the prices of petrol and diesel respectively.
</P>
<P>
CCZ Executive Director Elizabeth Nerwande said in a statement
Zimbabweans had their incomes already eroded and they could not
stand the increases anymore.
</P>
<P>
She said, "The CCZ urges the business community to act in good
faith and fulfill their social responsibility by not haphazardly
and instantly increasing prices of commodities as the existing
ones are already out of reach."
</P>
<P>
She said the council was lobbying for a legal mechanism to be
put in place to look into issues like productivity, costs of
production and pricing structures to address price increases.
</P>
<P>
"Since last year the prices of basic commodities have increased
by 300 percent," she said, adding, "This is an unfortunate
structure which would see the majority of Zimbabweans languishing
in poverty."
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Commercial Bank of Zimbabwe said Thursday inflation
is likely to peak at 65 percent within the next three months as a
result of inflationary pressures.
</P>
<P>
Among the pressures were the hike in the price of petrol by 27
percent and diesel by 32 percent with effect from June 3, which
were expected to result in the hikes of other prices, the bank
said.

HARARE, June 3 (Xinhua) -- Zimbabwe, Tanzania, Swaziland and
Mozambique have been chosen as pilot lands to raise awareness on
the value of rural people's knowledge in the sustainable use and
management of agricultural biodiversity for food security.
</P>
<P>
Regional Coordinator of the project Joseph Matowanyika told the
Zimbabwe News Agency Thursday that the project focus was on
building linkages between those who held the knowledge of use and
conservations on diversification in agriculture and policy makers.
</P>
<P>
"The projects' ambition is to leave behind stronger
institutions and structures in the region which will have a better
understanding of the capacity of local communities to preserve
agro-biodiversity for national and global food security," he said.
</P>
<P>
The project aims to increase the rural people's own sense of
recognition and value of their own indigenous farming systems as
well as increasing small grain varieties and species.
</P>
<P>
It will also strengthen the community's position as local food
providers and managers of agro-biodiversity.

<HEADLINE> Kenya, China Hold Business Talks </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, June 3 (Xinhua) -- More than 150 entrepreneurs and
businessmen from Kenya and China Thursday gathered at the Grand
Regency Hotel here to seek business opportunities and joint
ventures between the two countries.
</P>
<P>
 Sponsored by the Kenya National Chamber of Commerce and
Industry, the business talks started with a brief introduction of
China's machinery and electronics industry by Fan Shande, deputy
head of mechanical and electronic product import and export
department under the Chinese Ministry of Foreign Trade and
Economic Cooperation.
</P>
<P>
Fan said China has established a modern and comprehensive
mechanical and electronic sector, with the products exported to
over 180 countries and regions in the world.
</P>
<P>
Last year, China exported its mechanical and electronic
products to the United States, the EU and Japan worth of 3.9
billion U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
He noted that the mechanical and electronic products
manufactured by China are mostly suited to the needs of the
developing countries such as Kenya.
</P>
<P>
Chinese government has encouraged its enterprises to invest,
transfer their equipment and technology to the outside world and
build assembling plants overseas, Fan added.
</P>
<P>
Kassim Owango, Chairman of Kenya National Chamber of Commerce
and Industry, urged the Kenyan business community to seize this
opportunity for sincere discussions with Chinese counterparts in
economic cooperation such as introduction of Chinese technology
and equipment.
</P>
<P>
He expressed his hope that Chinese side would support the
development of Kenya's small enterprises which have registered a
rapid growth and played an important role in the country's
economy.
</P>
<P>
Owango disclosed that he would soon lead a large delegation
comprising small enterprises to visit China and tour a trade fair
in Qingdao, a coastal city in Shandong Province, east China.
</P>
<P>
At the talks, Kenyan participants from small businesses showed
their special interest in Chinese equipment and machinery for
cement production, textile and food processing, sugar refining,
irrigation and building materials.
</P>
<P>
Representatives from over 50 Kenyan small enterprises and some
10 Chinese companies attended Thursday's business talks.

ABUJA, June 3 (Xinhua) -- Nigeria's National Assembly was
inaugurated Thursday in Abuja, the west African country's
capital.
</P>
<P>
The Senate President Even Enwerem, Deputy President Haruna
Abubakar and House of Representative Speaker Buhari Ibrahim and
his deputy Chibudo Nwuch, who were elected at Thursday's prolonged
opening session of the assembly, were sworn in with other
parliament members.
</P>
<P>
The National Assembly, comprising a 109-member Senate and a
360-member House of Representatives, was re-established after a
nationwide election held in this February. The assembly was first
set up in 1992 and latter dismissed by the military regime on
November 18,1993.
</P>
<P>
Nigerian President Olusegun Obasanjo is expected to address the
new Assembly Friday.
</P>
<P>
Some members of the National Assembly had earlier voiced
dissatisfaction over the president's putting off of the
inauguration date originally decided Monday.
</P>
<P>
They accused the president of using the delay as a last-ditch
effort to push forward his own president candidates.
</P>
<P>
Hundreds of members-elect of the House of Representatives, the
lower chamber of the National Assembly, defied the government
order that they should return home, insisting that the assembly
must be inaugurated.

<HEADLINE> More Congolese Refugees Flee to W. Tanzania: Red </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, June 3 (Xinhua) -- The refugees fleeing conflict in
the east of the Democratic Republic of Congo are putting Red Cross
operation under pressure, the International Federation of Red
Cross and Red Crescent Societies said here Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The federation's Nairobi regional delegation noted in a news
release that a sharp rise in numbers of Congolese refugees
crossing Lake Tanganyika to western Tanzania has stretched the Red
Cross refugee camp at Lugufu, 90 kilometers east of the lake port
of Kigoma, beyond its planned capacity.
</P>
<P>
With 50,000 Congolese sheltered in Lugufu camp and more on the
way, the camp is already caring for 5,000 to 10,000 more than ever
anticipated, said the release.
</P>
<P>
"The world has more or less forgotten them, but more and more
refugees are coming here. There is an urgent need for funding,"
said Georg Nothelle, the Red Cross head of delegation in Tanzania.
</P>
<P>
The biggest problems might be water as the Lugufu camp lies in
a remote area and requires its own secure water supply, the news
release said, adding that to maintain a delivery of 12 liters per
person per day, the seven-kilometer pipeline may have to be
widened.
</P>
<P>
Since last August, almost 62,000 refugees have crossed Lake
Tanganyika, and in May alone there were 12,323 arrivals. From
January 21 to May 31 this year, over 37,000 were trucked by the
U.N. High Commission for Refugees (UNHCR) from Kigoma to the
Lugufu camp.
</P>
<P>
However, the Nairobi regional delegation noted that the Lugufu
camp has comprehensive medical facilities funded by the European
Union's Humanitarian Office, but the camp is on the alert for
cholera and measles which are present in the region.

<HEADLINE> Egypt Reopens Giza Pyramid After Restoration </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, June 3 (Xinhua) -- Egypt reopened to tourists the
Pyramid of Cheops, the biggest of the famous Giza trio, on
Thursday following more than a year of repair work.
</P>
<P>
Along with the pyramid, Egypt also opened the Sphinx temple and
three tombs near the 4,500-year-old structure.
</P>
<P>
The restoration of the Pyramid of Cheops, built as a tomb for
King Cheops, included mending cracks, cleaning up graffiti and
installing new lighting and ventilation systems.
</P>
<P>
The repair work by French and Egyptian restorers, which Egypt's
chief archeologist Gaballah Ali Gaballah termed as "compatible
with the loftiness of the great monument," cost 100,000 Egyptian
pounds (29,500 U.S. dollars). Donations kept the price down.
</P>
<P>
A French company gave a ventilation system to relieve the
ancient structure of built-up humidity, the result of the
breathing of thousands of visitors who visit the pyramid everyday.
</P>
<P>
To protect the structure from now on, only 300 visitors will be
allowed inside the pyramid each day, down from the daily droves of
5,000 before the restoration.
</P>
<P>
The nearby Sphinx temple was repaired in 12 months following a
10-year face-lift for the nearly 4,500-year-old half-lion,
half-man figure.
</P>
<P>
The 20-meter by 20-meter temple, which stands in front of the
Sphinx, has 24 pillars representing the day's hours. It also has
two carved niches that depict sunrise and sunset.
</P>
<P>
Two of the three newly discovered tombs belong to Nefer Maet,
King Chefren's son and his prime minister, and to Sneferu-kha-ef,
the king's treasurer. The third tomb belongs to Shesem-Nefer,
whose title was secret keeper to a king whose name historians were
not able to identify.

<HEADLINE> Captured Indian Pilot Reportedly Handed Over to India </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, June 3 (Xinhua) -- An Indian pilot captured by
Pakistan has been reportedly handed over to the Indian High
Commission in Islamabad Thursday evening.
</P>
<P>
The pilot, K. Nachiketa, was captured by the Pakistani army on
May 27 when his MiG-27 jet fighter was shot down in the Pakistani
side of the Line of Control (LoC) in the disputed area of Kashmir.
</P>
<P>
Scores of correspondents had been waiting since 7 o'clock p.m.
local time in the Foreign Office for the handover ceremony
announced by Pakistani Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif at a press
briefing Thursday afternoon.
</P>
<P>
But the Pakistan Television broadcast a piece of news at about
9 o'clock p.m., saying that the pilot had been handed over to the
Indian side.
</P>
<P>
Indian High Commissioner G. Parthasarty had been expected to be
present at the handover ceremony, but he refused later to appear
in front of the media, according to Pakistani officials.
</P>
<P>
Correspondents said the Indian diplomat probably regarded
Pakistan's arrangement as a humiliation to his country.
</P>
<P>
Pakistan's ground forces claimed to shoot down two Indian MiG
jet fighters last Thursday. The pilot of a MiG-21, Squadron Leader
Ajay Ahuja, was killed and his body was returned to the Indian
side in Kargil sector on the LoC last Friday.
</P>
<P>
During the press briefing Thursday afternoon, Pakistani Foreign
Minister Sartaj Aziz said he is looking forward to a proposed
visit to New Delhi to help defuse the tension in Kashmir.
</P>
<P>
"We hope the visit will take place as India has already
welcomed it," he said.
</P>
<P>
Pakistan has suggested to India the visit take place on June 7,
but is still waiting for response from the other side, said Aziz.

<HEADLINE> Ghana Not to Lower its Cocoa Price </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, June 3 (Xinhua) -- Ghana, the world second largest
cocoa producer, has decided to maintain the producer price of
cocoa for the 1999-2000 season despite the recent fall in the
price of the commodity on the world market.
</P>
<P>
 The decision follows recommendations of the Producer Price
Review Committee which said the current producer price should be
maintained at the level of 2.25 million cedis (about 1,000 U.S.
dollars, one dollar equals about 2,300 cedis) per ton in the 1999-
2000 season.
</P>
<P>
 The committee is made up of farmers, government
representatives and stakeholders in the cocoa industry, which is
the main foreign currency earner for the western African country
with an annual export of about 350, 000 tons.
</P>
<P>
 A load of 30 kilograms will be sold at 67,500 cedis while a
bag of 64 kilograms gross will fetch 140,625 cedis.
</P>
<P>
 Speaking to journalists at a press briefing in Accra, capital
of Ghana, Thursday, Finance Minister Kwame Peprah said the price
represents 74 percent of the projected Free On Board price.
</P>
<P>
 Present at the briefing were farmers, representatives of
buying companies and Ghana Cocoa Board, government officials and
companies that transport cocoa, Ghana News Agency reported.
</P>
<P>
 Cocoa prices on the world market hit their lowest in
six-and-a-half years last month going for 631 pounds per ton
although they were projected to reach 1,500 pounds.
</P>
<P>
 Peprah said this will mean a great loss in government revenue
of about 243 billion cedis for the next budget year while current
shortfall in this year's budget is estimated at 62 billion cedis.
</P>
<P>
 He explained that an immediate strategy has been adopted to
address short term losses by first reducing government
expenditure and increasing revenue base.
</P>
<P>
 Peprah indicated that a major source of revenue would be to
mobilize external financing.
</P>
<P>
He said the government has already initiated discussions with
donors for them to appreciate the implications and impact of
such negative trends on the world market and for them to support
initiatives aimed at reversing the trend.
</P>
<P>
 "We would also have to postpone some expenditures and raise
revenue base in the next financial year," he said.
</P>
<P>
Peprah said under the Cocoa Sector Development Strategy, the
government has accepted to pay 60 percent of the Free On Board
world price to farmers for the 1999/ 2000 season and to reach 70
percent by 2004/2005.
</P>
<P>
 In view of the importance attached to the development of
rural areas, the government has decided to accelerate the program
by paying 65 percent of the Free On Board beginning from the
light crop of 1999.
</P>
<P>
Based on the current 1999/2000 world cocoa projections, the 60
percent and the 65 percent would translate into 1.8 million
cedis per ton and 1.9 million cedis per ton respectively.
</P>
<P>
 These, the minister noted, are lower than the current price
of 2. 250 million cedis per ton by about 19 and 12 percent
respectively.
</P>
<P>
 The price of the produce has been falling since July 1998 as
a result of low demand for cocoa beans following the economic
crisis in Southeast Asia,  Eastern Europe and Latin America.
</P>
<P>
The crisis has affected other primary commodities to the
extent that all commodity price indices have declined to their
lowest in 30 years.
</P>
<P>
Peprah said large stocks of cocoa beans estimated at over one
million tons at the end of the 1998/1999 season and the expected
increase in production from Cote d'Ivoire, Ghana, Indonesia and
Malaysia during the 1999/ 2000 season due to favorable weather
have led to the price crash.
</P>
<P>
 The Finance Minister said maintaining the current price of
cocoa will be at the expense of government.
</P>
<P>
 It is not wise to let Ghanaian farmers face the full rigors
of the forces of the world market, he said, adding Ghana is at
the threshold of developing the industry to a new level and
needs to cushion the farmers to enable them to absorb the market
shocks.
</P>
<P>
Ghana is the world's second largest cocoa producer after Cote
d' Ivoire.

<HEADLINE> Russia Test Launches Intercontinental Missile </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, June 3 (Xinhua) -- The Russian Strategic Rocketry
service on Thursday successfully launched a silo-based Topol-M
ballistic missile.
</P>
<P>
In the seventh launch of the Topol-M in three years, the
missile lifted off from the Plesetsk test launch center in the
Arkhangelsk region at 18:20 Moscow time (14:20 GMT) and struck a
target nearly 9,000 kilometers away in Kamchatka, the Interfax
news agency reported, quoting the Strategic Rocketry press center.
</P>
<P>
The launch has demonstrated high reliability of the missile and
that this kind of missiles should become the basic strategic
missile for the country, said Col. Gen. Vladimir Yakovlev, the
Strategic Rocketry commander who supervised the launch.
</P>
<P>
A modernized Topol-M system was deployed in the Saratov region
last December.
</P>
<P>
The Topol-M can be launched either from silos or from mobile
platforms. Its availability for service is two times that of other
Russian strategic missiles, and it is 2-2.5 times more accurate,
Interfax reported.
</P>
<P>
The range of the three-stage, solid fuel burning Topol-M is
11,000 kilometers, its length is 22.7 meters with a maximum
diameter of 1.86 meters and launch weight of 47.2 tons.
</P>
<P>
Interfax said the Topol-M's electronics package enables it to
evade all existing and prospective anti-missile systems.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Factory Orders Fall 1.2 Percent in April </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, June 3 (Xinhua) -- Orders to U.S. factories for
manufactured goods dropped 1.2 percent because of a big decline in
demand for aircraft and other transportation products, the
Commerce Department reported Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The Department said that the drop in factory orders in April
followed a 1.9 percent rise in March and was only the second
decline in the past six months.
</P>
<P>
If excluding the volatile transportation sector, April's
factory orders would have risen by 0.5 percent, the Department's
report said.
</P>
<P>
The report showed that demand in transportation plummeted by
12.3 percent in April with the fall-off led by a 3.2 billion
dollars decline in orders for airplanes and parts. Orders for
ships and military tanks were off by 1.3 billion dollars.
</P>
<P>
The report also showed that orders for durable goods dropped
2.1 percent, slightly less than a preliminary report last week
that had put the decline at 2.3 percent.
</P>
<P>
Orders for non-durable goods fell a slight 0.1 percent in April
with declines in food and paper offsetting increases in textile
products. Non-durable goods orders had been up 0.7 percent in
March.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, orders for primary metals, including steel, showed
an increase of 1.6 percent. The steel industry has been one of the
hardest hit by the world financial crisis, suffering from a flood
of cheaper imported steel.

DAMASCUS, June 3 (Xinhua) -- Saudi Crown Prince Abdullah Bin

afternoon after concluding a two-day visit to Syria.
</P>
<P>
During his stay here, Abdullah, who is also Deputy Prime
Minister and Commander of the National Guard Corps, held three
rounds of talks with Syrian President Hafez Al-Assad on
outstanding regional issues.
</P>
<P>
The two leaders reviewed and coordinated the Arab stances on
various national issues as well as inter-Arab cooperation, said a

<P>
Saudi Arabia fully supports the Arab rights to all the occupied
territories especially to Jerusalem and the Golan Heights and
hopes a just and lasting peace will be realized in the region, the
source added.
</P>
<P>
The status of the holy city of Jerusalem has been a thorny issue
between the Arabs and the Israelis. The Arab world believes it
should be the future capital of an Palestinian state while Israel
considers it as its united and eternal capital. Syria is still
technically at war with Israel which has been occupying the Syrian
Golan Heights since 1967.
</P>

The Saudi prince also reasserted his country's support for the

<HEADLINE> Ethio-Eritrean War Endangers security in Somalia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOGADISHU, June 3 (Xinhua) -- The continuous Ethiopia-Eritrea
war has seriously endangered their neighboring country Somalia,
with Eritrea has reported supplied arms and brought some military
men in Somali port town of Merea, while Ethiopia has also rearmed
some Somalis.
</P>
<P>
The latest reports from Gedo Region, in southwestern Somalia,
indicate that the people in Bulo Hawo Town are fleeing their
hometown after the Ethiopian forces have started a major looting
operation against the well- off people in the town.
</P>
<P>
The Somali National Front spokesman (SNF), Ibrahim Jama
Howleh, has accused what he called the Ethiopian occupation
forces for ransacking the major food stores of the town.
</P>
<P>
Speaking to reporters here in Mogadishu Thursday, Howleh said
the Ethiopians have taken away four field radios and over 500
quintals of sugar and others food items from three food stores in
the town Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The SNF spokesman did not speak about killing or torturing of
civilians by the Ethiopians, but he has called the international
community to put pressure on the Ethiopian government to withdraw
its forces from Somalia.
</P>
<P>
The spokesman asked the UN, OAU, other regional and
international organizations to help stop what he called the
Ethiopian aggression and intervention in Somalia.
</P>
<P>
Independent sources from the town of Bulo Hawo, however,
confirmed that the Ethiopian forces stationed in the town have
launched a looting operation against three major food stores.
</P>
<P>
The sources who asked not to be mentioned, have confirmed that
200 sacks of sugar, five assault rifles and two VHF radios were
taken away by the Ethiopian forces from the town of Bulo Hawo.
</P>
<P>
The largest food store belonging to Abdullahi Yussuf Tindher
was the first that was attacked and its owner has escaped to the
neighboring town of Mandera across to Kenya his safety.
</P>
<P>
Reports reaching through VHF radios said dozens of families
especially the well-off families have fled Bulo Hawo town to
Garbaharrey, Bur Dhubo and the remote villages beyond the town of
Luq in the same Gedo Region.
</P>
<P>
The owners of those VHF radios said that they have fled the
town in fear of the Ethiopian daylight looting which began two
days ago.
</P>
<P>
 There is no apparent reason why the Ethiopians have begun the
looting, but sources close to the area said the Ethiopians have
suspected those businessmen of supporting General Omar Hmar Hajji
Masalleh, chairman of the SNF.
</P>
<P>
The Ethiopian forces had used to support General Masalleh
during their pursuing of the Al-Itihad fundamentalist group in
1996 and 1997, but General Masalleh and Ethiopia have fallen
apart after the General had signed the Cairo peace deal opposed
by Ethiopia together with the Somali factions in late 1997. And
since then, the Ethiopians have supported late Ali Nur, General
Masalleh's political rival who was killed in a bloody ambush at
the Somali-Kenyan border on April 8 this year.
</P>
<P>
The Ethiopian activities are not confined to Bulo Hawo and
Dolow towns both occupied by Ethiopia. But reports indicate that
Ethiopian forces, using seven battle wagons and over 200 infantry
men, have arrived in the town of Huddor.
</P>
<P>
Travelers who reached Mogadishu said the Ethiopians did not
hurt anyone, but said the Ethiopians had claimed to be heading
for Qoryoley Town, about 165 Km south of Mogadishu, where the
Oromo military were given their base when they came to Somalia on
a mysterious ship together with their arms.

Kim thanked the NPC and Chinese government on behalf of his
delegation and said that the people of his country have grieved
since the passing away of President Kim Il Sung five years ago and
that this was the main reason there had been no high-level
exchanges with China in recent years.

together and the bilateral friendship was cemented in their blood,
he said, and the leaders of the old generation, led by Chairman
Mao Zedong and President Kim Il Sung, laid a solid base for the
friendship.
</P>
<P>
In spite of the great changes in the world in recent years, the
bilateral friendship has continued to develop, he said, and
expressed his thanks on behalf of the DPRK Party and government to
the Chinese people for their contributions in overcoming the
DPRK's economic difficulties.
</P>
<P>
The DPRK Party and government were glad to see that China, led
by the Communist Party with Jiang Zemin at the core, has had great
success in building socialism with Chinese characteristics, he
said, and the DPRK Party and government fully support China's
reforms and opening up and respect the choice of the Chinese Party
and people.
</P>
<P>
He said he hopes the two will continue to enhance the
traditional friendship and cooperation.

<P>
Li Peng, the chairman of the Standing Committee of the National
People's Congress (NPC), held talks with Kim Yong Nam, the
president of the Presidium of the Supreme People's Assembly of the
Democratic People's Republic of Korea (DPRK).
</P>

and the Chinese Party and government place great importance on it.

Cox Report Refuted
</P>
<P>
Chinese military experts said today that accusations of China's
alleged "theft" of classified U.S. military information contained
in the Cox Report are not only ridiculous, but also an intentional
insult designed to show contempt for Chinese scientists.
</P>
<P>
In fact, the performance data of the warheads in question was
published in public periodicals in the United States in the 1970s
and 1980s. Therefore, the theft of such information was both
impossible and unnecessary, they said.

<HEADLINE> India Changes Stand on "Safe Passage to Infiltrators" </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW DELHI, June 3 (Xinhua) -- The Indian government Thursday
changed its stand on provision of safe passage to what is called
infiltrators from Pakistan.
</P>
<P>
"There is no question of safe passage to armed intruders who
have committed aggression," a spokesman of the External Affairs
Ministry told the press here Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Indian caretaker Prime Minister Atal Behari Vajpayee and
Defense Minister George Fernandes had said earlier that New Delhi
would consider a "safe passage to infiltrators" from the other
side of the line of control (LoC) in Kargil sector of Kashmir for
retreating to their side if there was a plea for it.
</P>
<P>
"I have been authorized to state by the government that the
prime minister was misquoted and the defense minister quoted out
of context," the spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
Asked why there had been a change in the government's stand, he
said, "I am just trying to set the record straight. What I have
stated is the stand of the government."
</P>
<P>
On the proposed visit by Pakistani Foreign Minister Sartaj Aziz
to India, the spokesman said, "We are trying to fix a date through
diplomatic channels."
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, a military source reportedly said that Indian troops
achieved a major breakthrough Thursday when they dislodged the
so-called infiltrators from seven to nine positions in Batalik
sub-sector along the LoC.
</P>
<P>
On the tenth day of the ongoing conflict between India and
Pakistan, there has been no sign of ceasefire in Kashmir although
there is a reconciliatory gesture from Islamabad Thursday evening
by releasing an Indian pilot captured during an air strike last
week and India had agreed to a visit by the Pakistani foreign
minister to defuse what Indian leaders described as a war-like
situation in the area.

<TEXT>
<P>
LAUSANNE, Switzerland, June 3 (Xinhua) -- Nestle SA's sales in
1998 was 72 billion Swiss francs (about 50 billion U.S. dollars),
head of the Swiss food company Helmut Maucher said here Thursday.
</P>
<P>
In spite of the financial crises which affected many different
areas of the world, Chairman of the board Maucher said, "our
company managed to maintain the profit margin at 6% and, adverse
operating conditions notwithstanding, the drop in operating margins
was very small".
</P>
<P>
He made the remarks at the annual meeting of the shareholders
of his company.
</P>
<P>
Maucher also told the shareholders that the sales in 1999 have
been accelerating since April after a slow start.
</P>
<P>
"Since April, our figures have noticeably improved and we see a
positive accelerating trend which should persist over the rest of
the year," he said.
</P>
<P>
"This makes us look at 1999 with cautious optimism and, unless
currencies and other factors take an unforeseen bad turn, we shall
once again improve sales and profit for the year as a whole," he
went on.
</P>
<P>
More than 2,000 shareholders from home and abroad attended the
one-day meeting.

<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, June 3 (Xinhua) -- Hundreds of thousands of supporters
of the Indonesian Democratic Party of Struggle staged their final
campaign here Thursday, plunging the city into a "sea of red".
</P>
<P>
The party's motorcade began going around the city early in the
morning while waiting for party chairwoman Megawati Soekarnoputri,
eldest daughter of Indonesia's first president Soekarno, to
deliver a speech at the Kemayoran field at noon.
</P>
<P>
In her speech, Megawati called on her supporters not to sell
their votes to other parties in exchange for money.
</P>
<P>
The June 7 election is crucial as it offers a chance for the
country to establish a clean government which everyone will
respect, Megawati said.
</P>
<P>
Waving flags, honking horns and banging drums, the Indonesian
Democratic Party of Struggle supporters, wearing the party's red
color, yelled their support for Megawati.
</P>
<P>
The party supporters gathered at the Hotel Indonesia Circle at
the heart of Jakarta's business center to put up a giant banner
which read "A call for the people to choose the party in the June
7 parliamentary election."
</P>
<P>
The election campaign ends Friday after ruling Golkar Party and
nine other minor parties stage their final campaigns.
</P>
<P>
A two-day "cooling-off" period will precede the general
election next Monday.

<HEADLINE> Russian Envoy Returns From Belgrade Trip </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, June 3 (Xinhua) -- Russian envoy for the Balkans Viktor
Chernomyrdin returned here Thursday from Belgrade, where he and
Finnish President Martti Ahtisaari apparently won the agreement
from the Yugoslav leadership to a peace plan for Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
Chernomyrdin told reporters at the airport that the Balkan
settlement process had been brought into a U.N. legal plane. He
urged the U.N. Security Council to pass a corresponding resolution
as soon as possible.
</P>
<P>
Prior to Chernomyrdin's departure from Belgrade, his adviser,
Valentin Sergeyev, said NATO military officials may arrive in the
Yugoslav capital in the near future, "and maybe within the next 24
hours," to monitor the implementation of the peace plan.
</P>
<P>
The NATO military visit was agreed during a telephone
conversation between Chernomyrdin and U.S. Deputy Secretary of
State Strobe Talbott, the Interfax new agency quoted Sergeyev as
saying.
</P>
<P>
"The NATO generals, who will arrive in Belgrade under the aegis
of the United Nations, will have to start putting into practice
the peace plan for...Kosovo that has been worked out in Bonn,"
Sergeyev said.
</P>
<P>
The plan, hammered out after protracted talks among
Chernomyrdin, Ahtisaari and Strobe WedneshX&AMP;Gtday, calls for the
withdrawal of Serbian troops from Kosovo and the safe return of
ethnic Albanian refugees to the province.
</P>
<P>
"The date and time of the alliance generals' arrival in
Belgrade under the U.N. aegis will be the date and time that the
bombings stop," Sergeyev said.
</P>
<P>
Russia also plans to send military specialists to Yugoslavia,
and Chernomyrdin has obtained Talbott's consent on this, Sergeyev
said.
</P>
<P>
In addition, Sergeyev said, representatives of the Russian
Defense Ministry and General Staff representatives arriving in
Belgrade soon to arrange for a withdrawal of the Serbian troops
from Kosovo "will be accountable only to the Russian military
leadership."

<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, June 3 (Xinhua) -- South African
president-in-waiting Thabo Mbeki Thursday spoke highly of the June
2 all-race elections, the second since 1994, in which the ruling
African National Congress (ANC) has won at least 65 percent of the
votes.
</P>
<P>
Addressing a mass rally at Gallagher Estate in Midrand, Mbeki
described the latest general elections as "free and fair", which,
he said, had provided the South African people a new opportunity
to speak.
</P>
<P>
Some 18.1 million people reportedly cast their votes between
7:00 in the morning and 9:00 in the evening Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Mbeki, currently deputy president of the state, praised the
development of national democratic process that started in 1994,
noting that "Democracy is indeed living in South Africa".
</P>
<P>
He called on the peoples of the whole country to cooperate each
other, and to make contributions to national democracy, peace and
prosperity.
</P>
<P>
He pledged that his party and government would continue its
national reconciliation policy and do their best to improve
economy in the country.
</P>
<P>
The improvement of people's life will be realized sooner rather
than later, he said.
</P>
<P>
About 3,000 ANC members and its supporters participated in the
rally, during which they sang and danced to celebrate the ANC's
overwhelming victory in the elections.

<P>
JOHANNESBURG, June 3 (Xinhua) -- A bomb threat scared away top
African National Congress officials celebrating their party's
imminent election victory near Johannesburg Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Police spokesman Captain Hannes Lombaard confirmed that the dog
unit, the Midrand police and the VIP unit were at the scene and
that ANC president Thabo Mbeki and important guests had been taken
to an area that had already been swept for bombs.
</P>
<P>
He said information was sketchy, but hoped to have more details
later.
</P>
<P>
ANC spokesman Ronnie Mamoepa said: "It's normal procedure...
Don't hype yourself up over nothing."
</P>
<P>
ANC spokesman Thabo Masebe said it was still not clear what had
happened.
</P>
<P>
"We had just completed our function in the ballroom and Thabo
Mbeki had finished speaking when the building was evacuated."
</P>
<P>
However, the mood in the parking area of the sprawling
conference center in Midrand north of Johannesburg remained
jubilant as party members celebrated the ANC victory.
</P>
<P>
Police said they had received a call on their Crime Stop number
at 3: 30pm from a person who warned that there was a bomb at the
complex. Police refuse to reveal whether the caller was male or
female.

<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, June 3 (Xinhua) -- U.S. President Bill Clinton said
on Thursday that Yugoslavia's acceptance of a peace plan for
Kosovo was "welcome", but the U.S.-led NATO would keep on with
bombing this country.
</P>
<P>
Clinton made the statement at the Rose Garden following a
cabinet meeting, at which the Kosovo crisis, among other things,
was the main issue discussed.
</P>
<P>
He said the acceptance by Yugoslav leaders of a peace plan
for Kosovo -- reached in Bonn, Germany, between Russian
presidential envoy Victor Chernomyrdin, Finnish President Martti
Ahtisaari, EU representative for the settlement of the Kosovo
crisis, EU current chairman German Chancellor Gerhard Schroeder
and U.S. Deputy Secretary of State Strobe Talbott -- "is of
course welcome."
</P>
<P>
But he said the United States "must have clarity that the
Serbian leadership has fully accepted these conditions (demanded
by NATO) and intends to fully implement them."
</P>
<P>
"Until then, and until Serb forces begin a verifiable
withdrawal from Kosovo, we will continue to pursue diplomacy,
but we will also continue the military effort that has brought
us to this point," Clinton said.
</P>
<P>
The President said he was to meet with the Joint Chiefs of
Staff to speak about "our planning for the force that would
enter Kosovo when NATO's conditions are met."

<HEADLINE> Greece Criticizes Turkey for Territorial Claims </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ATHENS, June 3 (Xinhua) -- Greece Thursday criticized
neighboring Turkey for the latter's territorial claims in the
eastern Aegean Sea.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a press briefing, Greek government spokesman Yannis
Nikolaou said that as long as Turkey continued to make
intransigent and aggressive statements, it would put itself in a
difficult position in front of the international community.
</P>
<P>
Greece and Turkey, both members of the North Atlantic Treaty
Organization (NATO), have been at odds over decades for their
disputes in the territorial waters, air space limits and the
delimitation of the continental shelf in the Aegean Sea and the
Cyprus problem.
</P>
<P>
In his recent statements, Turkish Foreign Minister Ismail Cem
reiterated Turkey's claims questioning the Greek sovereignty over
a number of uninhabited rocky islets in the eastern Aegean area.
</P>
<P>
Nikolaou stressed once again that Turkey must act in accordance
with international legality and international treaties if it was
to proceed along a European path.
</P>

<HEADLINE> Kenya to Hold Activities to Mark World Environment </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, June 3 (Xinhua) -- Kenya will hold numerous
activities to celebrate the World Environment Day on June 5
together with other parts of the world, in a bid to increase
awareness of environmental protection.
</P>
<P>
One of the major events is a search by the United Nations
Environment Program (UNEP) and the National Environmental
Secretariat of Kenya (NES) for Kenya's top 50 success stories in
the field of environmental activities in rural areas.
</P>
<P>
The names of those chosen will be announced at the district
functions on the World Environment Day.
</P>
<P>
Kenya's national environmental secretariat has also mobilized
schools in the east African country to engage in environmental
activities, including plays and dramas and a national art
competition based on the theme of the World Environment Day.
</P>
<P>
Backed by the UNEP, Kenyan capital Nairobi will plant one
million trees during the year 2000. The "adopt-a-tree" campaign
will be announced soon.
</P>
<P>
The World Environment Day was set by the United Nations General
 Assembly in 1972. This year the main celebrations of the
memorable day are scheduled to take place in Tokyo, Japan.
</P>
<P>
During the celebrations, there will be presentation of the
Global 500 awards given to individuals and organizations,
recognized for their contributions to environmental protection.
</P>
<P>
Some 17 individuals and organizations from 12 countries have
been selected as this year's winners.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Internet Penetration Continues to Grow </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LOS ENGELES, June 3 (Xinhua) -- A total of 67.5 million
personal computers in the United States regularly accessed the
Internet as of January this year, up 50 percent over a year ago,
according to a new report released by marketing company Ziff-Davis
this week.
</P>
<P>
While 31 million home PCs accounted for the largest number of
Internet-connected PCs, the report said, the workplace segment
contributed the highest increase, growing 76 percent last year to
almost 28 million PCs.
</P>
<P>
According to the study based on over 11,000 PC users, 60
percent of U.S. households with a PC accessed the Internet at
year-end 1998, bringing the total to 31.2 million. More than 8
million new U.S. households logged onto the Internet in 1998. This
household penetration growth continues to be fueled by newly
purchased PCs, the report said.
</P>
<P>
E-mail continues to be the top Internet activity among all
types of users and has driven much of the growth of the Internet
to date, the report said. Ziff-Davis analysts said there is a
network effect: the more people on the Internet, the larger the
attraction and value of the Internet for each additional user. The
emergence of cheap PCs has also diminished the cost barriers
associated with connecting to the Internet.

<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, June 3 (Xinhua) -- The U.N. Security Council
Thursday expressed "grave concerns at the dramatic increase of
refugees and internally displaced persons throughout the world."
</P>
<P>
In a statement read to the press here, the president of the
Security Council, Ismalla Babourcarr-Blaise of Gambia, said, the
Security Council members "called upon the international community,
particularly the donor countries, to respond positively to the
United Nations consolidated Inter-Agency Appeals for the drought,
famine and war affected countries in order to alleviate the
plight of refugees and internally displaced persons."
</P>
<P>
"Members of the Security Council emphasized the importance of
the equal treatment of the refugees and internally displaced
persons throughout the world," the statement said.
</P>
<P>
"They called for unhindered access of humanitarian assistance
to civilians in need, the respect of human rights and
international humanitarian law," the statement said.
</P>
<P>
"Members of the Security Council expressed concern at continued
threats to the safety and security of humanitarian personnel and
called upon parties to the conflicts to exercise restraints and
ensure the safety and security of humanitarian workers," the
statement said.
</P>
<P>
"The members of the Council emphasized that humanitarian
problems cannot be adequately addressed unless the underlying
political causes are settled," the statement said.
</P>
<P>
The statement came after the Security Council heard a briefing
by the U.N. Secretariat on the deteriorating humanitarian
situation of Africa and other parts of the world.
</P>
<P>
"The members of the Security Council noted the planned mission
to Afghanistan by the U.N. under-secretary-general, Sergio Veira

<HEADLINE> U.N. Cautiously Welcomes Yugoslav Acceptance of Peace Plan </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, June 3 (Xinhua) -- U.N. Secretary-General Kofi
Annan and other officials on Thursday cautiously welcomed the news
that the Serbian Parliament had voted to accept an international
peace plan for Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
Expressing the feeling, Annan hopes that he would be briefed by
the European Union envoy for Kosovo, President Martti Ahtissari of
Finland on the issue, his spokesman Fred Eckhard told reporters at
a noon briefing here.
</P>
<P>
Annan is due back to New York late Thursday after his scheduled
meeting with Pope John Paul II in Rome in mid-day.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Annan's special envoy for the Balkans Carl Bildt
issued a statement from Geneva Thursday, saying that he welcomed
the news.
</P>
<P>
"There is light on the horizon for the peoples of Kosovo and
the region," he said.
</P>
<P>
"But now the hard and difficult work will start. We must seek
to clarify the principles and as soon as possible start to
implement them," he said.
</P>
<P>
Bildt added that "Peace is more demanding and difficult than
war", as "the machinery for implementing peace is less strong"
than "the machinery for conducting war".
</P>
<P>
Eckhard said U.N. contingency planning for implementation of
the peace plan is accelerating.
</P>
<P>
Bernard Miyet, the Under-Secretary-General for peacekeeping,
returned Wednesday night from Europe, where he discussed the issue
with NATO officials and Bildt.

nations to keep the food aid going smoothly to the central African
region of the Great Lakes.

HONG KONG, June 4 (Xinhua) -- Administrative Secretary Anson
Chan said here today that the general state of health of the Hong
Kong community is good as a result of government efforts combined
with those of the dedicated medical profession.
</P>
<P>
Officiating at the opening ceremony of the 20th Eastern Region
Conference of the International Union Against Tuberculosis and
Lung Disease, Chan said the death rate of tuberculosis in Hong
Kong has dropped from over 2,000 per million people in the 1950s
to less than 40 as of 1998.
</P>
<P>
The death rate of other respiratory diseases such as asthma and
chronic obstructive airway disease has fallen steadily since 1990.
Life expectancy has risen from 68 to 77 years for male and 75 to
82 years for female over the past 25 years, she said.
</P>
<P>
As a result of sustained economic growth, she said: "We have
been able to significantly improve both the quantity and quality
of our health services."
</P>
<P>
However, Hong Kong is still facing two serious challenges.
</P>
<P>
Firstly, the financial sustainability of its system in the long
run.
</P>
<P>
The public health bill this year is estimated to be 30 billion
HK dollars (3.84 billion U.S. dollars) which represents one sixth
of the government's total recurrent expenditure.
</P>
<P>
Chan said it is clear that "we can not sustain such spending in
the long run without crowding out other essential social services
for the community or seriously eroding their quality."
</P>
<P>
Secondly, Hong Kong's current service delivery mode is outdated
with undue emphasis on hospital-dominated curative care.
</P>
<P>
Noting a consensus on the need to reform the system, she said:
"We hope with the tripartite effort of the administration, the
medical profession and members of the public, we will come up with
the right prescription for our community which will ensure health
for all at affordable prices."

<HEADLINE> Medvedev Beats Meligeni for French Open Final </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, June 4 (Xinhua) -- Andrei Medvedev of Ukraine defeated
Fernando Meligeni of Brazil on Friday, become the lowest-ranked
player to reach the final of the French Open.
</P>
<P>
Medvedev, who ranked 100th, outpowered Meligeni 7-5, 3-6, 6-4,
7-6 (8-6) for his first-ever Grand Slam final, as "it means a new
life and means I have come back."
</P>
<P>
A semifinalist in Roland Garros in 1993, Medvedev once ranked
fourth but slipped into oblivion due to injuries.
</P>
<P>
En route to his final, Medvedev had toppled No. 2 Pete Sampras
and 1997 champion Gustavo Kuerten.
</P>
<P>
Yet, against 54th-ranked Meligeni, Medvedev had a slow star by
losing the first four games before winning nine out of the next 10
games to boost his morale.
</P>
<P>
After achieving a 2-0 and 3-1 lead in the second set, Medvedev
was suddenly out of form and Meligeni won five straight games to
even the score at one set apiece.
</P>
<P>
Taking vitamins and minerals during changeovers, the Ukrainian
recovered from a break down to win the third, but blew a 4-0 lead
in the decisive tiebreak which he eventually won by 8-6.
</P>
<P>
In the second semifinal, Andre Agassi was leading Dominik
Hrbaty by taking the first set.

Pinochet, 83, has spent almost a year under house-arrest in
Britain waiting to face a hearing on whether he should be
extradited to Spain.
</P>
<P>
Pinochet was arrested last October in a London hospital where
he was recovering from a minor operation. He is wanted in Spain
on torture charges dating back to his time as Chilean leader from
1973-1990.
</P>
<P>
Judge Graham Parkinson, who set the date and will preside over
the hearing, did not fix a deadline by which Spain must finalize
its case against Pinochet.
</P>
<P>
He urged Spain's lawyers to do so "at the earliest possible
date." In recent weeks, a Spanish judge has filed more cases of
torture against Pinochet, who is currently under house arrest in a
hired mansion in a suburb of London.
</P>
<P>
The hearing is expected to last about a week. Pinochet will not
be required to attend during arguments, but Parkinson has said the

<HEADLINE> U.N. Food Agency Approves Emergency Operation to Help Ethiopians </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GENEVA, June 4 (Xinhua) -- The World Food Program (WFP) has
approved a 40.5-million-U.S.-dollar emergency operation to feed
nearly 1.2 million people desperately in need of food in eight
drought-stricken regions of Ethiopia, the United Nations agency
announced here Friday.
</P>
<P>
Farmers in some areas of Ethiopia have been hurt by an extended
dry spell, caused by the failure of a rainy season that ended in
May, which hindered crop planting, germination and growth,
according to WFP.
</P>
<P>
"The WFP has been very concerned about this problem," said
Judith Lewis, WFP Country Representative for Ethiopia, "We are
acting now to prevent a potentially major humanitarian crisis."
</P>
<P>
WFP's emergency operation, running from June through December,
will provide over 103,000 tons of emergency food aid to the most
vulnerable sectors of the population, namely pregnant and nursing
mothers, children under five, the disabled and the elderly.

<HEADLINE> British Committee Says NATO "Barbaric" to Continue Bombing </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, June 4 (Xinhua) -- A British committee Friday denounced
NATO's decision to continue bombing against Yugoslavia as "
barbaric," and urged the military alliance to stop the airstrikes
immediately.
</P>
<P>
"It is barbaric for NATO to continue to bomb Yugoslavia when
the country's leaders have accepted the terms of a peace
settlement which NATO says are acceptable," the Committee for
Peace in the Balkans, chaired by Alice Mahon, a Parliamentary
Member (MP) from the Labor Party, said in a statement.
</P>
<P>
"NATO states that bombing will continue until the withdrawal of
Yugoslav troops from Kosovo can be 'verified.' Does this mean
that withdrawing Yugoslav forces, and the civilians who will
undoubtedly accompany them, must risk the kind of massacres of
tens of thousands of people which the United States perpetrated
against retreating Iraqi troops and civilians on the Basra road
after Iraq had accepted U.S. terms for settling that war?" Mahon
asked.
</P>
<P>
"In the name of humanity, NATO must stop bombing immediately,"
the statement said.Mahon insisted that the bombing must stop "to
allow the peace settlement to proceed."
</P>
<P>
The Committee for Peace in the Balkans was established in 1991
to promote peace and reconciliation in the region. A number of
British MPs are members of the committee.

<P>
ROME, June 4 (Xinhua) -- Italian Foreign Minister Lamberto Dini
said Friday that the NATO bombing against Yugoslavia could stop on
Sunday if the withdrawal of Yugoslav forces from Kosovo has
started by then.
</P>
<P>
Dini said in Cologne, Germany, where the European Union (EU)
summit was held, that "this would be in line with the accords
reached," according to the Italian news agency ANSA.
</P>
<P>
Italian Prime Minister Massimo D'Alema said Friday in Cologne
that NATO's bombardment of targets in Kosovo will stop as soon as
the agreement is reached on the details of a Yugoslav pull-out and
the entry of the international peacekeeping troops.
</P>
<P>
"Military operations in Kosovo will cease the moment when
technical details are established regarding the withdrawal of Serb
forces and the entry of the peace-keeping force," D'Alema said on
the sidelines of the EU summit.
</P>
<P>
Referring to the EU agreement on Solana as its future
representative on foreign policy and security, D'Alema said the
union has taken "important steps."

<HEADLINE> Barak Presents Coalition Policy Guidelines </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, June 4 (Xinhua) -- Israeli Prime Minister-elect
Ehud Barak accelerated coalition building Friday by presenting his
policy guidelines to potential coalition partners.
</P>
<P>
His negotiation team put forward an 11-page document containing
vague principles on some important issues to the left-wing Meretz,
the right-wing National Religious Party (NRP), the ultra-Orthodox
party United Torah Judaism (UTJ) and the immigrant party Yisrael
B'Aliya, Israel Radio said.
</P>
<P>
Barak pledged in the guidelines that his government would
provide "full services" to existing Jewish settlements scattered in
the West Bank and Gaza Strip, but would annul the preferential
treatment they enjoyed under the government of outgoing Prime
Minister Benjamin Netanyahu.
</P>
<P>
Meretz has called for a full freeze in expansion of settlements
but the NRP, an advocate of the settlement movement, demanded the
"natural growth" of the settlements.
</P>
<P>
The Palestinians have voiced their strong concern over the
intensified settlement expansion over the last few months, urging
Barak to take measures to curb these activities which they said
would kill the peace process.
</P>
<P>
On the issue of the drafting of religious students, Barak
retreated from his initial position, saying only that he would
try to reach an agreement which would recognize the demands of
these students.
</P>
<P>
Barak had called for the drafting of the religious students
before the general elections last month. He presented such a bill
last year to the parliament but was scuttled.
</P>
<P>
The UTJ, along with another ultra-religious party Shas, have
opposed to any changes to the status quo religious parties
reached with the government 51 years ago when the state of
Israel was proclaimed, under which religious students would be
exempted from the military service.
</P>
<P>
When the status quo agreement was signed in 1948, the number of
religious students exempted from the military service was several
hundred, now it has grown to near 30,000.
</P>
<P>
The guidelines also said the government would build a national
consensus on the drawing up of a constitution. Because of internal
disputes on the identity of the Jewish state, Israel has failed to
work out a constitution and is operating under several
semi-constitutional basic laws.
</P>
<P>
Meretz criticized the policy guidelines "too general" and
"non-committal."
</P>
<P>
Barak, who won a landslide victory in the elections, has
promised to build a broad-based government in order to make tough
decisions on the peace process and heal the internal rifts in this
much divided country.
</P>
<P>
But the Likud, the former ruling party and the second largest
bloc in the next parliament, was split among its members on
whether to join his government.
</P>
<P>
Barak will meet outgoing Foreign Minister Ariel Sharon, the
temporary leader of the Likud after Netanyahu resigned his
leadership, again Sunday. In their talks Wednesday night, the two
failed to reach agreement but pledged to continue discussions.
</P>
<P>
The biggest barrier Barak faces in the coalition talks is
whether to include Shas, a party representing low-income Jews of
Middle East origin which surprisingly jumped from 10 seats in
the outgoing parliament to 17 seats and secured the third position
after Barak's One Israel alliance and the Likud, in his government.
</P>
<P>
Meretz and Shinui, a secular movement party which was newly
elected to the parliament on a platform against what it called
religious coercion, have said they would not sit with Shas in
any government.
</P>
<P>
Barak, who hinted that he wants Shas in his government, has
demanded that Shas leader Aryeh Deri, who was sentenced to four
years in jail in April for bribe-taking and breaching of public
trust, have to give up his leadership before Shas could talk about
joining the coalition.
</P>
<P>
Deri, who is free pending a High Court rule on his appeal, has
announced his resignation from the next parliament but remained
the leader of Shas.
</P>
<P>
Barak, obliged to put together a governing coalition before
early July, said Deri's move was not enough.

<HEADLINE> Schroeder Demands Quick Implementation of Kosovo Peace Plan </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
COLOGNE, June 4 (Xinhua) -- German Chancellor Gerhard Schroeder
called for the quick implementation of the Kosovo peace plan
Friday, saying it was the right time for NATO to stop the
airstrikes against Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
"Now there is a realistic chance of peace," Schroeder said at a
press conference at the end of a two-day European Union Cologne
summit.
</P>
<P>
He stressed the next week would be "very critical," with the
fact that it was not an easy mission, even for a robust
peacekeeping force, to settle the situation in that region.
</P>
<P>
Nevertheless, the de-escalation of the Kosovo crisis has
already begun, Schroeder said, adding that military experts from
both sides, the Western and Yugoslavian, would meet this weekend.
</P>
<P>
The peacekeeping force to be deployed in Kosovo should have a
single command structure as has been written in the plan, he said.
</P>
<P>
Schroeder expressed his thanks to Russian President Boris
Yeltsin and his envoy Viktor Chernomyrdin, who had negotiated the
peace plan with the Yugoslav leadership.
</P>
<P>
He applauded the EU's Employment Pact as an instrument to
secure new job opportunities, saying it was necessary for EU
states to coordinate more in economic and financial policies. The
EU leaders passed the pact on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The Cologne summit is the starting point for the process of
emerging for the EU and the Western European Union (WEU),
Schroeder said, referring to EU's common foreign and security
policy that was passed on Thursday.

<HEADLINE> Greece Hopes to Play Role in Peacekeeping Force Command </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ATHENS, June 4 (Xinhua) -- Greek Defense Minister Akis
Tsohatzopoulos said Friday that Athens was pressing to play a role
in the command structure in the multinational peacekeeping force
to be deployed in the Yugoslav province of Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
Speaking after talks with his visiting Georgian counterpart,
Vardiko Nadibaidze, in the northern Greek city of Thessaloniki,
Tsohatzopoulos said that Greece would contribute more troops than
the battalion already committed to the multinational peacekeeping
force, the semi-official Athens News Agency (ANA) reported.
</P>
<P>
He said that Thursday's agreement had proven to all those who
believed that diplomacy was the only road to results.
</P>
<P>
While warning that stability in Kosovo would be a long-term
process, the minister hoped that NATO and Yugoslav military
officials should immediately begin talks on the issues of the
withdrawal of Serb forces from Kosovo as well as on the beginning
of the peace-making process.
</P>
<P>
On Saturday, a Greek delegation will participate in the talks
between NATO and Yugoslavia at the Yugoslav-Macedonian border on
the terms of the implementation of the agreement, which was
presented jointly by Russia, the European Union (EU) and the
United States for peacefully resolving the conflict in Yugoslavia.

LONDON -- A British judge on Friday set September 27 as the
date for the start of extradition hearings against former Chilean
leader Augusto Pinochet.
</P>
<P>
Pinochet, 83, has spent almost a year under house-arrest in
Britain waiting to face a hearing on whether he should be
extradited to Spain.
</P>
<P>
Pinochet was arrested last October in a London hospital where
he was recovering from a minor operation. He is wanted in Spain
on torture charges dating back to his time as Chilean leader from
1973-1990.
</P>
<P>
Judge Graham Parkinson, who set the date and will preside over
the hearing, did not fix a deadline by which Spain must finalize
its case against Pinochet.
</P>
<P>
He urged Spain's lawyers to do so "at the earliest possible
date." In recent weeks, a Spanish judge has filed more cases of
torture against Pinochet, who is currently under house arrest in a
hired mansion in a suburb of London.
</P>
<P>
The hearing is expected to last about a week. Pinochet will not
be required to attend during arguments, but Parkinson has said the
general must be present when his decision is announced. (Britain-

<HEADLINE> Released Indian Pilot Back Home </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW DELHI, June 4 (Xinhua) -- Indian Flight Lieutenant K.
Nachiketa, who was released by Pakistan Thursday night, crossed
the border line between the two countries and arrived at 17:17
p.m. Friday to the Indian border town of Wagah, reported the Press
Trust of India (PTI).
</P>
<P>
Nachiketa, who was captured on May 27 during an air strike
against what India described as infiltrators in the disputed
Kashmir, walked into the Indian side through the gates at the
joint border road checkpoint along with some officials of the
Indian High Commission in Pakistan.
</P>
<P>
He was received, among others, by high-ranking officers of the
Indian Air Force and Border Security Force and civil and police
institutions, PTI reported from Wagah.
</P>
<P>
Nachiketa was captured by Pakistan forces after he strayed into
the Line of Control when he baled out of his MiG-27 fighter
following a technical snag, said Indian military sources.
</P>
<P>
Reports from Islamabad said the Indian pilot was interviewed
for two hours by officials of the International Committee of Red
Cross after he was handed over to them in Islamabad Thursday
night.
</P>
<P>
Nachiketa was driven down from Islamabad to Wagah in the
northeast state of Punjab from where he was taken to Raja Sansi
Airport in the border city of Amritsar, said PTI.
</P>
<P>
He was not allowed to speak to the assembled mediamen, but he
said he was fine when asked how he was feeling.
</P>
<P>
He also said that he was ready to go on his next sortie even
after spending eight days in captivity in Pakistan.
</P>
<P>
A special aircraft has been arranged to bring him to New Delhi
late Friday evening, sources from the Indian Air Force said.
</P>
<P>
India expressed delight Thursday night at the release of the
pilot.

<HEADLINE> Pakistan Repulses More Indian Attacks in Kashmir </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, June 4 (Xinhua) -- The Indian troops in the
Kargil-Drass sector in Kashmir fired on the Pakistani troops and
tried to move forward but were forced to retreat again after
suffering a number of casualties, said a Pakistani military
spokesman Friday.
</P>
<P>
The Indian air force also continued its air strikes and two or
three bombs fell on the Pakistani side of the Line of Control
(LoC), said Brigadier Rashid Qureshi, director general of the
Inter-Service Public Relations (ISPR), in an interview with Radio
Pakistan.
</P>
<P>
Giving reasons of the increased Indian army firing in the
Kargil-Drass sector, Qureshi said Pakistani troops are holding
strategic positions overlooking a highway through which the Indian
army in the entire Siachin glacier area is being supplied.
</P>
<P>
The Indians want to push back the Pakistani troops from their
positions to secure this highway but have badly failed in their
repeated attempts, said Qureshi.
</P>
<P>
He said India has concentrated about 20,000 troops in this area
and there are reports that they are beefing up those troops with
additional five to ten thousands of men.
</P>
<P>
The Indian side has lost nearly 150 soldiers since the current
hostilities began, said the ISPR director general.
</P>
<P>
To a question, he said U.N. observers on the Pakistani side of
the LoC are free to go anywhere and they are noticing the Indian
firing.
</P>
<P>
On the contrary, their counterparts in Srinagar, capital of
Indian-controlled Kashmir, are not allowed to move out of the city
so that they could not judge the real situation, he said.

<HEADLINE> PCs in China Getting Cheaper in Midst of Price Wars </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, June 4 (Xinhua) -- The Chinese people will soon find
that personal computers are cheaper thanks to a price war between
Chinese manufacturers that has gone on for several months.
</P>
<P>
The price of the latest model of computer with the Pentium III
processor has dropped to below 10,000 yuan (1,200 U.S. dollars) as
Chinese manufacturers compete with each other for a larger market
share.
</P>
<P>
But, the Chinese are still indifferent to computer sales and
many are waiting for a further drop in prices this year, according
to Xu Shijun, of the Taiji Computer Co.
</P>
<P>
Xu said that one of the most important causes of the price war
was when Intel's PIII price dropped by 30 percent in the past two
months.
</P>
<P>
Worries about the Y2K problem have also weakened Chinese
desires to buy computers right away and many people say they won't
spend a cent until early next year, Xu said. In addition, computer
prices are still too high for the average Chinese family in spite
of their growing interest in computers.

<HEADLINE> S. African Opposition Party Leader Offers to Quit </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, June 4 (Xinhua) -- Leader of South Africa's
opposition Freedom Front (FF), Constand Viljoen, Friday offered to
resign because of his party's poor performance in Wednesday's
elections.
</P>
<P>
South African Press Association quoted Viljoen as saying in
Pretoria that he would consult fellow Afrikaners on his future,
and make a decision by the end of August.
</P>
<P>
"I can hardly claim to have a mandate from the entire Afrikaner
 community," Viljoen said.
</P>
<P>
"I have no desire to remain in politics if it does not hold
benefits for the Afrikaner, but as long as I can play a useful
role, I would like to make my services available.
</P>
<P>
"I am not eager to give up my position, but this will depend on
my consultations with Afrikaners," he said.
</P>
<P>
He said the party's leadership structures would also be
rearranged as soon as possible, and a critical analysis would be
undertaken of mistakes the FF had made.
</P>
<P>
The FF would continue advancing the principle of
self-determination among Afrikaners and other cultural groups such
as the Khoisan, he said.
</P>
<P>
Should he decide to resign, Viljoen said, he would continue
trying to " rebuild the Afrikaner nation" in another capacity.
</P>
<P>
Viljoen said the FF's provisional ballot count of about
125,000, did not influence the importance the party attached to
the concept of self- determination -- which he described as a
conflict prevention mechanism for South Africa.
</P>
<P>
The preliminary results did prove, however, that Afrikaners
were more concerned about burning issues such as crime, education,
economic growth, and affirmative action.
</P>
<P>
"Many Afrikaners turned to the Democratic Party with its
confrontational politics, because they believed it could best
address their immediate concerns."
</P>
<P>
He said the whites had grouped around the DP because of a
perceived danger of black one-party domination.
</P>
<P>
Another contributing factor to the FF's poor performance was
the formation of parties such as the Afrikaner Eenheidsbeweging
(Afrikaner Unity Movement) and the Federal Alliance, which had
divided the Afrikaner vote, Viljoen said.
</P>
<P>
The FF would now opt for an alliance with other opposition
parties.
</P>
<P>
"We will consider all options. The only condition is that self-
determination must not be rejected as a principle."
</P>
<P>
Viljoen congratulated parties which had performed well,
including the African National Congress, and urged them to always
serve the best interests of the country.
</P>
<P>
He lamented what he described as the poor condition the
Afrikaner nation was in, saying a low point of confusion had been
reached.
</P>
<P>
"But our foundation is solid. We will be free again from
domination, even though we are currently totally disempowered," he
said.

opening up and will put more emphasis on new projects, Yang said.
</P>
<P>
Guangxi will soon cooperate with the central government in a

<HEADLINE> Cyprus Issue Stands Priority for Europe: CoE </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NICOSIA, June 4 (Xinhua) -- The solution to the Cyprus issue
will be a priority for Europe, Walter Schwimmer, candidate for the
Secretary General of the Council of Europe (CoE) said Friday.
</P>
<P>
Schwimmer, who is here on his tour of European capitals ahead
of elections at the Council, said the Council is continuing the
dialogue with Turkey persuading it to respond positively to plans
for a solution in the line of the U.N. Security Council
resolutions.
</P>
<P>
After meeting with Cyprus' Parliament President Spyros
Kyprianou, Schwimmer said the Council has sent a clear message to
Turkey that it can not "accept a dividing line and a wall, like
the Berlin wall, in the capital of the Republic of Cyprus."
</P>
<P>
Cyprus has been divided into the Turkish Cypriots-controlled
north and the Greek Cypriots-dominated south since 1974 when
Turkish troops invaded and occupied the northern third of the
island in the wake of a failed coup seeking union with Athens.
</P>
<P>
On his part, Kyprianou reiterated the view that the Cyprus
issue cannot go on for ever unresolved, nor can the current status
quo be continued.
</P>
<P>
"It has to be settled at some stage in an effective manner on
the basis of international law, the U.N. Charter and
U.N. resolutions," he said.

ANKARA, June 4 (Xinhua) -- Turkey welcomes Yugoslavia's

Ministry in a statement Friday.
</P>
<P>
The development was "important and hopeful" for the
establishment of peace in the region, said the statement.
</P>

It pointed out that Kosovar refugees would be able to return to
Kosovo with the implementation of the peace deal, which was
accepted by Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic and the Serb
parliament Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The number of Kosovar refugees in Turkey has reached near
17,000 since NATO launched air strikes against Yugoslavia on
March 24.
</P>
<P>
Turkey sincerely wishes the peace plan to be implemented soon

<HEADLINE> Conny Takes First Gold for Germany at FINA Diving GP </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, June 4 (Xinhua) -- Germany's Conny Schmalfuss
clinched the first gold for her country this season by beating
World Cup champion Zhang Jing in the women's one-meter springboard
at the Hong Kong Diving Meet which opened here on Friday.
</P>
<P>
Wang Tianling of China was crowned in the men's one-meter
springboard with 401.76 points.
</P>
<P>
"I am lucky to win the title because Zhang made a big mistake
in the last dive," said 23-year-old student Conny, who championed
in the three-meter synchronized springboard at the 1997 world
championship.
</P>
<P>
Conny, ranked second in the first four dives, collected 265.44
points to top the table while Australian Chantelle Michell was
second with 253.74 points. The bronze medal went to Conny's
teammate Sandra Kloss with 253.14 points.
</P>
<P>
Zhang Jing, who won World Cup early this year in New Zealand,
led all the way before making a big mistake in the fifth and last
dive.
</P>
<P>
"I was wrong-footed in the board," said a disappointed Zhang
who came fifth with 237.84 points.
</P>
<P>
The men's one-meter springboard competition became an all
Chinese affair when China's Wang Tianling and Yu Zhoucheng led all
the way to the top two from the very start.
</P>
<P>
Wang, ranked second in World Cup this year, took the lead after
the fourth dive by surpassing his compatriot Yu Zhoucheng, who
took the silver with a difference of 1.68 points.
</P>
<P>
Twenty-three-year-old Yu, who finished first at the World
Championship last year in Perth, got 81.10 points in the sixth 405
B dive, the highest score of the day.
</P>
<P>
American Patrick Bogart ranked third by collecting 366.39
points.
</P>
<P>
The three-day meet, the ninth leg of the 14-leg FINA Diving

</P>
<P>
-- President Clinton cautiously welcomed word of Yugoslavia's

<HEADLINE> EDS-Details Added Chinese President Meets With DPRK Leader in Beijing (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, June 4 (Xinhua) -- President Jiang Zemin said here
today in a meeting with Kim Yong Nam, president of the Presidium
of the Supreme People's Assembly of the Democratic People's
Republic of Korea (DPRK), that the Chinese Communist Party and
government will continue to promote the Sino-DPRK traditional
friendship as part of China's unswerving policy.
</P>
<P>
Jiang said he hopes that China and the DPRK can make a
concerted effort and face the future and bring bilateral friendly
relations into the next century.
</P>
<P>
He said that the two countries have had a profound exchange of
views on strengthening and promoting bilateral relations and
reached consensus during Kim's visit since Thursday, adding that
he is glad about this.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese Party and government have always treasured this
friendship and both countries are building socialism according to
their own circumstances, Jiang said.
</P>
<P>
In the current complicated and changeable international
situation, improving this bilateral traditional friendship is in
the interest of the people of the two countries and conducive to
peace and stability in the region and the world.
</P>
<P>
China and Korea are close neighbors, Jiang emphasized, saying
that China has always tried to secure peace and stability on the
Korean Peninsula, and this is a fundamental principle China
upholds in this matter.

<P>
Kim reiterated that the DPRK supports China's reforms and
opening up, saying that he has seen the great achievements brought
about by the reforms and economic construction and that this
demonstrates that China's building socialism with Chinese
characteristics is suited to its own circumstances.
</P>
<P>
The DPRK is happy about this and values these achievements, he
added.
</P>
<P>
He went on to say that the Chinese Party and government have
made an effort to secure domestic stability and unity, safeguard
peace and oppose hegemonism, which has won the country greater
international prestige.
</P>
<P>
The return of Hong Kong and Macao will serve to further promote
China's reunification efforts, Kim said, and the DPRK
congratulates China on this.
</P>
<P>
Chinese Foreign Minister Tang Jiaxuan and the head of the
Communist Party of China Central Committee's International
Department, Dai Binguo, along with the DPRK's Premier Hong Song
Nam were present at today's meeting.
</P>
<P>
Kim arrived here Thursday morning for a five-day official
goodwill visit at the invitation of the Standing Committee of the
Chinese National People's Congress and the State Council.
</P>
<P>
The DPRK delegation is expected to leave tomorrow for Hangzhou,
a scenic city in Zhejiang Province in east China.

Jiang said that China supports the move by both sides of the
peninsula toward peaceful reunification without external
interference and hopes that they improve relations. China also
supports the DPRK to improve relations with the United States,
Japan, and the European Union, and ultimately normalize bilateral
relations.
</P>
<P>
After the Cold War, he said, the world began moving towards
multipolarization, but it is still far from being peaceful and
mankind is at an important moment in the safeguarding of world
peace and promoting common development.
</P>
<P>
At present, Jiang pointed out, one important task of the people
the world over is opposing hegemonism and power politics and
helping establish a fair and reasonable new international
political and economic order.
</P>
<P>
Kim passed on Kim Jong Il's best regards and said the Sino-DPRK
traditional friendship was established by an older generation of
leaders like Chairman Mao Zedong, Premier Zhou Enlai and President
Kim Il Sung.
</P>
<P>
It is the persistent stand of Kim Jong Il and the Workers'
Party of Korea to improve this friendship that has withstood the
test of time and is of great vitality, he added.
</P>
<P>
The DPRK hopes that both nations can make a joint effort to
further develop the bilateral traditional friendship in the light
of his visit and the 50th anniversary of diplomatic ties between
the two nations, Kim said.

<HEADLINE> NATO De-Escalation of Airstrikes Has Started: Schroeder </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
COLOGNE, June 4 (Xinhua) -- German Chancellor Gerhard Schroeder
said here on Friday that NATO warplanes had begun a policy of de-
escalating airstrikes on Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
"De-escalation has already begun," said Schroeder at a press
conference toward the end of a two-day European Union Summit.
</P>
<P>
He said the Western military alliance would suspend its bombing
campaign after it had verified that the withdrawal of Yugoslav
forces from Kosovo was proceeding.
</P>
<P>
"We must now set everything in movement to speed up this
process," said the chancellor who later called for a United
Nations Security Council resolution to cover the deployment of an
international peace-keeping force in the Yugoslav province.
</P>
<P>
Schroeder said the foreign ministers of the Group of Eight
countries would meet in Cologne this Sunday to work on the text of
the resolution.
</P>
<P>
The German chancellor told the press that he had made telephone
calls to Russian President Boris Yeltsin and Chinese Premier Zhu
Rongji on Friday.
</P>
<P>
Both China and Russia have veto rights on the United Nations
Security Council.
</P>
<P>
French President Jacques Chirac also said on Friday that NATO
would limit its strikes if conditions for a suspension were met.
</P>
<P>
British Prime Minister Tony Blair, however, again stressed that
Yugoslavia had to demonstrate its commitment to peace before the
Western military alliance called off its attacks on the Balkan
country.
</P>
<P>
"Hopefully, we are at the beginning of the end," said Blair at
the end of the two-day summit which was dominated by the
acceptance by Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic of the Group
of Eight peace plan.
</P>
<P>
Blair reaffirmed that NATO airstrikes against Yugoslavia could
continue until the withdrawal of Yugoslav forces from Kosovo had
been verified.
</P>
<P>
NATO continued its bombing campaign on Yugoslavia on Thursday
and Friday despite the fact that the Yugoslav government and
parliament had both accepted the peace plan worked out by the
Group of Eight in Bonn earlier last month.

<HEADLINE> Roundup: Philippine Airlines Averts Closure </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, June 4 (Xinhua) -- The beleaguered Philippine Airlines
(PAL) finally averts the closure fate by getting the much needed
new investment of 200 million U.S. dollars Friday, meeting the
June 4 deadline set by the Philippine Securities and Exchange
Commission (SEC).
</P>
<P>
SEC Chairman Perfecto Yasay Jr. announced Friday morning the
final completion of the 200 million U.S. dollars as additional
capital, which paves the way for the implementation of the
national flag carrier's rehabilitation plan.
</P>
<P>
The said amount has been deposited with the Allied Bank under
PAL's name and can now be utilized by cash-strapped PAL for its
operations in accordance with the approved rehabilitation plan.
</P>
<P>
The inflow of 200 million U.S. dollar in fresh capital equity
ended a long and extensive search for new funding for PAL.
</P>
<P>
The 58-year-old flag carrier has been unable to repay more than
2.2 billion U.S. dollars in debts because of a crippling pilot's
strike and an ill-timed refleeting program.
</P>
<P>
PAL's bold modernization and refleeting program, launched in
1997, was undertaken in response to competitive challenges and to
take advantage of booming travel growth trends. Its aim was to
transform PAL into a major player in the Asian aviation scene in
three years.
</P>
<P>
But the Asian financial crisis starting in mid-1997 stymied the
program and led to the downsizing of most airlines in the region,
including PAL.
</P>
<P>
After the original rehabilitation plan in December 1998 was
roundly rejected by creditors, PAL submitted an amended plan in
March 1999 incorporating many of the creditors' recommendations,
foremost of which was the investment of 200 million U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
The airline had faced possible liquidation with its creditors
threatening to foreclose on several aircraft before the
rehabilitation plan was approved on the condition 200 million U.S.
dollars in new equity be infused by June 4.
</P>
<P>
PAL's rehabilitation plan also calls a reduction of the
airline's fleet from 54 to 22 planes and sharp cuts in its
workforce, which currently numbers about 8,000.
</P>
<P>
On May 18, the Philippines SEC approved in principle the
amended rehabilitation plan for the PAL following a meeting with
members of the Interim Rehabilitation Receiver set up earlier for
PAL.
</P>
<P>
At that meeting, creditors accounting for 55 percent of PAL's
debts backed the PAL rehabilitation program.
</P>
<P>
Of the 200 million dollars' fresh capital, Tan himself infused
a total of 100 million U.S. dollars, while 70 million U.S. dollars
came from the Hong Kong Investments Company and 30 million U.S.
dollars came from two Filipino firms.
</P>
<P>
Tan had hoped earlier to receive 30 million U.S. dollars from
government financial institutions (GFIs) which hold a 15 percent
stake in the flag carrier, but the GFIs finally refused to infuse
fresh capital despite dilution of their holdings in the airline.
</P>
<P>
To save the PAL, Tan also made an offer to transfer for free
60,000 shares of stock, worth 60,000 pesos (1,600 U.S. dollars) to
PAL's employees, in exchange for 10-year moratorium on strikes.
</P>
<P>
The strike moratorium is a key condition of prospective
investors before they infuse fresh capital into the ailing
airline.
</P>
<P>
All 898 of PAL's administrative staff, 3,400 of the
5,504-strong Philippine Airlines Employees Association and all but
one of the airline's pilots have already signed up to receive
their stock certificates at various distribution points.
</P>
<P>
The Department of Labor and Employment also declared on June 3
that the 22-day strike by the Airline Pilots Association of the
Philippines last year was illegal and affirmed the fact that the
strikers had lost their employment status with PAL, which gave
some confidence to PAL's creditors.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Philippine President Joseph Estrada said once again
that "PAL will keep on flying" as long as he is the president. He
also said the government would take over the task of looking for
new investors should Tan fail to raise the required money.
</P>
<P>
The Philippine government expressed confidence Friday that with
the removal of the financial baggage that has threatened to ground
its fleet, PAL can continue flying.
</P>
<P>
Philippine Vice President Gloria Arroyo said there appears to
be no more major issue weighing down PAL's operation as the
airline's rehabilitation program would now automatically proceed.
</P>
<P>
With the coming of the additional investment, SEC Chairman
Yasay said Friday morning that the SEC will be issuing an order
creating a permanent rehabilitation receiver whose major task is
to monitor and supervise strictly the implementation of the
rehabilitation plan.
</P>
<P>
In accordance with this, the receiver committee has the
responsibility of informing the SEC and the creditors of any
deviation from the rehabilitation plan.
</P>
<P>
Yasay expressed optimism that the problem that hounds PAL can
now be put to rest. But he expected the full cooperation of the
parties involved to fully support the rehabilitation plan so that
PAL can efficiently resume its normal operations.

<HEADLINE> Southern Chinese Province Reducing Cost of Power </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GUANGZHOU, June 4 (Xinhua) -- The southern Chinese province of
Guangdong has had some success in reducing various fees over the
past two years.
</P>
<P>
By the end of 1998, it had canceled 4,000 different fees for a
total of 11 billion yuan (about 1.3 billion U.S. dollars).
</P>
<P>
It focused its efforts on lowering the cost of electricity and
telecommunications services. Four cost reductions, for example,
helped lower the cost of electricity in the province to customers
by 0.1 yuan per kilowatt-hour, for a total savings to customers of
6.68 billion yuan.
</P>
<P>
To expand the cost-cutting policy, the provincial government
made certain that all departments concerned were aware of this and
published it in local newspapers.
</P>
<P>
It also sent out inspection teams to all counties and cities to
make certain that the program was working.

<HEADLINE> ECB Should Be Main Voice for Euro: Schroeder </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
COLOGNE, June 4 (Xinhua) -- German Federal Chancellor Gerhard
Schroeder said on Friday that the European Central Bank (ECB)
should speak as the official voice on the single currency.
</P>
<P>
The chancellor, whose country is serving the rotating six-month
presidency of the 15-nation European Union (EU), said after a two-
day EU Summit that EU finance ministers should coordinate their
comments on the euro in the future.
</P>
<P>
"In the future, European Central Bank President Wim Duisenberg
should speak as the official voice on the euro," said the German
chancellor.
</P>
<P>
Economists have complained about the often differing statements
by different European leaders on the single currency, which came
into being in January this year.
</P>
<P>
The two-day EU Summit omitted much of a statement from the
final communique of the Cologne meeting though the statement was
hoped to allay fears over recent slides of the single currency.
</P>
<P>
The initial draft had failed to brake the five-month-old
currency from declining and economists warned that the planned EU
statement could open the door for further drops on the forex
market.
</P>
<P>
The euro dropped to a new low of 1.0275 U.S. dollars on Friday,
or more than 12 percent lower than its original value.
</P>
<P>
The euro dropped to 1.0303 dollars early on Thursday in the
Tokyo foreign exchange market despite remarks by the ECB governor
a day earlier. The New York exchange market closed at 1.0345
dollars on Wednesday for an earlier record decline.
</P>
<P>
Analysts have often complained about differing comments from
European leaders about the single currency.
</P>
<P>
Finance ministers, who were also participating the Cologne
summit, said they would address the problem through tighter self-
discipline.

BEIJING, June 4 (Xinhua) -- "Development is an absolute
necessity," Chinese President Jiang Zemin told Kim Yong Nam,
president of the Presidium of the Supreme People's Assembly of the
Democratic People's Republic of Korea (DPRK), in a meeting here
this afternoon.
</P>
<P>
Since last year, Jiang said, China has had to deal with the
impact of natural disasters and financial turmoil and has
withstood the effects of power politics. All this shows the truth
of this statement.
</P>
<P>
According to the president, there are three major symbols of a
nation's strength: economic power, the national ability to protect
itself, and national coherence, which means the solidarity of all
its people.
</P>
<P>
Only when a nation is powerful, he concluded, can it remain
invincible.

<TEXT>
<P>
ATHENS, June 4 (Xinhua) -- Greece has undertaken a new
mediation effort aimed at clarifying certain aspects of the Kosovo
peace deal, the Greek news media reported Friday.
</P>
<P>
Greek Foreign Minister George Papandreou, who is in Cologne,
Germany, for the two-day European Union (EU) summit, had
discussions via the telephone Thursday night with NATO Secretary
General Javier Solana, Yugoslav Foreign Minister Zivadin Jovanovic,
U.S. Secretary of State Madeleine Albright and Assistant Secretary
of State Strobe Talbot, the semi-official Athens News Agency (ANA)
quoted diplomatic sources as saying Friday.
</P>
<P>
The sources said that Papandreou's mediation would focus on
ways of implementing the withdrawal of Serb forces from Kosovo in
tandem with the suspension of NATO's bombing of Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
He said that once Serb forces have begun withdrawing from
Kosovo, Solana will most probably order an end to the alliance's
bombing campaign.
</P>
<P>
Kranidiotis hoped that peace efforts would proceed rapidly.

MANILA, June 4 (Xinhua) -- The Central Bank of the Philippines
has cut by another 25 basis points its key overnight rates
following the decline in inflation in May, sources of the bank
said Friday.
</P>
<P>
Thus, the overnight borrowing rate will move down next Monday
to 9.625 percent from 9.875 percent and its overnight lending rate
to 11.625 percent from 11.875 percent.
</P>
<P>
The is the 16th time for the bank to cut the borrowing and
lending rates this year, bringing the cumulative drop since the
start of the year to 375 basis points from 13.375 percent and
15.375 percent respectively.
</P>
<P>
The sources said that a favorable operating market environment,
a sustained downtrend in the 91-day treasury bill rate, a stable
peso and a substantial inflation rate drop in May allowed the
further easing of monetary policy.
</P>
<P>
The May inflation rate fell to 6.7 percent from the revised
April inflation rate of 7.9 percent.
</P>
<P>
The bank's governor Gabriel Singson was quoted as saying that
the inflation decline is the fourth consecutive drop and is
significantly below the target of 8.1 percent for May this year.
</P>
<P>
He assured that the central bank would continue to maintain a
cautious yet flexible stance in monetary management to avoid
upward pressure on inflation.
</P>
<P>
He added that the bank would continue with its efforts to bring
down relevant components of banks' intermediation cost to help
reduce the general level of lending rates.
</P>
<P>
The thrust, he said, is to encourage more credit growth to
stimulate greater investment and output which would plug the
remaining weakness on the supply side.

<HEADLINE> French Patient Leaves Hospital After Recovery </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, June 4 (Xinhua) -- Jean Escalon, a French tourist who
had a sudden bout of a serious disease in China's Qinghai Province
and had to be moved to Beijing on a Chinese air force plane, was
able to leave the clinic after a lucky recovery.
</P>
<P>
The 63-year-old Escalon was hit by a sudden outbreak of renal
colic on May 31 in the city of Golmud in western Qinghai, where
the local hospital was unable to properly help him.
</P>
<P>
The Beijing Office of Singapore's AEA (Asia Emergency
Assistance) International was contacted and they sought help from
the Chinese People's Liberation Army, which immediately sent a
special plane to bring him to Beijing on the evening of June 2.
</P>
<P>
After 36 hours in hospital his condition was better and he is
quite well, according to John Williams, chief representative of
the AEA Beijing Office.
</P>
<P>
According to Dr. Peter Guerin of the AEA clinic, tests
confirmed the initial diagnosis by the Golmud hospital that the
renal colic was caused by kidney stones. But, they didn't find any
stones in the patient's kidney or bladder, so fortunately they
must have passed out of his body with the urine. In more serious
cases, a person may need surgery.
</P>
<P>
Escalon had planned to bicycle to Lhasa, capital of southwest
China's Tibet Autonomous Region. So, to give the ambitious man
some consolation, officials at China's National Tourism
Administration presented him with a special gift, a photo album of
Tibetan scenery, and invited him to visit China again.

<P>
MANILA, June 4 (Xinhua) -- The Philippine government Friday
expressed confidence that the Philippine Airlines (PAL) can
continue flying with the removal of the financial baggage.
</P>
<P>
National Security Adviser Alexander Aguirre said the 200
million U.S. dollars in fresh capital required under the flag
carrier's rehabilitation program has already been deposited with
the Allied Bank under the PAL's name.
</P>
<P>
With the infusion of fresh capital by PAL Chairman Lucio Tan,
Aguirre said, "There will be no disruption of the PAL schedules."
</P>
<P>
Vice President Gloria Arroyo, for her part, said there appears
to be no more major issue weighing down the PAL's operation as the
airline's rehabilitation program would automatically proceed.
</P>
<P>
"The rehabilitation plan is approved. So therefore they can
proceed with the rehabilitation of PAL," she said.
</P>
<P>
Last Thursday, President Joseph Estrada said Tan assured him
that he had already raised the 200 million U.S. dollars in fresh
capital before the June 4 deadline set by the Securities and
Exchange Commission (SEC).
</P>
<P>
SEC Chairman Perfecto Yasay told the Office of the President
Executive Committee Friday morning that Tan had delivered on his
financial commitment.

<HEADLINE> No Decision Yet on Russian Peacekeepers in Kosovo </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, June 4 (Xinhua) -- Russian Defense Minister Igor
Sergeyev said here Friday that no decision has been made
concerning Russia's involvement in a peacekeeping force in
Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
Following a meeting with President Boris Yeltsin, Sergeyev said
Yeltsin would have the final say on the matter.
</P>
<P>
"The General Staff and the Defense Ministry's International
Defense Cooperation Board have been working round the clock" to
plan generally acceptable options for the implementation of the
understandings already reached, Sergeyev said.
</P>
<P>
The results of the latest talks require much planning to be
done, in particular as regards a peacekeeping force, he said.
</P>
<P>
"Various suggestions were made" by members of the Russian
negotiating team "about ways to implement the president's
directives," Sergeyev said. "There were arguments and discussions,
but the fact that the Yugoslav parliament has approved it suggests
that the document was politically successful," he said.
</P>
<P>
The defense minister's remarks seemed to confirm media reports
of disagreements between Chernomyrdin and the military members of
the Russian delegation.
</P>
<P>
Both Chernomyrdin and Leonid Ivashov, a general in charge of
the Russian military's foreign contacts, on Thursday denied the
existence of such disagreements.
</P>
<P>
However, Ivashov said Friday that the peace plan for Yugoslavia
contains a number of provisions that threaten the sovereignty of
the Balkan country.
</P>
<P>
He said in Minsk, the capital of Belarus, that the rapid
withdrawal of all Yugoslav military and police forces from Kosovo
could result "in a power vacuum in Kosovo that might be filled by
the Kosovo Liberation Army, threatening the lives of the 250,000
Serbs there."
</P>
<P>
In such a case, developments could take a tragic turn, he said.
</P>
<P>
According to Ivashov, the peace plan makes Russia dependent "on
the good or ill will of NATO," the Interfax news agency reported.
</P>
<P>
The Yugoslav General Staff will have to conclude an agreement
with NATO under which the alliance will decide whether Russia is
to be involved in Kosovo or not, Ivashov said.
</P>
<P>
Ivashov also pointed out dangers in the legal sphere. Even
though the plan declares the territorial integrity of Yugoslavia
and that Kosovo remains part of Yugoslavia, reality will depend on
NATO actions, he said.
</P>
<P>
Asked whether the peace plan betrays the interests of
Yugoslavia and Russia, Ivashov said: "Everyone should decide that
with his own heart."
</P>
<P>
In a related development, Yeltsin, in a telephone conversation
with German Chancellor Gerhard Schroeder on Friday, said "there is
no reason for a continuation of the NATO aggression against
Yugoslavia."

<HEADLINE> EU Summit Alters Euro Statement </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
COLOGNE, June 4 (Xinhua) -- Leaders of the 15 European Union (
EU) member states at the bloc's summit here altered on Friday its
planned statement concerning the weakening single currency, the
euro, after two days of meetings.
</P>
<P>
The EU state or government heads removed much from a draft
statement on the euro from a communique that had been intended to
allay fears on the foreign exchange market over the currency's
slide.
</P>
<P>
Sources close to the summit said the final text of the
communique would include a general comment saying that a stable
euro would increase Europe's ability to promote growth and
employment.
</P>
<P>
The initial draft had failed to brake the five-month-old
currency from declining while economists warned that the planned
EU statement could open doors for further drops on the market.
</P>
<P>
The euro dropped to a new low of 1.0275 U.S. dollars on Friday,
or more than 12 percent lower than its original value at its
inauguration in January.
</P>
<P>
The euro dropped to 1.0303 dollars early on Thursday in the
Tokyo foreign exchange market despite the remarks by European
Central Bank governor Wim Duisenberg a day earlier. The New York
exchange market closed at 1.0345 dollars on Wednesday for an
earlier record decline.
</P>
<P>
Analysts complained about the differing comments from different
European leaders about the single currency. Finance ministers,
who were also participating in the Cologne summit, said they would
address the problem.
</P>
<P>
The EU summit ended on Friday without an agreement on extending
the duty-free sales within the 15-nation bloc, though Germany,
France and Britain had sought to win a last-minute change.
</P>
<P>
The European Union has decided to end duty-free sales within
the union's single market by June 30. The decision to do so was
taken more than seven years ago.

<HEADLINE> Pyongyang Slams War Crimes Charges Against Yugoslav Leaders </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PYONGYANG, June 4 (Xinhua) -- The Democratic People's Republic
of Korea (DPRK) Friday accused the U.N. War Crimes Tribunal of
trampling international law and interferring in the internal
affairs of Yugoslavia with its indictment of Yugoslav leaders on
alleged "war crimes."
</P>
<P>
Answering a question from the Korean Central News Agency, a
DPRK Foreign Ministry spokesman said the indictment represented
another serious ravage of justice and international law, and an
outrageous interference in the internal affairs of a sovereign
state.
</P>
<P>
He said the U.S.-led NATO, which had committed most inhuman war
crimes in Yugoslavia, should instead be brought to justice.
</P>
<P>
Undoubtedly, the spokesman said, the indictment was the product
of a sinister conspiracy plotted by the United States. The fact
that it emerged at a time when the international community was
engaged in active diplomatic efforts to settle the Kosovo crisis
demonstrated that the United States had no intention of seeking a
peaceful solution.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. would stoop to nothing to achieve its goal of
overriding the Balkans region and dominating the world, added the
spokesman.
</P>
<P>
He noted that the DPRK would, together with all progressive
people in the world who stood for a peaceful settlement of the
Kosovo issue, continue to support the Yugoslav people in their
fight to safeguard their dignity and sovereignty.

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, June 4 (Xinhua) -- Li Peng, chairman of the Standing
Committee of the Chinese National People's Congress (NPC), today
asked developing countries to make joint efforts to establish a
just and rational new political and economic order in the world.
</P>
<P>
In a meeting today with Abdullah Ben Hussain Al-Ahmar, speaker
of the House of Representatives of Yemen, Li said developing
countries need a sound international environment for development,
and China's growth over the past several decades has shown how
important it is to properly handle the relationship between
reforms, development and stability.
</P>
<P>
Developing countries have a wide range of common interests in
opposing hegemonism and guarding national sovereignty, Li said,
and asked them to be on alert against the so-called theory of "
human rights being heavier than sovereignty".
</P>
<P>
Li praised Sino-Yemeni relations and said that bilateral ties
have made continuous progress and that there have been frequent
contacts between the two parliaments in the 40 years since
diplomatic ties were established.
</P>
<P>
He also talked about China's political and economic system and
the function of the NPC and said he hopes that the friendly
relations between the NPC and the Yemeni House of Representatives
will be reinforced.

Republic of China and the Chinese people will have great

</P>
<P>
On December 20, Macao will be returned to the motherland, he
said, expressing the conviction that, with the policies of "one
country, two systems", "Macao people governing Macao" and the high
degree of autonomy, Macao will, like Hong Kong, maintain its long-
term prosperity and stability.
</P>
<P>
Al-Ahmar said the purpose of his visit is to improve bilateral
relations, especially friendly contacts between the two
parliaments.
</P>
<P>
He also said that he wants to know more about China's
successful experience in its reforms, opening up, and economic
construction. He said he believes that China's maintaining its own
cultural tradition and values while carrying out the reforms are
commendable.
</P>
<P>
He said that Yemen respects China's position of upholding
justice and of not being afraid of stronger powers and appreciates
China's stance of settling conflicts peacefully.
</P>
<P>
Hegemonism is harmful to world peace and development, he said,
emphasizing that the world should be a multi-polar one that is not
dominated by one force.
</P>
<P>
He invited Li to visit Yemen on behalf of the Yemeni House of
Representatives, and Li accepted it with pleasure.

BEIJING, June 4 (Xinhua) -- Chinese Premier Zhu Rongji, in a
telephone conference with German Chancellor Gerhard Schroeder
today, demanded NATO immediately stop the bombing of Yugoslavia so
as to provide the necessary conditions and atmosphere for the
United Nations Security Council to solve the Kosovo issue.
</P>
<P>
Zhu restated China's stand, saying that the Kosovo issue should
be peacefully solved through political dialogue under a principle
of respect for Yugoslavia's sovereignty and territorial integrity
and ensuring the rights and interests of all ethnic groups in the
Kosovo region.
</P>
<P>
An immediate halt in the bombing, he said, would not only help
all ethnic groups in Yugoslavia get away from the suffering of war,
but would also be beneficial to the stability and development in
the world, especially in the Balkans and the rest of Europe.
</P>
<P>
Schroeder thanked Zhu for the discussion and said that he will
soon send German foreign ministry officials to Beijing to inform
the Chinese about the details of developments there.
</P>
<P>
Zhu said that NATO should immediately halt the bombing even
before the U.N. Security Council discusses the Kosovo issue,
because it is very important to peace in the region and the rest
of the world.

He also expressed his hope that Schroeder would make efforts in

<HEADLINE> Drinking Water For Villagers Thanks to World Bank </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, June 4 (Xinhua) -- The World Bank has approved a loan
of 16 million U.S. dollars and a 30 million U.S. dollars
equivalent IDA credit to finance a clean drinking water project in
poor Chinese villages, according to the Bank's resident mission in
China.
</P>
<P>
As a result over three million poor Chinese villagers in China
will enjoy the benefits of clean, safe drinking water and improved
sanitation and health conditions.
</P>
<P>
The Fourth Rural Supply and Sanitation Project is part of a
series of World Bank water and sanitation projects which aim to
complement China's efforts in improving rural water supply and
sanitation. This project provides financing to the four provinces
of Anhui, Fujian, Guizhou and Hainan.
</P>
<P>
These provinces were selected because of their ability to
assist villagers in upgrading and maintaining their water supplies
once the project is implemented. Within each of the over 1,600
beneficiary villages, all residents will gain access to safe water.
</P>
<P>
China has recently made substantial progress in addressing
sanitation issues. The World Bank's first project in the series
supported only water supply, while the second project integrated
the water supply, sanitation and health education. The third and
fourth projects have continued to give attention to all three
elements, while stressing effective health education.
</P>
<P>
The World Bank loan has a maturity of 20 years, including a
five-year grace period, while the IDA credit has a maturity of 35
years.

<HEADLINE> Shanghai's Water Saving Effective </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHANGHAI, June 4 (Xinhua) -- China's largest industrial city of
Shanghai has been effective in its water management, saving one
billion cubic meters of water over the last five years.
</P>
<P>
 The eastern coastal city is rich in water resources, but
drinkable water accounts for only about 20 percent of the surface-
water resources.
</P>
<P>
 In China, Shanghai has been listed as one of the 36 cities
with a water shortage. The United Nations has predicted that it
will become one of the world's six largest cities with acute water
problems.
</P>
<P>
 To better utilize the existing water, Shanghai began planning
water management in the 1980s. Over the past several years, it
passed a series of water related regulations and imposed quotas on
industries such as bicycle and paper making, printing and dyeing.
</P>
<P>
 So far, all of the city's 16,500 heavy water users have
adopted planned utilization of water. And the industrial water re-
use rate has climbed to 77.8 percent from 71 percent in 1991.

<HEADLINE> Iranian Leader Vows to Continue Khomeini's Path </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, June 4 (Xinhua) -- Iran's paramount leader Ayatollah
Ali Khamenei Friday pledged to continue the path of late Iranian
supreme leader Ayatollah Musavi Khomeini and brushed aside the
recent debate over freedom in the country.
</P>
<P>
The path of Imam Khomeini was the path for the salvation of
this country from the beginning of the Islamic revolution in 1979
and later during his lifetime and even today, Khamenei said to a
crowd gathered inside and around Khomeini's mausoleum to mark the
10th anniversary of Khomeini's death.
</P>
<P>
"After the Imam's (Khomeini) demise, we announced that we will
continue his line and path. this was not a move out of imitation,
but rather based on experience and knowledge," he said.
</P>
<P>
Khamenei stated that freedom was a cornerstone of the Islamic
movement and "what is said about freedom today is in fact an
important part of the movement initiated by Imam Khomeini."
</P>
<P>
"A group of parvenus want to teach the Imam (Khomeini) and the
Islamic system how to practice freedom of thought and
expression," he said, but "the Imam and his followers don't need
to be taught by others about freedom."
</P>
<P>
Khamenei's remarks came after a group of moderate factions and
print media supporting moderate President Mohammad Khatami called
for practice of freedom of expression in the country and condemned
any crackdown on freedom.
</P>
<P>
The Iranian leader cited Islam, social justice and "not to be
deceived by enemies" as the three main points of Khomeini's line.
</P>
<P>
Islam is the most important feature of Khomeini's line because
he did not regard anything to be above Islam in the world and his
revolution and movement was for the sake of sovereignty of Islam,
he said.
</P>
<P>
Another characteristic of Khomeini's line is social justice
and assistance to the oppressed, deprived and bare-footed strata
in the society, Khamenei said. Social justice is among the main
slogans of the Islamic revolution, he added.
</P>
<P>
However, he admitted that social justice has not been fully
materialized, but great attempts are being made by the Iranian
officials to accomplish this goal.
</P>
<P>
"Today the servant government has focused its attention on
rendering assistance to the deprived regions and we owe this to
social justice," the Iranian leader said.
</P>
<P>
Another feature of Khomeini's line is "not to be deceived by
the enemies," Khamenei said. "How can the Islamic system which has
put an end to the interests of the arrogant powers, be without
enemies?" he said.
</P>
<P>
He said that Iran was a constant target of enemy propaganda as
well as other conspiracies such as the economic sanctions. "What
is unacceptable for the U.S. and other arrogant powers is the
independence and vigilance of the Iranian nation for rejecting
their policies," he said.

<P>
BEIRUT, June 4 (Xinhua) -- Lebanese Prime Minister Salim Hoss
Friday inspected Jezzine, a day after the pro-Israeli South
Lebanon Army (SLA) militia completed its withdrawal from the
Christian enclave.
</P>
<P>
Hoss chaired a meeting in Jezzine's municipal building
attended by security and economic officials, and local dignitaries
to discuss the reconstruction plan of Jezzine, which has been held
by the militia since 1985.
</P>
<P>
Hoss, the first prime minister to inspect Jezzine in 17 years,
extended congratulations to local residents, saying they have been
liberated from the occupation.
</P>
<P>
He instructed government departments concerned to listen to
the demands and needs of local people, saying the state will
begin to serve them.
</P>
<P>
The militia completed a three-day withdrawal from Jezzine
early Thursday and has redeployed inside the adjacent
Israeli-occupied security zone.
</P>
<P>
Israel set up the self-declared zone in south Lebanon in 1985
with the claimed aim of protecting its north from cross-border
attacks by Lebanese guerrillas.
</P>
<P>
The Iranian-backed Hezbollah, or Party of God, is leading a
war of attrition to oust Israeli occupation forces and their
allied SLA out of the country.
</P>
<P>
The 2,500-member SLA was trained and financed by Israel to help
patrol the security zone.
</P>
<P>
The pullout came after the SLA was subjected to a series of
severe attacks by Hezbollah, which killed more than 150 SLA
members, including two commanders of the Jezzine garrison, and
wounded 400 others in the past 14 years.

<P>
MANILA, June 4 (Xinhua) -- The Philippines has finally
completed the fourth review of its economic program with the
International Monetary Fund (IMF), paving the way for the approval
by the IMF of the program and the release of further IMF fund,
sources of the Central Bank said Friday.
</P>
<P>
The fourth program review was completed following a second
visit by a mission of the IMF from May 26 to 31, the sources said.
</P>
<P>
The agreement reached between the two panels included
maintaining the Philippine government's budget deficit of 68.4
billion pesos (1.71 billion U.S. dollars) which is equivalent to
2.2 percent of the gross national product (GNP).
</P>
<P>
In a joint statement, the two sides agreed that targets in the
program continue to represent an appropriate balance between the
need for fiscal stimulus in support of the recovery, and the
importance of consolidating the significant gains.
</P>
<P>
The Philippine penal also presented an outline of fiscal
targets for the year 2000, which the IMF mission endorsed, the
sources said.
</P>
<P>
It was agreed by both panels that with the recovery expected to
gather momentum this year, the objective is to reduce the fiscal
deficit by about one percent of GNP next year, they said.
</P>
<P>
Within the agreed framework, the two panels share the view that
enhancing revenue collection, especially on domestic taxes, is a
priority task in support of the budget goals for this year and the
medium-term.
</P>
<P>
The IMF review mission was a follow-up visit to the April
discussions which were not completed due to some of the country's
fiscal problems.

<TEXT>
<P>
COLOGNE, June 4 (Xinhua) -- Russian President Boris Yeltsin and
German Chancellor Gerhard Schroeder agreed on Friday that the 70-
odd-day NATO airstrikes against Yugoslavia must end now that the
Balkan nation has accepted the Group of Eight peace plan.
</P>
<P>
Yeltsin, according to reports reaching here, talked with
Schroeder over telephone and they agreed that airstrikes should
now cease and that a United Nations Security Council resolution to
that effect should be adopted.
</P>
<P>
Belgrade's acceptance of the peace plan, worked out earlier
last month by the Group of Eight in Bonn, meant that there was "no
ground for a continuation of NATO aggression against Yugoslavia,"
reports quoted the Russian president as saying.

<P>
The two leaders also discussed over the phone plans for another
meeting between them. Schroeder is participating in the current
two-day European Union Summit in Cologne.

The summit discussed the issue of Kosovo and heard a report by

his trip to Belgrade on Thursday, approved a unionwide employment
pact and decided to call a special conference over the Balkans
stability pact later this month.

<HEADLINE> ITU Adopts Common Image Format for TV Programs </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GENEVA, June 4 (Xinhua) -- The International Telecommunication
Union (ITU) has adopted a new electronic production standard for
TV programs.
</P>
<P>
"For the first time, a worldwide production format --
essentially without any necessary regional variations -- is
available that could well revolutionize the film and television
industries," said the union on announcing the decision taken here
on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The ITU had already agreed on formats for high definition
television program production in 1997, but the new agreement adds
considerably to this family.
</P>
<P>
The new common image format consists of 1,080 by 1,920 picture
elements, progressive scanning, a picture height to width ratio of
16:9 as well as the same picture-taking rate used for motion
pictures.
</P>
<P>
The ITU says that the format will be usable for crystal sharp
productions both for television broadcast and on cinema screens,
without time-consuming, quality-degrading and expensive
conversions.
</P>
<P>
Until now, electronic high definition production only allowed a
different picture-taking rate, which was 50 or 60 pictures per-
second for TV production, as opposed to 24 for motion picture
production on celluloid.
</P>
<P>
Yet, many prime time programs shown on TV are in fact shot on
35mm or 16mm film and converted to pictures on the screen by a
process called "pull down." In a world of convergence, where
budgets for production are put under great strain and quality
matters, it made little business sense to continue this dual-track
process.
</P>
<P>
Film already shot on celluloid can be converted to this
electronic equivalent and broadcast with ease.
</P>
<P>
What is more, with the new equipment, a film director will also
be able to directly shoot electronically, and instantly preview
the shot for quality without the lengthy examination of rushes.
If the shot needs to be retaken, it will be possible to do it
immediately and cut down on the overall production time with big
net savings.

<HEADLINE> Indonesia's Election Campaign Ends Calmly </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, June 4 (Xinhua) -- The 17-day election campaign in
Indonesia ended calmly Friday with no meaningful incidents, Chief
of the General Election Commission (KPU) Rudini said.
</P>
<P>
Rudini made the remark at a press conference at the KPU media
center shortly after his meeting with President B.J. Habibie to
KPU's report on the final preparation for the general election
next Monday (June 7).
</P>
<P>
He said the three-week-long campaign only claimed 19 lives,
less than that in the 1997 election campaign when 329 people were
killed. This gave a more positive atmosphere to the upcoming
polling day, he added.
</P>
<P>
President Habibie has well accepted the KPU's report and
praised for the general election preparation, he said.
</P>
<P>
"President Habibie was satisfied with the update and called for
a cum Laude degree for me as facilitator for the election," said
Rudini.
</P>
<P>
According to the KPU chief, the polling process will be
supported by a US/400 mainframe system to enable faster ballot
counting and wider range of control by the people for the results
will be able to be accessed through an interactive phone, fax, and
Internet system established.
</P>
<P>
Although, he said, in general the preparation for the polling
day is due to completion, the election in Aceh province, where
unrest has taken place in several districts recently, is still
under deep consideration and the exact time and date will be
decided at the last day before the polling day.
</P>
<P>
Armed Forces Commander Gen. Wiranto said earlier that voting in
some areas in Aceh could be delayed because of security concerns.
However, he said, elections will take place on June 7 for the
whole of Indonesia.
</P>
<P>
Rudini announced that the campaign closed officially at 18:00
local time (1100 GMT) and from 00:01 June 5 all campaign
advertisement through electronic and printed media will be
prohibited, and all political parties must then clean the entire
nation from campaign attributes such as posters, banners, etc.
</P>
<P>
He said most of the Indonesians hope for a smooth, safe, honest
and fair election to be contested by 48 political parties, the
first multi-party election in 30 years.
</P>
<P>
The country's 128 million eligible voters will elect 462
candidates to the 500-seat House of Representatives (parliament)
in the forthcoming election. The remaining 38 seats will be
reserved for the Armed Forces whose members do not vote.

<HEADLINE> Roundup: Good Start for Successful Polls in Indonesia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, June 4 (Xinhua) -- A three-week-long election
campaign in Indonesia drew to a close Friday in a peaceful
atmosphere, laying a solid foundation for the success of the
general election to be held next Monday.
</P>
<P>
From May 19 to June 4, almost all the 48 political parties
contesting the 1999 general elections conducted campaigns in
various forms. Their activities began with a show of strength as
the parties held mass rallies and demonstrations in big cities,
established command posts, put up party signs and posters and
displayed banners and flags in various strategic places in the
capital city and in the regions.
</P>
<P>
Describing the polls as a festival of democracy, the contenders
also campaigned through public gatherings, meetings and art
performances and through national television and radio broadcasts.
The four biggest parties -- the Indonesian Democratic Party of
Struggle (PDI-P), the United Development Party (PPP), the National
Mandate Party (PAN) and the National Awaking Party (PKB) dominated
the campaigning activities in the last 17 days.
</P>
<P>
"The campaign has been conducted with joy and in a peaceful
manner." This was the comment generally made by Indonesians and
foreign diplomats when they were asked for their impressions.
</P>
<P>
Most of the people showed great interest, enthusiasm and
pleasure in participating in the campaign, although many parties
violated traffic regulations and several clashes took place in
some areas.
</P>
<P>
According to officials of the General Election Commission,
more than 170 people were killed during the campaign activities,
but only 16 people died of clashes between rival parties as others
were killed in traffic accidents. In comparison, about 400 people
were killed in the 1997 election campaign.
</P>
<P>
Armed Forces Commander General Wiranto described the present
national security situation as conducive to the planned general
elections on June 7. The security forces are ready to support the
implementation of the election, he stressed.
</P>
<P>
On the reasons behind the better campaign this year, officials
said most political parties and common people have realized that
this year's general election is of strategic importance for
Indonesia's efforts to establish a new and credible government,
which is expected to pull the nation out of the prolonged economic
crisis and social turbulence.
</P>
<P>
Another reason was that an 800,000-member security force has
been deployed in important places throughout the country with the
support of security personnel from some major parties.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the institutes in charge of elections have also made
a series of laws to ensure a free and fair election in a bid to
win the confidence of both the people in the country and the
international community. The General Election Commission also
agreed to let 61 domestic election monitoring organizations and 13
international monitoring organizations supervise the process of
campaign and the forthcoming election.
</P>
<P>
This year's election campaign was different from those of the
past because 48 parties participated, compared with only three in
the last 30 years, when the campaign was always dominated by the
ruling Golkar.
</P>
<P>
The Golkar, which won six general elections in the past 30
years, is facing fierce challenge from some newly established
reformist parties, most of which called on the people to support
the reformist forces and oppose the "status quo" headed by the
Golkar.
</P>
<P>
Almost all the parties indicated that a new and clean
government resulting from the general election is the key to
Indonesia's economic recovery.
</P>
<P>
General Election Commission officials confirmed that
preparations are completed for the June 7 election, the first
multi-party election in 30 years. They believe that the election
would be an honest, fair and best one in the country's history.
</P>
<P>
The 128 million eligible voters in the country with a
population of 202 million will elect 462 members to the 500-seat
House of Representatives (parliament), with the remaining 38 seats
reserved for the Armed Forces, which do not vote.

PARIS, June 4 (Xinhua) -- The following are major news items in
leading French newspapers on Friday:
</P>
<P>
Liberation:
</P>
<P>
-- In a Serbia reduced to ruins by 71 days of bombings,
Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic finally has accepted the
peace plan for Kosovo. The Westerners are waiting for "a visible
withdrawal" of Serb forces from Kosovo to arrange an ending to the
air campaign.
</P>
<P>
-- In the second free and multiracial legislative election held
in South Africa on Wednesday, the party of President Nelson
Mandela won 66 percent of the votes. Thabo Mbeki, the future
president, is a brilliant man admired by many South Africans.
</P>
<P>
Le Figaro:
</P>
<P>
-- The primary hope for peace in Kosovo appeared on Thursday
after Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic and the Serbian
Parliament accepted the plan of the Group of Eight countries. But
prudence dominates the Western allies, which are waiting for a
gesture from Milosevic while continuing the bombings.
</P>
<P>
-- The crisis over the contamination of pig and chicken food by
toxic dioxin material has spread to beef in Belgium. It is found
that the same animal food feeding chickens sold by a Belgian
company has been used to feed more cattle than pigs and chickens.

<HEADLINE> Thai Economy Bottoms Out: Central Bank </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, June 4 (Xinhua) -- Economic figures indicated that the
Thai economy has already bottomed out and is heading for the
growth path, the Thai News Agency (TNA) quoted central bank
governor Chatumongkol Sonakul as saying Friday.
</P>
<P>
The governor said the Thai economy is now improving, with the
overall industrial capacity last month increasing to 57 percent,
compared with 51 percent in January.
</P>
<P>
The Index of Industrial Output also rose to 107 points last
month from 100 points earlier this year, he said.
</P>
<P>
Inflation this year is expected to be at a low level, ranging
from 0.5 percent to 0.7 percent while the economic growth is
projected to be 1 percent as targeted.
</P>
<P>
"These make the country's GDP (gross domestic product) become
positive now, reflecting that the Thai economy has bottomed out
and is upturning to the growth trend," he was quoted as saying.
</P>
<P>
However, Finance Minister Tarrin Nimmanhaeminda warned the
government and the public earlier this week not to become
complacent although good signs have emerged in the economy.
</P>
<P>
More reforms and restructuring would be carried out and the
government should also prevent deflation, caused by low interest
rates and low inflation, which might lead to corporate losses and
laying off workers, he said.

JOHANNESBURG, June 4 (Xinhua) -- South Africa's African
National Congress (ANC) was still marginally short of winning a
two-thirds majority late Friday morning when more than 15 million
votes had been counted at the results center in Pretoria.
</P>
<P>
Some 18.17 million people registered to vote but the number of
people who had actually voted is still not clear.
</P>
<P>
A fresh batch of election results was released at 11.30 a.m.
(0930 GMT) Friday, showing the ANC had won 65.73 percent of the
votes counted.
</P>
<P>
The Democratic Party had consolidated its position as the main
contender for the official opposition, with 10.09 percent --
pulling ahead of its main rival, the Inkatha Freedom Party, which
got 8.02 percent.
</P>
<P>
The New National Party, which was the official opposition
before the elections, was trailing with 7.48 percent, followed by
the United Democratic Movement with 3.34 percent. The African
Christian Democratic Party had 1.48 percent.
</P>
<P>
The results center's computers had yet to update with the fresh
batch of figures, which were posted on the center's electronic
scoreboard. This made it difficult to immediately analyze the
figures.
</P>
<P>
The figures have yet to be verified, and the percentage
breakdown could change considerably as more results come in.
</P>
<P>
About 933 of the 14,560 voting districts have yet to submit
their results.

JAKARTA, June 4 (Xinhua) -- The final campaign of Indonesia's
ruling Golkar Party was disrupted in some areas here Friday.

Security personnel opened fire on people near the Senen market

After the ruling Golkar Party and nine other minor parties
staged their final campaigns, the election campaign ended on
Friday. A two-day "cooling-off" period will precede the general
election on June 7.
</P>
<P>
Armed Forces Commander General Wiranto said Thursday that based
on data, analyses and reports from regional military and police
commanders, it may be concluded that the present national security
situation is quite conducive to the implementation of the polls.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Indonesian Police Chief Gen. Roesmanhadi has warned
the people to be vigilant of attempts to thwart Monday's general
election.
</P>
<P>
"There are indications that certain quarters want the general
election to fail," Roesmanhadi said after a get-together with the
chairmen of 27 political parties here on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
He hoped that with the people's increased awareness and
alertness, these provocateurs will fail.
</P>
<P>
Coordinating Minister for Political Affairs Feisal Tanjung
Friday also alerted the people to the presence of extremist groups
who wish to disrupt the election.
</P>
<P>
"There is a possibility of unrest and disturbance during the
election if people cannot control their emotions," he said.
</P>
<P>
He also called on all parties to be vigilant in facing possible
moves by provocateurs and extremist groups which do not want a
fair and successful election.

KUNMING, June 4 (Xinhua) -- Over 350 people gathered here today
to attend the fifteenth conference on economic coordination in
southwest China.
</P>
<P>
Present at the meeting was Yang Rudai, a vice-chairman of the
National Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative
Conference.
</P>
<P>
Leading government officials from Sichuan, Yunnan and Guizhou
provinces, Tibet and Guangxi autonomous regions, Chongqing
Municipality and Chengdu City, participated in the conference to
discuss ways for cooperation in key economic fields like
communications, telecommunications, tourism, environmental
protection, and science and education.
</P>
<P>
The first of the conferences was held in 1984 and since then,
the provinces, autonomous regions and cities have jointly
implemented over 9,500 development projects, involving a total

<HEADLINE> Australian Stocks Lower on Key Industrial Stocks </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, June 4 (Xinhua) -- The Australian sharemarket slipped
lower Friday, driven by losses across some key industrial stocks
as investors apparently disregarded a healthy rise on Wall Street.
</P>
<P>
Dealers said the local bourse lost ground after having probably
overdone its 26.9-point rise on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The benchmark all ordinaries index finished 12.3 points softer
at 2,929.3.
</P>
<P>
Overall, the industrial index shed 27.8 points to 5,167.4 while
the all resources firmed 2.6 points to 1,136.2.
</P>
<P>
Diversified resources heavyweight BHP rose 10 cents to 16.31
Australian dollars and global miner Rio Tinto eased 9.4 cents to
22.5 Australian dollars.
</P>
<P>
The gold sector was relatively quiet after a modest recovery in
gold bullion prices on Thursday night. The metal was 2.85 U.S.
dollars higher in Sydney at 266.5 U.S. dollars per fine ounce.
</P>
<P>
The banking index slid 38.8 points to 6,666.6 as the
Commonwealth Bank of Australia retreated 31 cents to 24.86
Australian dollars, National Australia Bank dropped 4.7 cents to
25.953 Australian dollars, ANZ bank shed 14.5 cents to 11.18
Australian dollars and Westpac bank closed 1.4 cents down to
10.276 Australian dollars after going ex-dividend.
</P>
<P>
National turnover reached 374.07 million shares worth 705
million Australian dollars with falls outpacing rises by 667 to

<HEADLINE> Australian Dollar Ends Higher </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, June 4 (Xinhua) -- The Australian dollar closed
stronger Friday, spurred on by a mild uptick in the price of gold
and strength in a leading commodities index.
</P>
<P>
ABN Amro currency strategist Peter Clay said the domestic unit
made its gains in trading on Thursday and stagnated for most of
the day, ending in Sydney at 64.98 U.S. cents from 64.17 U.S.
cents.
</P>
<P>
During the day it hit a high of 65.08 U.S. cents and touched a
low of 64.85 U.S. cents.
</P>
<P>
Clay said the main reason for the stronger Australian dollar
was a three-week high in the Commodity Research Bureau Index (CRB)
in New York on Thursday night.
</P>
<P>
The CRB closed up 1.54 points at 191.26.
</P>
<P>
The index includes 17 key U.S. commodity futures prices and
although having little relevance to Australia's main commodities,
traders follow it as an important indicator for the Australian
dollar.
</P>
<P>
A halt to the recent slide in the price of gold on Thursday
also propped up the local currency, he said.
</P>
<P>
At the close of local trading the Australian dollar was buying
0.6304 euro from 0.6208 euro and 79.08 Japanese yen from 78.18
yen.

<HEADLINE> China to Launch Giant Afforestation Project </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUNMING, June 4 (Xinhua) -- An ambitious afforestation project
will be launched in southwest China in the next 10 years in order
to protect the biological and environmental balance along the
Yangtze and Zhujiang rivers.
</P>
<P>
This was announced here today at a conference attended by
leaders of Sichuan, Yunnan and Guizhou provinces, Tibet and
Guangxi autonomous regions, Chongqing Municipality and Chengdu
City. Local leaders in the southwest meet every year to coordinate
their development efforts.
</P>
<P>
The afforestation project, which will cost 120 billion yuan and
cover 65.98 million, is aimed at increasing the green coverage in
the region to 47 percent by 2010, from the present 36.3 percent.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, local governments will invest another 37 billion
yuan to stop the logging of natural forests and turn cultivated
lands, on mountain sides with a slope of 25 degrees and above,
back into forests.
</P>
<P>
The Yangtze and Zhujiang river areas, with their lower reaches
boasting the most developed areas in China, account for one third
of the country's population and 40 percent of the national output
value.
</P>
<P>
Blind tree felling and farming have caused severe soil-erosion
in the region. Last year, the government issued a ban on logging
in the region after raging floods devastated many parts of the
country and brought about heavy casualties and financial losses.

flee to the Padaviya and Sinhapura areas, police sources here said
Friday.
</P>
<P>
The attack by rebels of the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam

Although artillery fire had fallen on security forces at the
Janakapura and Kokilai areas, no security personnel were injured,
the sources said.

More than 1,500 families who have been displaced due to the
LTTE attack are staying in a school in Sinhapura and they have
been given dry rations.
</P>
<P>
The LTTE rebels have been fighting a war for a separate
homeland for minority Tamils in the north and east of the country
since 1983. Tens of thousands of people have been killed in the
civil war.

<P>
ADDIS ABABA, June 4 (Xinhua) -- The Ethiopian Roads Authority
said it has built or rehabilitated roads of close to 4,000
kilometers valued at 160 million U.S. dollars during the last
eight years.
</P>
<P>
Debebe Gizaw, manager of the authority's information and

Debebe said even in the past one year, a total of 233 kms of
asphalt roads were either newly built or rehabilitated.

<TEXT>
<P>
HEFEI, Anhui, June 4 (Xinhua) -- Sichuan Fo Lan club claimed a
three-set victory over error-prone Chendu Army club in an all-
Chinese affair on Friday at the first AVC Cup Men's Club
Volleyball Tournament.
</P>
<P>
Two sets down, Chendu Army failed to display the characters
which they showed in their triumphes over Qatar Al-Rayyan club and
NEC Blue Rockets club of Japan in the first two rounds and bowed
to the reigning champions of the Chinese league 20-25, 20-25, 18-
25.
</P>
<P>
From the outset, both sides were deadlocked in a seesaw match
during the first 20 rallies, but Fo Lan pulled away from 10-all as
spiker Zhang Xiang began to show his killer instinct before the
first set was settled 25-20 in favor of Sichuan.
</P>
<P>
Chendu tried to fight back into the game and kept on the heels
of Fo Lan early in the second set but their faults in attack and
slim defence cost them dearly as Fo Lan spiked their way to take
another set.
</P>
<P>
The worst moment came when Yang Liqun, the 37-year-old setter,
was sidelined for injuries recurrence, putting a three-setter loss
more in sight.
</P>
<P>
Chendu should thank Yu De while scolding him for it was the
spiker who ended the losing slid from time to time but it was also
him who made errors to plunge the club to their first defeat since
the men's club tournament opened on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Zhou Jian'an, head coach of Fo Lan, thought that the reason for
their victory is his side became more relaxed.
</P>
<P>
"I think we are more relaxed while they were all nerves. That
is why we could win the match," said the coach.
</P>
<P>
Zhou's views were echoed by his counterpart Yuan Chuan, who
said that his side became impatient and committed a string of
errors under the pressure of the attacking-minded Fo Lan.
</P>
<P>
Later Iran Paykan will meet Al-Rayyan of Qatar and the last
match of the day will pitch Samsung Fire &AMP; Marine Insurance club
against NEC Blue Rockets of Japan.

<HEADLINE> U.N. Operation Feeds 1.2 Million Drought Victims </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ADDIS ABABA, June 4 (Xinhua) -- The U.N. World Food Program
(WFP) announced Friday that the agency has approved a
40.5-million-U.S. dollars emergency operation to feed nearly 1.2
million people desperately in need of food in Ethiopia's eight
drought-stricken regions.
</P>
<P>
A news release issued by the WFP office here said farmers in
some areas of the country have been hurt by an extended fry spell
caused by the failure of the small rainy season that ended in May,
which hindered crop planting, germination and growth.
</P>
<P>
"Lower than expected crop yields after the main rainy season,
which ended in September, have compounded the problem," the press
release said, adding that "many farmers have been forced to sell
their oxen and other livestock because of the deteriorating food
situation."
</P>
<P>
WFP's emergency operation, running from June to December, will
provide some 103,253 tons of emergency food aid to the most
vulnerable sectors of the population, namely pregnant and nursing
mothers, children under five, the disabled and the elderly, the
press release said.
</P>
<P>
Parts of Ethiopia failed in this year's small rainy season from
February to May. The nation appealed this week for 360,000 tons
of food aid for an estimated 4.6 million people facing shortages
because of the failure of rains of small rainy season.

<P>
LONDON, June 4 (Xinhua) -- Manchester United's new goalkeeper
Mark Bosnich has been released on police bail in Birmingham after
being questioned on suspicion of robbery.
</P>
<P>
The former Aston Villa player, who just completed the biggest
move in his career by signing a four-year deal with the Manchester
United, was arrested after an alleged incident outside
Birmingham's Legs Eleven lap-dancing nightclub during his stag
night celebrations.
</P>
<P>
The Australian player, 27, is due to marry Sarah Jarret on
Friday afternoon.
</P>
<P>
According to loca reports on Friday, Bosnich was arrested at
his home in Little Aston, Staffordshire, early on Friday morning.
</P>
<P>
A West Midlands Police spokeswoman said: "Officers were called
to an incident in Wrottesley Street in Birmingham City centre at 1.
48am in the early hours of Friday morning, where a man from the
Birmingham area alleged that he had been attacked and robbed."
</P>
<P>
"A 27-year-old man from Little Aston, Staffordshire was
arrested at seven a.m. on suspicion of robbery. He is currently
being interviewed by police at Sutton Coldfield Police Station."
</P>
<P>
The police would not give any official confirmation that the
man arrested was Bosnich. But sources close to the case confirmed
the Australian goalkeeper, who is still under contract to Aston
Villa, was being questioned.
</P>
<P>
It is thought the man who filed the complaint to police was an
agency photographer, Jamie Jones, who was working for a national
newspaper.
</P>
<P>
Bosnich's wedding and reception are due to take place at the
Coombe Abbey hotel, in Warwickshire, at 2pm on Friday.
</P>
<P>
Hotel manager John Oxley said he was hopeful that the ceremony

being called off.
</P>
<P>
"We're all set and we hope that it will be a very happy day,"
he said.

<HEADLINE> Liberian, Togolese Presidents to Meet on S. Leone </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, June 4 (Xinhua) -- Liberian President Charles Taylor is
expected to visit Lome, Togo Friday for talks with his Togolese
counterpart Gnassingbe Eyadema on the crisis in Sierra Leone, the
Daily Times reported Friday.
</P>
<P>
A government statement issued in Liberian capital Monrovia
quoted Taylor as saying that "we are heartened by the on-going
negotiations between the government of Sierra Leone and force of
the Revolutionary United Front (RUF) ."
</P>
<P>
Taylor noted that Liberia would bring "a strong presence at
those deliberations with a view to maintaining the cease fire, and
the harmonization of those unresolved issues that would culminate
in the peaceful resolution of the conflict."
</P>
<P>
Sierra Leone and the international community have repeatedly
accused Taylor and his government of supporting the rebel RUF.
</P>
<P>
The Liberian government has denied the accusations, but
admitted that some 3,000 Liberia's former fighters from its own
seven-year civil war are currently fighting in Sierra Leone "on
their own" as mercenaries.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the Sierra Leonean government and the rebels agreed
Wednesday that war prisoners held by the two sides should be freed
within days, Togolese Foreign Minister Joseph Koffigoh announced.
</P>
<P>
Togo which holds chairmanship of the Economic Community of West
African States (ECOWAS) is brokering the peace talks between the
Sierra Leonean government and the rebels which has entered the
second week.
</P>
<P>
The minister recalled that the freeing of prisoners from the
eight-year civil war in Sierra Leone was foreseen in the
cease-fire agreement which led to the peace talks being held in
Lome.
</P>
<P>
The agreement which came into effect on May 24 was signed on
May 18 by Sierra Leonean President Ahmed Tejan Kabbah and RUF
leader Foday Sankoh.
</P>
<P>
Koffigoh said he was confident that the peace talks could be
concluded with an agreement next Wednesday.

<HEADLINE> Regulations Banning Sex Determination Tests </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHENYANG, June 4 (Xinhua) -- The northeastern Chinese province
of Liaoning has issued regulations banning medical institutions
from illegally using ultrasonic scanning technology to help
pregnant women discover if they are expecting boys.
</P>
<P>
Any hospitals or medical institutions that conduct such sex
determination tests on pregnant women without proper reasons will
be harshly penalized and heavily fined.
</P>
<P>
The regulations were drafted in the wake of the abnormally high
ratio of newborn boys against girls in Liaoning in recent years,
which stood at 1:109 in 1998, compared to the national average of
1:106.
</P>
<P>
Most Chinese families prefer to have boys instead of girls,
because the traditional thinking goes that only men can extend the
family name and strain.
</P>
<P>
According to the regulations, sex determination tests can only
be conducted in designated health care institutions and then only
on special occasions. For example, the scanning technology may be
used when it becomes necessary to rule out occurrences of sex
related hereditary diseases in the unborn.

<HEADLINE> Eye Problems on the Rise: Survey </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHANGHAI, June 4 (Xinhua) -- As China becomes more urbanized
increased leisure time dominated by watching TV and surfing the
Internet is posing greater risks of shortsightedness and other
problems with eyesight, particularly among the younger generation.
</P>
<P>
This has been revealed from a survey carried out in Beijing,
Shanghai and Guangzhou to link in with National Health Eye Day
which falls this Sunday.
</P>
<P>
More than 70 percent of those polled people chose watching TV
and reading books as their major recreations, while staring at
computer screens occupied most of the spare time of many young
people, the survey revealed.
</P>
<P>
Today's Wenhui Daily carried the results which also indicate
that more than 30 percent of the polled, especially those under
the age of 35, complained about asthenopia, a strained condition
of the eyes usually associated with headache and dizziness.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the average age for being affected by
shortsightedness has dropped to 14.3 years from 14.7 years in
Shanghai, and to 14.8 years from 15.2 years in Beijing.
</P>
<P>
Ophthalmologists have warned that eye problems not only make
daily life inconvenient, but also are potential causes of more
serious eye diseases, such as pathological changes of the retina.
</P>
<P>
However, about 65 percent of those polled said they did not
care much about the condition of their eyes.

<HEADLINE> Russian Reconnaissance Ship Returns From Adriatic </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, June 4 (Xinhua) -- The Russian reconnaissance ship
Liman returned from the Adriatic Sea Friday at the conclusion of
its mission to collect data on NATO air strikes against Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
The information collected by the Liman should give additional
weight to Russian arguments in advocating its position at the
Kosovo peace talks, the Interfax news agency quoted Anatoli
Bartyshev, captain of the Black Sea Fleet ship, as saying.
</P>
<P>
Military experts said the Liman returned to Novorossiisk,
rather than the base in Sevastopol, a Ukrainian port from which it
sailed, because the large volumes of information have to be
processed and analyzed in Russia, Interfax reported.
</P>
<P>
Bartyshev refused to disclose any details of the ship's
operations in the region, but said that during the first days of
the air campaign, NATO personnel, especially its pilots, displayed
high morale. But as the conflict dragged on, the morale "did not
remain as high as NATO sources claimed."
</P>
<P>
The loss of the U.S. F-117A stealth fighter-bomber, which had
been considered invincible, dealt an especially heavy
psychological blow, Bartyshev said. Western press reports that
over forty combat aircraft had been lost in the operation further
worsened the situation, he added.

<P>
MANILA, June 4 (Xinhua) -- The Securities and Exchange
Commission (SEC) of the Philippines Friday announced the
completion of raising the 200 million U.S. dollars needed to keep
the Philippine Airlines (PAL) flying.
</P>
<P>
SEC Chair Perfecto Yasay told reporters at a press conference
that the amount was kept in bank and can be utilized by the
cash-strapped PAL for its operations in accordance with the
approved rehabilitation plan.
</P>
<P>
Earlier, business tycoon Lucio Tan already infused a total of
100 million dollars into the flag carrier.
</P>
<P>
At the same press briefing, Jaime Bautista, formerly chief
operations officer of the PAL and now chief financial officer of
the Tan Group of Companies, said another 100 million dollars,
which the PAL was waiting for, came from three companies.
</P>
<P>
Of this amount, 70 million dollars came from the Hong Kong
Investments Company while 30 million dollars was from two Filipino
firms on which he did not elaborate further.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Yasay expressed optimism that the problem hounding
the PAL can now be put to rest.
</P>
<P>
He expected the parties involved to fully support the
rehabilitation plan so that the PAL can efficiently resume its
normal operations.
</P>
<P>
"We are all here committed to making sure that our national
flag carrier will continue flying," he said.

<HEADLINE> China to Buy Movie Technology from US, Germany </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CHANGCHUN, June 4 (Xinhua) -- In a bid to boost its feeble film
industry Chinese movie makers are to purchase state of the art
technology from the United States and Germany, government sources
said.
</P>
<P>
It will include digital recording equipment, computer-aided
operational systems, and lighting and camera apparatus.
</P>
<P>
The equipment will be used by the Changchuan Film Studio, one
of the top three filmmakers in China, and will cost dozens of
million yuan (or several million U.S.dollars).
</P>
<P>
The number of Chinese film fans has dropped by one million in
recent years because many of the domestic made films were
unattractive -- in terms of both shooting techniques and
storylines.

In the meantime, foreign blockbusters like "Jurassic Park" and
"Saving Private Ryan" which use the best of modern filming
technology and techniques, have lured away more and more young
film goers from home grown movies.
</P>
<P>
"The integration of high-technology with film-making is a world
trend which we must follow," said Li Lianfa, a senior executive
with the Changchun Film Studio. "We must build our studios into
top class ones."
</P>
<P>
Miao Zhengming, a film technician, said that the new imports
will make the studios as advanced as some Hollywood companies.
</P>
<P>
China's movie industry, which produces some 140 films a year,
had earlier announced that it is also planning to make digital
films.

<HEADLINE> Chinese People Fall for Self-Service Shopping </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHENYANG, June 4 (Xinhua) -- Over 40 self-service supermarkets
have sprung up in Shenyang in the past few years, northeast
China's Liaoning Province, which have been warmly welcomed by the
local people.
</P>
<P>
Similar facilities have also appeared in many other economic
sectors including ATMs (Automatic Teller Machine), pay phones,
screen-touching computers, and automatic vending machines.
</P>
<P>
"Self-service enables us to avoid much trouble while buying
things," said a teacher in a city primary school.
</P>
<P>
And there are always customers inserting coins into the vending
machines at the entrance to a department store, for most consumers
think the facility is really convenient.
</P>
<P>
Yao Wei'an, director of the Shenyang Commercial Commission,
said that the traditional sales service often caused trouble and
quarrels between shop assistants and customers due to their
different education and characteristics. The new kind of service
has solved the problem.
</P>
<P>
The popularity of self-service also reflects people's new
consumer attitude. "We don't have much spare time to go shopping
nowadays, and supermarkets have enabled us to buy all that we need
at low prices. We can satisfy our daily needs by just coming to
such markets three or four times a month." said Wang Zhixue, a
company staff member.

<HEADLINE> UAE Economy to Grow 5 Percent in 1999 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ABU DHABI, June 4 (Xinhua) -- After economic difficulties last
year due to drop in oil prices, the gross domestic product (GDP)
of the United Arab Emirates (UAE) is expected to grow 5 percent
this year.
</P>
<P>
The expected growth this year will make up for the 5.5 percent
decrease in last year's GDP, said the New York-based credit rating
agency Thomson BankWatch in its latest report on the UAE.
</P>
<P>
The report predicted the UAE economy will gain its growth
momentum this year, with the trade balance forecast to remain
positive and increase by 48.5 percent after a sharp fall of 69
percent in 1998, the Gulf News reported on Friday.
</P>
<P>
While the current account balance will remain "slightly
negative," the external debt is expected to fall within 26.1
percent of the GDP, compared with 27.5 percent last year.
</P>
<P>
Inflation rate, which was around 3.4 percent last year, is
expected to increase by about 1 percent this year, the report
said.
</P>
<P>
"We believe that the UAE will succeed in carrying out a soft
landing in 1999. Dubai's solid non-oil sector and Sharjah's
growing manufacturing base, in addition to Abu Dhabi's riches
will ensure a certain degree of protection in case of relapse in
the oil market," it added.
</P>
<P>
Factors which contributed to the favorable rating of the UAE
economy are the country's well-diversified economic base, open
and free economy, considerable net overseas assets, substantial
oil and gas reserves, and stronger cooperation between emirates.

<HEADLINE> Chinese Premier Meets with DPRK Leader (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, June 4 (Xinhua) -- Chinese Premier Zhu Rongji said
that the Chinese government will continue to develop the
traditional friendship between China and the Democratic People's
Republic of Korea (DPRK).
</P>
<P>
Zhu made the remarks in his meeting with Kim Yong Nam,
president of the Presidium of the Supreme People's Assembly,
saying he believed Kim's visit will be crowned with success, thus
further cementing the growth and consolidation of Sino-DPRK ties.
</P>
<P>
"As neighboring countries sharing mountains and rivers along
the border, China and the DPRK enjoy a traditional friendship and
cooperation, which was initiated and fostered by the old
generation of revolutionaries of the two countries, and is well
grounded between the two peoples," he said.
</P>
<P>
The premier told the guests that the Chinese government and
people highly valued its ties with the DPRK and has made sincere
efforts in this regard for many years. Also, he said the two
peoples supported and inspired each other in their respective
socialist revolutions and constructions.
</P>
<P>
Kim briefed Zhu on the current situation of the DPRK. In the
wake of the formation of the new state organs, Kim said, General
Kim Jong Il instructed this state delegation to pay an official
goodwill visit to China, demonstrating the importance attached by
the Workers' Party of Korea (WPK) and the DPRK government to its
ties with China.
</P>
<P>
"Immediately after we stepped on the Chinese territory, we
received a warm reception, which really touched all the members of
the delegation," he said.

Kim said that the WPK and his people will unswervingly adhere
to their friendship with China no matter what occurs in the
international arena, for that was the will of the late President
Kim Il Sung and the determination of Kim Jong Il.
</P>
<P>
Kim and DPRK Premier Hong Song Nam spoke highly of China's
reform and opening-up policy, saying the policy was suitable to
China's national conditions and in the interest of the Chinese
people.
</P>
<P>
They also extended their congratulations to China for its
sustained economic growth while mitigating the impact of the
financial crisis and overcoming the rare flooding disaster last
year.
</P>
<P>
They wished China to continue pushing forward the socialist
cause with Chinese characteristics this year, when the 50th
founding anniversary of New China will be marked.
</P>
<P>
Zhu expressed his admiration for the unremitting efforts in
national construction made by the DPRK people under the leadership
of Kim Jong Il.
</P>
<P>
"Over the past years, China has provided assistance, within its
capacity, for the DPRK people in their socialist construction,"
Zhu said, adding it is an instance to China's importance to its
ties with the DPRK.
</P>
<P>
Taking into account the DPRK's current situation, Zhu said, the
Chinese government has decided to provide free 150,000 tons of
grain and 400,000 tons of coking coal this year.
</P>
<P>
The DPRK side extended its sincere gratitude for that and
highly valued all the economic assistance from the Chinese
government.

<HEADLINE> China Sees Growing Digital Camera Market </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, June 4 (Xinhua) -- China's demand for digital cameras
is expected to hit one million units in the year 2000, according
to a recent estimation by the State Administration of Machinery
Industry (SAMI).
</P>
<P>
China Township Enterprise News quoted the SAMI as saying that
China, one of the world's largest camera markets, accounts for
approximately 11 percent of the total camera sales worldwide.
</P>
<P>
Official statistics show 11 million cameras were sold in China
during 1998. Industry analysts predict that this year's sales
volume will top 12 million units.
</P>
<P>
The market is far from being saturated, with current statistics
showing only 30 cameras for every 100 urban families, and fewer
than 3 cameras for every 100 rural households, according to the
SAMI.
</P>
<P>
Continuous improvement of living standards and the purchase of
computers by more Chinese will increase the popularity of digital
cameras, according to the SAMI.
</P>
<P>
Market analysts also predict that production techniques will
mature and costs will fall in the future. The current cost of
digital cameras ranges from 2,000 yuan (240 U.S. dollars) to 10,
000 yuan, with the highly sophisticated cameras costing as much as
one million yuan. The latter cameras are mainly used by
journalists, passport offices, advertisers, insurance companies
and healthcare units.

<HEADLINE> Australian Wool Prices Slightly Up at Auctions </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, June 4 (Xinhua) -- Australian Wool prices rose
slightly at auctions this week with the eastern market indicator
finishing the week slightly higher.
</P>
<P>
The Australian Wool Industries Secretariat (AWIS) said in its
weekly report that the eastern market indicator finished the week
at 5.39 Australian dollars (3.5 U.S. dollars ) per kilogram clean.
</P>
<P>
The figure reflects increases of 5 Australian cents (3.2 U.S.
cents) in wool prices at auctions in northern Australian markets
and 2 Australian cents (1.3 U.S. cents) in the south following
sales in Sydney and Melbourne.
</P>
<P>
A total of 64,162 bales were offered for sale with 16 percent
passed in, comprising 13.4 percent in Sydney, 15.2 percent in
Melbourne and 18 percent in Fremantle, a small town in West
Australia.
</P>
<P>
AWIS said major demand continued to be from buyers for China
with top makers continuing to be among the more active buying
houses.
</P>
<P>
In its weekly bulletin, Wesfarmers Dalgety said current
quantities of wool were being absorbed by the market without
putting downward pressure on prices.
</P>
<P>
"Similar conditions are expected to prevail next week with
little market information providing a stimulus for movements one
way or anther," Wesfarmers said.
</P>
<P>
Sales continue in Sydney and Melbourne with 50,860 bales
rostered for sale.

<HEADLINE> Australia Welcomes Yugoslavia's Acceptance of Kosovo Peace Deal </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, June 4 (Xinhua) -- Australian Foreign Affairs
Minister Alexander Downer said Friday that his country welcomes
the prospects of peace in Kosovo after a "particularly ugly" war.
</P>
<P>
Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic has accepted the peace
plan put to him by Finnish President Martti Ahtisaari,
representing the European Union, and Russian Special Envoy Viktor
Chernomyrdin, under which Yugoslavia would pull its forces out of
Kosovo and allow U.N. peacekeeping forces in.
</P>
<P>
"We very much welcome the agreement that has been reached
between the Yugoslav authorities and the negotiators," Downer told
reporters.
</P>
<P>
"This is an important first step.
</P>
<P>
"The war has been a much longer war and rather an uglier war
than perhaps many people anticipated at the beginning and the
sooner it finishes the better, but obviously it has to finish on
appropriate terms."
</P>
<P>
Australia, a close ally of the United States and a supporter of
the U.S.-led NATO's air strikes against Yugoslavia, has maintained
a low profile since two Australian aid workers were arrested in
April by Yugoslavia on charges of spying for the NATO.

<HEADLINE> BOC to Suspend RMB Int'l Settlement Abroad </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, June 4 (Xinhua) -- The Bank of China (BOC), the
largest state foreign exchange bank, has recently notified its
branches abroad and its overseas agent banks to suspend
international settlements in Renminbi (RMB) yuan, the Chinese
currency, starting from June 10, 1999.
</P>
<P>
A BOC official said that the move means only a change in the
method of settlement and will not affect customers interest.
</P>
<P>
According to the current settlement practice, a remitter
outside China has to first change foreign currency into RMB
before making remittances to domestic BOC branches.
</P>
<P>
"From June 10, BOC branches abroad and its overseas agent banks
will directly transfer foreign currency to domestic banks, and it
is up to the recipient to decide whether to retain the foreign
currency or convert it into RMB," the official said.
</P>
<P>
A spokesman with the State Administration of Foreign Exchange (
SAFE) said today that the move is aimed at improving the reporting
of China's international payment statistics, and has nothing to do
with the policy of foreign exchange management or the exchange
rate of the yuan.
</P>
<P>
He added that the decision has also been announced on SAFE's
newly established website (http://www.safe.gov.cn).

<HEADLINE> Zambia's AIDS Orphans to Be One Million </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUSAKA, June 4 (Xinhua) -- Over one million Zambian children
would be orphans as a result of parents dying from AIDS by the
turn of the century, medical experts said.
</P>
<P>
Medical experts attending the workshop toward the International
 Conference on AIDS and sexually transmitted diseases in Africa
(ICASA) to be held here in September, said the HIV/AIDS epidemic
was affecting the country's social- economic development as
employees in key sector like education were dying from the
disease, Times of Zambia newspaper reported Friday.
</P>
<P>
About 1,500 teachers in Zambia died of AIDS in 1998 in the
ravages of the pandemic.
</P>
<P>
Statistics released in the workshop indicated that sub-Sahara
Africa still accounts for 70 percent of HIV/AIDS cases. Of the 34
million people infected with HIV/AIDS worldwide, 22.5 million were
in the region.
</P>
<P>
HIV/AIDS related tuberculosis (TB) cases were on the rise and
it was projected there would be a 40 percent increase of such
cases by the year 2000. Over six million people died of AIDS in
Africa last year, the statistics indicated.
</P>
<P>
Moses Sichone, coordinator of the ICASA conference, said at the
workshop that Africa only spent 140 million U.S. dollars annually
on HIV/AIDS mitigation programs and yet billions of dollars were
channelled into civil wars across the continent.
</P>
<P>
It was now a question of morality for big pharmaceutical
companies to avail Africa of HIV/AIDS drugs which reduce effects
of the disease considering the high prevalence of the disease on
the continent, he added.

<HEADLINE> AmCham Welcomes Decision of NTR Renewal </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, June 4 (Xinhua) -- The American Chamber of Commerce
in Hong Kong (AmCham) Friday expressed its welcome to U.S.
President Bill Clinton's decision to extend Normal Trade Relations
(NTR) status to China for another year.
</P>
<P>
"AmCham strongly believes that the renewal of NTR for China
without conditions is critical for a constructive U.S.-China
relationship, regional stability and recovery and the well-being
of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region," said AmCham
Chairman Jason Felton.
</P>
<P>
Felton said that AmCham will continue to spearhead support for
China's World Trade Organization (WTO) entry and NTR to China with
action calling on the U.S. administration and policy makers not to
lose sight of their bilateral goals.
</P>
<P>
Last month, AmCham, in conjunction with it U.S. member-
companies, launched a major letter-writing campaign to members of
the U.S. administration and Congress in support of China's WTO bid
and permanent NTR once a WTO accord is reached.
</P>
<P>
"Once an agreement is reached on WTO and a vote for permanent
NTR is to be taken, AmCham's obligation will be to ensure that all
members of Congress recognize how important such an agreement is
to American economic interests, world peace and global economic
stability," Felton concluded.

<HEADLINE> Vietnam's Major Coal Producer Suspends Production </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HANOI, June 4 (Xinhua) -- Mounting coal stockpiles have forced
the Vietnam Coal Corporation (Vinacoal) to suspend its production,
the Saigon Times Daily reported Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The English business newspaper, available here Friday, quoted
Vinacoal general director Doan Van Kien as saying that coal
production will be stalled until December in a desperate attempt
to halve the current stockpile, estimated at four million tons.
</P>
<P>
"The production stoppage," Kien told his mine workers in Quang
Ninh last Wednesday, "is the best choice for us to deal with the
current stockpiles, and only by doing that will the coal industry
be able to balance production and sales."
</P>
<P>
From its establishment in 1995 to before June, corporation
affiliates made great efforts to expand production, with total
output reaching 10.8 million tons by the end of 1997.
</P>
<P>
However, coal stockpiles then became a constant nightmare. In
1997, the stockpile was reported at over two million tons. In
1998, it grew to three million tons, and by late May this year,
four million tons.
</P>
<P>
Inappropriate attention to coal sales and the monopolistic
method of sales management have led to the current situation, said
The Saigon Times Daily.
</P>
<P>
Halting production is just a temporary solution and will lead
to the stagnation of other industries and difficulties for the
miners, said the daily, adding that in such a situation, the
government's help is badly needed.

<HEADLINE> Zimbabwe Encourages Private Investment </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, June 4 (Xinhua) -- The Reserve Bank of Zimbabwe has
said there is need to implement policies that promote and sustain
private investment in order to achieve high economic growth rates,
the daily Herald reported Friday.
</P>
<P>
The central bank said in its latest economic highlights issued
here Thursday that bold measures aimed at raising savings should
be taken to realize meaningful domestic investment.
</P>
<P>
"Given the country's diverse resource endowment and existing
technology, high levels of investments are achievable," it said.
</P>
<P>
The bank said private investment was crucial for economic
growth, the Zimbabwe Program for Economic and Social
Transformation (Zimprest) targeting it at a minimum of 18 percent
of the gross domestic product (GDP).
</P>
<P>
"In recent years, however, private investment has only
averaged less than 16 percent," it said.
</P>
<P>
The bank, however, said unless current macro-economic
imbalances in the economy were addressed, investment's
contribution to the GDP would remain low.
</P>
<P>
It said countries experiencing higher economic growth have
tended to realize increased private investment activity, since the
income created provided a strong market base.
</P>
<P>
Since 1995, real economic growth in the country had averaged
only two percent, which is lower than the population growth rate
of three percent, the bank said.
</P>
<P>
"The declining economic growth has also resulted in falling per
capita incomes, from 618 U.S. dollars in 1995 to 423 U.S. dollars
in 1998, leading to low levels of domestic demand," it said.
</P>
<P>
The current high domestic inflation rate of 52 percent had
adversely affected private investment activity by increasing the
riskiness of long- term investments, the bank noted.

<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, June 4 (Xinhua) -- The Hong Kong Special
Administrative Region Government Friday welcomed the U.S.
president's decision to renew China's Normal Trade Relations (NTR)
status (formerly known as Most Favored Nation status) for another
year without conditions attached.
</P>
<P>
A government spokesman said here that the decision to renew the
NTR trading status of China's mainland is good news for Hong Kong.
</P>
<P>
"The decision is conducive to boosting our business confidence
in Hong Kong," the spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
The United States and China's Mainland are Hong Kong's two
largest trading partners and good relations between them are of
vital importance to Hong Kong as a trading, financial and
investment center, he noted.
</P>
<P>
"NTR is the normal basis for conducting trade between economies.
We hope that this decision will strengthen the bilateral
relationship between our two largest trading partners," he said.

<HEADLINE> Yunnan Penalizes Polluter </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUNMING, June 4 (Xinhua) -- The Luxi Nitrogenous Fertilizer
plant in Luxi County, southwest China's Yunnan Province, was
recently fined 10,000 yuan for releasing wastewater rated far
below acceptable standards.
</P>
<P>
The move was part of the provincial government's effort to
intensify environmental protection measures on the eve of World
Environment Day.
</P>
<P>
The plant, which has an annual production capacity of 170,000
tons, was the first Yunnan enterprise since 1992 penalized for
operating without approval granted by the local environmental
protection department.
</P>
<P>
Yunnan issued detailed rules and regulations on environmental
protection in 1992 requiring all factories and plants to meet
environmental protection standards prior to entering operation.
</P>
<P>
The penalty also requires the plant to improve its
environmental protection measures within six months.
</P>
<P>
The plant's refurbished urea production line went into
operation at the end of 1998 prior to fulfilling standards
required by the local environmental protection department.
</P>
<P>
Wastewater released thereafter contained high levels of cyanide
which polluted downstream farmland and reduced crop outputs.
</P>
<P>
The United Nations General Assembly designated June 5 as World
Environment Day in 1972 in an effort to raise public awareness of
the need to protect the world's deteriorating environment.

<HEADLINE> Kenyan Shilling Slumps to Record Low </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, June 4 (Xinhua) -- The Kenyan shilling fell to a new
opening low, dragged down by speculative interbank trade, foreign
currency dealers said here Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The Central Bank of Kenya posted Thursday the shilling at a
mean opening of 72.88 to the U. S. dollar from 71.42 Wednesday,
the East African Standard newspaper reported Friday.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, commercial banks posted the shilling slightly lower
at 72.85/ 73.35 from 72.70/73.30 at Wednesday's close.
</P>
<P>
Local dealers said the shilling was heading toward 75 to the
dollar in a nervous market. They saw increased demand for dollar
from importers and government departments while dollar supply was
minimal due to falling inflow from the agricultural and tourism
sectors.
</P>
<P>
Dealers said they did not expect the central bank intervention
to prop up the shilling because a fall in the bank's foreign
exchange reserves left in a poor position to sustain intervention.
</P>
<P>
It is said that the official foreign exchange reserves fell to
698 million dollars in March from 832 dollars last November.
</P>
<P>
Kenyan Vice-President George Saitoti said Thursday that the
shilling's losses were welcome because they would boost kenyan
exports, but he cautioned they would put upward pressure on
inflation due to increases in the prices of imports.
</P>
<P>
Before this latest fall, the official opening low for the
shilling was 70.10 posted in August 1997 in the aftermath of a
decision by the International Monetary Fund to halt a
205-million-dollar aid package to Kenya.
</P>
<P>
Against the pound and euro, the Central Bank of Kenya Thursday
posted the shilling at a mean rate of 116.95 and 75.42
respectively, from 115.11 and 74.67 Wednesday.

<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, June 4 (Xinhua) -- The International Committee of
the Red Cross (ICRC) has handed over Indian pilot Nechiteka
Kambhampatito to the Indian High Commission here after Pakistan
released him late Thursday as a goodwill gesture.
</P>
<P>
"Under the auspices of the ICRC, the pilot was handed over by
the Ministry of Foreign Affairs in Islamabad to ICRC delegates,
who later brought him to the Indian High Commission in the same
city," said a statement from the ICRC office here Friday.
</P>
<P>
Pakistani Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif Thursday ordered the
release of the Indian pilot captured after his Mig fighter plane
was shot down last week in the Pakistani side of the Line of
Control in Kashmir.
</P>
<P>
Indian High Commissioner G. Parthasarty refused to receive the
officer of his country's air force in the presence of the ICRC
representative and international media.
</P>
<P>
The Pakistani Foreign Office late Thursday evening handed over
Indian Flight Lieutenant to Paul Bonard, head of the ICRC

<TEXT>
<P>
KAMPALA, June 4 (Xinhua) -- Uganda and Chad are expected to
exchange prisoners of war (POWs) they have captured during the war
in the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC).
</P>
<P>
James Kazini, chief of staff of Ugandan army and overall
commander of Ugandan troops in the DRC, told a press conference in
eastern Congo (K) Thursday that the Red Cross is at present
managing the matter, the Monitor daily reported Friday.
</P>
<P>
The Chadians said they were holding two Ugandan POWs while the
Ugandan side claimed that six Chadian soldiers were in their
hands.
</P>
<P>
They were captured in a series of confrontations between troops
of these two countries in the DRC in November of 1998, the Ugandan
commander said.
</P>
<P>
Soon after the eruption of rebellion in the DRC, Chadian troops
were invited to help the Congolese government troops. Uganda also
maintained a large military presence in Congo to allegedly protect
its borders there although it has been widely believed that the
Ugandan soldiers backed the Tutsi rebels.
</P>
<P>
To honor the cease-fire accord signed by three leaders of Chad,
Congo and Uganda in Libya on April 18, Chad withdrew its troops
out of Congo and Uganda has pulled out its soldiers from areas
occupied by Rwandan army.

with the daily average volume at 10.4 million Cyprus pounds (20.8
million U.S. dollars) from 20 million pounds (40 million dollars)
the week before.
</P>
<P>
However, current volume levels are considered very
satisfactory, given that last week's exceptionally high volume
levels cannot easily be sustainable in a stock market of a
relatively small size like the Cyprus market.
</P>
<P>
The total volume of transactions this four-day trading week
reached 41.5 million pounds (83 million dollars), as compared to
99.8 million pounds (199.6 million dollars) the week before.
</P>
<P>
The average daily volume was 10,377,000 pounds (20,755,000
dollars), compared to 19,964,000 pounds (39,928,000 dollars) the
previous week.

JOHANNESBURG, June 4 (Xinhua) -- The Confederation of African
Football (CAF) announced that it would not choose between the two
African countries which bid to host the 2006 World Cup finals.
</P>
<P>
Both Morocco and South Africa are sending delegations to the
confederation's headquarters, trying to get an endorsement to
strengthen their bid against rivals Brazil, England and Germany.

CAF press officer Viken Djizmedjian said: "We will hear from
both countries and find out how they are progressing. But we will
not make a choice."

<HEADLINE> Philippine Inflation Rate Down to 20-Month Low </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, June 4 (Xinhua) -- The inflation rate in the
Philippines went down to 6.7 percent in May 1999, the lowest since
a 6.5-percent rate was recorded in September 1997, bringing the
rate in the first five months to 8.9 percent.
</P>
<P>
A report of the National Statistics Office said Friday that the
inflation rate for all commodity groups except fuel, light and
water slowed down in May this year.
</P>
<P>
The rate for food, beverages and tobacco went down to 5.7
percent in May from 7.8 percent in April and the rate for housing
and repairs dropped to 8.9 percent from 9.4 percent, the office
said.
</P>
<P>
During the same period, the rate for services edged down to 9.1
percent from 9.3 percent, it said.
</P>
<P>
On the other hand, the inflation rate for fuel, light and water
picked up to 5.4 percent from 5 percent, the office said.
</P>
<P>
By regions of the country, the statistics showed that the
inflation rate for Metro Manila went down to 4.1 percent in May
from 6.7 percent in April.

percent in May from 8.5 percent a month earlier, the office said.

<HEADLINE> Donors to Provide $400M to Zambian Police </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUSAKA, June 4 (Xinhua) -- The Zambia Police Service and other
law enforcement agencies will receive about 400 million U.S.
dollars from donors to facilitate their work in strengthening
matters of good governance.
</P>
<P>
Bilateral and multilateral donors have started releasing the
Balance of Payments Supports (BOPs) pledged at the Paris Club
Consultative Group (CG) meeting last month.
</P>
<P>
Friday's Times of Zambia newspaper quoted Finance Minister
Edith Nawakwi as saying the donors had realized that the Zambia
Police Service needed immediate funding to help improve their
operations.
</P>
<P>
Speaking on arrival from Paris Club group meeting Thursday, the
minister said law enforcement agencies, including the
Anti-Corruption Commission and the Auditor-General's office needed
about 400 million dollars to reorganize and operate effectively.
</P>
<P>
She said donors were keen to support this program and asked
stake- holders to get united to successfully implement the
program.
</P>
<P>
According to the minister, the 1999 budget was fully funded
because cooperating partners had responded positively.
</P>
<P>
Zambia was also four months through on the Enhanced Structural
Adjustment Facility and once it is finished, the country would be
reconsidered for the Highly Indebted Poor Countries Initiative,
which was sponsored by the International Monetary Fund and the
World Bank to help provide debt relief in these countries.

<HEADLINE> Oil Prices to Go Up in Kenya </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, June 4 (Xinhua) -- The retail prices of petroleum
products in Kenya will go up due to the increased international
cost of crude oil and the depreciation of Kenyan shilling against
the U.S. dollar.
</P>
<P>
Local industry sources said Thursday that the Abu Dhabi
National Oil Corporation had pegged last month's Murban crude
price at 15.95 U.S. dollars per barrel, up from 15.45 dollars for
April, the East African Standard newspaper reported Friday.
</P>
<P>
The Abu Dhabi National Oil Corporation retrospectively
announces the previous month's crude oil prices at the beginning
of next month.
</P>
<P>
Officials from local oil marketing firms said pump prices would
be adjusted upwards in response to the crude oil hike of 45 cents
to 15.95 dollars.
</P>
<P>
They also noted that the pump prices increment was inevitable,
because the depreciation of the shilling against the dollar in
May by about five percent had compounded the situation.
</P>
<P>
The sources said the oil firms were computing margins of pump
price increment, which is expected to have a knock-on effect on
the economy.
</P>
<P>
ADNOC this January pegged December's crude oil cost at 10.25
dollars per barrel as world price fell to their lowest level since
1986.
</P>
<P>
Prices in the international market began to rise to their
highest level after the Organization of Petroleum Exporting
Countries (OPEC) meeting held in March in Vienna, Austria. To
bolster crude oil price, OPEC members reduced production by 1.7
million barrels per day for one year.

<HEADLINE> Thai Laborers Seek Higher Minimum Wage </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, June 4 (Xinhua) -- Thai labor leaders have called for
a new minimum daily wage of 200 baht (5.5 U.S. dollars) in Bangkok
and large cities nationwide, citing increasing inflation rates as
the reason, The Nation reported Friday.
</P>
<P>
Surprisingly, the demand was echoed by employers who asked for
a six-month time period to comply with, the newspaper said.
</P>
<P>
The current minimum wage in Bangkok and other large cities in
Thailand is 162 baht (4.4 dollars) per day.
</P>
<P>
Suwit Hathong, head of the Labor Congress of Thailand, recalled
Thursday that no labor groups asked for an increase from the
current minimum wage in October last year when they were supposed
to because all laborers realized the economic hardship the country
was facing.
</P>
<P>
However, he said the government, as a party to the Tripartite
Wage Committee, was obliged to provide an explanation now why
there was still no progress made to laborers' demands for the 38
baht (1.04 dollars) increase as eight months had passed.
</P>
<P>
He said laborers, like farmers and the jobless, should also
benefit from a large number of contracts made possible under
several foreign loans.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, a representative of the employers' group said the
employers had agreed to the laborers' demand for new minimum daily
wage, but asked that the new date be effective from January next
year.

<HEADLINE> New York to Persevere Without Ewing </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, June 3 (Xinhua) -- The New York Knicks had grown
used to playing with a Patrick Ewing who was not the dominant
figure of Knicks playoff games in the past. Now they will have to
get used to playing without Ewing entirely.
</P>
<P>
The news Wednesday afternoon that the franchise center would
miss the rest of the playoffs due to a partially torn tendon in
his left foot was sobering to every member of the Knicks
organization.
</P>
<P>
But coach Jeff Van Gundy said he expected the team to
demonstrate the same resolve that helped his team become the first
in NBA history to rise from the eighth and last seed in the
Eastern Conference to a spot in the Eastern Conference Finals.
Still, Van Gundy was realistic.
</P>
<P>
"Losing a great player doesn't help you," he said Wednesday. "
We're going to have to find some answers."
</P>
<P>
Those answers will have to come from Knicks frontline subs
Chris Dudley and Marcus Camby, who have both had some big moments
in the playoffs.
</P>
<P>
"We're confident we are going to come home and play well," said
Dudley. "We played well without Pat this year. We're all
devastated that this happened and we are disappointed for Pat
because we know how much we put into this, but I have confidence
in myself and everybody has confidence in us as a team."
</P>
<P>
Although Camby and Dudley will get Ewing's minutes, look for
Allan Houston and Larry Johnson to upgrade their offensive
contributions, as they did when Ewing missed most of last season
after breaking a bone in his wrist.
</P>
<P>
In Portland, the Trail Blazers are facing a must-win situation
in their first home game of the series Friday night. Although the
Blazers played well enough to show for it but an 0-2 deficit.
</P>
<P>
"We probably should be 1-1," said Portland coach Mike Dunleavy.
"With a little luck, we could be 2-0. With a little luck, they are
2-0."
</P>
<P>
Portland has had many outstanding moments from Rasheed Wallace,
Brian Grant and Arvydas Sabonis in this series, and have done a
reasonably good job against Tim Duncan and David Robinson. However,
the Blazers have suffered from breakdowns in offensive execution
at inopportune times, negating their often stellar play.
</P>
<P>
An infusion of offense from decision-making in crunch time
would serve Portland well as it aims to tie the series with a pair
of home victories Friday and Sunday.
</P>
<P>
San Antonio has won two games without any contribution from its
reserves (5-for-31) from field in two games. It's unlikely the
Spurs can win in Portland if that performance continues.

perhaps the greatest power forward in NBA history, Karl Malone of
the Utah Jazz today became the ninth multiple winner of the
league's Most Valuable Player (MVP) award.
</P>
<P>
Malone was voted as the NBA MVP for the second time in three
years, the league announced today. He received 827 points and 44
first-place votes from a panel of broadcasters and sports writers
throughout the United States and Canada.
</P>
<P>
"To win this award at age 35 after 14 years, it's great
personally," Malone said at a news conference this afternoon. "If
you play competitive sports and reach a certain age, they say when
you're 28, 29, 30, you're on the downward swing. At 35, I'm proud
to win this."
</P>
<P>
Miami Heat center Alonzo Mourning, the 1998-99 Defensive Player
of the Year, finished second with 773 points and 36 first-place
votes. San Antonio Spurs forward Tim Duncan was third with 740
points and 30 first-place votes.
</P>
<P>
Malone was named on 117 of 118 ballots, Mourning and Duncan
were named on 115 and 112 ballots, respectively.
</P>
<P>
Philadelphia 76ers guard Allen Iverson, the NBA scoring
champion, finished fourth in the voting with 319 points including

<HEADLINE> Houllier: Fowler not for Sale </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, June 3 (Xinhua) -- Liverpool manager Gerard Houllier
has pinned a "not for sale" notice on Robbie Fowler.
</P>
<P>
Reports that Arsenal, managed by Houllier's fellow Frenchman
Arsene Wenger, have launched a 12 million pounds bid to buy Fowler
were dismissed as "a fabrication" by the Liverpool chief.
</P>
<P>
The manager said: "Robbie is our player. He has recently signed
a new contract.
</P>
<P>
"We want to keep him and as far as I know he wants to stay.
That remains the case unless I hear something from him to the
contrary."
</P>
<P>
Another report that Liverpool are set to sign Arsenal's veteran
centre-back Steve Bould on a two-year contract could also be wide
of the mark.
</P>
<P>
Houllier is an admirer of the 36-year-old Bould who recently
signed a new one-year deal at Highbury and is due a lucrative
testimonial match.
</P>
<P>
But the Anfield chief has signed Blackburn central defender
Stephane Henchoz for an undisclosed fee subject to a medical.
</P>
<P>
The Swiss international had a clause in his contract which
allowed him to leave Ewood Park in the event of relegation.
</P>
<P>
And after Rovers' demotion to the First Division, the 24-year-
old has opted to join the Anfield club despite offers from
elsewhere on the Continent.

LONDON, June 3 (Xinhua) -- Rugby Football Union investigators
probing drugs allegations made against former England captain
Lawrence Dallaglio intend releasing their findings "as soon as
possible."
</P>
<P>
The three-man panel, chaired by High Court judge Sir John Kay,
will concentrate on three main areas.
</P>
<P>
These are allegations that Dallaglio took drugs while a player,
took drugs with others on the 1997 British Lions tour of South
Africa, and sold drugs for financial gain. Allegations against
Wasps flanker Dallaglio were made by the News of the World on
Sunday, May 23.
</P>
<P>
Dallaglio subsequently resigned the England captaincy - since
inherited by Leicester and Lions skipper Martin Johnson - and
withdrew from England's current World Cup training camp in
Australia.
</P>
<P>
But Dallaglio has denied ever using or dealing in drugs during
his rugby career - making particular reference to the 1997 Lions
tour - although he admitted experimenting with drugs as a teenager.
</P>
<P>
News of the World representatives have already met with RFU
enquiry panel members, and Dallaglio now faces an anxious wait
while investigations continue.

<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, June 4 (Xinhua) -- Iran and Ethiopia have signed a
memorandum of understanding to enhance scientific, economic and
technical cooperation.
</P>
<P>
The memorandum, inked at the end of the visit by Ethiopian
Foreign Minister Seyoum Mesfin Thursday afternoon, called for the
first joint Iran-Ethiopia commission in the year 2000, the Islamic
Republic News Agency (IRNA) reported on Friday.
</P>
<P>
Iranian Foreign Minister Kamal Kharrazi said that regional and
world developments were some of the topics discussed during
Mesfin's visit.
</P>
<P>
He said that "due to Ethiopia's role as an important member of
the Non-Aligned Movement and the U.N., we expect to have solid
south-south cooperation."
</P>
<P>
Iran and Ethiopia have solid grounds for expanding economic,
political and cultural relations, he added.
</P>
<P>
Investments in food industry, given the Ethiopian market of 60
million and its favorable agricultural climate, is feasible, he
said.
</P>
<P>
Kharrazi stressed that given the historical ties between the
two countries and recent discussion in Tehran, bilateral relations
will strengthen.
</P>
<P>
Mesfin, who arrived here on Wednesday, said that bilateral ties
will proceed in line with the two countries' mutual interest.

<HEADLINE> EU to Intervene in Dublin Match Row </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, June 3 (Xinhua) -- European soccer governing body UEFA
has called on the European Union to intervene in the continuing
row over the Republic of Ireland's decision to prevent the Euro
2000 match with Yugoslavia going ahead.
</P>
<P>
Dublin refused to grant the Yugoslav players entry visas
because of the Kosovo conflict, ensuring that Saturday's match
cannot go ahead.
</P>
<P>
UEFA has always insisted that it would not postpone the
qualifying game - but in a statement it accepted the contest "
cannot take place" because of the visa decision.
</P>
<P>
And now European football's governing body has asked the EU
presidency to clarify its position on sporting links with
Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
It wants the presidency to state whether the decision of the
Irish government is applicable throughout the EU.
</P>
<P>
UEFA has the power to eject Ireland from the European
Championships and it appears that the team's fate now rests with
the EU.
</P>
<P>
The Football Association of Ireland have attempted to distance
his organisation from the Irish Government's decision to refuse
visas to Yugoslavian footballers.
</P>
<P>
"This was a decision taken by the Government, we are not in a
position to either support it or condemn it," said FAI chief
executive and general secretary Bernard O'Byrne.
</P>
<P>
"Our line has always been consistent. This match could not and
should never have been ordered to take place on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
"UEFA have always known our view but they would not take the
decision to postpone the match. We have had to rely on a political
decision."
</P>
<P>
Ireland could face sanctions from European football's governing
body over their refusal to play the crucial qualifier as UEFA had
earlier warned that if the Yugoslav players were refused visas,
the Irish team could be thrown out of Euro 2000.

<HEADLINE> Shearer and Cole Lead England Hunt </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, June 3 (Xinhua) -- England soccer team manager Kevin
Keegan has put his faith in Alan Shearer and Andy Cole in
England's hunt for goals in the crucial Euro 2000 qualifier
against Sweden at Wembley on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
The manager also confirmed another free role for Paul Scholes,
who scored a hat-trick in the victory over Poland in March.
</P>
<P>
Elsewhere, Phillip Neville replaces his injured brother Gary at
right-back, and David Batty comes in for Steve McManaman, who
asked to be left out following the death of his mother.
</P>
<P>
Otherwise it is the same line-up that beat Poland, with Keegan
saying: "If it ain't broke, don't fix it."
</P>
<P>
There is no place in the starting line-up for Manchester
United's Teddy Sheringham, whose patchy season ended in glory with
heroic performances in the FA Cup and European Cup finals.
</P>
<P>
Much will be dependant on David Beckham, who is the recognised
creative influence in the central midfield area and was missing
when England lost in feeble fashion to Sweden in Stockholm last
autumn.
</P>
<P>
"I feel he has more to offer a team than playing on the right
but he's so influential there," said Keegan.
</P>
<P>
"He proved in the European Cup final that he can play in
central midfield.
</P>
<P>
"He's young and he's talented and it's good that he can play in
more than one position."
</P>
<P>
Beckham, who has been resting since United's treble triumph,
said he was happy to be involved with Keegan's England, which is
more relaxed than previous international set-ups.
</P>
<P>
He said: "I have had a week to get ready for this after the
European Cup.
</P>
<P>
"I have been away for a few days. It is great to be included in
the team - there are so many great players here.
</P>
<P>
"It is a great atmosphere but, yes, I am still on a high from
Europe. It hasn't hit me yet. It has been a massive year for us
but I feel fresh and am looking towards the next game.
</P>
<P>
"When new managers come in there are obviously going to be
changes. I think it is more relaxed but it is good to be in any
England team, " he added.

<HEADLINE> New Fears over Lewis-Holyfield Rematch </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, June 4 (Xinhua) -- The much-anticipated world heavywght
rematch between Lennox Lewis and Evander Holyfield has been thrown
into doubt, according to promoter Panos Eliades on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The original unification clash between the pair in March was
controversially declared a draw - despite most observers claiming
Britain's Lewis should have won.
</P>
<P>
A rematch has been planned for later in the year, backed by
flamboyant US promoter Don King.
</P>
<P>
But Eliades, who represents Lewis' camp, believes there is no
chance of the bout taking place, despite claims by King that the
fight is definitely on.
</P>
<P>
Negotiations for world title fights are notoriously complicated,
with so many different interests involved.
</P>
<P>
And Eliades believed the fight was likely to flounder,
following a breakdown in communication between the various parties.
</P>
<P>
Eliades said: "I'm having great difficulty in putting the fight
together and in my opinion I think this fight is not going to take
place."
</P>
<P>
His claims are backed by TV chiefs who have stated that no deal
has been struck.
</P>
<P>
King, however, had announced a deal with a Las Vegas casino
firm for hosting rights. Madison Square Garden had been vying with
Las Vegas bidders for a chance at the re-match.
</P>
<P>
Eliades said: "King made his statement last week saying he's
signed a six-fight deal including Holyfield-Lewis.
</P>
<P>
"But he's nowhere near signing Holyfield-Lewis - he's signed
Holyfield but (US TV station) HBO and King are at loggerheads.
</P>
<P>
"They can't get it together and it looks like it could fall
away unless I fly in next week and try to do a deal where King and
HBO will accept my proposition."
</P>
<P>
Television company officials in Las Vegas have also dismissed
King's rematch talk.
</P>
<P>
Lou DiBella, an executive with HBO, who along with Showtime own
pay-per-view rights to the two fighters, said: "There's no deal.
There are some problematic issues that need to be worked out."
</P>
<P>
Lewis was convinced he had beaten Holyfield when the bell went
at the end of the first meeting.
</P>
<P>
But when the judges' scores were announced the arena erupted in
a chorus of booing.
</P>
<P>
The three judges were split between Lewis, Holyfield and the
draw.

<HEADLINE> News Analysis: S.E Asian Currencies Riding Out of Crisis </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, June 4 (Xinhua) -- Southeast Asian currencies are
riding out the two-year-old financial crisis, and becoming more
stable and independent despite external risks.
</P>
<P>
The regional currencies have held their own ground so far this
year although the markets experienced a series of events which
could have triggered new financial turbulence.
</P>
<P>
When the year started, the launching of the euro and the
outbreak of a Brazilian crisis caused jitters in the world
financial market, but Southeast Asian currency markets remained
relatively calm, in contrast to the situation in the 1997-98
period.
</P>
<P>
Then, the continued weakness of the Japanese yen started to
challenge the position of the regional currencies, which fell by
20-80 percent in the crisis. As Southeast Asia's major creditor
and trading partner, Japan's currency movement always has a big
impact on the regional market.
</P>
<P>
However, when the Japanese yen, which depreciated to 140 to the
U.S. dollar last June and appreciated to 108 on January 4 this
year, fell again to the 120 level and lingered on since March,
Southeast Asian currencies continued to march to their own drum
beat rather than succumbing to that negative effect.
</P>
<P>
The Thai baht, which once fell to 57 to the dollar, has
remained at around 37 against the greenback in the past five
months, while the Philippine peso at around 38 to the dollar. In
January 1998, one dollar could buy 45 pesos.
</P>
<P>
When Indonesia experienced the worst part of the crisis, its
rupiah fell steeply to 13,000 to the dollar, but the currency has
maintained at the 8,000 level in recent months.
</P>
<P>
The good performance of Southeast Asian currency markets
indicates that the regional currencies have consolidated their own
ground.
</P>
<P>
The relatively stronger position of Southeast Asian currencies
could be attributed to the increasing foreign exchange reserves
and current account surplus in the region.
</P>
<P>
During the past five months, most Southeast Asian countries'
foreign exchange reserves have increased substantially, reaching
or approaching to their pre-crisis level. In the Philippines,
foreign exchange reserves have risen to 13 billion dollars now
from 8.8 billion dollars at the end of 1997 as a result of new
borrowings and more export revenues.
</P>
<P>
The current account surplus is also a major factor which has
helped Southeast Asian nations firm their currency position. In
1997, Southeast Asian countries' current account deficit accounted
for 3.3 percent of their gross domestic product (GDP). But in
1998, these countries enjoyed a current account surplus of 5.2
percent of GDP.
</P>
<P>
Although most of the improvement came from import reductions,
Southeast Asian countries could continue to achieve a current
account surplus of 4.4 percent this year when their imports
started to grow.
</P>
<P>
The surplus, economists say, means that U.S. dollars are
pouring into central bank coffers, boosting foreign exchange
reserves and keeping off negative effects on the regional
currencies.
</P>
<P>
In the meantime, the on-going economic recovery in the region
is also consolidating the regional currencies. According to
official figures, South Korea's GDP grew by 4.6 percent in the
first quarter of this year, while that of the Philippines and
Singapore by 1.2 percent respectively.
</P>
<P>
The modest growth in Southeast Asian economies has reversed the
region's economic contraction last year, and boosted people's
confidence in the currency market. Less hedge purchases of the
dollar and less speculative activities by companies and
individuals in the region this year have reduced the pressure on
the regional currencies.
</P>
<P>
With the recovery maintaining its momentum, the regional
currencies are expected to become more stable and independent in
the months ahead, experts said.

<HEADLINE> Bangladesh Requires Permit for Import of Pesticides </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DHAKA, June 4 (Xinhua) -- The Bangladeshi government has issued
an order to prohibit the import, production and marketing of
pesticides without registration in a bid to check their harmful
effects.

<P>
Under the Pesticide Ordinance and Regulations, import,
production, stockpiling, advertisement, repackaging, use and sale

<HEADLINE> Canada, United States Reach Agreement on Pacific Salmon </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
OTTAWA, June 3 (Xinhua) -- Canada and the United States
announced here Thursday that they have reached an agreement on the
elements of a ten-year accord to conserve and manage Pacific
salmon.
</P>
<P>
The agreement represents a victory for all those on both sides
of the border interested in salmon conservation and the long-term
viability of their salmon industries, said Canadian Foreign
Affairs Minister Lloyd Axworthy and U.S. Secretary of State
Madeleine Alberight in a joint statement issued here Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The comprehensive agreement, reached through vigorous diplomacy
among the responsible parties, is designed to ensure the
sustentation of the five Pacific salmon species through a
combination of scientific co-operation, in addition to providing
new funds to improve fisheries management and aid recovery of
weakened salmon stocks. The agreement is also necessary to limit
on salmon catches, said the joint statement.
</P>
<P>
Under the accord, the U.S. will provide 142 million U.S.
dollars to a conservation fund to help rebuild stocks and habitat
on both sides of the border.
</P>
<P>
It is a good deal because conservation means more fish for the
future, said Canadian Fisheries Minister David Anderson.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. catch of Fraser River salmon will be limited under 16.
5 percent, down from an historical average of about 20 percent,
while U.S. fishermen took 25 percent last year.
</P>
<P>
The Pacific Salmon treaty was first negotiated in 1985 to
divide the salmon catch between U.S. and Canadian fishermen based
on how many fish were spawned in each country.
</P>
<P>
However, sections that dictated how to do that expired in 1992.
Since then, there have been a series of failed and sometimes
hostile negotiations for a new agreement.

</P>
<P>
The Maungtaw area has 4,514 hectares of embankment for prawn
breeding, producing about 600,000 kilos annually.
</P>
<P>
Myanmar and Bangladesh, bordering the Bay of Bengal, initiated
formal border trade in September 1995 at the Maungtaw (Myanmar)
and Teknaf (Bangladesh) trade points.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Myanmar is also planning to build a new modern and
international-level fish and prawn wholesale center in Myeik, the

<HEADLINE> Vietnam's Rubber Industry Faces Difficulties </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HANOI, June 4 (Xinhua) -- Vietnam's rubber industry has been in
a crisis since last year when latex prices on the world market did
a nose-dive, the local press reported Friday.
</P>
<P>
This year, the price of unprocessed latex dropped to 550-600
U.S. dollars per ton from 690 U.S. dollars last year and 1,160
U.S. dollars in 1997.
</P>
<P>
Last year, the Vietnam Rubber Corporation produced nearly
170,000 tons of latex and sold 162,000 tons to earn 1,427 billion
Vietnamese dong (VND) (103 million U.S. dollars), down 37 billion
VND (2.66 million U.S. dollars) from the previous year due to
plummeting world prices.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, many Vietnamese latex companies suffered serious
losses because of higher production cost.
</P>
<P>
Vietnam's rubber industry is preparing for what could be the
largest shift in processing technology to address the changed
world market, the reports quoted Vietnamese analysts as saying.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Business Leaders Support Extending NTR to China </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, June 3 (Xinhua) -- Leaders of the U.S. business
community on Thursday voiced their strong support for President
Bill Clinton's decision to extend the annual Normal Trade
Relations (NTR) to China and for continued efforts to finalize an
agreement on China's entry into the World Trade Organization (WTO).
</P>
<P>
Thomas J. Donohue, president of the U.S. Chamber of Commerce,
said in a news release that the Clinton Administration's decision
to extend the NTR to China for another year is "the right step for
American businesses and workers."
</P>
<P>
He urged the administration and Congress to press ahead with
granting China a permanent NTR status once the talks on its
accession to the WTO are concluded.
</P>
<P>
"We are undertaking a major campaign to secure congressional
support for the NTR," said Donohue. "It is important to remember
though that this is just the first step. In the near future, we
want to see the Administration and Congress make China NTR
permanent."
</P>
<P>
Donohue said that American companies and workers "have a huge
stake in U.S.-China commercial relations," and "opening China's
markets is essential to U.S. interests."
</P>
<P>
In 1998, the United States exported over 14 billion dollars in
goods and services to China, providing hundreds of thousands of
high-wage American jobs, according to the news release from the U.
S. Chamber of Commerce, the world's largest business federation
representing more than three million businesses and organizations
of every size, sector and region.
</P>
<P>
Philip M. Condit, chairman of the Business Roundtable,
described Clinton's decision to renew China's NTR as "the right
thing to do," and "a vital step toward normalizing our economic
relationship with China."
</P>
<P>
"Trade with China is a cornerstone of a stable U.S.-China
relationship and presents Americans with unprecedented
opportunities with the world's most-populous country," Condit said
in a statement issued here on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Condit, also chairman of the Boeing Company, stressed that it
is critical to go on settling the remaining U.S.-China trade
issues "so that we can achieve the important objectives of China's
admission into the WTO and permanent NTR status, which will enable
the United States to reap the benefits of China's WTO membership."
</P>
<P>
"Accomplishing these objectives this year will help assure U.S.
competitiveness in the new millennium," he said.
</P>
<P>
Ruth R. Harkin, senior vice president for International Affairs
and Government Relations of United Technologies Corporation and
chair of United Technologies International, also applauded
Clinton's call for a continued NTR to China.
</P>
<P>
"In addition, we're hopeful the U.S. government can reach a
commercially viable market access agreement with the Chinese and
grant China permanent Normal Trade Relations," she said in a
statement.
</P>
<P>
"As the fastest growing market for U.S. exports, China is
critical to the viability of our future U.S. economy," she said.
</P>
<P>
The NTR is formerly called MFN (Most Favored Nation), a
reciprocal and mutually beneficial arrangement between China and
the United States in light with an agreement reached by the two
sides in 1979. But under U.S. law, China's MFN status should be
renewed annually by the U.S. government.
</P>
<P>
In July 1998, President Clinton signed into law a bill on
reforms in the internal revenue service which quietly changed the
term of MFN to NTR -- Normal Trade Relations.

<P>
Indonesia, the fourth most populous nation in the world, will
hold general elections (parliamentary elections) on June 7, 1999,
described as the most democratic multi-party elections in 30
years.
</P>
<P>
The forthcoming elections will be the eighth one since
Indonesia gained independence in 1945 and the seventh since the
New Order government ruled by former president Soeharto who
stepped down in May last year amid the country's worst political
and economic crisis.
</P>
<P>
The country's 127.6 million eligible voters will elect 462
members to the 500-seat House of Representatives (DPR). The
remaining 38 seats are reserved for the Armed Forces which do not
vote.
</P>
<P>
Voting begins at 8:00 a.m. local time (0100 GMT) and closes at
2:00 p.m. (0700 GMT).
</P>
<P>
The General Election Commission (KPU) has announced a permanent
list of 11,583 legislative candidates put forward by all
contesting parties. The figure does not include 38 military
representatives in the DPR.
</P>
<P>
Approximately 250,000 polling stations will be used for the
election. The tabulation of the votes will be accomplished first
at each polling station. A copy of the results will be given to
party representatives and accredited monitoring organizations and
posted at each polling place.
</P>
<P>
The results from the polling stations are then consolidated at
approximately 67,000 villages. The village consolidations and
copies of polling station results are sent to approximately 4,000
sub-districts for additional consolidation and transmission to 314
districts and then to 27 provincial offices for final
consolidation. This process takes several days.
</P>
<P>
KPU officials have said the preliminary results of the election
could be announced on June 9 if things go smoothly. Final district
assembly results should be released on June 28, final provincial
assembly results on July 1 and final official parliament results
on July 6.
</P>
<P>
The upcoming general elections will be different from the
previous ones, with as many as 48 political parties contesting. In
the past 30 years, only three parties were allowed to contest.
There are now a total of 148 political parties in Indonesia.

<TEXT>
<P>
The General Session of the People's Consultative Assembly
(Majelis Permusyawaratan Rakyat or MPR), Indonesia's highest
legislative body, decided in November 1998 to hold general
elections on June 1999. At the end of this year, the newly-elected
MPR will elect a new president and vice president for 1999/2004.
</P>
<P>
Sovereignty is in the hands of the people and is exercised in
full by the MPR as the embodiment of the whole Indonesian people.
The People's Consultative Assembly is to be distinguished from the
legislative body proper -- Dewan Perwakilan Rakyat (House of
Representatives or DPR) which is incorporated in the MPR.
</P>
<P>
In the upcoming general elections, the MPR will have 700
members who serve for five years, including 500 members from the
DPR and 200 presidential appointees (135 from regional
representatives and 65 from functional representatives).
</P>
<P>
The MPR is required to meet once every 5 years, and its duties
include electing the president and vice president, amending the
Constitution and approving the broad policy aims of the
government.
</P>
<P>
The 500-member DPR exercises legislative authority. In the
coming election, 462 members will be directly elected, and the
remaining 38 seats will be reserved for the Armed Forces which do
not vote.
</P>
<P>
The DPR meets at least once a year. All laws must have the
approval of the DPR, but the president has an absolute veto.
Members of the DPR have the right to submit draft bills which
require ratification by the president. The president may enact
ordinances during times of emergency, which however must be either
ratified or revoked by the DPR during its following session.
</P>
<P>
All political parties contesting the election are allowed to
and have put forward their presidential candidates to the MPR's
five-yearly General Session, which is scheduled for November this
year. According to electoral rules, a candidate could be elected
by getting more than half votes from the 700-member MPR.
</P>
<P>
From 1967 to 1997, former president Soeharto had been elected
for six times running since there was only one presidential
candidate. Incumbent President B.J. Habibie has been nominated by
the ruling Golkar Party as its presidential candidate for
1999/2004.

<HEADLINE> Facts and Figures About Indonesia (4) - Key Political Parties (Part One) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Indonesia will hold a multi-party general election on June 7,
in which 48 out of more than 140 political parties in the country
will be contesting.
</P>
<P>
The following are the introduction of several major parties
with the best chance to win in the polls:
</P>
<P>
-- The United Development Party (PPP).
</P>
<P>
As one of the only three political parties allowed to contest
the general elections in the past 30 years when former president
Soeharto was in power, PPP has returned to its founding principle
of Islam since the advent of the present reform era. This is
marked by the use again of the Kabah (the small cubicle shrine in
the Great Mosque of Mecca which contains the famous Black Stone of
Mecca) as its party symbol.
</P>
<P>
The party was set up in 1973 as a fusion of four Islamic
parties -- the Nahdlatul Ulama Party, the Indonesian Muslimin
Party, Partai Syarikat Islam Indonesia and Perti Islam Party. Most
of the party's constituents are Ulema (Muslim scholars) and
students of Pesantren (Islamic boarding school) in the rural
areas, mainly in Java.
</P>
<P>
There is no official information about the size of the party's
membership.
</P>
<P>
The PPP has been weakened since many members of the Nahdlatul
Ulama Party, the country's largest Muslim organization, withdrew
from it in 1998. Obviously, the existence of other Islamic parties
as participants of the 1999 general election, constitutes a
competition in obtaining votes. More over, several prominent
figures of those Islamic parties used to be well-known figures of
PPP.
</P>
<P>
The firm stance that PPP showed in the 1998 extraordinary
session of the People's Consultative Assembly (MPR) is viewed as
one of the factors that have increased the party's popularity. At
the session, PPP urged the MPR to abolish the political function
of the Armed Forces by dismissing military membership in the
parliament and pushing forward the investigation into the wealth
of former president Soeharto.
</P>
<P>
In its program, PPP has decided that in the future it will
continue to fight for a democratic national life by putting in
proper place the functions of the Armed Forces, the House of
Representatives (DPR), the president and other state institutions.
With an Islam base, PPP wants to fight for a democratic political
order based on Akhlakul Karimah (generous morals) and develop an
Islamic life.
</P>
<P>
-- The Golkar Party.
</P>
<P>
The Golkar Party is the continuation of the ruling Golongan
Karya (Golkar, Functional Group), which since the establishment of
the New Order administration in 1967, has been dominating the
legislative body.
</P>
<P>
The Golkar, set up by a group of military and civilian leaders
in 1966, claims a membership of 36 million out of a population of
207 million in the country.
</P>
<P>
The Golkar, which has won the last six elections, won more than
74 percent of the votes in the general election held in May 1997
as it enjoyed full backing from the military, government
bureaucracy and leading businessmen.
</P>
<P>
However, the Golkar has split since former president Soeharto
stepped down last year and some leading members have formed their
own parties.
</P>
<P>
Faced with the new situation, Golkar has repositioned itself.
Through the Special National Consensus in July 1997, Golkar has
produced a new paradigm. This was shown in the existence of a more
democratic process of the election of its chairman, and the
abolition of the Supervisory Board Institution and the three ABG
(Armed Forces, Bureaucrats and Golkar) lines. Besides, Golkar has
also admitted and apologized for its past mistakes.
</P>
<P>
The Golkar was officially declared a political party in March
this year. Golkar says it observes the necessity of developing the
people's economy which has a strong potential to strengthen
fundamentally the nation's economy.

<HEADLINE> Facts and Figures About Indonesia (5) - Key Political Parties (Part Two) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
-- The Indonesian Democratic Party of Struggle (PDI
Perjuangan).
</P>
<P>
PDI Perjuangan was born out of a protracted dispute within the
Indonesian Democratic Party (PDI), an alliance of several
Christian and nationalist parties set up in 1973. At the
government-backed PDI Congress on June 20-21, 1996 in Medan, North
Sumatera, several members of the PDI leadership openly ignored the
leadership which at that moment was held by Megawati
Soekarnoputri, the eldest daughter of late founding president
Soekarno. The move led to riots in Jakarta later that year.
</P>
<P>
This situation forced most of the PDI supporters to organize a
congress in Bali in October 1998 to declare their own existence,
separate from the PDI led by Budi Hardjono. The PDI group led by
Megawati as a result of the Bali Congress finally agreed to add
the word "Perjuangan" (Struggle) after the word PDI to
differentiate it from the other PDI group.
</P>
<P>
As was committed at Congress V in Bali, the party, determined
to win the 1999 general election, appointed Megawati as the
presidential candidate at the General Session of the People's
Consultative Assembly in 1999. One of the party's proclaimed aims
is to continue to defend the form of a unitary state, as was
aspired previously.
</P>
<P>
-- The National Mandate Party (PAN).
</P>
<P>
The establishment of the party was brought about by the
People's Mandate Council (Mara), one of the reform movement organs
during the era of Soeharto's administration.
</P>
<P>
Mara was declared on May 14, 1998 in Jakarta by 50 prominent
national figures including Prof. Dr. H. Amien Rais, former general
chairperson of Muhammadiyah, the second largest Muslim
organization in the country.
</P>
<P>
At a meeting held on August 5-6, 1998 in Bogor, West Java, they
agreed to form the Partai Amanat Bangsa, which later became the
PAN.
</P>
<P>
PAN has the aim to respect and maintain the people's
sovereignty, justice, material and spiritual progress. The party's
aspirations are rooted in religious morals, humanity and
plurality.
</P>
<P>
Besides, PAN also adheres to the non-sectarian and
non-discriminative principle. To create a new Indonesia, PAN has
the courage to bring up the idea of a dialogue on the form of a
federal republic state as an answer to the threat of
disintegration. The central point of the dialogue is the fairness
in the management of resources so that people can truly feel
themselves as members of the nation.
</P>
<P>
-- The National Awakening Party (PKB).
</P>
<P>
The PKB emerged as a response to the proposal of members of
Nahdlatul Ulama (NU) of all corners of the country who want the
presence of a container which could accommodate the political
aspirations of the NU community. The Board of Management of NU
later served as midwife at the birth of PKB.
</P>
<P>
The PKB was born through an intensive process of assessments.
The PKB is a "part of the NU people," and at the same time also
became a party with the characteristics of nationalism and
democracy, open to whoever, in the sense of cross religion,
ethnic, race and class.
</P>
<P>
The PKB, which is fully supported by KH. Abdurrahman Wahid,
popularly known as Gus Dur, general chairman of Indonesia's
largest Muslim organization NU with around 35 million members. At
present, PKB is striving towards the restoration of people's
sovereignty, justice and unity.

<TEXT>
<P>
In the 14th century, a Hindu kingdom of Majapahit was
established on the islands of Indonesia and had its capital in
eastern Java. The Portuguese arrived in the 16th century and set
up trading posts. Beginning in 1602, the Dutch slowly established
themselves as rulers of all the islands comprising present-day
Indonesia.
</P>
<P>
Nationalist opposition to colonial rule began in the early 20th
century. During the Second World War the territory was occupied by
Japanese forces starting from March 1942. On August 17, 1945,
three days after the Japanese surrender, a group of nationalists
proclaimed the independence of Indonesia from the Netherlands.
</P>
<P>
The first president of the self-proclaimed republic was Dr.
Soekarno, a leader of the nationalist movement since the 1920s.
After four years of intermittent warfare and negotiations between
the Dutch authorities and the nationalists, an agreement was
reached on a formal transfer of power. On December 27, 1949 the
United States of Indonesia became legally independent, with Dr.
Soekarno continuing as president.
</P>
<P>
In August 1950, the federation was dissolved and the country
became the unitary Republic of Indonesia. Under President
Soekarno's rule, Indonesia played a leading role in the
Non-Aligned Movement. But inflation and widespread corruption
provoked opposition to his rule. In September 1965, there was an
abortive military coup and in March 1966 President Soekarno was
forced to transfer executive powers to Gen. Soeharto, chief of
staff of the army.
</P>
<P>
In March 1967, the People's Consultative Assembly removed
Soekarno from office and named Gen. Soeharto as acting president.
Soeharto became prime minister in October 1967 and after his
election by the assembly, he was inaugurated as president in March
1968. He was re-elected in 1973, 1978, 1983 and 1988 until May of
1998, when Bacharuddin Jusuf Habibie succeeded him as president.

supported by oil and natural gas exports and diversified in the
1980s to create a wide-ranging manufacturing base. However, the
country's economy has been hit badly since July 1997 by the

<HEADLINE> Profile: Habibie - Ruling Golkar's Presidential Candidate </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JARKARTA, June 4 (Xinhua) -- Bacharuddin Jusuf Habibie, the
incumbent president of Indonesia, is the sole presidential
candidate for the 1999/2004 term of the ruling Golkar Party which
is a major party contesting in the parliamentary elections
scheduled for June 7.
</P>
<P>
Born in the remote village of Nepo, Parepare, South Sulawesi,
on June 25, 1936, Habibie was brought up in a strictly religious
Muslim family.
</P>
<P>
Habibie is the third of four children. He began reading
newspapers when he was a child. His lifelong religious devotion
continues in adulthood.
</P>
<P>
His father, Jali Habibie from the South Sulawesi town of
Gorontalo, died when Habibie was 13 years old. Then his Javanese
mother brought her children to Bandung, West Java.
</P>
<P>
After attending the Bandung Institute of Technology for about a
year in 1954, Habibie won a scholarship from the Ministry of
Education and Culture to study aircraft construction engineering
in Aachen, West Germany, a course he completed in 1960.
</P>
<P>
As a research assistant at Aachen's Technische Hocheschule
(1960-65), Habibie created a design of deep sea submarine and a
high-pressured and temperature room for Julich Atomic Center.
</P>
<P>
In 1974, President Soeharto called Habibie home and assigned
him to be his technological consultant. He was state minister of
research and technology from 1978 to March 1998.
</P>
<P>
The strengths of Habibie, who was elected as vice president on
March 11 last year at the general session of the People's
Consultative Assembly, include his popularity among the majority
Muslim community, the esteem he holds among youths and his long
service as state minister.
</P>
<P>
B.J. Habibie was sworn in as president on May 21, 1998 after
Soeharto resigned amid the country's worst political and economic
crisis.
</P>
<P>
In the last one year since he assumed the presidential office,
Habibie and his government have launched several political and
economic reforms including the release of political prisoners,
press freedom and the holding of a multi-party election to push
forward the political and economic democracy process in the
country.

<HEADLINE> Profile: Abdurrahman Wahid - Leader of Indonesia's Largest Muslim Group </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JARKARTA, June 4 (Xinhua) -- Abdurrahman Wahid is the general
chairman of Nahdlatul Ulama (NU), the largest Muslim organization
in Indonesia with around 30 million members.
</P>
<P>
He has been nominated by the National Awakening Party as the
presidential candidate to contest the presidential election.
</P>
<P>
Born in Jombang, East Java, on August 4 1940, Abdurrahman
Wahid, affectionately known Gus Dur, is the eldest of six
brothers. His farther A. Wahid Hasyim was a religion minister.
Abdurrahman Wahid studied at a number of Pesantren, or traditional
Islamic boarding schools in Java before undertaking tertiary level
studies at the Al-Azhar Islamic University in Cairo, Egypt in
1964. From Al-Azhar he went on to further studies in the field of
literature at the University of Baghdad in Iraq in 1966, and
returned to Indonesia in 1970.
</P>
<P>
From 1972 to 1974, he was dean of the Faculty of Theology
(Ushuludin) at the Hasjim Asyari University in Jombang. From 1974
to 1980, he was secretary-general of the Tebuireng Pesantren in
Jombang. In 1978, he took up the leadership of Pesantren Ciganjur
in South Jakarta. Having moved to Jakarta in 1978, Abdurrahman
Wahid became increasingly involved with the national leadership of
NU. He was made first secretary (Katib Awal) of the NU Supreme
Religious Council (Syuriyah) in 1979 in Jakarta.
</P>
<P>
In December 1984, at a five-yearly National Congress meeting of
NU, Abdurrahman Wahid was elected NU general chairman. In 1989 and
1994, he was re-elected NU general chairman and he holds the post
till now.
</P>
<P>
In the early years of his chairmanship of NU, the government
welcomed Abdurrahman Wahid's presence as a voice for moderation
and stability. In recent years, however, he has increasingly been
seen as an opposition figure after he, together with some leading
public intellectuals, launched the ginger group "Forum Demokrasi"
(Democratic Forum) to campaign for democratic reform. His public
criticism of former president Soeharto resulted in him being
placed under considerable political pressure.
</P>
<P>
Abdurrahman Wahid upholds Islamic education and national
reconciliation.
</P>
<P>
He was married with Nuriyah in 1968 and has four children.

<P>
JARKARTA, June 4 (Xinhua) -- Dyah Permata Megawati Setyawati
Soekarno Putri is the eldest daughter of late founding president
Soekarno and the general chairman of the Indonesian Democratic
Party of Struggle (PDI Perjuangan), a major party contesting in
the general election scheduled for June 7.
</P>
<P>
Megawati Soekarno Putri was born in Jakarta, capital of
Indonesia, on January 23, 1947. After finishing her primary and
secondary education in Jakarta from 1954 to 1963, She studied
agricultural subjects at the Padjadjaran University in Bandung,
West Java, from 1965 to 1967. And then she studied philosophy at
the Indonesian University in Jakarta from 1970 to 1972.
</P>
<P>
Nurtured in the political atmosphere of her family, especially
the influence of her farther Soekarno, Megawati was very
interested in politics as she was young. However, she had been
suppressed to be engaged in political activities for about 20
years after Soeharto replaced her farther as the second president
of Indonesia in 1967. Megawati shot into fame when she helped the
Indonesian Democratic Party (PDI) to obtain votes in the 1987
general election. In 1993, she was elected general chairman of the
PDI.
</P>
<P>
However, Megawati was ousted from the PDI leadership by a
government-backed group in 1996 at a congress held in Medan, North
Sumatera. The move led to riots in Jakarta later that year and
helped secure her position as a leading proponent of reform.
</P>
<P>
In October 1998, Megawati was elected general chairman of the
Indonesian Democratic Party of Struggle when most PDI members
separated from the government-backed PDI led by Budi Hardjono.
</P>
<P>
Megawati has become the most popular political figure in the
country and been nominated by her party as the presidential
candidate for the 1999/2004 period.

<HEADLINE> Indonesian Banks to Be Prodded to Cut Debt Level </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, June 4 (Xinhua) -- Bank Indonesia, the central bank,
will push the country's surviving banks to cut the level of
nonperforming loans from about 60 percent at present to around 5
percent by 2001, The Jakarta Post reported Friday.
</P>
<P>
Deputy governor Subarjo Joyosumarto said that Bank Indonesia
has formed a debt restructuring task force to achieve the target.
</P>
<P>
He said the task force has a mission to help the banks clean up
between 84.5 trillion rupiah (10.56 billion U.S. dollars) to 94.5
trillion rupiah (11.81 billion dollars) in nonperforming loans
within the next two years.
</P>
<P>
"We'll make efforts to clean up the nonperforming loans of all
banks so that the level won't exceed 5 percent by 2001," he said.
</P>
<P>
Subarjo said the task force would play a mediator role between
the banks and the debtors to restructure the problem loans.
</P>
<P>
"Most of the nonperforming loans are owed by businesses
operating in the trade, industry and construction sectors," he
said.
</P>
<P>
He said that Bank Indonesia's task force would handle
nonperforming loans not taken over by the Indonesian Bank
Restructuring Agency (IBRA).
</P>
<P>
IBRA has collected over 220 trillion rupiah (27.497 billion
dollars) in nonperforming loans from the country's seven state
banks, nine private banks which are being recapitalized by the
government, and 11 banks either taken over or closed-down.
</P>
<P>
Subarjo said that domestic banks could not start lending
without efforts to clean up the nonperforming loans.
</P>
<P>
"Bank Indonesia is now concentrating in restructuring the
nonperforming loans in order to make the banks healthy," he said.

SOFIA, June 3 (Xinhua) -- The end of war is in sight, Slovak
Foreign Minister Eduard Kukan, who is visiting Bulgaria as special
envoy of UN Secretary General Kofi Annan for Kosovo, said after
meeting Bulgarian President Peter Stoyanov.
</P>
<P>
Kukan described the Serbian parliament's acceptance of the G8
peace plan Thursday as a good basis for ending the Kosovo crisis,
but stressed that it is important to learn the details.
</P>
<P>
He said that the next step would be the adoption of a
resolution by the UN Security Council based on the principles laid
down by G8. Though without committing himself to a time limit, he
said he hoped this would be a matter of days or weeks but not a
month.
</P>
<P>
Kukan arrived here after visiting Romania and is scheduled to
leave for Macedonia.
</P>
<P>
President Stoyanov expressed to Kukan Bulgaria's wish to take
a direct part in the postwar reconstruction of the region and
confirmed its readiness to join the peacekeeping operation after
the achievement of a peace agreement.
</P>
<P>
Earlier on Thursday, Kukan also had a meeting with Bulgarian
Foreign Minister Nadezhda Mihailova to discuss the UN role in the

<HEADLINE> Chile Satisfied with Approval of Border Treaty </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SANTIAGO, June 3 (Xinhua)-- Chile's Foreign Minister Jose
Miguel Insulza expressed Thursday his satisfaction for the
approval of the border treaty of Campo de Hielo Sur signed with
Argentina.
</P>
<P>
Chile's Chamber of Deputies and Argentina's Senate approved
last evening this agreement, signed by the presidents of both
countries last December 16, putting an end to the last territorial
dispute between the two nations.
</P>
<P>
Insulza said that the approval reflects a historic moment in
the relations with Argentina, describing it as something "
significant."
</P>
<P>
The minister held that the advantages of putting the border
affair to an end shall be seen in the next few years.
</P>
<P>
This agreement replaces the previous one signed by President
Menem and the former Chilean President Patricio Aylwin in 1991,
which failed to be passed by the two parliaments due to the
opposition from certain sectors in the two countries.
</P>
<P>
Since 1984, when both countries signed a peace and friendship
agreement, different governments of both nations solved 23 of the
24 border century-long disputes, leaving only the zone of Campo de
Hielo Sur measuring about 2,300 square kilometers without
demarcation.

<HEADLINE> Indonesian Badminton Center May Get Overhaul </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, June 4 (Xinhua) -- Disappointed with the results of
the Sudirman Cup and Badminton World Championships, chairman of
the Badminton Association of Indonesia (PBSI) Subagyo Hadisiswoyo
has insisted on a total recondition of the National Training
Center.
</P>
<P>
Subagyo said that due to shuttlers poor form in both events in
Copenhagen last month the first thing to do was to have a thorough
evaluation.
</P>
<P>
Indonesia only reached the Sudirman Cup semifinals and none of
its players went through to the World Championships' semifinals.
The results were the worst in national badminton history since
both events started.
</P>
<P>
"We must know what are our weaknesses and our opponents
strengths. We must evaluate our development programs physically,
technically and mentally," Subagyo was quoted by The Jakarta Post
Friday as saying.
</P>
<P>
Subagyo said he has yet to see a strong fighting spirit among
athletes when they compete in important tournaments.
</P>
<P>
"They seemed very unsure of their skills and themselves. It's
not only about the spirit but also their self-confidence. Their
different backgrounds and physical appearances could give an
impact to their confidence," he said.
</P>
<P>
Subagyo, a four-star general and Army chief of staff, said PBSI
would also reshuffle coaches in the women's singles and doubles.
</P>
<P>
"The women's players, singles and doubles, will be handled by
male coaches. It's not because we think female coaches are unable
to do their jobs but we saw during the Sudirman Cup and World
Championships our women's shuttlers had bigger motivation.
Hopefully by having male coaches, they will train more intensively
and optimally," he said.
</P>
<P>
But, national training director Christian Hadinata declined to
give further details, saying that the details must wait until
Subagyo signs the decision letter.
</P>
<P>
"Wait until next week, hopefully we can release the new
coaches' names," he said.
</P>
<P>
PBSI official in charge of athletes development M.F. Siregar
said the women's coaches would likely help his division in talent
scouting and monitoring training.
</P>
<P>
"Now, our short-term target is not only to qualify for the
Olympics but also to win the golds," he said.
</P>
<P>
Another point to be improved is discipline in the dormitory.
Now, each room will accommodate two players, instead of one, to
improve communications among them and for efficiency.
</P>
<P>
"Athletes must attend morning and evening meetings everyday. If
they make mistakes, we must punish them in educative ways. For
instance, by ordering them to run several laps or give extra
practice time," Subagyo said.
</P>
<P>
Three athletes were punished after being caught returning home
in the morning. But Subagyo declined to name the athletes.
</P>
<P>
"Athletes must be taught to be responsible for their behavior.
If they show good behavior, we'll reward them, but if they are bad,
we must punish them", Subagyo said.
</P>
<P>
To support the training, PBSI has renovated the training hall,
focused more on the athletes' nutrition, including appointing a
new catering service, and has added to the training sessions.

SHENYANG, June 4 (Xinhua) -- Outpatient service for precocious
children was opened recently in this capital city of northeast

The development of sexual organs for girls less than eight
years and boys younger than 9.5 years is categorized as precocious,
which will in turn affect the body development and result in short
height.
</P>
<P>
Medical experts said that some precocious children can be cured
if their early sexual development is caused by excessive
assimilation of hormones. They also pointed out that causes for
precocity of 80 to 90 percent of the diseased girls and ten
percent of the ill boys still remain unclear.
</P>
<P>
The medical service offered by the Shenyang Children's Hospital
is designed to find out such unclear causes as soon as possible
and cure the disease with traditional Chinese herbal medicines.

LONDON, June 3 (Xinhua) -- Northern Ireland's First Minister
David Trimble said on Thursday the peace process was facing a
crisis which demanded that progress be made immediately.
</P>
<P>
In an interview with the Belfast Telegraph, Trimble, who leads

paramilitaries needed to begin decommissioning before unionists
could form an executive with Sinn Fein.
</P>
<P>
British Prime Minister Tony Blair has set a deadline of June 30

keep the province in line with devolution in Wales and Scotland.
</P>
<P>
"We could take the initial procedural steps towards creating an
executive," Trimble added.
</P>
<P>
The peace process has been deadlocked over the unionists'
refusal to form the 12-member executive with Sinn Fein until the
Irish Republican Army or IRA has begun decommissioning its
weapons.
</P>
<P>
But Sinn Fein insists decommissioning was not a condition to
establishing the executive under last year's Good Friday

<HEADLINE> Demonstration Held to Protest against NATO Bombing </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, June 3 (Xinhua) -- More than 200 U.S. citizens
staged a demonstration in front of the North Gate of the White
House here Thursday, calling on U.S. President Bill Clinton and
other leaders of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) to
immediately stop the airstrikes against Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
"Stop the bombing! Stop the killing! Stop the Suffering," the
participants shouted while trying to deliver a letter to Clinton
in the name of the National Coalition for Peace in Yugoslavia
(NCPY) newly formed by 27 U.S. national peace and religious
groups, including the American Friends Service Committee and the
Episcopal Peace Fellowship.
</P>
<P>
"We call for an immediate end to NATO bombing and intensified
effort to bring a just peace in Kosovo," the letter said. "An end
to the bombing is a prerequisite for any peace process to begin."
</P>
<P>
Some 20 demonstrators went down on their knees at the entrance
of the gate to request for meeting with Clinton, but the U.S.
president didn't appear. White House police arrested them on the
excuse of blocking the way and violating relevant law.
</P>
<P>
"This war violates the moral code of every religious tradition.
It is a war against the people of Serbia. It is a war that has
brought even greater harm and suffering to the people we claim we
are trying to save," said Bishop Thomas Gumbleton.
</P>
<P>
He said President Clinton and military leaders claim they
target only military installations in Yugoslavia, but it is a lie.
"I have seen the devastation and the suffering and the dying in
that country," he said.
</P>
<P>
An attack against innocent, unarmed people cannot be justified
by any religious law or any human law, he stressed.
</P>
<P>
Joe Volk, executive secretary of the Friends Committee on
National Legislation, one of the components of the NCPY, said the
NATO bombing of civilian infrastructure in Yugoslavia violates the
Rules of War and the Geneva Conventions. International law states
specifically that it is a war crime "to attack civilian targets or
to destroy or render useless objects indispensable to the survival
of the civilian population," he said.
</P>
<P>
"We urge President Clinton to halt the bombing of Yugoslavia
and pursue a negotiated settlement through the auspices of the
United Nations," Volk said.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the American Friends Service Committee, another NCPY
component, issued a statement, urging the NATO to swiftly end the
bombing on Yugoslavia in order to create the conditions for
negotiations and halt ongoing preparation for an invasion by
NATO ground troops.

<HEADLINE> World Bank Approves 69 Million Dollars for Albania </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, June 3 (Xinhua) -- The World Bank approved Thursday
45 million U.S. dollars for a Structural Adjustment Credit (SAC)
and a 24-million-dollar credit for the Second Irrigation and
Drainage Rehabilitation Project for Albania.
</P>
<P>
The Kosovo conflict and the sudden surge of refugees have placed
extraordinary demands on Albania's public sector to provide basic
infrastructure and public services, the bank said in a statement.
</P>
<P>
The SAC will support the government's efforts toward the
restoration of sustained growth and improved living standards
through reforms that enhance government functioning and also
strengthen the environment for more efficient private sector
development, the bank said.
</P>
<P>
The Second Irrigation and Drainage Rehabilitation Project will
achieve sustainable and equitable use of irrigation and water for
agriculture production and will reduce the risk of floods. It will
also support the government's initiative in taking the first steps
toward establishing an institutional framework for dam safety.
</P>
<P>
The two credits will be provided by the International
Development Association (IDA), the World Bank's concessionary
lending arm, and will be disbursed on standard IDA terms and
repayable in 40 years, including a 10-year grace period.

<HEADLINE> World Bank Approves Credit for Highway Project in Bolivia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, June 3 (Xinhua) -- The World Bank approved Thursday
a credit of 88 million U.S. dollars to help Bolivia improve the
transport conditions along a strategic north-south corridor
linking Beni, Santa Cruz, Chuquisaca.
</P>
<P>
By rehabilitating and improving the 152-kilometer Abapo-Camiri
section of the Trinidad-Yacuiba Corridor which is 1084 kilometers
long, the bank said, the project aims to lower transport costs,
foster the economic development of the area, improve the income
level of indigenous peoples in the project area, and establish
economic transport links between Bolivia and neighboring
countries.
</P>
<P>
The project will also introduce comprehensive maintenance by
contracting part of the national road network. When completed,
together with the west-east corridor between borders of Chile and
Brazil, this corridor would link the agricultural regions of Beni
and Cochabamba with Santa Cruz and all of them with export markets
in Argentina, Brazil and Paraguay, the bank said.
</P>
<P>
The project will remove constraints in transport and reduce
transport costs for goods and passengers. As a consequence,
traffic volumes in the highway are expected to increase by 80
percent, the average travel time between Abapo and Camiri will be
reduced by 3 hours, and transportation costs will be reduced by more
than 25 percent.
</P>
<P>
The credit will be provided by the International Development
Association (IDA), the World Bank's concessionary lending arm, and
will be disbursed on standard IDA terms and repayable in 40 years,
including a 10-year grace period.

<HEADLINE> Dow Moves Higher On Wall Street </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>

<P>
NEW YORK, June 3 (Xinhua) -- The Dow Jones industrial
average moved higher Thursday as investors were eased about
higher inflation and interest rates after a release on slow
orders for manufactured goods in April.
</P>
<P>
The Dow closed up 85.80 at 10,663.69. The index lost 18.37
points Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The Commerce Department reported that orders to American
factories for manufactured goods fell 1.2 percent in April,
indicating a slowdown for the economy. The Federal Reserve warned
more than two weeks ago that it would raise interest rates to
cool off the economy if inflation is building up.
</P>
<P>
A separate report on a slight rise in number of Americans
filing new claims for unemployment benefits helped encouraged
the market. But Investors were waiting a report on unemployment
data Friday because the wage component of the report will offer
a more indication of whether the U.S. economy is under
inflationary pressures.
</P>
<P>
Big sales at the nation's largest retailers in May
turned investors to a broad-based range of stocks.
</P>
<P>
Broader stock indicators were mixed. The Standard &AMP; Poor's
500 index rose 4.73 at 1,299.54 while the technology heavy
Nasdaq composite index fell 29.09 at 2,403.32.
</P>
<P>
The NYSE composite index rose 3.70 at 624.20 and the
American Stock Exchange index rose 4.71 at 775.94. The Russell
2000 index of smaller companies fell 0.76 at 435.98.
</P>
<P>
Advancing issues outnumbered decliners by a 6-to-5 margin on
the New York Stock Exchange, with 1,615 up, 1,324 down and 614
unchanged.
</P>
<P>
NYSE volume increased slightly to 716.15 million from 716.14
million in the previous session.

<HEADLINE> Kosovo Peace Prospect Lifts European Markets </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, June 3 (Xinhua) -- European markets closed comfortably
in the black Thursday, as investors took heart from indications of
a peace settlement in Kosovo and a positive start on Wall Street.
</P>
<P>
UK's FTSE-100 index traded higher all day, finishing up 46.4
points, or 0.7 percent, at 6438.6. Provisional volume was 818.8m

</P>
<P>
Stock gains from the prospect of peace in Kosovo were limited,
however, as investors held back from the market ahead of the
release Friday of key U.S. employment data.
</P>
<P>
The cautious mood was reflected by the small gains made by blue
chips on the pan-European FTSE Eurotop 300. The index closed up
11.43 points to 1295.62, a rise of 0.89 percent.

ROME, June 3 (Xinhua) -- U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan said
here Thursday that the Yugoslav Parliament's approval of the
Kosovo peace agreement was a "big" step ahead, adding that it was
premature to "leap with joy".
</P>

Annan said that he wants to speak with the EU's envoy for the
Balkans, Finnish President Martti Ahtisaari, before drawing any
conclusions as moves at the U.N. Security Council on the Kosovo
crisis.

Annan is here at Pope John Paul II's invitation for talks on
the crisis, and he also made a courtesy visit to Italian President
Carlo Azeglio Ciampi before seeing the Catholic leader at the
Vatican.

According to the head of the U.N. office in Italy, Staffan De
Mistura, Annan was informed of the Serbian parliament's vote

<HEADLINE> EU Passes Employment Pact </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Cologne, Germany, June 3 (Xinhua) -- In their endeavor to fight
with Europe's high jobless rate, the 15 state and government
chiefs of the European Union (EU) members on Thursday at their
Cologne summit passed an employment pact, which is obviously short
of new receipt.
</P>
<P>
Top goal of the initiative is to secure job opportunities by
strong economic growth without inflation, said the pact. Aiming at
that, the pact called for regular talking on loans, financial and
monetary policies among European financial ministers, social
partners and the European Central Bank (ECB).
</P>
<P>
France and some other EU members, after failing to add a
quantitative employment standard into the pact, called on the EU
to set a goal of economic growth at 3 percent. But the growth rate
is what a depressive German economy can hardly achieve.
</P>
<P>
Under the pact, only a moderate amount of funds, about 500
million euros (515 million dollars), are to be made available for
helping to generating new jobs.

<HEADLINE> More Blacks Unhappy with Police Than Whites in U.S. </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, June 3 (Xinhua) -- Twenty-four percent of blacks
were unhappy with police while only 10 percent of whites
expressed dissatisfaction in a 1998 survey in 12 U.S. cities,
the U.S. Justice Department said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
"There's still too great a gulf between the views of the
minority community and white residents," said Deputy Attorney
General Eric Holder.
</P>
<P>
Attorney General Janet Reno and Holder will hold a meeting
with civil rights leaders and top police officials next week to
consider complaints about police misconduct involving minorities.
</P>
<P>
"Next week's conference is aimed at exploring ways to break
the barriers of misunderstanding and distrust that are still far
too common among many of our nation's police agencies and the
residents," Holder said.
</P>
<P>
Though the blacks are legally equal with the whites in the
United States, many blacks still feel they are treated differently
in daily life and racism is still prevailing in the country.
</P>
<P>
Allegations of racial bias among police got common in New
York after officers earlier this year shot dead unarmed black
immigrant Amadou Diallo.
</P>
<P>
Four New York City police officers are on trial in the beating
and sexual torture of Haitian immigrant Abner Louima.

<HEADLINE> Clinton Decides to Extend Normal Trade Relations </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, June 3 (Xinhua) -- U.S. President Bill Clinton
declared here on Thursday that he had decided to extend Normal
Trade Relations(NTR) to China, and he called on the Congress to
support such a decision which he described as "good for Americans"
and beneficial for U.S. economy and security.
</P>
<P>
Clinton, in a written statement, said that U.S. exports to
China have quadrupled over the past decade, and exports to China
and Hong Kong support some 400,000 American jobs.
</P>
<P>
"Revoking NTR would derail ongoing negotiations to increase our
access to China's market and to promote economic reforms there,"
he said.
</P>
<P>
In addition, Clinton expressed his determination to seek an
agreement for China to join the World Trade Organization(WTO) "on
viable commercial terms".
</P>
<P>
He also promised to work closely with Congress "to secure
permanent NTR status for China in the context of a commercially
strong WTO agreement".
</P>
<P>
In the statement, Clinton vowed to continue his policy of
engagement with China,despite mounting pressures among some
republican Congressmen for a detour from the White House set
policy following the release of Cox report.
</P>
<P>
China has denounced the Cox report, which charged Beijing with
"stealing U.S. nuclear secrets", as "full of fabrications" with an
aim to stir up anti-Chinese sentiments among the American public
and to divert world-wide condemnations on the U.S.-led bombing of
the Chinese embassy in Belgrade.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Joe Lockhart, Spokesman for the White House, said on
Thursday that it is very much in the interest of American
business, workers, families to have normal trading relations with
China.
</P>
<P>
"I think it's also in the interests of our policy of engagement
because we think trade fosters openness, reform, which is all --
all benefits to the positive," he said.
</P>
<P>
Billing the current atmosphere on Capitol Hill as "somewhat
more charged", Lockhart however said that he believed the Congress
will ultimately treat the extension of NTR to China as a trade
issue. "I think that we'll get a positive result," he added.
