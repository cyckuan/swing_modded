 &HT;    Senator seeks to heal wounds inflicted by challenge to Bush
 &HT;    
 &HT;    
 &HT;    
 &HT;    By GREG McDONALD
 &HT;    c.2000 Houston Chronicle
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHILADELPHIA _ Sen. John McCain finally exited the presidential
campaign stage Tuesday night, delivering a ringing endorsement of
George W. Bush for the Republican nomination and steering clear of
the campaign finance reform issues that catapulted the Arizona
senator to political prominence.
</P>
<P>
   In the closing speech on the second day of the Republican
National Convention, the senator sought to heal the wounds
inflicted on the party by his primary challenge to Bush. Sounding a
note of harmony, he called on his GOP colleagues to ``build a party
as big as the country we serve.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I am grateful for your kindness to a distant runner-up,'' the
senator said to cheers and long applause. ``I am proud to join you
this evening in commending to all Americans the man who now
represents your best wishes and mine for the future of our
country.''
</P>
<P>
   The rousing reception was in stark contrast to the groans of
protest that greeted the senator on Sunday when he officially
released his committed delegates and called on them to back the
Texas governor with the same kind of feverish devotion they had
bestowed on him.
</P>
<P>
   But there were some tears shed among his supporters Tuesday
night for what might have been had McCain's maverick bid for the
presidency upset the well financed Bush juggernaut.
</P>
<P>
   Many of the senator's supporters seemed upset that their hero
spoke not as a reform advocate but as Bush's vanquished foe, bowing
before him to offer the lavish endorsement.
</P>
<P>
   They had expected a strongly worded endorsement, since the
senator is still, after all, a loyal Republican. But they had hoped
for the same kind of rousing reform-pushing message that helped
McCain attract so many independents and crossover Democrats in the
primary races and that alienated so many in the GOP establishment.
</P>
<P>
   Robert A. Watson, a strident McCain supporter and the minority
leader of the Rhode Island House of Representatives, described the
speech as ``a bittersweet moment'' signaling finality to McCain's
quest for the presidency.
</P>
<P>
   He said he would have preferred that the former Vietnam prisoner
of war at least touch on the issue of campaign finance reform, but
he added that he understood why he didn't.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not surprised, because John McCain is a bridge-builder.
He's using his appearance to support and unite the party,'' Watson
said. ``This is George Bush's convention, and John McCain is a
loyal Republican.''
</P>
<P>
   In his speech, McCain made a point of calling on independents
and Democrats to join in the effort to elect Bush, who, he said,
``believes in the greatness of America and the justice of our
cause.''
</P>
<P>
   But absent was any direct reference to the government reform
issues that drew 7 million voters to his campaign.
</P>
<P>
   Republicans fear that many of those voters will not support the
GOP ticket in November with the senator out of the race. But Watson
predicted that enough would shift their support to Bush to make the
difference in the election outcome.
</P>
<P>
   ``John McCain brought a lot of independents and Democrats to the
party. That's his legacy, the new faces and the new blood,'' Watson
said. ``And for him to try to transfer their support to George
Bush, that's a very gracious and proper thing for him to do.''
</P>
<P>
   Throughout his campaign, McCain talked about the greatness of
American and how its strength is built on a ``cause greater than
self-interest.'' He returned to that theme in his endorsement of
the man he once described as a ``phony reformer'' and a status-quo
Republican whose close ties to the right wing elements of the party
would be divisive to the country.
</P>
<P>
   This time, however, the man who a few months ago was not
qualified to be president in McCain's view, had become a healer
instead of a divider.
</P>
<P>
   ``He wants nothing to divide us into separate nations. Not
color. Not our race. Not our wealth. Not our religion. Not our
politics. He wants us to live for American as one nation,'' the
senator said, to heavy applause.
</P>
<P>
   ``I support him. I am grateful to him. And I am proud of him.'' &QL;

<P>
   PHILADELPHIA _ Sen. John McCain shed his rebellious image to
play the admiring party stalwart at the Republican National
Convention Tuesday night, commending Gov. George W. Bush to
independents and Democrats and _ addressing one of the governor's
most pronounced vulnerabilities _ saying he would ably defend the
nation's interests abroad.
</P>
<P>
   ``I support him,'' McCain said in his prepared remarks, trying
to erase tensions from a primary battle that had been so raw that
McCain waited two months to reluctantly endorse Bush. ``I am
grateful to him. And I am proud of him.''
</P>
<P>
   McCain's speech anchored an evening whose overarching objective
was to assemble several faces, old and new, to assure the national
viewing audience that Bush could be trusted on the international
stage despite his failure to serve in Vietnam and the fact that, by
his own admission, his foreign policy experience does not stretch
beyond Mexico.
</P>
<P>
   Joining the chorus in the other high-profile speech was
Condoleezza Rice, Bush's chief international affairs adviser who,
as an African American, also underscores Bush's pledge to put
minorities in consequential roles.
</P>
<P>
   ``The George W. Bush I know is a man of uncommonly good
judgment,'' Rice, a national security council official in former
President Bush's administration, said in her prepared remarks. ``He
is focused and consistent. He believes that we Americans are at our
best when we exercise power without fanfare or arrogance. He speaks
plainly and with a positive spirit.''
</P>
<P>
   The speeches were testimonials to the personal ability McCain,
Rice and the other speakers perceived in Bush, but offered little
on specific policies or countries.
</P>
<P>
   Besides trying to shore up Bush's record, a cavalcade of
speakers reminded the public of Republican presidents like Ronald
Reagan and George Bush who were known for eliciting respect for
America abroad and for their emphasis on national security.
</P>
<P>
   Retired Gen. Norman Schwarzkopf, commander of allied forces in
the Persian Gulf war, appeared via satellite from a battleship,
reminding the convention that ``10 years ago tomorrow, Iraq invaded
Kuwait.'' He asked: ``Wouldn't it be great for our armed forces,
and for America, if we could have another commander in chief named
George Bush?''
</P>
<P>
   Bob Dole, the Republican nominee four years ago who was wounded
in World War II, asked the audience to ``join me in saluting the
greatest generation of veterans and every generation of our armed
services.''
</P>
<P>
   Elizabeth Dole, who had a starring role at the convention in
1996 when she spoke reverentially of her husband, said that
``timeless values form our first line of defense.'' Bush, she said,
``will put an end to the smash-mouth politics of recent years and
to the name-calling that tarnishes our trust and alienates so many
real people whose real problems can never be solved in a focus
group or soothed by a spin doctor.''
</P>
<P>
   To drive home the theme of military might, there was a video
tribute to World War II veterans and a musical medley of military
service anthems.
</P>
<P>
   Bush's popularity afforded him the freedom to play to a broader
audience outside the hall by giving a speaking slot (albeit not in
prime time) to an openly gay congressman, Rep. Jim Kolbe of
Arizona, who spoke about international trade.
</P>
<P>
   During his remarks, several members of the Texas delegation
protested by taking off their cowboy hats and bowing their heads in
prayer. Most of the delegates were respectful but offered Kolbe
only weak applause.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're not all the way there with our party,'' Kolbe, speaking
of his party's policy toward homosexuals, said on ``Political
Points,'' the Webcast of The New York Times and ABC News. ``The
Democratic Party isn't all the way there yet either in terms of its
treatment of minorities and other groups.''
</P>
<P>
   So concerted was the outreach to Democrats from the stage here
that the convention played a videotape featuring the words of
Franklin Delano Roosevelt.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the gauzy, smiling images of moderation from the stage,
there were stirrings of resentment among some conservatives who
voiced concerns that the convention did not truly reflect their
views. At a crowded Christian Coalition rally at a downtown hotel,
delegates seemed thrilled to hear some of the conservative, red
meat rhetoric missing from the convention hall.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know this is a convention of sweetness and light,'' Pat
Robertson, the coalition's founder, declared to the crowd. ``Nobody
wants to rock the boat.''
</P>
<P>
   Mike St. Clair, a delegate from Ankeny, Iowa, complained that
the party was not putting forth enough contrast with the Democrats.
``There must be some contrast, otherwise it is hard for people to
become passionate,'' he said. ``You have to be able to see the
differences between the parties.''
</P>
<P>
   Just before 9 p.m., delegates rose in applause to a tableau
representing every living Republican president: Gerald Ford and his
wife, Betty, and Nancy Reagan joined former President and Mrs.
Barbara Bush in the prime viewing seats overlooking the convention.
Mrs. Dole also sat with them.
</P>
<P>
   In the midst of the video tributes to Ford, the audience broke
out in applause at the mention of Mrs. Ford's hospitalization for
breast cancer _ and then, across the convention hall, rose to their
feets. Mr. and Mrs. Ford waved back in thanks.
</P>
<P>
   Then one of the most popular figures in Republican politics,
Barbara Bush, appeared unnannounced and greeted the crowd: ``I hope
that I am the first person to welcome you to Philadelphia: the city
of motherly love.''
</P>
<P>
   She then introduced her son, who appeared before the convention
by a satellite hookup for the second night in a row. This time, the
location was Gettysburg, Pa., where Abraham Lincoln delivered a
famous speech and where general-turned-president Dwight Eisenhower
once lived. Governor Bush praised McCain, saying, ``His straight
talk and strong convictions are admired across America.''
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   But the evening was clearly dominated by McCain. The Bush
campaign's decision to give a vanquished rival such a prominent
role on the second night of the convention marked a striking
departure from the last several Republican conventions. At the
convention four years ago, the prized Tuesday night slot was given
to then Rep. Susan Molinari, who had been one of Dole's most loyal
backers.
</P>
<P>
   The Bush campaign's decision to give McCain such a high profile
underscored not only that McCain has emerged as an influential
force in his party but also that Bush is so popular among
Republicans that he does not have to worry that McCain would draw
too much attention.
</P>
<P>
   For his part, McCain clearly recognized that there was no
political upside to stirring up trouble for the Texas governor and
that he could score points by playing the loyal trooper.
Strikingly, he was so determined to fall in line behind Bush that
he did not even raise his signature issue of campaign finance
reform, something he relentlessly brings up every chance he gets.
He even played down his achievement of winning the New Hampshire
and Michigan primaries, calling himself ``a distant runner-up.''
</P>
<P>
   But his comments Tuesday night led some of McCain's most ardent
backers to privately grouse that he was being too adulatory, and
abandoning his greatest attribute _ his maverick nature.
</P>
<P>
   McCain, who drew a potent following from independents and
Democrats during the primaries, implored his followers to rally
behind Bush.
</P>
<P>
   ``I say to all Americans, Republican, Democrat or independent,''
he asserted, ``if you believe America deserves leaders with a
purpose more ennobling than expediency and opportunism, then vote
for Governor Bush. If you believe patriotism is more than a
soundbite and public service should be more than a photo-op, then
vote for Governor Bush.''
</P>
<P>
   Former Sen. Alan K. Simpson of Wyoming said McCain knew it was
not in his interest to be a political menace at the convention.
``He has a great future with the party,'' Simpson said. ``You never
want to be known as a poor loser. He wants to be loved like all of
us. He wants to be a player.''
</P>
<P>
   While the speakers touched on a panoply of foreign-policy
issues, the matters left unaddressed were telling. For example,
despite Schwarzkopf's praise of former President Bush for leading
the coalition to victory in the Persian Gulf, American warplanes
are still bombing Iraq and President Saddam Hussein is as firmly
entrenched as ever.
</P>
<P>
   Rice said that Governor Bush would never allow the United States
to be blackmailed by outlaw states, and urged swift construction of
a national missile defense to safeguard against missile strikes.
But she laid out no new plan to defend against stateless terrorists
who might use the much cheaper and equally deadly alternative of a
truck bomb attack.
</P>
<P>
   In her speech, Rice depicted Governor Bush as a bilingual
internationalist, meeting with leaders from Mexico, Russia and
South Africa. But, in fact, many of the meetings were little more
than handshakes and hellos. President Thabo Mleki of South Africa
called his visit to the governor's mansion in May a ``courtesy
call.''
</P>
<P>
   While in Washington in April, Bush met briefly in his hotel with
Russian Foreign Minister Igor Ivanov to discuss Chechnya and the
Anti-Ballistic Missile Treaty. Beforehand, Bush told reporters he
was looking forward to meeting ``Iggy.''
</P>
<P>
   In a notable contrast to the play for moderates from the hall,
Pat Robertson, at the Christian Coalition gathering earlier in the
day, delivered a rousing speech about the stakes in this election
for religious conservatives, focusing on the Supreme Court. ``Five
people can decide the destiny of unborn children,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``It looks as if two or three of those unelected officials are
getting ready to retire or go on up to that great court in the sky.
The next president is going to have the ability to select two or
three judges on the Supreme Court,'' he added, to cheers and
applause. ``We need to have the election of a man who will appoint
righteous judges to the court of the United States.''
</P>
<P>
   He added: ``I frankly agree with Ronald Reagan. I think we
should do away with the federal Department of Education.'' This, of
course, put him distinctly at odds with Bush, who fought hard
against that position in the platform process _ and prevailed.

 &HT;    Backs Bush on military issue
 &HT;    
 &HT;    
 &HT;    By BENNETT ROTH
 &HT;    c. 2000 Houston Chronicle
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHILADELPHIA _ Seeking to underscore their commitment to
military might, Republicans Tuesday turned to Sen. John McCain, the
Vietnam War hero who waged a ferocious primary battle against
George W. Bush earlier this year.
</P>
<P>
   McCain's speech capped an evening devoted to projecting the
notion that Bush, who has been criticized for his limited foreign
policy experience, would restore the nation's military strength and
respect around the world.
</P>
<P>
   Although he bitterly criticized Bush during the primary
campaign, McCain lavished praise on the Texas governor during the
prime time speech. The Arizona senator did not mention the
signature issue of his failed presidential bid, curbing the
influence of money in politics.
</P>
<P>
   Speaking more to the Republican faithful than the independent
voters who helped propel his campaign, McCain pledged to be the
loyal party soldier, noting that his grandfather had commanded
President Bush in the Pacific during World War II.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now it is my turn to serve under the son of my grandfather's
brave subordinate,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   While Republicans had hoped to run a glitch-free convention,
they encountered several obstacles on their second day.
</P>
<P>
   A few hours before delegates were to begin arriving at the
convention center, demonstrations turned violent, as protesters
blocked traffic, slashed police tires and dumped orange paint on
police vehicles in downtown Philadelphia. More than 200 people were
arrested.
</P>
<P>
   Although the clashes occurred several miles from the First Union
Center, the traffic tie-ups hindered many delegates' efforts to get
from their downtown hotels to the arena in south Philadelphia.
</P>
<P>
   Inside the convention hall, the tensions between conservatives
and moderates over social issues _ largely hidden from public view
this year _ surfaced again during a speech by Rep. Jim Kolbe,
R-Ariz., the only openly gay GOP member of the House.
</P>
<P>
   Disturbed by the prominent role given a man whose sexual
orientation they disapprove of, members of the Texas delegation
discussed walking out on Kolbe. Instead, they decided to pray
silently during his speech.
</P>
<P>
   Kolbe made no references to his personal life in the speech,
which mostly praised Bush's support of free trade.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Bush, who spoke at rallies in West Virginia and
Harrisburg, Pa., briefly broke his vow to run a positive campaign
as he responded to several days of criticism from President
Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   ``He is so desperate to have his legacy intact by getting Al
Gore elected, he'll say anything, just like Al Gore,'' Bush told
reporters.
</P>
<P>
   In a television interview, former President Bush also threatened
to drop his self-imposed silence and join in GOP criticism of
Clinton if he continues taunting the Texas governor.
</P>
<P>
   George W. Bush's convention organizers, knowing he and
vice-presidential choice, Dick Cheney, never personally saw combat,
provided a lineup of decorated war heroes to stress GOP support for
improving military readiness and developing a missile defense
system.
</P>
<P>
   In a reminder of the military high point of President Bush's
administration, the delegates heard from retired Gen. Norman
Schwarzkopf, who commanded allied forces during the Persian Gulf
War. Schwarzkopf's criticism of the Clinton administration's
defense policies were beamed to the convention hall by satellite
from the deck of the USS New Jersey, which was docked across the
Delaware River.
</P>
<P>
   Schwarzkopf decried the shrinking of the three branches of the
military and the fall-off in service enlistments since President
Bush left office. ``Wouldn't it be great for our armed forces and
for America if we could have another commander in chief named
George Bush with Dick Cheney on his team?'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   In another nod to the past, former Sen. Bob Dole, who was
wounded in World War II and who waged an unsuccessful presidential
bid against Clinton four years ago, offered a tribute to his aging
generation of soldiers.
</P>
<P>
   Taking a swipe at the man who beat him in 1996, Dole told
delegates, ``We look to Governor Bush and Secretary Cheney to raise
our sights and to restore honor and civility to our public life.''
</P>
<P>
   The delegates also heard from Dole's wife, Elizabeth Dole, who
made an unsuccessful primary bid for the White House last year. She
said Bush ``would put an end to smash-mouth politics of recent
years and to the name-calling that tarnishes our trust and
alienates so many real people whose real problems can never be
solved in a focus group or soothed by a spin-doctor.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush also addressed the delegates by satellite from Gettysburg,
where he was staying at the retirement home of former President
Eisenhower. ``Morale in the military is dangerously low,'' he said.
``The men and women in uniform need better pay and better
training.''
</P>
<P>
   The convention's Tuesday night session also showcased one of the
governor's top foreign policy experts, Condoleezza Rice, a former
Stanford University provost. She told the delegates that ``George
W. Bush will never allow America to be blackmailed.''
</P>
<P>
   Trying to deflect questions about Bush's readiness to deal with
world leaders, Rice said she has witnessed him explaining issues to
Mexico's leaders, Russia's foreign minister and South Africa's
president.
</P>
<P>
   She told delegates that her father became a Republican in
Alabama in 1952 because Democrats in his native Alabama would not
register him to vote because he was black.
</P>
<P>
   Hoping to mute criticism of Bush's environmental record in
Texas, Republicans awarded a prime speaking spot to Theodore
Roosevelt IV, an environmentalist and great-grandson of former
President Theodore Roosevelt, who helped create the national park
system.
</P>
<P>
   However, Roosevelt never mentioned Bush's name or his Texas
record, instead noting that other Republicans _ including former
President Richard Nixon and New York Gov. George Pataki _ had
championed environmental causes.
</P>
<P>
   Although Republicans devoted a portion of the evening to
addressing international affairs, polls show that the issue does
not move many voters.
</P>
<P>
   A Voter.com Battleground 2000 tracking poll released Tuesday
found that 2 percent of likely voters rank foreign affairs as the
most important issue on the next president's agenda. The
respondents put a higher priority on improving education, restoring
moral values and expanding health care.
</P>
<P>
   Ed Goeas, a Republican pollster who co-directs the poll, said
that while voters do not view foreign policy as their most
important priority they become concerned when presidents cannot
deal with their domestic needs because they distracted by
international problems.
</P>
<P>
   The poll found Bush leading Gore, 47-41, among likely voters, a
slight tightening of the race from six weeks ago when the vice
president trailed Bush by 12 points.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Gore mulled his vice-presidential pick as he
vacationed in North Carolina, and Democrats kept a steady drumbeat
of criticism toward the GOP.
</P>
<P>
   At news conference in Philadelphia, Rep. Sheila Jackson Lee of
Houston joined several other politicians criticizing Bush's record
on race relations and his ties to the firearms industry.
</P>
<P>
   Jackson Lee disputed Republican claims that their session Monday
night, filled with a parade of minority speakers, was an
improvement on their past conventions. ``It may be progress in the
Republican Party, but it is not progress in America,'' she said.

CATALOG GIVES MEDIA SLICK LOOK AT L.A. &HT;    (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By ALEXA HAUSSLER 
c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News 
<TEXT>
 &LR;
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Democratic National Convention organizers have
borrowed a page from the TV show ``Spin City'' in selling what a
really great place Los Angeles is to the media army due in town for
the big event. Really.
</P>
<P>
   Glossing over smog, scandal and stalled traffic, the 114-page,
glossy book titled ``Capital City of the 21st Century'' provides
glowing anecdotes and factoids _ plus listings of restaurants and
attractions.
</P>
<P>
   Paid for with corporate and city donations, the book was sent by
the convention's host committee to all 15,000 members of the media
who are expected to cover the Aug. 14-17 convention at Staples
Center.
</P>
<P>
   ``No longer will members of the media be treated to free bottles
of Visine, as they were at the 1960 Democratic National Convention
because of poor air quality,'' the guide explains. ``Today,
visitors to Los Angeles will be treated to breathtaking views
through the clearest air in decades.''
</P>
<P>
   True enough, but hardly crystal clear as the city vies with
Houston for the trophy for the nation's dirtiest air.
</P>
<P>
   The booklet offers members of the media a guide to everything
including where to eat sushi in Hollywood (Yamashiro on North
Sycamore Avenue) and pastrami in Northridge (Brent's Deli on
Parthenia Street).
</P>
<P>
   Actually, Brent's is listed on (italics) Panthenia (italics
off). But if members of the national media make it all the way to
the North Valley for a deli sandwich, they can probably get correct
directions to Brent's.
</P>
<P>
   The guide also lists attractions from the Watts Tower to the
Getty Museum to CBS' Television City.
</P>
<P>
   That might seem like a long drive for journalists. Not to worry,
the guide says: The city has ``highly effective, well-designed and
integrated transportation networks that enable Angelenos to move
smoothly through the city.''
</P>
<P>
   Smoothly, if they stay away from gridlocked streets and freeways
and stick to the subway, which is often ridiculed as the ``Subway
to Nowhere.''
</P>
<P>
   Officials from the Los Angeles Host Committee said the guide _
which dozens of public relations experts worked on for 10 months _
is designed to take advantage of the city's ``15 minutes in the
national spotlight.''
</P>
<P>
   ``All of this is about telling the story of Los Angeles to the
national media,'' said Ben Austin, spokesman for the Los Angeles
host committee.
</P>
<P>
   Despite its rosy tone, the book isn't all safe streets and clean
air. It does refer _ briefly and vaguely _ to the Rampart police
corruption scandal and the Los Angeles Unified School District's
bungled attempt to build the nation's costliest school, the Belmont
Learning Center, on a toxic site.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Los Angeles Police Department has experienced tough
situations in recent years but remains one of our nation's most
disciplined, effective, and respected law enforcement
organizations,'' the book boasts.
</P>
<P>
   It never actually mentions the words Rampart Division _ the LAPD
station-house name that has come to represent the department's
biggest scandal and which has city officials trying to thwart a
department takeover by the U.S. Justice Department.
</P>
<P>
   The cost of printing the book exceeded $50,000, which was
donated by the city Department of Water and Power, host committee
officials said. Other funds come from corporations whose logos are
on the front cover.
</P>
<P>
   Scores of volunteers also helped assemble, write and mail the
book to the thousands of media representatives expected to come to
Los Angeles in two weeks.
</P>
<P>
   Planners admit that they wanted to put the most positive spin
possible on the book.
</P>
<P>
   ``Most people know about Los Angeles, but some people know about
Los Angeles for the wrong reasons, because of riots and natural
disasters and a severe economic recession,'' Austin said.
</P>
<P>
   The committee wanted to offer a different story, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``The mere fact that we are hosting this convention, that we
were chosen and that we were ready to step into the national
spotlight says so much about how far our community has come in such
a short time,'' Austin said.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's the story that we are looking to tell the world.''

SURF IS SWELL, RIDERS SAY &HT;    (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JASON KANDEL 
c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News 
<TEXT>
 &LR;
<P>
   MALIBU, Calif. _ For Roger Kelly, work wasn't going to get in
the way of an opportunity to catch a ride on perhaps the best surf
of the summer at Surfrider Beach.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm playing a little hooky right now,'' said the 51-year-old
financial adviser for American Express as he waxed his board
Tuesday. ``I'm taking advantage of the big day. This is one of the
biggest days of the year.''
</P>
<P>
   He was among hundreds of surfers who took the day off from work
to catch a wave, as high surf and unusually high tides from a
southern Pacific storm caused relatively minor damage and
positively major excitement.
</P>
<P>
   Weather officials recorded a high tide of 4.8 feet at 11:36 a.m.
Tuesday and a 6.6-foot high tide was expected to hit by 11 p.m.
Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   The high tides and big waves were triggered by a storm in the
South Pacific that sent a surge toward Los Angeles, and were
expected to continue through Thursday, said Bruce Rockwell, a
meteorologist with the National Weather Service.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is the biggest so far this summer,'' Rockwell said. ``I
don't recommend any novice swimmer going anywhere near the water.''
</P>
<P>
   Lifeguards in Malibu reported 14-foot waves, with some licking
coastal homes.
</P>
<P>
   The storm surge damaged two houses in the exclusive Malibu
Colony, prompting fire officials to evacuate the affected homes,
move furniture and shut off utilities late Monday.
</P>
<P>
   By Tuesday, with the firefighters gone, but on standby,
residents tallied their losses. One family lost a wood deck to the
ocean, another lost part of a deck, said fire Inspector Ed Martinez
of the Los Angeles County Fire Department.
</P>
<P>
   ``If there are problems with high tides again, we do have
sandbags available,'' Martinez said.
</P>
<P>
   Besides sending big breakers crashing on the shore, high surf
and riptides kept lifeguards on alert.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had a lot of near misses today, but we kept everybody
intact, no injuries,'' said county lifeguard Norton Wisdom, 53, who
was stationed at Surfrider Beach this week. ``We have a lot of
novice and intermediate surfers out there. This is the biggest surf
it's been in five years. There's so many people out there that
sometimes there's arguments. Most are verbal.''
</P>
<P>
   One of the most daring rescues Monday involved a boy who became
trapped in his life jacket and was forced underwater while he and
his father were kayaking in the area. No one was injured.
</P>
<P>
   The high surf, coupled with water temperatures in the 60s and
air temperatures in the 70s, also attracted unusually high numbers
of people to Malibu on Tuesday. At any one time, more than 100
surfers could be seen maneuvering in for a ride on a wave.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was real crowded,'' said Internet company owner and Malibu
native Andy DangVu, 28, sitting on the beach near his board with a
towel over his head, seeking refuge from the sun. ``There are a lot
of kooks out there coming out of the woodwork.''
</P>
<P>
   The sun glistened off glassy waves Tuesday morning as the high
tide swept the water closer to the shore. Some saw the high tide as
a blessing, others a curse.
</P>
<P>
   After a three-hour dip in the ocean, lifetime surfer and former
lifeguard John Baker, 53, was impressed.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is phenomenal,'' he said. ``Each wave looks like it could
be on the cover of a magazine. It's a consistent swell, and
sometimes you manage to get a wave to yourself. I had about three
or four really good rides to myself today.''
</P>
<P>
   DangVu, on the other hand, decided to wait out the high tide.
</P>
<P>
   ``The high tides are pushing the waves a little too far out,''
he said. ``The waves are too mushy.''

KLINE WINS NOMINATION IN THREE-WAY GOP RACE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JIM SULLINGER  
 c. 2000 Kansas City Star   KANSAS CITY, Mo. _ State Rep. Phill
Kline defeated two Republican rivals Tuesday to claim the party's
nomination in Kansas' 3rd Congressional District and the right to
take on incumbent Democrat Dennis Moore this fall.
<TEXT>
<P>
   After a hard-fought primary campaign, voters were giving the
conservative state lawmaker from Shawnee, Kan., 50 percent of the
vote, compared to 38 percent for Overland Park, Kan., City Council
member Greg Musil and 12 percent for Olathe physician Gary Morsch.
</P>
<P>
   Those results represented 81 percent of the precincts reporting.
</P>
<P>
   The Kline-Moore matchup will be one of a handful of
congressional races watched by party leaders and political
observers around the nation. With only a five-vote margin for
Republicans in the U.S. House, close races will be assigned even
greater importance this year.
</P>
<P>
   ``I called Phill and congratulated him on a good race and told
him I'm looking forward to a good campaign,'' Moore said Tuesday
night. ``I think it's going to be a fun campaign. There's going to
be a clear contrast between Phill Kline and myself.''
</P>
<P>
   Kline won Wyandotte and Miami counties decisively and received
more votes than Musil in Douglas County. In vote-rich Johnson
County, Kline garnered 48.9 percent of the vote, compared to 39
percent for Musil and 12 percent for Morsch.
</P>
<P>
   Kline's campaign was built on three objectives _ raising enough
money to stay competitive with Musil, building a large grass-roots
organization and staying focused on his message of tax relief and
local control of education.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were able to meet our goals and carry out our strategy,''
said John Kerr, Kline's campaign manager. ``We felt that if we did
that, we'd win.''
</P>
<P>
   Kline began the race with a large advantage in voter
recognition. Because of that, he was tabbed early as the
front-runner.
</P>
<P>
   He never relinquished that position.
</P>
<P>
   The Musil and Morsch camps conceded that Kline began the
campaign as the best-known candidate. He also started with a huge
base of support among the party's conservative wing.
</P>
<P>
   He was endorsed by Kansans for Life, an anti-abortion group, and
the Kansas Republican Assembly, the party's conservative faction.
But Kerr said the campaign also reached out to moderates who liked
Kline's history of backing tax cuts.
</P>
<P>
   Musil's strategy was to appeal to social moderates with the
evolution issue. In weeks of television ads, Musil called the state
Board of Education's decision on science standards last year an
``embarrassment to Kansas.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We knew we were behind,'' said David Schlosser, Musil's
campaign manager. ``We had to make up the difference and get
ahead.''
</P>
<P>
   The campaign had to develop a message that would motivate people
to go to the polls and give Musil an identity with voters that was
different from Kline's and Morsch's. It was determined early in the
campaign that evolution and the Shawnee Mission School District's
financial problems were issues that Musil could exploit.
</P>
<P>
   The Overland Park councilman raised more money than the two
other candidates but not the $650,000 he had hoped. In the closing
days of the drive, Musil lent his campaign $50,000. The last two
weeks of the campaign, he spent about $100,000 to get his
pro-evolution message on Kansas City television stations.
</P>
<P>
   Schlosser said evolution was considered a better issue than
taxes, for example.
</P>
<P>
   ``That (the tax issue) meets Phill on his own ground,''
Schlosser said. ``That wasn't the best territory to wage the
battle.''
</P>
<P>
   Geographically, Musil's campaign had hoped to do well in older
areas of Johnson County, especially in the far northeast. Kline's
campaign thought he would be strongest in newly developing areas of
Johnson County, such as southern Overland Park, Leawood, Olathe,
Shawnee and Lenexa.
</P>
<P>
   While Musil attacked his main rival, Kline took a ``rose
garden'' approach to the campaign. He rarely criticized his
opponents in ads and let surrogates such as Kansans for Life attack
Morsch. Only in debates and direct mail did he exchange political
jabs with the two others.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were able to hold our cards close to the vest and run a
positive campaign,'' Kerr said. ``Greg ran a good hard campaign,
but he had a long way to go.''
</P>
<P>
   Morsch was the last candidate to get in the race. As an abortion
opponent, it was assumed that the Olathe, Kan., doctor would take
away support from Kline, especially in Olathe.
</P>
<P>
   One of the big questions of the campaign was not whether Morsch
would win but which of the two other candidates he would hurt more.
</P>
<P>
   Spending about $200,000, less than the other two, Morsch wasn't
able to go on television. Consequently, radio and efforts by about
1,000 volunteers were used to communicate with voters.
</P>
<P>
   Political observers predicted last week that Morsch would get
about 15 percent of the vote and draw equally from Musil and Kline.
During the campaign, he portrayed himself as a nonpolitician who
would leave office after six years.
</P>
<P>
   He became the alternative candidate for people who thought Kline
was too conservative and Musil too liberal.
</P>
<P>
   Turnout was considered a key element. The common wisdom had
Kline benefiting from a small turnout and Musil doing well if the
turnout was large.

INCUMBENT LOSES PRIMARY IN STATE BOARD RACE WITH EVOLUTION FOCUS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By KATE BEEM  
 c. 2000 Kansas City Star   KANSAS CITY, Mo. _ Moderates won a key
battle Tuesday and appeared to be winning a statewide war for
control of the Kansas Board of Education.
<TEXT>
<P>
   Linda Holloway, a conservative Republican who led the board last
year when it voted to downplay evolution in the state's science
education standards, lost by a large margin to moderate Sue Gamble
in the GOP primary for the board's 2nd District.
</P>
<P>
   With 97 percent of precincts reporting, Gamble had 24,133 votes
to Holloway's 15,921.
</P>
<P>
   In other races across the state, the conservative incumbent in
Wichita lost to her moderate challenger, and in Salina the moderate
candidate was leading the conservative. The conservative state
board member from Arkansas City, however, was soundly defeating his
moderate opponent.
</P>
<P>
   The high-profile 2nd District race symbolized the battle between
Kansas conservatives and moderates for control of the state
Republican party and the education board, which oversees the
state's 304 school districts.
</P>
<P>
   Gamble, 58, a real estate agent and veteran member of the
Shawnee Mission school board, said her door-to-door campaigning
made the difference in the campaign. When parents learned the
issues at stake, they turned out to vote, she said.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a victory for parents and children and their
education, and I could not be happier,'' Gamble said Tuesday night.
</P>
<P>
   Holloway, 50, a former teacher, said she had been portrayed as
an extremist since the vote on evolution.
</P>
<P>
   ``Unfortunately, propaganda still works,'' she said. ``The
campaign against me has been going on for over a year.''
</P>
<P>
   Gamble, who like Holloway is a Shawnee resident, faces a
challenge in the November general election from Democrat Ron
Patton, a Presbyterian minister from Fairway. The 2nd District
covers eastern and northern Johnson County.
</P>
<P>
   All the Republicans will face Democratic opposition in November,
although in Kansas in recent years, Democrats have made few inroads
into state offices.
</P>
<P>
   Half of the 10 seats on the state board are up for election this
year. Three of those seats are held by conservative Republicans,
one is held by a Democrat and one is open. The five other seats
come up for election in 2002.
</P>
<P>
   The Holloway-Gamble race was closely watched by national groups.
It also was the most expensive in state board history, with
Holloway raising about $90,000 and Gamble raising close to $36,000.
Four years ago, in her first bid for the state board, Holloway
raised $10,000.
</P>
<P>
   The evolution issue proved a powerful pull. Holloway was
chairwoman of the board in August 1999 when it approved new science
standards that delete references to the age of the Earth, the big
bang theory and some aspects of evolutionary theory. The standards
are important because they help determine what Kansas students will
be tested on.
</P>
<P>
   Immediately after that decision, science groups and Kansas
moderates promised to work to unseat Holloway and other
conservative incumbents.
</P>
<P>
   The board's vote on evolution _ the theory that living things
share common ancestors but have changed over time _ gained
international attention, with journalists from Japan and several
European countries journeying to Kansas to cover the commotion.
</P>
<P>
   The vote also reopened a national debate over science and
religion. A set of standards the board rejected, written by a
27-member committee of Kansas science teachers, would have included
evolution as a cornerstone of science.
</P>
<P>
   The six board members who voted to downplay evolution in the
standards cited, in part, their hesitancy to include information
that would go against some students' religious beliefs.
</P>
<P>
   The current board is split ideologically. Generally, the two
camps are divided between moderates, who support present public
educational policies stressing accountability, and conservatives,
who think that those methods have failed and that Kansas needs a
change of course toward more choice and competition in education.
</P>
<P>
   But moderate Harold Voth of Haven, Kan., whose seat is up in two
years, has voted with the five conservatives, most notably on the
science standards.
</P>
<P>
   The triumph of Gamble and the other moderate challengers could
mean Kansas moderates finally have achieved some sort of
grass-roots organization, said University of Kansas political
scientist Burdett Loomis. That's always been a strength of
conservatives, who use their cause as a rallying point.
</P>
<P>
   This time it was the moderates' turn, and they proved they can
work in concert, Loomis said.
</P>
<P>
   The moderates' victory also confirms what political pundits have
said for years _ that conservatives fare better when the issues are
vague and the races are low profile.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think the conservatives want attention, or they want
attention only on their terms,'' Loomis said. ``The higher the
profile, the more problems they have.''
</P>
<P>
   Val De Fever, a moderate state board member from Independence,
Kan., credited the moderates' win to their campaigning. More
national and state groups weighed in on the state board races than
ever before, which helped drive home how important the elections
are, De Fever said.
</P>
<P>
   Members of Kansas Citizens for Science, a pro-evolution group
formed after the board's vote, campaigned for moderate candidates.
In mid-July, the liberal People for the American Way Foundation
sponsored a dramatization of the famous 1925 Scopes ``monkey''
trial to draw attention to the election.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think they've done a lot of the right things,'' De Fever
said of the moderates.
</P>
<P>
   Kris Van Meteren, executive director of the conservative Kansas
Republican Assembly, thinks money was the deciding factor. Although
Holloway raised far more than her challenger, the other
conservatives came up short compared with their opponents.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's just a testament to the fact that, yeah, you can buy an
election,'' Van Meteren said.
</P>
<P>
   But the fight isn't over by a long shot, promised conservatives.
This is an ongoing battle, and the conservatives made inroads by
even suggesting that evolution be optional in school, said John
Morris, president of the Institute for Creation Research in San
Diego.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a resentment of the education elite. I think that's an
undercurrent that's undersold,'' Morris said. ``The creation
message is getting out better than ever. It will never go back to
the way it was, when people go back to doing what the education
elite say. Never again.''
</P>
<P>
   In the other races Tuesday:
</P>
<P>
   - In the 6th District, with 74 percent of precincts reporting,
moderate Republican Bruce Wyatt, an attorney from Salina, was
beating conservative Brad Angell, a former teacher from Junction
City. The winner will face Eloise Lynch, a former state legislator
from Salina, in November.
</P>
<P>
   The race had no incumbent because conservative Scott Hill, who
held the seat, moved from Abilene to Montana earlier this year.
</P>
<P>
   - With all precincts reporting, Mary Douglass Brown of Wichita,
the conservative incumbent from the 8th District, lost to moderate
Carol Rupe of Wichita. Brown is a former teacher, and Rupe is a
former Wichita school board member. The winner will face Democrat
Dick Williams of Wichita, a retired college instructor.
</P>
<P>
   - Incumbent conservative Steve Abrams, a veterinarian from
Arkansas City, was beating Roger Rankin of Longton, a former
schools superintendent. The winner will face Democrat Wayne Holt, a
former school administrator from Haysville.

EDITORIAL: THE DEFENSE DEBATE BEGINS 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Subs for rewriting throughout)  c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The New York Times said in an editorial on Wednesday, Aug. 2:
</P>
<P>
   The Republican Convention in Philadelphia set aside its
nurturing themes about children on Tuesday night and returned to
the traditional GOP territory of defense policy and military
strength. Popular war heroes like former Sen. Bob Dole and Gen.
Norman Schwarzkopf implied that the Clinton administration had let
veterans down and allowed defenses to erode. But a strangely
subdued note was struck by the keynote speaker, Sen. John McCain,
the self-described ``distant runner-up.'' His generous but
obviously unenthusiastic praise of Gov. George W. Bush was
punctuated with intimations of his own mortality. His maudlin
address seemed designed to echo Gen. Douglas MacArthur's farewell
and perhaps to suggest a subtext of ``I shall return'' if Bush
falters in November.
</P>
<P>
   Keynote speeches are usually aimed at firing up the crowd.
McCain's passive approach flattened the already placid mood of the
convention. Few delegates were likely to be convinced by his praise
of the prospective nominee as ``my friend.'' Moreover, McCain, a
former prisoner of war in Vietnam, described a convoluted
generational and military link to the Texas governor by asserting
that his grandfather had been former President George Bush's
commander in World War II. Then he conceded that ``it is my turn to
serve under the son of my grandfather's brave subordinate.''
</P>
<P>
   Before one of the most tranquilizing keynote addresses in modern
convention history, the podium on Tuesday night seemed like a kind
of class reunion for the gulf war. It was a tableau with certain
pitfalls as well as advantages for Governor Bush. Like the choice
of former Defense Secretary Dick Cheney as his running mate, the
evening reminded the audience that the war was the high point of
Bush's father's term in the White House, without offering much of a
suggestion about the policies of another Bush presidency. Some
listeners might also recall that as a senator from Tennessee, Al
Gore broke with many Democrats and supported the war.
</P>
<P>
   The idea that military spending suddenly declined under
President Clinton is also based partly on myth. The Pentagon budget
began declining under President Bush and has risen in recent years
under Clinton and his Republican defense secretary.
</P>
<P>
   Convention speeches are not to be confused with subtle foreign
policy pronouncements. But there has been a certain confusion about
Republican declarations on foreign policy that Bush will eventually
have to clear up. The mst extensive statements on the subject have
come from the governor's main foreign policy adviser, Condoleezza
Rice, who also spoke at the convention on Tuesday night. Her
criticism of the administration is that it has spent too much time
on trivial ``humanitarian'' interests and failed to deal seriously
with potential rivals like China and Russia or cultivate major
allies.
</P>
<P>
   Cooperating with allies sounds good in principle, but Bush seems
determined to embark on a risky missile defense system that major
European allies regard as unworkable. The Republican Convention, as
it has in all things, has papered over cleavages within the
domestic ranks on foreign policy. Bush had to repudiate his own
congressional leadership early this year when he called for support
of American peacekeeping efforts in Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   Sorting these issues out will come only when Vice President Gore
gets a chance to challenge Bush after the conventions. All that
Americans learned on Tuesday night was the importance of military
strength. How that strength is to be used will have to be
elucidated in the campaign to come.

LEVINE GOES ON DISABLED LIST
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JOE HAAKENSON  
 c.2000 San Gabriel Valley Tribune  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ANAHEIM, Calif. _ Right-handed reliever Al Levine was placed on
the 15-day disabled list Tuesday because of an inflamed right
elbow. Matt Wise, a product of Cal State Fullerton, was called up
from Triple-A Edmonton and will join the team today.
</P>
<P>
   Levine is 2-4 with a 3.50 ERA in 41 games. His 722/3 innings is
the most by any Angels reliever.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's been something he's been managing most of the year,''
manager Mike Scioscia said of Levine. ``He got past the point of a
comfort level. He's never refused to take the ball. We just want to
make sure we get this knocked out. He's been too big to our
bullpen.''
</P>
<P>
   The Angels decided to call up Wise instead of Ramon Ortiz
because Wise is better-suited to pitch out of the bullpen. However,
Wise has started all season for Edmonton. In 19 starts he is 9-6
with a 3.69 ERA, including two complete games and one shutout.
</P>
<P>
   ``With Ramon and his history of shoulder trouble in spring
training, we don't want to take him out of his routine,'' Scioscia
said. ``Wise has the ability to pitch out of the bullpen.''
</P>
<P>
   Wise was part of a starting rotation at Double-A Erie early last
season that included Brian Cooper, Seth Etherton and Ortiz.
</P>
<P>
   ``You talk about the young pitchers in the organization, and
Matt Wise's name is up there with any of them,'' Scioscia said.
</P>
<P>
   GLAD IT'S AUGUST: Other than his trip to Atlanta for the
All-Star Game, July was a month third baseman Troy Glaus probably
would like to forget.
</P>
<P>
   His power numbers _ eight homers and 15 RBI _ were fine, but he
had only 19 hits and batted .194 in the month. So, on the first day
of August, Scioscia gave Glaus the day off.
</P>
<P>
   ``He wanted to play,'' Scioscia said. ``Sure, he was a little
(ticked) off. He looked at me cross-eyed. But it's important to
give him a breather.''
</P>
<P>
   As Scioscia explained his reasoning for the off-day, Darin
Erstad walked by and asked who Scioscia was talking about. When
told it was Glaus, Erstad laughed and said: ``You benched him?''
Scioscia was quick to reply: ``No, it's a day off. It's not a
benching.''
</P>
<P>
   Scioscia said he will start giving his regular players a little
more rest this month to keep them fresh for September.
</P>
<P>
   QUICK JAUNT: After today's game, the Angels will go on a brief
road trip for three games in Cleveland. They will face ex-Angel
Chuck Finley on Saturday. On May 31, Finley and the Indians beat
the Angels 7-3 in Cleveland. &QL;

YANKEES TOP ROYALS, 5-4 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Subs for rewriting throughout; adds byline)   By JACK CURRY   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Dwight Gooden's revival continued on Tuesday night,
which meant that one of the most surprising developments of a long
season continued for the New York Yankees. Gooden pitched seven
competent innings for one of the best teams in baseball and made it
difficult to fathom how he was unemployed before George
Steinbrenner offered him one more chance.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, Gooden has devoured the chance, has helped stabilize
the Yankees and has made them look shrewd for believing in him
again. While Gooden was impeccable on Tuesday night at Yankee
Stadium, the bullpen was not, so Gooden lost his chance for a
victory when Mike Stanton frittered away a two-run bulge in the
eighth and the Kansas City Royals rallied to tie the score.
</P>
<P>
   But Scott Brosius saved Stanton by hammering a homer off Ricky
Bottalico to lead off the bottom of the eighth and vault the
Yankees to a dramatic 5-4 victory. Since Brosius had stranded six
runners in his first three at-bats and had not homered in 14 games,
he tossed the bat aside, raised his arms in the air like Rocky
Balboa and scampered around the bases.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was one of those times where you could walk away with a
smile after struggling a bit,'' Brosius said.
</P>
<P>
   Gooden could definitely smile after continuing to do something
that was supposed to be a surprise, and is now looking more and
more like a routine. He had a sturdy fastball, precise control and
enormous confidence, allowing one earned run and four hits in his
longest outing of the season. He gave Manager Joe Torre enough
evidence to prove that the 35-year-old Gooden should stay in the
rotation.
</P>
<P>
   Torre admitted that he never expected Gooden to be in a pivotal
position. But Gooden, who signed a minor league contract in June,
is 3-0 with a 1.86 earned run average for the Yankees after adding
a changeup and being more aggressive. It will be difficult for
Torre to remove him from the rotation, even if David Cone is
excellent in his next start.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can't top what he did tonight,'' Torre said about Gooden.
``It's fun for me to watch. I know he has to be thrilled about
it.''
</P>
<P>
   After abominable stints with the Houston Astros and Tampa Bay
Devil Rays and a near retirement, Gooden thought about what he had
accomplished and said, ``It might sound crazy, but I'm more relaxed
now.''
</P>
<P>
   With the Yankees trailing by 2-1 in the seventh, Chuck Knoblauch
walked and stole second, and Royals starter Dan Reichert followed
by walking Derek Jeter. After the left-hander Tim Byrdak struck out
Paul O'Neill, Bernie Williams smashed a two-run double to left.
David Justice followed with a double to make it 4-2, a refreshing
change for the Yankees, who had stranded two in the fifth and three
in the sixth after Brosius whiffed.
</P>
<P>
   Gooden was six outs from his fourth victory with the Yankees and
he had thrown only 79 pitches, but Torre turned to Stanton in the
eighth. A one-out single, a walk and Johnny Damon's booming double
off the fence in right-center field, which was a few feet from
being a three-run homer, tied the score, 4-4. The Royals later
loaded the bases against Jeff Nelson, but Nelson fanned Joe Randa
and pumped his fist as he returned to the dugout. All of the
Yankees were celebrating a few moments later when Brosius belted
Bottalico's 1-0 fastball over the left-field fence.

HOLLANDSWORTH HAS MIXED FEELINGS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By BRIAN DOHN  
 c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   PITTSBURGH _ Even though outfielder Todd Hollandsworth's last
months of his Dodgers career weren't ideal _ his role was unsettled
and his performance wasn't up to snuff _ he said he had mixed
feelings about Monday's trade that sent him and a pair of
minor-leaguers to Colorado for center fielder Tom Goodwin.
</P>
<P>
   ``The first thing that keeps coming into my mind is it's a fresh
start,'' Hollandsworth said Tuesday from his Chicago hotel room.
``I had tears in my eyes when I left yesterday. I've been in a
Dodgers uniform since I was 18. It was different and it was
shocking. I didn't think anything would happen.
</P>
<P>
   ``As I was sitting on the plane going into Chicago (Monday), I
thought it was refreshing and a shot in my arm. I have a mixed
approach. They're a great group of guys (in Los Angeles) and they
have a chance to be in the playoffs, and I'm grateful I was able to
be a part of it for four months.''
</P>
<P>
   Hollandsworth, like Goodwin, joined his new team Tuesday. And
Hollandsworth had an immediate impact as his bases-loaded single in
the eighth inning gave the Rockies a 2-1 win at Wrigley Field.
</P>
<P>
   A free agent after the season, Hollandsworth, 27, is excited
about the opportunity to play for the Rockies, and at Coors Field,
and he's already spoken with Colorado general manager Dan O'Dowd
about his future. While the discussions were preliminary and a
contract extension wasn't the topic, Hollandsworth's future in
Colorado was a big part of it.
</P>
<P>
   ``They reiterated with me that this thing was not just trying to
reduce salary (by moving Goodwin), and that I was a part of their
plans,'' Hollandsworth said. ``I said I wouldn't mind being here in
the future.''
</P>
<P>
   Hollandsworth never said publicly he was unhappy in Los Angeles,
but everyone agreed a change of scenery was for the best. And the
Dodgers realized their chance to re-sign him after the season was a
shade better than nil. Dodgers general manager Kevin Malone tried
to deal him before the 1999 season and also was working on deals
this season before Devon White was injured May 2 diving for a ball
in the outfield.
</P>
<P>
   Hollandsworth, the 1996 National League Rookie of the Year,
didn't perform up to expectations, partly because the Dodgers' lack
of a leadoff hitter forced him into that role when he's better
elsewhere in the order. He batted .234 with eight homers and 24 RBI
with the Dodgers.
</P>
<P>
   ``My role was different all the time, and as a player,
uniformity is what you seek,'' Hollandsworth said. ``At times, I
struggled with my role. But I have a lot of good memories, a lot of
good friends from my time there.''
</P>
<P>
   DEVO'S ROLE: Dodgers manager Davey Johnson met with White for
about 25 minutes prior to the doubleheader to discuss what White's
role will be now that Goodwin is with the team.
</P>
<P>
   ``I told him I was going to give (Goodwin) the opportunity to
play predominantly center field and that I needed Devo, who's a guy
that I felt like could play a corner,'' Johnson said. ``I know he
could hit in the middle of a lineup for (Gary) Sheffield or (Shawn)
Green when they weren't in the lineup, and that's something that I
haven't had.''
</P>
<P>
   ODDS AND ENDS: The club is expected to activate utility
outfielder F.P. Santangelo today, but he won't be with the team in
Pittsburgh because, once activated, he must serve his five-game
suspension resulting from the May 16 fight at Wrigley Field. It's
likely utility player Chris Donnels will be placed on the 15-day
disabled list. ... Pitcher Kevin Brown was ejected after the top of
the seventh inning of the second game, following Gary Sheffield's
strikeout with the bases loaded. ... Dodgers right-hander Greg
Olson appeared in his first game since April 8, allowing a solo
homer to Bruce Aven in the seventh inning of the first game. It was
the first homer allowed by the Dodgers in 332/3 innings. &QL;

NO RELIEF FOR WETTELAND, RANGERS
</HEADLINE>
 SOX-TEX (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By T.R. SULLIVAN 
c.2000 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   ARLINGTON, Texas _ The past seven days for Texas Rangers closer
John Wetteland couldn't have been that difficult. All that has
happened is:
</P>
<P>
   _ Contract-extension negotiations with the Rangers went nowhere.
</P>
<P>
   _ He was subject to numerous trade rumors that had him being
sent to either Los Angeles, Atlanta or somewhere in between. All
other locations were ruled out.
</P>
<P>
   _ His wife, Michele, gave birth Monday to a son, J.D., but only
after going through a difficult delivery.
</P>
<P>
   Having endured all that, Wetteland still had to go out and
pitch, but the result wasn't a happy one. This was not a fairy
tale.
</P>
<P>
   Charles Johnson whacked a slider from Wetteland into the
left-field bleachers with one out in the ninth inning to give the
Chicago White Sox a 4-3 victory over the Rangers at The Ballpark in
Arlington on Tuesday night.
</P>
<P>
   One look at Wetteland, both before and after the game, made it
clear this has been a weary time for him. He admitted it had been a
long time since he had slept. But he refused to blame any of that
for what happened Tuesday night.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's still my job to go out and pitch,'' Wetteland said. ``You
don't blame one mistake on mental duress. That's silly. I made a
mistake and he hit it. If I don't make a mistake, he doesn't hit
it. There's no reason why I shouldn't be able to execute on that
one particular pitch. You saw the other at-bats. There was no
reason not to execute on that at-bat.''
</P>
<P>
   Wetteland struck out two of the four batters he faced in the
ninth. But Johnson's home run sent the Rangers to their third
consecutive loss and left them eight games behind the Oakland
Athletics in the wild-card playoff race.
</P>
<P>
   The Rangers also remain entrenched in last place in the American
League West, which is why there was much speculation about
Wetteland being traded before Monday's nonwaiver deadline. But
Wetteland, who can be a free agent after the season, insisted such
talk was not a distraction.
</P>
<P>
   Asked if he was glad the deadline had passed, Wetteland said,
``Yes ... no ... maybe. It's hard to answer that question when all
I've been saying for the past month is all that is noise. But the
noise will continue. Players are out of their minds if they don't
think they're put on waivers after the trade deadline.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nothing definitive happened. All that happened is the trade
deadline came and went. Really, what does that mean? If Wayne
Gretzky can be traded, anybody can get traded, and I'm certainly
not in his class.''
</P>
<P>
   Wetteland said his mind has been more on his wife, Michele, than
contract talks or trade rumors. Michele finally gave birth on
Monday and both mother and child are doing fine, but Wetteland
admitted there were rough moments.
</P>
<P>
   ``She has some pretty good complications,'' Wetteland said. ``We
spent from seven in the morning until 11 at night at the hospital.
The baby had a few complications which were hard to get through.
But everything is cool, everything is under control. I was never
worried, it's just tough to see your wife and mother-in-law go
through what they did.''
</P>
<P>
   The loss was Wetteland's fourth of the season and came on a
night when starter Ryan Glynn held the White Sox to one run through
seven innings. The White Sox got two runs off relievers Doug Davis
and Jeff Zimmerman in the eighth before the Rangers tied it in the
bottom of the inning on Gabe Kapler's two-run single.
</P>
<P>
   ``I kept my team in the game, which is important,'' Glynn said.
``You're just trying to not give up runs, whether it's 10-0 or 1-0.
(White Sox starter) James Baldwin is a tough matchup. That's the
way the game goes.''
</P>
<P>
   The game is unrelenting. It offers no rest, even for a pitcher
who has gone through an incredible amount over the course of a
week. Happy endings are only for fairy tales.

MIGHTY-FINE COOK FIRES A 10-UNDER 62 FOR $125,000 PAYDAY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)

 c.2000 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEWCASTLE, Wash. _ As it turned out, 10 more players wouldn't
have made any difference at Fred Couples' Wells Fargo Invitational.
</P>
<P>
   John Cook was enough.
</P>
<P>
   He turned Couples' sixth-annual get-together into his own
personal crusade Tuesday at The Golf Club at Newcastle. He shot a
course-record, 10-under-par 62 in the final round, giving him 131
overall. That was good for a three-stroke victory and a $125,000
paycheck _ making him the event's first repeat winner.
</P>
<P>
   Someone forgot to tell the 20-year PGA Tour veteran this was an
exhibition.
</P>
<P>
   He played like his career depended on it. Maybe it did.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're calling this one of the greatest rounds in state of
Washington history,'' quipped Couples, as Cook entered the
interview room.
</P>
<P>
   Cook, 42, brought the right kind of low numbers to an event that
had, in Couples' words, teetered from low numbers _ from player
withdrawals. He made the charity fund-raiser, attended by an
estimated 12,000 people over two days in perfect weather
conditions, a success.
</P>
<P>
   When it was over, people asked him about his putting stroke, his
unflappable demeanor. Unsolicited, Cook wanted to discuss
relationships. He pointed out how he and Couples have known each
other since they were junior golfers, how he comes to this event
every year without fail.
</P>
<P>
   Hopefully, the players who didn't show were listening.
</P>
<P>
   ``You learn things about commitment and loyalty,'' Cook said.
``We learned that from the generation before us. Hopefully, the
kids today will learn from that. That's where you start gaining
respect. This game has been pretty good for all of us.''
</P>
<P>
   Tuesday, the 18-hole exercise at Newcastle treated Cook, a
10-event Tour winner who has struggled of late, better than anyone
else.
</P>
<P>
   He had nine birdies, never going more than two consecutive holes
without lowering his score. He made eight putts from 10 feet or
less. He made a 30-footer for another birdie, a 25-footer to save
par.
</P>
<P>
   ``That was an unbelievable round,'' said Couples, who finished
fifth, 11 strokes back. ``It's not like other guys were shooting
67. If we had 50 guys here, you wouldn't be seeing 64s and 65s.''
</P>
<P>
   Cook started the day trailing Brent Geiberger by three strokes.
Geiberger did nothing to hurt his cause, following up a first-round
66 with a 68. But five holes into it Tuesday, Cook had a share of
the lead. Once they made the turn, Cook had the top of the
leaderboard all to himself and never let go.
</P>
<P>
   One of the more even personalities on Tour, Cook seemed to enjoy
himself as he toured the hillside course. Nothing could upset him.
As he stepped onto the seventh tee, he good-naturedly said,
``Mute,'' to a noisy gallery.
</P>
<P>
   Cook was midway through his swing when the door on a portable
restroom slammed shut. Responsible was a tall, dark-haired woman
oblivious to the surroundings.
</P>
<P>
   ``Mrs. Geiberger,'' joked Peter Jacobsen, one of Cook's playing
partners.
</P>
<P>
   When Cook sank his 30-footer on the 15th hole, Scott McCarron,
watching from the 16th, bowed while Cook fluttered his arms around
like a bird. Everybody was having fun.
</P>
<P>
   Cook hopes it continues. The other time he won the Couples
event, in 1995, his career got an unexpected boost. He beat Jeff
Gove by a stroke at Overlake Golf and Country Club, shooting rounds
of 71 and 63. He went on to win in Mexico and then claim two tour
events in 1996.
</P>
<P>
   This year, he's 105th on the money list with a fifth-place
finish his top effort on Tour. Another resurgence would be
appreciated, starting this week at the International near Denver.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not that you forget how to win, you forget how to get
there,'' Cook said.
</P>
<P>
   He knows his way to Seattle. And, yes, he'll be back.

AFTER CONVENTION SESSION, FORD IS TAKEN TO HOSPITAL

<TEXT>
<P>
   PHILADELPHIA _ Former President Gerald Ford was taken to
Hahnemann University Hospital on Tuesday night with an unspecified
illness.
</P>
<P>
   Ford, 87, apparently was driven to the hospital in Center City
after Tuesday night's session of the Republican Convention, where
he was celebrated along with other former Republcian presidents.
</P>
<P>
   Ford, sitting along side his wife, Betty, appeared frail and was
visibly moved when a video-taped tribute to him was displayed on
the large screens inside the First Union Center here. He rose and
waved to acknowledge the cheers.
</P>
<P>
   He spent the night sitting in a VIP box at the back of the hall
along with Former President George Bush, Nancy Reagan, Bob Dole and
other prominent Republicans. Although Ford did not address the
crowd he told C-Span earlier that this would be the last convention
he would attend.

KIDS' GAMES BELONG TO THOSE IN UNIFORMS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By LAURA VECSEY  
 c.2000 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEATTLE _ My friend had a good run with his Queen Anne Little
League team this season. But when I ran into him the other day, he
had a lot of mixed emotions about whether he'll coach next year.
</P>
<P>
   In light of all the news lately about out-of-control parents, my
friend said he is seeing behavioral breakdowns on a pretty regular
basis.
</P>
<P>
   It makes you wonder whether youth leagues are any place for
kids.
</P>
<P>
   This is supposed to be my column, but today, it's my friend's
space. Here are some of the things he told me.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've really struggled with how to balance doing it for the
kids versus competitive reasons. Coaches, myself included, and
parents _ everyone's ego gets involved. How much emphasis do you
put on winning versus having fun.''
</P>
<P>
   During the regular season, the coach said he stresses
sportsmanship, being a team player, hustle. Unfortunately, so many
of those ideals get undermined on game day.
</P>
<P>
   ``We played some interleague games against another neighborhood
team. There were some jerky coaches and parents screaming. People
were arguing calls and getting out the rule book. It just makes you
sick. It's embarrassing. And the kids don't enjoy it.''
</P>
<P>
   The disappointment in his voice was obvious.
</P>
<P>
   ``You know, it's not easy to talk about all these things,
because all these (parents) are pillars of the community. There are
doctors and lawyers. ... During one game, we were beating this team
pretty good and it turned into a nightmare. One (parent) kept
screaming at the ump and before long, other parents were booing and
screaming, too.
</P>
<P>
   ``Finally, no one wanted to play anymore. It was cold. It was a
blowout. All the kids were just like, `Let's call the game.' The
screaming really tainted the game.''
</P>
<P>
   The stress a parent can create is alarming, the coach said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I swear, kids have better games when their parents aren't
around. It's about egos. Parents get a sense of self-worth with
regard to how well their kids play. It used to be you'd go out and
play baseball in the sandlot. It's totally changed. Now kids play
because their parents want them to play. When was the last time you
went to a park and saw kids playing ball without parents around?
</P>
<P>
   ``There are some parents who undress their kids if they strike
out. They give them a whole set of instructions after they missed
the ball, and it makes them feel completely worthless.
</P>
<P>
   ``All the kids want is to be encouraged, no matter what they do.
What parents and coaches should be doing is fostering a place where
kids aren't afraid to fail.''
</P>
<P>
   Toward the end of our conversation, all the anecdotes piling up
like lead weights, it seemed as if the coach was completely
discouraged with Little League. But then again ...
</P>
<P>
   ``I have a feeling it will get to be January and I'll start to
wonder who we should draft, who's grown three inches,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I love the game and hanging out on a sunny day, hearing the
kids joking with each other on the bench. It's so much fun. Little
League baseball is wild. There are the massive comebacks. There are
some incredible success stories. We had a kid who didn't get a hit
all year, and he comes up in the last game against the fastest
pitcher in the bottom of the sixth with two outs and bases loaded
and he rips a single down the line,'' the coach said.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was impossible, and he did it. We had this other kid, he
was like 0-for-20 but during this one stretch, he gets six hits,
makes two diving catches, and we were laughing because he almost
had his eyes closed. Still, it was pretty special.''
</P>
<P>
   The coach had gotten back to what Little League is supposed to
be about: The kids, their moments.
</P>
<P>
   In the end, it might help reinvigorate him. Then again, since
the season ended a few weeks ago, the coach can't stop thinking
about an angry father who confronted him in a parking lot before a
big game about his son's playing time.
</P>
<P>
   ``Before I can even get out of my car, this guy's in my face and
he was just ranting. He wasn't even making any sense, he was so
mad.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It's hard enough meeting the expectations of a dozen 11- and
12-year-olds, but to have to meet every parent's expectation, too?
I guarantee you, someone's not going to be happy.''
</P>
<P>
   What a shame.

   As Monday Night Football retools, Cosell's status as legend
secure
</P>
<P>
   By MICKEY HERSKOWITZ
</P>
<P>
   Houston Chronicle
</P>
<P>
   Before we all begin to hyperventilate over the reinvention of
Monday Night Football, allow us to set the record straight. Dennis
Miller, the comic and social satirist, is not inheriting the Howard
Cosell chair in the three-man booth. No one ever has. No one ever
will.
</P>
<P>
   There is no point in trying to compare the stand-up star of his
own HBO show with the one-time Brooklyn lawyer turned sportscaster.
This may or may not be to Miller's advantage. But let us reset the
stage. In the 1970s, ABC introduced pro football to Monday night,
with Frank Gifford representing the fans who wanted to watch the
game, Cosell on hand for the ones who wanted a show, and Don
Meredith catering to those who weren't sure.
</P>
<P>
   As it happens, we find ourselves at a curious intersection of
past and present, of nostalgia and nonsense yet to come. Miller is
a brilliant wit whose one-liners will add a new dimension to the
longest-running prime-time series in television history. But Cosell
didn't connect with the fans because he was funny. Of course, he
wasn't known for his restraint, either.
</P>
<P>
   Quite simply, Howard aroused in viewers emotions that they had
usually reserved for wrestlers or politicians, although not
necessarily in that order. He prided himself on bringing ``sports
journalism'' to the small screen. He also became a symbol of the
excess that television had brought to our games, of an assault upon
civility. Like Howard, TV demanded action.
</P>
<P>
   If ABC's intent is to inject this entertainment with new vigor
and sizzle, bully for them. They might actually do it. Dan Fouts is
almost the forgotten man in this package, but he was a Hall of Fame
quarterback and has the capacity to surprise us. And no one is
better at describing the drama as it unfolds than Al Michaels.
</P>
<P>
   In a sense, Miller and Fouts will be sharing the role of
Meredith, the ex-Dallas Cowboy and down-home, small-town Texan who
played off Cosell perfectly. ``I just waited for Howard to make a
mistake,'' Meredith recently told Sports Illustrated, ``and I never
had to wait long.''
</P>
<P>
   But Dennis isn't going to communicate with the fans, or
antagonize them, as Howard did because he doesn't take himself
seriously enough. The beard keeps him from coming across as a smug
adolescent, but we understand his role. He is there to give us a
chuckle, an offbeat remark, a fan's insight. But if his jokes make
us think too hard, the experiment won't work.
</P>
<P>
   If anyone out there in TV land is yearning for a return to the
'70s, they can forget it. This crew will never match the aura of
Gifford, Cosell and Meredith, even though that combination lasted
just five years. Dandy Don left, came back, left again, and went on
to lead a quiet life. Lung cancer stilled the distinctive voice of
Humble Howard in 1995, a decade after he had left the booth.
Gifford was eased out one step down at a time, moving to analyst,
then into the studio, then into his living room.
</P>
<P>
   Comics of the '70s rushed to imitate Cosell. Once, taking a
break from working on a book with Howard, I wandered into a New
York nightclub called Catch a Rising Star. Gabe Kaplan, then the
star of the sitcom Welcome Back, Kotter, was on the stage doing an
imitation of Cosell broadcasting the Crucifixion.
</P>
<P>
   Asked to describe Howard's voice, Billy Crystal once said,
``Think of a man with a bad sinus condition and a large
vocabulary.''
</P>
<P>
   At the peak of Monday Night Football, ABC received 5,000 letters
a week about Cosell, a majority wanting him off the air. Howard
attributed this reaction to television's weakness for ex-jock
glamour boys. ``The fans of this country,'' he declared, ``have
been fed the pablum of the ex-football Giants for 15 years. So they
ask, `Who is this guy to come out of nowhere and tell us how good
or bad a player is?'''
</P>
<P>
   It was part of Howard's nature that he would have been puzzled
if he thought Gifford, Pat Summerall or Kyle Rote, to name three
ex-Giants, would take such a remark personally. Beneath that
brilliant ego, his skin was as thin as Kleenex. One unpleasant
letter plunged him into gloom. You could imagine what 5,000 might
have done.
</P>
<P>
   The cast has changed. The game has changed. The country has
changed. You doubt Dennis Miller will get death threats, as Cosell
did. Crowds no longer demonstrate outside the local ABC affiliates
because their team didn't make the halftime highlights. Taverns no
longer give prizes to people for tossing a brick through a TV
screen at Howard's face.
</P>
<P>
   Out of respect for all the nutrition Monday Night Football has
provided us the past 30 years, you may consider this space a
tension-free zone, with no references to Miller Time or the
chemistry of the new crew in the booth.

   Torn ACL ends Biggio's year
</P>
<P>
   By CARLTON THOMPSON
</P>
<P>
   Houston Chronicle
</P>
<P>
   It took almost 13 years and exactly 1,800 games, but on Tuesday
an injury finally got the best of Craig Biggio.
</P>
<P>
   The gritty Astros second baseman, who never has spent a day on
the disabled list, is headed to the DL with a torn anterior
cruciate ligament and a torn medial collateral ligament in his left
knee. He is out for the remainder of the season.
</P>
<P>
   The injury occurred in the seventh inning of Tuesday's 4-3
victory over the Marlins at Pro Player Stadium. Biggio was
attempting to turn a double play at second base when Marlins center
fielder Preston Wilson slid into his left leg, sending Biggio to
the ground in obvious pain.
</P>
<P>
   ``I felt like I got whacked in a football game,'' said Biggio,
who also revealed he has been playing with a torn ligament in his
right ankle. ``I wasn't in a lot of pain, but it just felt weird.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is just par for the course the way things have gone for
us this year. For it to end like this is a little depressing, but
I'll be back in spring training with a positive attitude, ready to
come back from this.''
</P>
<P>
   Biggio injured his ankle two months ago in an outfield collision
with Lance Berkman, although the club has been calling it a high
ankle sprain.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you play the game of baseball, these things are going to
happen,'' Biggio said. ``You're going to have a lot of takeouts in
the middle of the infield. Unfortunately, I got hurt on this one.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's frustrating, because I've never been on the disabled
list. Even though we're not having a good year, the team is
starting to play better, and I'd like to be a part of that.''
</P>
<P>
   Despite the victory, the attitude in the Astros' clubhouse was
very solemn as news spread about the severity of Biggio's injury.
Moises Alou, who missed the entire 1999 season because of a torn
ACL, could relate to what must have been running through Biggio's
mind.
</P>
<P>
   ``You just feel bad for the guy,'' Alou said. ``You really don't
even want to say anything to him except, `I love you.' I've been
through it, and there's nothing anyone can say to you to make you
feel better.
</P>
<P>
   ``If there's anything good about this, it's that he's got a
couple months left in this season and the entire offseason to try
to get strong and come back. He'll have plenty of time to get
healthy. We're going to miss him. He was just starting to come
around with the bat. I just feel really sorry for the guy right
now.''
</P>
<P>
   Astros general manager Gerry Hunsicker said Biggio will undergo
an MRI exam Friday to confirm the injury and that surgery will be
scheduled after that.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's really no doubt about the diagnosis,'' Hunsicker said.
``It's pretty clear-cut. He'll stay with the team for the rest of
the trip. There's no sense of urgency, and that also will allow
some time for the swelling to go down.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's been that kind of year for us. It's been a year to forget
from many standpoints, and this just adds to it.''
</P>
<P>
   Biggio, 34, has been an iron man throughout his career.
Ironically, Pro Player Stadium is where his club-record streak of
494 consecutive games came to an end on Aug. 5 1998.
</P>
<P>
   The seven-time National League All-Star and three-time team Most
Valuable Player took pride in his iron-man streak and his ability
to play through injuries that might have disabled other players.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you're going to go on the DL, you might as well go on with
the big one, and the ACL is big,'' Biggio said. ``Hey, you have to
make light of it somehow. I'm going to work my butt off over the
winter to come back from this. To be able to avoid the disabled
list for as long as I did was a nice little streak to have. It's
upsetting, but there's nothing you can do about it now.''
</P>
<P>
   Said Astros righthander Scott Elarton: ``The one thing you could
always guarantee is that Bidge is going to be ready to play every
day. It's going to be tough not to see him out there at second base
for the rest of the season.''
</P>
<P>
   Utility man Bill Spiers replaced Biggio on Tuesday, but it's
uncertain how manager Larry Dierker will handle second base for the
remainder of the season. Spiers and Julio Lugo appear to be the
best options. As of Tuesday night, Hunsicker was uncertain of the
coinciding roster move when Biggio goes on the DL.
</P>
<P>
   ``Bidge is the emotional center of our team,'' Dierker said.
``He plays with such energy; it's almost beyond enthusiasm. He
plays with a rage to win. It's pretty hard to ignore a guy who does
that. It's pretty hard not to miss him.
</P>
<P>
   ``It will probably be harder for him to come back from this
injury than it would have 10 years ago. But I know Bidge, and you
can bet he's going to come back next spring with that same rage to
win.''

<TEXT>
<P>
   PHILADELPHIA _ Sen. John McCain shed his rebellious image to
play the admiring party stalwart at the Republican National
Convention Tuesday night, commending Gov. George W. Bush to
independents and Democrats and _ addressing one of the governor's
most pronounced vulnerabilities _ saying he would ably defend the
nation's interests abroad.
</P>
<P>
   ``I support him,'' said a subdued McCain, trying to erase
tensions from a primary battle that had been so raw that McCain
waited two months to reluctantly endorse Bush. ``I am grateful to
him. And I am proud of him.''
</P>
<P>
   McCain's speech anchored an evening whose overarching objective
was to assemble several faces, old and new, and invoke symbols of
military might like the Persian Gulf War. The intention was to
assure the national viewing audience that Bush could be trusted
both as a commander in chief and someone who could provide a steady
hand in foreign policy despite his lack of experience in the field.
</P>
<P>
   Thoughout the evening, a cavalcade of military heroes _ from
McCain to Bob Dole to Gen. J. Norman Schwarzkopf to Sen. Chuck
Hagel _ offered testimonials to Bush, who did not serve in Vietnam.
</P>
<P>
   Joining the chorus in the other high-profile speech was
Condoleezza Rice, Bush's chief international affairs adviser who,
as an African American, also underscores Bush's pledge to put
minorities in consequential roles.
</P>
<P>
   ``The George W. Bush I know is a man of uncommonly good
judgment,'' Rice, a national security council official in former
President Bush's administration, said. ``He is focused and
consistent. He believes that we Americans are at our best when we
exercise power without fanfare or arrogance. He speaks plainly and
with a positive spirit.''
</P>
<P>
   The speeches were testimonials to the personal ability McCain,
Rice and the other speakers perceived in Bush, but offered little
on specific policies or countries.
</P>
<P>
   Besides trying to shore up Bush's record, a cavalcade of
speakers reminded the public of Republican presidents like Ronald
Reagan and George Bush who were known for eliciting respect for
America abroad and for their emphasis on national security.
</P>
<P>
   Schwarzkopf, commander of allied forces in the Persian Gulf war,
appeared via satellite from a battleship, reminding the convention
that ``10 years ago tomorrow, Iraq invaded Kuwait.'' He asked:
``Wouldn't it be great for our armed forces, and for America, if we
could have another commander in chief named George Bush?''
</P>
<P>
   Dole, the Republican nominee four years ago who was wounded in
World War II, asked the audience to ``join me in saluting the
greatest generation of veterans and every generation of our armed
services.''
</P>
<P>
   Elizabeth Dole, who had a starring role at the convention in
1996 when she spoke reverentially of her husband, said that
``timeless values form our first line of defense.'' Bush, she said,
``will put an end to the smash-mouth politics of recent years and
to the name-calling that tarnishes our trust and alienates so many
real people whose real problems can never be solved in a focus
group or soothed by a spin doctor.''
</P>
<P>
   To drive home the theme of military might, there was a video
tribute to World War II veterans and a musical medley of military
service anthems.
</P>
<P>
   Bush's popularity afforded him the freedom to play to a broader
audience outside the hall by giving a speaking slot (albeit not in
prime time) to an openly gay congressman, Rep. Jim Kolbe of
Arizona, who spoke about international trade.
</P>
<P>
   During his remarks, several members of the Texas delegation
protested by taking off their cowboy hats and bowing their heads in
prayer. Most of the delegates were respectful but offered Kolbe
only weak applause.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're not all the way there with our party,'' Kolbe, speaking
of his party's policy toward homosexuals, said on ``Political
Points,'' the Webcast of The New York Times and ABC News. ``The
Democratic Party isn't all the way there yet either in terms of its
treatment of minorities and other groups.''
</P>
<P>
   So concerted was the outreach to Democrats from the stage here
that the convention played a videotape featuring the words of
Franklin Delano Roosevelt.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the gauzy, smiling images of moderation from the stage,
there were stirrings of resentment among some conservatives who
voiced concerns that the convention did not truly reflect their
views. At a crowded Christian Coalition rally at a downtown hotel,
delegates seemed thrilled to hear some of the conservative, red
meat rhetoric missing from the convention hall.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know this is a convention of sweetness and light,'' Pat
Robertson, the coalition's founder, declared to the crowd. ``Nobody
wants to rock the boat.''
</P>
<P>
   Mike St. Clair, a delegate from Ankeny, Iowa, complained that
the party was not putting forth enough contrast with the Democrats.
``There must be some contrast, otherwise it is hard for people to
become passionate,'' he said. ``You have to be able to see the
differences between the parties.''
</P>
<P>
   Just before 9 p.m., delegates rose in applause to a tableau
representing every living Republican president: Gerald Ford and his
wife, Betty, and Nancy Reagan joined former President and Mrs.
Barbara Bush in the prime viewing seats overlooking the convention.
Mrs. Dole also sat with them.
</P>
<P>
   In the midst of the video tributes to Ford, the audience broke
out in applause at the mention of Mrs. Ford's hospitalization for
breast cancer _ and then, across the convention hall, rose to their
feets. Mr. and Mrs. Ford waved back in thanks.
</P>
<P>
   Then one of the most popular figures in Republican politics,
Barbara Bush, appeared unnannounced and greeted the crowd: ``I hope
that I am the first person to welcome you to Philadelphia: the city
of motherly love.''
</P>
<P>
   She then introduced her son, who appeared before the convention
by a satellite hookup for the second night in a row. This time, the
location was Gettysburg, Pa., where Abraham Lincoln delivered a
famous speech and where general-turned-president Dwight Eisenhower
once lived. Governor Bush praised McCain, saying, ``His straight
talk and strong convictions are admired across America.''
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   But the evening was clearly dominated by McCain. The Bush
campaign's decision to give a vanquished rival such a prominent
role on the second night of the convention marked a striking
departure from the last several Republican conventions. At the
convention four years ago, the prized Tuesday night slot was given
to then Rep. Susan Molinari, who had been one of Dole's most loyal
backers.
</P>
<P>
   The Bush campaign's decision to give McCain such a high profile
underscored not only that McCain has emerged as an influential
force in his party but also that Bush is so popular among
Republicans that he does not have to worry that McCain would draw
too much attention.
</P>
<P>
   For his part, McCain clearly recognized that there was no
political upside to stirring up trouble for the Texas governor and
that he could score points by playing the loyal trooper.
Strikingly, he was so determined to fall in line behind Bush that
he did not even raise his signature issue of campaign finance
reform, something he relentlessly brings up every chance he gets.
He even played down his achievement of winning the New Hampshire
and Michigan primaries, calling himself ``a distant runner-up.''
</P>
<P>
   But his comments Tuesday night led some of McCain's most ardent
backers to privately grouse that he was being too adulatory, and
abandoning his greatest attribute _ his maverick nature.
</P>
<P>
   McCain, who drew a potent following from independents and
Democrats during the primaries, implored his followers to rally
behind Bush.
</P>
<P>
   ``I say to all Americans, Republican, Democrat or independent,''
he asserted, ``if you believe America deserves leaders with a
purpose more ennobling than expediency and opportunism, then vote
for Governor Bush. If you believe patriotism is more than a
soundbite and public service should be more than a photo-op, then
vote for Governor Bush.''
</P>
<P>
   Former Sen. Alan K. Simpson of Wyoming said McCain knew it was
not in his interest to be a political menace at the convention.
``He has a great future with the party,'' Simpson said. ``You never
want to be known as a poor loser. He wants to be loved like all of
us. He wants to be a player.''
</P>
<P>
   While the speakers touched on a panoply of foreign-policy
issues, the matters left unaddressed were telling. For example,
despite Schwarzkopf's praise of former President Bush for leading
the coalition to victory in the Persian Gulf, American warplanes
are still bombing Iraq and President Saddam Hussein is as firmly
entrenched as ever.
</P>
<P>
   Rice said that Governor Bush would never allow the United States
to be blackmailed by outlaw states, and urged swift construction of
a national missile defense to safeguard against missile strikes.
But she laid out no new plan to defend against stateless terrorists
who might use the much cheaper and equally deadly alternative of a
truck bomb attack.
</P>
<P>
   In her speech, Rice depicted Governor Bush as a bilingual
internationalist, meeting with leaders from Mexico, Russia and
South Africa. But, in fact, many of the meetings were little more
than handshakes and hellos. President Thabo Mleki of South Africa
called his visit to the governor's mansion in May a ``courtesy
call.''
</P>
<P>
   While in Washington in April, Bush met briefly in his hotel with
Russian Foreign Minister Igor Ivanov to discuss Chechnya and the
Anti-Ballistic Missile Treaty. Beforehand, Bush told reporters he
was looking forward to meeting ``Iggy.''
</P>
<P>
   In a notable contrast to the play for moderates from the hall,
Pat Robertson, at the Christian Coalition gathering earlier in the
day, delivered a rousing speech about the stakes in this election
for religious conservatives, focusing on the Supreme Court. ``Five
people can decide the destiny of unborn children,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``It looks as if two or three of those unelected officials are
getting ready to retire or go on up to that great court in the sky.
The next president is going to have the ability to select two or
three judges on the Supreme Court,'' he added, to cheers and
applause. ``We need to have the election of a man who will appoint
righteous judges to the court of the United States.''
</P>
<P>
   He added: ``I frankly agree with Ronald Reagan. I think we
should do away with the federal Department of Education.'' This, of
course, put him distinctly at odds with Bush, who fought hard
against that position in the platform process _ and prevailed.

DODGERS SALVAGE SPLIT
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By BRIAN DOHN  
 c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   PITTSBURGH _ The Dodgers needed this one. Losing a pair to the
last place Phillies was bad. Getting six hits in a 6-0 shutout loss
in the first game of a doubleheader against Pittsburgh was worse.
</P>
<P>
   Getting swept in the doubleheader by the Pirates would have been
catastrophic.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, the Dodgers rallied for three runs in the eighth inning
of the nightcap to beat the Pirates 5-3 and salvage a doubleheader
split at Three Rivers Stadium. It was the Dodgers' 35th
come-from-behind win this season but only the eighth time in 46
games they rallied from a deficit after the seventh inning to win.
</P>
<P>
   The Dodgers (56-50) conclude their 10-game road trip with an
afternoon game today. They're 5-4 on the trip so far.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were flat in the first game and struggling to score, so to
come from behind and win is big,'' said Dodgers closer Jeff Shaw,
who pitched a perfect ninth for the 150th save of his career.
``Now, it sets us up for the opportunity to win the series again.
Everybody thought we were dead when we lost the first game of the
series; now we have the opportunity to win the series again. That's
what we want to do, win each series.''
</P>
<P>
   The doldrums ended in the eighth inning of the second game when
the bottom of the order produced. Adrian Beltre and Alex Cora, who
combined for 11 RBI in a win last week in Colorado, were at it
again.
</P>
<P>
   Beltre, who hit a two-run homer in the fourth inning, doubled
home Shawn Green to tie it 3-3 with one out in the eighth. Beltre
has 14 RBI on the road trip. Cora then tripled in a pair of runs
off reliever Marc Wilkins to give the Dodgers a 5-3 lead. It was
more runs than the Dodgers combined to score in their previous four
games, three of which they lost.
</P>
<P>
   ``If (Beltre) didn't get a double, I was probably going to get
pinch-hit for there,'' Cora said. ``That's what I was thinking, and
I was like, `Please, get a double or something,' and it worked out
perfect.''
</P>
<P>
   Matt Herges (8-0), who pitched two innings in the first game,
recorded the win with a shutout inning in the second. He's the
first Dodgers pitcher to win eight straight since Pedro Martinez
did it in 1993.
</P>
<P>
   The second game also marked the first starts for recently
acquired right-hander Ismael Valdes and center fielder Tom Goodwin.
Valdes, who started Monday but was interrupted by rain after two
batters, threw 75 pitches in a solid four innings. He allowed a
two-run homer to John Vander Wal in the first inning, but that was
it. He struck out eight and walked three.
</P>
<P>
   Goodwin's start wasn't as pleasing. He followed his 9-for-73
(.123) slump in July by going 0 for 4 with three strikeouts and a
walk.
</P>
<P>
   ``(Valdes) showed me something going back-to-back, no rest and
coming back the next night,'' Dodgers manager Davey Johnson said.
``I've never really asked a guy to do that before. It's a first for
me, and the bullpen did a great job.''
</P>
<P>
   In the first game, the Dodgers looked much like the team that
got 17 hits in three games in Philadelphia. Gary Sheffield had a
pair of doubles, but otherwise the Dodgers were lethargic in
getting three other hits off Pirates lefty Jimmy Anderson (4-5) in
eight innings.
</P>
<P>
   In contrast, Dodgers lefty Carlos Perez allowed nine hits and
five runs in four innings. The Pirates had at least two hits in
each of the four innings and they scored in three of them. The
final blow was Alex Ramirez's two-run double with two out in the
fourth as the Pirates went ahead 5-0.
</P>
<P>
   ``With no disrespect to the Pirates and Phillies, but we know we
have to beat these teams up,'' Herges said. ``(Anderson) pitched
(guts) out both times against us, but last time we got into their
bullpen. He had our number big-time.
</P>
<P>
   ``I guess it is pretty upsetting. We have Philadelphia and
Pittsburgh, and then Milwaukee and Chicago. It's like, `Hey, you
guys have an easy schedule for here on out until September.' You
have to beat up on those teams. That's the way we feel. It is
frustrating.'' &QL;

FINDING SERIOUS POLITICAL DISCOURSE AMONG ALL THE ONLINE 
 ILLITERACY
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR; By VLAE KERSHNERc.2000 San Francisco Chronicle &QC;  &LR;
</P>
<P>
   It's not easy to find a decent political discussion on the Web.
</P>
<P>
   One of the Internet's biggest disappointments is that while it
is supposed to empower individuals to discuss issues seriously,
much of the discussion that really occurs is illiterate ranting.
</P>
<P>
   I hate to pick on  &UR; www.pseudo.com,  &LR; because its live cameras and
unscripted skybox conversations are the surprise hit of the
Republican convention. Still, its chatroom _ where webheads are
supposed to be able to converse with the talking heads in the
skybox _ is suffering from an intelligibility gap.
</P>
<P>
   This is a verbatim sample from Tuesday:
</P>
<P>
   &UR; _ I would like bush to get out of the u.n. &LR;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; _ good wish Dan, &LR;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; _ man that is just what i wanted to say media &LR;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; _ Isn't the us not being in the League of nations help Hitler &LR;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; _ Hitler ? &LR;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; _ If the us is not in the UN &LR;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; _ hitler? &LR;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; _ I was comenting on US getting out of the UN &LR;
</P>
<P>
   Someone is trying to make a point here _ withdrawal of the U.S.
from the United Nations could produce conditions similar to
American isolationism before World War II _ but it gets lost in the
cacophony of real-time chat.
</P>
<P>
   Quite different is a format called moderated chat, used
extensively by sites such as  &UR; www.aol.com  &LR; and
 &UR; www.washingtonpost.com.  &LR; Users' comments and questions are sent to
a moderator, who then decides what to post.
</P>
<P>
   Here's an example from ABC _  &UR; www.abcnews.go.com.  &LR; The guest is
Arizona Rep. Jim Kolbe, who Tuesday became the first openly gay
speaker at a Republican convention. The questioner is someone from
out on the web.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Questioner: ``As a gay man, why should I vote for a &LR; 
 &UR; conservative republican who can easily undo the small &LR; 
 &UR; protections that our community has worked so hard to achieve?'' &LR;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Kolbe: `'The Republican philosophy strongly promotes both &LR; 
 &UR; individual responsibility and individual freedom. It is because &LR; 
 &UR; of this philosophy that I have remained a Republican, even &LR; 
 &UR; though I may agree with some of the positions taken by the &LR; 
 &UR; party.'' &LR;
</P>
<P>
   Notice that Kolbe said ``agree'' when he obviously meant to say
``disagree.'' This is still chat, and it's a little rough.
</P>
<P>
   Still, if you want a serious discussion, the moderated chat
format is light years ahead.
</P>
<P>
   A NON-DEBATABLE ISSUE: You can participate in all sorts of polls
on the web, but are there any that mean anything? Well, maybe.
</P>
<P>
   The Commission on Presidential Debates _  &UR; www.debates.org  &LR; _ is
conducting a survey on what the format and topics for the
presidential debates should be, and promises to forward the results
to the moderator of the debates.
</P>
<P>
   But _ boo, hiss _ the survey doesn't ask the most important
question _ which candidates should be allowed to debate. The
commission has already decided that only candidates with 15 percent
in the polls should be included, which means only George Bush and
Al Gore.
</P>
<P>
   So, if you're a fan of Ralph Nader or some other third-party
candidate, there's no way to get your message across.
</P>
<P>
   EMAIL FOR EMIL: Remember John Chancellor and the other old-time
floor reporters for the TV networks, going around to the
delegations, asking questions and gathering anecdotes?
</P>
<P>
   Emil Guillermo, the veteran Bay Area journalist, is doing that
type of shoe-leather reporting for  &UR; www.grassroots.com. &LR;
</P>
<P>
   He couldn't quite hide the skepticism in his voice when he asked
a Latino delegate from Texas why Latinos should support the party
that was behind California's controversial anti-immigration ballot
measure, Prop. 187. The Texan didn't seem to know what he was
talking about.

CAMPBELL GOES `EDGY' FOR KID VOTE
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     By CARLA MARINUCCI 
 &HT;     c.2000 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHILADELPHIA _ The ``Rage Against the Machine`' political
candidate now has a commercial to appeal to the MTV crowd.
</P>
<P>
   That's South Bay Rep. Tom Campbell, candidate for U.S. Senate,
who showed off new spots here Tuesday that are running on MTV and
Comedy Central.
</P>
<P>
   ``Edgy'' is how Campbell ad consultant Roy Fletcher described
them. That means fast cuts, lots of black and white, with a
high-tech feel.
</P>
<P>
   And he's being interviewed by the MTV ``Choose or Lose'' people
in Philadelphia.
</P>
<P>
   What's up with that? This is a Republican political campaign.
</P>
<P>
   And hey, there's the tech-loving candidate, sitting at a
computer, e-mailing his Stanford students, telling young newcomers
to the political process, ``Check it out.''
</P>
<P>
   Campbell's campaign pointed out that the candidate is a college
professor. And he does have a connection to the youth vote.
</P>
<P>
   ``I haven't seen Sen. (Dianne) Feinstein jogging into youth
events,'' said Sean Walsh, Campbell's spokesman.
</P>
<P>
   Ouch.
</P>
<P>
   Campbell's campaign manager can speak with authority on what
appeals to the youth voters. Andrea Jones, who is running the
Campbell show, turned 23 Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   The issues that most young voters care about ``are not issues
you guys would ever write about,'' she told reporters. Those are
things like violence in the schools, paying for education, and,
``How am I going to make money after college?''
</P>
<P>
   Traditional politicians _ not in Philadelphia _ aren't speaking
to those themes.
</P>
<P>
   So that's why Campbell's new ad is one of three spots that tout
his independence.
</P>
<P>
   It may be tough for California viewers even to get a peek at
these ads. Campbell doesn't have a lot of money to spread around on
commercial time _ just $250,000, enough for about one spot on
network television.
</P>
<P>
   But he's hoping that through the media and coverage here, he'll
get out the message: Campbell the maverick.
</P>
<P>
   The ads mention the congressman's leadership and his commitment
to education and fiscal responsibility.
</P>
<P>
   They also do not mention the ``R'' word. Never is Campbell's
identification with the Grand Old Party made explicit.
</P>
<P>
   ``The script correctly portrays who I am,'' said Campbell, who
was quick to add that he is ``proud of my Republicanism.'' Did he
believe a connection with the GOP is a liability? ``No, I don't
think so,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The real reason? The all-important swing and independent voters,
some of them first-time voters _ the kind of folks who gravitated
to Arizona Sen. John McCain in the presidential race _ are the
power brokers in this election.
</P>
<P>
   So Campbell enlisted McCain _ whom he didn't endorse in the
primary _ for one spot that was to air last night during McCain's
keynote speech to the convention.
</P>
<P>
   ``Tom Campbell's a fighter,'' the Arizona senator says, ``a
maverick like me.''
</P>
<P>
   The commercial ends with McCain saying, ``Tom believes in an
America where special interests don't run the country. You do.''
</P>
<P>
   Another spot touts Campbell's experience and life story.
</P>
<P>
   ``Educated in some of our nation's finest universities, for 17
years Tom Campbell has made a personal commitment to educational
excellence as a teacher,'' says the announcer. He calls Campbell
``a leader for a new generation, not a politician for the next
election.''
</P>
<P>
   The third ad is the MTV spot.
</P>
<P>
   The music, said Campbell ad man Fletcher, ``is a little bit like
Depeche Mode.''
</P>
<P>
   Ouch again.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe he didn't understand that's a group old enough to be
familiar to most reporters covering the campaign. We're talking
prehistoric.
</P>
<P>
   Tom Campbell, if he wants to be real edgy, needs to get out that
``Rage Against the Machine'` track: ``More (money) for Gore or the
son of a drug lord. F_ it. Cut the cord.''
</P>
<P>
   Then again, maybe that won't play, especially in Philadelphia.

DON'T BLAME RANGERS GM; HE HAD NOTHING TO TRADE
</HEADLINE>

<P>
   ARLINGTON, Texas _ You'll find no white flag atop the pole at
The Ballpark in Arlington this week.
</P>
<P>
   Don't need one. The Texas Rangers' acceptance of their season's
fate should be obvious, despite the outcry that general manager
Doug Melvin should do something dramatic, like sign a surrender on
the deck of the USS Missouri, or something.
</P>
<P>
   Barring a freak and sudden alignment of the planets, the Rangers
are not playoff-bound this season. Reasons abound, not the least of
which is that the all-world catcher was injured last week and is
lost for the season.
</P>
<P>
   But even before that, these Rangers lacked that certain ``je ne
sais quoi,'' which is French for ``dependable pitching.''
</P>
<P>
   Don't you think Melvin saw that?
</P>
<P>
   ``What good does it do by announcing that the season is over?''
Melvin asked before Tuesday night's 4-3 loss to the Chicago White
Sox. ``I don't understand what that does, besides killing morale.''
</P>
<P>
   Melvin is being rebuked in public print and on the radio talk
shows for seemingly standing pat, while more emboldened general
managers wheeled and dealed around him.
</P>
<P>
   Yes, the Arizona Diamondbacks were able to trade for the widely
exalted Curt Schilling. But it cost them, among others, their
once-No. 1 starter, Omar Daal.
</P>
<P>
   Yes, the Atlanta Braves added pitcher Andy Ashby. But Ashby cost
the Braves one of their most promising young arms in Bruce Chen.
</P>
<P>
   And, yes, the Los Angeles Dodgers made their pennant push by
trading for ... Tom Goodwin?
</P>
<P>
   Oh, puh-leese. Even in accommodating Coors Field, Goodwin's
average was plunging like a rock.
</P>
<P>
   And the team at the top of the AL West, the Seattle Mariners,
made its big trade-deadline move by acquiring outfielder Al Martin.
Yawn.
</P>
<P>
   The point is, none of these are deals that the Rangers either
wanted or were in a position to make. Melvin had neither a Daal nor
a Chen to offer, and somebody needs to explain to me where a
Martin, a Rondell White or a B.J. Surhoff would have fit in.
</P>
<P>
   In the end, Melvin had bullpen closer John Wetteland, and that
was it, unless the general manager wanted to take the vastly
unpopular step of shopping left fielder Rusty Greer.
</P>
<P>
   In hindsight, Melvin's sin likely was in not trading Wetteland
in early June, right after the pitcher was coming off a month in
which he had a major-league-leading 11 saves. In early June,
however, the Rangers were still on the high side of the .500 mark.
They thought they could still find a higher gear and win the
division.
</P>
<P>
   Scold Melvin for his optimism. But while you're at it, tell me
which of the disappointing relievers would have been closing games
for the rest of this season.
</P>
<P>
   With the trade deadline staring him in the face last weekend,
Melvin simply decided that the best deal for Wetteland _ for now _
was no deal.
</P>
<P>
   Oakland GM Billy Beane woofed about Melvin stiffing him on a
packaged Wetteland-David Segui trade. But Beane reportedly never
offered the prospect that the Rangers wanted, pitching prospect
Jesus Colome, and the other piece of the Oakland offer was Matt
Stairs.
</P>
<P>
   Matt Stairs?
</P>
<P>
   At the annual late-July poker game, in other words, some teams
always seem to hold the cards. The Braves and Yankees seldom deem
themselves to be more than a player or two away. Their farm systems
have enabled them to proceed accordingly.
</P>
<P>
   The Rangers enjoy no such luxury. The young pitching arms in the
system _ Tuesday night's starter Ryan Glynn, for instance _ are
mostly all in Arlington these days, trying to earn permanent
big-league jobs.
</P>
<P>
   Melvin's trade-bait bucket was largely empty.
</P>
<P>
   Scouts have been watching the Rangers for weeks. The failure to
close a deal for Wetteland may say more about the kind of
inconsistent season that he has had _ Tuesday night being another
example _ than it does about Melvin.
</P>
<P>
   The alarmists' view is that it's time to break up the Rangers
and begin anew. But let me suggest again that that was done last
November, when two-time MVP Juan Gonzalez was traded.
</P>
<P>
   Given his diminished options, Melvin decided this week not to
give John Wetteland away. Some of us have no problem with that.
</P>
<P>
   No further dramatic gestures or flags of surrender are
necessary. Don't criticize Melvin for realizing that. nn

WHITE-HOT ASCENT: '97 SURRENDER BEGAN SOX TURNAROUND
</HEADLINE>
 SOX-TURNAROUND-TEX (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By SIMON GONZALEZ 
c.2000 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   ARLINGTON, Texas _ Frank Thomas is in a good mood. The big
slugger isn't always the friendliest guy in the game, but on this
day he's smiling and almost jovial.
</P>
<P>
   And why not?
</P>
<P>
   Thomas is having a superb season, the Chicago White Sox have the
best record in the American League and an 111/2-game lead, after
Tuesday night, over the second-place Cleveland Indians in the AL
Central, and general manager Ron Schueler strengthened the team by
trading for catcher Charles Johnson and designated hitter Harold
Baines on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's definitely a positive trade,'' Thomas said before the
White Sox defeated the Texas Rangers, 4-3, Tuesday night at The
Ballpark in Arlington.
</P>
<P>
   Thomas was not in a good mood this time three years ago. There
were no smiles then, only scowls.
</P>
<P>
   The White Sox were 31/2 games behind the Cleveland Indians at
the trading deadline in 1997, but instead of strengthening the team
Schueler traded away Roberto Hernandez, Wilson Alvarez and Danny
Darwin in the infamous ``White Flag'' trade.
</P>
<P>
   Thomas made no secret of his displeasure at the time.
</P>
<P>
   ``We always want to win,'' Thomas said. ``That's what we play
the game for. At the time it was something that was painful. It
wasn't cool.''
</P>
<P>
   It's easy to smile now because the White Sox are winning in
large part because of that trade.
</P>
<P>
   Three of the prospects acquired in the deal, Keith Foulke, Bobby
Howry and Lorenzo Barcelo, are in the White Sox bullpen, but the
impact of the trade goes beyond that.
</P>
<P>
   It signaled a new direction for the team. The White Sox would
rebuild with youth, and suffer the short-term consequences for the
promise of long-term gains. Manager Jerry Manuel was hired before
the '98 season, and was allowed to concentrate on development and
not results.
</P>
<P>
   Young players like Magglio Ordonez, Paul Konerko and Carlos Lee,
and pitchers Mike Sirotka, Jim Parque, Howry and Foulke were able
to grow in a pressure-free environment. Along with Thomas, Ray
Durham and James Baldwin, they form the nucleus of the best team in
the league.
</P>
<P>
   ``No one thought that trade was going to benefit us the way it
did,'' Thomas said. ``We got over it, and the organization grew. I
think we're better now, and we'll let bygones be bygones. I'm just
happy it worked out for us.''
</P>
<P>
   With two months left in the season and a playoff berth firmly
within their grasp, it's easy to say it worked out. Going into the
season, there still were doubts.
</P>
<P>
   The Indians, Central champions since the division played its
first season to a finish in '95, once again were the heavy
favorites. The White Sox, who finished second even though they were
a game under .500 in '99, were supposed to be pushed by the Detroit
Tigers and Kansas City Royals, according to conventional wisdom.
</P>
<P>
   But if those outside the clubhouse doubted, those inside were
quietly confident.
</P>
<P>
   ``We realistically thought we could compete in this division,
and at the very least the wild card,'' Konerko said. ``Obviously
we're doing better. But we really thought we'd be in the divisional
race all year.''
</P>
<P>
   They're better because Ordonez, Konerko and Lee continue to
improve; because Baldwin, Sirotka and Parque had combined for 30
victories before Baldwin's start against the Rangers on Tuesday,
two fewer than they had all of last season; and because Thomas once
again is one of the most feared hitters in the game.
</P>
<P>
   There were whispers that the one-time superstar might be
finished after he hit .265 in '98 and had a career-low 15 homers
last year, but he came to Arlington with a .333 average, 29 homers
and 91 runs batted in. He's in the top 10 in the league in all
three categories.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think people overlooked the type teams I played for the last
couple of years,'' he said. ``There were a lot of young kids, a lot
of growing, and when you've got a veteran player in the mix of all
that, it's a little different. And last year I wasn't healthy. Now
I'm healthy, and I'm playing good baseball. It's not like I lost
interest or lost talent. I'm doing the things I've always done. I'm
just healthy again and I'm able to do it on a team that's
winning.''
</P>
<P>
   The Sox haven't been winning as much lately. They had lost seven
of their past 11 games before Tuesday night. But it hasn't
mattered. They still had a double-digit lead over the Indians.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's beautiful, because we've played bad and haven't lost any
ground,'' Konerko said. ``We're not going to play bad forever.
Everybody wants to get down on us, but you're going to go through
bad spurts. The fact that we haven't really lost any ground, that
just tells me more it's our year.''
</P>
<P>
   The trade for Johnson and Baines shows that the White Sox are
serious about continuing to win.
</P>
<P>
   Schueler also wanted to add a pitcher with Cal Eldred (10-2) out
indefinitely because of a nerve problem in his elbow, but the
asking price was too high. That could be a potential problem in the
playoffs.
</P>
<P>
   Still, it shows how far the White Sox have come in three years
that their biggest worry is pitching matchups in the postseason.
</P>
<P>
   No wonder Thomas is smiling. nn

RANGERS PLACE DARREN OLIVER ON DISABLED LIST
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By T.R. SULLIVAN 
c.2000 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   ARLINGTON, Texas _ The Texas Rangers placed pitcher Darren
Oliver on the disabled list Tuesday with fatigue in his left
shoulder and have moved Doug Davis into the rotation. Oliver, on
the disabled list for the second time this season, is scheduled to
have his shoulder examined by Anaheim Angels team physician Lewis
Yocum on Friday.
</P>
<P>
   The Rangers want Yocum to examine him to make sure the injury is
not anything more serious than fatigue. If Yocum confirms the
Rangers' diagnosis, Oliver is likely to end up at Triple-A Oklahoma
on medical-rehabilitation assignment.
</P>
<P>
   ``I knew I couldn't start him any more, and I couldn't count on
him in the bullpen,'' Rangers manager Johnny Oates said. ``There's
just no way for him to work out of this. The first thing is to make
sure it's nothing physical.''
</P>
<P>
   Oliver is 0-2 with an 11.57 earned-run average in three starts
since coming off the disabled list July 20.
</P>
<P>
   The Rangers now have three pitchers in the starting rotation
with less than 11/2 years of major-league service: Davis, Ryan
Glynn and Matt Perisho. None of them were in the rotation at the
start of the season.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've got a chance to see what these guys can do,'' Oates
said. ``At the same time, I think our starting pitching is as good
as it has been all year.''
</P>
<P>
   The Rangers recalled right-hander Jonathan Johnson from Triple-A
Oklahoma to replace Oliver on the roster. That leaves Mike Venafro
as the only left-hander in the bullpen. SCOUTING DIRECTOR RESIGNS
</P>
<P>
   Scouting director Chuck McMichael, who has overseen the Rangers'
past three drafts, resigned Tuesday to pursue other opportunities.
The job of scouting director has many supervising duties, and
McMichael said he would like to get back to his roots as a talent
evaluator.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have no regrets being a scouting director; I enjoyed that
part,'' McMichael said. ``But that takes you away from the dirt and
the grass and the ballpark. I miss that part, especially without
the cellphone ringing in your ear every minute. I admit it: I was
born in a dugout.''
</P>
<P>
   McMichael's most-significant draft picks were Tulsa first
baseman Carlos Pena and second baseman Jason Romano, two highly
regarded prospects.
</P>
<P>
   General manager Doug Melvin said he would like to fill the
position quickly and will likely replace McMichael with one of the
Rangers' three national amateur scouts: Tim Hallgren, Dave
Klipstein or Jeff Taylor. MISSING LOAIZA
</P>
<P>
   The Rangers won't face former teammate Esteban Loaiza this
weekend in Toronto. Loaiza was scheduled to pitch Sunday against
the Rangers, but that changed after the Blue Jays acquired Steve
Trachsel from Tampa Bay.
</P>
<P>
   Trachsel is scheduled to pitch against the Rangers on Friday and
Kelvim Escobar is being pushed back to Sunday. Loaiza, traded to
the Blue Jays two weeks ago, is still in the rotation but is
scheduled to pitch Monday against the Kansas City Royals. KAPLER
EXTENDS STREAK
</P>
<P>
   Gabe Kapler waited until his final at-bat, but he extended his
hitting streak to 15 games with a two-run single to left field in
the eighth inning.
</P>
<P>
   The streak is the Rangers' longest this season, and their
longest since Todd Zeile's 17-game streak from June 21-July 10 last
year.
</P>
<P>
   However, Kapler's streak of games with at least one extra-base
hit ended at seven, one short of the club record set by Ruben
Sierra in 1990. BRIEFLY
</P>
<P>
   _ Rick Helling is the Rangers' Player of the Month for July.
Helling went 4-0 with a 3.12 ERA in six starts.
</P>
<P>
   _ John and Michele Wetteland have a new son. Michele gave birth
to Jake David on Monday. J.D. is the Wetteland's third child.
</P>
<P>
   _ Darwin Cubillan, the right-handed reliever acquired from the
Toronto Blue Jays in the Esteban Loaiza trade, has pitched 102/3
scoreless innings for the Triple-A Oklahoma RedHawks, giving up
only four hits, walking three and striking out eight. nn

COWBOYS' TOP PICK BACKPEDALING ON DEPTH CHART
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By RAY BUCK 
c.2000 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   IRVING, Texas _ In roughly three months, Dwayne Goodrich has
gone from being the first of three rookie cornerbacks drafted by
the Dallas Cowboys to playing behind the other two, Kareem
Larrimore and Mario Edwards.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't really get frustrated,'' Goodrich said Tuesday at
Valley Ranch, where the Cowboys held double practices before
heading for Tokyo on Wednesday for Saturday's American Bowl. ``The
other two guys are just picking up on what we're doing a little
quicker than I am. I just eventually have to come around sooner or
later, I know that.''
</P>
<P>
   While Goodrich _ second-round pick, sixth cornerback taken
overall _ finds a way to keep his pride in check, the Cowboys'
coaching staff is trying to deflect attention from a pecking order
that has gone awry.
</P>
<P>
   Larrimore and Edwards, despite being picked in the fourth and
sixth rounds, respectively, are on the second team and playing more
against slot receivers in nickel packages than the third-string
Goodrich.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a new system for me,'' said Goodrich, who started on a
national championship team at Tennessee as a junior. ``In college,
you would have coaches who gave you what to do, then you did it
whatever way you felt comfortable in doing it. Here, you do it
Zim's way.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Zim'' is Mike Zimmer, the Cowboys' first-year defensive
coordinator and former secondary coach. Zimmer is extremely
passionate and vocal in his coaching style and isn't afraid to chew
out a player who makes a mistake or praise another who makes a good
play.
</P>
<P>
   Goodrich ``had three or four really good practices in Wichita
Falls and was just starting to get his confidence back,'' Zimmer
said. ``Unfortunately, he has kind of been slacking in the last
couple of practices, so now we're trying to get him back.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Slacking'' might be an apt description for what happened on a
slant pass completed to Goodrich's side in team drills Tuesday.
Free safety Jason Kaiser followed the receiver through a group of
idle players watching practice and tried to strip the ball.
Goodrich immediately pulled up after the catch.
</P>
<P>
   Goodrich remembers the play but apparently didn't think twice
about it, saying he always tries his hardest. But because he is the
Cowboys' top draft pick, he is beginning to realize that he will be
more closely scrutinized by fans and media.
</P>
<P>
   And it doesn't help Goodrich that the general perception is that
he has fallen behind.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm trying to get to where I can go out there and feel
comfortable, and not have to second-guess myself,'' said Goodrich,
who achieved a degree of self-satisfaction with his play on kickoff
coverage Sunday night in the preseason opener against Pittsburgh.
``I went out there to fly around and make a few plays.''
</P>
<P>
   When Edwards was asked about his first game in the NFL, he shook
his head and said, ``I'm focusing on the next game, not the last
game. That's why the Lord put eyes in the front of our head, not in
the back.''
</P>
<P>
   Neither Edwards nor Larrimore, who broke a bone in his right
hand against the Steelers on a corner blitz, was overly impressive
in the Cowboys' 38-10 loss on Sunday. Edwards was penalized for
pass interference in the end zone, a call that led to Pittsburgh's
first touchdown.
</P>
<P>
   But both will line up at cornerback with the second team when
the Cowboys face Atlanta on Saturday night at the Tokyo Dome.
</P>
<P>
   Zimmer holds firm to his conviction that he didn't see Sunday's
loss as a total meltdown by his young cornerbacks.
</P>
<P>
   ``Most of the time, they were in position,'' he said. ``They
just didn't make plays.''
</P>
<P>
   One exception, Zimmer said, is that Goodrich could have been in
better position against the Steelers' 6-foot-5 rookie Plaxico
Burress on a 2-yard ``fade route'' touchdown in the second quarter.
Goodrich earlier missed a tackle on a hitch to Burress that went
for 24 yards.
</P>
<P>
   ``When a (cornerback) gets completely beaten on a post or on an
out, that's what worries me. That didn't happen in this game,''
Zimmer said. ``I'm a lot more encouraged than maybe some other
people were. It wasn't like, `Wow, our corners got lit up.' To me,
that's important.''
</P>
<P>
   It's also important that the Cowboys' rookie cornerbacks don't
become too much of a story right now. nn

NOT EVEN DISRUPTIVE TRIP CAN RUFFLE COWBOYS COACH
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By CLARENCE E. HILL JR. 
c.2000 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   IRVING, Texas _ Some people might look at the Dallas Cowboys'
trip to Japan for the American Bowl game against the Atlanta
Falcons on Saturday as a nuisance.
</P>
<P>
   The Cowboys, who depart Wednesday on a 14-hour flight to Tokyo,
are robbed of two days of practice. And even though they will
practice one day in Tokyo, the tours and other marketing functions
they must attend to promote the NFL in Japan will surely be
distractions.
</P>
<P>
   Considering this is his first year as head coach, Dave Campo
would love to have the camp time to keep the focus on football. But
he knows the Cowboys, who are already set to play abroad the next
few years, aren't just any team. As a result, the team is given
special opportunities and responsibilities.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is something we will do and I like being a part of
that,'' Campo said. ``This is a special organization, no matter the
circumstances, whether they are good or bad.''
</P>
<P>
   Campo said he prefers all that comes with being part of the
Cowboys' organization and has impressed that thought on his
players.
</P>
<P>
   As for the game, Campo said he wants to see a good showing from
the first-team units on offense and defense. He also wants to see a
lot of the young players on the offensive line and in the
secondary.
</P>
<P>
   TWO PLAYERS ADDED
</P>
<P>
   The Cowboys made several roster moves Tuesday, topped by placing
tight end Mike Lucky on injured reserve. Lucky underwent surgery to
reconstruct three torn ligaments in his right knee.
</P>
<P>
   Safety Sean Key, who underwent surgery Tuesday to repair the
fractured tibia and fibula in his right leg, also was placed on
injured reserve. The team also reached an injury settlement and
released rookie free-agent guard James Tenner, who fractured his
wrist in practice last week.
</P>
<P>
   The Cowboys used two of the open spots to shore up their
depleted offensive-line corps, which is without starters Larry
Allen (fractured wrist) and Erik Williams (holdout/retired). Guard
Steve Scifres, the team's 1997 third-round pick, was brought back
along with former Oklahoma guard J.R. Konrad.
</P>
<P>
   The Cowboys, who already had one open roster spot, now have two,
one of which will surely be used for a blocking tight end to
replace Lucky. In the interim, the Cowboys are planning to use
guard Michael Lies as a blocking tight end in two- and
three-tight-end situations.
</P>
<P>
   ``That position is blocker first and receiver second,'' Dave
Campo said.
</P>
<P>
   The Cowboys resisted using defensive end Ebenezer Ekuban as an
emergency tight end. Ekuban, who played tight end in college, was
used as a tight end briefly last year under similar circumstances.
Campo, however, said that Ekuban's development at defensive end is
too important to split his time. Ekuban is the expected starter at
left end.
</P>
<P>
   ``He needs too much work at defensive end,'' Campo said. SMITH,
WARREN RETURN TO PRACTICE
</P>
<P>
   Cowboys running back Emmitt Smith (sprained toe) and safety
George Teague (strained gluteus) returned to practice Tuesday after
missing much of the past week, including Sunday's preseason loss to
the Steelers.
</P>
<P>
   Both players are expected to play Saturday against the Falcons
in the American Bowl in Tokyo. Dave Campo said he will wait a few
days before making a decision. nn

MAVS SIGN DAVIS, TRENT, THEN FOCUS ON KEEPING BUCKNER
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By ARTHUR GARCIA 
c.2000 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   DALLAS _ The NBA's free-agent signing period began Tuesday, and
the Mavericks wasted little time in ensuring the return of Hubert
Davis and Gary Trent.
</P>
<P>
   Davis, a reserve guard and the NBA's 3-point percentage leader
last season, signed a four-year contract believed to be worth at
least $10 million. Trent, likely the starting power forward heading
into the season, signed a one-year deal for $2.4 million.
</P>
<P>
   ``That was our plan all along,'' Mavs coach/general manager Don
Nelson said regarding the signings of Davis and Trent. ``We're
happy we got it done.''
</P>
<P>
   With Trent and Davis signed, the Mavs' attention turned to
restricted free agent Greg Buckner and finding a backup center.
Buckner is expected to sign a three-year, $2.5 million offer with
Vancouver, a deal the Mavs can match to keep the second-year guard.
</P>
<P>
   Mavs owner Mark Cuban and Nelson have said they plan to match
the offer. Buckner and his agent, Steve Kauffman, however, would
prefer that didn't happen.
</P>
<P>
   ``Maybe Cuban and Nelson will have some compassion for this kid,
look at him as a human being and say, `You've served us well, we're
overloaded at guard, we'll let you go,''' Grizzlies president Dick
Versace told the ``Vancouver Sun'' Tuesday night.
</P>
<P>
   Versace said he was unsure when the Grizzlies would officially
make the offer to Buckner, leaving the Mavs 15 days to match.
Nelson said Versace's plea won't affect the Mavs' plans for
Buckner, who played a key role in the Mavs' strong late-season
finish.
</P>
<P>
   ``Who cares what Dick Versace says,'' Nelson said. ``That has
nothing to do with anything. We're going to re-sign (Buckner).''
</P>
<P>
   Re-signing Buckner means the Mavs would likely carry five guards
into the season, and Kauffman has said that his client doesn't
believe there are enough minutes to go around.
</P>
<P>
   Kauffman said the Mavs offered Buckner a two-year deal starting
at the NBA minimum, an offer that was quickly rejected. Kauffman
said the Mavs' plan to match Vancouver's offer has made for an
``uncomfortable situation'' for Buckner.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was so low-balled by the Dallas Mavericks and that left a
very bad taste in his mouth,'' Kauffman said Tuesday night.
</P>
<P>
   Kauffman has maintained that Buckner enjoyed his first season
with the Mavs, but his career would be better served in Vancouver
because he would probably be the third guard.
</P>
<P>
   The Mavs also remain in the market for a backup to starting
center Shawn Bradley. Offering the Mavs' $2.25 million exception,
Cuban and Nelson hope to find a big man as the free-agent market
settles out.
</P>
<P>
   Nelson said ``there's no timetable'' on signing a backup.
</P>
<P>
   Davis had considered offers from other teams, starting as high
as $3.5 million per season, before coming to terms with the Mavs.
Though the Mavs' contract averages out to at least $2.5 million a
year, Kauffman, who is Davis' agent, said last week the security of
a four-year deal and Davis' preference to remain with the Mavs
sealed his return.
</P>
<P>
   Trent, who missed most of last season nursing injuries, has
positioned himself to sign a much larger contract with the team
next summer. The Mavs are expected to have at least $15 million in
salary-cap room in 2001. nn

NASCAR IMPOSES SAFETY DEVICE AFTER FATALITIES
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JOHN STURBIN 
c.2000 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   FORT WORTH, Texas _ Responding to the crashes that killed Adam
Petty and Kenny Irwin Jr., NASCAR has mandated two measures to help
prevent carburetor throttles from hanging up while at speed.
</P>
<P>
   NASCAR officials issued a technical bulletin Tuesday requiring
Winston Cup teams to install a stop on the car's primary and
secondary throttle shafts, and an on/off ``kill switch'' on the
steering wheel within reach of the driver's thumb to cut power to
the ignition.
</P>
<P>
   The modifications are scheduled to take effect with the opening
of practice Thursday morning for Saturday's Brickyard 400 at the
Indianapolis Motor Speedway.
</P>
<P>
   ``In trying to find something effective across the board, these
were two areas that were easily done and could be done before this
weekend,'' said Kevin Triplett, director of operations for NASCAR.
</P>
<P>
   Triplett said the changes were being implemented despite the
fact that the sanctioning body has been unable to establish that
hung throttles caused the fatal crashes in the Turn 3 area of New
Hampshire International Speedway.
</P>
<P>
   Petty, 19, the first fourth-generation athlete in any sport, was
killed while practicing his Busch Grand National car May 12. Irwin,
30, was killed while practicing his Cup car July 7, not far from
where Petty crashed on the relatively flat 1.059-mile oval in
Loudon, N.H.
</P>
<P>
   ``The work we did _ the investigations _ we didn't find anything
conclusive,'' said Triplett, referring to the widely held theory
that the throttles hung open on both drivers and took them straight
into the concrete wall. ``As we continue to go through things and
talk to people to try to piece things together ... it's difficult
to recreate what happened because of damage to this piece of the
car and that part of the car.
</P>
<P>
   ``Through our talks with crew chiefs and drivers and car owners,
this is an area we felt like something could be done. We hope this
is a step in that direction.''
</P>
<P>
   Cup cars are equipped with an on/off switch on their dashboard.
Triplett said many teams already were using a throttle stop on
their carburetor assembly to prevent the rod that controls the
throttle from going past the point where it can hang open.
</P>
<P>
   ``The auxiliary ignition switch on the steering wheel is
something we added,'' Triplett said. ``That's where the driver's
hands are already. Instead of creating another thing for the driver
to take his hands off the wheel for, there's a switch where his
hand is already located.''
</P>
<P>
   Triplett said the idea of installing a toe clip to help a driver
free up a hung throttle also was considered.
</P>
<P>
   ``The feedback we got from that was there's a point in time
where the toe clip is not effective,'' Triplett said. ``And
honestly, some drivers were comfortable with it, some weren't.''
</P>
<P>
   Cup regular Jeremy Mayfield applauded the new rules.
</P>
<P>
   ``These are changes I can't see anybody disagreeing with,'' said
Mayfield, driver of the No. 12 Mobil 1 Ford Taurus. ``They don't
take anything away from the race cars. They don't affect
competition, but they can save you from a pretty hard crash.
</P>
<P>
   ``Let's face it _ it's not how fast you go, it's how fast you
stop. If you have more time when you're having problems ... to
correct a little bit, then this is a good thing. Even if you hit at
a better angle, then that's got to be good, too.''
</P>
<P>
   Mike Helton, NASCAR's senior vice president and chief operating
officer, said the sanctioning body also is studying the HANS Device
used by drivers in the open-wheel Championship Auto Racing Teams
Series. The device is a collar designed to prevent the head and
neck from snapping violently forward and backward during a crash.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've had drivers practice and test with them,'' said Helton,
who added that any design fitted into a Cup car would need to be
different than that used in CART.
</P>
<P>
   Triplett also said NASCAR has been presented ideas for
energy-absorbing ``soft walls'' on its oval tracks.
</P>
<P>
   ``But a lot of things we've been presented with are still just
ideas,'' Triplett said. ``They're not in place anywhere. They're
ideas on a drawing board or in a brochure. There may be something
out there, and it may be ``the'' thing. Or maybe we haven't seen it
yet.'' nn

RANGERS' CURTIS, MARTINEZ WANTED TRADE
</HEADLINE>
 TRADE-TEX (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By T.R. SULLIVAN 
c.2000 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   ARLINGTON, Texas _ Chad Curtis has the right to demand a trade.
His intention was not to exercise that option. His present
circumstances have forced him to change his thinking.
</P>
<P>
   Both Curtis and Dave Martinez were admittedly disappointed when
the Texas Rangers didn't trade them before the non-waiver trading
deadline expired Monday. The two were platooning in right field
until the Rangers acquired Ricky Ledee from the Cleveland Indians
last week for designated hitter David Segui but now see their
playing time decreasing.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was hoping that if another club could use me, I'd be
traded,'' Curtis said. ``But I know there's no guarantee going
somewhere else would have been a better situation than here.''
</P>
<P>
   He may try to find out. Curtis is signed through next season,
the final year on a three-year contract he signed with the New York
Yankees. The Rangers acquired him in the off-season and because he
was traded in the middle of a multi-year contract he has the right
to demand a trade at the end of the season.
</P>
<P>
   If he does and the Rangers fail to comply by spring training, he
can become a free agent.
</P>
<P>
   ``That would be an option,'' Curtis said. ``When I hear a player
doing that, I look at it as them whining or complaining. I don't
want to get into that. But you look at the situation, if you're not
being used and you think you could be used somewhere else, I'd
rather explore that option.''
</P>
<P>
   Curtis said, ``I'll sit on the bench for a winning team and I'll
play for a losing team. But I don't think I should be sitting on
the bench for a losing team. That's what I'll base my decision on
at the end of the year.''
</P>
<P>
   Manager Johnny Oates said Ledee will play a lot of right field.
He said Curtis will also play right field.
</P>
<P>
   ``They'll both play but how much I don't know,'' Oates said.
</P>
<P>
   Said general manager Doug Melvin, ``Chad will get enough
at-bats. The DH is not going to be filled strictly by one person.
If Chad was traded somewhere else, he probably wouldn't see any
more at-bats.''
</P>
<P>
   Because Curtis is a right-handed hitter, he could spell both
Ledee and designated hitter Frank Catalanotto, who are left-handed
hitters. But Martinez is also left-handed and was playing against
right-handed pitchers. His playing time is likely to be the most
severely affected, which is why he was hoping the Rangers might
trade him.
</P>
<P>
   ``If I'm not going to play here, I'd like to go somewhere
else,'' Martinez said. ``If I'm in the lineup, I'll just do the
best I can. If I'm not in the lineup, I know it's not because of
something I did. I think I've played pretty good.''
</P>
<P>
   This is Martinez's 15th year in the major leagues and he has
never been in postseason play. Melvin said if a contending team
wants Martinez, he won't stand in his way and a trade would likely
happen.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can see Dave's situation,'' Melvin said. ``He hasn't been in
postseason. He came over here thinking we'd be in contention and
that's when we fell off.''
</P>
<P>
   But Melvin added, ``If they're worried about Ricky Ledee, then
we've got a pretty good player.''

ORIOLES' DEALS SIGNAL BEGINNING OF REBUILDING PHASE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By SIMON GONZALEZ 
c.2000 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   This year's Trading Frenzy Award _ a gold-plated cellphone
mounted on a marble base _ goes to the Baltimore Orioles.
</P>
<P>
   In four frenetic days, the Orioles traded their All-Star
shortstop, their should-have-been-an-All-Star catcher, their former
All-Star first baseman, their former All-Star left fielder, their
former All-Star designated hitter, and their closer.
</P>
<P>
   We can only assume there were no takers for Cal Ripken Jr.,
Albert Belle, Brady Anderson and Delino DeShields. Or perhaps
general manager Syd Thrift just ran out of time.
</P>
<P>
   Program sellers should be doing a brisk business at Camden Yards
today, because it truly will be difficult to recognize the players
without one.
</P>
<P>
   When the dust settled after blowing up the team, the Orioles
definitely were younger and cheaper. No longer are they the poster
boys for the overpaying, underachieving big-market teams.
</P>
<P>
   It's quite a contrast to 1996, when the Orioles set the course
for their future with a couple of trades they didn't make.
</P>
<P>
   Then-GM Pat Gillick had deals in place to trade Bobby Bonilla
and David Wells. Wells could have gone to Cleveland in a package
for pitchers Bartolo Colon and Albie Lopez and outfielder Brian
Giles.
</P>
<P>
   But owner Peter Angelos decided to make a run at the playoffs
and vetoed the trades.
</P>
<P>
   Angelos was lauded when the Orioles made it to the postseason as
the wild-card team, and they won the AL East the next season. But
failing to make the deals doomed the Orioles to mediocrity as they
got older and more expensive.
</P>
<P>
   They finished below .500 the past two years and were a badly
beaten fourth in their division when they began dealing this
season.
</P>
<P>
   Without Mike Bordick, Charles Johnson, Will Clark, B.J. Surhoff,
Harold Baines and Mike Timlin, it's only going to get worse.
</P>
<P>
   The club is prepared to take the hit for a couple of years in
hopes that the course set over the past few days eventually will
lead the Orioles back to the promised land.
</P>
<P>
   ``Somebody is going to be able to sit up here three years from
now and say how smart they are,'' Thrift said.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps. It worked for the Chicago White Sox, who arrived at The
Ballpark in Arlington on Tuesday with the best record in the
American League three years after trading some of their best
players for prospects.
</P>
<P>
   And perhaps not.
</P>
<P>
   Only two of the 11 minor-leaguers they traded for are considered
top prospects, although Thrift said there could be a couple of
other gems.
</P>
<P>
   ``Most people can only see what they see now,'' Thrift said.
``It's hard to see what somebody has done at Double-A baseball,
Triple A or the (Class A) South Atlantic League. We have to rely on
people's judgment, the scouts, and all the people who've seen them
play.''
</P>
<P>
   The quality of the prospects is only part of the equation. The
team's remaining stars could be ready to jump ship.
</P>
<P>
   The deals freed up payroll that could be used to re-sign ace
pitcher Mike Mussina, a potential free agent at the end of the
season, but Mussina doesn't appear inclined to stay after the
purge.
</P>
<P>
   ``It seemed like we were having a little too much fun and went
too far,'' Mussina said. ``If they were trying to make a point, I
think they did that.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a big question mark on what I want to do now. I don't
think it takes a genius to figure out they've put the club in a
position where they aren't looking to be competitive for a couple
years. So where does that leave me?''
</P>
<P>
   In a different uniform, more likely than not, meaning the
Orioles will be even worse.
</P>
<P>
   But even with Mussina and the traded veterans, they weren't
going to be World Series contenders in the next couple of years.
</P>
<P>
   The trades might not produce a White Sox-like turnaround within
three years, but they had to be made. nn

FORT WORTH/DALLAS SENIOR EVENT HITS ANOTHER HAZARD
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JIMMY BURCH 
c.2000 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Someone hit the light switch.
</P>
<P>
   The Fort Worth-Dallas area's on-again, off-again relationship
with the Senior PGA Tour appears headed to the off position after
this season.
</P>
<P>
   It might not be a permanent withdrawal, but the Senior Tour
seems destined to bypass the area for at least one year after the
final putt drops at the Bank One Senior Championship, scheduled for
Sept. 22-24 at Bent Tree Country Club in Dallas.
</P>
<P>
   Bank One officials have announced plans to drop their
sponsorship of the event after this season, choosing not to
exercise an option for 2001.
</P>
<P>
   ``Corporately, a different set of priorities going into next
year leads us to where we are today,'' said Norm Bagwell, president
of Bank One-Dallas. ``Golf is important to us. Dallas-Fort Worth is
important to us. But this is something we have to do.''
</P>
<P>
   With no replacement sponsor rushing to step in and shoulder the
primary financial burden of the $1.4 event for next season, the
smart money is that a Fort Worth-Dallas stop will be omitted from
the 2001 tour. Tour officials anticipate finalizing next year's
schedule by Aug. 15, but the process already has been delayed
because of sponsorship shuffles, and additional delays are
possible.
</P>
<P>
   Jeff Adams, Senior Tour director of public relations, said
officials are unsure about the area's future as a regular tour
stop. The one certainty is that PGA commissioner Tim Finchem wants
to maintain a Senior Tour presence in the area, in some form or
fashion. Toward that end, tour officials include Fort Worth-Dallas
on a short list of markets under consideration to join the rotation
as a host site for the Senior Tour Championship.
</P>
<P>
   In some ways, that seems an appropriate choice: intermittent
tournaments for an area with an intermittent history with the
Senior Tour. A regular stop on the Senior Tour from 1985-95, the
Fort Worth-Dallas area dropped off the calendar for three years
before resurfacing with last year's Bank One event. Now, it appears
another hiatus is inevitable.
</P>
<P>
   Even if a new sponsor emerges with interest in an annual event,
don't look for a deal to be ironed out in time for the 2001 season.
And don't look for it to be held at Bent Tree.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're not in a position to make a long-term commitment,'' said
Charlie Duty, the club's general manager. ``We wanted to be
instrumental in bringing the Senior Tour back to Dallas, but to go
beyond 2001 would have been tough for us.''
</P>
<P>
   Duty said the club plans installation of an irrigation system
and major renovations of all bunkers and greens, ideally within the
next two years. The scope of the project, he said, takes Bent Tree
out of the loop as a tournament site.
</P>
<P>
   If members of the senior circuit are to continue circulating in
the area after this season, look for one of two venues to emerge:
Dallas Athletic Club or Stonebriar Country Club in Frisco.
Officials at Stonebriar have expressed interest in landing a Senior
Tour event on their resort course, which is under construction and
will be accompanied by an adjacent hotel.
</P>
<P>
   A quick read of the tea leaves suggests that a return to
Stonebriar, where Senior Tour members competed on the club's
primary course from 1989-93, might be the most viable option in the
long run. But that could leave the area without a regular stop
until 2002 or later.
</P>
<P>
   Hopes for landing a Senior Tour Championship remain viable, but
tour officials need to find someone to run the event. Members of
the Salesmanship Club, who organize the GTE Byron Nelson Classic,
recently declined the tour's request to oversee such an event in
2001 or 2002 because they preferred to focus on their annual PGA
Tour stop.
</P>
<P>
   That leaves Fort Worth-Dallas in the dark about its Senior Tour
status beyond September. Tom Watson, the defending Bank One champ,
said he's optimistic someone will hit the light switch. And soon.
</P>
<P>
   ``Obviously, this is a very important market to the Senior
Tour,'' Watson said. ``I hope Tim (Finchem) ... will lead us to
someone to pick up where Bank One has led us. Nothing is forever. I
think we'll find another sponsor to keep an event in the area. But
I don't know who.''
</P>
<P>
   Problem is, neither does anyone else. SPOTLIGHT ON: WALRUS AT
WORK
</P>
<P>
   For the frequent flyers on the PGA Tour, a week spent competing
at home is a welcome relief. That will be the case this week for
Craig Stadler, a Denver resident who is hoping that a little home
cooking at The International event in Castle Pines, Colo., will
allow him to regain momentum and continue his trek toward a
career-best season in earnings.
</P>
<P>
   Stadler, 47, was well on his way until a rib injury sidelined
him for most of May. Because the injury forced him to withdraw from
the GTE Byron Nelson Classic and MasterCard Colonial, local golf
fans did not get to witness the sleeker Stadler, who dropped 50
pounds during the off-season and shed some long-term bad habits
while rededicating himself to golf.
</P>
<P>
   But he'll be on display this week, and Stadler figures his
physical condition is the best it has been since April 30, when he
lost a playoff to Robert Allenby at the Shell Houston Open. Even
after a three-month dry spell, during which Stadler has earned only
$20,000 while rebounding from the rib injury, he stands 65th on the
tour money list, at $492,562.
</P>
<P>
   That's more than Stadler pocketed in 1999 ($454,091) or 1998
($350,091). It puts him on pace to challenge his 1991 season, when
he collected $827,628.
</P>
<P>
   Until the injury, Stadler had missed only one day of playing
golf or hitting balls this season, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I hadn't done that since I was a kid,'' said Stadler, who
credits his revamped work habits with helping him turn a mental
corner as well.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've gotten away, my whole career, without working at my
game,'' said Stadler, a 12-time winner and the 1982 Masters champ.
``I was going downhill fast ... and I just got sick of the way I
was playing. So I decided I'd have a total revamp this year. I've
got three years until I turn 50 (and join the Senior Tour). More
than anything, I wanted to prove to myself that I can still compete
with these guys.''
</P>
<P>
   The bottom line?
</P>
<P>
   ``I've gone from 10 beers a day to 10 miles of walking a day,''
said Stadler, whose dimensions are listed at 5-foot-10, 220 pounds
in the tour media guide. ``I'm still fat as hell. But I think I'm
on the right road to recovery now.''
CHIP SHOTS CHARITY WINDFALL
</P>
<P>
   Despite plans to drop its sponsorship after September's event,
Bank One officials presented checks totaling $150,000 to two local
charities Monday. The Rising Star Program, created in 1999 to help
fund college educations for disadvantaged youths, and the Rotary
Club of Dallas received $75,000 donations.
</P>
<P>
   Dallas Mayor Ron Kirk urged another corporation to step forward
as a title sponsor to keep the Senior Tour playing in his town.
</P>
<P>
   ``I love golf ... I hope we can figure out a way to keep this
going in years to come,'' Kirk said. FLEISHER JOINS FIELD
</P>
<P>
   Bruce Fleisher, leading money winner on the Senior Tour
($1,837,906) and the 1999 Player of the Year, has committed to play
the Bank One event. Tournament officials have commitments from 16
of the top 20 players on last year's money list, as well as the
three most-celebrated 50-year-olds on the 2000 tour: Tom Watson,
Tom Kite and Lanny Wadkins. LOPEZ LIKES CHANGES
</P>
<P>
   Nancy Lopez, an LPGA Hall of Famer, said she is starting to reap
the benefits of recent sessions with Dave Pelz, a noted short-game
expert. The two began working together in early July, marking the
first lessons that Lopez, 43, has taken from anyone other than her
father in her career.
</P>
<P>
   ``I feel a lot more confident on my chipping and putting than I
have in a long, long time,'' Lopez said. ``I wish I would've
approached Dave a little earlier. We've only been working together
for a couple of weeks, but I think some big changes are coming. I
think correcting my short-game problems is going to take two or
three strokes off my game. And two or three strokes every day is
going to help tremendously.'' SORENSTAM'S QUEST
</P>
<P>
   With a victory at this week's Michelob Light Classic, defending
champ Annika Sorenstam can join Laura Davies as the only LPGA
participants to win the same event in four consecutive seasons.
Sorenstam has earned four of her 23 career victories at Forest
Hills Country Club in St. Louis, Mo., including each of the past
three years.
</P>
<P>
   Davies won the Standard Register Ping event each year from
1994-97.
LPGA GOLDEN MOMENTS May 21, 1999
</P>
<P>
   Beth Daniel unleashed the most prolific birdie barrage in LPGA
Tour history at the Philips Invitational in Austin. Daniel, a Hall
of Famer, birdied nine consecutive holes at Onion Creek Country
Club (Nos. 7-15). Daniel shot a 62 during the second round, the
lowest score of her 22-year career.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps appropriately, Daniel's record-setting run came in the
same season (1999) in which she was inducted into the LPGA Hall of
Fame. Daniel, 43, has 32 victories and one major championship (1990
LPGA Championship).
TIPS FROM THE PROS
</P>
<P>
   ``During golf season, the'' Star-Telegram ``will feature
occasional tips from professional golf instructors based in Tarrant
County. Today's tip is from Amy Fox, director of instruction at
Golf Center of Fort Worth. Fox was selected as the 1999 Teaching
Professional of the Year by the LPGA and was named one of the
nation's top 50 golf instructors by'' Golf for Women ``magazine.
Fox works with several notable amateur and college players,
including former TCU All-American Angela Stanford, a member of the
2000 U.S. Curtis Cup team.'' MATCH YOUR PUTTER, PHILOSOPHY
</P>
<P>
   Too many people try to shave strokes on the green by using the
wrong putter to accompany their putting stroke. That will never
work.
</P>
<P>
   To maximize abilities on the green, a player must settle on a
putting philosophy then pick the type of putter that matches. There
are two types of putters: those who use a straight-back,
straight-through approach and those who use an arcing motion that
is based more on feel.
</P>
<P>
   Lots of amateurs prefer the straight-back, straight-through
approach because it is a repetitive motion. Those players need more
of an upright putter, where the hands are held high. A Zebra putter
and most Ping putters are good examples. So are most blade putters.
You set up with your eyes over the ball and your hands high. It's
more of an upright stance.
</P>
<P>
   Several players on the PGA Tour, including Tiger Woods and Ben
Crenshaw, use an arcing motion that is a miniature of the golf
swing. They'll set up with their eyes inside the ball, with their
hands low. It's more of a squatting stance. The lie of their putter
needs to be flatter than those using the straight-back,
straight-through approach. Usually, there is an angle from the
putter head to the shaft. A lot of the Bullseye putters are good
examples.
</P>
<P>
   In putting, there is no right or wrong method. But everyone
tends to favor one style or the other. And you need to have a
putter to match your philosophy, or you won't be holing as many
putts as possible. If you're trying to swing straight-back,
straight-through with a flat putter, it just won't work.
</P>
<P>
   If you find yourself struggling to hole putts, you might be
using the wrong type of putter.
</P>
<P>
   The secret to saving strokes on the greens is finding out what's
comfortable for you, then matching your equipment with your putting
philosophy. nn

A SAN FRANCISCO STANDOFF
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     By SCOTT OSTLER 
 &HT;     c.2000 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ Remember this one? Five months ago, an
11-year-old kid was home alone in the Crocker-Amazon neighborhood,
got a scary phone call, dialed 911.
</P>
<P>
   Two San Francisco police officers responded. When the family
sheepdog, Sidney, attacked the female cop, her male rookie partner
tried to shoot the dog but missed and hit the female cop
 &UR; and  &LR; the kid with the same bullet.
</P>
<P>
   Kid got three-hour operation and possible growth problems, Mom
got scolded by cops, Dad (rushing home) got tossed to ground and
handcuffed, cop got treated for bullet and bite.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe a little too edgy for a Keystone Kops reel, but it has
that same zany feel.
</P>
<P>
   End of story? Nah.
</P>
<P>
   The kid, Max Castro, had the growth plate in one knee severed by
the bullet and still uses a wheelchair part of the time. The family
says it intends to sue the city for assault, battery, negligence
and intentional infliction of emotional distress.
</P>
<P>
   The family asked the female cop to take a blood test, to rule
out Max being infected by the bullet he and the cop shared. The
officer allegedly nixed the request for the test, for reasons
unknown, but some weeks later said she would take the test if the
family would agree not to sue her for any distress caused by the
delay.
</P>
<P>
   Family signed an agreement, then changed lawyers and pulled back
the agreement. The cop took the blood test, but the city attorney
is refusing to hand over the results unless the family reinstates
the agreement.
</P>
<P>
   Why didn't the cop take the test right away to put the family at
ease? The city says she is not legally obligated to be
blood-tested, but what the heck? She was half of a police team that
was involved in the shooting of an innocent kid.
</P>
<P>
   Margaret Baumgartner, deputy city attorney, says the city is
trying to help the family, pay many of the medical bills, clear
everything up, but, ``Every step seems to be met with `Give me
more,' instead of `Thank you.' ''
</P>
<P>
   Says Baumgartner, ``All she (the cop) is saying is, `Don't sue
me.' ''
</P>
<P>
   But if the family has a legit lawsuit, why should it give up the
right to file? If the distress part of the suit is as bogus as the
city attorney's office insists it is, it will be tossed out in a
jiff.
</P>
<P>
   What we have is a San Francisco standoff. Meanwhile, Max
undergoes blood tests every month.
</P>
<P>
   The city attorney office's hints that perhaps the family is
being a bit opportunistic gets a rise out of Angela Alioto,
attorney for Max and the family.
</P>
<P>
   ``You don't normally call 911 and get shot by a police
officer,'' Alioto notes.
</P>
<P>
   Sidney is doing fine.
</P>
<P>
   HAPPY HOUR: Dave Heventhal and his wife were walking along
Stinson Beach in front of the gated Seadrift community when they
came upon a Norman Rockwell scene, a youngster with a lemonade
stand.
</P>
<P>
   The crayoned sign read ``25 cents,'' and in larger letters,
``Add $2 for Kettle One with lemonade.''
</P>
<P>
   Kettle One is a yuppie-favored imported vodka. Brings out the
flavor of the lemonade.
</P>
<P>
   EYES ON THE blink, Lotta Dotz went in for a repair.
</P>
<P>
   Thanks to Lotta's HMO, the operation to replace the lens of one
eye cost a total of $10.
</P>
<P>
   Recuperating at the Beverly Wilshire Hotel in Bev Hills, Lotta
ordered a hot dog. It was $9.
</P>
<P>
   That's today's financial news: A gourmet hot dog is still
cheaper than a new eye. Unless you tip for the dog.
</P>
<P>
   LUCKY BOY, the artist featured here Monday for his unique relief
maps of San Francisco, now has people clamoring for his work. The
clamorers must have patience.
</P>
<P>
   Lucky makes maps large and small, in chocolate and on Frisbees,
but he isn't really set up for a retail blitz. However, if you want
more info, e-mail him at
 &UR; Nowadayssanfrancisco &LR; yahoo.com,  &LR; and eventually he'll get back to
you.
</P>
<P>
   MR. EAT urges you to eat well. He recommends a good place called
Nirvana, on Castro between 18th and 19th.
</P>
<P>
   For under $10 you get Thai noodles with chicken and a drink _ an
alcoholic mixed drink. A double, yet.
</P>
<P>
   If you're in a hurry, say, ``Gimme a double order of the noodles
and chicken, hold the noodles and chicken.''
</P>
<P>
   NOW THAT legendary bartender Mike McCourt has moved his ice and
olives to the Buchanan Grill in the Marina, the regulars there are
looking forward to playing McCourt's overs-unders obits game.
</P>
<P>
   It's easy. You place your bet (in pretend money, of course) on
whether you think there will be more than 22 or fewer than 22 death
notices on The Chronicle's obituary page the next day.
</P>
<P>
   If you lose, but one of the obits is yours, your bet is
refunded.

   PHILADELPHIA _ _ Former President Gerald Ford was taken to a
hospital around midnight Tuesday with a sinus infection, after
leaving the Republican National Convention, where he had been
honored in an emotional tribute.
</P>
<P>
   Ford, 87, was driven by his staff to the Hahnemann University
Hospital, where he was treated with an antibotic. His spokesman,
Calvin G. McDowell, said a wax build-up led to an infection. ``He's
fine,'' McDowell said.
</P>
<P>
   Ford, walking on his own, left the hospital at 1:36 a.m. on
Wednesday along with his wife, Betty. ``I feel good, that's why I'm
here,'' Ford said as he climbed into his car.
</P>
<P>
   Ford appeared frail as he sat in a VIP box at the back of the
First Union Center on Tuesday night along with his wife, former
President George Bush and his wife, Barbara, and other prominent
Republicans. He was visibly moved when a video-taped tribute to him
was displayed on the large screens inside the hall.
</P>
<P>
   ``When uncertainty troubled our nation, President Gerald Ford
renewed America's confidence,'' Gov. George Pataki of New York
said, introducing the tribute. ``His strength, his strength and
integrity defended our values at home in an ever-changing world.''
</P>
<P>
   The crowd cheered when Pataki invoked ``President Ford's steady
leadership and Mrs. Ford's gentle grace.''
</P>
<P>
   He rose and waved to acknowledge the cheers of the audience.
</P>
<P>
   Although Ford did not address the convention, he told C-Span
that this would be the last convention he and his wife would
attend, calling it a ``concluding appearance to indicate our
support.''
</P>
<P>
   Asked about his health in an interview broadcast Tuesday night
on ``Larry King Live,'' the former president said, ``I couldn't be
healthier.''
</P>
<P>
   McDowell, a spokesman for Ford, said Ford had been complaining
about feeling ``uncomfortable'' and asked to be taken to the
hospital. While he was at the hospital, he was visited by Andrew
Card, the convention chairman.

 MCCAIN SALUTES FORMER FOE  &HT;     By CARLA MARINUCCI and MARC SANDALOW 
 &HT;     c.2000 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHILADELPHIA _ In an eloquent tribute aimed at burying a bitter
rivalry, Arizona Sen. John McCain delivered a full-throated
endorsement Tuesday night of George W. Bush as a man who would not
``squander this moment in history.''
</P>
<P>
   McCain, who represented the only major obstacle to Bush's drive
for the GOP nomination, dismissed himself as merely ``a distant
runner-up'' before a crowd firmly committed to the Texas governor
at the Republican National Convention.
</P>
<P>
   ``I support him. I am grateful to him. And I am proud of him,''
said McCain, insisting that Bush is the best choice to restore the
nation's military strength. ``I am proud to do so, for I know that
by supporting George W. Bush, I serve my country well.''
</P>
<P>
   He then touted the credentials of the man he once belittled for
his lack of foreign policy experience and labeled as unelectable
against Al Gore.
</P>
<P>
   Taking the stage to the theme from ``Star Wars,'' McCain _ who
once compared himself in his fight against Bush to Luke Skywalker _
portrayed Bush as a man who could keep the nation strong while
inspiring America to new heights.
</P>
<P>
   ``America's greatness is a quest without end,'' said McCain. ``I
have faith. I have faith in you ... and I am haunted by the vision
of what will be.''
</P>
<P>
   The dramatic speech closed out the second night of the
Republican National Convention dedicated to honoring war heroes and
America's military might. Without ever mentioning President Clinton
or Vice President Al Gore by name, speaker after speaker said the
nation's reputation on the world stage depends on Bush's election.
</P>
<P>
   The otherwise tightly controlled display of GOP unity was marred
only when Arizona Rep. Jim Kolbe took the stage to deliver a speech
on free trade. Many Texas delegates bowed their heads in prayer
when Kolbe, who is openly gay, began talking. Kolbe's speech had
been hailed by gay Log Cabin Republicans as a sign that Bush
advocates a more inclusive party.
</P>
<P>
   ``Most of America does not agree with the message (of) that
lifestyle,'' said Texas delegate Cathie Adams. ``Our children and
grandchildren are watching.''
</P>
<P>
   But the moment did little to upstage the evening's festivities,
which included speeches from a four-star general, two war heroes
and a Cold War expert.
</P>
<P>
   General H. Norman Schwarzkopf, commander of Operation Desert
Storm, former Sen. Bob Dole, Elizabeth Dole and Condoleezza Rice, a
former Stanford University provost and current Bush foreign policy
adviser, all preceded McCain.
</P>
<P>
   Delegates also watched video tributes to three living GOP
presidents, Gerald Ford, George Bush and Ronald Reagan. Two of them
looked on in the hall _ Ford and his wife, Betty, and Bush and his
wife, Barbara.
</P>
<P>
   Nancy Reagan, who flew from California to represent her
critically ill husband, received a warm acknowledgment from the
delegates. In a reminder of the depth of affection for the former
president, now 89 and ill with Alzheimer's disease, she also
received what may have been the night's biggest applause line when
a video tribute replayed his famous entreaty in Berlin: ``Mr.
Gorbachev, take down this wall.''
</P>
<P>
   Before Tuesday evening's session began, demonstrators clashed
violently with police, tying up the heart of downtown Philadelphia.
At least 280 people were arrested as confrontations continued into
the night.
</P>
<P>
   The protests were far from the arena where the convention is
being held, and other than creating traffic tie-ups that delayed
some delegates from arriving on the convention floor, they appeared
to have little impact on the proceedings.
</P>
<P>
   Inside the hall, McCain, who has been grabbing headlines and
front page photos all week, had to walk a delicate political
tightrope: He needed to make a strong case for Bush _ but not so
strong as to upstage him.
</P>
<P>
   McCain barely touched on the themes of campaign finance and
political independence that galvanized his followers and made him a
thorn in the side to Bush. Instead, the former Vietnam POW appealed
to American patriotism, saying that  &LR; the nation has ``a grander
purpose`' than mere politics.
</P>
<P>
   &LR; COL. 2 of MAIN02 (105483 ) &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &LR;  ``We are part of something providential, a great experiment to
prove to the world that democracy is not only the most effective
form of government, but the only moral government,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We need to get riled up a bit, and stand up for the values
that made America great,'' McCain said to a standing ovation.
``Americans, enter the public life of your country determined to
tell the truth.''
</P>
<P>
   George Bush, the nation's 41st president, also offered a video
endorsement of his son's credentials in foreign policy.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think George's record can stand all the scrutiny in the
world,'' the former president said. ``I think it will show a man of
honor, a man of integrity.''
</P>
<P>
   Dole, a World War II veteran and the party's failed 1996
presidential candidate, joined those extolling Bush's virtues, as
did his wife, Elizabeth, who was once  &LR; had challenged Bush for the
GOP nomination.
</P>
<P>
   And Gov. Bush himself, campaigning in Gettysburg, Pa., greeted
delegates by video and introduced Rice, his foreign policy adviser,
as ``my dear friend,'' an accomplished concert pianist and figure
skater.
</P>
<P>
   She called Bush ``a nominee who knows the power of truth and
honor. We have a nominee who will be the next great president of
the United States of America.''
</P>
<P>
   Rice said both Bush and his vice presidential nominee Dick
Cheney understand that foreign policy ``all begins with integrity
in the Oval Office. ... Friend and foe will know he keeps his word,
and tells the truth.''
</P>
<P>
   And she said Bush would lead a nation that would ``exercise
power without fanfare and arrogance.''

   &UR; GOP CONVENTION _ (Moved in ``p'' category) &LR;
</P>
<P>
   GOP-FUNDRAISING (Philadelphia) _ Republican officials insist
that their financial base is primarily small donors, but the party
has received more than $90 million from a relatively small pool of
wealthy individuals and corporations, some of whom have shielded
their generosity from public view. By Don Van Natta Jr. and John M.
Broder.
</P>
<P>
   GOP-ASSESS (Philadelphia) _ Tuesday night, for the second night
in a row, one of the principal speakers at the Republican National
Convention was a black person. Tuesday night, it was Condoleezza
Rice, the chief national security adviser to Gov. George W. Bush of
Texas; on Monday night, it was Colin Powell, who may be secretary
of state if Bush is elected president. Obviously, this was no
happenstance. In this convention, whose sole mission is the
glorification of Bush, happenstance just doesn't happen. By R.W.
Apple Jr.
</P>
<P>
   GOP-BUSH-ASSESS-NYT _ George W. Bush often talks about this
election as a fight over who is better prepared to lead the nation
into the future, but in many ways, it is turning into a fight about
the past, particularly the 1992 election of Bill Clinton and the
defeat of George H.W. Bush. By Frank Bruni.

<P>
   GOP-NEGATIVE-CAMPAIGN-NYT _ For all their focus on a kinder,

chief of staff, congressman and secretary of defense, has lived in
the bubble of public life for more than a quarter a century, but he
hasn't run for re-election as Wyoming's lone House member since
1988, and in signing up to be Gov. George W. Bush's running mate,

   CHINA-AIDS (Beijing) _ With the AIDS virus moving silently
through China, a number of China's leading medical experts have
begun to angrily complain that the government has done too little
define the epidemic and to prevent the virus' spread. Official
inattention and the lack of a national public education program
have already allowed HIV to transform from an fairly rare condition
among intravenous drug users in 1990, to a rapidly growing problem
that now effects an estimated 600,000 Chinese, the scientists say.
And in another 10 years, they warn, China will have one of the

   SOMALIA-REVIVE (Arta, Djibouti) _ About 2,000 ordinary Somalis,
along with most of their leaders, have been meeting in this
neighboring country since March, trying _ for the 13th time _ to
re-make Somalia, which collapsed in civil war in 1991. So far, they
have agreed on a national charter. Within the next week they expect
to have elected a three-year, 225-member national assembly. They
have picked a temporary capital, in the southern city of Baidoa.
And already, the campaign for the next president, to be elected
here by the assembly members, is in high gear. By Ian Fisher.

PUC CALLS FOR PROBE OF DEREGULATION
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     By DAVID LAZARUS 
 &HT;     c.2000 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Amid soaring electricity bills and a threat of blackouts, state
officials conclude that energy deregulation in California is not
working and see ``enough evidence of questionable behavior'' to
warrant an investigation by the attorney general.
</P>
<P>
   The findings are laid out in a high-level report by the
California Public Utilities Commission to Gov. Gray Davis, to be
released Wednesday. A draft of the report's executive summary was
obtained by The Chronicle.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Bay Area blackouts, the run-up in prices in the wholesale
electricity markets and the rise in retail electricity prices in
San Diego show that the new system is not working for California,''
the draft report says.
</P>
<P>
   It says that ``enough evidence of questionable behavior exists''
to warrant an investigation by Attorney General Bill Lockyer.
</P>
<P>
   Davis is expected to issue an executive order Wednesday
outlining steps Californians can take to reduce energy consumption.
</P>
<P>
   The governor also will call for an investigation of the state's
power market by state and federal officials, sources said.
</P>
<P>
   Lockyer already is looking into the recent price increases in
San Diego. His spokeswoman, Sandra Michioku, said the attorney
general will decide whether his investigation should be expanded in
light of the PUC's report.
</P>
<P>
   Public protests are spreading as power bills in San Diego _ the
first California city to face the full effects of energy
deregulation _ continue to climb amid a continuing heat wave in
much of the West.
</P>
<P>
   Average monthly residential power bills in the Southern
California city have doubled over the past three months to more
than $100.
</P>
<P>
   Pacific Gas and Electric Co. has said the same thing could
happen to its customers when deregulation takes effect in Northern
California, perhaps as soon as next summer.
</P>
<P>
   The PUC, scheduled to take up the matter of San Diego's sky-high
power bills tomorrow, does not concede in its report that
deregulation has failed.
</P>
<P>
   But the commission, which played a major role in deregulating
the state's energy market in 1996, suggests that some regulation
may have to be reimposed to smooth out the state's energy supply.
</P>
<P>
   It notes that an ability ``to set and enforce standards is an
essential element in restoring stability and predictability for
California consumers.''
</P>
<P>
   The report also stresses that ``electricity is too fundamental a
necessity for California's economy and indeed for every Californian
to leave accountability for its delivery and pricing so
fragmented.''
</P>
<P>
   Consumer advocates charge that power generators are gouging
consumers by pushing wholesale electricity rates through the roof
during peak summertime demand.
</P>
<P>
   Power companies have countered that their rates only reflect
supply and demand and that California is paying the price for
neglecting to build sufficient generating facilities over the past
decade.
</P>
<P>
   The California Independent System Operator, a nonprofit agency
that oversees the state's energy grid, declared a ``stage 2
emergency'' Wednesday, which means that power reserves fell below 5
percent.
</P>
<P>
   PG&AMP;E in turn said it cut power to 215 industrial customers that
have agreed, in return for lower rates throughout the year, to
accept voluntary disruptions during periods of extraordinary
demand.
</P>
<P>
   Patrick Dorinson, a spokesman for the ISO, said his agency came
``very close'' to declaring a stage 3 emergency Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   A stage 3 emergency, which has never been called on a statewide
basis, means that power reserves almost have been depleted and that
utilities are empowered to initiate so-called rolling blackouts
among all customers.
</P>
<P>
   Dorinson said he expects Wednesday to be ``another tough day''
for California's power grid, with the possibility for a stage 3
emergency persisting.
</P>
<P>
   In its report, the PUC blamed the state's chronic power woes on
unusually hot weather, aging power plants, weak transmission
infrastructure and ``dysfunctional bidding behavior'' in wholesale
electricity markets.
</P>
<P>
   The report called the price increases in San Diego and June's
blackouts in the Bay Area ``a precursor of what lies ahead for
California's economy over the next 30 months.''
</P>
<P>
   But consumer advocates were unimpressed by the commission's
overall view of the power situation. They saw very little that was
new in the PUC's description of deregulation's shortcomings.
</P>
<P>
   ``This report doesn't inspire any optimism,'' said Michael
Shames, executive director of San Diego's Utility Consumers' Action
Network.
</P>
<P>
   He said it looks like the PUC is merely providing Davis with the
political cover necessary to seek gradual remedies for the state's
electricity shortfall.
</P>
<P>
   ``That won't do anything to help San Diegans, who are now eating
it big time,'' Shames said.
</P>
<P>
   Nettie Hoge, executive director of the Utility Reform Network in
San Francisco, commented that by calling for the attorney general
to investigate the power market, the PUC has skirted making its own
allegations against power companies.
</P>
<P>
   She also observed that the PUC has been a leading booster of
energy deregulation and is thus an unlikely champion for reform.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're dyed-in-the-wool free-marketers,'' Hoge said. ``They
aren't going to go back on core values.''
</P>
<P>
   The only proposal on the table for the PUC's meeting tomorrow in
essence encourages the commission to allow deregulation to run its
course.
</P>
<P>
   However, consumer groups say they will push the commissioners to
consider rolling back electricity rates in San Diego to
pre-deregulation levels and freezing rates at that level.

 GOP FUNDING SOURCES TAPPED BY DAVIS  &HT;     By LYNDA GLEDHILL and GREG LUCAS 
 &HT;     c.2000 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SACRAMENTO _ Gov. Gray Davis raked in $8.1 million in the first
six months of the year by tapping traditional GOP sources of money,
including at least $370,000 from the insurance industry.
</P>
<P>
   Oil companies, health care providers and Indian tribes that
operate casinos also represented a hefty chunk of the governor's
windfall, which now totals $21.4 million received since he took
office.
</P>
<P>
   The figures are contained in financial disclosure documents that
had to be filed by Monday with state election officials in
Sacramento.
</P>
<P>
   ``It seems (Davis) cares about the interests of business, so
business cares about the interests of the governor,'' said Barry
Carmody, president of the the Association of California Insurance
Companies.
</P>
<P>
   ``The governor is the most conservative Democrat in the process.
If a governor says, `I'm going to try to do what's right for
California economically,' he'll get business support,'' Carmody
said. ``And so far, that's been his moves.''
</P>
<P>
   Although Davis is a tenacious fund-raiser, traditional GOP
contributors _ oil companies, health insurers, utilities _ also
know actions by the Davis administration can sharply impact their
bottom line.
</P>
<P>
   And contributing to his campaign coffers appears to get Davis'
attention.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, for example, three days after attending a fund-raiser
hosted by the health care industry, Davis asked lawmakers to slow
down the progress of bills increasing state regulation of the
industry.
</P>
<P>
   Davis denied any connection between the two events.
</P>
<P>
   It's the appearance of pay-to-play that bothers political
observers.
</P>
<P>
   ``The only difference between campaign contributions and
outright bribery is pretension,'' said Robert Fellmeth, a law
professor at the University of San Diego. ``Campaign contributions
get access, and access gets results. Anybody who denies that is
lying.''
</P>
<P>
   But Davis' chief political adviser, Garry South, has said Davis
needs to raise significant amounts of money to be prepared for a
wealthy opponent in 2002.
</P>
<P>
   Davis took in large sums from several high-profile industries,
including insurance companies and Indian tribes.
</P>
<P>
   Some of the top Indian tribe contributors include the Rumsey
Rancheria, which gave $50,000, the Morongo Band, which donated
$35,000, and the Cabazon Band of Mission Indians, which gave
$50,000.
</P>
<P>
   Davis also listed as a nonmonetary contribution, $3,490 for the
use of the Cabazon Band's airplane.
</P>
<P>
   At $125,000, Fireman's Fund insurance in Novato was third on
Davis' list of top 10 contributors for the first six months of
2000.
</P>
<P>
   But other insurers kicked in. Zenith Insurance gave $75,000.
Progressive Insurance gave $30,000. Farmers Insurance Group of
Companies cq  &LR; came in at $40,000. Contributing $35,000 was 21st
Century Insurance Group.
</P>
<P>
   Davis also tapped Silicon Valley companies and executives.
</P>
<P>
   Intel Corp. gave $10,000, while Intuit donated $25,000. Steve
Westly, a manager at eBay, gave $10,000.
</P>
<P>
   Hewlett Packard gave $25,000. John T. Chambers, CEO of Cisco,
gave Davis $50,000.
</P>
<P>
   Also on Davis' top 10 list was Chevron at $120,000. It was one
of the largest contributors to Dan Lungren, Davis' GOP opponent in
1998.
</P>
<P>
   Health insurers _ who are now subject to regulation by a new
Department of Managed Care created by Davis _ were generous givers.
</P>
<P>
   Blue Cross gave $30,000. Blue Shield contributed $21,000. The
California Healthcare Association kicked in $25,000.
</P>
<P>
   The California Medical Association, which represents doctors and
often battles health insurers, contributed $50,000 to Davis.
</P>
<P>
   Another of Davis' larger contributors is the California Trucking
Association, at $75,000. One of the association's chief concerns
are air-quality decisions by the state Air Resources Board, whose
members Davis appoints.
</P>
<P>
   Among individual contributors are several of Davis appointees,
including former Rep. Doug Bosco, whom Davis placed on the state
Industrial Welfare Commission. Bosco gave $10,000.
</P>
<P>
   So did Sherry Lansing, president of Paramount Studios. Davis
named her a University of California regent.
</P>
<P>
   The chairman of Westwood One, Norman Pattiz, who is hosting an
exclusive party for Gray &LR; Davis and selected members of the media
before the Democratic convention in Los Angeles, donated $25,000.
</P>
<P>
   Davis' two biggest individual donors last year did not close
their wallets this year.
</P>
<P>
   Jerry Perenchio, the billionaire owner of Univision, the
nation's largest Spanish-language television network, gave Davis
$250,000. He contributed the same amount last year.
</P>
<P>
   David Shimmon increased his contribution to $225,000 _ up from
$200,000 last year.
</P>
<P>
   Shimmon is a multimillionaire from Los Altos and president of a
subsidiary of U.S. Filters, a Palm Desert firm that is a major
player in California water issues and a large landowner in Imperial
County.
</P>
<P>
   Familiar names also popped up on Davis' list of contributors,
including all three owners of DreamWorks, SKG.: Steven Spielberg,
David Geffen and Jeffrey Katzenberg. Each gave $8,333.
</P>
<P>
   Davis received money from other major Hollywood studios: $50,000
from the Walt Disney Co.; $25,000 from Warner Bros. PAC; $10,000
from Universal Studios; and $5,000 from Paramount Pictures.
</P>
<P>
   Richard Riordan, the mayor of Los Angeles, gave $12,500, while
the Robert Mondavi Winery gave $25,000.
</P>
<P>
   Gail Zappa, the widow of Frank Zappa, donated $5,000.

ANALYSIS: REPUBLICANS TAKE THE HIGH ROAD IN NOT MENTIONING 
 CLINTON, GORE
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     By MARC SANDALOW 
 &HT;     c.2000 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
 &LR;   &LR;  PHILADELPHIA _ From the fiery speeches at the podium to the
interviews on the arena floor, two favorite Republican topics are
conspicuously missing from the GOP convention: Bill Clinton and Al
Gore.
<P>
   Never mind that the White House's current occupant has been the
bane of the GOP's existence for nearly eight years, and that his
chosen successor is all that stands in the way of electing a
Republican president.
</P>
<P>
   After two days and nearly 10 hours of speeches, the words
``Clinton'' and ``Gore'' have hardly been uttered at the dais.
Republicans are determined to keep their message upbeat, and if
that means forgoing the traditional skewering of their rivals, so
be it.
</P>
<P>
   Mindful of the nation's disgust with what Elizabeth Dole last
night described as ``smash-mouth politics,'' Republicans hope that
if they remain positive and simply ignore the Democrats, Americans
will appreciate the difference between them.
</P>
<P>
   ``What we're not going to do is engage in the bitter, partisan
attacks that have larded our political process the last eight
years,'' insisted Ed Gillespie, the GOP convention's program
director.
</P>
<P>
   Like his selection of Dick Cheney as a running mate, which is
expected to provide little apparent electoral advantage, Texas Gov.
George W. Bush is determined to demonstrate that not every decision
is based on a political calculation.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are led right now by a different kind of Republican,'' said
Don Evans, Bush's campaign chairman, repeating a message he hopes
every convention viewer will pick up on &LR; .
</P>
<P>
   Bush himself appeared to have trouble abiding by the discipline
displayed by his surrogates. After Clinton belittled his philosophy
of compassionate conservatism Monday night as nothing more than a
``pretty package,'' Bush shot back Tuesday with some of his
toughest language to date, describing Clinton as ``so desperate to
have his legacy intact by getting Al Gore elected that he'll say
anything, just like Al Gore will.''
</P>
<P>
   But inside the convention hall, even veterans of slash-and-burn
politics held their tongues. The once-cantankerous Bob Dole spared
Clinton and Gore the wrath of his wit, joking that 97-year-old Sen.
Strom Thurmond of South Carolina took him to Philadelphia's
Constitution Hall ``and showed me where he first met Ben
Franklin.''
</P>
<P>
   The practice of insulting the other party is a convention
tradition at least as rich as bunting and balloons. In 1988,
then-Gov. Ann Richards of Texas lampooned Bush's father for having
been born with ``a silver foot in his mouth.''
</P>
<P>
   Four years ago at the GOP convention in San Diego, New York Rep.
Susan Molinari railed against Clinton's credibility in a keynote
address. ``Americans know that Bill Clinton's promises have the
life span of a Big Mac on Air Force One,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is always a saturation point,'' Republican Sen. Orrin
Hatch of Utah said afterward. ``But I don't think we've reached
it.''
</P>
<P>
   In Philadelphia, there has been no appetite for prolonged
criticism, let alone off-color jokes, about regarding  &LR; the
Democratic agenda, Clinton's libido or Gore's service to the
nation.
</P>
<P>
   ``People are fed up with it,'' Gillespie said. ``They want to
know what you're for.''
</P>
<P>
   But the strategy also risks alienating the party faithful. There
is a reason for attacks. They galvanize the base and help
crystallize the differences between candidates and parties.
</P>
<P>
   And their absence provides an opening to the opposition.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is no better politician on Earth than President Clinton.
Attacking him allows him to respond, and they're afraid of that,''
said Bob Mulholland, a consultant to the California Democratic
Party.
</P>
<P>
   Republicans seem to accept the softer tone as a wise political
decision.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think (the convention) is playing out just like they want it
to,'' Christian Coalition founder Pat Robertson said resignedly.
</P>
<P>
   Does he worry that the party is straying from its conservative
roots?
</P>
<P>
   ``Evangelical and social Christians trust George W. Bush,''
Robertson said. ``They are sophisticated enough to understand that
he's trying to win an election, and they're willing to give him a
little wiggle room here.''
</P>
<P>
   Senate Majority Leader Trent Lott of Mississippi, who has
engaged in his share of Clinton-Gore bashing in the past, showed
restraint when asked what sort of lawmaker Gore was when they
served together in Congress.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's no Dick Cheney,'' Lott said, before catching himself. The
convention, he quickly added, ``is about our people. It's not about
them.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush aides said the tone is the direct result of the governor's
requests and that it will be carried through tomorrow night, when
Bush delivers his acceptance speech.
</P>
<P>
   ``The governor's tone will be very positive and upbeat,'' said
Ari Fleischer, a Bush spokesman. ``He will be respectful and
polite.''
</P>
<P>
   Besides the candidate, the other Republican who appears closest
to crossing that line is President Bush, his father, who was asked

   PHILADELPHIA _ _ Former President Gerald Ford was taken to a
hospital around midnight Tuesday with a sinus infection, after
leaving the Republican National Convention, where he had been
honored in an emotional tribute.
</P>
<P>
   Ford, 87, was driven by his staff to the Hahnemann University
Hospital, where he was treated with an antibotic. His spokesman,
Calvin G. McDowell, said a wax build-up led to an infection. ``He's
fine,'' McDowell said.
</P>
<P>
   Ford, walking on his own, left the hospital at 1:36 a.m. on
Wednesday along with his wife, Betty. ``I feel good, that's why I'm
here,'' Ford said as he climbed into his car.
</P>
<P>
   Ford appeared frail as he sat in a VIP box at the back of the
First Union Center on Tuesday night along with his wife, former
President George Bush and his wife, Barbara, and other prominent
Republicans. He was visibly moved when a video-taped tribute to him
was displayed on the large screens inside the hall.
</P>
<P>
   ``When uncertainty troubled our nation, President Gerald Ford
renewed America's confidence,'' Gov. George Pataki of New York
said, introducing the tribute. ``His strength, his strength and
integrity defended our values at home in an ever-changing world.''
</P>
<P>
   The crowd cheered when Pataki invoked ``President Ford's steady
leadership and Mrs. Ford's gentle grace.''
</P>
<P>
   He rose and waved to acknowledge the cheers of the audience.
</P>
<P>
   Although Ford did not address the convention, he told C-Span
that this would be the last convention he and his wife would
attend, calling it a ``concluding appearance to indicate our
support.''
</P>
<P>
   Asked about his health in an interview broadcast Tuesday night
on ``Larry King Live,'' the former president said, ``I couldn't be
healthier.''
</P>
<P>
   McDowell, a spokesman for Ford, said Ford had been complaining
about feeling ``uncomfortable'' and asked to be taken to the
hospital. While he was at the hospital, he was visited by Andrew
Card, the convention chairman.

ROOKIE GETS BEST OF ANGELS

<P>
   ANAHEIM, Calif. _ There were no dramatic late-inning comebacks
this time, no heart-stopping rallies. The Angels simply fell to the
Detroit Tigers 6-3 without much of a fight Tuesday night in front
of 19,104 at Edison Field.
</P>
<P>
   The offense was shut down most of the game by Tigers starter
Adam Bernero, a 23-year-old right-hander who began the season in
Double-A. The bullpen was unable to come to the rescue of the
starting pitcher, like it has so often this season. And the
starting pitcher _ Brian Cooper _ watched helplessly as six good
innings went down the drain in a hard-luck seventh inning.
</P>
<P>
   That's when the Tigers scored four runs to break a 2-2 tie _
three of the runs charged to Cooper _ an inning manufactured by
bloops and bleeders.
</P>
<P>
   Cooper (4-6), who hasn't won since July 17, gave up five runs
and eight hits in 6 innings.
</P>
<P>
   Bernero didn't look like someone making his major-league debut
against an Angels offense that ranks second in the league in hits.
However, he did get help along the way, particularly from first
base umpire Jerry Meals.
</P>
<P>
   In the third, the Angels had runners on second and third with
one out when Scott Spiezio hit a line drive to right field.
</P>
<P>
   Though replays showed Juan Gonzalez short-hopped the ball, Meals
called Spiezio out. Meanwhile, Adam Kennedy didn't tag at third
before coming home. The Tigers appealed at third and Kennedy was
called out, completing the double play and ending the inning.
</P>
<P>
   ``From a straight-on angle, I could see it short-hop into his
glove,'' Kennedy said. ``(Meals) must not have had a good angle.''
</P>
<P>
   Kennedy said he never saw Meals give the out sign, figuring the
umpire saw the play correctly.
</P>
<P>
   ``After I crossed the plate the catcher tagged me,'' he said.
``So I figured something was going on.''
</P>
<P>
   Angels manager Mike Scioscia said Kennedy made the right play.
</P>
<P>
   ``We saw the ball bounce and Adam did too,'' Scioscia said.
``He's busting home to beat the play.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's safe to say it's a momentum-changer, but it wasn't the
defining moment. We had opportunities after that.''
</P>
<P>
   Kennedy also wouldn't blame the loss on the bad call.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not the reason we lost the game,'' he said. ``When did
that happen, the third inning? And we can't score more than that
for six more innings? We never really got anything going after
that. We're a better offense than to let something that happened in
the third inning determine the game.''
</P>
<P>
   Cooper gave up solo homers to Juan Encarnacion in the third
inning and Gonzalez in the sixth, and the Tigers took a 2-0 lead
into the bottom of the sixth. That's when the Angels finally got
through against Bernero.
</P>
<P>
   Tim Salmon, who struck out looking in his first two at-bats,
grounded a single up the middle to score two runs and tie the
score. It also knocked Bernero (5 innings, 2 runs, 5 hits) out of
the game. Salmon, who also doubled, now has hit in 10 consecutive
games.
</P>
<P>
   The Tigers regained the lead in the seventh and knocked Cooper
out of the game.
</P>
<P>
   Ex-Angel Damion Easley drove in one run with a bloop single, and
after Mike Holtz replaced Cooper, Bobby Higginson drove in a run
with a broken-bat single for a 4-2 Tigers lead.
</P>
<P>
   Mike Fyhrie replaced Holtz and got what seemed to be a big out
when he struck out Gonzalez for the second out of the inning. But
Dean Palmer followed and hit the first pitch he saw into the
right-center field gap for a two-run double and a 6-2 Tigers lead.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think my only problem is late in the game, a close game, I
try to do too much,'' Cooper said. ``I'm trying to throw the ball
too hard, or trying to make the ball break too much.''
</P>
<P>
   Spiezio homered to lead off the Angels' eighth inning, cutting
the Tigers' lead to 6-3.
</P>
<P>
   But Todd Jones, who suffered only his second blown save of the
season Monday night, got the final three outs for his American
League-leading 30th save. &QL;

   The 75th anniversary celebration continues with a nostalgic
retelling of the time the Soviet Union banned the magazine for
being ``ideologically subversive'' material that ``propagandized
the American way of life.'' It happened in February 1965 - a dark,

sure to confuse or frighten everyone over the age of 22 who clings
to the delusion that they remain even remotely hip. The premiere
issue includes two CDs, both of which go heavy on synthetic drum

insert wild animals into shots of handsome chaps wearing garments
made of wild-animal skin. Funny, if you're not an alligator. But
the reason to buy is to read about Joe Queenan's ill-fated goodwill
mission to improve Franco-American relations. The writer applies
himself gamely at first but then takes to asking French citizens if
they feel like traitors for eating at McDonald's and asking
passersby where Jerry Lewis is buried. Funny, if you're not a surly
French person.

</P>
<P>
   ``AMERICAN RHAPSODY''
</P>
<P>
   ByJoe Eszterhas
</P>
<P>
   (Knopf, $25.95)
</P>
<P>
   We'll say right upfront that we felt as if we earned our salary
for the next five years as we struggled through this book, a
quagmire of gonzo posturing and other strange liberties to which
Eszterhas believes he's entitled. The former (beginitalic)Rolling
Stone(enditalic) writer, having made his money with screenplays to
such scintillating films as (beginitalic)Showgirls(enditalic) and
(beginitalic)Basic Instinct(enditalic)(beginitalic), (enditalic)
now shows us the real Bill Clinton or, as Eszterhas' friend, Jann
Wenner, called him, ``the first rock and roll president in American
history.'' Eszterhas was mesmerized by the Monica Lewinsky sex
scandal. He devoured the Starr report, watched it on television,
read about it in magazines. Maybe they are his sources for the
garish ``non-fiction'' sections here, but he never really makes
that clear (there are fictional parts too, including a chapter
narrated by ``Willard,'' the most famous part of Clinton's
anatomy). Read this at your own risk. And remember: No one's paying
you to do it.

   ``LOCO FOR LIZARDS''
</P>
<P>
   By Jim Cherry
</P>
<P>
   (Northland, $7.95)
</P>
<P>
   Lizards, Cherry notes, predate dinosaurs, continents, even -
gasp! - (beginitalic)S(enditalic)(beginitalic)trom
Thurmond(enditalic). If that doesn't leave you hungry for more, you
are a hard sell. This brief, well-illustrated book tells you
everything you always wanted to know about lizards and a lot you
could have done without but aren't troubled to hear, such as the
fact that a monitor lizard can run 10 mph to catch the wild pigs it
likes for supper or that its mouth is so full of bacteria that its
bite will kill its victim within a day or two even if it gets away.
Cherry also includes general information on lizards in myth, art
and advertising and in film (we were delighted to see not just
(beginitalic)Godzilla(enditalic) and (beginitalic)Journey to the
Center of the Earth(enditalic) but also (beginitalic)The
Freshman(enditalic), Andrew Bergman's comedy in which a Komodo
dragon gets loose in a shopping mall). This is a good book to hand
over to visitors from the East as they watch geckos skitter across
your block wall.
</P>
<P>
   ``POOR RICHARD'S ALMANACK''
</P>
<P>
   By Benjamin Franklin
</P>
<P>
   (Modern Library, $10.95)
</P>
<P>
   Early to bed and early to rise makes a man miss pretty much
everything good on TV. That's Ben Franklin updated by Dave Barry in
his introduction to this new edition. Barry is hilarious, in fact,
as he questions the wisdom of a few of Franklin's statements -
particularly ``if your head is wax, don't walk in the sun'' - and
heartily endorses others. ``Poor Richard advocates diligence,
self-reliance, frugality and honesty,'' writes Barry. ``He disdains
laziness, extravagance, pretense and immodesty. It goes without
saying that he hates lawyers.'' This is one of the first four books
in the Modern Library Humor and Wit series. Others are
(beginitalic)Mark Twain's Library of Humor(enditalic), with an
introduction by Roy Blount, Jr.; (beginitalic)Most of the Most of
S.J. Perelman(enditalic); and (beginitalic)Crazy Salad: Some Things
About (enditalic)(beginitalic)Women(enditalic) by Nora Ephron. The
series is edited by Steve Martin, who insists that Perelman stole
his material.
</P>
<P>
   ``BE THE ONE''
</P>
<P>
   By April Smith
</P>
<P>
   (Knopf, $24)
</P>
<P>
   Cassidy Sanderson is a formidable woman - tall, blond, athletic
and savvy enough to be a baseball scout for the Dodgers, the only
female scout in the major leagues. The competition to find new
players is stiff, and when she gets a call from an old friend in
the Dominican Republic, she quickly flies down to see the ``pure
hitter'' he has discovered. Alberto Cruz does have talent so
Cassidy signs him and brings him back to Los Angeles, but soon
Alberto begins receiving mysterious blackmail notes. Flashbacks
throughout this novel reveal that the notes are tied to a
mysterious night in the Dominican Republic when Cassidy, Alberto
and a wealthy American businessman drove drunkenly through a
hurricane just before their return to the United States. The novel
is suspenseful and well characterized although longer than it needs
to be. Smith will appear at the Poisoned Pen bookstore. See Book
Signings for details.
</P>
<P>
   ``AN INVISIBLE SIGN OF MY OWN''
</P>
<P>
   By Aimee Bender
</P>
<P>
   (Doubleday, $22.95)
</P>
<P>
   Bender's odd but very effective first novel is narrated by
20-year-old Mona Gray, a troubled young woman who struggles with
psychological scars and obsessions even as she forms attachments to
some very strange second-graders at her hometown elementary school,
where she has been hired to teach mathematics. Emotionally affected
by her father's poor health since she was 10, Mona is the ultimate
unreliable narrator, her sanity seemingly so fragile that for a
long time we don't know what to make of her. She finds comfort in
numbers - they are the constant force in her mind, her only
reliable port in life's storm. In a voice that is both witty and
spooky, Mona tells us about her students, her family and her inner
life, hinting at potential violence even as she embarks on a sweet
romance with a fellow teacher. It's a mark of Bender's subtle
virtuosity that such a surreal story is ultimately so appealing.
She's a writer to watch.

<P>
   ``THE DAY JOHN DIED''
</P>
<P>
   By Christopher Andersen
</P>
<P>
   (Morrow, $26)
</P>
<P>
   Andersen opens this book by trying to justify it, alluding to
the ``ocean of grief'' into which we all allegedly plunged upon
hearing of John F. Kennedy Jr.'s death and pointing out Kennedy's
similarities to Princess Diana (which amount to little more than
that both were ``lit from within,'' and we were obsessed with
them). You'll forgive us if we tell you that books like this make
us feel squirrelly as if we're watching a bank heist in progress
and doing nothing to stop it. But Andersen has cased this joint
before (he wrote not only (beginitalic)The Day
(enditalic)(beginitalic)John Died (enditalic)but also

   ``FROM OUR HOUSE: A MEMOIR''
</P>
<P>
   By Lee Martin
</P>
<P>
   (Dutton, $22.95)
</P>
<P>
   This memoir begins with a ghoulish tragedy but becomes the oddly
uplifting story of the author's determination to understand the
dynamics of his own family. In 1956, when Martin was a baby, his
father, Roy, lost both hands in an accident with a harvesting
machine on their 80-acre farm in Illinois. Roy Martin was already a
coarse, difficult man, but his misfortune instilled in him a new
level of anger. Over the years, he beat and berated his son while
Lee's mother looked on. ``I was too young to know then,'' Martin
writes, ``that she was as helpless in my father's house as I.'' But
to dismiss Roy as a villain is to deny the complexities that exist
in unhappy families. Martin explores his own responses to his
father, and so takes his story beyond self-pity and makes it an act
of salvation. His book is an unflinching look at the bonds between
a wounded man and his son and at the stoic perseverance of the
woman who loved them both.

   Here are Anne Stephenson's capsule reviews of eight new books:
</P>
<P>
   ``AMERICAN RHAPSODY''
</P>
<P>
   ByJoe Eszterhas
</P>
<P>
   (Knopf, $25.95)
</P>
<P>
   We'll say right upfront that we felt as if we earned our salary
for the next five years as we struggled through this book, a
quagmire of gonzo posturing and other strange liberties to which
Eszterhas believes he's entitled. The former (beginitalic)Rolling
Stone(enditalic) writer, having made his money with screenplays to
such scintillating films as (beginitalic)Showgirls(enditalic) and
(beginitalic)Basic Instinct(enditalic)(beginitalic), (enditalic)
now shows us the real Bill Clinton or, as Eszterhas' friend, Jann
Wenner, called him, ``the first rock and roll president in American
history.'' Eszterhas was mesmerized by the Monica Lewinsky sex
scandal. He devoured the Starr report, watched it on television,
read about it in magazines. Maybe they are his sources for the
garish ``non-fiction'' sections here, but he never really makes
that clear (there are fictional parts too, including a chapter
narrated by ``Willard,'' the most famous part of Clinton's
anatomy). Read this at your own risk. And remember: No one's paying
you to do it.

<P>
   ``LOCO FOR LIZARDS''
</P>
<P>
   By Jim Cherry
</P>
<P>
   (Northland, $7.95)
</P>
<P>
   Lizards, Cherry notes, predate dinosaurs, continents, even -
gasp! - (beginitalic)S(enditalic)(beginitalic)trom
Thurmond(enditalic). If that doesn't leave you hungry for more, you
are a hard sell. This brief, well-illustrated book tells you
everything you always wanted to know about lizards and a lot you
could have done without but aren't troubled to hear, such as the
fact that a monitor lizard can run 10 mph to catch the wild pigs it
likes for supper or that its mouth is so full of bacteria that its
bite will kill its victim within a day or two even if it gets away.
Cherry also includes general information on lizards in myth, art
and advertising and in film (we were delighted to see not just
(beginitalic)Godzilla(enditalic) and (beginitalic)Journey to the
Center of the Earth(enditalic) but also (beginitalic)The
Freshman(enditalic), Andrew Bergman's comedy in which a Komodo
dragon gets loose in a shopping mall). This is a good book to hand
over to visitors from the East as they watch geckos skitter across
your block wall.

   ``POOR RICHARD'S ALMANACK''
</P>
<P>
   By Benjamin Franklin
</P>
<P>
   (Modern Library, $10.95)
</P>
<P>
   Early to bed and early to rise makes a man miss pretty much
everything good on TV. That's Ben Franklin updated by Dave Barry in
his introduction to this new edition. Barry is hilarious, in fact,
as he questions the wisdom of a few of Franklin's statements -
particularly ``if your head is wax, don't walk in the sun'' - and
heartily endorses others. ``Poor Richard advocates diligence,
self-reliance, frugality and honesty,'' writes Barry. ``He disdains
laziness, extravagance, pretense and immodesty. It goes without
saying that he hates lawyers.'' This is one of the first four books
in the Modern Library Humor and Wit series. Others are
(beginitalic)Mark Twain's Library of Humor(enditalic), with an
introduction by Roy Blount, Jr.; (beginitalic)Most of the Most of
S.J. Perelman(enditalic); and (beginitalic)Crazy Salad: Some Things
About (enditalic)(beginitalic)Women(enditalic) by Nora Ephron. The
series is edited by Steve Martin, who insists that Perelman stole
his material.

<P>
   ``BE THE ONE''
</P>
<P>
   By April Smith
</P>
<P>
   (Knopf, $24)
</P>
<P>
   Cassidy Sanderson is a formidable woman - tall, blond, athletic
and savvy enough to be a baseball scout for the Dodgers, the only
female scout in the major leagues. The competition to find new
players is stiff, and when she gets a call from an old friend in
the Dominican Republic, she quickly flies down to see the ``pure
hitter'' he has discovered. Alberto Cruz does have talent so
Cassidy signs him and brings him back to Los Angeles, but soon
Alberto begins receiving mysterious blackmail notes. Flashbacks
throughout this novel reveal that the notes are tied to a
mysterious night in the Dominican Republic when Cassidy, Alberto
and a wealthy American businessman drove drunkenly through a
hurricane just before their return to the United States. The novel
is suspenseful and well characterized although longer than it needs
to be. Smith will appear at the Poisoned Pen bookstore. See Book
Signings for details.
</P>
<P>
   ``AN INVISIBLE SIGN OF MY OWN''
</P>
<P>
   By Aimee Bender
</P>
<P>
   (Doubleday, $22.95)
</P>
<P>
   Bender's odd but very effective first novel is narrated by
20-year-old Mona Gray, a troubled young woman who struggles with
psychological scars and obsessions even as she forms attachments to
some very strange second-graders at her hometown elementary school,
where she has been hired to teach mathematics. Emotionally affected
by her father's poor health since she was 10, Mona is the ultimate
unreliable narrator, her sanity seemingly so fragile that for a
long time we don't know what to make of her. She finds comfort in
numbers - they are the constant force in her mind, her only
reliable port in life's storm. In a voice that is both witty and
spooky, Mona tells us about her students, her family and her inner
life, hinting at potential violence even as she embarks on a sweet
romance with a fellow teacher. It's a mark of Bender's subtle
virtuosity that such a surreal story is ultimately so appealing.
She's a writer to watch.

   ``THE DAY JOHN DIED''
</P>
<P>
   By Christopher Andersen
</P>
<P>
   (Morrow, $26)
</P>
<P>
   Andersen opens this book by trying to justify it, alluding to
the ``ocean of grief'' into which we all allegedly plunged upon
hearing of John F. Kennedy Jr.'s death and pointing out Kennedy's
similarities to Princess Diana (which amount to little more than
that both were ``lit from within,'' and we were obsessed with
them). You'll forgive us if we tell you that books like this make
us feel squirrelly as if we're watching a bank heist in progress
and doing nothing to stop it. But Andersen has cased this joint
before (he wrote not only (beginitalic)The Day
(enditalic)(beginitalic)John Died (enditalic)but also
(beginitalic)Jack and Jackie (enditalic)and Jackie After Jack), and
he knows where the money is. Happily, Kennedy comes off well. His
marriage was doing better; his rebellious youth was spent; and he
was, to all appearances, a good man. And we defy you to remain
unmoved at the description of the funeral service, marked by a
stunned and battered family's grief over another gone too soon.

   ``FROM OUR HOUSE: A MEMOIR''
</P>

</P>
<P>
   (Dutton, $22.95)

   ``WHY WE HURT''
</P>
<P>
   By Frank T. Vertosick
</P>
<P>
   (Harcourt, $24)
</P>
<P>
   It's unsettling, reading about pain. We suspect that any amount

migraine, you have a bad back, you're looking for solutions. But
this book, subtitled (beginitalic)The Natural History of

<TEXT>
<P>
   A peaceful revolution rumbled across Mexico on July 2, driven by
a charismatic reformer, a Mexican original who somehow combines the
cowboy self-confidence of a John Wayne with the Latin man-from-the
country earnestness of a Juan Valdez.
</P>
<P>
   With his thundering victory at the ballot box, Vicente Fox
Quesada , who will take office Dec. 1, defied not only six months
of political polls that had shown him in a tight race with the
candidate of the ruling Institutional Revolutionary Party. He also
broke the spell of seven decades of Mexican history that had seen
the party dominate the political and psychological landscape.
</P>
<P>
   Peruvian writer Mario Vargas Llosa said the PRI had erected
``the perfect dictatorship.'' Until Fox's stunning victory, power
was handed down by presidents who named their successors. an
imperial gesture that made elections empty rituals. Party boss and
labor leader Fidel Velasquez once said that the PRI was so strong
that only bullets could drive it from Los Pinos, the Mexican White
House.
</P>
<P>
   After a night of celebration in town squares across the country,
Mexico awoke July 3 to a new political era. The Fox landslide had
broken the PRI spell. Almost giddy with delight, many are calling
the election their equivalent of the fall of the Berlin Wall or the
storming of the Bastille in revolutionary France.
</P>
<P>
   ``By making that old and corrupt system of power recognize for
the first time the triumph of an opposition presidential candidate,
we have achieved not just a new government but something much more
important,'' proclaimed historian Lorenzo Meyer. ``We have
accomplished a change in the very nature of our politics.''
</P>
<P>
   The victory was fundamentally the singular achievement of a
remarkable man in black cowboy boots. Vicente Fox captured the
hearts and votes of his countrymen by making himself the defiant
champion of change in a country that was primed to repudiate the
PRI. With his relentless determination and unshakable confidence,
he inspired Mexicans to imagine what many had thought was
inconceivable: life without the PRI in the presidency.
</P>
<P>
   Fox's triumph, on his 58th birthday, culminated a long political
journey that was propelled by his father's appetite for hard work,
his spirit of social engagement instilled by the Jesuits, his
growing fury with PRI arrogance and corruption and his powerful
sense of destiny as an agent of change.
</P>
<P>
   Fox, the grandson of an Irish-American from Ohio, was born in
1942, the second of nine children in a family that owned a ranch
and farm in the central Mexican state of Guanajato. He recalls his
father as an intense, joyful man with a determined appetite for
work. ``It didn't matter what time the party ended, at 6 o'clock in
the morning - in the days before Alka-Seltzer - he was up and
working.'' Fox wrote in his autobiography.
</P>
<P>
   After completing his studies at the Jesuit-operated Universidad
Iberoamericana in Mexico City, Fox began work in 1964 for
Coca-Cola. He advanced steadily from his earliest days as a route
driver, becoming the company's marketing director in Mexico and
ultimately the head of its operations in that country. Coke sent
him to Harvard for a graduate education in business.
</P>
<P>
   But Fox always felt himself drawn to a life of social
engagement. When he was not helping Coke overtake Pepsi as the top
seller of soft drinks in Mexico, he was helping found
rehabilitation centers for alcoholics and addicts. He and his
then-wife, who adopted their four children, would later help to
found an orphanage.
</P>
<P>
   ``In a big company like Coca-Cola, there isn't much that one can
accomplish in terms of personal satisfaction,'' Fox said. In 1974,
at a college reunion, one of the Jesuits who taught at the
university fortified Fox's resolve to leave Coca-Cola. The Rev.
Xavier Scheifler stunned the group when he angrily chastised them
for ignoring social responsibilities in their quest for individual
gain.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was an experience that solidified my conviction that I
should work with others, for others,'' Fox wrote. Five years later,
he turned down a promotion that would have made him Coke's top man
for all of Latin America. He decided to return home to the state of
Guanajuato, where his family was branching out from farming into
pigs, stables and cowboy boots.
</P>
<P>
   The demand for boots exploded after John Travolta's
(beginitalic)Urban Cowboy(enditalic) movie made Western fashion a
fad across the United States. But after bringing the Fox craftsmen
a brief flood of orders from around the world, the boom quickly
faded, leaving them stuck with merchandise they couldn't sell. Fox
recalls that the downturn cost the family about $1.5 million.
</P>
<P>
   The upheaval that Travolta brought to the Fox family was nothing
compared to the influence of a brashly self-confident vegetable
farmer from the state of Sinaloa who in 1988 ran for the presidency
under the banner of the conservative National Action Party, or PAN.
Big, bearded and blunt, he was Manuel Clouthier, one of the
so-called broncos who were determined to buck the PRI.
</P>
<P>
   This was a time of seismic rumblings in the political terrain, a
shaking that would eventually produce the Fox earthquake of 2000.
The Mexico City newspaper (beginitalic)El
(enditalic)(beginitalic)Universal (enditalic)was reporting on a
``democratic awakening'' to challenge the political order. Octavio
Paz, the writer and intellectual and unofficial conscience of
Mexico, declared that the country had begun ``a gradual,
irreversible change toward modern democracy.''
</P>
<P>
   The most determined revolt against the PRI was under way in
Chihuahua, where furious Panistas had begun taking to the streets
in 1986 to protest a massive PRI steal-the-vote campaign that had
hijacked the governor's election. They seized bridges connecting
Juarez to El Paso, drawing international attention as they mocked
the PRI's claim to have won through elections that were ``clean and
transparent.''
</P>
<P>
   Clouthier became the passionate leader of Mexican outrage. With
a bold fury that astonished Mexico, he denounced the PRI and
proclaimed his determination to ``return national sovereignty to
where it must reside, in the people themselves.''
</P>
<P>
   Among the fresh troops whom Clouthier summoned to political
battle was Vicente Fox, who recalls a call he received from the big
Sinaloan, urging that Fox get involved politically.
</P>
<P>
   ``He told me, `Listen, Fox, we're always complaining about the
system, about the dishonesty, the corruption,''' Fox recalls, ``But
we don't do anything to change it. Let's do it now.''
</P>
<P>
   Clouthier, who died in a 1989 traffic wreck that his family
believes was a PRI-sponsored assassination, became Fox's political
patron. Clouthier inspired Fox to undertake a 1988 run for the
Chamber of Deputies, the lower house of the federal legislature.
One of Fox's first acts there was to ridicule as fraudulent the
election of President Carlos Salinas de Gortari.
</P>
<P>
   Fox took two allegedly bogus ballots, rolled them into cones,
then taped them to the sides of his head in mockery of Salinas'
oversized ears. Then, acting as if he was Salinas, he offered an
explanation of the electoral trickery.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've felt obligated to ask many of my friends to set aside
moral scruples to help me achieve this victory, which I had to do
because Mexico isn't ready for democracy,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Fox's show reportedly infuriated Salinas and likely sparked the
all-out PRI effort to challenge Fox in his 1991 bid to become
governor of Guanajuato. When the PRI-dominated electoral commission
reported a PRI victory, Fox led thousands of supporters into the
streets and offered evidence of well-practiced PRI tactics of
ballot box stuffing and voter intimidation.
</P>
<P>
   ``This government is a criminal organization that used Mafia
tactics of electoral engineering,'' Fox said in a thundering voice.
``They bought votes; they threatened to throw people out of their
jobs if they didn't vote for the official party. They told taxi
drivers they would lose their licenses. They annulled our votes.''
</P>
<P>
   The Fox-led protests threw the state into turmoil and forced
Salinas to ask his machine candidate to resign. But rather than
concede to Fox, Salinas arranged for the PRI-dominated state
legislature to appoint another Panista as governor. Fox would run
again three years later and win an overwhelming victory.
</P>
<P>
   He was, by all accounts, a successful governor, who attacked
unemployment by promoting business development and attracting
investment. He also showed a spirit of inclusiveness and
reconciliation by naming a PRI member to be the state's minister of
finance.
</P>
<P>
   Fox is, above all, a pragmatist. He avoids being backed into
ideological corners and works to build consensus. On the evening of
July 2, when it had become clear that he would be Mexico's next
president, he made a magnanimous statement, promising that his
administration would be ``inclusive and pluralistic.''
</P>
<P>
   Fox remains the crusading idealist. He has vowed to take on
corrupt cops and judges, to build the economy from the bottom up by
providing loans to small businesses that have long been denied bank
credits. He vows that he will appoint ministers because of their
competence rather than their political capital
</P>
<P>
   Said Adolfo Aguilar Zinser, one of the Mexican liberals who
rallied to Fox's banner, ``He is going to breathe new life into a
country that for too long was politically demoralized by the PRI.''

Guanajuato, where his family was branching out from farming into
pigs, stables and cowboy boots.
</P>
<P>
   The demand for boots exploded after John Travolta's
(beginitalic)Urban Cowboy(enditalic) movie made Western fashion a
fad across the United States. But after bringing the Fox craftsmen
a brief flood of orders from around the world, the boom quickly
faded, leaving them stuck with merchandise they couldn't sell. Fox
recalls that the downturn cost the family about $1.5 million.
</P>
<P>
   The upheaval that Travolta brought to the Fox family was nothing
compared to the influence of a brashly self-confident vegetable
farmer from the state of Sinaloa who in 1988 ran for the presidency
under the banner of the conservative National Action Party, or PAN.
Big, bearded and blunt, he was Manuel Clouthier, one of the
so-called broncos who were determined to buck the PRI.
</P>
<P>
   This was a time of seismic rumblings in the political terrain, a
shaking that would eventually produce the Fox earthquake of 2000.
The Mexico City newspaper (beginitalic)El
(enditalic)(beginitalic)Universal (enditalic)was reporting on a
``democratic awakening'' to challenge the political order. Octavio
Paz, the writer and intellectual and unofficial conscience of
Mexico, declared that the country had begun ``a gradual,
irreversible change toward modern democracy.''
</P>
<P>
   The most determined revolt against the PRI was under way in
Chihuahua, where furious Panistas had begun taking to the streets
in 1986 to protest a massive PRI steal-the-vote campaign that had
hijacked the governor's election. They seized bridges connecting
Juarez to El Paso, drawing international attention as they mocked
the PRI's claim to have won through elections that were ``clean and
transparent.''
</P>
<P>
   Clouthier became the passionate leader of Mexican outrage. With
a bold fury that astonished Mexico, he denounced the PRI and
proclaimed his determination to ``return national sovereignty to
where it must reside, in the people themselves.''
</P>
<P>
   Among the fresh troops whom Clouthier summoned to political
battle was Vicente Fox, who recalls a call he received from the big
Sinaloan, urging that Fox get involved politically.
</P>
<P>
   ``He told me, `Listen, Fox, we're always complaining about the
system, about the dishonesty, the corruption,''' Fox recalls, ``But
we don't do anything to change it. Let's do it now.''
</P>
<P>
   Clouthier, who died in a 1989 traffic wreck that his family
believes was a PRI-sponsored assassination, became Fox's political
patron. Clouthier inspired Fox to undertake a 1988 run for the
Chamber of Deputies, the lower house of the federal legislature.
One of Fox's first acts there was to ridicule as fraudulent the
election of President Carlos Salinas de Gortari.
</P>
<P>
   Fox took two allegedly bogus ballots, rolled them into cones,
then taped them to the sides of his head in mockery of Salinas'
oversized ears. Then, acting as if he was Salinas, he offered an
explanation of the electoral trickery.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've felt obligated to ask many of my friends to set aside
moral scruples to help me achieve this victory, which I had to do
because Mexico isn't ready for democracy,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Fox's show reportedly infuriated Salinas and likely sparked the
all-out PRI effort to challenge Fox in his 1991 bid to become
governor of Guanajuato. When the PRI-dominated electoral commission
reported a PRI victory, Fox led thousands of supporters into the
streets and offered evidence of well-practiced PRI tactics of
ballot box stuffing and voter intimidation.
</P>
<P>
   ``This government is a criminal organization that used Mafia
tactics of electoral engineering,'' Fox said in a thundering voice.
``They bought votes; they threatened to throw people out of their
jobs if they didn't vote for the official party. They told taxi
drivers they would lose their licenses. They annulled our votes.''
</P>
<P>
   The Fox-led protests threw the state into turmoil and forced
Salinas to ask his machine candidate to resign. But rather than
concede to Fox, Salinas arranged for the PRI-dominated state
legislature to appoint another Panista as governor. Fox would run
again three years later and win an overwhelming victory.
</P>
<P>
   He was, by all accounts, a successful governor, who attacked
unemployment by promoting business development and attracting
investment. He also showed a spirit of inclusiveness and
reconciliation by naming a PRI member to be the state's minister of
finance.
</P>
<P>
   Fox is, above all, a pragmatist. He avoids being backed into
ideological corners and works to build consensus. On the evening of
July 2, when it had become clear that he would be Mexico's next
president, he made a magnanimous statement, promising that his
administration would be ``inclusive and pluralistic.''
</P>
<P>
   Fox remains the crusading idealist. He has vowed to take on
corrupt cops and judges, to build the economy from the bottom up by
providing loans to small businesses that have long been denied bank
credits. He vows that he will appoint ministers because of their
competence rather than their political capital
</P>
<P>
   Said Adolfo Aguilar Zinser, one of the Mexican liberals who
rallied to Fox's banner, ``He is going to breathe new life into a
country that for too long was politically demoralized by the PRI.''

<P>
   Journalist Elizabeth Taylor's history professor once told her
that the perfect subject for a biography should be a scoundrel.
</P>
<P>
   A dead one.
</P>
<P>
   She took that advice to heart when she began her biography of
one-time Chicago Mayor Richard Daley. Daley fit Taylor's criteria:
dead since 1976 and known for the strong-arm tactics with which he
ruled the Windy City for two decades.
</P>
<P>
   (beginitalic)American Pharaoh: Mayor Richard J. Daley: His
Battle for Chicago and the Nation(enditalic) is just one of the new
biographies being published this year that probe the lives of
famous people from football great Walter Payton to the late
Japanese emperor Hirohito to American newspaper luminary William
Randolph Hearst to Jesus.
</P>
<P>
   Though novels dominate the book trade, biographies are a steady
source of revenue, one of the staple items in the bookseller's
pantry. Even Edmund Morris' offbeat 1999 biography of Ronald Reagan
couldn't kill the genre, though no other author has been inspired
to imitate Morris' controversial style of inserting himself
fictionally into his story.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is a fascination with people's lives and the time in
which they lived,'' says Terry Adams, an editor at Little, Brown &AMP;
Co., which published (beginitalic)American Pharaoh(enditalic).
``It's a genre that's of perennial interest.''
</P>
<P>
   Inspired by the nascent biographical genre created by Plutarch
(A.D. 46-119) in (beginitalic)Parallel Lives(enditalic), the
tradition began in earnest during the second century with the
creation of hagiography, in which monks penned the lives of
Christian saints as role models for their congregations.
</P>
<P>
   Today's biographies glorify both the mighty and the lowly. They
fall into two categories: serious, historical works (Carl
Sandburg's (beginitalic)Abraham Lincoln(enditalic), James Boswell's
(beginitalic)The Life of Samuel Johnson(enditalic)) and Kitty
Kelly-style pop-culture treatments ((beginitalic)Jackie
Oh!(enditalic), (beginitalic)The Unauthorized Biography of Frank
Sinatra(enditalic), countless volumes on Princess Diana).
</P>
<P>
   Though most subjects are well known, ordinary people can also
make for fascinating reading - if their story is compelling and
well written or if they rose to fame from humble beginnings.
</P>
<P>
   ``People are really curious about the famous, how they went from
obscurity to re- &QL;
</P>
<P>
   known,'' says Gayle Shanks, book buyer for Changing Hands
bookstore in Tempe.
</P>
<P>
   And, says Adams, ``It has to be a life that resonates today.''
</P>
<P>
   When America needs heroes, he notes, it embraces stories about
people like Charles Lindberg in such works as A. Scott Berg's 1998
(beginitalic)Lindberg(enditalic).
</P>
<P>
   As author Taylor learned, however, biographical subjects need
not be heroic. The Library of Congress lists 351 biographies of
Adolf Hitler, including 1999's (beginitalic)Explaining Hitler: The
Search for the Origins of His Evil (enditalic)by Ron Rosenbaum.
</P>
<P>
   Taylor, literary and Sunday magazine editor of the
(beginitalic)Chicago Tribune(enditalic), first considered writing a
biography of Mayor Daley when she moved to Chicago in 1984 from New
York, where she had been a correspondent for (beginitalic)Time
(enditalic)magazine. As she pored over public records and archives
to acquaint herself with her new city, she gleaned the importance
of Daley's legacy and saw him not only as a local politician but
also as someone whose influence spread beyond the city he embodied.
</P>
<P>
   ``All roads led to Daley,'' she discovered.
</P>
<P>
   In the book, she sums up his importance with one of Daley's own
quotes: ``This is Chicago. This is America.''
</P>
<P>
   Although legendary Chicago journalist Mike Royko had authored
(beginitalic)Boss: Richard J. Daley of Chicago(enditalic) in 1971,
Taylor and co-author Adam Cohen believed the definitive work had
not been written. Royko's book violated her tenet of publishing a
biography only after the subject's death and reportedly so offended
Daley's wife that she would walk into stores and turn copies of the
book to face the wall.
</P>
<P>
   Taylor and Cohen enjoyed the cooperation of a member of the
Daley family but did not write a whitewashed profile. Nor is it the
standard born-in-a-log-cabin time line of events.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is not a `what he had for breakfast' kind of biography.
This is not about his personal life,'' she says. ``What's
interesting is how he intersected with the world and with the
city.''
</P>
<P>
   Good biographies put their subjects into that kind of historical
context, says Sarah Gold, editor of forecasts for(beginitalic)
Publishers Weekly,(enditalic) the book industry news magazine.
Analysis helps acquaint the reader with the subject.
</P>
<P>
   An interest in famous people is more than just a penchant for
gossip, Gold says. Some readers gravitate to biographies as a
history lesson, making historical figures popular subjects -
Abraham Lincoln, George Washington, Benjamin Franklin.
</P>
<P>
   And new information can rekindle interest in an old subject.
When stories about Thomas Jefferson's slave mistress, Sally
Hemings, recently became public, Jefferson was suddenly a hot topic
two centuries after his death. In 1998, Joseph J. Ellis published
(beginitalic)American Sphinx: The Character of Thomas
Jefferson(enditalic).
</P>
<P>
   While biographical subjects need not be paragons of virtue, they
must have led interesting lives. A new biography of Cy Young, the
famed 19th-century baseball player who lent his name to a pitching
award, got a lukewarm review from (beginitalic)Publishers
Weekly(enditalic). Young might have been a great pitcher, Gold
says, but his personal life was never major league.
</P>
<P>
   Still, sports figures are always reader favorites. Last
September, David Maraniss published the acclaimed (beginitalic)When
Pride Still Mattered: A Life of Vince Lombardi(enditalic). Cyclist
Lance Armstrong, who beat cancer and then won the Tour de France,
has just published his autobiography, (beginitalic)It's Not About
the Bike: My Journey Back to Life.
</P>
<P>
   (enditalic) And just out: (beginitalic)Payne Stewart: The
Authorized Biography(enditalic), the saga of the golf champion who
died in a freak plane journey last October.
</P>
<P>
   (beginitalic) (enditalic) Lives of celebrated writers also
provide rich fodder for literature. In April, no fewer than two
books on Marcel Proust were published: (beginitalic)Marcel Proust:
A Life(enditalic) by William C. Carter and(beginitalic) Proust's
Way: A Field Guide to In Search of Lost
Time(enditalic)(beginitalic) (enditalic)by Roger Shattuck.
</P>
<P>
   One of the most talked-about books of last fall was
(beginitalic)Secrets of the Flesh: A Life of Colette(enditalic),
Judith Thurman's engrossing tale of the great French writer.
</P>
<P>
   Literary biographies can be a means of interpreting an author's
work, says Judith Sensibar, professor of English at Arizona State
University. Sensibar, a William Faulkner scholar, is writing a
biography that explores Faulkner's relationship with the three most
important women in his life: his mother, Maud; his nanny and former
slave Caroline Barr; and his wife, Estelle.
</P>
<P>
   ``The story is compelling,'' Sensibar says. ``My objective is to
illuminate the reading of his art.''
</P>
<P>
   Using biographies to illuminate an author's art has gone in and
out of favor, says Sensibar's colleague, ASU English Professor
Randel Helms. During the 1930s and '40s, that approach was dubbed
the ``biographical heresy.'' When Helms was in college in the
1960s, professors taught that biographical information was
irrelevant to the study of an author's work.
</P>
<P>
   But when the so-called New Criticism emerged a decade later,
biography was reborn as a means to understanding literature.
</P>
<P>
   Now Helms embraces literary biography. When teaching the poetry
of William Butler Yeats, for example, he notes that many of Yeats'
poems cannot be understood unless the reader is aware of the poet's
fascination with 19th-century Irish activist Maude Gonne, who
snubbed his repeated marriage proposals.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you don't know that story, those poems don't make sense,''
Helms says. ``You'd be reading them in a vacuum.''
</P>
<P>
   Also edifying, he says, is the life of poet Philip Larkin, whose
sweet, romantic poems belied his sexist and racist views.
</P>
<P>
   Biography will remain one of the standards of literature, Shanks
believes. Nearly two millenniums after monks invented the genre,
readers still enjoy snooping into people's lives, whether the
subjects are saints or sinners.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can't imagine that changing,'' she says.

   Audiences didn't know what to make of (beginitalic)Blood Simple
(enditalic)when it first popped up in 1984.
</P>
<P>
   In the era of (beginitalic)E.T. (enditalic)and
(beginitalic)Raiders of the Lost Ark(enditalic), here was a dark,
claustrophobic movie made on a tiny budget, with no big names in
the cast. The film's creators were two rookies: Joel and Ethan
Coen. The ``star'' was character actor M. Emmet Walsh, backed up by
an unknown actress named Frances McDormand.
</P>
<P>
   There was no way to tell the good guys from the bad guys. Every
time you thought you felt solid ground, a plot twist knocked you
off your feet. The whole thing just smacked of originality.
</P>
<P>
   But the style only seemed new. (beginitalic)Blood
Simple(enditalic), which was being re-released as a ``director's
cut'' in theaters Friday, was actually an homage to film noir, a
term coined by the French to describe American films released near
the end and in the aftermath of World War II.
</P>
<P>
   ``The hallmark of film noir is its sense of people trapped,''
Robert Sklar writes in (beginitalic)Movie-Made America,
(enditalic)''trapped in webs of paranoia and fear, unable to tell
guilt from innocence, true identity from false.
</P>
<P>
   ``Its villains are attractive and sympathetic, masking greed,
misanthropy, malevolence. Its heroes and heroines are weak,
confused, susceptible to false impressions.''
</P>
<P>
   Not exactly Steven Spielberg, is it?
</P>
<P>
   Some of the titles are familiar: (beginitalic)The
Killers(enditalic) (1946), (beginitalic)Double Indemnity
(enditalic)(1944), (beginitalic)Out of the Past (enditalic)(1947).
They are gritty, atmospheric films with reluctant heroes, scheming
females and ambiguous endings. They were underproduced, perhaps as
Hollywood's reaction to its own excesses.
</P>
<P>
   (beginitalic)Blood Simple(enditalic), which touches all the
bases, gained a cult following through video rentals and gradually
became known as a classic. After the now-famous Coens opened the
door, Hollywood walked through it, cranking out more noir-type
movies, such as (beginitalic)The Last Seduction, Red Rock West
(enditalic)and the popular (beginitalic)L.A. Confidential.
</P>
<P>
   (enditalic)Some were faithful to the noir style, while others
were simply made to look like noir while copping out in the end. So
as you watch (beginitalic)Blood Simple(enditalic), here's a
checklist of what makes good noir:
</P>
<P>
   1) Low production values - These are not high-budget
productions, at least in terms of lighting and sets. For the
perfect template, take a look at (beginitalic)Detour
(enditalic)(1945), about a hitchhiker who takes a fatal wrong turn.
</P>
<P>
   2) The anti-hero - The main characters have to be slow on the
uptake (Burt Lancaster in (beginitalic)The Killers(enditalic)) or
at least disillusioned (Robert Mitchum in (beginitalic)Out of the
Past(enditalic)). They're not motivated by honor or duty, but by
greed or simply self-preservation.
</P>
<P>
   3) The femme fatale - Here's where (beginitalic)L.A.
Confidential (enditalic)loses it, with Kim Basinger as the hooker
with the heart of gold. Noir women are almost universally evil,
from the vicious Peggy Cummins in (beginitalic)Gun Crazy
(enditalic)to the diabolical Linda Fiorentino in (beginitalic)The
Last Seduction(enditalic).
</P>
<P>
   4) Plenty of double-crosses - You can't trust anybody in a noir
film, especially the people you're sleeping with. Just ask Fred
MacMurray, who was charmed by Barbara Stanwyck's anklet in
(beginitalic)Double Indemnity(enditalic).
</P>
<P>
   5) A strong crime element - Most of the best noir movies involve
private detectives or cops. There are some ((beginitalic)Sunset
Blvd., Lost Weekend(enditalic)) that stray more toward the
psychological, but trench coats and guns really help set the mood.
</P>
<P>
   6) No happy ending - The hero doesn't live, or at least doesn't
escape jail. Despite Hollywood's penchant for pat endings, the noir
hero rarely survives the film, either because he doesn't tumble to
the bushwhack or he turns out to be a stand-up guy after all.
</P>
<P>
   7) Snappy dialogue - Edward G. Robinson to MacMurray in
(beginitalic)Double Indemnity(enditalic): ``Guess I was wrong.
You're not smarter, Walter. You're just a little taller.''
</P>
<P>
   There you have it. So head for the video store, and then
(beginitalic)Blood Simple(enditalic), and you'll know your noir for
sure.

 &HT;    `BLOOD SIMPLE' STAR TALKS(a) 
 &HT;    (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)(a) 
 &HT;    (EMBARGOED UNTIL FRIDAY, AUG. 4. PLEASE DO NOT USE UNTIL
THEN)(a) 
 &HT;    By BILL MULLER(a) 
 &HT;    c.2000 The Arizona Republic(a) 
<TEXT>
<P>
   The Coen brothers scored a coup when they recruited M. Emmet
Walsh to star in their 1984 low-budget thriller, (beginitalic)Blood
Simple.
</P>
<P>
   (enditalic)After all, he was veteran actor. And he really knew
how to die.
</P>
<P>
   ``I did six movies one year, and they killed me in five of
them,'' Walsh said in an interview. ``I said, `Are they hiring me
because I'm talented, or because I give them a wide target?'''
</P>
<P>
   Walsh, 65, passed along his sage advice to another actor in
(beginitalic)Blood Simple(enditalic), which is being re-released on
the big screen Friday.
</P>
<P>
   ``I told (him) to die in a comfortable position,'' Walsh said.
``You're going to be there for three days. If you die in an awkward
position, they're going to have to keep going back to it, and
you're going to cramp.''
</P>
<P>
   If you've seen more than a few American movies, you've probably
seen Walsh, a noted character actor who has played a variety of
roles, from the deranged, can-shooting sniper in (beginitalic)The
Jerk (enditalic)to Harrison Ford's laconic boss in
(beginitalic)Blade Runner(enditalic).
</P>
<P>
   Walsh, who got his big break opposite Dustin Hoffman in
(beginitalic)Straight Time(enditalic), said he's always amazed at
how people remember his lines, like his graphic description of a
car accident in (beginitalic)Raising Arizona(enditalic), another
Coen brothers' movie.
</P>
<P>
   ``There was this spherical object in the road,'' Walsh's
character opines. ``And it wasn't a part of the car.''
</P>
<P>
   For (beginitalic)Blood Simple(enditalic), Walsh gave some
personal touches to his character, a seedy private detective who
favored yellow leisure suits and straw cowboy hats.
</P>
<P>
   As a metaphor, Walsh kept acting even as flies landed on him.
That was especially hard in one scene, which included some not so
freshly caught fish among the props.
</P>
<P>
   ``Your instinct is to swat (the flies). It just drove you
crazy,'' Walsh said. But rather than lose a take, ``I just let them
play.''
</P>
<P>
   Walsh didn't have much of a take on (beginitalic)Blood Simple
(enditalic)when the Coen brothers first called his agent in the
early '80s. Joel and Ethan Coen were green rookies. They couldn't
even pay him. Eventually, he agreed to do the movie for a small
percentage of the gross, not that he thought there would be any.
</P>
<P>
   ``The character was kind of fun,'' Walsh said. ``I thought, I'll
flesh this guy out, this Sydney Greenstreet type of thing, and in
seven or eight years somebody's going to offer me the character in
a real movie, and I'll have an idea how to play him.''
</P>
<P>
   Walsh, who was filming the Meryl Streep movie
(beginitalic)Silkwood (enditalic)in Dallas at the time, made the
trek back and forth to Austin, where (beginitalic)Blood Simple
(enditalic)was shooting.
</P>
<P>
   Walsh said the set was a riot. The director of photography,
Barry Sonnenfeld (who would go on to direct (beginitalic)Get Shorty
(enditalic)and (beginitalic)Men in Black(enditalic)) had never used
a 35mm camera before. Much of the prop and special effects work was
done by volunteers from the University of Texas.
</P>
<P>
   ``Every time you turned around, they were reinventing the
wheel,'' Walsh said. ``It was like, how do you put rain on a
windshield?''
</P>
<P>
   The Coens were stumped when it came time for Walsh's character
to blow smoke rings. Walsh, a non-smoker, tried without success.
The Coens brought in a machine, but it also failed.
</P>
<P>
   ``Finally, the assistant prop girl, this little Texas farm girl
says, `Give me that cigar. I grew up with five brothers, and we
spent all our time behind the barn.' She takes the cigar and blam,
she knocks out a smoke ring{hellip}I thought isn't this wonderful,
this is the way movies get made.''
</P>
<P>
   Walsh, who won an independent film award for his part in
(beginitalic)Blood Simple, (enditalic)admits he never expected the
movie to take off. At the time, he placed its chances as ``slim and
nil.''
</P>
<P>
   ``They weren't lucky, but they were lucky,'' he said of the
Coens. ``You can't be 27 and 29 years old and make a movie that
good.''
</P>
<P>
   In the end, it worked out better than Walsh ever expected.
</P>
<P>
   ``Every time the Coen brothers do a new movie, they talk about
(beginitalic)Blood Simple (enditalic)again and they talk about
me,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   So what do they ask?
</P>
<P>
   ``Is he dead?''

   MEDIGAP (Phoenix) - Premiums for Medicare supplemental insurance
in Arizona often are two times more expensive as the premiums paid
by seniors in other states. Premium costs can vary widely from
state to state, city to city and insurer to insurer on identical
policies for the same individual, says a survey of premium costs by
Weiss Ratings Inc. We look at premium rates for Arizona and try to
explain the disparity in costs. By DELLA DE LAFUENTE. Story will

   PBS {ndash}(Phoenix) - PBS stations around the country are
airing an award-winning documentary about urban sprawl. Part of it
was shot in the Phoenix area, and two high-profile Valley residents
-- sports baron Jerry Colangelo and architect Vern Swabach -- are
featured. But the Valley's PBS station, KAET-TV, Channel 8, says
``Subdivide and Conquer'' isn't balanced enough to show before the
November election, when controversial growth-related measures are
on the ballot. Supporters of the Citizens Growth Management
Initiative say the debate is exactly why the public needs to see
this film. By KATHLEEN INGLEY. Story will move in the ``A''

 &HT;    MEDIGAP POLICIES WON'T BE CHEAP(a) 
 &HT;    (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)(a) 
 &HT;    By DELLA DE LAFUENTE(a) 
 &HT;    c.2000 The Arizona Republic(a) 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Arizona seniors dropped by Medicare HMOs in 2001 can expect to
pay higher premiums for supplemental insurance, or Medigap,
policies to cover prescription drugs than in the Midwest,
California, Colorado and Texas, but lower rates than seniors in
Florida and New York.
</P>
<P>
   Seniors typically buy Medigap insurance to help pay for health
services and prescription medications not covered by traditional
Medicare. About 13,000 rural Arizona seniors will be forced to
shift to traditional Medicare when Medicare HMOs leave Cochise,
Gila and Pima counties and most of Pinal County next year.
</P>
<P>
   But the cost of Medigap plans that provide a much sought-after
prescription drug benefit may push some seniors with fixed incomes
into financial distress.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some seniors will have to choose between buying their
prescriptions, paying bills or do they eat,'' said Martha Taylor,
coordinator of the State Health Insurance Assistance Program, which
provides counseling and information for seniors on Medicare and
supplemental insurance.
</P>
<P>
   Of the 10 standard Medicare supplemental insurance policies
offered by health insurers nationally, known as Plans A through J,
Arizonans pay the most for Plans H and I, starting at $1,644 and
$1,896 per year, respectively, with the most expensive plans
costing $9,681.52 and $8,619.75, respectively. Ten insurers sell
Plan H in Arizona; about half require seniors to belong to a group
plan.
</P>
<P>
   On average, Arizona seniors pay the highest premiums for seven
of the 10 Medigap plans, consistently ranking among the costliest
states, says the study of 38,000 premium quotes from 113 insurers
in 45 states.
</P>
<P>
   Data on annual premiums were collected from insurers for
(beginitalic)The Arizona Republic (enditalic)by Weiss Ratings, a
Florida-based insurance rating firm. Premium rate quotes are
average annual premiums for a 65-year-old man, the age at which
insurers are required to extend coverage, regardless of a person's
health status. (For people under 65 and those 66 &QC;  and older,
insurers are allowed to ask medically related questions and may
choose not to underwrite based on the answers provided.)
</P>
<P>
   By contrast, Arizonans pay lower premiums than seniors living in
Florida and New York, the study showed.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's counterintuitive to think that places like Phoenix and
southern Florida would have higher rates than larger metropolitan
areas with higher costs of living,'' said Melissa Gannon, a vice
president of Weiss Ratings. ``The risk should be less when there's
a high concentration of seniors, but it isn't.''
</P>
<P>
   Industry watchers and insurers say the price disparity between
Phoenix and other metropolitan areas is largely the result of costs
incurred for increased hospitalization and prescription drugs.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our customers are living longer, older and using their health
benefits,'' said Regena Frieden, a spokeswoman for Blue Cross and
Blue Shield of Arizona, which has 23,281 Arizona seniors enrolled
in two Medicare supplemental coverage plans.
</P>
<P>
   About 1,400 Arizona seniors in the Blue's Medigap plans are 90
or older and 43 members are 100 or older.
</P>
<P>
   At least one insurer, UnitedHealth Group, isn't seeing the price
disparity, says Bob Hussey, vice president of communications for
the insurer's AARP division in Minnesota. UnitedHealth provides
Medigap coverage to 40,000 AARP members in Arizona through its
community-rated plans, for which it charges the same premium
regardless of age.
</P>
<P>
   UnitedHealth's premium costs in Arizona are lower than its
premiums in other states, Hussey said.
</P>
<P>
   Medicare's 10 supplemental policies, or Medigap plans, were
created in 1992 by Congress to cover the costs of health care
services not reimbursed by Medicare. Benefits offered through each
of the 10 plans range from the basic, no-frills Plan A, which
covers hospitalization for an annual premium of $433.44, to the
high-end and very costly Plan J. The least expensive version of
Plan J includes a $1,500 deductible, a separate $250 deductible for
prescription drugs and a $250 deductible for medical emergencies
abroad.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the attempt by lawmakers to create standard plans with
uniform benefits that are similarly priced, costs to seniors vary
widely depending on the policy, insurer and where the seniors
reside, the study found.
</P>
<P>
   Taylor, of the state health insurance program, advises seniors
to shop around, compare premiums and consider an insurer's
financial health as well as premium costs. Given the rates charged
for plans that include prescription benefits, Taylor says seniors
concerned about costs might rethink investing in supplemental
coverage since the high premiums, $250 deductible and $1,250 cap on
drug expenses for Plans H and I and $3,000 drug cap on Plan J could
be better spent buying medications out-of-pocket.

<P>
   With two growth-related initiatives on the November ballot,
KAET-TV (Channel 8) has decided this is the wrong time to show a
new documentary about urban sprawl.
</P>
<P>
   (beginitalic)Subdivide and Conquer(enditalic), narrated by actor
Dennis Weaver, paints a bleak picture of housing developments
devouring the vast spaces of the West, with Phoenix as a prime
example.
</P>
<P>
   Stations around the country have aired or scheduled the film.
But KAET Program Director Joe Campbell said it takes too strong a
point of view to air in the months before the Nov.7 election.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just didn't feel that the issues that were raised within the
documentary were discussed in a well-rounded enough way,'' Campbell
said.
</P>
<P>
   The documentary's producer, Jeff Gersh, argues that his hourlong
film is well-balanced and that now is just the right time to show
it.
</P>
<P>
   The goal, Gersh said, isn't to assign blame for urban woes but
to ``raise people's expectations about what's possible.''

 &HT;    (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)(a) 
 &HT;    By KATHLEEN INGLEY(a) 
 &HT;    c.2000 The Arizona Republic(a) 
<TEXT>
<P>
   A KAET-TV (Channel 8) official says Valley viewers won't be
shortchanged by his decision not to run (beginitalic)Subdivide and
Conquer(enditalic), a documentary about urban sprawl.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are so many other things we've done on this issue
locally,'' said Joe Campbell, program director for the public
television station.
</P>
<P>
   (beginitalic)Horizon, (enditalic)KAET's weekday public-affairs
talk show, has covered the debate over how to manage Arizona's
explosive growth, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've done polls; we've interviewed all the mayors in the
Valley,'' Campbell said. ``We've done stories - about state trust
land, about Growing Smarter (Gov. Jane Hull's growth-management
plan) - that really are germane and specific to what's happening
here in Arizona.''
</P>
<P>
   (beginitalic)Subdivide and Conquer(enditalic) fails to show all
sides of the issue, Campbell said, a particular drawback when
voters will consider two growth-related propositions on Nov. 7.
</P>
<P>
   Producer Jeff Gersh, however, figured this would be one place
that would jump at the broadcast. ``For goodness' sake, Phoenix is
in the film,'' Gersh said. ``That's what's especially odd to me.
</P>
<P>
   ``Voters are smart people, and they make their own decisions. We
don't need the media to censor information.''
</P>
<P>
   Sandy Bahr of the Sierra Club argues that (beginitalic)Subdivide
and Conquer(enditalic) presents a varied view of growth woes. And,
she points out, it features interviews with Scottsdale architect
Vernon Swaback, who has worked with major developers, and sports
baron Jerry Colangelo, who ``could hardly be described as a
cactus-hugger.''
</P>
<P>
   The documentary's proposed solutions, though, are not without
controversy: setting growth boundaries, allowing more flexible
zoning, refocusing development on downtowns and creating more open
space.
</P>
<P>
   And those are among the hottest debating points in the two
initiatives:
</P>
<P>
   The Citizens Growth Management Initiative, backed by the Sierra
Club, would require cities and counties to draw growth boundaries.
Opponents warn that it's a recipe for high home prices.
</P>
<P>
   Proposition 100, part of Growing Smarter, would preserve up to 3
percent of state trust land from development. Foes criticize it as
far too limited.
</P>
<P>
   Campbell previewed (beginitalic)Subdivide and Conquer(enditalic)
more than two months ago, and he said he looked for a program that
would express a pro-development point of view, to air as a
counterbalance, but wasn't able find one.
</P>
<P>
   He said scheduling decisions are made independently at KAET,
which is run under the wing of Arizona State University. ``I've
been here 51/2 years,'' Campbell said, ``and I've never felt any
pressure from donors, university administrators or the state
Legislature, one way or the other.''
</P>
<P>
   Named best environmental film at the 1999 Telluride Mountain
Film Festival, (beginitalic)Subdivide and Conquer (enditalic)is
among dozens of productions offered to public television stations
through several large distributors.
</P>
<P>
   The National Educational Telecommunications Association, which
distributed the documentary, surveyed major stations in May and
found 24 out of 50 had scheduled it for broadcast and five had
recorded it for possible use. Los Angeles station KLCS has
broadcast it several times.
</P>
<P>
   Mary Lugo, a publicist who handled the documentary, said the
only lack of interest she encountered was from stations in the
Northeast and South that were put off by the film's focus on the
West.
</P>
<P>
   The Sierra Club helped sponsor a screening of
(beginitalic)Subdivide and Conquer(enditalic) in Phoenix and in
Tucson last week.
</P>
<P>
   Phoenix activist Richard Corton was among those who attended,
and he called KAET's decision ``outrageous.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought it presented a balanced approach,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   To Gersh, ``The question comes to mind: Which public is public
TV thinking about? Whose public television is it? Do they have a
particular public in mind?''

</P>
<P>
   With the candidate long ago selected, Republicans are just
passing time until George W. Bush gives his acceptance speech in
Philadelphia on Thursday night.
</P>
<P>
   Thus the convention has been so tightly scripted, down to the
minute, that it carries all the excitement and energy of one of
those Super Bowl halftime shows starring Up With People (only with
a much smaller audience).
</P>
<P>
   On Monday night, only about 13 million people, or about 15
percent of the television audience, watched prime-time coverage on
CBS and ABC.
</P>
<P>
   Surprises have been found nowhere. Bush's wife, Laura had the
proverbial deer-in-the-headlights look during her speech Monday
night. But somehow it made her seem charming instead of
overwhelmed. She came off a lot less scary than the steely
Elizabeth Dole did Tuesday night anyway.
</P>
<P>
   Hey, maybe the compassionate bit is paying off after all.

 &HT;    TEXANS QUIETLY PROTEST KOLBE(a) 
 &HT;    (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)(a) 
 &HT;    By JEFF BARKER(a) 
 &HT;    c.2000 The Arizona Republic(a) 
<TEXT>
<P>
   As many as a dozen members of the Texas delegation removed their
cowboy hats and bowed their heads in prayer Tuesday night at the
Republican National Convention to silently protest a speech by U.S.
Rep. Jim Kolbe, R-Ariz., the only openly gay GOP member of
Congress.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just didn't agree with that choice of speaker, and that was
my way of disagreeing,'' said alternate delegate Sue Hershey of
Amarillo. ``I was praying for our country, for the leadership of
the country.''
</P>
<P>
   In his four-minute speech on international trade, Kolbe didn't
mention his sexual orientation or the Texas protest.
</P>
<P>
   When asked about the contemplated protest before his speech,
Kolbe told (beginitalic)The
(enditalic)(beginitalic)Republic(enditalic) that he probably
wouldn't even notice.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are so many people moving around on the floor that
nobody would notice anything,'' Kolbe said.
</P>
<P>
   He said that Republican presidential candidate George W. Bush
would fight for lucrative free trade agreements with China and
other countries.
</P>
<P>
   ``Through free trade, we have exported our principles, as well
as our products - sharing America's freedom and democracy with the
world,'' Kolbe said.
</P>
<P>
   With his speech, Kolbe arguably became the most prominent openly
gay Republican to ever address a GOP nominating convention.
</P>
<P>
   But he said all he wanted to do was discuss free trade, his
specialty in Congress.
</P>
<P>
   The Texas delegates, more than 100 members in all, were
positioned in front of the raised podium, and Kolbe seemed to gaze
right over them. They had been wearing their straw-colored hats
during speeches.
</P>
<P>
   When Kolbe was introduced, as many as a dozen of the Texans
removed their hats and some looked at the ground. One delegate
placed her hat over her heart during the speech. One carried a sign
that said, ``There is a way out.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We're talking about family values,'' one of the protesters,
Larry Stevens of Fort Worth, said afterward. Stevens and others
were concerned that Kolbe's inclusion in the program would run
contrary to the party platform.
</P>
<P>
   The platform asserts that homosexuality should not be protected
by anti-discrimination laws in the same manner as race, and that
homosexuality is incompatible with military service.
</P>
<P>
   The protesters also had discussed the possibility of walking out
of the convention hall, but concluded ``that would be
disrespectful,'' Hershey said.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier Tuesday, Kolbe, 58, was honored at a reception by the
Log Cabin Republicans, a gay organization.
</P>
<P>
   About a half-dozen protesters stood in front of the hotel where
the event was held, and were surrounded by 40 Philadelphia police
officers. One of the protesters, Bob Kunst, said the Log Cabin
group was not pushing hard enough for gay rights and was ``selling
out.''
</P>
<P>
   Kolbe made a joke at the reception when he spotted about 10
television cameras.
</P>
<P>
   ``I never knew there was such interest in trade by the media,''
he said with a smile.
</P>
<P>
   Getting serious, he said he was selected as a convention speaker
``because of the 16 years of work I have done on the issue of
trade.''
</P>
<P>
   The campaign of Bush, who accepts the party's presidential
nomination on Thursday night, had said it hoped that Kolbe would be
treated respectfully.

<P>
   John McCain had once hoped to address the Republican National
Convention as its presidential nominee.
</P>
<P>
   On Tuesday night, the Arizona senator settled instead for
delivering a lofty, patriotic speech that earned the heartiest
applause when congratulating the man who defeated him, Texas Gov.
George W. Bush.
</P>
<P>
   ``I support him. I am grateful to him. And I am proud of him,''
McCain said.
</P>
<P>
   The crowd rose. Among the first to stand was former President
Bush and his wife, Barbara, the parents of the soon-to-be nominee.
</P>
<P>
   The Texas governor was not in the packed, hot convention hall.
He will formally accept the nomination when he makes his convention
debut Thursday night.
</P>
<P>
   But he appeared on video from Gettysburg, Pa., and praised
McCain as ``a hero whose straight talk and strong convictions are
admired across America.''
</P>
<P>
   Other speakers Tuesday evening included retired Gen. Norman
Schwarzkopf; 1996 GOP presidential nominee Bob Dole and his wife,
Elizabeth; and Bush foreign policy adviser Condoleezza Rice.
</P>
<P>
   For McCain, it was the end of a long path that saw him challenge
Bush for the party's nomination, then offer a faint initial
endorsement of his victorious rival, and finally reconcile and wish
Bush well.
</P>
<P>
   ``He is a good man from a good family that has, in good times
and bad, dedicated themselves to America,'' said McCain, the son
and grandson of Navy admirals.
</P>
<P>
   ``Many years ago, the governor's father served in the Pacific
with distinction under the command of my grandfather. Now, it is my
turn to serve under the son of my grandfather's brave
subordinate.''
</P>
<P>
   McCain's speech was not only a tribute to his father's World War
II generation, but a call to follow their example of sacrifice for
a noble cause.
</P>
<P>
   ``They fought for love, for love of an idea {ndash} that America
stood for something greater than the sum of our individual
interests,'' McCain said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Let us take courage from their example. And from the new world
they built, build a better one.''
</P>
<P>
   McCain's wife, Cindy, and his mother, Roberta, watched the
speech from seats off the convention floor. They sat one row in
front of former President Bush and former President Ford and his
wife, Betty.
</P>
<P>
   McCain won seven primaries, including his home state. He
released his delegates on the eve of the convention, freeing them
to support Bush. McCain has not specifically ruled out running for
president again if Bush loses to Democratic Vice President Al Gore
in November.
</P>
<P>
   McCain was greeted by the (beginitalic)Theme From Star Wars
(enditalic)when he emerged on the podium. The music was used
frequently in his presidential campaign, in which he likened
himself to Luke Skywalker's movie battle against the empire.
</P>
<P>
   In his speech, McCain seemed to offer a rebuttal to Reform Party
candidate Pat Buchanan and others who think that the United States
has been too prone to intervene in foreign affairs and sign global
trade pacts.
</P>
<P>
   ``Isolationism and protectionism are fool's errands. We
shouldn't build walls to the global success of our interests and
values,'' McCain said.
</P>
<P>
   Among the chief architects of McCain's speech was Mark Salter,
the senator's chief of staff, who collaborated with McCain on his
recent book on the family's military history. He wrote many of
McCain's biggest speeches.
</P>
<P>
   Salter ``is our go-to guy,'' said Rick Davis, McCain's former
campaign manager.

 &HT;    GOP DROPS CONSERVATIVE MAINSTAYS(a) 
 &HT;    (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)(a) 
 &HT;    By BOB ROBB(a) 
 &HT;    c.2000 The Arizona Republic(a) 
<TEXT>
<P>
   The Republican platform adopted by convention delegates without
discussion or dissent on Monday closes two important chapters in
Republican conservatism: a commitment to roll back the mission of
the federal government, which has been a Republican mainstay since
the success of the Barry Goldwater insurgency in 1964; and a
commitment to growth-oriented tax policies, which has been the
domestic policy anchor for Republicans since President Reagan.
</P>
<P>
   The platform does mention, from time to time, the need to limit
government. But the only federal intrusion it actually calls for
retracting is OSHA's ergonomics regulation.
</P>
<P>
   Contrast this with the 1996 platform, which specifically called
for abolishing four Cabinet departments (Commerce, Housing and
Urban Development, Education and Energy) and four agencies
(National Endowment for the Arts, National Endowment for the
Humanities, the Corporation for Public Broadcasting and the Legal
Services Corp.).
</P>
<P>
   The platform does advocate fundamental and important changes in
the way the federal government performs its mission: block grants
to the states, using faith-based organizations in the delivery of
social services, vouchers to increase choice and competition and
personal savings accounts as part of Social Security.
</P>
<P>
   But the platform does not challenge the existing contours of the
federal welfare state.
</P>
<P>
   And while the platform is quick to give the Reagan
growth-oriented tax cuts credit for the current economic expansion,
it places little emphasis on expanding them in the future.
</P>
<P>
   Growth-oriented tax policy moves toward as low of a tax rate on
as large of a base as possible, particularly for income taxes.
</P>
<P>
   This increases the incentive for economically useful behavior,
such as hard work, thrift and entrepreneurship. And it minimizes
government involvement in economic decisions and allocating
resources.
</P>
<P>
   George W. Bush has called for a growth-oriented,
across-the-board income tax rate reduction. The platform devotes a
single line to it in a prolix 73-page, single-spaced document that
manages to ramble on at considerable length about virtually every
other issue facing the nation or the world.
</P>
<P>
   No explanation of why it is needed, what it will do to increase
real incomes and economic opportunity, or how it is a centerpiece
of Republican domestic policy {ndash} which it clearly no longer
is.
</P>
<P>
   The platform also repeats the standard mantra about making the
tax system ``simpler, flatter and fairer for everyone.'' And then
goes on to call for 18 new or expanded tax deductions or credits,
for everything from adoption, to education, to housing, to elderly
care, to energy production.
</P>
<P>
   Simply put, just as Republicans have largely accepted the
Democratic welfare state, they have also largely accepted the
Democratic view that the tax code should be used to reward or
induce politically approved behaviors, or to alleviate financial
burdens. In other words, that the government should use the tax
code to advance its policies, rather than be as neutral as possible
in economic decisions and the allocation of resources.
</P>
<P>
   Political platforms are often dismissed because, in the American
system, they are not binding on candidates and officeholders. But
occasionally, they reveal important truths, as this one does.
</P>
<P>
   In reality, Republican leaders, in Congress and including the
presidential nominee-to-be, are not warriors against the welfare
state. They aspire to be more responsible custodians of it.
</P>
<P>
   And while they perhaps support fundamental tax reform and
growth-oriented tax cuts as an abstract goal, they find more
immediate political allure in manipulating the tax code to advance
a social policy agenda.

   &UR; BY MICHAEL KINSLEY &LR;  &QL; 
 &UR; (Distributed by New York Times Special Features) &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The real nominating conclave, of course, took place over a year
ago. You imagine a couple of dozen middle-aged white men in suits
gathered around a conference table in a dark-paneled room _
possibly even in Philadelphia, home of the late E. Digby Baltzell,
who chronicled the Protestant Establishment and coined the term
WASP. Let's even put a grandfather clock ticking self-confidently
against one wall.
</P>
<P>
   But it wasn't the Protestant Establishment, exactly, and it
certainly wasn't the Vast Right-Wing Conspiracy, with its sweaty
ideologues and overexcitable religiosos. It was something between
the two, more like a 1950s-style business establishment. Dynastic
within reason and conservative up to a point, but passionate only
in its belief that moderation in the pursuit of election is no
vice.
</P>
<P>
   The agenda was simple and businesslike: Bring in new management.
Focus on the bottom line. Make sure that the GOP doesn't blow it
this time through zealotry, as in 1992, or sentiment, as in 1996.
</P>
<P>
   Someone said: ``What about George's boy _ the older one, I mean.
The one we've got running Texas. He's totally reliable _ not too
bright, no strong views _ and he's a great pol. They love him down
there.''
</P>
<P>
   The vote was unanimous, and the word went forth. And suddenly,
seemingly out of the blue, George W. was the overwhelming
front-runner for the Republican nomination. Party leaders, business
leaders, religious leaders all swore their allegiance to a man who,
until five seconds before, many of them knew only as the man who
got to fire John Sununu as George the Elder's White House chief of
staff.
</P>
<P>
   It was an impressive display of power for a conservative
subgroup that had been thought of as a spent force. At first,
though, it seemed like a miscalculation. He was too dumb, too
callow, too inexperienced. But guess what? These guys knew what
they were doing.
</P>
<P>
   George W. wears well. He's not a total bozo. His scalawag side
and his sincere side are both appealing, both apparently genuine,
and the flavors mix superbly, each making the other digestible. His
comically aristocratic answer to doubts about his grasp of the
issues _ in effect, ``I have people for that sort of thing'' _
comes off as amiable anti-intellectual populism. His preppy disdain
for vulgar ideological passions and grubby policy details is
well-suited to a contented people in a prosperous time.
</P>
<P>
   ``Compassionate conservatism'' turns out not to be just a
cynical salesman's oxymoron. This patrician offer of vague,
high-minded stewardship is well-meaning and highly tempting. Its
emptiness may have to be proved in practice.
</P>
<P>
   Al Gore, as it happens, literally was chosen by a Democratic
variant of the process we imagine choosing Bush. In 1988, a group
of new-money millionaires convened under the name IMPAC '88 and
anointed young Al as the man to bring the party back to moderation
and good common sense. In that case, the nominating committee was
overruled _ for a while.
</P>
<P>
   Bush's nominating committee got to choose his running mate too.
You can almost define this group as those who think it's a damned
shame the country can't be run by solid fellows like Dick Cheney.
Living in a cocoon of such people, both Bush and Cheney himself
have the mistaken impression that this is a widely held view.
</P>
<P>
   Cheney was almost deluded enough to run for president himself
four years ago. Bush was deluded enough to think that no one would
take seriously all Cheney's far-right votes as a Wyoming
congressman in the ancient 1980s. After all, Cheney didn't take
them seriously.
</P>
<P>
   Gore's efforts to nail Cheney as a right-wing ideologue are fair
enough. In politics, you are who you pretend to be. But Cheney's
real record is that of an apparatchik. He always holds the views
appropriate to the time and place. Has he ever said anything brave,
or controversial, or even noteworthy? Now he's a compassionate
conservative. You bet.
</P>
<P>
   Bush's own impatience with ideology is more deeply rooted. He
shares his father's attitude that politics is a game, along with
the preppy ethic that one should be serious about games and casual
about life. The best thing about George W. is his non-neurotic
attitude that he's playing this game to win, but he won't fall
apart if he doesn't.
</P>
<P>
   The worst thing about him is almost the same: Nothing is at
stake except winning the game.
</P>
<P>
   So at this week's convention he is enforcing the absence of a
party line with an iron fist. ``Hard-edged conservatives'' will be
banned from speaking. All views are tolerated except for any view
that some other view is wrong.
</P>
<P>
   For years Republicans have scored points off the Democrats for
refusing to let an ardent right-to-lifer address the 1992
convention. Now they're practically doing the same thing. The
platform may say that abortion is the murder of an innocent child,
but, hey, no big deal! Those good folks who favor the murder of
innocent children are welcome inside the big tent. And anyone who
has a word to say against people who favor child murder had better
not try to say it here.
</P>
<P>
   Wisconsin Gov. Tommy Thompson, chairman of the platform
committee, does the TV rounds urging people not to take the
platform seriously. It is merely a statement of core Republican
principles, he insists bizarrely _ nothing anybody is supposed to
agree with, least of all their presidential candidate. Other
Republican pols insist that George W. hasn't even read the
platform.
</P>
<P>
   Now, that I believe.

</P>
<P>
   As someone who's hoping that Al Gore will win, I'm distressed
that an old college friend of mine has joined the opposition. No, I
didn't go to Yale with Dick Cheney. But I did go to Carleton with
Bill Hillsman. Two weeks ago Hillsman took over the Nader for
President media shop.
</P>
<P>
   Who is Bill Hillsman? He is the greatest political adman who
ever lived. It was Hillsman's ad campaigns that turned an obscure
college professor named Paul Wellstone into a U.S. senator and
helped professional wrestler Jesse ``The Body'' Ventura become a
governor.
</P>
<P>
   Now, even Hillsman can't make Ralph Nader president. But he has
exactly the skills necessary to turn Nader from a campaign
curiosity into a candidate formidable enough to elect George W.
Bush.
</P>
<P>
   Nader is currently polling nearly 10 percent of the vote in
California. That's almost enough to take the biggest state out of
Gore's Sure Thing column. And according to a recent piece in the
New Republic, if Nader gets just 3 percent to 5 percent in a
handful of other states _ Oregon, Washington, Colorado, Wisconsin,
Ohio, Michigan, and Pennsylvania _ Gore loses.
</P>
<P>
   Hillsman has twice demonstrated the ability to use 30-second TV
spots and 15-second radio spots to totally erase the advantages of
incumbency, money, track record, and organization. And he can do
this quickly. He came aboard the Ventura campaign only one month
before Election Day.
</P>
<P>
   Hillsman's ads are so good that they take on a life of their own
in the media and around the water cooler. That means his
candidate's ad dollars go much further than they're supposed to.
Hillsman's ads also create unprecedented interest in his candidates
among infrequent and first-time voters. These politically unengaged
people may see an ad and then go hear Nader speak. And a Nader
speech can be very compelling _ the first time you hear it.
</P>
<P>
   Hillsman's Ventura campaign generated the highest turnout in the
nation in 1998. I wouldn't bet against him doing the same for Nader
in those aforementioned key states.
</P>
<P>
   Hillsman's ads succeed because they don't look like everybody
else's political ads, and in fact don't look like political ads at
all. Turn down the sound on ``Looking for Rudy,'' the celebrated
spot in which Wellstone searched Minnesota in vain for his
ostensibly Washington-enmeshed incumbent opponent, and you could be
watching Roger and Me.
</P>
<P>
   Do that with his hilarious Ventura ``action figure'' ad in which
a little boy with a plastic 6-inch Jesse toy defeats a like-sized
Special Interest Man, and you could be watching a Saturday morning
Mattel spot.
</P>
<P>
   Although it's not as famous as these ads, there's another spot
Hillsman crafted for Ventura that Nader probably has already gone
to school on. Early in his work for Ventura, Hillsman decided it
was essential to counter the argument that Ventura couldn't win, so
why vote for him?
</P>
<P>
   Hillsman's radio spot had Ventura saying in his trademark gravel
voice, ``Once upon a time in America, there was a third party
candidate running for major office. He was a big man. Six feet 4
inches tall. He used to wrestle in his younger days. And the people
voted for him because they believed in what he stood for. So in
1860, Republican candidate Abraham Lincoln was elected president of
the United States. ...''
</P>
<P>
   If you're a Gore supporter and you want something more to worry
about, it's this. Bill Hillsman's previous political smash
successes have come in Minnesota. An unassuming guy, he has been
content until now (except for one brief stint as a Perot
consultant) to stay with local and regional politicians and leave
the national Svengali stuff to the Carvilles and the Morrises. And
in fact, he's viewed by these East Coast heavies as a bit of a
rube. Carville is not a rube, but he plays one on TV.
</P>
<P>
   Wellstone even replaced Hillsman with a D.C. pro, Mandy
Grunwald, for his 1996 re-election bid. So I think Hillsman is
motivated now to show that he can play with the big kids. He will
work extra hard to show up Al Gore's old ad hand, Bob Shrum, on the
national stage.
</P>
<P>
   What's special about Hillsman campaigns is that they infuse
something into the relationship between government and the governed
that every healthy relationship needs _ honest fun. Gore's people
can hope that this will be a hopeless challenge in the case of
Ralph Nader, who is not perceived as a fun kinda guy. But the Gore
folks shouldn't count on that _ after all, Wellstone isn't a lot of
fun either.
</P>
<P>
   And if Hillsman manages to turn Ralph Nader into a fun guy, that
will leave poker-faced Al as nothing but a figure of fun _ which is
very different.

<P>
   RE: Selling the '50s and '60s &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Returning to the office after lunch today, I was nearly run down
by a middle-aged guy braying into a cell phone while he rolled down
Lexington Avenue on a kick scooter.
</P>
<P>
   My first thought was that they were filming one of those Comedy
Central commercials that ridicule baby boomers. But I was
astonished to learn that these scooters have become all the rage,
as we used to say back in those odd and ancient days when J. Edgar
Hoover was considered a tough guy.
</P>
<P>
   Seems this latest trendlet started in Japan and spread to the
San Francisco Bay area, where the Internet hyped it eastward. Kick
scooters evidently sell to a bifurcated market: college kids and
adults born roughly between 1946 and 1964 (OK, and small children,
too). The fad is said to be driven by baby boomer nostalgia.
</P>
<P>
   Well, excuuuuse me, boys and girls. Please allow a charter baby
boomer (b. 1946) to provide some historical context here. I was
maybe 10 when kick scooters started showing up. I forget whether
this was around the time baseball gloves stopped resembling quilted
oven mitts and developed useful webbing. Incidentally, how did Pee
Wee Reese ever  &UR; catch  &LR;  a grounder with one of those muffins?
Anyway, what was I saying? Oh, right:  &UR; Kick scooters were
considered ridiculous and without practical value even in the
1950s! &LR;  You know what we yelled when some kid scooted by? ``Hey,
pal! Get a bike!''
</P>
<P>
   And do you know what I was really thinking today when I saw that
50-year-old scuffing past on a $200 designer kick scooter?
Geriatric skateboard! I swear, I mulled over the idea of calling
the Hemlock Society for a consultation.
</P>
<P>
   We aging baby boomers are constantly hearing advertisers and
marketers babble about our growing irrelevance. At the same time,
we've watched the popular culture that we created, as we bulged our
demographic mass through the '50s, '60s and '0s, devour itself.
Music, television, movies, attitudes, fashion, fads and philosophy
_ marketers have strip-mined the whole baby boom landscape. We're
scraping bottom now, folks. Last month it was capri pants _
remember pedal pushers? And now it's  &UR; kick scooters? &LR;  Give me a
break! This is a culture running on fumes!
</P>
<P>
   But who am I to argue with the pop market? Where there is a
trend, there is a fee. So let's free-associate here and tweak some
other candidates for profitable exhumation from the baby boom
graveyard:
</P>
<P>
   Think ``Betsy Wetsy Meets Depends.''
</P>
<P>
   Or ``The Revenge of Winky Dink.'' Remember the 1950's cartoon
program that sold plastic sheets that stuck on the television
screen so you could use crayon on it during the show? Imagine the
fun that a Winky Dink 2000 can offer cranky boomers watching
programs like ``The Capital Gang''!
</P>
<P>
   Try Cinerama computer monitors (three screens, thus tripling
sales).
</P>
<P>
   Flagg Flyers 2000. Remember those 50's men's dress shoes with
the leather-covered metal snap that replaced laces and were popular
for about three weeks? Reposition them as safety shoes: No More
Dangerous Bending Over to Tie Laces.
</P>
<P>
   Or appeal to the active lifestyle market and bring back beverage
cans that have to be pierced with a pointy opener called a church
key? Think aerobic exercise!
</P>
<P>
   Consider ``Mitch Miller Rapz.''
</P>
<P>
   Or cowboy outfits (``Draw your Palm Pilot and cell phone from
them holsters, pardner!'').
</P>
<P>
   How about a Mental Hygiene Classroom Films Festival? Hold it in
Telluride, maybe get the Hollywood Foreign Press Association to
have an awards dinner honoring classics like ``Is This Love?''
(1957); ``Girls Beware'' (1961); ``Highways of Agony'' (1969); and
the ``Citizen Kane'' of the classroom genre, ``Duck and Cover''
(1951).
</P>
<P>
   ``Duck and Cover'' featured Bert, the wise cartoon turtle who
warned, ``Always remember, the flash from the atomic bomb can come
at any time!'' Sporting a tin-pot civil defense helmet, Bert was
serenaded in the film by a jingle that suggested he was going to be
OK in the event of a thermonuclear blast. Bert ``never got hurt,''
the jingle went, because ``he knew just what to do. He'd duck! And
cover!''
</P>
<P>
   I've decided to skip this afternoon's marketing meeting. Just
brainstorm on your own, folks. Afterward, anybody who wants to do
some strategizing, I'll be home, sipping a can of Pabst Blue Ribbon
in my fallout shelter.

   If asked what makes a bowling ball heavy, anyone who remembers a
little high school physics might point to the tightly packed atoms
in the ball's resin or the massive protons and neutrons inside the
atoms. Resourceful as it is, that answer would not satisfy a real
physicist, because it does not explain why the particles have mass
in the first place.
</P>
<P>
   For most physicists, there is only one answer to the question of
why matter weighs anything at all. It is called the Higgs boson, a
peculiar particle that laboratories in Europe and the United States
are racing to detect. It would be one of the most sublime
discoveries in the long history of physics.
</P>
<P>
   After scientists at the Fermi National Accelerator Laboratory,
near Chicago, announced on July 21 that they had seen a ghostly
particle called the tau neutrino, there remained only one
undetected particle whose existence was predicted by the standard
model of particle physics. Without that final, confirming piece of
the puzzle, however the standard model could still be a castle
built on clouds.
</P>
<P>
   The remaining particle is, of course, the Higgs.
</P>
<P>
   The Higgs should manifest itself both as a particle and as a
sort of thick molasses of pure energy permeating space. The
molasses, called the Higgs field, is normally undetectable except
as the source of mass for all ordinary particles drifting through
space, from the quarks that make up protons, neutrons, planets and
bowling balls, to electrons and neutrinos.
</P>
<P>
   According to theory, violent collisions produced in particle
accelerators should jostle the molasses enough to shake loose a
detectable particle _ the Higgs boson. Capturing one would
demonstrate that the molasses indeed filled space.
</P>
<P>
   A Higgs detection on American soil would also involve a certain
amount of scientific crow-eating since, a decade ago, American
scientists told Congress that the nation absolutely had to build a
superconducting supercollider at a cost of about $10 billion, or
forgo being at the cutting edge of particle physics. But since
Congress canceled the project in 1993 amid cost overruns and
charges of mismanagement, scientists' estimates of the Higgs' mass
have fallen so much that far less powerful accelerators might be
adequate to produce it.
</P>
<P>
   One of those accelerators is Fermilab's Tevatron, originally
built in the early 1980s and recently upgraded at a cost of $260
million. In the bitter competition to build the superconducting
supercollider, Fermilab lost out to Waxahachie, Texas, where the
canceled project has left behind only a vast, oddly shaped tunnel.
</P>
<P>
   ``It would be big revenge,'' said Dr. Franco Bedeschi,
co-spokesman for an experimental team called the collider detector
at Fermilab and a physicist at the National Institute for Nuclear
Physics in Italy. Although Bedeschi spoke jokingly, the scars of
the supercollider fiasco are still painful for particle physicists
_ call it Higgs guilt.
</P>
<P>
   Peter Higgs, a British theorist, and others worked out the
mathematics of the particle in the early 1960s. But it was Sheldon
L. Glashow and Steven Weinberg, two physicists who had been
classmates at the Bronx High School of Science, and Abdus Salam, a
Pakistani theorist, who showed how the Higgs field could produce
mass in a particle theory that described the complexities of matter
in the real world. Glashow, Weinberg and Salaam received the Nobel
Prize for their work in 1979.
</P>
<P>
   The theory is based on postulated symmetries of nature.
Physicists use the word symmetry whenever they find that physical
laws remain indifferent to some change. Physical laws are the same
for particles moving to the left or to the right, for example. But
some of the deepest symmetries occur in an abstract space where the
properties of distinct particles _ say, an electron and a neutrino
_ can be interchanged. The most symmetrical and natural state of
this space, however, is one in which all particles have no mass,
meaning weightlessness, meaning no bowling balls.
</P>
<P>
   The Higgs field allows particles to have various masses because
it fills space like molasses, said Dr. Tiziano Camporesi, a
physicist at the CERN particle physics laboratory in Geneva and the
spokesman for a large experimental team there.
</P>
<P>
   The resistance it offers against particles moving through it
amounts to inertia, ``and after all, inertia is the manifestation
of mass,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The molasses is thought to have congealed in space as the
universe cooled in the Big Bang, the giant explosion in which most
scientists believe the universe was born, said Dr. Michael E.
Peskin, a theorist at the Stanford Linear Accelerator Center.
</P>
<P>
   Peskin, who warned that advanced theories that made all this
less dependent on the caprice of one particle would predict the
existence of even more particles, said the Higgs field could not be
detected directly. But by producing ordinary massive particles in
accelerators, he said, the molasses could be jostled enough so that
it spawned a Higgs boson, which would decay in a tiny fraction of a
second, making decay products that could be detected.
</P>
<P>
   So now the race is on between physicists at Fermilab and at CERN
to be the first to find the Higgs boson. The two institutions make
little attempt to conceal the stakes involved in the competition,
which could lead to a Nobel Prize.
</P>
<P>
   ``This would be like an adrenaline shot,'' Camporesi said. ``It
would be the achievement of my life, clearly.''
</P>
<P>
   The first chance belongs to CERN's Large Electron-Positron
collider, or LEP, which is approaching the end of its planned
lifetime this fall. Scientists there have not seen the Higgs yet,
but they are trying to decide whether to extend their run just a
bit longer to keep hunting.
</P>
<P>
   With a higher energy than the LEP, Fermilab's upgraded Tevatron
will have the next shot at the Higgs when it starts producing data
next spring. After that, the much more powerful Large Hadron
Collider should begin operation at CERN by 2005 or 2006.
</P>
<P>
   Physicists say all the signs point to a great discovery within
the next few years. ``Having hunted for this weird beast for so
long,'' Camporesi said, ``the day it is discovered I would really
be very, very happy. And probably get drunk.''

in the ball's resin or the massive protons and neutrons inside the
atoms. Resourceful as it is, that answer would not satisfy a real
physicist, because it does not explain why the particles have mass
in the first place.
</P>
<P>
   For most physicists, there is only one answer to the question of
why matter weighs anything at all. It is called the Higgs boson, a
peculiar particle that laboratories in Europe and the United States
are racing to detect. It would be one of the most sublime
discoveries in the long history of physics.
</P>
<P>
   After scientists at the Fermi National Accelerator Laboratory,
near Chicago, announced on July 21 that they had seen a ghostly
particle called the tau neutrino, there remained only one
undetected particle whose existence was predicted by the standard
model of particle physics. Without that final, confirming piece of
the puzzle, however the standard model could still be a castle
built on clouds.
</P>
<P>
   The remaining particle is, of course, the Higgs.
</P>
<P>
   The Higgs should manifest itself both as a particle and as a
sort of thick molasses of pure energy permeating space. The
molasses, called the Higgs field, is normally undetectable except
as the source of mass for all ordinary particles drifting through
space, from the quarks that make up protons, neutrons, planets and
bowling balls, to electrons and neutrinos.
</P>
<P>
   According to theory, violent collisions produced in particle
accelerators should jostle the molasses enough to shake loose a
detectable particle _ the Higgs boson. Capturing one would
demonstrate that the molasses indeed filled space.
</P>
<P>
   A Higgs detection on American soil would also involve a certain
amount of scientific crow-eating since, a decade ago, American
scientists told Congress that the nation absolutely had to build a
superconducting supercollider at a cost of about $10 billion, or
forgo being at the cutting edge of particle physics. But since
Congress canceled the project in 1993 amid cost overruns and
charges of mismanagement, scientists' estimates of the Higgs' mass
have fallen so much that far less powerful accelerators might be
adequate to produce it.
</P>
<P>
   One of those accelerators is Fermilab's Tevatron, originally
built in the early 1980s and recently upgraded at a cost of $260
million. In the bitter competition to build the superconducting
supercollider, Fermilab lost out to Waxahachie, Texas, where the
canceled project has left behind only a vast, oddly shaped tunnel.
</P>
<P>
   ``It would be big revenge,'' said Dr. Franco Bedeschi,
co-spokesman for an experimental team called the collider detector
at Fermilab and a physicist at the National Institute for Nuclear
Physics in Italy. Although Bedeschi spoke jokingly, the scars of
the supercollider fiasco are still painful for particle physicists
_ call it Higgs guilt.
</P>
<P>
   Peter Higgs, a British theorist, and others worked out the
mathematics of the particle in the early 1960s. But it was Sheldon
L. Glashow and Steven Weinberg, two physicists who had been
classmates at the Bronx High School of Science, and Abdus Salam, a
Pakistani theorist, who showed how the Higgs field could produce
mass in a particle theory that described the complexities of matter
in the real world. Glashow, Weinberg and Salaam received the Nobel
Prize for their work in 1979.
</P>
<P>
   The theory is based on postulated symmetries of nature.
Physicists use the word symmetry whenever they find that physical
laws remain indifferent to some change. Physical laws are the same
for particles moving to the left or to the right, for example. But
some of the deepest symmetries occur in an abstract space where the
properties of distinct particles _ say, an electron and a neutrino
_ can be interchanged. The most symmetrical and natural state of
this space, however, is one in which all particles have no mass,
meaning weightlessness, meaning no bowling balls.
</P>
<P>
   The Higgs field allows particles to have various masses because
it fills space like molasses, said Dr. Tiziano Camporesi, a
physicist at the CERN particle physics laboratory in Geneva and the
spokesman for a large experimental team there.
</P>
<P>
   The resistance it offers against particles moving through it
amounts to inertia, ``and after all, inertia is the manifestation
of mass,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The molasses is thought to have congealed in space as the
universe cooled in the Big Bang, the giant explosion in which most
scientists believe the universe was born, said Dr. Michael E.
Peskin, a theorist at the Stanford Linear Accelerator Center.
</P>
<P>
   Peskin, who warned that advanced theories that made all this
less dependent on the caprice of one particle would predict the
existence of even more particles, said the Higgs field could not be
detected directly. But by producing ordinary massive particles in
accelerators, he said, the molasses could be jostled enough so that
it spawned a Higgs boson, which would decay in a tiny fraction of a
second, making decay products that could be detected.
</P>
<P>
   So now the race is on between physicists at Fermilab and at CERN
to be the first to find the Higgs boson. The two institutions make
little attempt to conceal the stakes involved in the competition,
which could lead to a Nobel Prize.
</P>
<P>
   ``This would be like an adrenaline shot,'' Camporesi said. ``It
would be the achievement of my life, clearly.''
</P>
<P>
   The first chance belongs to CERN's Large Electron-Positron
collider, or LEP, which is approaching the end of its planned
lifetime this fall. Scientists there have not seen the Higgs yet,
but they are trying to decide whether to extend their run just a
bit longer to keep hunting.
</P>
<P>
   With a higher energy than the LEP, Fermilab's upgraded Tevatron
will have the next shot at the Higgs when it starts producing data
next spring. After that, the much more powerful Large Hadron
Collider should begin operation at CERN by 2005 or 2006.
</P>
<P>
   Physicists say all the signs point to a great discovery within
the next few years. ``Having hunted for this weird beast for so
long,'' Camporesi said, ``the day it is discovered I would really
be very, very happy. And probably get drunk.''

   Not since Anita Bryant has a morality-minded woman been the

   ``Dr. Laura,'' whose audience is estimated at 18 million, is
best known just now for having stated her belief that homosexuality
is wrong, to which gay rights groups have responded by lobbying
corporations to pull their advertisements from her radio show and
upcoming television series.

EVIDENCE OF INNOCENCE CAN COME TOO LATE FOR FREEDOM 
</HEADLINE>
   (The Week in Review)  
 By JANE FRITSCH   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Newly discovered evidence may seem like the unjustly convicted's
dream come true, but the reality is that such evidence rarely makes
a difference in the United States. Once a jury has reached a
verdict or a judge has ruled, lawyers say, the odds are
overwhelmingly against reopening a case, no matter how compelling
the new information is.
</P>
<P>
   And actual innocence is the least effective argument to make for
a new trial because it is so difficult to prove. Although the
recent use of DNA testing, particularly in rape cases, has produced
incontrovertible evidence of innocence in some cases, and has
forced the release of the unjustly convicted, most crimes do not
involve DNA matching. Most other types of evidence _ like
confessions or new witnesses _ can be argued away or ignored,
lawyers say.
</P>
<P>
   Judges are loath to reopen cases, and state appeals courts
dislike intervening on anything but procedural issues. Decisions on
who is telling the truth and what the evidence means are best left
to the so-called finders of fact: the actual judge or jurors who
saw the exhibits and heard the witnesses. It has always been
difficult to win by taking an appeal to federal court, known as a
habeas corpus petition; when Congress passed a law sharply limiting
such appeals in 1996, it became even more difficult.
</P>
<P>
   ``The chances of any petition are dim,'' said Larry W. Yackle, a
law professor at Boston University. ``It would be a real indictment
of the system if many were successful.'' He added, ``You wouldn't
expect a system that papers over its many flaws to give up the
ghost all of a sudden when it gets to a federal judge.''
</P>
<P>
   The bar to undoing a conviction should be high, said Nancy E.
Little, a lawyer in the appeals division of the Legal Aid Society
in New York. ``But the way it's applied now, it's incredibly
high,'' she said. The courts ``have a vested interest in their
convictions. I think it's very hard for them to undo their own
work.''
</P>
<P>
   Little is handling an appeal in the case of David Lemus and
Olmado Hidalgo, who were convicted in the 1990 murder of a bouncer
at a Manhattan nightclub. Another man has since confessed to the
murder and implicated a friend, but the original defendants remain
in prison. Despite some corroborating evidence, a state judge in
Manhattan said he did not believe the new confession and refused to
order a new trial. State appeals courts refused to intervene.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the odds, Little said, she has some hope of winning a
reversal through a habeas corpus petition. But the burden on the
defendant is high. She must show, for instance, that the decisions
of the state courts were contrary to established law, and that the
state court's decision was not just incorrect, but unreasonable.
</P>
<P>
   It is not necessarily the job of the federal court to reexamine
the facts of the case. The federal judge, in this case Jed S.
Rakoff, will be looking to see whether the constitutional rights of
the defendants were violated. One argument, Little said, is that
the defendants' right to due process was violated when the state
judge refused to grant a new trial based on the confession.
</P>
<P>
   Eric M. Freedman, a professor of law at Hofstra University, said
it is highly unlikely that an appeal based on newly discovered
evidence will succeed in federal court. Freedman, who is writing a
book on habeas corpus petitions, said he knows of no recent cases
in which such petitions were granted on the basis of new evidence,
other than possibly a few that involved exculpatory DNA testing.
</P>
<P>
   ``The finding of facts by the state court judge must be found
unreasonable,'' Freedman said, ``and they must make out a truly
persuasive showing of actual innocence _ and that's tough.
</P>
<P>
   ``The legal system tends to defer to the fact finders, whether
that's a judge or a jury,'' he said. ``There is inertia built into
the legal system favoring the first finder of fact.''
</P>
<P>
   The best route for prisoners like Lemus and Hidalgo is to come
up with new evidence that will warrant a reopening of the case in
state court, Freedman said.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, lawyers for the two thought they had just that when
they got word of the confession several years ago. Joey Pillot, a
member of a Bronx extortion gang, told a federal prosecutor
investigating the gang that he and his friend, James Rodriguez, had
murdered the bouncer. The prosecutor and a police detective looked
into Pillot's story, grilled him about the details and came to
believe that he was telling the truth.
</P>
<P>
   But Justice Jay Gold of state Supreme Court in Manhattan, who
had presided over the original trial, thought Pillot had concocted
the story to please the federal prosecutors, and refused to grant a
new trial.
</P>
<P>
   Now, lawyers for Lemus and Hidalgo need to come up with another
substantial piece of new evidence to have a chance at winning a new
hearing. That could be the testimony of Rodriguez, who is in prison
on another charge and is to be released in November. He has said he
will testify only if he gets immunity from prosecution.
</P>
<P>
   Robert M. Morgenthau, the Manhattan district attorney, has been
reluctant to give Rodriguez complete immunity. So, Morgenthau must
decide whether it is preferable to give immunity to a murderer in
order to set free two possibly innocent men, or to refuse immunity
and let them complete their sentences of 25 years to life. Either
way, Rodriguez will walk out of prison in November.

EVIDENCE OF INNOCENCE CAN COME TOO LATE FOR FREEDOM 
</HEADLINE>
   (The Week in Review)  
 By JANE FRITSCH   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Newly discovered evidence may seem like the unjustly convicted's
dream come true, but the reality is that such evidence rarely makes
a difference in the United States. Once a jury has reached a
verdict or a judge has ruled, lawyers say, the odds are
overwhelmingly against reopening a case, no matter how compelling
the new information is.
</P>
<P>
   And actual innocence is the least effective argument to make for
a new trial because it is so difficult to prove. Although the
recent use of DNA testing, particularly in rape cases, has produced
incontrovertible evidence of innocence in some cases, and has
forced the release of the unjustly convicted, most crimes do not
involve DNA matching. Most other types of evidence _ like
confessions or new witnesses _ can be argued away or ignored,
lawyers say.
</P>
<P>
   Judges are loath to reopen cases, and state appeals courts
dislike intervening on anything but procedural issues. Decisions on
who is telling the truth and what the evidence means are best left
to the so-called finders of fact: the actual judge or jurors who
saw the exhibits and heard the witnesses. It has always been
difficult to win by taking an appeal to federal court, known as a
habeas corpus petition; when Congress passed a law sharply limiting
such appeals in 1996, it became even more difficult.
</P>
<P>
   ``The chances of any petition are dim,'' said Larry W. Yackle, a
law professor at Boston University. ``It would be a real indictment
of the system if many were successful.'' He added, ``You wouldn't
expect a system that papers over its many flaws to give up the
ghost all of a sudden when it gets to a federal judge.''
</P>
<P>
   The bar to undoing a conviction should be high, said Nancy E.
Little, a lawyer in the appeals division of the Legal Aid Society
in New York. ``But the way it's applied now, it's incredibly
high,'' she said. The courts ``have a vested interest in their
convictions. I think it's very hard for them to undo their own
work.''
</P>
<P>
   Little is handling an appeal in the case of David Lemus and
Olmado Hidalgo, who were convicted in the 1990 murder of a bouncer
at a Manhattan nightclub. Another man has since confessed to the
murder and implicated a friend, but the original defendants remain
in prison. Despite some corroborating evidence, a state judge in
Manhattan said he did not believe the new confession and refused to
order a new trial. State appeals courts refused to intervene.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the odds, Little said, she has some hope of winning a
reversal through a habeas corpus petition. But the burden on the

TALES OF RAW MISERY FOR AGES 12 AND UP 
</HEADLINE>
   (The Week in Review)  
(Eds: Optional sidebar at end of 2nd take.) 
 By TAMAR LEWIN   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service

<P>
   This year's most honored young-adult novel, ``Monster,'' grabs
the 12-and-up crowd from the very first sentence: ``The best time
to cry is at night, when the lights are out and someone is being
beaten up and screaming for help.''
</P>
<P>
   Walter Dean Myers' story of a boy in jail, charged with taking
part in a convenience-store killing, was a finalist for the
National Book Award, and the first winner of the American Library
Association's new prize for the burgeoning category of young-adult
fiction, an honor created as a sort of big brother to the group's
prestigious Newbery and Caldecott Medals.
</P>
<P>
   It's a long way from ``Anne of Green Gables,'' or, for that
matter, Harry Potter _ but, in its grimness, not too far removed
from many of the new young-adult books.
</P>
<P>
   Another National Book Award finalist last year, ``Speak,'' by
Laurie Halse Anderson, concerns a ninth-grade girl who has been an
outcast, and almost mute, since an end-of-summer party where she
got drunk, was raped, and called the police.
</P>
<P>
   This is by no means a brand new genre. Ever since the 1970s,
young-adult novels have featured a parade of America's
dysfunctional. And early on, there was a great hue and cry about
Judy Blume's books, with their frank discussion of sex, and Robert
Cormier's books, which dropped the happy ending. But just in the
last four years, young-adult fiction has moved into ever bleaker
territory. For example:
</P>
<P>
   _ ``The Facts Speak for Themselves,'' Brock Cole's book about a
13-year-old girl whose adult lover is shot, in front of her, by her
mother's boyfriend, who then shoots himself.
</P>
<P>
   _ ``Smack,'' Melvin Burgess' story of two British teen-age
runaways who move into a ``squat'' and take up heroin.
</P>
<P>
   _ ``Edge,'' Michael Cadnum's tale of a high-school dropout whose
divorced, upper-middle-class father is shot in the neck while
stopped at a traffic light.
</P>
<P>
   All fiction needs drama, and many beloved children's classics _
from ``Heidi'' to ``The Secret Garden'' _ feature protagonists who
overcome loneliness and grief.
</P>
<P>
   But in much of today's young-adult fiction, the miseries of life
are not just the backdrop, but the whole point. And while the
situations vary, the books sound pretty much the same, offering
first-person, affectless accounts of a troubled time, with little
description or artfulness. ``The envelope has been pushed and
pushed and pushed,'' said Michael di Capua, a publisher of
children's books at Hyperion. ``You need a bigger and bigger jolt
to keep people's attention. There's a big, fat, wide streak of
sensationalism in there. It's depressing.''
</P>
<P>
   There is no doubt such stories sell. But why they appeal to
adolescents, what their effect is and what they mean about society
are more complicated questions. ``Teen-agers and preteens have
particular curiosity,'' said Dr. Alvin Poussaint, a professor of
psychiatry at Harvard Medical Center. ``They want to know about the
world, what's really going on. They're sticklers for honesty and
they don't want to be shielded from reality. These kids are
watching `Jerry Springer' on television, and all kinds of violent
movies, and if they see these kinds of books around, they'll want
to read them.''
</P>
<P>
   But, he wonders along with many parents, to what effect? ``Does
it contribute to the increased depression we're seeing among young
people? We don't know, '' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Judith Rovenger, a youth services consultant at Westchester
Library Systems in Ardsley, N.Y., sees the gritty reality books as
a healthy, no-consequences way for adolescents to explore intense
feelings.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of these books are about people surviving at the
extremes, and that's very interesting to adolescents,'' she said.
``Kids who haven't been through any of these horrors still know the
intense feeling of being misunderstood. It's part of adolescence
that every child feels abused.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, Rovenger has her caveats. ``There's no book that's good
for every kid,'' she said. ``But assuming they're choosing to read
these books, I worry more that, if they're badly written, it will
numb them to good literature. And if gritty books were the only
thing a child was reading, I'd say lighten up a little.''
</P>
<P>
   For some children, books that reflect tough realities may be
helpful. Myers, the author of ``Monster,'' said he saw his books as
a validation for young people who do not find their situations
reflected in literary classics. ``My experience, growing up poor,
in Harlem, was that none of the books I saw had anything to do with
my life at all, so I came to the conclusion that my life was not
valuable,'' he said. ``I think young people have to have some books
that they can pick up and say, this is about me.''
</P>
<P>

 &QL; 
 &UR; BC-YOUNGADULT-BOOKS-REVIEW-2NDTAKE-NYT &LR;  &QL; 
 &UR; UNDATED: about me.'' &LR;  &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   But a too literal reflection of problems may not be useful, said
Robert Coles, a child psychiatrist who teaches at Harvard.
``Children in difficult situations ask the larger questions, the
kind of questions the Bible asks,'' he said. ``Why does this
happen? Why am I the one? I remember a girl I was treating who had
leukemia. She knew what was happening to her blood. What she was
worried about was what would happen to her mother. A book about a
kid with leukemia wouldn't help her. What would help her was
Tolstoy. A great novelist puts the reader in subjectivity, not
objectivity. This obsession with factuality has its limits and may
actually deprive children of an imaginative response.''
</P>
<P>
   And fact-based books are not the only way to tackle tough
issues. Certainly, fantasies like the Harry Potter books _ like
C.S. Lewis' Narnia series or Madeleine L'Engle's ``A Wrinkle in
Time'' before them _ deal with good and evil, suffering, love and
betrayal, albeit within a magical setting.
</P>
<P>
   L'Engle recalled an Authors Guild program on children's
literature in which New York City teen-agers were asked to bring
their favorite books _ and three out of four were fantasy. ``The
kids,'' she said, ``picked up on the unspoken assumption that they
were interested in reading about problems like neglect and abuse,
and they said, `No, we're living that, why would we want to read
about it?'''

   A taste of grim reading for young adults from 1898, from ``Paul
and Virginia,'' by Bernardin de Saint-Pierre: ``The body was half
covered with sand, and preserved the attitude in which we had seen
her perish. Her features were not sensibly changed, her eyes were
closed, and her countenance was still serene; but the pale purple
hues of death were blended on her cheek with the blush of virgin
modesty.''
</P>
<P>
   A sampling of more modern fare:
</P>
<P>
   From ``Speak,'' by Laurie Halse Anderson (Farrar Straus &AMP;
Giroux, 1999), about a ninth-grader who has been raped: ``It is
getting harder to talk. My throat is always sore, my lips raw. When
I wake up in the morning, my jaws are clenched so tight I have a
headache. Sometimes my mouth relaxes around Heather, if we're
alone.''
</P>
<P>
   From ``The Facts Speak for Themselves,'' by Brock Cole (Puffin,
2000): ``The woman policeman says why don't you come in here, and
so I went. It was a little room with a table and some chairs. That
was all. Instead of a window, there was a big mirror. I wouldn't
look at that. I didn't want to see myself. I sat down and folded my
hands. There was still blood under my nails, so after a minute I
put them under the table.''
</P>
<P>
   From ``Smack,'' by Melvin Burgess (Avon, 1999): ``I got to
admit, heroin's the best. I mean, THE BEST. The others, well . . .
acid, your thoughts come alive and they start to live a life of
their own. Hash, your senses sort of wake up. But with heroin,
ahhh. You can just sit in a sewer all day and be sooo happy and
feel sooo good.''
</P>
<P>
   From ``Monster,'' by Walter Dean Myers (HarperCollins Juvenile
Books, 2000): ``They take away your shoes and your belt so you
can't kill yourself no matter how bad it is. I guess making you
live is part of the punishment.''

THE PLANE THAT TIME PASSED BY

   WASHINGTON _ A plume of fire about to consume a marvel of
aviation, a moment of horror frozen forever in a stunning image: To
Prof. W. David Lewis, who studies the history of technology, the
burning Concorde looked like a zeppelin for the new century.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's haunting,'' said Lewis, a historian at Auburn University.
``That long fiery path in the sky, it reminds me, not in detail but
in overall symbolic concept, of the Hindenburg.''
</P>
<P>
   But it is not just that both had a fiery end, the Air France jet
as it took off near Paris on Tuesday and the giant German zeppelin
as it was being moored in Lakehurst, N.J., on May 6, 1937. Both
supersonic jet and zeppelin, Lewis pointed out, were symbols of
national pride. Each offered luxury service for a wealthy few, and
both operated at times of rapid technological change that made
their futures uncertain.
</P>
<P>
   And both, it seems, are instructive about the difficulties of
predicting technological progress. It remains to be seen whether
the accident last week, which killed 114 people including five on
the ground, will kill the supersonic transports the way the
Hindenburg ended the promise of the dirigible, when it crashed
killing 35 people on board and one on the ground. But progress _
including, perhaps, progress in safety _ has bypassed both.
</P>
<P>
   In its day, the Concorde was the ne plus ultra of technology,
the edge of the envelope in speed and altitude. Thirty years later,
the envelope has stretched a great deal, but in other directions,
notably toward safety, comfort and reliability. And though the
Concorde still flies twice as fast and twice as high, the question
is whether it has been left behind.
</P>
<P>
   Predicting technological change is hard, and the airlines and
plane builders are not good at it. When the Concorde was new,
Boeing was turning out 747s, the world's largest plane, as a
stopgap until supersonics could become the mainstay of commercial
aviation, and Pan Am was talking about carrying passengers to the
moon. The moon is still there but now is unvisited even by
astronauts. Pan Am is gone. The 747 has only grown to carry more
people more miles, and the Concordes are dwindling like the last of
an endangered species: 20 were built; 12 remain. There are more of
every high-profile thing that flies, except maybe for the space
shuttles and the Goodyear blimps.
</P>
<P>
   Technology has advanced in ways almost unimaginable in 1976,
when the Concordes entered commercial service to the United States.
And while expectations may have scaled back in some areas, like
trips to the moon, they have grown in other ways, almost without
our noticing, especially in the ubiquity and safety of air travel.
In 1969, the year the Concorde first broke the sound barrier, the
total number of people carried on planes in the United States was
less than the country's population. This year, the number of
passengers is more than double the population.
</P>
<P>
   New planes carry entertainment screens in every seat-back. The
Concorde's design does not allow even an in-flight movie. Makers of
new planes boast that they will fly almost continuously, day after
day. The typical Concorde, in contrast, flies 3 hours a day or
less.
</P>
<P>
   The Concorde is one of the few examples in history of a
technology whose successor was slower. It bears a passing
resemblance to the U.S. nuclear power industry, which used a
technology that looked advanced and attractive in the 1960s and
'70s, only to seem, 20 years later, esoteric and not worth the
bother and expense. It is as if the airlines have decided the
tortoise is sexier than the hare.
</P>
<P>
   Flying is now safer than driving, taking the train or walking,
and almost safer than staying home. One reason is that airplanes
are now mass produced, and their failures protect each other. There
are, for example, about 2,600 Boeing 737s in service, and every now
and then, somebody finds something worrisome in one of them, like a
power conduit inside a fuel tank that has short-circuited and is
giving off sparks. But the result is a swift order to inspect the
other thousands for the same problem and fix it. In contrast, if
the cause of the Concorde crash turns out to be a generic flaw, the
population protected will be the remaining 12 airplanes.
</P>
<P>
   But in the grand sweep of technological progress, that may not
be a fair way to consider safety, or even a sensible one. ``If you
do take that approach, we'll never have any advances,'' said John
R. Deakin, a veteran Boeing 747 pilot and safety expert. ``Somebody
has to be out there on the bleeding edge.''

IN A PICTURE BOOK, CLUES TO A MASSACRE 
</HEADLINE>
   (The Week in Review)  
 By STEVEN ERLANGER   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   The women, many of them with their heads covered, peer
tentatively at the massive bound volume, studying photographs of
jewelry, shoes, socks, trousers and other bits of clothing. There
is no art here, merely suffering.
</P>
<P>
   They are searching for some evidence of their loved ones,
missing and believed dead in the massacre of Srebrenica, the 1995
murder by the Bosnian Serbs of up to 7,000 men, separated from
their families, who thought they were under the protection of the
United Nations.
</P>
<P>
   Since this book was printed on June 12, more than 1,000 families
have seen it in the company of local workers from the Bosnian Red
Cross. The book contains 1,756 photos with short descriptions,
showing the belongings of 354 bodies found near Srebrenica that
forensic experts have been unable to identify.
</P>
<P>
   So far, 92 families have recognized belongings of their loved
ones, said Balthasar Staehelin, head of the International Committee
for the Red Cross in Bosnia-Herzegovina, giving forensic scientists
a very good chance of making positive identifications. More
important, some families are closer to knowing what happened to
their missing men.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some families even have difficulty opening the book,''
Staehelin said. ``But for most, not knowing is worse than knowing
the worst.''
</P>
<P>
   The idea for this book came from Rifat Kesetovic, the director
of the Podrinje Identification Project, which was established 18
months ago to work exclusively on identifying the missing from
Srebrenica. The Red Cross financed its preparation and publication,
and is providing local teams to take copies to the families of the
missing, and to stand by to provide information and psychological
care.
</P>
<P>
   Srebrenica has become a metaphor for many big topics: the worst
atrocity of the Bosnian war; the empty promises of a West in love
with its own moralizing; the bureaucratic, murderous failure of a
United Nations trying to make peace without fighting; the cowardice
of Dutch troops serving with the United Nations who let Bosnian
Serbs overrun Srebrenica and watched them march the men away.
</P>
<P>
   For these women, Srebrenica is an unfilled hole exploded in
their lives. Of the 20,000 people reported missing in
Bosnia-Herzegovina, the Red Cross has only been able to resolve the
fate of 3,000, even five years after the Dayton agreement that
ended the Bosnian war.

ULSTER FINDS ITS WAY OUT OF ONE MAZE 
</HEADLINE>
   (The Week in Review)  
 By WARREN HOGE   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   LONDON _ Though the Maze prison takes its name from the suburban
village outside Belfast where it is located, it is an apt word for
a place that is so representative of the perverse paths Ulster has
followed in its struggle to find its way from war to peace.
</P>
<P>
   The brutalist fortresslike building ringed by rusted barbed wire
and studded with searchlights and watchtowers has drawn the world's
eye for its hunger strikes, riots, killings, mass escapes,
posturing paramilitary fighters and alumni like Gerry Adams,
president of Sinn Fein, the political party of the Irish Republican
Army. It held more guerrillas than any other prison in the world,
and the ruthlessness and political commitment of its inhabitants
made it a place where guards were often more endangered than
inmates.
</P>
<P>
   It has at once embodied Ulster's most evil instincts and shaped
many of the men now trying to guide its political future. Five
members of the new Northern Ireland Assembly were Maze inmates; in
a society of 1.6 million, nearly 30,000 were prisoners. Behind the
1998 accord that has brought stability to Northern Ireland is a
conviction that these people, once perpetrators of mayhem, can be a
significant constituency for calm.
</P>
<P>
   Eighty-seven guerrillas walked free last week in the last stage
of the pact's early release program, under which more than 400
prisoners have been let out. The Maze prison, which has held as
many as 1,800 inmates, now houses 15 and is to close at year's end.
</P>
<P>
   Seeing the bombers and killers come out the Maze's turnstile
exit is dreadfully hard for many residents of Northern Ireland,
since most of the crimes were recent, and for victims' families,
the memories are fresh. The released do not express regret or
remorse. Instead, they say they were participating in a war and
trying to protect their communities.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the question most longingly asked these days by the
citizens of Northern Ireland is whether the war that has cost 3,600
lives is finally over, and they may find some reassurance in the
shuttering of the Maze and the freeing of inmates who always
insisted on being considered prisoners of war.
</P>
<P>
   The Maze began as a prisoner-of-war camp on the site of Long
Kesh Royal Air Force Base to handle the hundreds of people arrested
and interned without trial in the early 1970s. Its Nissen huts and
tents made way several years later for eight stolid H-blocks,
so-called because of their shape, housing 100 cells each and
suitable for keeping members of murderously opposing paramilitary
groups segregated from one another.
</P>
<P>
   In 1976, a decision by the British government to treat inmates
not as prisoners of war but as criminals led to riots and a period
when the distinctive aerial photo of the jail became a norm on
television news. Inmates went ``on the blanket,'' wearing
bedclothes instead of prison uniforms, and started their ``dirty
protest'': refusing to bathe, littering their cells and corridors
with broken furniture and smearing walls with their feces.
</P>
<P>
   In 1981, Bobby Sands, a convicted IRA bomber, started a hunger
strike that cost him his life after 66 days. Nine other inmates
starved themselves to death before the protest was dropped, but
Sands became a republican hero and brought international scrutiny
of ``the troubles,'' as the Catholic-Protestant sectarian violence
is commonly called.
</P>
<P>
   Another aspect of the Sands case pointed to the future. A month
before his death, Sands was elected a member of the British
parliament from Northern Ireland _ the first indication that Sinn
Fein might be able to attract widespread political support.
</P>
<P>
   While the Maze _ or Long Kesh, as inmates often still insist on
calling it to emphasize its prisoner-of-war origins _ remained a
chaotic and violent place through the 1980s and 1990s, it also
provided many guerrillas with their first education since grade
school. The men largely studied political and social issues and
emerged from prison with so-called Free University degrees. The
Shankill Road, the principal avenue of Protestant Belfast, and the
Falls Road, the main street through the largest Catholic
neighborhoods, are now home to scores of storefront community
action organizations run by former prisoners who are trying to keep
youths from perpetuating sectarian violence.
</P>
<P>
   Through these years, the Maze developed into prisons within a
prison, with entire H-blocks in the control of the paramilitary
inmates. Prisoners elected their own leaders who negotiated
conditions directly with the prison governor. Prisoners won the
right not to be locked in their cells, and guards were forbidden to
search their quarters without gaining the commanders' approval and
a day's notice. In an unsuccessful prison break three years ago,
IRA men managed to keep undetected the 13 tons of earth they had
dug up while making a tunnel.
</P>
<P>
   Inmates showed their growing power in ways ranging from the
cooperative to the menacing. During the last two decades, 22 guards
and a deputy governor of the Maze were killed outside the prison by
guerrillas acting on information from inside. In recent years,
leaders inside the Maze gave the political parties representing
paramilitary groups the necessary go-ahead to participate in the
talks that produced the 1998 settlement.
</P>
<P>
   Talk has already begun about what to do with the Maze.
Suggestions range from destroying every gray brick of it to
preserving it as a museum, as was done in South Africa with the
Robben Island jail, where Nelson Mandela was held.
</P>
<P>
   Whatever the outcome, the closing is a powerful symbol and may
provide a hopeful answer to a question posed at the end of a
popular republican song of the 1970s. ``And will the last
obscenity,'' it concluded, ``be the grim H-block cell?''

Falls Road, the main street through the largest Catholic
neighborhoods, are now home to scores of storefront community
action organizations run by former prisoners who are trying to keep
youths from perpetuating sectarian violence.
</P>
<P>
   Through these years, the Maze developed into prisons within a
prison, with entire H-blocks in the control of the paramilitary
inmates. Prisoners elected their own leaders who negotiated
conditions directly with the prison governor. Prisoners won the
right not to be locked in their cells, and guards were forbidden to
search their quarters without gaining the commanders' approval and
a day's notice. In an unsuccessful prison break three years ago,
IRA men managed to keep undetected the 13 tons of earth they had
dug up while making a tunnel.
</P>
<P>
   Inmates showed their growing power in ways ranging from the
cooperative to the menacing. During the last two decades, 22 guards
and a deputy governor of the Maze were killed outside the prison by
guerrillas acting on information from inside. In recent years,
leaders inside the Maze gave the political parties representing
paramilitary groups the necessary go-ahead to participate in the
talks that produced the 1998 settlement.
</P>
<P>
   Talk has already begun about what to do with the Maze.
Suggestions range from destroying every gray brick of it to
preserving it as a museum, as was done in South Africa with the
Robben Island jail, where Nelson Mandela was held.
</P>
<P>
   Whatever the outcome, the closing is a powerful symbol and may
provide a hopeful answer to a question posed at the end of a
popular republican song of the 1970s. ``And will the last
obscenity,'' it concluded, ``be the grim H-block cell?''

<P>
   The stakes, U.S. officials warned, had never been higher. To
many looking in from the outside, it seemed to be make or break,
peace or war. The brink, they feared, was right there: On the other
side lay chaos, confrontation and bloodshed.
</P>
<P>
   But the dirty little secret of the 14-day Camp David Middle East
peace summit is that the brink was a myth. The meeting failed; the
two sides went home without agreement. Yet no explosion in Israel
or the Palestinian territories occurred, nor is chaos expected any
time soon. This is because not only was the brink a myth; so, too,
were the fears. In truth, it was never failure of the summit that
brought with it the risk of violence. It was success.
</P>
<P>
   It is sudden compromise that really violates expectations in the
Middle East in a way that brings out the dark, violent forces
there. Now that Yasser Arafat has resisted a deal, he is hailed by
Palestinians as a hero. Now that Ehud Barak did not actually give
anything away, the Israeli government he leads is expected to
survive a no-confidence motion this week. But that does not mean
the two sides are farther apart than before. They have never been
closer.
</P>
<P>
   This is the paradox of Middle East peacemaking. Going slowly
produces impatience and despondence but moving quickly is simply
impossible. Camp David had the trappings of a go-for-broke meeting,
but it was just one more step in a process of mutual recognition
and adjustment begun in Oslo seven years ago. Its failure does not
derail that process. It is part of it.
</P>
<P>
   ``The lesson from Camp David is that the alternative to
negotiations is not necessarily confrontation and bloodshed but
more negotiations,'' said Daniel Ben-Simon, an analyst with the
liberal Israeli newspaper Haaretz.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, Israeli and Palestinian negotiators scheduled new
meetings on the Israeli-Gaza Strip border. Security chiefs of the
two sides kept in daily contact to prevent violence.
</P>
<P>
   Khalil Shikaki, who directs the Palestinian Center for Policy
and Survey Research in Ramallah on the West Bank, agrees that
peacemaking is far from over. He argues that the Oslo process
showed the two sides that a partial deal was feasible and might be
the solution for a longer time than many would like. This means
that no solution is likely to emerge soon on sovereignty over the
holy sites in Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
   ``Arafat is going to be in good political shape for some time to
come,'' Shikaki said. ``Even if there is no partial deal, both
sides have an interest in preventing violence from erupting.'' He
added that his polls show that despite the waxing and waning of
Arafat's popularity, the radical Islamic alternative represented by
Hamas and Islamic Jihad has not gained at all in popularity in
recent years. Total support for those groups has been flat at about
20 percent for five years, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, nobody knows how this balance would shift if there
were concessions on Jerusalem, which stands as the symbol of the
Islamic cause in the Holy Land. Many believe that it is not up to
Arafat but to the broader Arab leadership to make concessions on
Jerusalem and that is unlikely soon. As long as negotiations
continue, that question may not have to be faced in the short term.
</P>
<P>
   Shikaki noted that the next deadline is Sept. 13, when Arafat
has warned he will unilaterally announce the existence of a
Palestinian state if negotiations have not yet produced it. But
Shikaki acknowledged that that deadline could also be stretched.
</P>
<P>
   And even if the state is declared, the impact is not clear.
Arafat declared the state's existence once already _ in 1988 _ to
little effect. It is true that Palestinians today have a large,
lightly armed force inside the West Bank and Gaza Strip, so the
declaration could have more bite and could, in fact, lead to
violent confrontation. Then again, the intifada of a decade ago is
not reproducible now since the soldiers among the Palestinians
today are Palestinian, not Israeli. A street revolt, unless
actually led by Arafat, would probably have to start as one against
him, and for now that prospect seems remote. Rogue acts of violence
could, of course, lead to sympathetic involvement of Palestinian
police. But, again, the prevalent view is that such violence would
be quelled.
</P>
<P>
   Others argue that, given the difficult issues, like Jerusalem
and refugees, that were on the table, Camp David's failure was not
only inevitable but useful. Zev Chafets, a commentator who was head
of the Israeli government press office under Prime Minister
Menachem Begin 20 years ago, even suggests that the general
reaction in the Middle East is relief.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you come down to it, the deal was supposed to be our
giving them all this land in exchange for them saying they forgive
us,'' Chafets said. ``But they don't forgive us. We haven't reached
that stage yet. So we have to continue as is. We have reached quite
a comfortable modus vivendi. The Palestinians still run the Muslim
quarter and we still have sovereignty over Maale Adumim.'' He was
referring to a large Jewish settlement east of Jerusalem in the
West Bank.
</P>
<P>
   Uri Dromi, who ran the government press office under Yitzhak
Rabin, compares the relationship between Israelis and Palestinians
to that between a couple going through a divorce while living in
the same house. ``Neither one is going to leave, even if they try
to make life unbearable for each other. So, in the long run, they
adjust and minimize the points of friction.''
</P>
<P>
   But Dromi points to the increasing interaction between people on
the two sides as evidence that the process of mutual adjustment is
advancing. He says that his brother, a senior police officer, is in
frequent contact with Palestinian officers and that even when
official relations have been tense, personal ones have been warm.
He notes further that every Saturday there are huge traffic jams as
thousands of Israelis drive to the West Bank cities of Nablus and
Tulkarm to shop. Thousands of others drive to Jericho to gamble.
``These are the same cities where their sons had to chase stone
throwers into the alleys of the casbah,'' he mused.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &UR; BC-MIDEAST-SUMMIT-REVIEW-2NDTAKE-NYT &LR;  &QL; 
 &UR; UNDATED: he mused. &LR;  &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The reality is indeed new. For two generations, the political
divide in Israel was between those on the left who called for ``two
states for two peoples'' and those on the right who swore there
would never be a Palestinian state. Now the whole discussion is
what the contours and powers of that state would be.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is a major realignment going on,'' said Yoram Hazony, a
conservative who was an aide to Benjamin Netanyahu when he was
prime minister. ``There is, in effect, a condition of political
independence for the Palestinians. Today, there is no such thing as
a `not-one-inch' position. Now you hear people on the far right
saying that if we are going to trade territory, let's give the
Palestinians as many Arab villages in Israel as possible to
maximize the Jewish majority in Israel.''
</P>
<P>
   In fact, there is another useful myth that animated the Camp
David peace process: that only the governments of Barak and Arafat
in their current configurations can make this peace and so a
historic opportunity is at stake. The same was said of Yitzhak
Rabin and Arafat. After Rabin's assassination in 1995 by a Jewish
extremist, the hawkish Netanyahu was elected and the doomsayers
seemed correct. But the peace process did not die, and it is
unlikely to if Barak and Arafat fail to decide how to share
Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
   All acknowledge that Jerusalem is the most difficult issue
because while land can be divided, it is far less clear how to
divide a symbol that is, in Hazony's words, ``at the heart of what
we think we are doing.''
</P>
<P>
   But it is also a myth that only at Camp David did the issue of
Jerusalem first get an airing. It was certainly the first time it
was broached directly at the very top, but Jerusalem has been under
discussion for quite a while. Yossi Beilin, a senior minister in
Barak's government, negotiated Jerusalem's future with Abu Mazen, a
senior Palestinian official, in 1995. The Rabin assassination in
November of that year ended those discussions.
</P>
<P>
   There are many reasons for pessimism over the Israeli-Arab
conflict. There is a huge disparity in culture and income and
numerous bases of resentment. Meron Benvenisti, a leftist former
deputy mayor of Jerusalem and an Israeli expert on the West Bank,
is dismissive of the negotiations over Jerusalem neighborhoods and
sovereignty sharing because he believes the Israelis still do not
take the Palestinians seriously as human beings. That failure, he
believes, will bring the process to a very unhappy end.
</P>
<P>
   ``We sit back and feel self-righteous and convert the whole
question into whether there will be violence,'' he said. ``The
Arabs are interesting to us only as a threat.''
</P>
<P>
   But for many others, the peace process is best seen like the
stock market. It may have its frightening ups and downs, but its
positive direction in the long term is clear. The key is to avoid
irrational exuberance or utter gloom.
</P>
<P>
   Salameh Nematt, a Jordanian journalist for the Arab newspaper Al
Hayat, says he marvels at how much has happened in a decade. ``In
the beginning, they spoke of Gaza first,'' he recalled of Israeli
proposals in the early 1990s. ``Then it was Gaza and Jericho first
and Gaza and Jericho last. Then came Nablus and Tulkarm and then 9
percent of the land and then 13 percent and then talk of maybe 50
percent and now we are hearing about more than 90 percent. Any
Israeli government that moves too fast will be burned but so will
any government that moves too slowly. The final settlement may take
another 10 or 15 years, but it will come. Remember how Israelis who
met with Arafat used to go to jail? Now he's their best friend.'' &QL;

A CONVENTION FOR EVERYONE, ONE AT A TIME 
</HEADLINE>
   (The Week in Review)  
 By PETER MARKS   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   At this summer's political party gatherings, where the outcomes
are preordained, the hottest activity may be interactivity. For the
Republican National Convention this week, for example, Chris Long
wants to put you in the director's seat. On C-SPAN's Web site, run
by Long, users will be able to click on one of several distinct
video feeds from the convention hall, or even choose to watch the
action from the vantage point of the C-SPAN control booth.
</P>
<P>
   C-SPAN is one of several operations using similar technology at
the conventions. In each case, their U-pick-em-style camera angles
takes the editor out of the equation and put the accent in media on
the ``me.''
</P>
<P>
   ``They allow users to have different experiences of the same
event,'' Long said.
</P>
<P>
   In other words, the nation's armchair politicos can now begin to
create their own show.
</P>
<P>
   Customized political conventions are just one example of the
nation's growing, technologically abetted obsession with getting
what you want when you want. From sites that download music onto
personalized players, to digital television services that rearrange
prime-time offerings to fit viewers' schedules, electronic wizardry
is constantly expanding the possibilities for satisfying consumer
demand for individualization.
</P>
<P>
   It's one thing, though, to go online to order a pair of jeans
tailored to specifications for ankle width and button color, and
quite another to design one's own idea of a political convention.
The quadrennial events, with their idiosyncratic procedures and
highly scripted programs, are at heart communal exercises for both
the participants and the audience. So what happens to the shared
national experience when no two members of the audience share the
same convention, or, by logical extension, the same election-day
coverage?
</P>
<P>
   Some media observers, like Russell Newman, a researcher on
Internet issues at the Annenberg Public Policy Center at the
University of Pennsylvania, are not convinced customized camera
angles are anything but Webfoolery.
</P>
<P>
   ``My estimate of the audience for a bird's eye view of the top
of the convention dome,'' Newman said, ``is seven people.''
</P>
<P>
   But if this initial stab at a Web-enabled convention doesn't
work, that will hardly spell its death. In fact, the Internet, a
technology that is inherently individualistic and interactive, is
rapidly growing in prominence in the political process. Candidate
Web sites are getting better, Internet fund-raising and voter
communications are growing more sophisticated and effective, and
many people think the advent of voting via the Web is only a matter
of time.
</P>
<P>
   The water cooler has long played a significant role in the
nation's political conversation. Indeed, part of the enjoyment of
watching conventions is the post-mortem critiquing of the
politicians and the anchors and the conventioneers in the silly
hats. But who is going to shoot the breeze with friends if one
spent the night before in a chat room, exploring tobacco policy
with lobbyists from Kentucky, another was transfixed by a camera
trained on the Hawaii delegation, a third was consumed with
e-mailing questions to a Webcast on MSNBC _ and none paid attention
to a word of the vice presidential nominee's address?
</P>
<P>
   With more options, your water-cooler conversations are going to
be many times smaller,'' said Sam Hollander, executive producer of
Pseudopolitics.com, a Web site that will, among other things,
provide a 360-degree view through a series of cameras inside the
First Union Center in Philadelphia and the Staples Center in Los
Angeles, where the Democrats convene in August. ``There will be a
lot of two-person conversations, rather than 20-person
conversations.''
</P>
<P>
   This relentless subdividing of common ground, Hollander said, is
akin to the fragmenting of television viewership, thanks to the
multiplicity of choices on cable.
</P>
<P>
   ``All you need to do is look at what ratings share a network has
to get today to have a success,'' he said. ``There was a time when
if you didn't get a 30 share, it wasn't that big. Now, if you get a
20, you're a huge hit.''
</P>
<P>
   Where once the country was knit together by the collective
experience of watching the same sitcom on one of the networks, or
having the meaning of a national tragedy interpreted by Walter
Cronkite, the I-can-do-it-myself ethos engendered by technology is
on the verge of assuring that there will be no collective
electronic experience.
</P>
<P>
   TiVo, for example, is a year-old digital service based in
California that allows subscribers to program their televisions to
play only what they want to see at a time of their choosing. Its
recent television commercial depicting network programmers being
tossed out of windows asked , ``When you've got TiVo, who needs
them?'' Some networks refused to run it, say TiVo executives.
</P>
<P>
   No one as yet is confidently predicting just how all this
electronic democracy will affect the democratic process. Paul
Sagan, president of Akamai Technologies, an Internet company
selected by the Democrats to deliver all of their streaming media
convention coverage, says the interactive age is probably too new
in this election cycle to profoundly affect voters' view of events.
</P>
<P>

A CONVENTION FOR EVERYONE, ONE AT A TIME 
</HEADLINE>
   (The Week in Review)  
 By PETER MARKS   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   At this summer's political party gatherings, where the outcomes
are preordained, the hottest activity may be interactivity. For the
Republican National Convention this week, for example, Chris Long
wants to put you in the director's seat. On C-SPAN's Web site, run
by Long, users will be able to click on one of several distinct
video feeds from the convention hall, or even choose to watch the
action from the vantage point of the C-SPAN control booth.
</P>
<P>
   C-SPAN is one of several operations using similar technology at
the conventions. In each case, their U-pick-em-style camera angles
takes the editor out of the equation and put the accent in media on
the ``me.''
</P>
<P>
   ``They allow users to have different experiences of the same
event,'' Long said.
</P>
<P>
   In other words, the nation's armchair politicos can now begin to
create their own show.
</P>
<P>
   Customized political conventions are just one example of the
nation's growing, technologically abetted obsession with getting
what you want when you want. From sites that download music onto
personalized players, to digital television services that rearrange
prime-time offerings to fit viewers' schedules, electronic wizardry
is constantly expanding the possibilities for satisfying consumer
demand for individualization.
</P>
<P>
   It's one thing, though, to go online to order a pair of jeans
tailored to specifications for ankle width and button color, and
quite another to design one's own idea of a political convention.
The quadrennial events, with their idiosyncratic procedures and
highly scripted programs, are at heart communal exercises for both
the participants and the audience. So what happens to the shared
national experience when no two members of the audience share the
same convention, or, by logical extension, the same election-day
coverage?
</P>
<P>
   Some media observers, like Russell Newman, a researcher on
Internet issues at the Annenberg Public Policy Center at the
University of Pennsylvania, are not convinced customized camera
angles are anything but Webfoolery.
</P>
<P>
   ``My estimate of the audience for a bird's eye view of the top
of the convention dome,'' Newman said, ``is seven people.''
</P>
<P>
   But if this initial stab at a Web-enabled convention doesn't
work, that will hardly spell its death. In fact, the Internet, a
technology that is inherently individualistic and interactive, is
rapidly growing in prominence in the political process. Candidate
Web sites are getting better, Internet fund-raising and voter
communications are growing more sophisticated and effective, and
many people think the advent of voting via the Web is only a matter
of time.
</P>
<P>
   The water cooler has long played a significant role in the
nation's political conversation. Indeed, part of the enjoyment of
watching conventions is the post-mortem critiquing of the
politicians and the anchors and the conventioneers in the silly
hats. But who is going to shoot the breeze with friends if one
spent the night before in a chat room, exploring tobacco policy
with lobbyists from Kentucky, another was transfixed by a camera
trained on the Hawaii delegation, a third was consumed with
e-mailing questions to a Webcast on MSNBC _ and none paid attention
to a word of the vice presidential nominee's address?
</P>
<P>
   With more options, your water-cooler conversations are going to
be many times smaller,'' said Sam Hollander, executive producer of
Pseudopolitics.com, a Web site that will, among other things,
provide a 360-degree view through a series of cameras inside the
First Union Center in Philadelphia and the Staples Center in Los
Angeles, where the Democrats convene in August. ``There will be a
lot of two-person conversations, rather than 20-person
conversations.''
</P>
<P>
   This relentless subdividing of common ground, Hollander said, is
akin to the fragmenting of television viewership, thanks to the
multiplicity of choices on cable.
</P>
<P>
   ``All you need to do is look at what ratings share a network has
to get today to have a success,'' he said. ``There was a time when
if you didn't get a 30 share, it wasn't that big. Now, if you get a
20, you're a huge hit.''
</P>
<P>
   Where once the country was knit together by the collective
experience of watching the same sitcom on one of the networks, or
having the meaning of a national tragedy interpreted by Walter
Cronkite, the I-can-do-it-myself ethos engendered by technology is
on the verge of assuring that there will be no collective
electronic experience.
</P>
<P>
   TiVo, for example, is a year-old digital service based in
California that allows subscribers to program their televisions to
play only what they want to see at a time of their choosing. Its
recent television commercial depicting network programmers being
tossed out of windows asked , ``When you've got TiVo, who needs
them?'' Some networks refused to run it, say TiVo executives.
</P>
<P>
   No one as yet is confidently predicting just how all this
electronic democracy will affect the democratic process. Paul
Sagan, president of Akamai Technologies, an Internet company
selected by the Democrats to deliver all of their streaming media
convention coverage, says the interactive age is probably too new
in this election cycle to profoundly affect voters' view of events.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the cat is out of the bag, and the savviest politicians,
Sagan said, will quickly begin to look for ways to satisfy the
demands for individualized attention from users of the Internet,
who now number more than 115 million in this country.
</P>
<P>
   ``In interactivity, people expect to control the query and get

A REPUBLICAN TRYOUT FOR CLINTON'S OLD SCRIPT 
</HEADLINE>
   (The Week in Review)  
 By RICHARD L. BERKE    
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHILADELPHIA _ There are three things you will have to look hard
for as you tune in to the Republican National Convention here this
week: A true-blue conservative icon on center stage. (There may be
a few, but they will be sprinkled in a line-up that resembles a
Benetton commercial.) Any utterance of the word ``abortion.''
(You're more likely to hear the words, ``poor'' or ``underclass.'')
The traditional savaging of the opposition. (Instead, look for
subtle denigrations of the Clinton-Gore years and bipartisan
overtures.)
</P>
<P>
   If the Republicans seem timid about bashing President Clinton
this year, it's only fitting. That's because they've stolen his
political game plan. In fact the Grand Old Party is attempting to
refashion itself entirely, clearly using Clinton as its model.
</P>
<P>
   Eight years after Clinton captured the White House by venturing
toward the middle and running against some of the orthodoxies of
his party _ including those on welfare, teacher unions and racial
quotas _ Texas Gov. George W. Bush is trying a similar approach.
While Bush is not moving as far as Clinton in forsaking the
principles of his party, he sounds a lot like a Democrat when he
holds forth about protecting Social Security, reaching out to the
dispossessed and lavishing more money on public education.
</P>
<P>
   Bush last week startled Democrats and Republicans alike when he
spoke out about prescription drug benefits for the elderly. Bush
has even appropriated Clinton's mantra from 1992, ``a different
kind of Democrat.'' He would be ``a different kind of Republican,''
he reassures audiences.
</P>
<P>
   This weekend, Republicans are advertising ``a different kind of
convention.'' This is what Americans will see on stage: A single
mom. A grandmother and granddaughter talking about Social Security.
A rank-and-file union member discussing his economic plight. A
teacher chatting about education reform.
</P>
<P>
   But to win the White House, Bush must prove that he is doing
more than muffling the vitriol by yanking the Pat Buchanans,
Marilyn Quayles and Phil Gramms offstage. His challenge is to
assemble a new Republican majority with the help of constituencies
that voted Democratic four years ago.
</P>
<P>
   To do that, he has to convince voters that he is not beholden to
the right wing. With some success, polls show, Bush is making a
play for the blue-collar Democrats and suburban women who backed
Clinton overwhelmingly four years ago. He is reaching out
aggressively to Latino voters. He even dared to speak before the
NAACP, not because he thought he could convert African American
voters _ among the Democratic Party's most loyal backers _- but
because of the signal it would send to moderates that he is
inclusive.
</P>
<P>
   Part of the calculation, too, is that such appeals could at the
very least give minorities less reason to mobilize against
Republicans on Election Day.
</P>
<P>
   Bush can afford to reach out to moderates this year because the
base of his own party, ravenous to reclaim the White House, is
willing to make compromises. Not since the love fest for Ronald
Reagan in 1984 have Republicans appeared so harmonious on the eve
of their convention.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you spend one day of this convention making Republicans
happy, you're wasting your time because they already are,'' said
Rick Davis, a top official at four past Republican conventions.
</P>
<P>
   As the campaign intensifies, though, Vice President Al Gore and
the Democrats will increasingly portray Bush as Newt Gingrich
without the scowl. To this end, they were handed some potent
ammunition last week, when Bush picked Dick Cheney as his running
mate.
</P>
<P>
   The Cheney pairing suggested that Bush was harkening to his
party's conservative past rather than seeking a partner who could
broaden the ticket's ideological appeal. Clinton, in contrast, won
credibility as a reconfigured Democrat by picking Gore _ assembling
a Southern moderate ticket.
</P>
<P>
   Bush did not have to settle on a conservative. He has the
latitude that was denied Bob Dole four years ago when he picked
Jack Kemp as his running mate. Dole, however, needed someone to
rouse the party's conservative faithful, who had not rallied around
him, as they have around Bush.
</P>
<P>
   Pat Robertson, the founder of the Christian Coalition, said he
was reassured by the Cheney pick. ``The fact that he's reaching out
to swing voters is not a bad thing,'' he said. ``You can trust the
candidate. You know where he's coming from philosophically. He's
not doing anything to alienate his base. That's the important
thing.''
</P>
<P>
   Will he be as successful at co-opting _ or at least taming _ the
opposition as Clinton? Or will he fail, as did Gov. Michael Dukakis
in 1988? In that year's campaign, the elder George Bush effectively
branded Dukakis a Massachusetts liberal and card-carrying member of
the American Civil Liberties Union.
</P>
<P>
   Thus far, Gov. Bush and the Republicans have had it both ways.
It happened this weekend in Philadelphia. The Bush-controlled
Republican Party drafted a platform that cast off several
hard-edged party positions of the past, like abolishing the
Education Department and the National Endowment for the Arts. The
hostile language toward immigration four years ago was substituted
with a tribute to the role of new Americans. But conservatives were
not neglected. The platform contained a reaffirmation of its ban on
abortion _ with no exceptions _ despite a drive on Friday by some
party members to soften the language.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &UR; BC-GOP-OUTLOOK-REVIEW-2NDTAKE-NYT &LR;  &QL; 
 &UR; PHILADELPHIA: the langauge. &LR;  &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   It happened in Austin last week. There Bush was, introducing to
the world a running mate who had one of the most conservative
voting records in Congress. But in their oratory, they sounded as
Democratic as Al Gore.
</P>
<P>
   Bush declared that he called upon Cheney to help him
``accomplish some great goals'' for the nation: ``To save and
strengthen Social Security. To improve Medicare and provide
prescription drugs for the elderly. To reform our public schools.''
All but the last point _ ``To rebuild our military to keep the
peace'' _ sounded like they would be more likely to issue from Al
Gore's mouth.
</P>
<P>
   The Democrats, of course, are already working hard not to let
Bush get away with this balancing act. They argue that many of his
proposals for new spending on social projects are modest and
symbolic. And most of these proposals, they note, offer
traditionally Republican solutions that rely heavily on the power
of the private sector, as in his plan to privatize Social Security
or his endorsement of vouchers to allow public money to go to
private schools.
</P>
<P>
   Voters may recognize that there are some real ideological
divides between Bush and Gore. A New York Times/CBS News Poll last
week showed that the public sees stark differences in how they
would handle taxes, health care, abortion and the environment.
</P>
<P>
   Still, Bush's right-down-the-middle tactics may succeed. Both
parties have a history of remaking themselves. In 1952, Dwight
Eisenhower refused to tear down elements of the New Deal and spoke
loftily about retooling the Republican Party. While Bush calls
himself a ``compassionate conservative,'' Eisenhower favored the
term ``dynamic conservatism.''
</P>
<P>
   William Bennett, the former education secretary, said the
convention strategy is too middle-of-the-road for his taste, but
defends it as smart politics. ``The convention is not as right-wing
as I am,'' he said. ``They're not taking advice from the old
Washington hands. They're following their own counsel _ and doing
it brilliantly.''
</P>
<P>
   Yet while prominent conservatives are staying silent as their
bread-and-butter issues _ school prayer and opposition to abortion
and homosexual rights _ get short shrift (or no shrift at all),
Bush could be risking his relations with others on the right, who
worry that the party is losing its soul.
</P>
<P>
   David A. Keene, chairman of the American Conservative Union,
warned that Bush had better be careful that his overtures to
moderates do not become more substantive. ``The feel-good stuff and
atmospherics is all fine,'' he said. ``But when push comes to
shove, Republicans win elections in which there is a clear
distinction between their position and the Democratic position on
the issues. If you spend all your time reaching out, you're putting
your base in danger.''
</P>
<P>
   For now, Bush seems to be having more luck reassuring
conservatives than his father, the former president, who was never
fully trusted on the right.
</P>
<P>
   Robertson, for one, is haunted by the elder Bush's speech,
written by Peggy Noonan, at the 1988 Republican convention at which
the nominee uttered his famous anti-tax pledge. ``I just hope and
pray he doesn't have Peggy Noonan write, `Read My Lips,'''
Robertson said. ``We don't need any tax pledge redux!''
</P>
<P>
   So the right is watching. But if the younger Bush has learned
anything from his father, it is that if you try to tack right and
then dance to the center, you can end up falling off the political
stage.

   A Creeping Tale for $1 a Chapter
</P>
<P>
   The horror writer Stephen King became the first major author to
self-publish over the Internet when he released the first chapter
of a serial novel called ``The Plant,'' about a vine that
terrorizes a publishing house.
</P>
<P>
   King's previous electronic book, the novella ``Riding the
Bullet,'' drew 400,000 orders in the first 24 hours after Simon &AMP;
Schuster published it in March. This time King is cutting out his
publisher, hoping to break new ground for less commercially
successful authors. Using a honor system, he is asking $1 for the
first chapter and for each monthly installment. He will stop
writing unless 75 percent of the downloaders pay, leaving fans in
suspense.
</P>
<P>
   So far 41,000 copies of chapter one were downloaded the first
day it appeared. That is far less than the initial demand for his
novella, which had Simon &AMP; Schuster's advance marketing behind it.
But it is still more than most titles sell in a year. King will
post another tally this weekend. So far more than 75 percent of the
readers are paying; Amazon.com is collecting. An envelope
mistakenly arriving at King's office was addressed only: ``Stephen
King, Rich Writer, Bangor, Maine.'' Inside was a check for $5. The
return address: ``Satisfied Downloader.''

   Economies of Scale at Ford
</P>
<P>
   Since the early 1980s, automakers have made small fuel-economy
gains on some models only to make other vehicles larger and more
powerful, with poorer mileage. The result has been ever-increasing
emissions of global warming gases and more dependence on foreign
oil. Ford Motor changed course, vowing to increase the average
mileage of all its sport utility vehicles by 25 percent, to 23
miles a gallon from 18, by 2005. Ford will also improve the fuel
economy of its other models.

   In Britain, mad cow disease is scarier than ever. Fourteen

toll might presage an even higher death rate.
</P>
<P>
   So the U.S. Department of Agriculture is acting zealously to
combat any chance of mad cow disease entering the country. It has

sheep related to the 355 animals tested positive for an

federal court, the owners of the sheep have challenged the science

stop wild speculation in books, and later on Web sites, About the
manuscript's contents, ranging from predictions of the Apocalypse

</P>
<P>
   Q: Did the late Sen. Paul Coverdell vote to impeach President
Clinton?
</P>
<P>
   A: After the House voted to impeach Clinton, Coverdell, a
Georgia Republican, voted to convict him on both impeachment
articles.
</P>
<P>
   As reported in the Atlanta Journal-Constitution Feb. 13, 1999,
Coverdell said the votes were ``horrible.'' He said he wrestled
with his decision right up until the day of the votes, even though
he had a ``gut feeling'' for several days about which way he would
go. When he spoke in closed session, he told colleagues that he
wanted to listen to the very last word of their arguments before he
rendered his own judgment.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is no adjective that I have been able to find that
adequately explains how you feel going through something like
this,'' Coverdell said at the time. ``It was a dreadful feeling . .
. and I don't believe I'm alone in this, to describe the anguish
that went through everybody.''
</P>
<P>
   Coverdell had urged his colleages to conduct a trial that would
be as short as possible and still constitutionally fair. He was
known to refuse media requests to talk about the charges against
Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   Q: I often see ``obo'' in classified ads following the price of
an item. What do these letters stand for?
</P>
<P>
   A: Or best offer.
</P>
<P>
   Q: I understand that Martha Stewart was married at one time. Do
you know anything about her husband?
</P>
<P>
   A: There's not much to report other than the fact that the
hearth goddess of the American home was divorced from book
publisher Andrew Stewart in 1989 or 1990 (reports differ). They
were married in 1961, when she was in her second year at Barnard
College, and had one child, Alexis.
</P>
<P>
   A 1991 article in the Detroit News reported that the divorce was
``a messy affair,'' adding that she cut off all questions about him
in an interview. An article this year in the Times of London went a
bit further, reporting that the divorce was ``so acrimonious that
Mr. Stewart reportedly sought a court order to stop his wife (from)
talking to him.'' The Times article said he subsequently married
one of his wife's former flower arrangers and had three more
children.
</P>
<P>
   A book, ``Just Desserts,'' by Jerry Oppenheimer, makes a number
of allegations about the Stewarts' relationship and divorce. Other
than that, Andrew Stewart has not been in the public eye, nor have
his recent activities been publicized.
</P>
<P>
   Q: The recent Concorde crash near Paris seemed remarklably
similar to one in Paris in the 1960s in which a number of prominent
Atlanta people lost their lives. Was a cause ever determined for
the earlier crash?
</P>
<P>
   A: Almost immediately after the crash of the chartered Air
France Boeing 707 on June 3, 1962, the airline released a history
of the aircraft stating that its weight during takeoff, the
prevailing wind conditions, and the length of runway available, all
were ``well within the limits.'' Accounts published later said
trouble developed as soon as the aircraft was beginning to roll for
takeoff at Orly Airport, and the pilot attempted to abort takeoff
by reversing the engines and locking the wheels.
</P>
<P>
   In 1969, litigation finally was ended in what the book ``Atlanta
and Environs'' termed a hush-hush settlement. Before the case was
settled _ according to an account in the book's Volume III, written
by Harold Martin _ the chief attorneys for the plaintiffs had
alleged that there was ``willful misconduct on the part of the
airline because the Boeing 707's stabilizer was not set correctly
for takeoff and the pilot attempted to stop the plane after it had
passed the point on the runway where no attempt should be made to
stop it.''
</P>
<P>
   Of the 129 people who died in the crash, 114 were from Georgia.
Reports said the airline paid $5.2 million to the survivors of 62
people killed. Survivors of other crash victims settled with the
airline without litigation for undisclosed sums.
</P>
<P>
   Q: I know basically what a baseball relief pitcher's ``save''
is, but can you explain the exact rules?
</P>
<P>
   A: A relief pitcher is credited with a save when he's the
finishing pitcher in a game won by his team; he's not the winning
pitcher; and he qualifies under one of these conditions: he enters
the game with a lead of no more than three runs and pitches for at
least one inning; or he enters the game with the potential tying
run on base, at bat, or on deck; or he pitches effectively for at
least three innings.
</P>
<P>
   Q: What is the National Council of Churches? Which denominations
make up its membership?
</P>
<P>
   A: The National Council of Churches _ full name, National
Council of the Churches of Christ in the USA _ describes itself as
``the nation's leading organization in the movement for Christian
unity.'' Formed in 1950, it's an agency of 35 Protestant, Orthodox
and Anglican denominations. Not a governing body, the council says
it ``promotes interchurch cooperation.''
</P>
<P>
   The members: African Methodist Episcopal Church; African
Methodist Episcopal Zion Church; American Baptist Churches in the
USA; the Antiochian Orthodox Christian Archdiocese of North
America; Diocense of the Armenian Church of America; Christian
Church (Disciples of Christ); Christian Methodist Episcopal Church;
Church of the Brethren; the Coptic Orthodox Church in North
America;
</P>
<P>
   The Episcopal Church; Evangelical Lutheran Church in America;
Friends United Meeting; Greek Orthodox Archdiocese of North and
South America; Hungarian Reformed Church in America; International
Council of Community Churches; Korean Presbyterian Church in
America; Malankara Orthodox Syrian Church; Moravian Church in
American Northern Province and Southern Province; Mar Thoma Church;
</P>
<P>
   National Baptist Convention of America; National Baptist
Convention, U.S.A.; National Missionary Baptist Convention of
America; Orthodox Church in America; Patriachal Parishes of the
Russian Orthodox Church in the USA; Philadelphia Yearly Meeting of
the Religious Society of Friends; Polish National Catholic Church
of America; Presbyterian Church (U.S.A.); Progressive National
Baptist Convention;
</P>
<P>
   Reformed Church in America; Serbian Orthodox Church in the
U.S.A. and Canada; the Swedenborgian Church; Syrian Orthodox Church
of Antioch; Ukrainian Orthodox Church of America; United Church of
Christ; the United Methodist Church.
</P>
<P>
   Q: I keep hearing the word ``gravitas'' over and over on talk
shows. It is used concerning a political candidate. What does it
mean?
</P>
<P>
   A: Gravitas is a Latin word used to refer to a person's
character as conveying seriousness, dignity or authority, according
to Cassell's Latin Dictionary. It's the root word of ``gravity.''
The Compact Oxford English Dictionary, New Edition shows the Latin
word has been used by English speakers as meaning seriousness or
sobriety of conduct, bearing, speech or temperament; weighty
dignity; reverend seriousness or serious or solemn conduct.
</P>
<P>
   Q: I always thought that Australia had seasons opposite to ours,
so does that mean that the Summer Olympics are actually being held
in their winter?
</P>
<P>
   A: The seasons in Australia are approximately six months
different than ours, says Dean Hutsell, a meteorologist for the
National Weather Service.
</P>
<P>
   The 2000 Sydney Summer Games are being held from Sept. 15
through Oct. 1. So that would be early spring in Australia while
it's the beginning of autumn in the United States.

 &HT;    Q &AMP; A ON THE NEWS
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Q: Who does the government provide with security? Does the
Secret Service also protect members of the Supreme Court and
Congress?
</P>
<P>
   A: The Secret Service, an agency of the Treasury Department,
provides protection for the president, vice president, and their
families. They also protect presidential candidates, vice
presidential candidates, and their wives and children.
</P>
<P>
   The president can assign the Secret Service to anyone he feels
is in need of protection, according to James Cool, spokesman for
the Secret Service's Atlanta field office.
</P>
<P>
   The Supreme Court Police protects the Supreme Court justices and
the U.S. Capitol Police protects members of the House and Senate.
</P>
<P>
   Q: When are the presidential candidates eligible for Secret
Service protection, and are their running mates, wives, children
and family also protected?
</P>
<P>
   A: When protection begins for a presidential candidate varies
with each candidate. The Secret Service said George W. Bush started
receiving protection in February.
</P>
<P>
   James Cool, the agency's spokesman in Atlanta, explained that
the secretary of the treasury, advised by the speaker of House, the
House minority leader, the Senate majority and minority leaders and
one additional member of Congress chosen by the first four, decide
when a candidate has sufficient support from the public and his
party to qualify for Secret Service protection.
</P>
<P>
   Agents currently are protecting Bush, his wife, Laura, and
recently named Republican vice presidential candidate Dick Cheney
and his wife, Lynne. Vice President Al Gore, his wife and children
continue to be protected as they have been throughout Gore's terms
as vice president.
</P>
<P>
   Q: I read about protection pertaining to the president and vice
president, Supreme Court justices, members of Congress, and
presidential and vice presidential candidates, but what does the
Federal Protective Service do?
</P>
<P>
   A: The Federal Protective Service is part of the federal General
Services Administration, which is primarily responsibility for
administering and maintaining government buildings and vehicle
fleets. GSA spokeswoman Mildred Quinley said the agency also is
responsibile for protecting the buildings, the tenant in them, and
the surrounding property. The FPS also provides workshops on safety
for the tenants, and does outreach to residents of the surrounding
communities.
</P>
<P>
   Q: How many passengers does the Concorde carry?
</P>
<P>
   A: The supersonic Concorde generally carries 100 passengers. The
aircraft, however, was designed to carry a maximum of 144
passengers.
</P>
<P>
   Q: If George W. Bush is elected president, will this be the
first time that a father and son have been president?
</P>
<P>
   A: No. John Quincy Adams served as president of the United
States from 1825 until 1829. His father, John Adams, was president
from 1797 until 1801.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Didn't Bobby Jones, the great golfer during the 1920s and
'30s, win the Grand Slam also when he was about the same age as
Tiger Woods?
</P>
<P>
   A: When he was 28, Robert T. ``Bobby'' Jones won the Grand Slam,
that is, all four major championships of his time, in one year. No
one else has ever done that. Tiger Woods, 24, won the British Open
on July 23 and became the youngest man to have won all four majors
in his career.
</P>
<P>
   The four majors in 1930, the year Jones won the slam, were the
British Amateur, British Open, U.S. Open and U.S. Amateur.
</P>
<P>
   Today, the Grand Slam events are the Masters, U.S. Open, British
Open and PGA Championship, and no longer include the amateur
championships. Woods won the U.S. and British Opens this year, the
PGA Championship last year, and the Masters in 1997. He also won
three consecutive U.S. Amateurs (1994-96).
</P>
<P>
   The next youngest golfer to win the career Grand Slam was Jack
Nicklaus, at age 26.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Is it true that golfer Bobby Jones never turned pro and was
always an amateur?
</P>
<P>
   A: Bobby Jones was an amateur golfer when, at age 28, he became
the first man to achieve the Grand Slam in golf. From 1923 through
1930, he won 13 championships in those four major annual
tournaments of the era: the British Amateur, British Open, U.S.
Open and U.S. Amateur.
</P>
<P>
   Jones never became a professional golfer, and rarely played in
tournaments after 1930. An attorney, he went on to practice law in
Atlanta. He died in 1971.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Professional golfers have traditionally used gold tees in
tournaments. What kind of tees do the women and senior players use?
</P>
<P>
   A: The Professional Golfers Association and the Ladies
Professional Golf Association say they do not have a standard tee
used during any
</P>
<P>
   of the tours. The golf courses and the rules officials for each
tournament select the type of tees used during individual
competitions.
</P>
<P>
   ``On tour, it's going to vary because of sponsors, so (you) can
go to four different tours and see four different colors,'' said
Kathy Lawrence, spokeswoman for the LPGA.
</P>
<P>
   Q: I've been reading about problems with the overuse of
antibacterial products. Will regular soap and water remove the
harmful germs from your hands if you've been handling raw meat or
fish?
</P>
<P>
   A: Soap and water will do the trick, according to Judy Harrison
of the University of Georgia College of Family and Consumer
Sciences.
</P>
<P>
   ``The best way to wash your hands to remove bacteria is to scrub
them for at least 20 seconds under warm running water, using soap
and rubbing your hands back and forth,'' Harrison said. The
friction loosens the bacterial cells and helps to rinse them
away.''
</P>
<P>
   Q: When a pilot breaks the sound barrier, does he hear the boom?
</P>
<P>
   A: Master Sgt. Larry Orluskie, a spokesman for the Air Force,
said pilots do not have any indication that they are breaking the
speed of sound other than the speed registered on the intruments in
the cockpit.
</P>
<P>
   ``You don't even have any sensation of how fast you're going,''
Orluskie said.
</P>
<P>
   Pilots do not hear booms, because the sound falls behind the
jet. A sonic boom forms because the fuselage breaks through the
pocket of air surrounding it when the aircraft reaches Mach speed
and breaks the sound barrier.
</P>
<P>
   Mach 1, the speed of sound, is about 750 mph at sea level and
approximately 660 mph at 30,000 feet above sea level.
</P>
<P>
   Q: A newspaper article reported that the Internal Revenue
Service owes money to people. Is there a Web site or some other way
to find out who is due a refund, and how to get it?
</P>
<P>
   A: Mark Green, a spokesman for the IRS, said there is not a Web
site for people to check whether they're due a refund. People with
questions, however, can call the IRS toll-free: 1-800-829-1040.
</P>
<P>
   An audit by the independent Treasury inspector general for tax
administration, David C. Williams, according to The Associated
Press, found that 29,820 of 436,00 tax payments should have been
refunded or credited to tax payers who filed returns late but
within the legal requirements of generally three years after the
initial due date -- usually April 15. The audit found that the
agency had not credited or refunded $25 million in income tax
overpayments.
</P>
<P>
   The audit was done on tax returns from taxpayers nationwide
whose records had been
</P>
<P>
   transferred as of March 1999 to the IRS Excess Collections
Account.
</P>
<P>
   ``Any reader who thinks money is due back can call that 800
number and we'll be happy to help them,'' Green said.

 candidate Dick Cheney and his wife,
Lynne. Vice President Al Gore, his wife and children continue to be
protected as they have been throughout Gore's terms as vice
president.
<TEXT>
<P>
   Q: I read about protection pertaining to the president and vice
president, Supreme Court justices, members of Congress, and
presidential and vice presidential candidates, but what does the
Federal Protective Service do?
</P>
<P>
   A: The Federal Protective Service is part of the federal General
Services Administration, which is primarily responsibility for
administering and maintaining government buildings and vehicle
fleets. GSA spokeswoman Mildred Quinley said the agency also is
responsibile for protecting the buildings, the tenant in them, and
the surrounding property. The FPS also provides workshops on safety
for the tenants, and does outreach to residents of the surrounding
communities.
</P>
<P>
   Q: How many passengers does the Concorde carry?
</P>
<P>
   A: The supersonic Concorde generally carries 100 passengers. The
aircraft, however, was designed to carry a maximum of 144
passengers.
</P>
<P>
   Q: If George W. Bush is elected president, will this be the
first time that a father and son have been president?
</P>
<P>
   A: No. John Quincy Adams served as president of the United
States from 1825 until 1829. His father, John Adams, was president
from 1797 until 1801.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Didn't Bobby Jones, the great golfer during the 1920s and
'30s, win the Grand Slam also when he was about the same age as
Tiger Woods?
</P>
<P>
   A: When he was 28, Robert T. ``Bobby'' Jones won the Grand Slam,
that is, all four major championships of his time, in one year. No
one else has ever done that. Tiger Woods, 24, won the British Open
on July 23 and became the youngest man to have won all four majors
in his career.
</P>
<P>
   The four majors in 1930, the year Jones won the slam, were the
British Amateur, British Open, U.S. Open and U.S. Amateur.
</P>
<P>
   Today, the Grand Slam events are the Masters, U.S. Open, British
Open and PGA Championship, and no longer include the amateur
championships. Woods won the U.S. and British Opens this year, the
PGA Championship last year, and the Masters in 1997. He also won
three consecutive U.S. Amateurs (1994-96).
</P>
<P>
   The next youngest golfer to win the career Grand Slam was Jack
Nicklaus, at age 26.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Is it true that golfer Bobby Jones never turned pro and was
always an amateur?
</P>
<P>
   A: Bobby Jones was an amateur golfer when, at age 28, he became
the first man to achieve the Grand Slam in golf. From 1923 through
1930, he won 13 championships in those four major annual
tournaments of the era: the British Amateur, British Open, U.S.
Open and U.S. Amateur.
</P>
<P>
   Jones never became a professional golfer, and rarely played in
tournaments after 1930. An attorney, he went on to practice law in
Atlanta. He died in 1971.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Professional golfers have traditionally used gold tees in
tournaments. What kind of tees do the women and senior players use?
</P>
<P>
   A: The Professional Golfers Association and the Ladies
Professional Golf Association say they do not have a standard tee
used during any
</P>
<P>
   of the tours. The golf courses and the rules officials for each
tournament select the type of tees used during individual
competitions.
</P>
<P>
   ``On tour, it's going to vary because of sponsors, so (you) can
go to four different tours and see four different colors,'' said
Kathy Lawrence, spokeswoman for the LPGA.
</P>
<P>
   Q: I've been reading about problems with the overuse of
antibacterial products. Will regular soap and water remove the
harmful germs from your hands if you've been handling raw meat or
fish?
</P>
<P>
   A: Soap and water will do the trick, according to Judy Harrison
of the University of Georgia College of Family and Consumer
Sciences.
</P>
<P>
   ``The best way to wash your hands to remove bacteria is to scrub
them for at least 20 seconds under warm running water, using soap
and rubbing your hands back and forth,'' Harrison said. The
friction loosens the bacterial cells and helps to rinse them
away.''
</P>
<P>
   Q: When a pilot breaks the sound barrier, does he hear the boom?
</P>
<P>
   A: Master Sgt. Larry Orluskie, a spokesman for the Air Force,
said pilots do not have any indication that they are breaking the
speed of sound other than the speed registered on the intruments in
the cockpit.
</P>
<P>
   ``You don't even have any sensation of how fast you're going,''
Orluskie said.
</P>
<P>
   Pilots do not hear booms, because the sound falls behind the
jet. A sonic boom forms because the fuselage breaks through the
pocket of air surrounding it when the aircraft reaches Mach speed
and breaks the sound barrier.
</P>
<P>
   Mach 1, the speed ofper article reported that the Internal
Revenue Service owes money to people. Is there a Web site or some
other way to find out who is due a refund, and how to get it?
</P>
<P>
   A: Mark Green, a spokesman for the IRS, said there is not a Web
site for people to check whether they're due a refund. People with
questions, however, can call the IRS toll-free: 1-800-829-1040.
</P>
<P>
   An audit by the independent Treasury inspector general for tax
administration, David C. Williams, according to The Associated
Press, found that 29,820 of 436,00 tax payments should have been
refunded or credited to tax payers who filed returns late but
within the legal requirements of generally three years after the
initial due date -- usually April 15. The audit found that the
agency had not credited or refunded $25 million in income tax
overpayments.
</P>
<P>
   The audit was done on tax returns from taxpayers nationwide
whose records had been
</P>
<P>
   transferred as of March 1999 to the IRS Excess Collections
Account.
</P>
<P>
   ``Any reader who thinks money is due back can call that 800
number and we'll be happy to help them,'' Green said.

 &HT;    An on-again, off-again love affair with orchids
 &HT;    By Lee May
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Orchids really have a hold on me. It's been a while
since I've been in an orchid period, about five or six years. Way
back in the 1990s, I bought several, and together we had a roaring
failure. I'd pick out stunningly beautiful plants, with blooms and
buds that looked like lovely winged creatures. Like many orchid
dabblers, I'd enjoy the blooms for months _ that's always been one
of the appeals _ and then I'd watch the plants just sit there for
the next year or so. I'd inspect my orchids, looking for the next
crop of wings. Nothing.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, my only success at getting one to bloom again (aside
from the jewel orchid, one that grows in dirt and is quite
different from those that have provided so many prom corsages) came
a few years ago when I stashed a worn-out plant in the back garden
and forgot about it. After several months of benign neglect, I
happened to look it up in its home, hidden near a rhododendron. The
poor plant not only had survived without me, but it had bloomed,
too. Alas, no more; that single burst of beauty was the orchid's
last gasp.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, a fading orchid entrusted to me by a friend met a
similar fate when I was unable to keep it going, no matter how much
I ignored it.
</P>
<P>
   Now I have returned to orchids with zeal, if not skill. So go
the rhythms of gardening. You embrace a plant, then you let it go,
returning to embrace it again, perhaps years later.
</P>
<P>
   I've always believed that plants are much like movies and books
and food and drink. A person's taste for such pleasures may change
with age and time and place in life; what you didn't like then you
can't get enough of now. And vice versa. You may fall in love with
a pleasure, then out, and in again. Sometimes, of course, love
burns hot and bright, only to burn out, never to be rekindled. It's
not necessarily so that the end of such a love negates its
existence.
</P>
<P>
   In her poem ``Passer Mortuus Est,'' Edna St. Vincent Millay
wasn't talking about orchids, but she could have been: ``After all,
my erstwhile dear, / My no longer cherished, / Need we say it was
not love, / Just because it perished?''
</P>
<P>
   My love for orchids perished, only to flourish again. It rose to
new heights about a month ago, when I could no longer garden
without these flowers growing, gracing, sometimes perfuming my
indoors, adding exotic color and style to any space they visited
outdoors.
</P>
<P>
   What's not to love? Orchids always have seduced and inspired
photographers and painters who can't resist the sprays of sexy
flowers that hang like butterflies on long stems. Television
producers, too, find them irresistible when they need a touch of
elegance on a simple set occupied by a talking face: A blooming
orchid in a simple container that does not compete with the flower
makes just the right visual statement.
</P>
<P>
   How delightful it is to be in love again. To be, again, under
the spell of phalaenopsis, dendrobium, cattleya, held tighter.
Tighter. This time around, I am determined that orchids and I will
make a go of it. I even put several in those special pots with the
holes around the bottom. What fun it'll be to see roots sprouting
through.
</P>
<P>
   And I feel so horticultural, now that I have them planted in
either fir bark or a special orchid mix containing everything from
coconut husk to lava rock. I'll study knowledgeable opinions on
care and feeding, use rain or distilled water.
</P>
<P>
   All the expert advice in the world won't guarantee new blooms
after these lovely ones have gone, of course. But I do take comfort
from a friend who explains why her orchids have done so well over
the years: ``I put them where they like to be, feed and water them
once in a while _ when I think about it. Otherwise, I just leave
them alone.''
</P>
<P>
   I can do that. A man in love can do anything.

 &HT;    Pomegranate: The politically exciting fruit
 &HT;    By John Kelso
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Anybody who says Dick Cheney is dull is nuts.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, Gov. George W. Bush's running mate is pretty darned
interesting. Cheney, after all, is allergic to pomegranates.
</P>
<P>
   Now, some of you folks may be thinking to yourself, ``I don't
know if I could vote for a man who is allergic to pomegranates.''
Not so fast. This is an unusual trait. I know a guy who can play
the ``Aggie War Hymn'' under his armpit. But I don't think I
personally know anybody who is allergic to pomegranates, an obscure
squishy red fruit with a lot of seeds.
</P>
<P>
   The former secretary of defense has had three minor heart
attacks and bypass surgery. No big news there. You could fill Texas
Stadium with guys who have had three minor big ones and a go-around
job. But what sets Cheney apart from the rest of the field is that
he also is allergic to pomegranates. That's pretty exciting.
</P>
<P>
   OK, so it's not that exciting. But by major political candidate
standards these days, this is pretty exciting. I have a hard time
imagining Bush, Cheney, Al Gore, and the inevitable stiff Gore is
going to pick later as his running mate doing the Bunny Hop. Thanks
to Bill Clinton, both parties are distancing themselves from, uh,
exciting.
</P>
<P>
   So by comparison, this makes pomegranates pretty darned fun.
</P>
<P>
   There are special times in your life when you should seize the
moment because something this big may never land in your lap again.
</P>
<P>
   Such a moment came last week for the Pomegranate Council in San
Francisco when it was revealed in the news that Cheney is allergic
to pomegranates.
</P>
<P>
   Don't you just know that news people all over the world,
including myself, raced to the phone to call the Pomegranate
Council to gather important pomegranate information? It could have
been a key day in the history of the Pomegranate Council, because
I'll bet most of their calls are wrong numbers, or from
telemarketers trying to sell them discount auto insurance.
</P>
<P>
   Sadly, however, when I called the Pomegranate Council, Tom
Tjerandsen, the executive director, was on vacation in Africa. Even
more tragically, Tjerandsen had forwarded his phone calls to Jay
Bell, a business associate who doesn't know jack about
pomegranates.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's news to me,'' Bell said, when I told him Cheney was
allergic to pomegranates. ``If you asked me a question about
raisins, I'd know all about it.''
</P>
<P>
   Hey, buddy. Find me a candidate who is allergic to raisins and
call me back.
</P>
<P>
   The Republican Party ought to run with this pomegranate thing
this week at its national convention. Being allergic to
pomegranates is perhaps the most unusual thing you can say about
any of the major candidates. Unless Gore has a corn we don't know
about.
</P>
<P>
   Another step the Republicans could take to make Dick Cheney more
appealing to younger voters is to come up with a colorful nickname
for him. How about Dick ``Guitar'' Cheney? Or Dick ``Night Train''
Cheney, Dick ``He's Got His Mojo Workin' '' Cheney or Dick
``Lightnin' '' Cheney?
</P>
<P>
   How's this for a bumper sticker: Dick Cheney _ Hold the
Pomegranates.

 &HT;    TV, nation tuning out candidates
 &HT;    By Mark Lane
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   DAYTONA BEACH, Fla. _ Forget what they say on the Sunday morning
news shows. The key to understanding this year's elections is The
Boredom Factor.
</P>
<P>
   This presidential election is going to see record levels of
voter absenteeism. Levels that go beyond apathy into something
resembling a voter boycott.
</P>
<P>
   This is a strange year. For the first time there was more
suspense in the Mexican presidential race than in the American.
</P>
<P>
   People running for Congress and state Cabinet and County Council
and Mosquito Control District will not be able to count on the
national race to scare up a few willing participants in democracy.
These candidates will need to get voters to the polls despite the
national race.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier this summer, 75 percent of Americans were paying little
or no attention to the national elections, according to polling by
the Shorenstein Center on the Press, Politic and Public Policy. Its
Vanishing Voter Project found 69 percent of the public think the
presidential campaign is boring. Those numbers will go up, party
spokesmen say. Just wait for the conventions!
</P>
<P>
   There was a time of yore when political conventions were
bubbling cauldrons of party intrigue. Where platform positions were
fought out with fists and table legs. Where factions contended,
demonstrators outside howled, delegates walked out and decisions
were made.
</P>
<P>
   But the modern political convention is a combination trade show,
focus group and infomercial. The delegates are a mere studio
audience with its eye on the applause sign. The speakers display
the product line with the wit and spontaneity of Academy Awards
presenters. No wonder the broadcast networks are planning not much
more than four hours of convention coverage.
</P>
<P>
   There are many reasons for this lack of interest. But let's be
clear: It is not because people are dumb, uninformed and don't give
a hoot about their country.
</P>
<P>
   One big reason is the lack of anything like a meaningful primary
process. One that road-tested themes and forced candidates to meet
real people. Money and party discipline nipped all that in the bud.
</P>
<P>
   But more important, people have rightly sensed that the things
candidates are saying have little connection with real life. Does
anyone really vote for a candidate baselues day on the campaign,
and Bush is famous for staying on-theme.
</P>
<P>
   And that's indicative of the kind of presidential campaign we've
got and conventions we're getting _ clean, on-theme and like a
machine.
</P>
<P>
   No wonder the nation is tuning out. Their time will be better
spent listening to their school board candidates. And the weather
outside is so nice.

FALL FASHION IS GLAMOROUS AND FEMININE

 By JANE RINZLER BUCKINGHAM  
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  FALL
<TEXT>
<P>
   I know there's still plenty of summer ahead of us, but it's not
too early to check out the hot fashions for fall. When it comes to
fashion, no one seems more interested (or influential) than today's
Gen Xers and Whyers. These are among their must-haves:
</P>
<P>
   COLORS
</P>
<P>
   When the economy is good, people tend to shy away from dour
colors and prefer a look in line with their upbeat attitude. True
to this spirit, fall will bring us many purples (it is the shade of
royalty, you know), plums and berry colors. But burnt orange and
olive will also abound. Some designers are also showing lots of
bright red.
</P>
<P>
   Brown, as they say, will be this year's black _ the
go-everywhere, do-anything color for fall _ but by spring we may
well see white, beige and black on the runways and in trendsetting
wardrobes.
</P>
<P>
   And, in fact, the most interesting innovation in color isn't a
color at all. It's the use of texture and sheen. From opalescent to
iridescent, fabrics are being designed to reflect light, flow as
you move and make you look like a mermaid out of water.
</P>
<P>
   ACCESSORIES
</P>
<P>
   This season, all eyes will be on the details. Forget the big
snakeskin skirts of spring and the hardly-there halter tops of
summer. Fall will produce a crop of classy ladies decked out in
strands of pearls. But if you can't see yourself in the preppy
look, go for the gold. From chain belts to big hoop earrings, the
hottest accessories will glitter.
</P>
<P>
   The biggest trend for fall may well be a freestanding fur
collar. However, as someone who is anti-fur, I'd forego the entries
from Prada and Michael Kors and instead find something faux but
equally fabulous.
</P>
<P>
   As for shoes, well, no one ever said that it was easy or
comfortable to be fashionable. This season's sellers will make you
wish for espadrilles. Stiletto boots will soar to new heights in
everything from snakeskin to supple leather. But if your feet just
can't stand the pinch, go for some semi-open-toed heels that look a
bit _ and I mean only a bit _ more practical.
</P>
<P>
   PATTERNS
</P>
<P>
   From herringbone to stripes, checks to plaid, fall fashion looks
like a cross between jackets from the Friars Club and your old
girl's school uniform. Oversized geometric prints and art deco
images abound. This year, the patterns are bigger and bolder than
in the past. You'll have to decide whether they're better.
</P>
<P>
   SUITS
</P>
<P>
   Look, it's not my fault, but the '80's are back with everything
from leg warmers to power suits. The good news? Women are embracing
suits because they want to, not because they feel they have to
dress like a man. Suits for the fall are very feminine and free and
a welcome relief from the snug skirts of spring.
</P>
<P>
   TRENCH COATS
</P>
<P>
   The great thing about this trend is you'll actually look forward
to rainy days. Today's trenches are made of funky material combined
with fashionable cuts. It is, as they say, the key outerwear
statement for the fall!
</P>
<P>
   BIASED TOWARD BLOUSES
</P>
<P>
   From satin blouses to slash-front blouses, sheer blouses to
cape-sleeved ones, blouses are more interesting than ever. Most of
them are feminine, relaxed and even fun. Gone are over-structured
and over-stiff shirts. This fall, look for free-flowing fabrics.
</P>
<P>
   GLAMORAMA
</P>
<P>
   When in doubt this fall, dress up rather than down. That doesn't
necessarily mean it's time to break out the tiaras _ although, on
second thought, sure, why not? But forget the sweat pants as well
as the hippie thing. Instead think lady-like glamour and elegance.
</P>
<P>
   DESIGNERS
</P>
<P>
   If you have money to burn, run to buy whatever you can from
Miguel Androver, Michael Kors, YSL and Christian Dior. But if your
budget is more limited, try Katayone Adeli, Theory, Rebecca
Dannenberg and William B, who follow fashion but at a more
reasonable price. I'm also a big fan of Club Monaco and Express,
both very affordable _ and if you're in New York City, be sure to
stop by the new H&AMP;M store at 51st St. and Fifth Ave. where the
lines are long but you can get hip outfits for such a low price you
can practically toss them out as soon as they go out of style.

 &HT;    Will Bush's use of Clintonian tactics come back to haunt him?
 &HT;    By Rowland Nethaway
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   When non-Texas Democrats learned that Gov. George W. Bush was a
likely Republican presidential candidate, they immediately
ridiculed Bush's message of ``compassionate conservatism.''
</P>
<P>
   These Democrats felt they owned compassion. They considered the
words ``Republican'' and ``compassion,'' or even ``conservative''
and ``compassion,'' as polar opposites _ notions that could not be
put together without violating the laws of nature.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the ridicule and charges of hypocrisy, Bush stuck with
his message through the primaries and on to the Republican
convention in Philadelphia where compassionate conservatism is
choreographed for all the world to see.
</P>
<P>
   The opening night of the Republican convention either proved
that the Democratic charges of hypocrisy are correct or that Bush
really is a new breed of Republican.
</P>
<P>
   Bush's wife, Laura, talked about her husband's values. She
talked about her husband's commitment to education where no child
would be left behind.
</P>
<P>
   Gen. Colin Powell, a man who probably could have become the
first African American president in 1992 or 1996 had he chosen to
run, was the keynote speaker.
</P>
<P>
   Gen. Powell and Mrs. Bush advanced the message that the
Republican Party needed and wanted women, minorities, independents
and Democrats.
</P>
<P>
   A lively African American gospel choir on stage followed a live
remote feed of a black preacher at a gospel church in South
Philadelphia.
</P>
<P>
   Powell received applause from the Republican conventioneers when
he talked about the need to support affirmative action.
</P>
<P>
   ``The party must follow Gov. Bush's lead and reach out to
minority communities, and particularly the African American
community, and not just during an election-year campaign,'' Powell
said.
</P>
<P>
   ``It must be a sustained effort,'' he continued. ``It must be
every day. It must be for real.'' The Republican convCould these be
the same Republicans who tried to scrap the Department of
Education, who heard former Republican presidential candidate Pat
Buchanan declare a cultural war, who proposed a constitutional
amendment to deny citizenship to children born in America if their
parents were ``not long-term residents,'' or who have opposed
affirmative action quotas and preferences for minorities and women?
</P>
<P>
   Democrats who say it's all an act may be speaking from
experience. They have given their unswerving support to Bill
Clinton and Al Gore, who invented New Democrats. Their invention,
introduced in the 1992 presidential campaign, called for filching
all the traditional Republican campaign issues to show that they
were realistic liberals.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton and Gore defined New Democrats as champions of welfare
reform, free trade, tougher crime laws, a stronger military, a
balanced budget and other traditional GOP positions.
</P>
<P>
   Bush likes to say that his presidency will be guided by
principles and not by public opinion polls. It's impossible to know
if that claim is accurate until Bush is elected and builds a track
record.
</P>
<P>
   The Clinton-Gore administration has a track record of flip flops
based on public opinion polls. The administration dropped support
of friends, appointees, programs and positions based on polling
numbers.
</P>
<P>
   By and large, Democrats have supported the Clinton-Gore shift to
``New Democrats'' by claiming it was smart politics to steal
traditional Republican issues and gain wider public support.
</P>
<P>
   The question is whether Bush is doing the same thing or if he
means what he says. It's informative that in Texas many old-line
and religious right Republicans consider Bush their enemy. History
will be the best judge of charges of hypocrisy.

<P>
   CVN-MONEY _ PHILADELPHIA _ All aboard! Rep. Tom Delay's party

<TEXT>
<P>
   An entire column devoted to vegetables is not going to appeal to
you if you are someone who prefers steak. Still this column is
dedicated to you because I think that if you will just give these
vegetables one chance, any of these recipes you will change your
mind, however grudgingly, about how good vegetables can taste.
</P>
<P>
   I admit I have chosen the time of year to tempt you when most
vegetables are at their peak: they are local; they are still fresh
and maybe they are even organic.
</P>
<P>
   Stop and think about it for a minute. Don't you just love corn?
That's a vegetable. And Baba Ghannouj, the side dish or dip that is
served at so many parties: it's main ingredient is eggplant. Even
if you are not an arugula fan, when you pair it with goat cheese
and mango, how could you possibly turn it down?
</P>
<P>
   To make these dishes even more appealing here are a few hints.
</P>
<P>
   The corn I added to the Baba Ghannouj _ certainly not a
traditional version of the dish _ gives texture and a bit of
sweetness to the eggplant. But remember many of the modern breeds
of corn, like the supersweets, barely call for cooking at all.
Forget the three minute rule and think, instead of the 30 second
rule. In fact I've eaten supersweets uncooked. Oh yes, don't salt
corn water before cooking: it makes the skin of the kernels tough.
</P>
<P>
   The mango in the arugula salad should be ripe but still very
firm so there is a lot of acid left in it. Its texture provides a
nice contrast to the crispness of the arugula and the softness of
the cheese.
</P>
<P>
   I created the zucchini and tomato recipe because I was given the
Japanese version of a mandoline, a French piece of equipment that
slices food thinner than possible by hand. But the Japanese version
of the mandoline is not only considerably cheaper than the French
it also works better. Many kitchen equipment stores carry the
Japanese slicer, but you can also try a Japanese market if you have
one nearby. I sliced everything on it for this dish: the onions,
squashes, tomatoes and cheese.
</P>
<P>
   Like the Baba Ghannouj, the zucchini-tomato dish can be prepared
a day ahead and refrigerated covered. Take the chill off the Baba
Ghannouj before serving, off the zucchini dish before cooking.
</P>
<P>
   BABA GHANNOUJ
</P>
<P>
   2 two-pound eggplant
</P>

<P>
   1. Turn broiler on. Cover broiler pans with aluminum foil. Wash
and dry eggplant; trim off ends and slice the rest of each eggplant
in 1/2 inch thick slices. Arrange slices on foil-covered pan (will
probably have to do this in two batches). Spray each slice with pan
spray and place on lowest shelf in broiler. Broil eggplant on one

</P>
<P>
   5. Turn eggplant, spray with pan spray and continue broiling
until the second side is browned and slices are soft, another few
minutes.
</P>
<P>
   6. When eggplant is soft, remove and cool until it can be
handled. Then remove the skin, place the flesh in the processor
bowl and puree.
</P>
<P>
   7. Stir the puree into the tahini mixture. Remove kernels from
corn and stir into the eggplant-tahini mixture. Season with salt
and pepper. Garnish with washed, dried cilantro or parsley sprigs.

 &HT;    AMERICAN ARCHITECT HELPS TO RESTORE RUSSIAN HERITAGE

<P>
   ARKANGELSKOE, Russia _ In these halls trimmed in gold leaf and
adorned with elaborate frescos, coat-tailed men and bejeweled women
waltzed all night in annual balls that were the talk of salons from
St. Petersburg to Paris.
</P>
<P>
   In the shadows of flickering candles, swirling feet and
sumptuous feasts that epitomized 18th-Century European grandeur
were up to 20,000 serfs. They, like African slaves in the old
American South, grew crops, tended horses, cooked and cleaned house
until the Bolshevik Revolution swept this lifestyle and their
owners into the dustbin of history.
</P>
<P>
   Today, the homes that sparked literary masterpieces and
political upheaval lay mostly forgotten, in heaps of crumbling
plaster and overgrown weeds _ a neglect that a dedicated group of
Russians and Americans, including Atlanta architect Rodney M. Cook
Jr., hope to remedy.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a shame to let history be forgotten. These beautiful
buildings were of unique designs and home to untold treasures. We
in America and the rest of the world don't know what's here,'' Cook
told Cox Newspapers. ``We should.''
</P>
<P>
   Cook recently completed a two-week tour of Russia along with the
American Friends of Russian Estate Homes, a fund started in 1997 by
Priscilla Roosevelt, a great-niece of former U.S. President
Franklin D. Roosevelt. Its goal is to help restore Russian manors
as national museums.
</P>
<P>
   With the aid of seed money attracted through the Washington
D.C.-based fund, they hope to rebuild the stately homes and turn
these national monuments into money-making enterprises supported by
a tourist infrastructure that includes hotels, restaurants and
roads _ all in short supply in post-Soviet Russia.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a project to revive local pride, local history and local
economies. It shouldn't take a dedicated traveler to tackle the
Russian countryside and uncover these homes,'' Cook said.
</P>
<P>
   Cook, the designer of Atlanta's World Athletes Monument, is a
lifelong devotee of Russian culture, especially its architecture.
His fascination with Russian manors started as a boy, when he
remembers searching in vain for details about rare photographs of
old palaces and buildings in St. Petersburg and other Russian
cities.
</P>
<P>
   ``I remember the ache I would feel as a kid trying to find out
about these things. But it was the 'Evil Empire.' Everything
Russian was off-limits,'' he recalled. ``It was back then that I
caught what Priscilla and I call the 'Russian disease.'''
</P>
<P>
   Now, Cook boasts the second-largest private library of Russian
architecture books in the United States. He has even embellished
his Buckhead home with Russian flourishes, including onion domes
and an Orthodox cross on the roof.
</P>
<P>
   His own infatuation aside, Cook says there is plenty to draw
tourists to Russian estate homes; from the elegant, exotic
furnishings to the similarities with the old Southern plantation
homes that can still be found in places like South Carolina's low
country and Natchez, Miss.
</P>
<P>
   Arkangelskoe, a 10-acre sprawling estate some 15 miles from
Moscow's Kremlin and one of three estates that Roosevelt's
non-profit group is working with, is reminiscent of famous U.S.
landmarks. The main building, the living quarters for the former
owner, Prince Nikolai Usupov, is lined with columns like Thomas
Jefferson's Monticello and topped with a dome like the Capitol
rotunda in Washington.
</P>
<P>
   ``The rules of building (both plantation homes and Russian
estates) were the same. The only thing that differed was the
climate,'' Cook said.
</P>
<P>
   The bitter Russian climate and neglect of the properties during
70 years of Soviet rule are the two biggest reasons why the
mansions are in disrepair.
</P>
<P>
   At Arkangelskoe, Usupov had built a magnificent 200-seat
theater, where for nearly a century guests of his family would
enjoy art and music while perched in blue, velvet seats in a
wood-paneled hall. Now, the theater's roof is collapsing,
endangering a priceless art collection.
</P>
<P>
   With Cook's help, the theater has been named by the World
Monument Fund as one of the world's 100 most endangered sights.
This listing brought the directors of the Arkangelskoe (pronounced,
``ark-an-gul-skoy-ya'') museum their first foreign grants totaling
nearly $1 million to rebuild the theater. Now, Arkangelskoe is
looking for funds for the other 13 buildings on the grounds.
</P>
<P>
   Yuri Lomakin, Arkangelskoe's vice director, says he has an
accurate idea of how the estate looked in its heyday. The details
are known through records kept by the Usupovs, as well as letters
penned by famous writers and diplomats who visited the sprawling
manor.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have details about everything, from the colors of the walls
and the type of wood needed for parquet floors. We now have money
we need to restore. The only enemy standing between us and our goal
is time,'' said Lomakin, who oversaw the renovation at Moscow's
famous Tretyakov Art Gallery, which now draws more visitors and
more money than during Soviet rule.
</P>
<P>
   The first order of business at Arkangelskoe is to rebuild roofs
and walls to protect the art before the onset of winter. Once that
job is done, Lomakin said he would need another two years to get
Arkangelskoe's other buildings restored and a hotel built to
accommodate tourists.
</P>
<P>
   In between other projects, including the Millennium monument in
Washington, Cook expects to return to Russia to consult with
Lomakin and other craftsmen. He says cooperation is the key to
success.
</P>
<P>
   ``Russians want to revive these symbols of national heritage,
and we want to help them. With us both working together, we should
be fine,'' he said.

   ARKANGELSKOE, Russia _ In these halls trimmed in gold leaf and
adorned with elaborate frescos, coat-tailed men and bejeweled women
waltzed all night in annual balls that were the talk of salons from
St. Petersburg to Paris.
</P>
<P>
   In the shadows of flickering candles, swirling feet and
sumptuous feasts that epitomized 18th-Century European grandeur
were up to 20,000 serfs. They, like African slaves in the old
American South, grew crops, tended horses, cooked and cleaned house
until the Bolshevik Revolution swept this lifestyle and their
owners into the dustbin of history.
</P>
<P>
   Today, the homes that sparked literary masterpieces and
political upheaval lay mostly forgotten, in heaps of crumbling
plaster and overgrown weeds _ a neglect that a dedicated group of
Russians and Americans, including Atlanta architect Rodney M. Cook
Jr., hope to remedy.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a shame to let history be forgotten. These beautiful
buildings were of unique designs and home to untold treasures. We
in America and the rest of the world don't know what's here,'' Cook
told Cox Newspapers. ``We should.''
</P>
<P>
   Cook recently completed a two-week tour of Russia along with the
American Friends of Russian Estate Homes, a fund started in 1997 by
Priscilla Roosevelt, a great-niece of former U.S. President
Franklin D. Roosevelt. Its goal is to help restore Russian manors
as national museums.
</P>
<P>
   With the aid of seed money attracted through the Washington
D.C.-based fund, they hope to rebuild the stately homes and turn
these national monuments into money-making enterprises supported by
a tourist infrastructure that includes hotels, restaurants and
roads _ all in short supply in post-Soviet Russia.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a project to revive local pride, local history and local
economies. It shouldn't take a dedicated traveler to tackle the
Russian countryside and uncover these homes,'' Cook said.
</P>
<P>
   Cook, the designer of Atlanta's World Athletes Monument, is a
lifelong devotee of Russian culture, especially its architecture.
His fascination with Russian manors started as a boy, when he
remembers searching in vain for details about rare photographs of
old palaces and buildings in St. Petersburg and other Russian
cities.
</P>
<P>
   ``I remember the ache I would feel as a kid trying to find out
about these things. But it was the 'Evil Empire.' Everything
Russian was off-limits,'' he recalled. ``It was back then that I
caught what Priscilla and I call the 'Russian disease.'''
</P>
<P>
   Now, Cook boasts the second-largest private library of Russian
architecture books in the United States. He has even embellished
his Buckhead home with Russian flourishes, including onion domes
and an Orthodox cross on the roof.
</P>
<P>
   His own infatuation aside, Cook says there is plenty to draw
tourists to Russian estate homes; from the elegant, exotic
furnishings to the similarities with the old Southern plantation
homes that can still be found in places like South Carolina's low
country and Natchez, Miss.
</P>
<P>
   Arkangelskoe, a 10-acre sprawling estate some 15 miles from
Moscow's Kremlin and one of three estates that Roosevelt's
non-profit group is working with, is reminiscent of famous U.S.
landmarks. The main building, the living quarters for the former
owner, Prince Nikolai Usupov, is lined with columns like Thomas
Jefferson's Monticello and topped with a dome like the Capitol
rotunda in Washington.
</P>
<P>
   ``The rules of building (both plantation homes and Russian
estates) were the same. The only thing that differed was the
climate,'' Cook said.
</P>
<P>
   The bitter Russian climate and neglect of the properties during
70 years of Soviet rule are the two biggest reasons why the
mansions are in disrepair.
</P>
<P>
   At Arkangelskoe, Usupov had built a magnificent 200-seat
theater, where for nearly a century guests of his family would
enjoy art and music while perched in blue, velvet seats in a
wood-paneled hall. Now, the theater's roof is collapsing,
endangering a priceless art collection.
</P>
<P>
   With Cook's help, the theater has been named by the World
Monument Fund as one of the world's 100 most endangered sights.
This listing brought the directors of the Arkangelskoe (pronounced,
``ark-an-gul-skoy-ya'') museum their first foreign grants totaling
nearly $1 million to rebuild the theater. Now, Arkangelskoe is
looking for funds for the other 13 buildings on the grounds.
</P>
<P>
   Yuri Lomakin, Arkangelskoe's vice director, says he has an
accurate idea of how the estate looked in its heyday. The details
are known through records kept by the Usupovs, as well as letters
penned by famous writers and diplomats who visited the sprawling
manor.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have details about everything, from the colors of the walls
and the type of wood needed for parquet floors. We now have money
we need to restore. The only enemy standing between us and our goal
is time,'' said Lomakin, who oversaw the renovation at Moscow's
famous Tretyakov Art Gallery, which now draws more visitors and
more money than during Soviet rule.
</P>
<P>
   The first order of business at Arkangelskoe is to rebuild roofs
and walls to protect the art before the onset of winter. Once that
job is done, Lomakin said he would need another two years to get
Arkangelskoe's other buildings restored and a hotel built to
accommodate tourists.
</P>
<P>
   In between other projects, including the Millennium monument in
Washington, Cook expects to return to Russia to consult with
Lomakin and other craftsmen. He says cooperation is the key to
success.
</P>
<P>
   ``Russians want to revive these symbols of national heritage,
and we want to help them. With us both working together, we should
be fine,'' he said.

JAZZ MASTER &HT;    By MICHAEL D. CLARK
 &HT;    c. 2000 Houston Chronicle
<TEXT>
<P>
   Five-time Grammy winner. The only singer in history to win
best-vocalist awards in three categories _ jazz, pop and R&AMP;B. A
tenor larynx so uniquely clotted with cream it draws comparisons to
Johnny Mathis.
</P>
<P>
   It's hard to know which title best suits Al Jarreau.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can call me Al,'' laughs the golden-voiced singer,
crooning the chorus from the 1986 Paul Simon hit of the same name.
</P>
<P>
   Jarreau is calling from a hotel in Nice on the French Riviera,
an apple's throw from the Mediterranean. It's nearly 11 p.m.
paradise time, but the 60-year-old singer hasn't yet eaten dinner
or settled into his evening.
</P>
<P>
   With a tour schedule to keep, a band to front and a new album of
smooth R&AMP;B and jazz, ``Tomorrow Today,'' to promote, it's tough to
wind down. Jarreau may be in his third decade of recording music,
but his energy level still runs like that of a clubbing young
jazzman.
</P>
<P>
   A few days after this conversation, Jarreau was scheduled to
head back to the United States to headline the first Montreux
Festival on Tour. A traveling version of the premier Swiss jazz
celebration, the show also features Roberta Flack, saxophonist
David Sanborn, Houston-born jazz pianist Joe Sample and the George
Duke All-Star Band.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think I can turn on a fastball like I used to, but
I've found something in my life that makes me feel healthy,''
Jarreau says. ``I simply woke up on March 12 (his birthday) and
said, `Thank God I'm alive.'''
</P>
<P>
   Jarreau is much more than alive. He's revitalized. In recent
years, fans have seen him stretch from the concert stage to the
theater spotlight. He sang ``Teen Angel'' in the Broadway
production of ``Grease'' and did a guest spot on TV's ``Touched by
an Angel.''
</P>
<P>
   Musically, Jarreau spent a 19-year career on the Warner
Bros.-Reprise label but left the music giant after 1994's
``Tenderness'' album. He spent his hiatus from the studio working
on classical music, singing Bach and modern pieces by composer Lou
Harrison with the California Symphony.
</P>
<P>
   ``Tomorrow Today'' marks his return to recording the smooth jazz
and adult-contemporary music that have made his voice as distinct
as Nat King Cole's once was. After moving to Universal's GRP label,
a sister label of the Verve Music Group, Jarreau is recording on
the same brand name as did such past jazz greats as Ella Fitzgerald
and Count Basie.
</P>
<P>
   GRP/Verve is a much better fit for an artist like Jarreau. When
he started with Warner Bros.-Reprise, it catered mostly to artists
such as Joni Mitchell, Frank Sinatra and Eric Clapton. These days
it's better-known for younger, rock-oriented acts, such as Green
Day, Filter and Alanis Morissette.
</P>
<P>
   ``Leaving Reprise was as amicable as necessary separations can
be,'' Jarreau says. ``It was evident that I didn't fit in with
their interests anymore. (GRP/Verve) knows what I need. They've
been doing it for great artists for some time.''
</P>
<P>
   Officials at Reprise did not return phone calls regarding the
separation. Jarreau may not fit with its current lineup, but the
absence of his human harp of a voice is definitely a loss.
</P>
<P>
   A breathy, tailing collection of high notes, his croons have
sparked many romances, highlighted many weddings and even turned on
many TV sets. He was a Tuesday night prime-time mainstay when he
sang the theme song to the popular '80s Bruce Willis-Cybill
Shepherd detective comedy-drama ``Moonlighting.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The biggest thrill still comes from the guy on the street who
remembers a record or a song and says to me, `Al, I just wanted to
come over, shake your hand and say thanks,''' Jarreau says.
``That's a bigger thrill than a singer who says he wants to sing
like me.''
</P>
<P>
   His many studio albums have been well-received, but it was his
first live recording that won him critical and peer favor. ``Look
to the Rainbow'' earned him his first Grammy for best jazz vocal
performance in 1977.
</P>
<P>
   The double album was a masterpiece of scats and vocal
intonation. Jarreau was backed by a crack jazz quartet of
vibraphonist Lynn Blessing, keyboardist Tom Canning, bassist Abe
Laboriel and drummer Joe Carrero. Crisp live performances also have
been the linchpin keeping his career vital, especially during his
recent time between record labels.
</P>
<P>
   ``My work on the stage is a shared experience. The audience is
the other instrument,'' Jarreau says. ``The studio can fix things
and go back and change things. Live is raw, and I come from that.''
</P>
<P>
   His personal influences, Mathis and Cole, also come from the
live tradition.
</P>
<P>
   Jarreau never met Cole, who died in 1965, at age 47, of lung
cancer. He says that he and Mathis have been in the same room only
once, and that was during the 1985 studio sessions for the USA for
Africa benefit song ``We Are the World.''
</P>
<P>
   The obvious idea of trying to get Mathis and Jarreau on tour
together is mentioned, and the notion excites Jarreau.
</P>
<P>
   ``That gives me an idea,'' Jarreau says. ``People know that
Johnny can sing, but most don't know that he can also swing. I'd
love to tour with him, even if it was just a brief holiday tour of
seasonal music.''
</P>
<P>
   Jarreau has worked with and alongside a bevy of other
celebrities in his career. He and a young Harrison Ford were
classmates at small Ripon College in Wisconsin in the late '50s and
early '60s. The list of artists he's worked with runs from David
Benoit and Chick Corea to Nile Rodgers and Quincy Jones.
</P>
<P>
   His new album is as packed with guest stars as Carlos Santana's
``Supernatural'' was last year.
</P>
<P>
   ``Puddit,'' a remake of Sample's Jazz Crusaders number ``Put It
Where You Want It,'' features the pianist and is newly ornamented
with lyrics by Jarreau. Another instrumental for which Jarreau
supplied lyrics is ``Something That You Said,'' featuring trumpeter
Rick Braun. Fans of the Weather Report may recognize the tune
formerly called ``A Remark You Made.''
</P>
<P>
   The adult-radio pop of the duet ``God's Gift to the World,''
with Vanessa Williams, is accompanied by such romantic mood music
as ``Let Me Love You,'' featuring sax lines by Boney James. It's
contrasted with the salsa and scat of the title track and the soul
groove of ``In My Music.''
</P>
<P>
   Jarreau hints that he and Sample might play ``Puddit'' on tour.
He offers little else about what fans can expect with him, Sample,
Flack, Sanborn and Duke in the same building.
</P>
<P>
   ``Being involved with Montreux is special,'' says Jarreau, who
follows in the footsteps of Count Basie, Miles Davis and Chuck
Berry. All played the festival when it was an annual event in the
Swiss city it's named for.
</P>
<P>
   ``The shows will be a celebration of tradition.''
</P>
<P>
   Just call his voice a treasure.

<TEXT>
<P>
   Here are some tips on how to be a model youth-sports parent:
</P>

   1. Remember that where we practice and play games is like your
child's classroom _ respect the classroom.
</P>
<P>
   2. Make only positive, encouraging comments to the players on
both teams.
</P>
<P>
   3. Making mistakes is part of the learning process _ don't
criticize.
</P>
<P>
   4. Discuss your concern away from the players and, in
particular, away from your child.
</P>
<P>
   5. Respect the officials.
</P>
<P>
   6. Focus on fun and participation rather than winning and
losing.
</P>
<P>
   7. Control your emotions.
</P>
<P>
   8. Learn the rules of your child's sport.
</P>
<P>
   9. Reinforce the coach's instructions when practicing with your
child at home.
</P>
<P>
   10. Remember, positive reinforcement is the key to improvement.
</P>
<P>
   11. Don't undermine team morale.
</P>
<P>
   12. Participate in team activities.

(REPEATING FOR ALL NEEDING) &HT;    A RARE LEADER
 &HT;    By MARIANNE MEANS
 &HT;    c.2000 Hearst Newspapers
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHILADELPHIA _ Only rarely in history does a public figure come
along with great stature and popularity _ and no ambition to become
president.
</P>
<P>
   In retired Gen. Colin Powell, the country has such a remarkable
personage, a worthy successor to two other generals content to let
their fame speak for them _ George C. Marshall and Douglas
MacArthur.
</P>
<P>
   It is, of course, part of their charm that although they could
not entirely escape the tentacles of presidential politics, they
never sought the office for themselves.
</P>
<P>
   Why would Powell want the presidency anyway? He's already more
widely respected than President Clinton or this year's two main
presidential contenders. Some other fellows who build national
reputations look good until they let the public adulation go to
their heads, start to pick and choose among controversial issues
and stoop to name-calling. Suddenly, they make enemies and don't
seem so perfect any more. That happened to Ralph Nader, once a
greatly admired consumer advocate and now just a millionaire
egotist running for president as a spoiler.
</P>
<P>
   But it is difficult to find other leaders to compare Powell
with. Alas, he is one of a kind. Democratic guru Robert Strauss,
former ambassador to the old Soviet Union, comes close. So do
former Armed Services Chairman Sam Nunn, D-Ga., the late House
Speaker Sam Rayburn and the late Senate Republican Leader Everett
Dirksen.
</P>
<P>
   All giants, none White House occupants. But there aren't many
more.
</P>
<P>
   Powell's rare position at the pinnacle of public life was
dramatized at the Republican National Convention when no less than
Gov. George W. Bush himself, speaking via satellite, delivered a
lavish introduction to Powell's speech, an unprecedented compliment
from a future presidential nominee.
</P>
<P>
   Powell went on to demonstrate his talent for words of wisdom,
urging greater national efforts to improve education, expand
opportunities for racial minorities and apply common sense to
foreign affairs.
</P>
<P>
   The speech was clearly a warm-up for a role as Bush's secretary
of state, a job Powell does want.
</P>
<P>
   Powell, who was President Bush's chairman of the Joint Chiefs of
Staff and a central strategist in Operation Desert Storm that
forced Iraq out of Kuwait, is so universally popular that President
Clinton tried to lure him into the Democratic Party, and Dubya, as
his campaign heated up, repeatedly dangled the vice presidential
nomination. But Powell had promised his wife Alma _ who worried
that as the first African American on a major national political
ticket he might be assassinated _ that he would neither run for
president nor vice president. The Cabinet, however, is a different
matter.
</P>
<P>
   Powell's performance was a dandy. It fit neatly into the
convention theme of kindly inclusiveness but it demanded that
Republicans really mean it . He didn't spare his audience of mostly
white delegates,
</P>
<P>
   reminding them forcefully that giving minorities a competitive
chance is an everyday task, not just a campaign-year slogan. ``Some
in our party roundly and loudly condemn affirmative action that
helped a few thousand black kids get an education, but hardly a
whimper is heard from them over affirmative action for lobbyists
who load our federal tax codes with preferences for special
interests,''' he thundered. Ouch. A painful truth.
</P>
<P>
   Everyone knew that Powell was a loyal Bush backer. He could get
away with dumping a little rain on Bush's sunny parade here. In
fact, there's not much he can't get away with. Nobody can accuse
him of not being his own man.
</P>
<P>
   He also lectured the Republicans on the proper uses of military
power, warning that our armed strength cannot serve just ``the
well-to-do, the comfortable, the privileged.'' He talked about
national education initiatives that go further than the GOP
platform proposals. He is on the team, but not singing by rote from
the party script.
</P>
<P>
   Powell arrived at his invincible position the hard way _ he
earned it. He rose steadily through the military ranks before he
became a White House fellow in 1972. There, he was discovered by
Reagan and Bush administration officials who were excited to find
an articulate, discreet, intelligent and conservative black officer
capable of leading armies. Given their trust, Powell delivered. And
so did they.
</P>
<P>
   In the early years of our republic, career military men often
made it to the White House. But since World War II a uniform has
seldom been a boost to a political career. Powell is so exceptional
it is difficult to compare him with past heroes.
</P>
<P>
   When he retired as a four-star general in 1993, he wrote a
memoir that sold like Pennsylvania pretzels and further enhanced
his reputation. Recently, he has directed a national project to
encourage community volunteerism to help children _ an effort that
has bipartisan support.
</P>
<P>
   His selfless service ranks up there with that of the great Gen.
George C. Marshall, a World War II hero who served as President
Harry Truman's secretary of state and initiated the massive postwar
aid program that rebuilt Europe and became known as the Marshall
Plan. Marshall, who had his hands full with conservatives who
feared he was wasting money overseas, had no interest in seeking
the presidency.
</P>
<P>
   Another great general was Douglas MacArthur, who was so popular
in his day that when Truman fired him in 1951 for refusing to
follow orders in Korea, MacArthur was greeted by cheering crowds
and a ticker-tape parade in New York City. A week after he was
fired, he addressed a joint session of Congress and delivered his
famous line that ``old soldiers never die; they just fade away.''
In 1952, some Republicans launched a boomlet for him for president,
but MacArthur discouraged it. Besides, Gen. Dwight Eisenhower and
Sen. Robert Taft had the delegates.
</P>
<P>
   Powell doesn't have any delegates either. He doesn't need them.
He has himself, which is quite enough.

HOUSEHOLD CHORES TEACH CHILDREN RESPONSIBILITY AND SELF-RESPECT  
</HEADLINE>
 KIDSCHORES KANSAS -KAN   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JAMES A. FUSSELL   
 c. 2000 The Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Most parents do a fine job of meeting their children's needs.
They give them food, shelter, love. But parents should add one more
thing to that list, says author Christine Field.
</P>
<P>
   Chores. Your children should be folding the laundry, raking the
leaves, putting away groceries.
</P>
<P>
   The reason is simple, Field said. These and thousands of other
age-appropriate tasks help build responsibility, relationships and
self-respect.
</P>
<P>
   In her new book, Life Skills for Kids, Field explains how
important it is for parents to involve their children early in fun
work experiences.
</P>
<P>
   It's not hard, she said. ``It's just living life, letting your
children come along side. In that way you'll be having fun with
your children while teaching them valuable life lessons.''
</P>
<P>
   Other parenting authorities agree. Dale Walker, assistant
professor of human development at the University of Kansas, said
involving children in fun family chores enhances family
communication, strengthens family bonds and offers numerous
``teachable moments.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Every time you interact with (your children) you have a chance
to expand upon the lessons you are teaching,'' Walker said.
</P>
<P>
   Field practiced law for eight years before quitting to become a
full-time mom. She decided to write the book when she discovered
that her eldest daughter could read anything in the library but
didn't know how to dry dishes.
</P>
<P>
   Now that's all changed.
</P>
<P>
   ``In our family we start when the kids are young to give them
real things to do in a stable, predictable routine,'' she said.
``When my son was about 16 months old he loved to be with me when I
was folding clothes. Of course, he wasn't any help. But I would
still give him washcloths to fold. Now Daniel is 3 and he's our
towel man. He folds all the towels and puts them in the linen
closet. He feels like he is needed. He feels like he is counted
on.''
</P>
<P>
   Kids most want to help when they're ages 2 to 5, parenting
experts say. But that's also when their help isn't always that
helpful. Many parents don't want to deal with it, and simply tell
the child to go watch a video. That's easier, but parents miss a
golden opportunity.
</P>
<P>
   KU's Walker says: ``Don't expect your (young) child to be able
to set the whole table, but they certainly can carry the big forks
and the little forks and place them in the appropriate places. And
they'll learn from that. They'll learn colors, to discriminate and
prepositions such as under, up, beneath, below etc.''
</P>
<P>
   The lists on this page will give you some ideas of
age-appropriate chores for your children. Let the chores begin!
Ages 2-3
</P>
<P>
   Help make the bed (pull covers up)
</P>
<P>
   Hang clothing on hooks
</P>
<P>
   Carry laundry to and from the laundry area
</P>
<P>
   Help feed the animals
</P>
<P>
   Help wipe up spills

WHINERS AND LOSERS: IN THE GAME OF GOOD SPORTS, MANY PARENTS AND
FANS ARE FOULING OUT
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
   (UNDATED)_They can strike terror on the field _ huffing and
puffing at the referee, stomping their feet and swearing up a new
storm of the century.
</P>
<P>
   ``What kind of (bleeping) call was that, zebra?''
</P>
<P>
   ``Ref, you $%!''
</P>
<P>
   Not the kids. These are the parents. Adults who drive their
children by minivan to sporting events that traditionally preach
sportsmanship over winning.
</P>
<P>
   Lately it seems that once they set foot near an athletic field,
some moms, dads and coaches lose their grasp on sportsmanship,
civility _ even reality.
</P>
<P>
   A Massachusetts man is accused of fatally beating another father
this month in a dispute over a youth hockey game. The father and
coach of a Little Leaguer in Florida broke an umpire's jaw because
he disliked a call. And a Virginia mother slapped a 14-year-old
official during a soccer game.
</P>
<P>
   Youth sports experts and referees say parents are becoming
increasingly involved in their children's sports activities, and
they need to learn two things: the rules of the game and the rules
of conduct for spectators.
</P>
<P>
   The Houston area lacks clinics or workshops dedicated to
teaching parents how to behave at their children's baseball, soccer
or basketball games.
</P>
<P>
   But that's about to change.
</P>
<P>
   &UR;
</P>
<P>
   Shifting directions &LR;
</P>
<P>
   The Timberline Youth Soccer Association will have an online
training class for parents by fall. It will teach them the basic
rules of soccer and sideline etiquette and give them parenting
tips. Parents who complete the course will receive a discount on
membership fees.
</P>
<P>
   The association, which handles games for about 11,000 kids who
live north of Houston, is launching the class because of parental
behavior problems, says president Ed Loucks.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a big problem. It really is,'' Loucks says. ``I don't
want to blow it out of proportion, but I don't want to minimize it,
either. We've got about 10 percent of the people causing 100
percent of the problems.''
</P>
<P>
   During the past year a parent was banned from games for bumping
a referee, he says.
</P>
<P>
   Loucks says most of the troublemakers are parents who want to
relive their glory days or make up for their dismal sports careers
through their children.
</P>
<P>
   ``We recognized a couple of years ago that parents' expectations
of their kids far exceeded their abilities,'' he says. ``So now
we're working on education to give parents some yardsticks to
measure their kids _ in the real world.''
</P>
<P>
   Loucks can speak this way of other parents because, well, he was
one of them.
</P>
<P>
   He was never abusive to coaches or referees, he says, but he was
guilty of ``over-encouraging'' his teen-age daughter. This from a
father who played in a state championship football game 25 years
ago.
</P>
<P>
   ``I pushed her too hard,'' Loucks recalls. ``I would stand on
the side of the field and shout instructions at her: `Look over
your shoulder!' `Watch the ball!' You spend so much time trying to
make them the best they can be, you forget they just want to have
fun.''
</P>
<P>
   Then, it happened. His daughter spoke up after a game.
</P>
<P>
   ``She said `You know, I'd have more fun if you didn't yell so
much,''' Loucks says.
</P>
<P>
   So he changed for the better.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm an example of a bad parent gone good,'' Loucks says. ``And
others can do it, too.''
</P>
<P>
   &UR;
</P>
<P>
   Model programs &LR;
</P>
<P>
   In Florida, the Jupiter-Tequesta Athletic Association, which has
about 6,000 kids in six sports including baseball and soccer,
requires parents to attend such a workshop. Otherwise their
children don't play. This group was the first in the nation to make
such a bold move in November 1999.
</P>
<P>
   The nonprofit National Alliance for Youth Sports, based in West
Palm Beach, Fla., offers a national program called Parents
Association for Youth Sports, which provides training and a code of
ethics for parents. Only three such programs are in place in Texas
_ in Copperas Cove, El Paso and Nueces County (Corpus Christi).
</P>
<P>
   ``Parents are behaving and acting the way they do because no one
has ever told them they couldn't,'' says Fred Engh, founder and
president of the national alliance and the author of ``Why Johnny
Hates Sports.`` ``No one is there to tell them if they keep acting
like this, they're out of here.''
</P>
<P>
   He contends that parents, coaches and administrators should take
orientation courses, sign a code of ethics and be held accountable
for bad behavior.
</P>
<P>
   ``This finally raises the standards for children's sports,''
Engh says. ``Implement this, and you will have a dramatic change
(in parents' behavior).''
</P>
<P>
   Parents interested in the association's program for parents,
which costs $5 to join, should tell the directors of their leagues,
clubs or associations, who can contact the national alliance about
creating a chapter.
</P>
<P>
   Once a chapter is approved, parents then sign up and watch
training videos, participate in a discussion with other parents and
sign an 11-item Parents' Code of Ethics pledge. They then get
buttons with positive slogans to wear at games _ reminders to be on
their best behavior.
</P>
<P>
   Slogans include ``Having fun is No. 1'' and ``All kids are
winners'' and ``Good sports make good sports.''
</P>
<P>
   About 5,000 parents nationwide have gone through the alliance's
training program since it began in February, Engh says.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Aggressive behavior &LR;
</P>
<P>
   Bob Still, spokesman for the 19,000-member National Association
of Sports Officials, says referees saw an increase in violence
coming years ago, among both players and spectators.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's been more physical contact with officials than ever
before,'' he says. ``We're a more violent society, and sports is
life with the violence turned up.''
</P>
<P>
   Still says parents and coaches have lost touch with what youth
sports are supposed to be about: sportsmanship, physical fitness
and fun.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think today we're teaching `gamesmanship' _ do whatever it
takes to win the game,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   Steven Ellinger, a Houston lawyer who has been a referee for 25
years, is an advocate of more parental education.
</P>
<P>
   He says people see coaches berating officials and players
striking coaches in college and professional games, and they think
it's ``fashionable'' to be aggressive.
</P>
<P>
   At youth sports games, he says, this scenario is common: parents
who know little about the game, no security and inexperienced
officials. The result: rampant verbal and physical abuse.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a lot easier for a parent to yell at the official than go
through a training class,'' Ellinger says. ``If ignorance is bliss,
then there are a lot of happy people out there.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, who officiates high school, college and semipro games,
says officials are quitting because they're tired of being berated
by parents and coaches. In youth sports, most officials are working
as volunteers or for little pay. The field is seeing a nationwide
shortage at all levels, Still says.
</P>
<P>
   ``Many good officials are turning around saying they no longer
want to do this,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   Fourteen states have laws that provide stiff penalties for
assaults on sports officials, Still says. He expects the Texas
Legislature to take up the issue during the 2001 session.
</P>
<P>
   ``As a representative of authority, it's no different than
hitting a police officer,'' Still says.
</P>
<P>
   He says leagues should develop or implement an education program
for parents. If such a program doesn't modify a parent's bad
behavior, then that parent should be banned from the league, Still
says.
</P>
<P>
   ``There needs to be zero tolerance,'' he says. ``Leagues need to
step up and manage themselves properly. They need to be able to
say, `We don't need this person around.' It's for the greater good
of everyone else.''
</P>
<P>
   &UR;
</P>
<P>
   The right way to act &LR;
</P>
<P>
   According to the National Alliance for Youth Sports, a 1999
survey of 500 adults found that 82 percent believe parents behave
too aggressively at youth sports events. Fifty-six percent said
they had seen such behavior, and 72 percent said such aggressive
parents should be banned from youth sports.
</P>
<P>
   $$$
</P>
<P>
   To get back on the right track, Engh says, parents must first
give their children unconditional support.
</P>
<P>
   ``They are growing and developing lifelong characteristics of
who they will become,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   Avoid negative criticism and derogatory language.
</P>
<P>
   ``Never, never humiliate them,'' says Engh, a father of seven.
``That will destroy your relationship.''
</P>
<P>
   Let your children choose the sports they want to play.
</P>
<P>
   It's OK to cheer and clap in the stands, he says. But don't tell
them they made a mistake. They already know it.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, tell your children that it's OK to lose or to fail.
``Tell them they can learn from it,'' Engh says.
</P>
<P>
   &UR;
</P>
<P>
   Reaction &LR;
</P>
<P>
   Randy Conger, president of the Bay Area Youth Soccer Association
south of Houston, says the last violent episode in his association
happened in April 1999, when a teen-age player punched a
19-year-old referee.
</P>
<P>
   The player was suspended for a year by the South Texas Youth
Soccer Association and has not reapplied to the Bay Area
association, Conger says.
</P>
<P>
   Some referees drop out because of parents' behavior, says
Conger, who's been involved in youth soccer for 16 years. But
despite high-profile instances of violence in youth sports, he
isn't expecting a drop in participation when play begins in
September. Bay Area has 17 clubs with about 10,000 kids ages 4-18.
</P>
<P>
   Conger says the South Texas association is finalizing a code of
ethics for parents, coaches, managers and players. It should be
ready by February, he says.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've been wanting it for a couple of years,'' he says. ``I
think anything that will make the game safer, we could all use.''
</P>
<P>
   In the meantime, the association created sportsmanship awards
for 6- and 7-year-olds and their coaches.
</P>
<P>
   ``It makes everyone remember why they are there,'' Conger says.
</P>
<P>
   Conger says education may help curb the problem. The Bay Area
association offers coaching clinic for parents so that they can
gain a better understanding of the game. About 30 percent take
advantage of that, Conger says.
</P>
<P>
   &UR;
</P>
<P>
   Better safe than sorry &LR;
</P>
<P>
   The Timberline Youth Soccer Association expects _ and wants _
thousands of parents at its games this fall. The overwhelming
majority will be supportive of all players, coaches and referees.
</P>
<P>
   To monitor the rest though, the association is going to dispatch
its 100 board members this fall to check for overzealous or
dangerous behavior in the stands or on the fields.
</P>
<P>
   ``It happens. We know it happens, and we're on guard to watch
out for it,'' Loucks says. ``If you only came to say negative
things, don't come at all.''

IT CAME OUT OF THE BLUE, OR DID IT? 
</HEADLINE>
   By SUSAN SWARTZ   
 The Press Democrat, Santa Rosa , Calif.   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   The mothers take turns grieving
for each other.
<TEXT>
<P>
   ``It must be such a shock,'' Mary says to Johanna about her
loss.
</P>
<P>
   ``But such agony for you,'' says Johanna to Mary.
</P>
<P>
   You think, is it possible that one is worse than the other? For
your child to suddenly die. Or your child to slowly die.
</P>
<P>
   The mothers are in their 60s and their children are adults, but
no matter the age, for your child to get sick and die before you do
is out of whack.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not part of the natural scheme,'' says Mary.
</P>
<P>
   It's not that cancer ever makes any sense, or that children
don't die. These women are plenty familiar with unfairness, but on
this they seem desperate to find an explanation for what made their
able, healthy children suddenly vulnerable.
</P>
<P>
   Living in environmentally-sensitive Sonoma County, Calif., they
don't whisper their fears that their children may have been
poisoned by something they lived with. Maybe when their children
were babies there was something in the tap water, or maybe they
unknowingly walked through a noxious cloud on the way to school.
</P>
<P>
   The women know about communities looking to factories and wells
to figure out why a neighborhood has so many cancers. For a time in
the San Francisco Bay Area environmental causes were suspected for
a high incidence of breast cancer, although studies now link it to
women delaying childbearing, which prolongs their exposure to
estrogen, and also to early detection methods.
</P>
<P>
   Still, you always want to know: Why cancer, why now?
</P>
<P>
   ``We were the Viking family,'' says Johanna, her face full of
pain and puzzlement. Her children, like her and their father, were
tall and blond and athletic.
</P>
<P>
   ``Maybe we were arrogant,'' she says, as if cancer was a
punishment.

   Johanna's son Bruce, 35, died in May of a rapidly moving
leukemia. He went into a Michigan hospital on a Friday with
abdominal pains and on Wednesday Johanna was told he had leukemia
and was being given massive doses of chemotherapy. The mother was
on her way to fly to Michigan when she called the hospital and was
told her son was gone.
</P>
<P>
   ``They said, `I'm sorry. He has expired.' I said, `No. You don't
understand. I'm calling about my son,' and they said, `Yes, that's
the name.' ''
</P>
<P>
   Mary's daughter Diane, 44, mother of four and a computer
graphics student, had pains in her chest last Christmas which she
blamed on a lingering cold. It turned out to be breast cancer and
she had a mastectomy. Now the cancer is in her bones.
</P>
<P>
   A recent report in the New England Journal of Medicine said that
cancer is more often tied to lifestyle than genes. While family
history is a factor in 30 percent of cancer cases, the report cited
lifestyle choices in diet, exercise and tobacco use as more apt to
influence who gets cancer.
</P>
<P>
   What about toxins and pesticides, the runoff from factories,
those contaminants people discover and make crusading movies about,
Johanna and Mary want to know.
</P>
<P>
   Ironically, Johanna's son had chosen a career in environmental
management and had a new job heading a recycling center. Maybe he
was sickened by something when he worked at an airport in
Massachusetts or at a lab in California, Johanna says, seeking a
connection.
</P>
<P>
   ``We lived in Spain for a while. Maybe there was something
there.''
</P>
<P>
   Mary says there is no cancer history in her daughter's family.
As for lifestyle causes, she says, ``Diane eats better than anyone
I know and drinks filtered water. She's far more health conscious
than me and I'm as healthy as a horse.''
</P>
<P>
   I know a 30-year-old with lymphoma who grew up near a large
chemical company. She used to sit on the town bridge and throw
rocks at the mounds of white gunk that floated on top of the river.
Is that what got her?
</P>
<P>
   Johanna and Mary are not Erin Brokovich types, ready to go on a
rampage. Right now Johanna is too fragile to do much more than
travel to Michigan to ask more questions of her son's doctors.
Mary, who is caring for her daughter and her youngest grandchild,
is too much ``in overwhelm'' to raise a ruckus.
</P>
<P>
   But you can expect them to point fingers if and when they find
something to point at.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some of my friends tell me that it's time to seek closure for
Bruce's death,'' says Johanna. ``I hate that word, closure. I'm
just starting.''

<TEXT>
<P>
   Once upon a time, immigrant families turned to the public
schools to Americanize their children: teach them English,
introduce them to the broader culture, and point them in the
direction of the streets paved with gold.
</P>
<P>
   But today, as the melting pot metaphor is eclipsed by
multiculturalism, more and more Americans are rejecting public
schools and turning to home schooling in an effort to safeguard
their children's cultural and religious identity.
</P>
<P>
   Muslims, one of the United States' fastest-growing populations,
are following the lead of other groups, including evangelical
Christians, in opting out of American public schools.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're growing up as Americans, and they have to integrate,
but we want them to keep their Islamic identity intact, and not
have it washed away or assaulted,'' said Beverly Beresford, a
36-year-old Muslim mother of three teaching her children at home.
</P>
<P>
   The surge in home schooling is part of a broader trend in which
many Americans driven by moral as well as educational concerns are
choosing religious, charter, and pilot schools for their children.
For some, it's a development that raises fundamental, even
troubling, questions about the future of public education.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are living at a time in which the schools are under attack,
and people are seeking alternatives,'' said Arthur E. Levine,
president of Teachers College at Columbia University.
</P>
<P>
   ``The nature of socialization has also changed,'' he said.
``Once the hope of people entering was that they would become
Americanized and indistinct from the pack. Now we're having a
battle over how much we want in common and how much we want to be
different.''
</P>
<P>
   Muslim home-schoolers scoff at the suggestion that their
children might somehow be isolated from the larger culture because
they are home schooled. Their children play in sports leagues with
non-Muslim children, go on field trips with non-Muslim children,
meet with non-Muslim home-schoolers, and are inundated with
mainstream American culture, they say.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're not trying to withdraw or create a shell _ that's
unrealistic and unfair to the children,'' Beresford said.
</P>
<P>
   The challenge, Beresford and other parents say, is communicating
Islamic faith, history, and values to their children in the face of
the broader and more dominant culture.
</P>
<P>
   ``Muslims are a new, emerging community, and a number of them
are not happy with the public-schooling system, either because they
feel that the schools are not really teaching their kids right or
they object that they are not paying attention to moral issues,''
said Aly Abuzaakouk, executive director of the American Muslim
Council, who said education is the top concern of Muslims in
America. ``There is a secular turn in public schooling that Muslim
families are not happy with, and some of those who are not able to
join Muslim schools do home schooling.''
</P>
<P>
   The Muslim home-schooling movement resembles, and in some ways
piggybacks on, the wider home-schooling movement popularized by
evangelical Christians since the 1980s. The Christian
home-schoolers cite many of the same reasons as Muslims _ a desire
to inculcate their children with values and behavioral norms that
are off-limits in public schools.
</P>
<P>
   ``If a person has a strong belief in the area of religion,
they're going to want to pass it on to their children, and the only
effective way is to teach them at home,'' said Michael Smith,
president of the Home School Legal Defense Association.
</P>
<P>
   The organization estimates that 1.7 million American youngsters
are now home schooled _ a number contested as too high by some _
and although the majority are thought to be white evangelical
Christians with highly educated parents, Smith said his group is
seeing rapid growth in home schooling among other religious groups,
such as Muslims and Catholics.
</P>
<P>
   But for American Muslims _ an ethnically diverse and
fast-growing group whose population is estimated to be 6 million to
7 million _ it is not yet clear whether home schooling will be a
permanent part of the landscape or a temporary phenomenon until the
community builds more private schools. Already there are two Muslim
grade schools in Greater Boston, the Al-Hamra Academy in
Northborough and the Islamic Academy of New England in Sharon.
</P>
<P>
   There are no statistics about the numbers of Muslim
home-schoolers in this country, but it is clear that most Muslims
still send their children to public schools and depend on weekend
Islamic schools for religious instruction.
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, there are several organizations devoted to the
topic, including the Muslim Home School Network
(www.muslimhomeschool.com), which is hosting a home-schooling
convention in Sharon on Saturday and Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   The organization is directed by Cynthia Sulaiman, a mother of
four, who started her eldest children in the public schools but
then decided to teach her family at home.
</P>
<P>
   Like Sulaiman, Beresford sent her eldest son to public school
for a year before deciding to try home schooling.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our local school is quite good, but we felt that because in
Islam, you want to integrate religion into all aspects of life, we
could achieve that better by home schooling,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Beresford and Sulaiman teach their children at home for some of
the same reasons cited by other home-schooling parents: a desire
for safety, a concern about the secular nature of public schools,
and a hope their children will do better with individual attention.
But they have other, less familiar concerns: They want their
children to pray five times a day, they want their daughters to be
able to cover their heads without fear of teasing, and they don't
want boys mixing socially with girls.
</P>
<P>
   They teach the basics _ reading, writing, and mathematics _
alongside Islamic history, culture, and religion.
</P>
<P>
   Beresford and Sulaiman are both converts to Islam who married
immigrants from Islamic countries. Scholars say home schooling has
been particularly popular among American Muslim families in which
at least one parent was born in the United States, perhaps because
the home-schooling phenomenon is most familiar to Americans, and
perhaps because of a concern that children of converts are thought
to be less likely to retain their parents' chosen faith.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are more parents who want to do it, but feel they are
not equipped, and those who are equipped are often African-American
or Euro-American Muslims,'' said Shabbir Mansuri, executive
director of the Council on Islamic Education, a California-based
organization that works to improve and expand the depiction of
Islam and Muslims in textbooks.
</P>
<P>
   Variations of home schooling, such as groups of families
teaching their children together, have been popular particularly
among African-American Muslims, said Ilyas Ba-Yunus, a sociologist
at State University of New York at Cortland.
</P>
<P>
   ``Many of these people are new converts who are very unhappy
with the drugs and guns and dating and sex that they consider to be
un-Islamic,'' Ba-Yunus said. ``They think their own teaching at
home will be morally strong, and that they will be able to counter
whatever immoral things are happening in school. They're not always
successful, but this is their logic.''

MORE SETBACKS FOR BARAK AS FOREIGN MINISTER RESIGNS 
</HEADLINE>
  (EDS: This early version will be updated by 9 p.m. EDT with a
Jerusalem datelined story by John Kifner.)  
 By CHRISTOPHER S. WREN   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Israel's embattled Prime Minister Ehud Barak suffered fresh
political setbacks Wednesday when his foreign minister, David Levy,
resigned and the parliament approved the first reading of
legislation calling for early elections.
</P>
<P>
   The problems came just before a three-month parliamentary recess
that Barak hopes will give him enough breathing space to shore up
his government.
</P>
<P>
   His governing coalition lost its parliamentary majority last
month, when three right-leaning parties quit to protest his
decision to attend the summit meeting with the Palestinian leader,
Yasser Arafat, at Camp David, Md.
</P>
<P>
   Since Barak's return from Camp David, he has survived two
no-confidence votes sponsored by the opposition Likud Party, which
objects to making any concessions to the Palestinians. The same
hostility contributed to the humiliating defeat Monday of former
Prime Minister Shimon Peres, a Nobel Prize laureate, in
parliament's election of a new Israeli president.
</P>
<P>
   Levy, 62, complained that he had ``no option'' but to resign
because Barak had offered irreversible compromises on the status of
Jerusalem to the Palestinians at the Camp David summit meeting.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   ``For the first time, on the issue of Jerusalem, we were
prepared to divide Jerusalem, and even at this moment there is no
way back from this promise,'' said Levy, who left Likud a year ago
to join Barak's coalition. As foreign minister, Levy refused to
attend the Camp David summit meeting.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have gone down a path leading to the division of Jerusalem,
not just Arab areas, but the very heart of the old city of
Jerusalem,'' he complained Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   The summit meeting collapsed after Barak continued to maintain
that Jerusalem was indivisible, though he offered limited
administrative control to the Palestinians in the Arab
neighborhoods of east Jerusalem, which Arafat rejected. The
Palestinians insist upon sovereignty over east Jerusalem, which
Israeli troops captured in the 1967 war.
</P>
<P>
   The prime minister told reporters that he could not pretend to
have no regrets about Levy's departure. ``I have a great deal of
respect for David Levy,'' Barak said, according to Agence
France-Presse.
</P>
<P>
   ``But I am committed to the principles that government came into
power to implement,'' he continued, ``and consequently I will
continue to work towards strengthening peace and security and
further developing our economy.''
</P>
<P>
   Barak expressed confidence that his coalition would be
revitalized once the ``hubbub of the last few days'' died down over
the next few weeks. ``We will be able to broaden the basis of the
government and continue into the future to achieve our
objectives,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   In the rambunctious parliamentary session Wednesday, Likud and
its allies pushed through the preliminary reading of a bill that
would dissolve the government and hold new elections, which
otherwise are not due before 2003. Four of five motions on the bill
received the necessary majority of 61 votes in the 120-seat
legislature, and the fifth received 60 votes.
</P>
<P>
   Likud's victory has no immediate practical effect, because the
bill now goes to a parliamentary committee controlled by Barak's
party. The proposal must be approved in three more readings before
it can become law.
</P>
<P>
   The parliament's recess in theory gives Barak until late October
to reshuffle his government, which has been reduced to 42
parliamentary seats, and to show enough progress in continuing
talks with the Palestinians to allow Barak to call new elections to
present his peace policy to Israeli voters.
</P>
<P>
   However, the parliament could call back its members from
vacation if 25 legislators formally request it, an unusual step
that Likud and its allies have sufficient strength to take.
</P>

THE LATEST IN SUMMER REALITY CHECKS: `AMERICAN HIGH' 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MATTHEW GILBERT  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
AMERICAN HIGH 
Directed by: R.J. Cutler 
On: Fox 
Time: Wednesdays at 9 p.m. 
Rated: TVPG 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Someday soon, someone will make a reality TV series about the
making of a reality TV series. It will be called ``Big Brother's
Big Brother'' or ``The Real Real World,'' and it will show us
exactly how a reality series is filmed and edited over time. But
until that doubly self-conscious moment arrives, we must settle for
the sort of plain old ordinary keyhole-peeping that has become the
TV format of the summer.
</P>
<P>
   Actually, ``American High,'' which follows a year in the lives
of 14 suburban Chicago high school kids, is a reality series that
has some relatively serious, documentary aspirations. Yes, it is
edited with the same rhythmic exuberance and sass of ``The Real
World'' and other MTV nonfictional programming. And it is indeed a
kind of TV-sanctioned spying, as we follow these teens from their
morning-hygiene rituals to the evening dinner table.
</P>
<P>
   But because the overall themes are the pains of post-adolescence
and the anxiety of facing adulthood in an uncertain world, the show
ends up seeming like more than an exercise in MTV hipness. It's not
quite fantasy reality.
</P>
<P>
   The half-hour show _ the premiere featured back-to-back episodes
_ is meant to provide a medium-deep portrait of ``kids today.''
Many of the 14 subjects in ``American High'' hang out in different
cliques, and they have been chosen, like most reality casts, to
cover a range of types. There's an alternative singer-songwriter
who wears funky glasses; a pair of easygoing football jocks; a
troublemaker with attention deficit disorder issues; and, of
course, an openly gay student who wants to be an artist.
</P>
<P>
   The show jumps quickly from one life to another, but it's
carefully organized by the director, R. J. Cutler (who also helmed
``The War Room''), to keep you from being confused about who's who.
It also maintains a nice balance between home-life shots,
school-corridor action, and the ``diary'' footage filmed by the
students themselves.
</P>
<P>
   Amid the expected tales of unrequited love and peer pressure,
Cutler follows an unusual friendship between mellow jock Robby (who
says, ``On the inside I just got a lot of love'') and Brad, the gay
kid. They are from very different segments of the school
population, but that doesn't appear to threaten their playful
relationship.
</P>
<P>
   Robby's girlfriend, Sarah, is uncomfortable with the friendship,
though, and Brad shakes his head in disbelief when Robby shares
that information with him. Sarah, meanwhile, is painfully attached
to Robby _ ``You're all I have really in life,'' she says _ and
when Robby gets a college acceptance letter, fear is written all
over her face. Clearly, Sarah has a long journey of
self-realization ahead of her.
</P>
<P>
   The kids in ``American High'' appear extraordinarily comfortable
being filmed, which may be indigenous to either their tender age or
their generation, steeped in media-heavy culture. Some of them,
Kaytee the musician, for instance, are natural-born performers, but
none of them appears to be using the show as a professional
steppingstone. (See: ``The Real World.'') They're too steeped in
the immediacy of homework assignments, homeroom crushes, and angst
about the future to be plotting a path.
</P>
<P>
   The sequences that focus on Morgan, a hyperactive kid who is
both angry and needy, are the show's most powerful. Intelligent,
mouthy, and tightly wound, he harasses his younger brother, tests
his father's patience, and rejects the idea of improving his
grades. He works overtime to hide his compassion, which surfaces
briefly during his gym play with retarded adults. With his snarl,
his acne, and his drug perscriptions, Morgan is the character
you're least likely to find on TV's countless fictional teen
dramas.

WILLIAM MAXWELL: WRITER-EDITOR OF ELEGANT SENSIBILITY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MARK FEENEY  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   William Maxwell, one of America's most esteemed novelists and
short-story writers and for 40 years a fiction editor at The New
Yorker magazine, died Monday at his New York City home. He was 91.
</P>
<P>
   The New Yorker's editor, David Remnick, paid tribute to Mr.
Maxwell Tuesday. ``William Maxwell's prose was deceptively simple,
made of the deepest American feeling. His editorial judgment and
sympathy was also a thing of great beauty and it helped create the
best of The New Yorker.''
</P>
<P>
   Among the writers Mr. Maxwell edited at The New Yorker were
Vladimir Nabokov, Eudora Welty, Isaac Bashevis Singer, John Updike,
John O'Hara, J. D. Salinger, John Cheever, and Harold Brodkey, the
last two of whom were among the many authors to dedicate books to
Mr. Maxwell.
</P>
<P>
   Mr. Maxwell's own writing _ fastidious, unemphatic, carefully
observed _ long ago earned him a place alongside such celebrated
names. He published six novels, three short-story collections, a
memoir, a collection of essays, and a children's book. His 1980
novel, ``So Long, See You Tomorrow,'' won an American Book Award.
He was a member of the American Academy of Arts and Letters and a
winner of the academy's William Dean Howells Medal. He was also a
recipient of the Brandeis Creative Arts Medal.
</P>
<P>
   Mr. Maxwell's fiction was rooted in, though not restricted to,
his Midwestern upbringing. The son of an insurance executive and a
housewife, he was born in the small Illinois town of Lincoln on
Aug. 16, 1908. In his fiction, Lincoln was ``Logan'' or
``Draperville,'' a place of brick-paved streets shaded by elms. He
spent his first 14 years there, later living in Bloomington, Ill.,
and Chicago.
</P>
<P>
   He graduated from the University of Illinois, earned a master's
degree at Harvard, then returned to Illinois to teach. He published
his first novel, ``Bright Center of Heaven,'' in 1934 and financed
a move to New York with the $200 advance for his second novel. The
New Yorker hired him to work in its art department, and he soon
began to edit fiction.
</P>
<P>
   A slender, fine-featured man, Mr. Maxwell had the look of a
literary cleric. He had the manner as well: civilized, circumspect,
sympathetic. ``As a writer,'' Mr. Maxwell once said, ``I don't very
much enjoy being edited. As an editor I tried to work so slightly
on the manuscript that 10 years later the writer would read his
story and not be aware that anybody was involved but him.''
</P>
<P>
   Unlike many writers who have supported themselves editing, Mr.
Maxwell found working on others' prose helped improve his own. ``I
came, as a result of being an editor, to look for whatever was
unnecessary in my own writing,'' he once recalled. ``After 40
years, what I came to care about most was not style, but the breath
of life.''
</P>
<P>
   Whether as reader, writer, or editor, Mr. Maxwell found his
greatest satisfaction, as he once put it, in ``the forward movement
of prose that is bent only on saying what the writer has to say.''
</P>
<P>
   Mr. Maxwell's wife, Emily Gilman (Noyes) Maxwell, died on July
23. They had been married 55 years. Mr. Maxwell leaves two
daughters, Katharine and Emily, both of New York; a grandson; and a
brother, Robert, of Oxnard, Calif.

AN ACCOUNT OF LIVES LOST IN SERVICE FOR THE CIA

 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
THE BOOK OF HONOR 
Covert Lives and Classified Deaths at the CIA 
By Ted Gup 
Doubleday, 390 pp., illustrated, $25.95 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   On the north wall of the large lobby of the Central Intelligence
Agency headquarters in Langley, Va., is a field of black stars
chiseled into the white Vermont marble. Above the five rows are
engraved the words: ``In honor of those members of the Central
Intelligence Agency who gave their lives in the service of their
country.''
</P>
<P>
   After five decades of CIA operation, more than 70 stars line the
wall. But the lives _ and deaths _ represented by more than half of
those stars have remained secret. Until now. Ted Gup's accomplished
reporting in The Washington Post, Time magazine, and now this book
provides details of the exploits of about a dozen of the agency's
covert agents. Among those honored:
</P>
<P>
   --Douglas S. Mackiernan, a Stoughton native who became a CIA
intelligence officer in western China, only to get stuck at his
post (ostensibly, he was a vice consul) at the time of the
communist takeover in 1949. Mackiernan sought to escape by trekking
across the Himalayas to Tibet in winter. Three months later, within
sight of the border, Mackiernan and two anticommunist Russians who
were accompanying him were shot to death by Tibetan guards who
likely mistook them for bandits rustling sheep.
</P>
<P>
   --Thomas Ray, a member of the Alabama National Guard who
volunteered for the CIA operation helping train Cuban exiles to fly
the planes that were to provide air support for the Bay of Pigs
invasion in 1961. Although President Kennedy had decided at the
last minute to minimize the actual involvement of US military in
the invasion, Ray and a colleague were allowed to fly a B-26 from
their Nicaraguan training base to Cuba to aid the landing. Their
plane was shot out of the sky; though Ray survived the crash, he
was subsequently killed in a firefight with Castro's militiamen.
</P>
<P>
   --Lawrence N. Freedman, a rough kid out of Philadelphia who
became a member of the elite military Delta Force (often assigned
to CIA missions) after earning two Bronze Medals and a chestful of
other awards with the Special Forces in Vietnam. Although he
survived the disastrous attempt to rescue the 81 Americans held
hostage at the US Embassy in Tehran in 1980, Freedman's luck ran
out several foreign operations later, in 1992, in Somalia. By then
he was with the CIA, and was one of the first Americans to arrive
in the African nation on the failed mission of pacifying it in
support of relief efforts. Freedman was killed as the jeep he drove
hit a land mine.
</P>
<P>
   The stories that Gup reveals are not confined to covert
derring-do. What motivated these men and women to join the agency,
particularly knowing the rigors of the job and the strain that it
placed on their families, is also explored _ mostly through rich
reporting that Gup did with those who were left behind: the
spouses, parents, sons, and daughters of the agents.
</P>
<P>
   In many instances, these families were unaware of their loved
ones' exploits until long after their deaths. The CIA, maintaining
its position of never revealing ``sources or methods'' of its
operations (particularly the most dangerous ones, in hostile
foreign countries), customarily arranged to have either the State
Department or the Pentagon claim the deceased agent as its own.
</P>
<P>
   On the surface, it is difficult to understand why the CIA would
have gone along with Gup's project. Even though he does not admit
that the CIA assisted him, it seems likely (judging from the
documents he quotes and the access he received) that the top
echelon of the agency, particularly director George Tenet, believed
there was good reason for Gup's book to be written.
</P>
<P>
   Why? Possibly because with the end of the Cold War, the danger
of having the Soviet Union use the information for propaganda
advantage has passed, and the time is overdue for the heroics of
these individuals to be told. It may also have occurred to the
CIA's leaders that the agency _ whose history has been replete with
embarrassing disclosures, from wrongheaded operations to fumbled
opportunities to double-dealing spies _ can only benefit if more
people know about the valiant dedication of its best operatives.
</P>
<P>
   Gup does not go overboard; his praise goes mostly to
individuals. These agents were brave, resourceful, and patriotic;
the agency they worked for often let them down. Consider John
Merriman, who was badly injured in a plane crash in the Congo in
1964 while participating in a CIA mission there. Because the US
Embassy was contending that no Americans were involved in the
operation, Merriman was forced to remain in country, denied
adequate hospitalization for more than a month. He died on the
flight home _ and his family was told he had died in a car accident
in Puerto Rico.
</P>
<P>
   Or consider Hugh Redmond, captured in Shanghai in 1951 and
imprisoned as a CIA spy. He was 31 when he was arrested. He
remained in Chinese prisons until his death in 1970, even though it
is likely that an acknowledgment by the US government that he had
been an intelligence agent would have procured his freedom. But
such an admission, Gup implies, would have embarrassed the CIA,
which was intent on maintaining covert operations at whatever costs
were necessary.
</P>
<P>
   Gup's book is a fitting tribute to the people who actually paid
those costs.

PATRIOTS GET OFF ON THE RIGHT FOOT 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By RON BORGES

<P>
   CANTON, Ohio _ A sentence can now be written that has not been
written in New England in years. The Patriots ran the football.
</P>
<P>
   Monday being the opening game of the exhibition season against
what seems destined to be one of the worst teams in the NFC, that
fact may prove to be meaningless a month from now. But, for at
least a few days, it at least can be honestly stated.
</P>
<P>
   The Patriots ran the football against an NFL opponent. Ran it,
and ran it, and ran it again. Ran it down the throats of the San
Francisco 49ers.
</P>
<P>
   Admittedly, it was against a lousy defense made worse by the
absence of six of the starting front seven plus the expected
starting strong safety. But when you have not averaged 4 yards a
carry in a season since 1985, to rush for 193 yards in 38 carries
and average 5.1 yards against anyone is cause for elation, even if
only until Friday night, when the Patriots will try to do it again
against a considerably more formidable Detroit Lions team.
</P>
<P>
   What is significant from New England's point of view is that it
ran for those yards without three likely offensive line starters
(Bruce Armstrong, Grant Williams, and Todd Rucci) and without
rookie running back J.R. Redmond, all of whom were nursing
injuries.
</P>
<P>
   So what we know is this: A lineup of backup 49ers massed at the
line of scrimmage couldn't prevent a line of 60 percent Patriot
backups from knocking them on their backsides often enough to allow
Raymont Harris to run for 58 yards in the first half on nine
carries, an average of 6.4 yards per rush.
</P>
<P>
   What this tells us is subject to debate, but it is still summer,
and no time yet for pessimism or debating. There will be time
enough for that later. Like Saturday morning, perhaps, if the Lions
stuff the Patriots. Although there are ample reasons to find
Monday's numbers suspect, the fact is the Bill Belichick Era opened
with a 20-0 victory _ the first time a Patriot team had shut out
its first preseason opponent _ and it was accomplished in large
measure by running the football.
</P>
<P>
   For the moment, at least, it is enough just to say that.
</P>
<P>
   New offensive coordinator Charlie Weis called 38 running plays,
a figure the Patriots topped only twice last season. What this
shows, it would seem, is a sense of purpose. This year, unlike
recent seasons, the ball will be run because that is what Weis and
Belichick believe must be done. That being the case, there was no
time like the present to give it a try.
</P>
<P>
   ``What I liked was that our backs ran hard,'' Belichick said.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed they did, and no one ran harder than Harris, who did not
play last season because of a broken leg and had not played in an
NFL game since Nov. 15, 1998, when he carried 10 times for 33 yards
with the Green Bay Packers. That should mean he's well rested, and
he looked it, although he is still a far cry from the back who
rushed for 1,033 yards and 10 touchdowns for the Chicago Bears in
1997.
</P>
<P>
   Those are numbers Harris believes he can put together again now
that he is fully healthy, but there are many skeptics when he
mentions such a thing because his career has been littered with
litters used to carry him off the field. Still, Monday night he ran
with abandon through the makeshift 49er defense, showing
acceleration, power, a willingness to plow over people, and enough
speed into the holes not to always have to do that.
</P>
<P>
   Forget the idea that Harris is going to average 6.4 yards a
carry or that the Patriots are going to have the kind of running
game that averages 5.1 yards a rush with regularity.
</P>
<P>
   But take heart in this. What happened Monday night is at least a
start toward giving quarterback Drew Bledsoe the kind of balanced
attack he hasn't had since it was decided by some genius that a guy
named Curtis Martin could be easily replaced. That was four years
ago, and Martin hasn't been replaced, and neither Raymont Harris
nor J.R. Redmond is likely to do it either.
</P>
<P>
   Still, on Monday night the Patriots ran the ball.
</P>
<P>
   For now, it is enough just to be able to write such a sentence.

&HT;     RESEARCH BABOONS RETIRE TO FIVE-ACRE SANCTUARY 
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 &HT;     By LETY LAUREL  
 &HT;     c.2000 San Antonio Express-News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   DILLEY, Texas _ For 10 years they lived in a cold, windowless
laboratory, endured needle pokes twice a day and watched television
for their entertainment. Now, eight former research baboons are
free to co-exist with coyotes, rattlesnakes and rabbits and roam
among mesquite trees and cactuses near Dilley, Texas.
</P>
<P>
   It took a few hours, but by mid-afternoon Friday, all of the
male research baboons, along with one female baboon whose former
owner went to prison, were roaming in a five-acre enclosure at the
Animal Protection Institute's Texas Snow Monkey Sanctuary.
</P>
<P>
   Normally euthanized after their research duties end, or placed
in small cages until they die, these are believed to be the first
research baboons to be released into a free-ranging enclosure in
the United States.
</P>
<P>
   ``We feel these guys worked for us in their laboratory for 10
years,'' said Lou Griffin, director of the sanctuary. ``They were
taken from their families in Africa so they could be used for
research. We think it's only fair to let them live out the rest of
their lives in a comfortable fashion, not just a cage.''
</P>
<P>
   The male baboons were used in vascular research at the Boston
University Medical Center. They were brought to the sanctuary in
April for rehabilitation. Of the original nine given to the
sanctuary, eight survived. One was euthanized Thursday because of a
brain tumor.
</P>
<P>
   The only female, Nikki, was once featured in parades, but she
was brought to the sanctuary after biting several people and after
her owner was convicted of contract murder.
</P>
<P>
   The sanctuary received $20,000 from Boston University Medical
Center to build the five-acre enclosure for the baboons.
</P>
<P>
   ``Previous to this, when people were done with the animals,
there was not a place like this to send them so we were forced to
put them to sleep. But now that there is a facility like this, it's
nice because they have an option,'' said Kathy Brasky, a
veterinarian with the Southwest Foundation for Biomedical Research.
</P>
<P>
   Since April, the former research baboons have slowly adjusted to
being outside, but they are extremely vulnerable to nature after 10
years of living in air-conditioned cages, Griffin said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Once these first 24 hours are under our belt, I will know
things will be okay,'' she said. ``The one thing we couldn't teach
them was to avoid rattlesnakes.''
</P>
<P>
   From snakes and falling tree branches to their own aggression
against each other, the baboons will encounter numerous challenges.
</P>
<P>
   ``We'll see if they can handle the heat,'' she said. ``They have
been exposed to cactus, but they still have a lot of thorny lessons
to learn.''
</P>
<P>
   Using caramel cubes, peanuts, cereal, orange slices and finally
water, the baboons were coaxed from their cages through a wire
tunnel that opened into the enclosure.
</P>
<P>
   Minutes turned to hours before the baboons grudgingly entered
their new home.
</P>
<P>
   But after the first tentative steps, they were soon climbing
trees, eating hay and chasing each other in the dirt.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm almost moved to tears,'' said Howard Klein, an API board
member from Sacramento. ``After being confined in a cage almost the
size of a postage stamp, look at them bouncing in the trees.
Amazing.''
</P>
<P>
   Inside the enclosure, Griffin sat in her truck, observing the
baboons and noting their behavior.
</P>
<P>
   ``Since they're wild-caught, we're hoping they will form normal
social troops and turn back into baboons,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Because of their fur and weight, the animals are currently in
good condition, Brasky said. In the following weeks, keepers will
monitor the animals' activity levels and interactions to ensure
they are adapting well.
</P>
<P>
   ``They will probably fight, because that is the nature of their
society,'' Brasky said. ``There must be a dominant male, so they
may fight until they figure out which one it will be, but it
probably won't be that bad.''
</P>
<P>
   But with summer temperatures reaching above 100, they may crave
their old air-conditioned labs and the TV, Griffin said.
</P>
<P>
   ``So far they don't seem to miss TV, but when they are out here,
they have the coyotes and birds to keep them busy,'' she said.

&HT;     TIPS TO ELIMINATE WHITE LIES IN THE WORKPLACE 
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 &HT;     By DAVE MURPHY  
 &HT;     c.2000 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   (Undated) _ How's this for a job interview question: When is the
last time you lied about work?
</P>
<P>
   If you said, ``never,'' you're probably lying _ maybe even to
yourself. Or maybe you're tempted to use an answer that would make
President Clinton proud: It depends on what your definition of
``lied'' is.
</P>
<P>
   We're being purists here, so when is the last time you
deliberately misled someone about a work-related subject? If you
still say ``never,'' here are a few follow-up questions: Ever call
in sick when you weren't? Or tell your boss that you liked his idea
when you really didn't? Or say you had almost finished a project
when in reality you had barely started it? Or say you were too busy
to do something when you really weren't? Or tell employees or
shareholders that things were better than they were?
</P>
<P>
   If you still consider yourself pure, let's try a few more: Ever
exaggerate on your resume? Or say you were enthused about a company
when in reality you were so desperate that you would have taken a
job as Attila the Hun's administrative assistant? Or say that you
were leaving to pursue more challenging work, when you really just
wanted to escape a nasty and incompetent boss? Did you tell the
truth when a prospective employer asked, ``What's your biggest
weakness?''
</P>
<P>
   Don't worry. None of this will be on the final exam. No
interviewer will ask such a blunt question about lying unless you
are already dead meat, and the interviewer simply wants to bat you
around in his paws like a cat with a mouse.
</P>
<P>
   Otherwise, the interview will be the same dance it always is,
with the interviewer saying how the company is always looking for
wonderful applicants, and you saying how much you admire the
company. Remember: Even if every tobacco company on Earth goes out
of business, Corporate America will still be addicted to blowing
smoke.
</P>
<P>
   Sorry to say it, but in much of the American workplace, there is
a corporate culture of lying. And it seems to be getting worse.
</P>
<P>
   All the layoffs of the last 15 years have eroded the trust and
respect between employers and employees. And just as parents tell
their young children when they catch them in a white lie, people
can get into the habit of lying. Once they do, it's a hard habit to
break.
</P>
<P>
   If you're an employer and you value honesty (and you're not
lying about it), here are some steps you can take:
</P>
<P>
   _ Stop with the euphemisms already.
</P>
<P>
   People don't get downsized, rightsized or outsourced. They get
fired. It's a traumatic experience, and trying to downplay it with
a buzzword is like trying to put out a fire with fertilizer.
</P>
<P>
   I can hear you talking to your children now, telling them the
old story about George Washington and his father: ``I cannot tell a
lie. I rightsized that cherry tree.''
</P>
<P>
   If you can't bring yourself to say that you fired 200 people,
maybe it's time to let your conscience do a little talking.
</P>
<P>
   _ Hire honest people.
</P>
<P>
   If you develop a reputation for thoroughly checking applicants'
backgrounds and refusing to hire those who lie, it will set the
tone for the rest of your workplace. On the other hand, if
employees learn from Day One that they can get away with lying to
you, it will set a different tone.
</P>
<P>
   Before you check their backgrounds, ask candidates if there are
any surprises you will find. That provides the chance for the
honest ones to give their side of the story if a problem occurred.
</P>
<P>
   If you ask an applicant, ``What's your biggest weakness?'' and
you get some canned answer like ``sometimes I just push myself too
hard,'' follow it up with, ``What's your second biggest weakness?''
Keep going like this until you get to the 23rd biggest weakness _
or an answer with at least a grain of honesty.
</P>
<P>
   After he won the British Open last weekend, Tiger Woods said he
still has weaknesses in his golf game. Keeping that in mind, look
across the table at Mr. or Ms. ``Sometimes I Just Push Myself Too
Hard.'' Are those people better at their jobs than Tiger Woods is
at his?
</P>
<P>
   Not bloody likely.
</P>
<P>
   Good workers know they have weaknesses. They either work hard to
overcome them or work smart to get around them. People who say they
have no significant weaknesses are either lying or oblivious.
</P>
<P>
   _ Encourage honest feedback.
</P>
<P>
   Act on employee suggestions whenever you can. A lot of bosses
say they love to empower (see euphemisms, stop with them already)
workers, but that tends to be done with the lips instead of the
heart. Do you really listen to employees, or do you just say that
you listen to employees (see lying, through your teeth)?
</P>
<P>
   Where is the suggestion box at your company? Next to a corner
office or right above the trash can?
</P>
<P>
   _ Eliminate sick days.
</P>
<P>
   No, don't reduce the number of days off, but label days off as
personal days rather than sick days or vacation days. Sometimes
people are so desperate for a day or two off that they will call in
sick even if they're perfectly healthy. That can lead to resentment
among your equally-tired-but-honest workers.
</P>
<P>
   If people need a personal day, let them take it without having
to lie. It actually works to your advantage, not just because it
rewards honesty, but because they may be able to give you warning
in advance of the personal days off. You always get last-minute
notice with ``sick'' days.
</P>
<P>
   White lies are always going to be a part of the workplace, just
as they're a part of everyday life. But at least you can make them
a little less casual. If someone asks, ``When is the last time you
lied about work?'' you ought to give your answer by checking your
calendar, not your watch.

A LOOK AT TV'S FIRST CONVENTION; SPECTATOR ADRIFT 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MARK JURKOWITZ  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   For those turned off and tuned out in this era of meticulously
scripted political conventions, the Aug. 7 issue of US News &AMP; World
Report offers some stirring nostalgia. Senior writer Roger Simon
has produced an engaging history of the 1948 Philadelphia
conventions, the first party gatherings invaded by the glare of
live TV cameras.
</P>
<P>
   That year, genuine convention tension abounded. Republican
nominee Thomas Dewey beat Harold Stassen after three ballots and
Democratic Senator Alben Barkley earned a surprise vice
presidential nod from Harry Truman after delivering a stirring
68-minute speech from memory.
</P>
<P>
   TV was young and innocent in those days. Instead of blowing off
the conventions for prime-time fare, NBC pre-empted its new
``Texaco Star Theatre,'' starring Milton Berle. And Time magazine
opined that the ``telecameras'' actually made the convention
rituals seem ``bigger and more exciting than they actually were.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, some pols quickly mastered the new medium. Truman
selected a telegenic white suit, white shirt, and black tie that
the New York Times described as ``the best masculine garb for the
video cameras.'' To demonstrate the high price of food, one speaker
brandished a ``dripping raw steak'' for the cameras.
</P>
<P>
   By 1952, as Simon notes, CBS had opened a school teaching pols
how to behave on TV and as quickly as it had started, the era of
convention spontaneity began drawing to a close.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
----- &QC; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   As Republicans gather in Philadelphia determined to end the
Clinton-Gore era, it's worth checking out the magazine that
launched the conservative media campaign against the president.
</P>
<P>
   Long before conservatism was synonymous with compassion, The
American Spectator was probably, along with Rush Limbaugh, the most
influential conservative media force of the early '90s. Its
signature piece was a 1993 ``Troopergate'' story alleging that
state troopers procured women for then-governor William Clinton and
introducing America to a mysterious ``Paula.'' (Today, better known
as Paula Jones.)
</P>
<P>
   But times have changed. In a 1998 Esquire article,
``Troopergate'' author David Brock apologized to Clinton for
rummaging around in his personal life. Colin Powell is now
lecturing GOP delegates on the merits of affirmative action. And
the Spectator, whose circulation is down from over 200,000 to
roughly 110,000, seems to have lost altitude.
</P>
<P>
   The magazine's July/August cover story on ``Bill's Kids'' tries
to work itself into a lather over the politicization of AmeriCorps,
Clinton's national service program that ``operates more like a
federal relief program for nightclub comics.'' The Spectator makes
the case that the program _ with a budget of about a half billion
dollars _ is little more than a Democratic scam, recruiting
families to get subsidized health insurance, steering folks to the
welfare office, and working to organize the gay community.
</P>
<P>
   ``If AmeriCorps helped at a barn-raising, members would later
claim not just to have helped someone build a barn _ but swear they
also redeemed the person's self-esteem, gave him a purpose in life,
and introduced him to multiculturalism and diversity,'' writes
author James Bovard.
</P>
<P>
   It's a good line. But a piece whacking AmeriCorps suggests that
after eight years, the conservative press is finally running out of
Clinton ammo. It's time for a new administration.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
----- &QC; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The double July 31 issue of Sports Illustrated devotes 74 pages
to an irresistible ``Where Are They Now?'' feature tracking down
some of sports's former bit characters.
</P>
<P>
   These days transgendered tennis star Renee Richards, 65, is a
successful Park Avenue pediatric ophthalmologist. The two
17-year-old chuckleheads who ran onto the field to brazenly accost
Henry Aaron after he broke Babe Ruth's home run record in 1974 are
mildly repentant 44-year-olds. (They did spend a few hours in jail
that night for their antics.) Of local interest are the fates of
two former Red Sox flakes from the '70s. Outfielder Bernie Carbo
has found religion and runs the Diamond Club Ministry in Mobile,
Ala. And ``Spaceman'' Bill Lee is a Vermont farmer who happily
describes himself as a ``Rastafarian-Buddhist-Communist-Roman
Catholic.''
</P>
<P>
   Atlanta Braves reliever John Rocker, whose bigoted outburst in
Sports Illustrated sent his life into a downward spiral, is the
cover boy for the Aug. 7 issue of ESPN, The Magazine.
</P>
<P>
   The difference between the two sports magazines is largely
generational, roughly the equivalent of the Beatles versus
Metallica. Sports Illustrated, for the boomers, is literate and
leisurely. ESPN, for the X-ers, is jangly and visually jarring.
</P>
<P>
   I'll betray my age by choosing Sports Illustrated writing over
this ESPN passage any day: ``Twitching and spasming, a convulsion
in cleats, Rocker runs full throttle toward center stage, scorching
the earth en route, a lit fuse looking for a place to explode.''
</P>
<P>
   Give Rocker credit for learning one thing, however. He declined
to be interviewed for his own cover story.

&HT;      WESTER-KRIEG AGES GRACEFULLY IN HER ELEMENT 
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 &HT;     By DWIGHT CHAPIN  
 &HT;     c.2000 San Francisco Examiner

<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ In 1992, Angie Wester-Krieg was described as
``the Grande Dame of U.S. Swimming.''
</P>
<P>
   It's hard to say what that makes her now.
</P>
<P>
   At 35, Wester-Krieg is still swimming. Very well, in fact. She
has qualified for her sixth U.S. Olympic trials, which is a record
as far as USA Swimming officials can determine.
</P>
<P>
   She certainly will be one of the oldest competitors in
Indianapolis next week _ if not the oldest.
</P>
<P>
   But that's not a big deal to her, so it probably shouldn't be to
anyone else.
</P>
<P>
   Wester-Krieg is the Energizer bunny of swimmers. Unlike some of
her contemporaries _ notably Dara Torres, who took seven years off
from the sport before returning to the pool recently for one more
try at Olympic glory _ she has never dried off.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've just kept right on swimming,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   This has required a number of adjustments, not to mention
several understanding people in her life.
</P>
<P>
   Most notably, those include her bosses at Ernst and Young, for
whom she has long worked as a tax accountant based in San Jose, and
her husband, Santa Clara Swim Club coach Peter Krieg.
</P>
<P>
   ``I look on my employer as a big part of the reason I've been
able to continue swimming, because it has allowed me to work
part-time for almost 14 years, to accommodate my training,'' she
said.
</P>
<P>
   And husband Peter, she added, ``has never pushed me, never said
I should do this or that. He has kind of let me do my own thing and
make decisions for myself. He has always made me feel very
supported.''
</P>
<P>
   Wester-Krieg is the youngest of four children of Ernest and
Margaret Wester, who came to Cupertino from Austria in 1955, after
discovering California through a copy of Reader's Digest. Ernest
became a butler and Margaret a cook on an apricot ranch.
</P>
<P>
   Angie started swimming when she was 7 and did well early, but
didn't really break through until she went to San Jose State, where
she became a six-time All-America under coach Jack Mutimer and
consistently finished high in the 100 and 200 butterfly at the NCAA
championships.
</P>
<P>
   But a pattern developed. She had a lot of trouble winning the
big prizes. After her third unsuccessful bid to make the U.S.
Olympic team, in 1988, Mutimer told her he thought she should
retire and get on with her life.
</P>
<P>
   She stuck with it, however, and began working under Krieg, who
became her coach and then her husband. In 1990, she swam just off
her lifetime best at the U.S. nationals, and she and Peter decided
she should ``go with the best,'' Stanford and Olympic coach Richard
Quick.
</P>
<P>
   And with Quick's guidance, she finally became an Olympian in
1992, finishing second behind Summer Sanders in the 200 butterfly
at the U.S. trials.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'll never forget what she told me before that race,'' Quick
recalled. ``She said, `Richard, I don't know whether I'll get first
or last tonight, but I know I'm going to swim a great race.' That's
an approach that lets the best come out in you.''
</P>
<P>
   Wester-Krieg didn't medal in Barcelona, but she did keep going.
And going. Into the 1996 trials and now into the 2000 trials, where
she will compete in the 100- and 200-meter butterfly events.
</P>
<P>
   ``I feel very similar to the way I felt in 1992,'' she said.
``Your goals and aspirations don't change that much. I don't know _
I can't know _ how I'll compare with the other swimmers at the
trials, but I'm confident I can swim well.''
</P>
<P>
   Quick said, ``She's going to have to swim the best race of her
life to make the team. What I think she's hoping to do is put
herself into a position where if the door is open for her to make
the team, she won't slam it on herself, she'll go through it.''
</P>
<P>
   Quick added that Wester-Krieg ``has been a joy to coach because
she enjoys training and racing so much. It's pretty extraordinary
for someone to be swimming at that high level for that period of
time. I think she's been able to do it because she enjoys the sport
so much.''
</P>
<P>
   Wester-Krieg said there has never been any grand plan behind her
longevity.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not like when I was a teenager, I said to myself, `I'll
still be swimming competitively 20 years from now,' `' Wester-Krieg
said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Swimming is a learning process, like everything in life. This
is just the arena I've chosen to live and grow in.''
</P>
<P>
   Wester-Krieg said she faces a lot more job and life demands that
she once did, more than most of her training partners with the
Stanford Swim Club.
</P>
<P>
   ``Most of the Stanford girls are on break from their schooling
right now,'' she said. ``After the morning workouts, they'll say,
`I can't wait to take my morning nap.' I just look at them and
think, `I wish ' `'
</P>
<P>
   Wester-Krieg never focuses on the age difference.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think about what they have versus what I don't have,''
she said, ``or about what I have that they don't have. I'm sure
it's a mixed bag for them. Some admire me, some wonder why I don't
give it up. But no one is able to understand why another person
does something. If anyone enjoyed this sport as much as I do, they
might stay in it as long as I have.''
</P>
<P>
   Wester-Krieg's competitive career likely will end in
Indianapolis, or _ if she's lucky _ in Sydney.
</P>
<P>
   She and Peter have talked of having children, and she said, ``We
want to have time for ourselves, too. It's time to move on.''
</P>
<P>
   But, one way or another, Wester-Krieg figures she'll be involved
in swimming as long as she's on the planet.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just really, truly love the sport,'' she said. ``I don't see
myself as a coach, necessarily. It probably will become more of a
here-and-there type of thing. And I'll be able to live it
vicariously, through my husband.''
</P>
<P>
   If Peter has his way, however, Angie will not wind up merely a
vicarious swimmer.
</P>
<P>
   ``He likes me to come to his practices,'' she said. ``He makes
me race his kids.''

SENATE CANDIDATE FACES RIDICULE, BUT GETS ON TALK SHOWS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JOANNA WEISS  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHILADELPHIA _ Want to talk to the man who's running against Ted
Kennedy?
</P>
<P>
   That's the pitch Jack E. Robinson's press secretary was making
this week, shopping his candidate around to the local and national
radio talk show hosts. And it was working. A lot of these people
love to hate Senator Edward M. Kennedy, and they've got ample air
time to fill. New York gabber Sean Hannity asked to shake
Robinson's hand, and then agreed to put him on the air. A crew from
a Texas station set up an interview in minutes.
</P>
<P>
   But getting attention is easier than getting respect, as
Robinson learned from his 15 minutes with syndicated radio host
Armstrong Williams. The black conservative tried to give Robinson a
dose of harsh reality, scoffing at his belief that Kennedy would
debate him and howling at his refusal to ask Republican bigwigs for
money or endorsements.
</P>
<P>
   ``Brother, I'm trying to help you,'' Williams said. ``You don't
realize how badly you need help. But you're not willing to ask
these people. What's wrong with you?''
</P>
<P>
   Robinson took the drubbing in stride, but then, he's no stranger
to harsh truths. Ever since embarrassing facts about his personal
life emerged in the spring _ and the state GOP abruptly withdrew
its support _ Robinson has been waging an uphill fight for
legitimacy.
</P>
<P>
   Things seemed to be turning his way this summer, when the courts
blessed his efforts to get on the ballot. And with a hefty donation
to the National Republican Senatorial Committee _ Robinson says it
was $3,000 _ he won a pass to the convention, and with it a chance
to schmooze with potential donors from across the nation.
</P>
<P>
   But so far, it has been a week of mixed blessings: a national
radio appearance, but no softball questions; a connection to the
Massachusetts contingent in Philadelphia, but no easy access to
state delegation events; an impromptu tete-a-tete with Governor
Paul Cellucci of Massachusetts, but no endorsement.
</P>
<P>
   And a skeptical media horde that, at times, seems to want to
help Robinson behave more like a candidate. A news conference
Tuesday deteriorated into an awkward back-and-forth as reporters
asked Robinson to address the contention that endorsements might
actually help his cause.
</P>
<P>
   For all of his difficulties, though, Robinson has been carrying
himself as someone with big prospects. He says Kennedy is afraid of
him. He vows he'll raise $7 million in the next 90 days.
</P>
<P>
   But he also insists that he won't ask any GOP leaders for money
or endorsements: ``I don't like the idea of going hat in hand to
anybody but the voters.'' Instead, he plans to seek donations by
repeating his Web address on every radio and TV show he can.
</P>
<P>
   So far, Robinson says, he has raised about $20,000, in the week
he has been actively seeking money. His press secretary, Tom
McCuin, said most of it has come from out-of-state Republicans,
such as the two Arkansas men who handed him $20 apiece the other
night and promised to send more.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just tend to believe that most of the money is going to come
from the hard-core Republicans across America,'' he said. ``To
them, Ted Kennedy is one of the last living monoliths of liberalism
that they would love to see out of the Senate.''
</P>
<P>
   Support from within Massachusetts so far has been an iffier
proposition. At a party on Sunday, one delegate shook Robinson's
hand politely, but rolled his eyes when the candidate was out of
sight.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's unfortunate, because he seems like a nice guy,'' said the
delegate, who asked not to be identified. He said he had declined
to sign Robinson's nominating papers lest he encourage Robinson to
squander his own wealth on the campaign. ``Why throw money down a
rat hole?'' the delegate said.
</P>
<P>
   Still, Robinson's perseverance, and his very presence in
Philadelphia, have earned him accolades.
</P>
<P>
   Massachusetts delegate Steve Leahy, who noted that he hopes to
volunteer for Robinson's campaign, said the candidate has ``that
kind of fortitude and that kind of background, always sending out a
positive message. I respect the man.''
</P>
<P>
   If only Robinson could get such praise from the governor. But
Cellucci talks about the candidate the way he might a wayward
child. ``He's doing OK; the guy got on the ballot,'' Cellucci said
earlier this week. ``It's good sport for him to be in.''
</P>
<P>
   Cellucci took the same approach when he wound up face-to-face
with Robinson Tuesday morning. A crush of reporters demanded to
know whether Cellucci would give an endorsement. The governor
smiled.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's got this persona of being independent,'' Cellucci said.
''It's helping him a lot. So I don't want to mess things up for
him.''

FOR FUTURE RETIREE, FIXED INCOME IS THE GOAL 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By KENNETH HOOKER  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR; Q. I plan to retire at 55; I will need $2,600 a month. Am I on
track to retire on schedule?
</P>
<P>
   J.V., Beaumont, Texas &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A. I see no problem. If your returns average 9 percent over the
next six years, and if you continue saving at your current rate,
you would accumulate $389,029. Why assume 9 percent, especially
since the funds you have been using have been producing
double-digit returns? Because now is the time to begin adjusting
your savings, moving toward more conservative investments as you
approach retirement.
</P>
<P>
   At retirement, you will need a $1,600 a month to supplement your
pension. Let's suppose you will be able to earn 7 percent from a
fixed-income portfolio _ perhaps bond funds, perhaps CDs, or a mix.
To get $1,600 monthly, you would need $275,000 in your fixed-income
account, leaving you with a little more than $114,000 that you
could leave in the various stock funds, designed for the capital
growth you will need later in retirement.
</P>
<P>
   The goal is to begin building that fixed-income account so it
will be in place by the time you retire. I'd stop contributing to
the stock funds and put both the 401(k) contributions and your
additions to your mutual fund accounts into a good fixed-income
portfolio. I don't know what specific funds are available with your
401(k), but a good Vanguard fixed-income portfolio might consist of
50 percent Vanguard GNMA and 25 percent each in Vanguard High-Yield
Corporate Bond and Vanguard Short-Term Corporate Bond.
</P>
<P>
   For this year, switching ongoing savings to the fixed-income
side should be enough, but in subsequent years you should slowly
begin moving some of the money from the stock funds to the
fixed-income side.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. I plan to give my grandchildren $10,000 each. No further
contributions will follow. What type of investment would you
recommend for maximum long-term growth?
</P>
<P>
   D.B., Charleston, S.C. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A. The investment you choose will probably reflect your appetite
for risk. The old adage in my family: The gift must please the
giver.
</P>
<P>
   One investment vehicle that comes to mind is a mutual fund for
children _ designed to provide both long-term growth and to teach
them about investing. This is the Stein Roe Young Investors fund,
which invests in large-growth stocks its managers deem to be stocks
of companies that affect the lives of children. Clearly, the
managers apply this requirement broadly, since the largest current
holding, according to Morningstar Mutual Funds, is Cisco Systems.
</P>
<P>
   The fund also delivers both the reports traditional investors
are familiar with that are blessed by the SEC and reports written
so children can slowly build an understanding of investing.
</P>
<P>
   Like many growth funds, Stein Roe Young Investors has been
taking its lumps this year, with a 3.56 percent year-to-date loss
as this is written. But its five-year record shows a 22.84 percent
average annual gain, slightly beating the Standard and Poor's 500
</P>
<P>
   Index.
</P>
<P>
   You might want to look carefully at the risk profile. The fund's
portfolio has a price-to-earnings ratio of 47.9, compared to 37.2
for the S&AMP;P 500. In other words, it's assuming more risk than the
S&AMP;P and providing owners very faint reward for assuming that extra
risk. A conservative investor might decide much the same results
are likely with something like Vanguard's Index 500 fund, which
will predictably deliver the S&AMP;P 500 Index results without
additional risk.
</P>
<P>
   One tactic is to invest $9,500 traditionally and put the other
$500 in an education IRA. Each year, you could then suggest $500 be
moved from the taxable accounts into the education IRAs. This
wouldn't solve all the tax problems, but it certainly would help.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. I am 75, and a conservative investor. You have mentioned
Vanguard's Small-Cap Index fund. Vanguard has three small-cap index
funds: Small-Cap Index, Small-Cap Growth Index, and Small-Cap Value
Index. Which is the fund to invest in? Is it wise to invest in
mid-cap and small-cap funds?
</P>
<P>
   M.N., Quincy, Mass. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A. To begin with, the small-cap universe is not the arena of
choice for conservative investors. The companies tend to be untried
and often competing with larger, well-established, and
better-financed companies. But it's also true that a lot of
tomorrow's Oracles and Intels are probably lurking in that universe
today. Thus, I frequently suggest growth-oriented investors might
include both small- and mid-cap funds to represent small segments
of a portfolio, typically 10 percent to 15 percent for each.
</P>
<P>
   Vanguard's small-cap funds provide an easy way to gain exposure
to this segment of the market, but it's far from perfect. Here's
why:
</P>
<P>
   Consider the case of a truly excellent company that blinks into
the small-cap world. What happens if it's a real mover? The stock
market notices it and bids up its shares, and it quickly becomes a
mid-cap stock. At that point, according to its charter, the
Vanguard Small-Cap Index funds sell the stock and the Mid-Cap Index
funds buy it. As the company's success continues, the market cap
continues to grow, and eventually it will join the big fellows. The
holders of the Mid-Cap Index fund will then be sold out of the
stock.
</P>
<P>
   If you have a traditional small-cap fund, the managers can
simply hold onto a fast-growing company, treating it is a small-cap
success story. Thus, if you look at a number of companies that
advertise themselves as small-cap funds, you'll find not only that
the overall portfolio qualifies it as a mid-cap fund, but there
also some large-cap stocks in there, as well.
</P>
<P>
   In short, being obligated to sell off the big winners is an
inherent disadvantage of any small-cap index fund. This may be
offset, in part, by the indexing discipline that requires the
managers to buy everything in their target universe. Doubtless
included are stocks of great value that have not yet been
discovered by the market as a whole. Still, if an investor is
willing to do his or her homework to sort out the many small-cap
funds, I would select a managed small-cap fund over an index fund.
</P>
<P>
   The three Vanguard small-cap funds are roughly modeled after the
relationship between Vanguard's flagship Index 500 fund and its two
offshoots, Index Growth and Index Value. In the case of the
small-cap funds, Vanguard Small-Cap Value breaks out the issues
with the lowest price-to-book value ratio; Small-Cap Growth Index
builds the opposite portfolio, those with the highest price-to-book
ratios. Accordingly, Vanguard's Small-Cap Value fund has a
price-to-book ratio of 2.2, while the Small-Cap fund has a ratio of
6.3, and Small-Cap Growth has a ratio of 8.8.
</P>
<P>
   When I suggest small-cap index funds, I tend to go with the
straight Small-Cap fund, figuring a small-cap value investor is
pretty much an oxymoron (entering a high-risk arena and then
hedging his or her bets), and the small-cap growth arena is just
too rich for my blood. In 1999, the funds performed pretty much as
might be expected, with Small-Cap Growth returning 19.8 percent,
the Small-Cap fund delivering 23.1 percent, and Small-Cap Value
producing a meager 3.4 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Year-to-date, the worm has turned, with the Value fund leading
with a 4.64 percent gain, the growth fund producing a token loss of
0.18 percent, and the Small-Cap fund losing 2.10 percent.

SAN FRANCISCO SHOWS WHAT BALLPARKS CAN DO FOR A CITY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MARTIN F. NOLAN  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR; SAN FRANCISCO _ The location looked dicey: old warehouses,
parking lots, and controversy. A new ballpark was being debated,
and neighborhood opponents reacted as though they smelled an
incinerator or a glue factory.
</P>
<P>
   Stephen Coyle, as he had done before, took a chance. He
committed $72 million in AFL-CIO housing trust money toward
building One Embarcadero South, a 233-unit condominium project
across from what would become Pacific Bell Park, home of the San
Francisco Giants.
</P>
<P>
   In 1996, neighborhood activists _ a mix of old lefties,
Naderites, and other naysayers _ predicted disaster. San
Francisco's nearby parks, roads, and homes ``are citywide assets,
and they will be made useless by the stadium. This housing will be
less desirable now,'' one opponent said.
</P>
<P>
   Last week One Embarcadero South condos went on sale. Prices
start at $700,000 and rise to $2.3 million. Coyle feels vindicated.
``Of the 100 deals the trust has done, this was the most
successful. It brought a return of 41 percent, the best in our
history,'' he says. ``When the ballpark opened, we realized this
was the Carlton Fisk home run.''
</P>
<P>
   Coyle, who guided redevelopment in Boston during the 1980s, says
``Condo return is now better than the return on offices. It was
housing in the '70s, offices in the '80s and now it's condos. We're
working with Mayor Brown on more projects in San Francisco.''
</P>
<P>
   Mayor Willie L. Brown Jr., who heard the prophecies of doom, now
hears nothing. Most San Franciscans admire the ballpark, some
comparing it to Coit Tower, Golden Gate Bridge, and other civic
adornments. ``All of the critics have gone totally silent. They
don't step forward and acknowlege what a positive thing this is,''
Brown says. ``In San Fransisco, NIMBYs have made an art form of the
process of maintaining the current character of their neighborhoods
at the expense of smart growth.''
</P>
<P>
   Cities that do not change calcify and die. Cities that do not
encourage luxury, market-rate housing do not have the tax base to
build affordable housing. Cities that do not offer big, bold plans
pay the price of timidity.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Fenway project needs a serious economic plan,'' Coyle says
of his old hometown. ``It needs a Turnpike ramp to serve the needs
of the future and a land bridge to knit back the city.'' You mean
something like Copley Place or the Pru between Kenmore Square and
Lansdowne Street? ``Exactly,'' Coyle replies. ``This is an economic
engine here. It transforms values upward. You need an economic plan
with infrastructure that works, so the entire community will
benefit, a plan big enough to address all the issues, including
affordable housing.''
</P>
<P>
   Karl Marx is dead. Lenin, too. To build affordable housing,
cities must sponsor unaffordable housing, lots of it.
</P>
<P>
   The AFL-CIO's gamble that towers above Willie Mays Plaza here
``stands for the proposition that ballparks create a new economic
zone where people come 81 days a year, or 90 if they make the
playoffs, to enjoy the game and also restaurants and retail. It
makes other parts of the area work. It adds value in a way not
dissimilar from Faneuil Hall. In the '80s, we talked of catalysts
for development,'' Coyle says. ``This is a catalyst.''
</P>
<P>
   In Boston, he adds, ``What will happen is that the area under
the current Fenway Park will be developed, a 10-acre site for
research or whatever. People will live there and live there
happily. It will create a more exciting environment, and for those
small businesses affected, there will be mitigation.''
</P>
<P>
   When Coyle travels, he sees ``evidence in San Francisco, Denver,
and Cleveland how ballparks bring added value to the urban fabric.
Football stadiums and arenas don't create that livable sense of
excitement.'' When he came here in 1996, his board members were
skeptical, but he told them: ``Forget that across the street it'll
be a ballpark with crowds or whatever. Instead, look at it as a
$400 million investment.''

SOME NURSES, UNHAPPY PROFESSIONALLY, TALK REVOLT 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By ANNE BARNARD  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Besieged by staffing cuts and deteriorating working conditions,
some Massachusetts nurses have decided to update their profession's
mild, nurturing image with a little more radical fire.
</P>
<P>
   They are urging the Massachusetts Nurses Association to split
off from its national parent organization, which they call too
moderate for an era when nursing is, in their words, ``in chaos and
facing extinction.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We need a revolution in health care,'' said Peggy O'Malley,
55, a nurse on disability leave from Brigham and Women's Hospital
in Boston who is campaigning for the split.
</P>
<P>
   Sounding a little less like Florence Nightingale and a bit more
like Karl Marx, leaders of the Massachusetts Nurses Association's
organized labor branch recently proposed the split from the
American Nursing Association. They were emboldened by their
successful April strike at St. Vincent Hospital in Worcester, Mass.
The strike showed nurses that they could score victories by linking
their labor issues to public concern about cost-cutting in health
care.
</P>
<P>
   The proposal has sparked a fierce debate within the
Massachusetts Nurses Association, where some call proponents of
secession ``too militant'' and suggest they are taking out their
frustration over problems that managed care has caused nurses.
</P>
<P>
   The secession movement is building as the American Nursing
Association insists that it has finally embraced a role as a
national labor union _ largely at the prompting of the
Massachusetts group. The MNA, with 18,000 members, makes up
one-tenth of the national association's numbers.
</P>
<P>
   Members of the Massachusetts group will decide the issue in a
Nov. 9 vote that will help shape the future of the organization,
which now operates both as a traditional labor union and as a
professional association for unionized nurses, nurse managers, and
educators. A two-thirds majority is needed for a split; at stake is
the $1 million in annual dues that now goes to the national
association. The Maine Nurses Association is planning a similar
vote.
</P>
<P>
   The argument goes beyond organizational infighting. Nurses are
debating how they view themselves and their profession _ and
particularly, how strongly to identify with organized labor.
</P>
<P>
   ``The image within the ANA is of the nurse as someone who
serves'' the cause of medicine, said Tom Juravich, director of the
University of Massachusetts Labor Center and author of
``Commonwealth of Toil,'' a labor history of the state. Unionized
nurses are more assertive, he said, characterizing their approach
as, ``We don't simply serve; we make our own fortunes.''
</P>
<P>
   But the national organization has changed, said Michelle Nawar,
a spokeswoman for United American Nurses, the ANA union founded
last year. While the national group was long ambivalent, she said,
nowadays even members who do not themselves support unions
recognize that the ANA should lead the way in organizing nurses.
</P>
<P>
   ``The tide is turning,'' she said. ``What we're asking is that
they wait and give the (United American Nurses) a chance.''
</P>
<P>
   Too late, said O'Malley, who is campaigning for the split.
Nurses in Massachusetts, where managed care has hit harder than in
many states, are on the ``front lines'' and ``can't afford to be
moderate,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think doctors are going to lead it, and I don't think
patients are able to lead it,'' she said. ``Nurses are leading it,
and it's nothing less than a revolution. It's a social movement.
And we've gotten much more comfortable with that as nurses.''
</P>
<P>
   Not everyone is comfortable with such unbending language, even
in the generally prolabor Massachusetts group. Meg Perry, 55, a
staff nurse at Cambridge (Mass.) Hospital, opposes the split,
saying union leaders who spend days negotiating contracts should
value compromise.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you have differences within a family, you sit down and
work it out. You don't just pack up your bags,`` Perry said.
</P>
<P>
   The national association has had its problems, including a $3
million deficit last year, but it is doing its best to address
them, Perry said. ANA membership gives Massachusetts nurses more
national clout, as well as access to a professional network, she
added. ``There's a lot to lose that people are not going to be
aware of until they reach for it and it's not there.''
</P>
<P>
   Both the Massachusetts and national groups say they want to
strengthen nurses' unions, increase access to health care, and
maintain staffing levels so that nurses don't have to work
mandatory overtime and patient safety is not compromised.
</P>
<P>
   But the ANA was slower to take those positions, prompting the
California Nurses Association to secede in 1995. The ANA adopted a
resolution against mandatory overtime only in June _ after the St.
Vincent strike in Worcester made national headlines.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps the biggest difference between the Massachusetts and
national groups centers on attitudes toward labor.
</P>
<P>
   The MNA has been unionizing nurses since the 1960s. The ANA,
trying to appeal to union and nonunion states alike, waited until
last year to create its national union. The MNA refused to join it,
arguing that its structure left it open to management influence,
which the ANA denies.
</P>
<P>
   MNA leaders who want a split complain that while 68 percent of
ANA dues come from staff nurses, 56 percent of the delegates who
set its agenda are from management or academia and are less likely
to be concerned about rank-and-file nursing issues. The ANA says it
does not keep track of the dues breakdown but points out that its
union has its own all-labor governing body and a budget of $3.5
million.
</P>
<P>
   Teachers, musicians, and actors have had similar arguments over
whether they are best represented by unions or professional groups.
But the nurses' debate resonates more strongly with the public,
Juravich said, because unions have worked hard to define the plight
of nurses in terms of larger societal issues such as access to
health care.
</P>
<P>
   That feeling was audible at a recent lunch at the 99 Restaurant,
not far from the state group's headquarters, where several members
used sweeping terms in their pitch for secession.
</P>
<P>
   ``The MNA is committed to a radical transformation of the health
care system in Massachusetts, to getting the corporations and the
insurance companies out of the picture,'' said Sandy Eaton, 56.
``The MNA is my political party.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We're organizing nurses for political action,'' said Karen
Higgins, 46, the MNA's elected chair of labor relations. She dubbed
the ANA's union ``a piece of fluff.''
</P>
<P>
   MNA president Karen Daley, who opposes the split, said the fact
that nurses' issues affect all of society means that the group
should see the value in taking a more moderate approach at times.
</P>
<P>
   ``Collective bargaining is only one tool,'' she said. But to
influence public policy, ``you also have to have access and
respect'' in places such as Washington.
</P>
<P>
   Both sides insist that nurses can think of themselves as
professionals and union members at the same time. Said Higgins:
``We're using collective bargaining as a tool to defend our
profession.''

SOME COLLEGES STRUGGLE WITH THE NAME GAME 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DAVID ABEL AND PATRICK HEALY  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Pity the students at Beaver College in Pennsylvania, the butt of
so many jokes based on the school's unfortunate name.
</P>
<P>
   ``The word `beaver' too often elicits ridicule in the form of
derogatory remarks pertaining to the rodent (and) the TV show
`Leave It to Beaver,' '' Beaver's president lamented.
</P>
<P>
   Things aren't much better for Dyke College in Cleveland, whose
name is slang for lesbian. Or even the University of Rio Grande, a
name that would be fine if the school was near the Mexican border.
It's actually in southern Ohio.
</P>
<P>
   For colleges, which depend on their name to help attract
students as well as financial backers, perception can all too often
be reality. And in some cases, the name can be grossly misleading _
or just plain gross. Last month, Beaver trustees began the process
of changing its name. Dyke made the change in 1995; Rio Grande,
meanwhile, may do so soon.
</P>
<P>
   Now, New Hampshire College officials are joining the name game,
announcing next year the school will be known as Southern New
Hampshire University. ``University,'' school officials believe,
carries more cachet than ``college.'' Administrators are so ardent
on this point that they plan to spend about $1 million on marketing
the new name, changing everything from the signage to the
stationery at its eight New England sites.
</P>
<P>
   ``It reflects more of what we've become,'' said the president,
Richard A. Gustafson, since the school increasingly offers graduate
programs that are more characteristic of a university than a
college.
</P>
<P>
   At Beaver College, whose name has brought laughter since the
suburban Philadelphia college opened in 1853, the ridicule began to
cut into the bottom line.
</P>
<P>
   In 1997, according to Beaver officials, market research found 30
percent of prospective students wouldn't even consider attending
the college because of its name. The college, which administrators
hope to rename by next year, has had to send out nearly three times
as many mailings as similar schools to attract equal numbers of
students.
</P>
<P>
   Beaver also had another problem: Internet filters set up to
screen out smut often blocked access to the college's Web site,
www.beaver.edu, because ``beaver'' is a vulgar reference to the
female anatomy. Some programs even censored e-mail messages sent
from Beaver.
</P>
<P>
   ``We believed the name was hindering us too much,'' said Beaver
College spokesman Bill Avington. And, he said, they're just
following the lead of nearby Philadelphia College of Textiles and
Science, which is now called the less-limiting Philadelphia
University.
</P>
<P>
   In the same way, after years of fending off cheap, wearying
insults, Dyke College five years ago became David N. Myers College,
named after a longtime benefactor.
</P>
<P>
   Officials at the small college in Cleveland, however, didn't
need any studies to tell them they had a public-relations problem.
</P>
<P>
   ``The original name, particularly among high school kids,
solicited snickers and it made it more difficult to recruit,'' said
James Zaferopolos, a spokesman for the 152-year-old college. ``When
we changed it, it was a big burden off our backs.''
</P>
<P>
   Mockery was not the reason Belleville Area College transformed
into Southwestern Illinois College, school officials insist. Even
though students long joked that the college's previous initials
meant Bring All (Your) Crayons, officials said the new moniker
accounted for the college's expansion beyond the city of
Belleville.
</P>
<P>
   Still, officials at the community college of 23,000 students
didn't fail to account for the value of a new name. ``The name just
sounds more impressive, and it may look better on a resume. We hope
it helps attract more students,'' said Jim Haverstick, a spokesman
for the college.
</P>
<P>
   Those hopes are echoed at the University of Rio Grande, which
has long relied on distinguishing itself from an institution near
the Mexican border by mispronouncing the ``i'' in Rio as an ``i,''
instead of an ``e.''
</P>
<P>
   Yet the small college in south-central Ohio is only discussing
the move, said Kathleen Gierehart, a school spokeswoman. Like
others there, she hopes the college can soon remove a tagline on
its Web site, saying, ``We're not in Texas.''
</P>
<P>
   As for New Hampshire College, not everyone is rallying to its
new banner. Officials at the University of New Hampshire have
complained to the New Hampshire secretary of state that the new
name was ``deceptively similar'' to the university's. Both are
located in the state's southern region.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you use a state name in your name, you're usually
associated with a public, state-supported university,'' said
Phyllis Bennett, a UNH spokeswoman.
</P>
<P>
   The college tested out several names with alumni, students, and
professors, and the new one was the favorite, Gustafson said. The
catchiest, he said, was Amoskeag University, from the name of a
local spot on the Merrimack River where Native Americans used to
fish.
</P>
<P>
   All too aware of the confusion names can generate, college
officials shelved that idea. ``While it had a lot of local
appeal,'' Gustafson said, ``we also heard a lot of, `How do you
spell it?' ''

LEADOFF IS A HIGH PRIORITY FOR THE RED SOX 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DAN SHAUGHNESSY  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEATTLE _ Leading off. Setting the table. Hitting from the top
spot in the batting order.
</P>
<P>
   The Patriots and 49ers led off the 2000 Monday Night Football
season. House Speaker Jay Dennis Hastert (R-Illinois) was first to
the podium at the Republican National Convention. Three decades
ago, Richie Havens led off at Woodstock.
</P>
<P>
   The leadoff hitter is an important part of any baseball team,
and with 59 games left to play, the Boston Red Sox find themselves
without a dependable, daily leadoff guy. Jose Offerman is on the
shelf for at least two weeks with a deep bone bruise in his knee
and Jimy Williams is bound to employ more leadoff men than
Elizabeth Taylor.
</P>
<P>
   Leading off for the 2000 Red Sox is like opening for the Rolling
Stones: Some fans are not yet in their seats when you come out to
perform. Many patrons are simply waiting for Nomar Garciaparra to
come up. Your job is to help out the main act.
</P>
<P>
   No less than six players have hit first for the Sox this year.
In six games on this trip, we've already seen Darren Lewis, Trot
Nixon, and Mike Lansing there. Donnie Sadler and Jeff Frye, too.
Before it's over, maybe we'll see Clydesdale Jason Varitek in the 1
Hole.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our lineup is game by game,'' said the manager. ``We want the
top people in our lineup to be scoring most of the runs. I'm not
saying we could use anybody, but Trot did a good job and Darren is
a prototype leadoff hitter.''
</P>
<P>
   Sox fans with short memories might have forgotten that Nomar
batted leadoff in every game of his 1997 Rookie of the Year season.
</P>
<P>
   ``It didn't change the way I hit,'' Garciaparra said. ``The game
dictates how you hit. Right now we're going with a lot of different
people there because we've got a lot of people out, but that's
nothing new.''
</P>
<P>
   It is a happy coincidence for a man writing about leadoff
hitters that the Red Sox are playing at Safeco Field this week
because Seattle is the new professional residence of the greatest
leadoff hitter who ever lived: Rickey Henderson.
</P>
<P>
   There are always going to be hardball arguments regarding Walter
Johnson vs. Cy Young vs. Bob Gibson vs. Sandy Koufax. Babe Ruth,
Willie Mays, Ted Williams, and Henry Aaron inspire similar debate.
But there can be no argument when it comes to leadoff hitters.
Henderson is the all-time stolen base king, a man who still led his
league in walks at the age of 39 and who most recently reached base
eight times Sunday and Monday against the Jays and Sox,
respectively. He holds the big league record with 78 career leadoff
home runs and ranks third all time in career walks, trailing only
Ruth and Williams.
</P>
<P>
   Tell us, Rickey, what is the most important thing a leadoff man
must do?
</P>
<P>
   ``Be patient and know the strike zone,'' he said. ``The leadoff
man is very important for a team. You've got to get a lot of
runners on base and create situations where you can steal a run.
That's how you create runs.''
</P>
<P>
   Henderson said a man batting leadoff doesn't have to alter his
batting game plan. Red Sox batting coach Tommy Harper, who led off
for the majority of his starry career, said, ``As a leadoff man,
you've got to take some pitches. You sometimes have to take the
3-and-1 pitch late in the game. You want to make the pitcher use as
many pitches as you can and you've always got guys coming up to you
and asking, `What's he throwing?' ''
</P>
<P>
   At the lower levels of baseball, it's not unusual to have the
best hitter on the team batting leadoff. Little League coaches
often put the big home run hitter in the top spot because it brings
that kid to the plate an extra 10 or 20 times a season. This theory
was used at the big league level when the Giants had Bobby Bonds
batting leadoff.
</P>
<P>
   Legendary Orioles manager Earl Weaver sometimes used trickery in
the top spot when Baltimore was on the road. In the late 1970s,
when the Orioles were carrying only eight or nine pitchers and had
a raft of available pinch hitters, Weaver would occasionally burn
one in the first inning. Kiko Garcia would lead off the game, only
to be replaced by light-hitting Mark Belanger at short in the
bottom of the first. It riled Belanger but got Baltimore an extra
chance for a first-inning homer.
</P>
<P>
   Jerry Remy led off for much of his career, but batted second for
the 1978 Red Sox because Rick Burleson was more comfortable in the
top spot. Wade Boggs hit third, second, and first for most of his
career. Boggs's on-base percentage was always tops in baseball but
he clogged up the basepaths once he got there. John McNamara liked
to put Dwight Evans in the leadoff spot because Evans had a good
eye and could score 100 runs.
</P>
<P>
   Lansing said he led off for the Expos in 1994 and spent some
time in the top spot for the Rockies before he had back surgery in
'99. Nixon led off for Pawtucket in 1998.
</P>
<P>
   ``I like it,'' Nixon said. ``It teaches you to be patient at the
plate.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I think Trot's a good candidate,'' said Harper.
</P>
<P>
   Not against Seattle lefty John Halama, Trot sat while we watched
Lewis, Gilkey, and Izzy Alcantara in another weird Jimyworld lineup
that had Lansing leading off.
</P>
<P>
   Lansing was 1 for 8 through 16 innings and couldn't get a bunt
down in the 15th.

LONGTIME BATTLER SHARON FIGHTS FOR HOLD ON JERUSALEM 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By CHARLES M. SENNOTT  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   JERUSALEM _ In May 1948, Ariel Sharon, then a young platoon
commander for the nascent Israeli army, was wounded in the battle
of Latrun, fighting to break the siege of Jerusalem by Arab forces.
</P>
<P>
   Now 52 years later, the legendary general and leader of the
conservative Likud party is still fighting for Jerusalem, which
Sharon believes is under siege once again _ this time by Prime
Minister Ehud Barak's peace moves.
</P>
<P>
   In an interview Tuesday, Sharon announced the formation of a
coalition dedicated to preserving Jerusalem and said he would
oppose efforts to yield parts of the holy city to Palestinian
control.
</P>
<P>
   The last of the 1948 generation of leaders still left standing
on Israel's political landscape, Sharon finds himself once again on
the front lines of the nation's history.
</P>
<P>
   If, as many analysts believe, Barak is forced to call early
elections, Sharon, 72, is considered a likely candidate to face
him. To do so, he will have to stave off challenges from former
prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu, now mired in a corruption
scandal, and Jerusalem Mayor Ehud Olmert, who was edged out last
year by Sharon as Likud's leader.
</P>
<P>
   Some political analysts wonder if Sharon could yet be tapped by
Barak for a national unity government, a scenario that Sharon has
ruled out, at least for now.
</P>
<P>
   Speaking for two hours with a group of foreign reporters, Sharon
explained why he felt Barak had compromised Israeli security and
undermined the nation's hold on Jerusalem as its ``eternal and
united'' capital by offering too many concessions at last month's
Middle East summit at Camp David.
</P>
<P>
   The interview became as much about Sharon, the man, as Sharon,
the potential candidate. He offered the reflections of an aging
warrior as he said, ``All the rights of the land are Jewish
rights,'' and ``There is no sharing of Jerusalem.''
</P>
<P>
   Known in Israel by his nickname, ``Arik,'' Sharon is a political
lightning rod, loathed by the left and adored by the right.
</P>
<P>
   Zev Chafetz, a columnist for the English-language magazine
Jerusalem Report, said, ``You'd be hard-pressed to name anyone who
has had such a big influence in his country over such a long time _
not just in Israel but anywhere in the world.''
</P>
<P>
   Sharon created the mold for Israel's legendary commando units
after being hand-picked by Israel's founding father, David
Ben-Gurion, to create and lead the first such unit, the 101. He was
seen as an heroic commander and cunning strategist, credited with
helping save Israel from defeat in the war of 1973.
</P>
<P>
   But Sharon's policies also polarized the nation. As defense
minister, he was blamed for Israel's Vietnam, a quagmire in Lebanon
that would claim hundreds of Israeli lives and tear at the
country's moral fabric. It would take 22 years for Israel finally
to crawl out.
</P>
<P>
   Sharon's career was stained by the massacre of Palestinian
civilians at the hands of Israeli-allied Lebanese Christian forces
at the Sabra and Shatila refugee camps in Beirut in 1982. Sharon
took on Time magazine in a libel battle over his role in the
massacre. A New York jury ruled that Time defamed him but denied
damages. In 1983, an Israeli government commission declared that
Sharon bore ``personal responsibility'' for ignoring warnings of a
massacre.
</P>
<P>
   As a Likud stalwart, Sharon embraced the aggressive construction
of Jewish settlements on the West Bank. Those settlements are among
the core difficulties in achieving peace.
</P>
<P>
   As Yoel Marcus, a columnist for the Haaretz newspaper, put it,
``Only the person who built the time bomb called the settlements
really knows how to dismantle it without us all exploding.''
</P>
<P>
   Sharon's shifts on the settlement issue reflect just how much
the peace process has changed Israel. In 1998 Sharon, as
Netanyahu's foreign minister, agreed to an interim pact that would
cede 9 percent of the West Bank to Palestinian control ``and not an
inch more,'' as he said at the time.
</P>
<P>
   Now Barak is talking about Israeli troop withdrawals from 95
percent of the West Bank. And Sharon, vaguely hinting at
flexibility, said that ``in peace, concessions are made. We are
ready to make concessions. But not to the degree that Barak has
done.''
</P>
<P>
   Sharon maintains that Barak, at Camp David, was ready to yield
too much ground to Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat, especially by
outlining a formula for shared sovereignty of Jerusalem. By that
move, Barak has lost the confidence of the Israeli people, Sharon
says, resulting in Monday's stunning defeat of Labor party veteran
Shimon Peres in a parliamentary vote for president.
</P>
<P>
   Sharon, who grew up on a secular collective farm and admits he
is ``not at all religious,'' has grabbed the issue of Jerusalem,
perhaps sensing that the language of Israeli-Palestinian politics
is often cast in religious terms. In the last month the religious
debate intensified during the US-mediated talks on the future of
Jerusalem, claimed as a capital by both Israelis and Palestinians,
and held holy by Christians, Jews, and Muslims.
</P>
<P>
   Tuesday, Sharon announced the formation of the ``Jerusalem
Coalition,'' 58 parliament members from the major conservative and
religious parties, including Likud, Shas, the Russian immigrant
party, and the National Religious Party.
</P>
<P>
   He sidestepped suggestions that Jerusalem's shrines were not
seen a half-century ago as central to the secular, Zionist founders
of Israel. ``Jerusalem is the capital of the Jewish people for
3,000 years,'' Sharon replied. ``The Temple Mount is the holiest
place of the Jewish people, and don't think for a minute we will
give up sovereignty there.''
</P>
<P>
   Sharon, whose wife Lily died of cancer in March, lives on a farm
in the Negev desert. But recently, he said, he has also been
staying at his home in the Muslim quarter of Jerusalem's Old City.
</P>
<P>
   He leased the home in 1987, just as the Palestinian uprising was
getting under way, after an Arab family was evicted for failure to
pay rent. The move was seen as a provocation by Palestinians and
many liberal Israelis, including the then-Jerusalem mayor, Teddy
Kollek.
</P>
<P>
   Today, Sharon has a 20-foot Israeli flag on the towering wall of
the home that faces out on the Muslim quarter. He erected a roughly
10-foot steel menorah with plastic-encased lights that looks as
much like military hardware as a symbol of the Jewish faith.
</P>
<P>
   ``Symbols are important,'' he said. ``Symbols are sacred.''
</P>
<P>
   Clearly, Sharon has executed a stunning political return in the
past two years from the dark days after the 1982 Lebanon invasion.
Once passed over by the Labor elite, observers said, he has been a
Likud stalwart for two decades and and now stands as Barak's main
domestic rival.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sharon made his comeback already. It was a tough climb,'' said
Zeev Schiff, military and political affairs commentator for
Haaretz. ``He wants to climb even higher, but I have my doubts. We
would need a real crisis for people to want to turn to Sharon.''

<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR; Chances are you have heard the analogy comparing frenetic
development of the Internet to a gold rush, in which the big
winners are not prospectors but the people who sell picks and
shovels.
</P>
<P>
   The virtual-world equivalents, Web infrastructure giants such as
Cisco Systems Inc. and EMC Corp., in fact have made a killing. But
no gold rush ever placed a value on advice or information.
</P>
<P>
   Companies that sell technical research to other companies
spending billions of dollars buying equipment and even turning
business models on their heads are reporting dramatic surges in
revenues and profits this year.
</P>
<P>
   None of those companies have captured the stock market's
attention like Forrester Research Corp., the Cambridge, Mass. firm
launched by chief executive George Colony from his basement as a
one-man shop 17 years ago. The large interest he still retains in
Forrester, about 38.5 percent, is worth nearly $500 million today.
</P>
<P>
   Forrester shares are up 71 percent so far this year and have
nearly quadrupled in the past 12 months. The stock has advanced
nearly 15-fold since it went public in November 1996.
</P>
<P>
   Investors are attracted to Forrester's huge business growth and
the prospects for more. Last week, the company said its
second-quarter revenue soared by 95 percent and profits more than
doubled.
</P>
<P>
   Forrester is hardly alone. Companies such as International Data
Corp., Jupiter Communications Inc., Giga Information Group Inc.,
the Yankee Group, and the biggest of them all, Gartner Group Inc.,
are enjoying sharply growing business.
</P>
<P>
   They are riding a wave of expensive technology change that will
require technical advice and information for years to come,
according to the people selling the research.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is not a two-year thing,'' said Robert Weiler, chief
executive of Cambridge-based Giga. ``This is a 5- to 10-year rise,
just on the technology we can see now, as companies have to go out
and change their business models.''
</P>
<P>
   But Forrester has captured greater attention among investors by
convincing them the company's broad research is more likely to be
ahead of the technology curve, that its ideas will matter more.
</P>
<P>
   ``Whether they are knowledgeable or not, they have branded
themselves as being the most knowledgeable source in the new
economy,'' said stock analyst Ullas Naik of First Albany Corp.
</P>
<P>
   Ideas, visibility, and marketing drive that image. Forrester's
researchers are paid based on a complicated formula that considers
their involvement in closing sales and appearances in the media.
</P>
<P>
   ``You have to be visible,'' Colony said of his company. ``You
have to be quoted, to be on CNBC.''
</P>
<P>
   There are also those predictions about the future, especially
the billions of dollars to be spent someday on this or that via the
Web. Those numbers often turn out to be way off, but they regularly
get attention in newspapers and on television.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts who follow the research company say no one really takes
the actual numbers very seriously, but instead are interested in
the direction of electronic business forecast by leading research
companies.
</P>
<P>
   It has all paid off for Forrester so far. The company's stock
market value modestly exceeds that of the Gartner Group, though its
revenues are just one-fifth as large. Jupiter, the company seen to
be its closest head-to-head competitor, agreed to be sold last
month for about a third of Forrester's stock value.
</P>
<P>
   Forrester makes some of its money by advising big corporate
clients how to move parts of its business onto the Internet, such
as its work with General Motors and its ``EGM'' Web project and
with Federal Express to move shipping onto the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   But 75 percent of Forrester's revenues are generated by research
reports sold to about 1,900 clients around the world, typically
companies spending big money on technology and looking for
information to help direct their decisions.
</P>
<P>
   A sampling of ``baseline'' research categories available on
Forrester's own Web site Tuesday: the best practices for online
marketing, business-to-business Internet trends, and the ``European
ECommerce Experience,'' each a bundle of research reports available
with the click of a mouse for $2,495 per.
</P>
<P>
   Forrester and Jupiter are distinguished from some other research
firms because they focus on broadly changing business strategies
driven by the Internet and other technology. Others supply more
tactical information about vendors, individual products or
services, how they work and what they should cost.
</P>
<P>
   ``Forrester is not an information business at all,'' said
Colony. ``Information is a commodity, the Web has proven that. We
are an idea factory. Ideas have to be at a level that's compelling
so they move infectiously through the economy.''
</P>
<P>
   But the research business is generating so much money it is
growing in ways that probably will change the competitive
landscape.
</P>
<P>
   Gartner Group, the big information company, has started to move
into Forrester's strategy business. Jupiter is being acquired by
Media Metrix Inc., which will be able to blend strategy with
proprietary raw data.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're all sort of converging, melding their offerings,''
said analyst Anthea Stratigos of Outsell Inc. ``But Forrester and
Jupiter are both still considered thought leaders.''
</P>
<P>
   On the other hand, smaller shops such as the Aberdeen Group of
Boston are able to carve out lucrative niches in the research
market. Another, Mainspring Inc. of Cambridge, went public just
last week.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, big consulting firms such as Bain Consulting, the
Boston Consulting Group and others may be more direct competitors
in the future.
</P>
<P>
   Colony believes Forrester will become a multi-billion-dollar
company amid all that competition as it expands in Europe and
around the world. He thinks the company has developed just the
culture to compete in that kind of environment.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're highly paranoid at all times,'' he said.

A CLEAR AND PRESENT DANGER

(Eds: Fact box below) 
Our rating: 1 1/2 stars 
By DAVID KRONKE 
c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News 
<TEXT>
<P>
   The T.S. Eliot poem which inspired the title, if little else,
for ``Hollow Man'' begins:
</P>
<P>
   ``We are the hollow men / We are the stuffed men / Leaning
together / Headpiece filled with straw. Alas!''
</P>
<P>
   Eliot is clearly giving those responsible for ``Hollow Man'' far
too much credit. It's your standard-issue summer moron-o-rama,
boasting a workable premise (cribbed, naturally, from a better
movie made almost 60 years ago and itself based on an H.G. Wells
novel), decent special effects and characters who would behave more
intelligently than they do here were their heads actually filled
with straw.
</P>
<P>
   Kevin Bacon stars as Sebastian Caine, one of those hotshot
government researchers who wears a cool black leather trenchcoat
and cranks up the tunes as he corners hard in his Porsche
convertible _ you know the type. He leads a study on invisibility,
overseeing some hipster scientists who look to be on loan from the
WB network. Being the rebel/sociopath that he is, Sebastian,
without permission, offers himself as the first
there's-no-there-there human experiment; things, naturally, don't
go as expected.
</P>
<P>
   Though ``Hollow Man's'' press notes cite both Plato and
Christopher Marlowe, the sensibility most at work here is director
Paul Verhoeven's. Here's how Sebastian cashes in on his
invisibility: In throwaway gags, he scares a couple of kids and
confuses a homeless guy; in tediously protracted sequences, he
molests a colleague's breast and apparently rapes a neighbor whose
entire life consists of little more than removing her clothing
while her blinds remain tantalizingly almost open. Verhoeven, as
they say, likes to watch, but he's not keen on thinking _ the film
takes place in Washington, D.C.; wouldn't a scientist like
Sebastian get a kick out of being a fly on the wall in the Oval
Office or other halls of power?
</P>
<P>
   Caine's mutiny, nonetheless, also extends to murder, which
causes his co-workers a bit of consternation only once they realize
they're next on his hit list. Elisabeth Shue and Josh Brolin _
casting director Howard Feuer's idea of brilliant scientists _
share above-the-title billing with Bacon; follow the traditional
slasher-flick template and don't become too attached to anyone
else. Apparently, invisibility also induces superhuman strength, as
Sebastian, even though he's naked, becomes as insanely
insurmountable a force as, say, Freddie Krueger.
</P>
<P>
   OK, whatever; but here's the rub _ none of these geniuses seem
to be able to remember that they each have a pair of heat-sensitive
goggles that would allow them to see Sebastian on the course of his
lethal perambulations. That's just the most crucial lapse in logic
``Hollow Man'' boasts _ there are plenty of others, which
exasperated viewers will have time to tally for themselves as their
patience with the pyrotechnics eventually diminishes.
</P>
<P>
   Sure, the special effects _ in which test subjects disappear and
reappear vein by vein, organ by organ, bone by bone _ are pretty
impressive, but then, James Whale's 1933 ``Invisible Man'' had darn
cool effects and decent story and characterizations. This is
shaping up as the summer where CGI achieves endgame: Films like
``Dinosaur'' and ``The Perfect Storm'' have proved that when
anything is possible in a movie, then very little will actually be
capable of wowing us.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps the most dismaying spectacle available to ``Hollow Man''
viewers is watching credible, ``name'' thespians like Bacon and
Shue reduced to the kind of blockheaded performances Verhoeven
expertly drew from his players in amateurishly essayed productions
like ``Showgirls'' and ``Starship Troopers.'' Nonetheless, T.S.
Eliot was wrong about one thing: Since this is a summer movie, the
world ends with a bang, an increasingly ear-splitting series of
them, in fact. The whimper will be the audience's, as, battered
into dull submission, it skulks benumbed from the theater.

TORIES' LEADER STOPS SHORT OF ENDORSEMENT FOR BUSH 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By KEVIN CULLEN  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   LONDON _ It was appropriate that William Hague, leader of the
British opposition, all but endorsed George W. Bush in the
Philadelphia suburb King of Prussia, speaking before Republican
activists on the fringes of their convention.
</P>
<P>
   After all, the Pennsylvania town that is best known to Americans
as having one the biggest shopping malls in the United States is
better known to Britons as having been named in honor of Frederick
the Great, who helped the British defeat the French in the Seven
Years' War.
</P>
<P>
   Hague, whose Conservative Party has mostly floundered since Tony
Blair's Labor Party won the biggest parliamentary majority in
nearly two centuries in May 1997, envisions a new ``special
relationship'' between Washington and London. His hope: that the
Republicans can retake the White House and become the Tories'
allies in ousting Labor at the next general election in Britain.
</P>
<P>
   After suffering nothing but humiliation for nearly three years,
the Tories are on something of a roll. Blair's Teflon image has
slipped, as has Labor's popularity, which is now in the single
digits over the Conservatives. A series of recently leaked internal
Labor memorandums show a government on the defensive, worrying that
the Conservatives are more in tune with British public opinion on
patriotism and being tough on crime.
</P>
<P>
   No surprise, then, to hear Hague sing the praises of Bush and
the Republicans. Still, in keeping with British diplomatic
protocol, which frowns on endorsing candidates in elections abroad,
Hague's not-quite-an-endorsement was coached in the language of
those who prepare for the hurly-burly of British politics at Oxford
and Cambridge universities.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is not for me to tell the voters of America how to vote,
but let me say this: George W. Bush is an impressive man with a
proud record,'' Hague told Republican activists at a Radisson hotel
Monday. ``We wish him well.''
</P>
<P>
   Hague's study and guarded courtship of the Republicans mirrors
Blair's efforts eight years ago. Then, Labor strategists, and Blair
himself, assiduously researched how Bill Clinton marginalized
left-wing activists in the Democratic Party, moved the Democrats to
the center of the American political spectrum, and ended 12 years
of Republican control of the White House.
</P>
<P>
   Beholden to special interest groups, most notably the labor
unions, Blair's party was even more unelectable than the Democrats.
But he ended 18 years of uninterrupted Tory power by ignoring the
notoriously loud but politically impotent left wing of his party
and convincing an overwhelming majority of Britons that his vision
of Cool Britannia offered more for the future than the Tory vision
of Britain being, as the last Tory prime minister, John Major, put
it, ``a country of long shadows on county grounds, warm beer,
invincible green suburbs, dog lovers, and pools-fillers and, as
George Orwell said, old maids cycling to holy communion through the
morning mist.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, British politicians run a risk when they inject
themselves into US politics. The Clinton administration never
forgave Major after he gave Bush's father a similar endorsement in
1992.
</P>
<P>
   British diplomats remain convinced that Major's intervention on
the elder Bush's behalf was part of the reason the Clinton
administration injected itself into the Northern Ireland peace
process, and why it took less of a pro-British stand.
</P>
<P>
   Before Clinton was elected, the White House steered clear of
Northern Ireland, viewing it as a domestic British matter. But
Clinton, who became interested in the conflict while studying at
Oxford, decided American involvement could help bring about a
compromise. The Clinton administration broke precedent, treating
the Irish government and the British government as equals and
dispatching George Mitchell, the former Senate majority leader from
Maine, to mediate.
</P>
<P>
   Those same diplomats who believe Major's backing of Bush hurt
the ``special relationship'' also acknowledge that the Americans
played a mostly positive role in bringing about the Good Friday
Agreement of 1998, the compromise brokered by Mitchell aimed at
ending violence and turning the dispute over Northern Ireland into
one resolved strictly through peaceful, democratic means.
</P>
<P>
   ``Without Clinton, the peace process wouldn't have happened,''
said a senior official at the British Foreign Office.
</P>
<P>
   Already, some of the conservative standard bearers in Britain
are worried about Hague's enthusiastic embrace of Bush's
``compassionate conservatism,'' not for ideological reasons, but
because of the downsides should Al Gore win.
</P>
<P>
   Janet Daley, the Boston-born columnist for the Daily Telegraph,
the voice of British conservatism, Tuesday warned Hague to go easy
on imitating Bush, or at least to put compassionate conservatism in
context. Daley said Bush and Hague both believe in less taxes, less
government, and more individual choice in public education. Both
are tough on crime. But, she said, while Bush's positions are
considered compassionate conservatism on the American political
spectrum, Hague's views have been widely described in Britain as
extreme and hardline.
</P>
<P>
   ``When Republicans talk about compassionate conservatism, they
mean that they will refrain from kicking murderers all the way to
the electric chair,'' Daley said. ``When Mr. Bush talks soft, he is
only reining back on the virulent right-wing fundamentalism of the
American backwoods: the sort of people who shoot up abortion
clinics and want the babies of single mothers to be exposed to the
elements like rejected Chinese female infants.''
</P>
<P>
   Capital punishment, meanwhile, remains a political minefield in
Britain, where opposition to the death penalty is widespread and
cuts across party lines. Last year, Hague visited Bush at the
gubernatorial office in Austin to talk about compassionate
conservatism. After plans for that trip were announced, the Globe
asked Hague's spokesman, Gregor Mackay, to comment on how Bush's
enthusiastic embrace of capital punishment squared with
compassionate conservatism. Mackay declined to comment.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike Blair, who personally visited the convention floor when
the Democrats met in New York in 1992, Hague is leaving that
assignment to about a dozen senior party members.
</P>
<P>
   The Tories' visit to the Republican convention is only the first
British incursion at the American conventions. When the Democrats
convene in two weeks, Johnny Rotten, former lead singer of the punk
band the Sex Pistols, will cover the convention for the Web site
eYada.com.
</P>
<P>
   Bob Meyrowitz, eYada.com's founder, promises Rotten, whose 1970s
anarchist anthem ``God Save the Queen'' claimed the monarchy
represented a ``fascist regime,'' will ``turn this convention on
its head.''
</P>
<P>
   Rotten's lyrics are an indictment of the establishment,
especially politicians. In ``Liar,'' which attacks politicians
among others, he snarls that ``I know what I know. You're in
suspicion. You're a liar!''
</P>
<P>
   Unlike Hague, it is doubtful that Rotten will be making an
endorsement that isn't really an endorsement.
</P>
<P>
   ``I,'' declared the punk rocker, ``will never sit on the
fence.''

`SPACE COWBOYS' STILL HAVE THE RIGHT STUFF
</HEADLINE>

(Eds: Fact box below) 
Our rating: 3 stars 
By BOB STRAUSS 
c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Clint Eastwood's latest geezer fantasy is, basically, John Glenn
does ``Armageddon.'' Amiable to a fault _ by the time things mosey
around to a save-the-world third act, any potential for suspense
has been pleasantly frittered away _ ``Space Cowboys'' is much more
successful as an easygoing character comedy than as awesome
astronaut adventure. Wrinkled charm is this vehicle's real solid
fuel.
</P>
<P>
   The concept could not be simpler, nor a more comfortable fit for
its macho-mellow stars. Eastwood's Frank, Tommy Lee Jones' Hawk,
Donald Sutherland's Jerry and James Garner's Tank were all hotshot
test pilots in the 1950s (the very nice, black-and-white opening
flashback offers young ringers for the famous actors dubbed by the
icons' unmistakable voices) who were bypassed for the space program
when NASA commandeered it from the Air Force.
</P>
<P>
   Forty-some years later, a key Russian communications satellite's
orbit is degrading, and it can only be fixed Up There. Since all
the current astronauts are too young to understand the obsolete
bird's operational system, the space program has to turn to the guy
who designed it _ that's right, Frank.
</P>
<P>
   What his work is doing in a 30-year-old Soviet craft is a good
question that is later answered in the most alarming way imaginable
(it's a Clint movie, so even though they may not be commies
anymore, you still can't trust those Russkies). Time's running out,
the vice president insists we help, and so Frank's hated ex-boss,
Gerson (James Cromwell), now a NASA bigwig, has to agree to the
snarling senior's demand that his old team be sent up on the
mission.
</P>
<P>
   If, of course, they can pass the physical. Training turns out to
be ``Space Cowboys''' most genial stretch, as the old buckaroos do
their best to feign fitness for the assignment. After all these
years, Tank's devolved into a boring, scatterbrained Baptist
minister, half-blind Jerry is happy test-driving roller coasters
and young mistresses, and Hawk, who has the most contentious
relationship with Frank, still hasn't gotten over his beloved
wife's death.
</P>
<P>
   But, of course, they all want their long-postponed shot at
space. Prep time, some of which was filmed at the actual Johnson
Space Center and Cape Canaveral in Florida, is a jokey affair; the
boys are constantly told about old colleagues who've died and the
few still around inevitably greet Frank with a cheery, ``You never
were a team player.''
</P>
<P>
   Despite the supposed urgency of the situation, there is time for
a May-December romance (Marcia Gay Hardin is the comely scientist
half), a bar brawl and new Clint one-liners like ``Clock's ticking,
Bob, and I'm only getting older.'' Later, there's a cancer scare,
orbital complications and opportunities for noble self-sacrifice.
</P>
<P>
   It all gets steadily more preposterous, and the dramatic
possibilities in the seniors' frailties remain frustratingly
unexplored.
</P>
<P>
   But you do leave the proceedings going ``Old guys rule!'' The
superannuated ensemble serves up effortless rapport, and it's all
agreeable, midrange Eastwood entertainment, nothing profound but
put across with smooth aplomb by his usual crack team of
cinematographer Jack N. Green, production designer Henry Bumstead
and composer Lennie Niehaus.
</P>
<P>
   Even though ``Space Cowboys'' is fundamentally meaningless, I
have little doubt that, in a quarter century or so, it'll mean a
whole lot more to me. &QL;

LIVING ACCORDING TO THE `TAO OF STEVE'
</HEADLINE>
  (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
(Eds: Fact box below) 
Our rating: 3 1/2 stars 
By BOB STRAUSS 
c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Dex (Donal Logue) is the pickup artist of Santa Fe. Any woman
who enters his crosshairs _ cynical or naive, single or married,
doesn't matter _ is soon stricken, all thanks to his subtle mastery
of ``The Tao of Steve.''
</P>
<P>
   It ain't because Dex is a Greek god, that's for sure. Yes, back
in the day, he was quite a handsome devil (the film opens up
amusingly with an astonishing chorus of ``I can't believe I fell
for hims'' from the female attendees of a 10-year class reunion).
But now he looks like Chris Farley's not-so-little brother,
possesses few professional aspirations beyond his part-time job as
a kindergarten teacher and still shares a house with three equally
immature buddies.
</P>
<P>
   Still, he gets just about any woman he wants with a multi-point
strategy of passive/aggressive interest/disinterest that's equal
parts zen and the result of watching too many Steve McQueen movies.
But you'll notice that we said just about any woman, and thereby
hangs the tale of this smart, shaggy and often tantalizingly fresh
romantic comedy.
</P>
<P>
   The sloppy charmer meets his match in Syd (Greer Goodman), a New
York set designer in town to do some staging for the Santa Fe
Opera. She strongly resists him at first (there's a reason), but
his charm and relentlessness eventually make headway. However, the
extra effort takes a toll on Dex; he might just have to attempt a
grown-up relationship for a change. Even more alarming, this could
be love.
</P>
<P>
   Three elements raise this rather commonplace storyline to
intriguing heights. First and foremost is Logue, an actor of
prodigious warmth. He never allows Dex to appear either pathetic or
overconfident and lends an irresistible, little-boy charm to the
large lothario's ceaseless calculating. Recognizable from small
parts in ``Runaway Bride,'' ``Blade'' and ``The Patriot,'' Logue is
a radiantly intelligent actor who can whip up the most complex
emotional cocktails without the slightest aftertaste of strain.
</P>
<P>
   The second plus factor is the unobtrusively educated dialogue
that bounces off the New Mexicans' tongues. The three writers _
Goodman, her sister Jenniphr (who also makes her feature directing
debut with ``Tao'') and Duncan North (on whom the character of Dex
is reportedly based) _ know their town well, and that (generally)
unpretentious intellectualism is the lingua franca of that art
colonized community, even among its Frisbee-tossing, poker- playing
set. Rare is the movie that can act naturally while sustaining
brainy conversation and a sense of humor; even Woody Allen seems
arch by comparison.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, the film is cast with real-looking people. Not just the
hefty Logue, but his friends and the many unglamorously attractive
women who cross his path have such a refreshingly everyday quality
to them that you almost don't notice some of the romantic comedy
situations they're working are as contrived as anything you've seen
Julia Roberts twinkle through.
</P>
<P>
   Still, you do notice, and that predictable business can get a
bit annoying. But heck, ``The Tao of Steve'' has smarts,
personality and it's own, unique, after-a-few-drinks beauty
(director Goodman is no killer with the camera, but happily it's
impossible to make the Land of Enchantment look bad).
</P>
<P>
   Heck, nobody's perfect, after all. &QL; 
----------------- &QL; 
The film: ``The Tao of Steve'' (R; sex, language, drug use). &QL; 
The stars: Donal Logue, Greer Goodman, Kimo Wills, Ayelet
Kaznelson. &QL;

North and Jenniphr and Greer Goodman. Produced by Anthony Bregman.

PROGRESSIVE STREAK SEEN IN RELIGIOUS VOTERS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MICHAEL PAULSON  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Think of the recent examples in which politicians have overtly
courted religious voters: George W. Bush speaks at the
fundamentalist Bob Jones University and meets with Boston's
Cardinal Bernard F. Law, Hillary Rodham Clinton speaks at an
Orthodox synagogue in New York.
</P>
<P>
   Conservative Protestants, Catholics and Jews have become visible
and influential players in national politics, and conservative
religious values have become an important part of many policy
debates.
</P>
<P>
   But a prominent Princeton University scholar argues that the
focus on groups like the Christian right has overshadowed a reality
of the relationship between religion and politics: there is a
strong progressive streak among religious voters.
</P>
<P>
   ``The perception that religious groups are really only
interested in conservative issues is not true,'' said Princeton
sociologist Robert Wuthnow. ``They are not only focused on issues
such as abortion or prayer in the schools. Progressive issues do
seem to be of enormous importance to people.''
</P>
<P>
   Wuthnow, who is leading a major study on mainline Protestantism
in America for the Pew Charitable Trusts, recently surveyed more
than 5,600 Americans of varying religious faiths about their views
on public policy.
</P>
<P>
   The survey found that beyond the hot button church-state issues,
nearly 60 percent of voters of all faiths, including evangelicals,
are interested in seeing government do more to protect the
environment, help the poor, overcome discrimination against women,
and promote international peace. Those polled were significantly
less interested in relief programs for Third World countries,
legislation that would reduce intolerance toward homosexuals, and
campaign finance reform.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have too often assumed that mainline Protestants are
politically dormant,'' Wuthnow said. ``These results show they are
politically interested and active.''
</P>
<P>
   Interestingly, those polled seemed to suggest that their
priorities were not the same as those articulated from the pulpit.
Sixty percent said they had not over the last year heard a sermon
on government policies toward the poor, and 56 percent said recent
sermons had not touched on environmental protection.
</P>
<P>
   But they generally reported social action by their churches.
Seventy-nine percent said their congregation had sponsored a soup
kitchen or food pantry in the last year.
</P>
<P>
   The poll found broad consensus on some matters of religious
faith and practice: 84 percent said the Bible is the inspired word
of God, 64 percent said they pray every day, and 87 percent said
spiritual growth is at least fairly important to them.
</P>
<P>
   But Americans seem to be somewhat ambivalent about exactly how
religous groups should interact with the political world.
</P>
<P>
   On one hand, 76 percent said religious leaders should express
their views on social and political issues. But they were wary of
some modes of expression associated with the Christian right: 66
percent want fewer religious leaders to criticize elected
officials, 59 percent want fewer religious leaders to form
political movements, and 52 percent said they would like to see
fewer religious leaders on television talk shows.

BEAUTIES AND THE BEAST
</HEADLINE>
  (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By BOB STRAUSS 
c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News 
<TEXT>
<P>
   ``Coyote Ugly,'' superproducer Jerry (``Flashdance'')
Bruckheimer's latest contribution to the collapse of Western
Civilization, is a movie about beer, dancing on bars and, of
course, self-empowerment. It charts the misadventures of five
lovely young women who work at the title tavern (which actually
exists) in New York City, where they're encouraged to strut, holler
and otherwise keep drinking men occupied.
</P>
<P>
   Before you get the wrong idea, these girls are not strippers or
hookers (this phenomenon, after all, is pretty specific to Rudolph
Giuliani's brave new puritanized Manhattan). They're just trying to
serve up some nice, clean fun between shots. They also wear a lot
of tight leather.
</P>
<P>
   Anyway, ``Coyote's'' five lead actresses seem to have had a good
time making the movie. Maria Bello (``ER''), Piper Perabo (``The
Adventures of Rocky and Bullwinkle''), Tyra Banks (Victoria's
Secret), Bridget Moynahan (``Sex and the City'') and Izabella Miko
(she's from Poland) spoke to the Daily News about their wild nights
in the big city.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Like all the members of the movie's target audience, we're
mainly interested in the girls' personalities. Can each of you
describe what your coyote is like?
</P>
<P>
   Bello: I play the character Lil, who's the boss of the bar. She
owns this place, she's worked her whole life to own and operate her
own business. She hires only women, and it's a great training
ground for them to go on and achieve their dreams.
</P>
<P>
   Miko: I play the role of Cammie, who works at the bar. She's a
very happy girl but she's a little bit naive and falls in love
constantly with, I guess, all the wrong guys because she doesn't
have a steady boyfriend. She makes friends with Violet; she's the
nice one.
</P>
<P>
   Perabo: I'm Violet, the sweet, innocent girl from the New Jersey
suburbs who's come to New York to make it as a songwriter. She
never wants to perform her own work, and that's where Coyote Ugly
comes in. She just gets a job there to pay her rent, but being
around all these loud, rowdy, raucous women begins to rub off on
her, and eventually it's what helps her get over her stage fright.
</P>
<P>
   Banks: My character, Zoe, is at the Coyote Ugly to make money
for law school. I consider her to be the crazy one. It wasn't
really written that way, but I noticed really strong personalities
when I read with the other girls: one was heavy flirtatious; one
was very, very tough; one was really shy; and one was really sweet.
So I just decided to make mine nuts, just screaming and dancing on
the bar.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Is that any way for an aspiring attorney to pursue her dream?
</P>
<P>
   Banks: Definitely! You have to be very animated in court, able
to intimidate and raise your voice.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Which means you, Bridget, must be ... ?
</P>
<P>
   Moynahan: ... The tough chick, Rachel. She sort of runs the
show, underneath Lil. She's definitely antagonistic toward the new
girl; it's sort of Rachel's game to do that.
</P>
<P>
   Q: OK, now that that's out of the way, just how sexy is this
thing?
</P>
<P>
   Bello: It's kind of like ``Flashdance,'' put in this new
setting, which is edgier. It might be wild, but it's not overtly
sexual; it's not violent in any way; it's not degrading to women or
to men in any way. It's certainly not a G Disney film, but it's
sexy without being too much, I think.
</P>
<P>
   Q: That's not exactly how they're selling it. The promotional
campaign makes it seem like one long drunken orgy.
</P>
<P>
   Moynahan: Well, we are working in Hollywood.
</P>
<P>
   Banks: In terms of moviemaking, you kind of have to sugarcoat
something to get people in there and get your message across. It's
like, I have a camp for young girls now called T-Zone. Its message
is about self-esteem and finding yourself and having a good body
image and pride about your heritage ... But we're not gonna sell it
like that! It's like, ``Oh, come to camp! We're gonna do ropes
courses and swim and play and have fun!''
</P>
<P>
   And that's kinda how it is with ``Coyote Ugly.'' You don't wanna
do ``Message!''_ cause who wants to be preached to? But if girls
are dancing on the bar and you're getting this message but don't
know you are ... It's like propaganda!
</P>
<P>
   Perabo: I mean, it doesn't hurt that the girls are awful pretty.
But for my character, there's a love story in it and it's a lot
about making it as a songwriter. The bar's just this kind of, like,
wild center in the film. But it's a fine line for me, as a woman,
whether you are exploiting yourself because you're pretty. I don't
know; it depends on how they cut the movie, really.
</P>
<P>
   Q: What's the wildest thing you do in the movie?
</P>
<P>
   Miko: We all do a water dance, which I think is pretty wild. We
pour pitchers of water on each other, which I thought was so fun.
Sexy, but cool.
</P>
<P>
   Moynahan: I set the bar on fire.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Did you do any research at the real Coyote Ugly?
</P>
<P>
   Bello: I've trained for this movie for 15 years, just being a
real bartender. But I stopped in at Hogs &AMP; Heifers and Red Rock
West, which are the same sorts of bars. I loved the vibes there,
and every time I went in, they were completely packed. Similar
stuff as in the movie goes on, for sure.
</P>
<P>
   Perabo: Actually, I was just in Coyote Ugly a couple of days
ago. The real Lil who owns it was there, with her baby. It's a lot
smaller than the set they built for the movie.
</P>
<P>
   Banks: Yeah, Hogs &AMP; Heifers is tiny, too.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Dance on the bar there?
</P>
<P>
   Banks: Yeah. I didn't want to, but they made me.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Was the dancing the hardest thing to do in the movie?
</P>
<P>
   Banks: No, I had dance training when I was a little girl. It
comes very naturally to me; I have a strong kind of street dancing
thing like Janet Jackson or Britney Spears, that kind of hip-hop
dancing.
</P>
<P>
   Perabo: I went to theater school, where it was requisite to take
ballet and modern. Learning to play the guitar was the hardest part
for me. To learn an instrument is no small task, and especially the
guitar because you need calluses on your fingers or forget it,
those chords. I play it OK now.
</P>
<P>
   Miko: I'm a professional dancer, so for me it was great just to
kind of let go instead of being very restricted, like in ballet.
There, you could do whatever you wanted; there was choreography,
but it was pretty loose.
</P>
<P>
   All of the bar stuff, trying to speed serve, that was pretty
challenging. They brought in professional jugglers to show us how
to do it.
</P>
<P>
   Moynahan: The bartending wasn't difficult for me. I'd never
taken a dance class, though, so it was lots of hard work just to
get to the level of Izabella, who had trained all her life. But I
think it came over; I think it worked.
</P>
<P>
   Bello: I own the place. I didn't have to dance.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Did you develop much camaraderie or, well, hate one another?
</P>
<P>
   Moynahan: Contrary to what everybody wishes went on, we all got
along.
</P>
<P>
   Perabo: Even though the dance rehearsals were kicking my butt,
they were really good for the movie itself because these women know
each other well and work hard together. They're bar-backing the
bar, too; there's no guys carrying the liquor up from underneath.
These girls work long hours together, and dance rehearsal was a
good way to build that bond between us.
</P>
<P>
   Q: So, like the women you portray, are you all ready for
``Coyote Ugly'' to help you achieve your dreams?
</P>
<P>
   Perabo: I don't know what to expect. It appears to be such a
surreal thing, that people would know you but you don't know them.
But even if you're not famous, people are crazy. You meet crazy
people, you walk away. You meet cool people, you hang.
</P>
<P>
   Banks: Piper got picked from all of these thousands of girls to
star in this movie. She's gonna be the next hot thing but she's
not, like, smellin' herself, and I'm impressed with that. People
are like, ``Tell her not to change, tell her how you didn't change,
Tyra.'' But I don't have to tell her that. You can just see that
she's gonna be all right.
</P>
<P>
   Moynahan: My dream, ultimately? I don't know, but I'm living
part of it right now. &QL;

 BARNET, Vt.: ... to serve.  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Behr is one of those people who is very critical about the
quality of food. And it's hard for him to feel satisfied with his
local ingredients. He used to be more interested in the simplicity
of life than he was in anything else.
</P>
<P>
   After college, he went shopping for a beautiful place to live.
He considered central Maine, which is desolate and filled with
scrub pines; St. Lawrence in New York, which is gray for six weeks
in the fall, ``but you could get a whole dairy, all the cattle, and
the family _ for $19,500''; and the Northeast Kingdom.
</P>
<P>
   At first he lived in Newark, Vt., a hill town. ``There were 175
people, it was quite poor, very high. Not a lot of towns in New
England that were that poor and depopulated.'' He built a stone
house at the end of an unpaved road, then did carpentry and some
printmaking, courtesy of a small grant from the Vermont Council on
the Arts. He also returned to his home near Washington, D.C., to
teach learning-disabled children for a while.
</P>
<P>
   He moved to Barnet in 1982. His long hair was already cut into a
crew cut, which he still has. Now it's gray, and he's traded
workman's clothes for black Italian shoes, slim jeans, small
European silver wire-rim glasses, and a dark olive-green polo shirt
that also looks Italian.
</P>
<P>
   When he began The Art of Eating, it combined his love of good
graphics with his intense curiosity about how things are made. In a
way, Behr had always been around the word business. His father was
a ``rewrite man'' for The Wall Street Journal and now acts as
Eating's informal editor. ``He reads everything,'' says Behr. ``He
doesn't know anything about food so he asks all the right
questions.'' Behr used to have other family ties. He is divorced
from Grace DiNapoli, who used to be his printer.
</P>
<P>
   The house in Barnet was built on the top of 15 acres that
overlook three dairy farms. ``Not a lot of places around here where
you can see that anymore.''
</P>
<P>
   Inside, his efficient, tidy, butter-yellow kitchen is open to a
room that serves as an office for his assistant. One corner is
stacked with computer paper and back copies of The Art of Eating,
but someday it will be home to a fireplace and stone oven. Boulders
for the project sit outside the front door in a huge mound,
sprouting weeds after their many years in the same spot. The pile
of stones is about the only unsightly thing in an otherwise
meticulous place.
</P>
<P>
   From his travels, Behr has all kinds of unusual cooking
implements, including a vinegar-making barrel on a shelf near the
site of the future fireplace. Old stoneware holds cooking tools and
flour. An open cabinet door reveals Mediterranean earthenware
pottery and two outsized mortars.
</P>
<P>
   One piece of pottery, from the Charentes in France, is ``cheap
peasant cookware,'' says Behr, because it's an all-purpose pot that
would be used even in the poorest households. It has the shape of a
deep round casserole, dark brown glaze inside, with an unglazed
earthenware surface, and it goes directly on a heat diffuser over a
flame for roasting chestnuts and potatoes. ``Eventually it will
crack,'' he says. Its only protection from heat is that he rubbed
garlic all over it before he used it _ a widespread peasant
superstition. Behr also returned home with a clockwork spit for his
fireplace, of the sort used for hearth cooking for hundreds of
years before the introduction of modern ovens.
</P>
<P>
   Everything about the place speaks to style, to a deep
appreciation of both ancient and contemporary design. A household
that is filled with old equipment has a dining room table
surrounded by molded iridescent-green Italian chairs and a tall
lamp on an aluminum photography light stand.
</P>
<P>
   He has thought about every single item on the table, including
the French plates and flatware, pink checkerboard cloth, and pink
windowpane napkins. It seems cheerful and thoughtful, but Behr, who
spends his life recording the movements of the people who make some
of the best food in the world, isn't so cheerful as he contemplates
the future. He frets that the little farmers in Europe who have
worked so long to maintain the highest standards of quality will
one day be ignored and finally forgotten.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think a lot of what I'm doing is recording the end of good
food,'' he says. Then he passes a plate of beautiful, oozingly rich
local Brie.
</P>
<P>

<P>
   For years Edward Behr wrote The Art of Eating by himself.
Lately, he has commissioned short pieces, which run at the end of
the newsletter. The summer issue, for instance, contains a piece on
Darjeeling by Montreal writer Kevin Gascoyne, and another on the
Egyptian dish melokhia by Nancy Harmon Jenkins. ``The logic is that
the (newsletter) has a life of its own,'' says Behr. ``It wants to
be more of a magazine.''
</P>
<P>
   Behr will continue to write the major pieces, which have
recently focused on the region of Emilia Romagna, considered to
have some of Italy's best food; the Iowa pig farm that supplies
pork to Chez Panisse in Berkeley, Calif.; and a tour of a
cooperative olive press, an oyster farm, and a bread bakery in
Sonoma, Calif. Behr is as interested in wine as he is in food, so
he is as likely to write about a vineyard as he is about, say, a
cheesemaker. Many newsletters end with several related recipes,
written in a loose, chatty style. This recipe for eggplant and
tomato came in the pork issue, along with a simple brine for
roasting pork, sweet-and-sour shallots, and a white wine-rosemary
sauce for pork. The recipe for potato cakes was printed at the end
of a discussion of dry-aged steak.

EGGPLANT AND TOMATO
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Behr took this recipe from an 1886 French cookbook by Marius
Morard, ``Manuel complet de la cuisiniere provencale.'' Morard, a
hotel cook, suggested pureeing this mixture through a sieve.
</P>
<P>
   1 pound eggplant
</P>
<P>
   1 pound tomatoes
</P>
<P>
   Extra-virgin olive oil
</P>
<P>
   1 tablespoon salt
</P>
<P>
   Black pepper
</P>
<P>
   About a dozen branches flat-leafed parsley
</P>
<P>
   1 clove garlic
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Peel the eggplant, cut in 3/4-dice, and mix with the salt. Allow
the eggplant to release its liquid for at least 1/2 hour. Rinse and
drain, and cook until tender in olive oil, stirring from time to
time. While the eggplant is cooking, peel the tomatoes (you can
loosen the skins by dipping the tomatoes for no more than 60
seconds in boiling water; cool in cold water). Halve the tomatoes
crosswise, scoop out the seeds with your finger, and chop the flesh
coarsely. Cook the tomato in olive oil until tender. Combine the
two vegetables, seasoning well with salt and pepper. Finely chop
the parsley and garlic shortly before serving, and sprinkle on top
or stir in.
</P>
<P>
   Serves 4.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
----- &QC; 
 &QL; 
POTATO CAKES
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   About 2 pounds of floury potatoes, such as russets
</P>
<P>
   4 tablespoons unsalted butter, plus more for frying
</P>
<P>
   Salt and pepper
</P>
<P>
   Bake the potatoes and cut them in half. One at a time, holding
the hot potatoes in a hand protected with a pad or folded towel,
spoon out the insides. Mash with butter and salt and pepper (no
liquid). Melt a tablespoon of butter in one or two large heavy
frying pans. Divide the mashed potato into four pieces. Flatten
each portion to form a roughly 3/4-inch-thick cake. Brown the cakes
well on one side before turning to brown the other side well.
</P>
<P>
   Serves 4.

<TEXT>
<P>
   BARNET, Vt. _ Edward Behr, publisher of The Art of Eating, a
food and wine newsletter that just celebrated its 10th year, was
fairly new to writing when he was invited to tour Italy with five
American authors. His fellow travelers _ Carol Field, Nancy Harmon
Jenkins, Corby Kummer, Fred Plotkin, and Faith Willinger _ are all
well-known authorities on Italian food, all fluent in Italian, all
so well versed in the history and culture of Italy that guidebooks
are superfluous when they're around.
</P>
<P>
   Behr tried to prepare for the trip. He has a good ear for
languages, he says, and, hoping to be able to keep up with his
illustrious companions, he listened to Italian language tapes.
</P>
<P>
   It helped his Italian, but not his self-confidence. ``I was
intimidated by Fred,'' says Behr, ``who spoke perfect Italian, by
Carol, whose name I knew very well, and by Nancy, who was a
journalist.''
</P>
<P>
   They must not have noticed. Behr was embraced by the group,
which named itself ``La Banda'' and went on to travel together many
more times. Books produced by members of the group invariably
credit ``La Banda'' followed by a list of first names, reading
something like: ``Carol, Corby, Faith, Fred, and Ed.''
</P>
<P>
   So Ed Behr passed muster. Now he knows many of the major food
professionals in this country and Europe. But a decade into his
newsletter, which goes to 3,000 subscribers (most of whom renew
faithfully every year), Behr is relatively unknown. Such devotion
and mystery inspires curiosity. Who is Ed Behr? He hears this
question all the time. New readers ask ``Why haven't I heard of you
before?'' Behr attributes his anonymity to his isolation in the
Northeast Kingdom, to the fact that word-of-mouth spreads slowly _
it was only recently that he had a piddling 1,000 subscribers _ and
to the idea that he writes and publishes ``a small, eccentric''
newsletter. ``I'm quirky,'' says Behr. ``I have an audience who
demands depth and accuracy. I'm writing more than most editors
think their readers want.''
</P>
<P>
   If you read Ed Behr (no one calls his newsletter by its real
name), you have paid $36 for four issues, each 32 pages of
advertising-free writing on a single subject, printed on very
high-quality paper, about topics like Sauternes, the sweet white
wine from Bordeaux; dry-aged steak, for which he bought and ate
several _ and wasn't knocked out; the caves of Roquefort, where the
famous blue-veined cheese has been made for some 500 years; and
Catalan cooking as it is found in and around Barcelona. Behr has a
straightforward way of presenting his information, which is well
reported _ he doesn't write extensively about anything he hasn't
visited _ and descriptive in the most appealing way. He writes the
kind of intellectual, thoughtful pieces you would expect to read in
The New Yorker if it regularly covered food.
</P>
<P>
   ``I love this guy because he gets interested in a topic and
devotes a whole issue to it,'' says Chris Kimball, publisher of
Cook's Illustrated magazine, another publication without
advertising. ``He could care less about cover notes, entertaining
his readers, or providing vicarious thrills to make them renew. If
you want an in-depth look, it's one-of-a-kind stuff. He's not
pandering to anybody but his own curiosity.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
----- &QC; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   To report, Behr sometimes uses Italian, which he gets along in
now. He is also fluent in French. People have told him that they
think he prefers Italy to France, which isn't true, but he does
like Italians. ``The Italians are so much more fun than the
French,'' he says. ``If you wanted a fun party, would you invite
the French? No. You'd invite them if you wanted an interesting,
cerebral party.''
</P>
<P>
   He understands both cultures through their land. He isn't afraid
to get on the road and roll up his sleeves to see agriculture at
its roots. As you travel with him, you get what he gets. In the
case of Roquefort, for instance, Behr went to the sheep farms where
the cheese is made. You can picture the hills and valleys, hear the
difference in dialect (when someone offers thanks, the other person
says ``with pleasure,'' rather than the usual ``it's nothing''),
and understand the passion of people who have made the same product
for so long that when they notice cheeses becoming oval from
sitting on their sides, they are distraught. The cheese should be
round, and it won't be accepted at market.
</P>
<P>
   In Catalonia, Behr went in search of calcots, which are pungent
onions set on a grid and cooked over vine prunings. ``The sweet
calcots blacken rapidly and they are turned once,'' writes Behr.
``The grid is quickly taken from the fire before the calcots are
hopelessly charred. Then they are tightly packed in the concave
side of an old clay roof tile. For half an hour they cook through
by their own heat. The clay tile bearing calcots arrives steaming
at the table. They should be so hot they almost burn your fingers.
You take one and search the black top for the pale green inner
leaves. You hold them tightly and with the other hand slide off the
charred sheath.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
----- &QC; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Behr will have you running to your grill to reproduce the
Catalan onions. He undoubtedly understands the hard-working
farmers, cooks, and winemakers he meets partly because his own
life, by choice, isn't that removed from theirs. Of course he's
writing instead of tending sheep or cooking outdoors, but the
setting isn't dissimilar, and neither is his rather spartan way of
life.
</P>
<P>
   He lives in a two-story white clapboard New England house in one
of the southernmost towns of the Northeast Kingdom, a house he
designed himself _ he was a carpenter before he became a writer.
Barnet, he says, which is located in the county of Caledonia, isn't
on everyone's map of the Northeast Kingdom. Some locals,
apparently, don't recognize this county. Barnet ``doesn't have the
trailer grittiness that some towns have,'' he says. ``A generation
has died, and enormous numbers have moved in from outside. At one
time a majority of the buildings were old. Now a majority are
new.''
</P>
<P>
   Behr, 49, is one of the newcomers, though he's been in the
region ``more than half my life.'' He came to New England to attend
Phillips Exeter Academy for his last year of high school. He had
been at Bethesda-Chevy Chase High School outside Washington, D. C.,
when he began doing ``hippie revolutionary things'' and was shipped
north. He was indifferent to academics back then and attended
Hamilton College, which he thinks accepted him because his
great-grandfather went there, and then Bennington College.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was a poor student and very lazy,'' he says over a
French-style midday dinner at his home. ``Now I'm a good student
who is not lazy at all.''
</P>
<P>
   He's also a self-conscious but capable home cook who makes
honest, simple dishes. He begins lunch for visitors with Spanish
Arbequina olives, ``one of the great underappreciated olives,''
then warm bread, or what he calls ``reheated bread, just to give it
the illusion of freshness.'' A bowl of his own small turnips is
drizzled with olive oil, and a delicious roast pork dish,
reinvented from a meal he made earlier in the week, is surrounded
by caramelized onions. There is also salad, tossed with a dressing
made from his own vinegar, Vermont Brie, and finally roasted
peaches with soft whipped cream.
</P>
<P>
   He is almost too serious about the quality of every single
ingredient, worrying about whether the bread is OK and the pork has
enough taste. ``I tried to buy the fattiest cut because it means it
may come from a local producer,'' he says. He has already put away
a bowl of roasted eggplant he began preparing because he decided it
wasn't good enough to serve.

 FORT WORTH, Texas: lot of attention.'' 
<TEXT>
<P>
   There, Love also developed a few dishes that eventually would
make it onto the Lonesome Dove's menu, such as the sesame-crusted
king salmon, served here with jalapeno honey stir-fried vegetables,
and the barbecue duck spring rolls, which he made with lobster in
Colorado. And he began learning about wine, which would help when
he had to devise the bistro's wine list.
</P>
<P>
   By the spring of '98, however, he and Emilie, who had begun
dating after she began working as manager at the restaurant in
Colorado, were ready to move. They traveled to Fort Worth to take
jobs at Mira Vista Country Club. Eventually, he ended up at Reata,
Emilie at Del Frisco's. But Tim already wanted to own his own
place.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was always looking'' at restaurant sites, Emilie recalls.
``He's the more adventuresome one. I was like, we have good jobs at
the two premier restaurants in town. Why do we want to risk that?''
</P>
<P>
   Then came the tornado that shut Reata down for more than six
weeks. Tim Love had spotted the empty space on North Main Street,
formerly home to a western-wear store and a short-lived oyster bar.
With Reata out of commission temporarily, the Loves took it as a
sign from God. On April 21, they signed a deal and set an opening
date for June.
</P>
<P>
   Doing much of the work themselves, they set about creating a
restaurant nearly from scratch. It got crazy; they ordered their
chairs off the Internet at 3 in the morning and sweated out whether
they'd be delivered on time.
</P>
<P>
   But the result is pleasing. The cozy interior, with its soaring
copper-toned tin ceiling, is split by a long wooden rail, with a
long wooden bar with high-backed Mexican iron barstools on one side
and dining tables on the other. The three bold cowboy-inspired
paintings were commissioned from a local artist; there are nice
small touches, like tiny silver salt cellars from Mexico, set on
each table.
</P>
<P>
   Just as important is the menu; Tim Love wanted to serve dishes
beyond the typical Southwestern pastiche, combining influences like
the Asian, French, and German cuisines that also played a part in
the West. That's how he came up with such specialties as the duck
spring rolls, served with sweet hoison and spicy garlic dipping
sauces; seared sweet lobster cakes, topped with a dollop of
cilantro-orange butter sauce; and a garlic-stuffed tenderloin,
served over a hash of cabbage and potatoes and a side of asparagus,
all the flavors carefully selected to mesh.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a different kind of place for the Stockyards, but really
it's the same thing, just fancier,'' says Stockyards entrepreneur
Steve Murrin, who co-owns the building. ``Everybody that I've taken
there has felt it was just an absolutely unexpected bonus, so much
better than they expected, just a top-quality place.''
</P>
<P>
   The restaurant's long-term success could be considered a bit of
a gamble, however, especially by those who remember the
difficulties traditionally faced by unusual restaurants in that
area.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would think it would be very difficult to have something
other than barbecue, Tex-Mex or a steakhouse work down there,''
says longtime local restaurateur Sally Bolick, who consulted on the
short-lived Panther City Brewery, an upscale, Southwestern-flavored
brewpub/restaurant that lasted about a year in the Stockyards in
1996-97.
</P>
<P>
   Bolick, who is now co-owner of Just Catering in Fort Worth, says
diners would come in before a concert at Billy Bob's or after
roaming the shops of the Stockyards and often seemed puzzled or
turned off by the eclectic menu.
</P>
<P>
   ``Anything that was the least bit unfamiliar was really a tough
sell down there,'' she says.
</P>
<P>
   But that was three years ago; Fort Worth's restaurant scene has
grown more diverse and sophisticated in even that short a time
span. And Panther City was a big place, one that needed tourists
and a steady weekday business to survive.
</P>
<P>
   Lonesome Dove, on the other hand, seats only 52, plus another
few dozen along the long, handsome bar. The Loves have made sure to
cozy up to their neighbors, offering $5 lunch specials for locals
and buying supplies and decor items from nearby merchants. And,
wisely, they close on Sundays and Mondays and serve dinner only
Thursday-Saturday; this gives them open days to host lucrative
private parties. They also provide valet parking, a service that
allays the worst of a visit to the Stockyards _ finding a place to
stable the car.
</P>
<P>
   Eventually, the couple would like to open two to four additional
restaurants. But they plan to follow the same formula _ serve good
food, play good music, keep it small _ and have fun.
</P>
<P>
   ``I love that I may work hard all day behind the scenes, but
when it's 5 o'clock, I'm just having a party and all these people
are coming in and we get to serve them dinner,'' Emilie. ``That's
really all it is, we're just having a really big dinner party every
night.''

<P>
   FORT WORTH, Texas _ Elsewhere in the Stockyards on a Friday
night, the main attractions are the rodeo, or a sale at one of the
western-wear stores, or maybe the line dancers taking the floor at
Billy Bob's. But inside the Lonesome Dove Western Bistro, a new
white-tablecloth restaurant a block south of Exchange Avenue, the
kitchen is the star of the show.
</P>
<P>
   Wearing a dishwasher's snap-front shirt, baggy chef pants and a
cowboy hat, and working in an open space smaller than many home
kitchens, owner-chef Tim Love is cooking up western-tinged dishes
like grilled quail quesadillas, sweet lobster cakes with black-bean
salsa, and red corn-crusted halibut for a full house of 50.
Assisted by only a dishwasher and, on busy nights like this one, a
line cook, he is everywhere: searing steaks, blackening fish,
garnishing appetizers, dressing salads, plating desserts. He
touches every plate that goes out.
</P>
<P>
   This is exactly the kind of restaurant that Tim Love and his
wife, Emilie, wanted to open: a personal, friendly spot, with a
decor that is cowboy-flavored yet sophisticated, serving up
eclectic fare influenced by, but not limited to, Southwestern
cuisine.
</P>
<P>
   But one has to ask: Will white bean cassoulet with duck, lamb
and quail, barbecue-duck spring rolls, and sesame-crusted king
salmon play in the Stockyards, more often known as the destination
for Tex-Mex and barbecue?
</P>
<P>
   So far, the answer seems to be, boy howdy.
</P>
<P>
   Open since early June, Lonesome Dove has been packing them in,
running a full house most weekend nights. It's been busy enough
that Emilie Love, who'd planned to keep her managment job at Del
Frisco's steak house downtown, was able to quit there in mid-July
to work at Lonesome Dove full time. And Southern Living has already
dropped by, for a feature to run this fall.
</P>
<P>
   The food, by and large, is excellent _ hearty yet sophisticated.
That it is coming from a 28-year-old chef, a first-time restaurant
owner who put together the deal in less than two months, is
surprising only if you don't know him, friends say.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's a really talented guy, a really hard-working guy,'' says
Grady Spears, the star chef of Fort Worth's famed Reata, who hired
Love as a kitchen manager a couple of years ago. Love worked there
until he left to begin work on Lonesome Dove in April. ``And the
food's good. Tim's always been good with food.''
</P>
<P>
   Um, well, not always. Growing up north of Fort Worth in Denton,
where his mom lived, and spending summers at his dad's farm in
Cookville, Tenn., Love didn't pay a lot of attention to food or
cooking. Then, when he was 18 and needed a job to help pay his way
through college, he applied for a position as a waiter at a popular
Greek restaurant in Knoxville. He was hired him to make salads
instead.
</P>
<P>
   That would have been OK, except the guy who was supposed to
train him didn't show up the first day and Love was plunged into
the dinner rush, not even knowing what was supposed to go on the
Greek salads that a supervisor was screaming for him to make.
Somehow, he figured out how to throw together the right combination
of feta cheese, kalamata olives and tomatoes and made it through
his shift. And he was hooked on cooking.
</P>
<P>
   ``I loved it,'' he recalls. ``I loved how it was either you act
or you get buried. I loved the kitchen.''
</P>
<P>
   Over the next few years, Love rose quickly, becoming a kitchen
manager and sous-chef at various Knoxville restaurants while
carrying a full load of classes. By the time he had his degree in
finance, he'd already been the chef for a Radisson hotel that then
wanted to send him to the Culinary Institute of America for a year
of intensified courses.
</P>
<P>
   He went, but afterward, burned out from so many 80- and 100-hour
weeks, he moved to Colorado and took a job cooking hamburgers and
pizzas in a Breckenridge bar. For two years, he mostly snowboarded
and skied, until he met Breckenridge restaurateur Wayne Spaulding
playing foosball in a bar one night. Spaulding owned one successful
restaurant in town and wanted to open another; Love came on board
as a cook and soon became the Uptown Bistro's chef.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's where I really got back into food,'' Love says.
Spaulding ``let me do anything I wanted. We brought in truffles, we
brought in fresh lobsters, we ordered John Dory. We wanted to be
the premier place in town, and we got a lot of attention.''

<TEXT>
<P>
   CAMDEN, Maine _ Alice Chalifoux, the 92-year-old teacher of some
of the world's best harpists, paused midthrow recently to offer
some insights that come after so many years. She held a Frisbee in
her right hand, while her dog Patch stood at her feet awaiting the
toss like a coiled spring.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't dwell on failures,'' she said. ``I'm able to close
doors, open new ones.'' That said, she launched Frisbee and dog
into the crisp morning air of Penobscot Bay, then walked briskly
toward a breakfast of warm blueberry muffins and a day full of
students eager to open new doors.
</P>
<P>
   Chalifoux directs the Salzedo Harp Colony, a 59-year-old New
England institution that brings 54 harpists to the Camden area each
summer to study with her. Mind you, she is Miss, not Ms.,
Chalifoux. Nor is she Mrs. Rideout (her late husband, John Rideout,
died a half-century ago). She's ``miss'' because this is how a
proper young lady just out of an Alabama convent school was
addressed when she joined the Cleveland Symphony as the principal
harpist in 1931.
</P>
<P>
   But she is no milquetoast playing the instrument of angels. The
tiny harpist who still speaks with a hint of Alabama could hold her
own with the coarsest of Maine loggers _ with whom she would be
happy to hoist a glass if the invitation were extended. The
``miss'' has stuck, but the southern-belle propriety was cast off
during her first year with the symphony when Chalifoux countered
the chauvinism of the almost-all-male orchestra with language she
never learned from the nuns. It was particularly useful in showing
her displeasure when she had to use her harp case as a lockerroom,
since most symphony halls provided changing rooms for men only.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everyone was expecting this mousy, quiet girl,'' said Ann
Hobson Pilot, a former student and the principal harpist for the
Boston Symphony Orchestra. ``They got something quite, quite
different.''
</P>
<P>
   In fact, they got someone whose students now play principal harp
in three of the five leading orchestras in the nation _ Boston,
Cleveland, and Philadelphia, according to professional musicians.
</P>
<P>
   ``Miss Chalifoux teaches by inspiring. She draws it out of you
because she works so hard. You don't take a lesson from her and
futz around,'' said Douglas Rioth, who plays the first harp for the
San Francisco Symphony. How much does he value her today? Rioth
will be a guest performer at Tanglewood on Aug. 13, and said he'll
play such a challenging piece that he plans to swing through Camden
first for a brush-up lesson from Chalifoux.
</P>
<P>
   Sarah Ericsson is another student. Eight years a member of the
Boston Symphony Orchestra, Ericsson resigned two years ago to start
a solo harp career.
</P>
<P>
   ``She makes a complete commitment to her students. She is a shot
of vitamin B12, always helping take the harp to another level,''
Ericsson said.
</P>
<P>
   When Chalifoux was growing up in Birmingham, Ala., the harp _
introduced to her by her mother _ was considered a piece of angelic
parlor furniture, more music box than serious instrument.
</P>
<P>
   Then along came Carlos Salzedo, a French harpist who moved to
Philadelphia in the 1920s to write some of the first music designed
specifically for the harp. He also bought a small house in Camden,
where he invited promising students to take lessons each summer.
Salzedo's pieces required players not to just pluck the strings,
but to pull them for greater volume and range. It became known as
the Salzedo Technique, and Chalifoux was one of his youngest
students.
</P>
<P>
   For the decades that followed, Chalifoux studied with Salzedo _
then taught with him, eventually inheriting the nonprofit Harp
Colony in 1961 while continuing to play with the Cleveland
Symphony, raise a daughter, and teach music at two Ohio institutes.
</P>
<P>
   Today she lives with her daughter's family in Virginia, spending
the three summer months in Camden. She has retired from all
professional responsibilities except for teaching in the shingle
house at the end of Marine Street.
</P>
<P>
   The Camden house is decorated in the art deco style of Salzedo's
day. Except for a harp, about the only other object that makes any
noise in the house is an old Zenith AM radio. Chalifoux doesn't
come here to tend house, to vacation, to shop for Down East
knickknacks, to sail aboard aboard a Camden schooner.
</P>
<P>
   She comes here to work.
</P>
<P>
   Chalifoux has a shock of white hair; her hands are arthritic,
but still able to bang out chords on the harp. And she is small; 5
feet would be generous. Because she looks through her car's
steering wheel, not over it, folks hereabouts say they know she is
in town when they see her blue Buick Century station wagon cruising
down Main Street with no one in it.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can't afford an accident. They'll take my license away. And
I won't be able to apply for another one until I'm 95,'' Chalifoux
explained the other day between lessons. She gives seven a day,
about 550 lessons a summer. Students travel around the world to
learn from her, bringing video cameras to tape sessions for further
study back home. She charges $75 per lesson.
</P>
<P>
   ``Of course I could make more money,'' she said. ``But what am I
going to do with it?''
</P>
<P>
   Students say that one of her greatest skills is zeroing in
immediately on the ability of a player, then advancing it a notch.
Melissa Tardiff, 23, from Salisbury, Md., had just completed a
session with Chalifoux. Jillian Jones, 14, of Wichita, Kan., was
next.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now let's start with some exercises,'' Chalifoux instructed.
``Right hand . . . beautiful! Nice hand position. . . . Now the
left hand . . . louder, dear, sock'em more . . . ba-ba-BING!''
</P>
<P>
   Chalifoux was up and down in her wicker chair, plucking notes,
then pushing Jones to do the same. There did not seem to be time
for the girl to breathe, much less make the corrections, but the
elder woman continued to smother the younger woman with
instructions _ and Jones stayed with her, the girl's mother and
grandmother watching from seats against one wall of the living
room, exhausted just listening to the pace of instruction.
</P>
<P>
   When the lesson ended and the trio left, Chalifoux offered this:
``That Jillian's a smart girl. She can take it.''
</P>
<P>
   It was 4 p.m., another lesson was on deck, but Chalifoux
appeared more charged than ever, as if she had just opened another
door a bit wider.

DEAF WORKER'S SUIT PUTS SPOTLIGHT ON LAW'S IMPACT 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DIANE E. WHITE  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR; Without intending to, John ``Skip'' Sprague has become a bit
of a celebrity.
</P>
<P>
   Sprague's lawsuit against United Airlines, which is now in the
hands of a Boston federal court judge, focused a hard, bright light
on the employment concerns of people with disabilities.
</P>
<P>
   Final arguments in the case were heard on Wednesday, about 10
years after the passage of the Americans with Disabilities Act.
</P>
<P>
   In the days since the trial began, Sprague v. United Airlines
has been the talk of the city, garnering attention on local radio
and television stations and in the print media.
</P>
<P>
   Sprague, a 38-year-old licensed pilot and aircraft engine
mechanic with more than 16 years of experience, alleges the airline
discriminated against him when it offered him a job three years ago
and then rescinded the offer because it felt his deafness would
impede his performance and compromise his safety.
</P>
<P>
   A company spokesman, reached last week at United's headquarters
in Chicago, declined to comment. ``Until there is a final
disposition on the case, we do not make it a practice of
commenting,'' Chris Brathwaite said.
</P>
<P>
   Talk to Sprague about the case and he will tell you that prior
to this experience, he had never been turned down for work because
of his deafness. By all accounts, his lengthy work experience,
personal knowledge of flying, college degree, and adeptness at sign
language and lip reading had played a role in helping him bridge
the enormous chasm between the hearing and nonhearing world.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, Sprague had hardly any reason to worry until 1997, the
year United said, ``No.''
</P>
<P>
   ``That was difficult for him,'' said Jane Alper, a senior
attorney at the Disability Law Center in Boston and one of
Sprague's lawyers. ``He was upset and angry. He had worked hard,
had gotten the job, and then the company changed its mind because
of his disability. It was devastating, and it was a violation'' of
the Americans with Disabilities Act.
</P>
<P>
   After turning Sprague down for the first position, United
offered him another job as a shop mechanic at its San Francisco
site. Thinking that job would lead to a transfer to Logan Airport
and the position he had sought initially, Sprague accepted and, for
15 months, commuted weekly between Massachusetts and California to
be with his wife and two daughters, all of whom are also deaf.
</P>
<P>
   ``Prior to this, I was aware of a few other situations in which
people had experienced the same thing, but I felt lucky that I was
not one of them,'' Sprague said in sign language through an
interpreter. ``Then, it happened to me and it was a shocking and
hurtful experience.''
</P>
<P>
   Trim and athletic looking, Sprague's hands moved rapidly in
response to a reporter's questions. Although the hearing aids he
wears in both ears have brought some sound into his life, it is not
enough to distinguish words.
</P>
<P>
   Standing in the lobby of the federal courthouse, Sprague paused
to confer with his wife, Susan, who later recalled that her
husband's 15-month bicoastal commute was particularly trying on
their two young daughters. ``It was a struggle for the kids not
seeing their father much that year,'' she signed. ``And it hurt him
to see that they were growing but he couldn't be there.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It is good for disabled people to see what I have been
through,'' noted Sprague. ``I didn't file the lawsuit for myself. I
did it for others, including my two daughters, who are deaf.''
</P>
<P>
   Whatever the outcome, the case has focused attention on the
Americans with Disabilities Act during a period of intense debate
over its impact on employment, transportation, housing, and society
as a whole. In 1990, when advocates first celebrated the law's
passage, many assumed the measure would pave the way to full
acceptance of people with disabilities.
</P>
<P>
   More than anything, they hoped it would level a one-two punch
against the physical and social barriers that have prevented many
of the nation's 54 million disabled citizens from leading full
lives.
</P>
<P>
   Fashioned in the shadow of the Civil Rights Act, the measure was
expected to break down stereotypes, build acceptance, and increase
mobility by prompting the use of various accommodations by public
and private entities.
</P>
<P>
   In the end, the reasoning went, public policy changes would help
eradicate stigma in a country where youth and physical perfection
are revered. Now, a decade later, some advocates are wondering
whether their expectations were too heightened or simply naive.
</P>
<P>
   The soul-searching has been all the more intense in this era of
low unemployment, high production, and increased demand for skilled
workers.
</P>
<P>
   ``Even in this boom economy, there is a seething discontent
within the disability community that they are not getting their
fair chance at the American dream,'' noted John D. Kemp, senior
vice president for strategic development at HalfthePlanet.com, a
Web site that links people with disabilities to services.
</P>
<P>
   When New York-based Louis Harris and Associates polled 1,000
people with disabilities aged 16 and older in the spring of 1998,
it found a 71 percent jobless rate among people with disabilities,
5 percentage points higher than recorded in 1986 when the firm
started tracking the employment data.
</P>
<P>
   ``Right now, people are being pushed into a humiliating and
dependent lifestyle and yet they want to work,'' said Kemp, who was
on the White House lawn when the disabilities act was signed into
law. Today, he is a member of the National Council on Disabilities.
Composed of 15 presidential appointees, its members advise Congress
and the president on disability policies.
</P>
<P>
   ``Many people are not applying for jobs because they are afraid
of losing their medical benefits,'' he said. ``They know that if
the job they take doesn't work out and they go off the medical
benefits rolls, it will take nine months to regain those
benefits.''
</P>
<P>
   One bit of good news: legislation cosponsored by Massachusetts
Senator Edward M. Kennedy, a Democrat, and James M. Jeffords, a
Republican from Vermont. Known as the Work Incentives Improvement
Act, the measure is supposed to revise current laws so that
disabled people can work. Prior to the law's passage, those who
earned up to $700 per month risked losing insurance and federal
cash payments.
</P>
<P>
   The new law not only includes a provision for training, it
raises the monthly earnings cap. But there is one drawback: It will
take years before each state implements the law. Kemp said another
failing of the system is that employers do not actively recruit
people with disabilities. ``I doubt that most US firms have any
knowledgeable people on their staffs who can identify people with
disabilities who are willing and able to work,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Kemp, who recently recalled the zeal with which he supported the
disabilites act in 1990, can't hide his disappointment. He had
hoped for more significant changes. Instead, he said,
discriminatory and stereotypical attitudes toward the disabled
persist. ``It will take a whole lot longer than I ever wanted to
believe. I had thought, in my own work lifetime, that we would be
farther than we are now.''
</P>
<P>
   Now 50, Kemp has worn artificial limbs since age 2. A middle
child whose siblings did not have a disability, Kemp says he was
raised to believe that work would always be a part of his life.
</P>
<P>
   ``Basically, my father gave me the wherewithal to make my way in
the world,'' he said. ``He realized that attitudinal barriers were
bigger than anything else. So, I spent a lot of time making other
people comfortable.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, it wasn't easy. When Kemp was a freshman at Georgetown
University in Washington, a professor humiliated him in front of
his classmates. ``He indicated that I had no business in his
classroom, and he said I was wasting his time and my time,'' he
recalled. ``I could have complained, but I had learned to a certain
extent to be quiet. I felt honored to just be there, and I was
overwhelmed. So, I took it in stride the way a lot of people with
disabilities do and I shut up.''
</P>
<P>
   John Sprague seriously considered shutting up too, but his
family wouldn't let him. And, unlike Kemp's experience some 30
years ago, Sprague could rely on the Americans with Disabilities
Act.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I applied at United, I had 15 years' experience working
on planes, but they did not recognize it,'' Sprague said.
</P>
<P>
   ``All they saw was a deaf person.''

WHERE THE POLITICIANS INVEST THEIR MONEY 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (f and p coding)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DOLORES KONG  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR; If money talks, then what the presidential candidates have in
their investment portfolios may speak volumes.
</P>
<P>
   Vice President Al Gore _ who once claimed to have invented the
Internet and considers himself an environmentalist _ has no
Internet securities, just some oil stock in his father's estate,
and a zinc mine that's leased out. Otherwise, he's in plain-vanilla
cash and real estate, saying he refrains from stock and mutual fund
ownership to avoid conflict of interest.
</P>
<P>
   Texas Governor George W. Bush owns Big Oil, of course, but he
also has held shares in Compaq, a gold mining company, and the
Texas Rangers baseball team. He's owned Microsoft, the target of
federal antitrust action. And Bush himself has been investigated
for possible insider trading, for a 1990 sale of oil stock just
before the firm reported losses, but no action was ever taken.
</P>
<P>
   Reform Party candidate Patrick J. Buchanan is as conservative in
his investments as he is in his politics, with nearly half of his
millions in cash and bonds. He's also the only candidate who owns
gold and other precious metals, more than $250,000 worth. Despite
his objections to the North American Free Trade Agreement, he holds
shares in a firm that supported the pact.
</P>
<P>
   And Green Party nominee Ralph Nader, famous for his proconsumer,
anticorporate stance, is also a capitalist, with more than $1
million worth of Cisco, and millions in cash, Fidelity funds, and
other high-tech firms. He says he regrets not owning stock in the
Washington Post Co., up more than tenfold since the 1970s, so he'd
have more profits for ``consumer and other civic initiatives that
its newspaper too rarely covers.''
</P>
<P>
   These and other gleanings from the candidates' latest personal
financial disclosures and other public information provide extra
insight into the men who would be president: How do they manage
their money, and what might that say about their personality and
how they might govern?
</P>
<P>
   ``I'd certainly be a lot more comfortable with someone who
understood the new economy rather than with someone who understood
gold, in a position of leadership,'' said psychologist Richard
Geist, president of the Newton-based Institute of Psychology and
Investing.

<P>
   ``If you believe that the new economy is here to stay, then
you'd have to believe that Nader is in tune with the times,'' Geist
said. ``Gold has been an extremely poorly performing asset class
for the last 10 years . . . so you'd have to ask why someone is
sticking with that now.''
</P>
<P>
   Geist didn't find much in the portfolio of Bush or Gore to sway
votes or make them the envy of stockpickers everywhere.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think there's any differentiating factor in terms of
whether to vote for someone or not,'' he said of the candidates'
holdings.
</P>
<P>
   So as the Republican Party kicks off its convention in
Philadelphia this week, with the Reform Party following suit in
Long Beach, Calif., and the Democratic Party in Los Angeles, in
August, it seems worthwhile not only to listen to what the
candidates say on the stump, but to look at what they do with their
money.
</P>
<P>
   --Gore: With a family net worth between $1.1 million and $2.5
million, the Democrat is the ``poorest'' of the presidential
candidates and has the most humdrum portfolio, according to a Globe
analysis of the latest personal financial disclosure forms. The
candidates need only value their assets in a broad range on the
forms.
</P>
<P>
   The only publicly traded asset listed by Gore is Occidental
Petroleum, worth between $500,000 and $1 million, in his late
father's estate. But Gore's spokesmen said that doesn't conflict
with the vice president's environmental advocacy.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's listed on his form, but he actually doesn't own the
stock,'' said Jim Kennedy, communications director for the vice
president's office. ``It was in his father's estate and is now in a
trust for his mother.'' As executor of his father's estate and a
potential beneficiary of the trust, Gore was required to list the
stock as an asset, Kennedy said. Gore is no longer a trustee of the
estate and ``doesn't have the ability to sell it or order that it
be sold,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The other Gore asset that may raise eyebrows with
environmentalists: A zinc mine that's leased out and worth between
$100,000 and $250,000, according to the candidate's personal
financial disclosure form filed in May.
</P>
<P>
   Douglas Hattaway, national spokesman for the Gore presidential
campaign, said the vice president bought the land and mineral lease
from his father, and his ownership of it does not contradict his
environmental positions.
</P>
<P>
   ``My understanding is the mine has met all environmental
regulations,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The rest of the Gore family's assets is in cash, individual
retirement accounts, Virginia and Tennessee real estate, a real
estate S corporation, and the children's trusts.
</P>
<P>
   And no high-flying tech stocks or mutual funds for the man who
once claimed to have invented the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   ``The vice president has chosen not to make investments in
stocks or mutual funds, and he has done so not because of any
requirement of law, but in order to avoid even the appearance of
any potential conflicts,'' said Kennedy. ``That's the course he's
chosen as vice president.''
</P>
<P>
   --Bush: The Republican is the richest of the presidential
candidates, with a family net worth of between $11.1 million and
$29.4 million, according to the personal financial disclosure he
filed this year.
</P>
<P>
   Concerns about conflict of interest apparently haven't kept Bush
from owning shares at some point in such companies as Microsoft, BP
Amoco, Baxter International, Ford, and other big businesses.
</P>
<P>
   Although the disclosure form reports Bush has sold shares in
these and about two dozen other publicly traded companies, it lists
dividends and capital gains of between $33,000 and $90,000 being
received from these firms during the reporting period.
</P>
<P>
   A campaign spokesman said he believed the shares were sold by
Bush's blind trust, although he didn't know details. Such trusts
are sometimes used by elected officials to avoid concerns about
conflicts of interest, since officials theoretically don't know
what the trusts buy, sell, or hold.
</P>
<P>
   The Texas governor still owns more than $12,000 worth of Cabot
Oil &AMP; Gas Corp. in his IRA, however, according to the disclosure
form.
</P>
<P>
   Bush's most profitable investment was his $600,000 stake in the
Texas Rangers in 1989. When the team was sold in 1998 _ after Bush
helped persuade taxpayers to finance a new stadium, thus boosting
the team's value _ his share was worth about $15 million, according
to public reports.
</P>
<P>
   And his most questionable investment was in 1990, when he sold
some of his shares in Harken Energy for a profit, just weeks before
the company announced multimillion-dollar losses. Bush, a director
and consultant to the company as a result of Harken's merger with a
failing oil exploration firm he founded, said he sold the shares to
pay down the loan he took out for the Rangers and didn't know about
the company's financial problems at the time. The Securities and
Exchange Commission investigated Bush for possible insider trading,
but took no action against him.
</P>
<P>
   --Buchanan: In the disclosure he filed more than a week ago,
after the Federal Election Commission sent him a letter by
certified mail about his missing the May deadline, Buchanan listed
a family net worth of between $5.2 million and $16.1 million,
including assets held in PJB Enterprises, an employee benefit trust
for him, his wife, and one employee, and a recent inheritance.
</P>
<P>
   About 40 percent of his net worth is in cash or cash equivalents
and municipal or corporate bonds, and he has between $250,000 and
$500,000 in gold, silver, and other precious metals. He owns rental
properties in Maryland and Washington, D.C., worth between $650,000
and $1.5 million, and a personal residence in McLean, Va., that's
valued between $1 million and $5 million.
</P>
<P>
   Buchanan also holds between $180,000 and $565,000 in such stocks
as AT&AMP;T, SBC Communications, Lucent Technologies, El Paso Energy
Corp., Bell Atlantic (now Verizon), and Burlington Resources,
according to the disclosure form.
</P>
<P>
   But while Buchanan has said that the ``elitist architects'' of
NAFTA ``have locked arms with their corporate cohorts to support a
trade policy that is neither fair nor free,'' according to campaign
information, at least one of his corporate holdings, AT&AMP;T, pushed
for the pact, according to company information.
</P>
<P>
   K. B. Forbes, communications director for Buchanan, said: ``Mr.
Buchanan has never invested in AT&AMP;T. It was a gift from his
father-in-law over 20 years ago, and it's in his and his wife's
name.''
</P>
<P>
   Aside from that, Forbes said, the campaign's policy is to ``let
the report speak for itself,'' and declined to comment further on
the candidate's personal financial disclosure.
</P>
<P>
   --Nader: Famous for his gadfly campaigns, Nader is also
well-known for his frugal lifestyle _ he doesn't own a car, he
doesn't own a house or condo, and he wears a limited wardrobe.
</P>
<P>
   But he's been secretive about his personal finances _ until now.
In the financial disclosure form required of presidential
candidates, which he filed last month after being granted an
extension, Nader discloses assets worth $4.09 million to $4.96
million.
</P>
<P>
   His biggest individual stock holding is in networking company
Cisco Systems, worth $1.16 million in early June. But Nader also
owns other tech-related holdings _ between $15,000 and $50,000 each
of ACTV (interactive TV and TV-on-demand maker), Fibercore (a
Charlton-based optical fiber maker), and Iomega (computer drive
maker), and between $50,000 and $100,000 each of networking company
3Com, publisher Ziff-Davis, and electronic design product supplier
Cadence Design.
</P>
<P>
   He also has a couple of Fidelity funds: between $50,000 and
$100,000 in the OTC fund, and between $100,000 and $250,000 in
Magellan. But most of his holdings are in cash and cash
equivalents, between $2.59 million and $3 million.
</P>
<P>
   While some may find Nader's stock ownership contrary to his
proconsumer, anticorporate stance, he explains in an addendum to
his disclosure form that he consistently gives away 50 percent of
his adjusted gross income to charities, and views his income and
profits as ``a de facto philanthropic fund for many projects and
institutions that serve the interests of consumers, the
environment, labor, and more accountable business and government.
In short, monies I earn are for strengthening civil society.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, his stock ownership didn't stop him from filing a
federal suit in Boston last month in the name of better government,
and counter to the interests of one of the companies he owns, 3Com.
In the suit in US District Court, Nader charged that the Federal
Election Commission is violating the law by allowing corporations,
including 3Com, to help underwrite the presidential debates, and
thus potentially influencing the campaign.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think that's an inconsistency,'' said a campaign
spokeswoman of Nader's stock ownership and the suit.
</P>
<P>
   Or perhaps the suit was motivated by the fact that Nader is
excluded from the debates, the first of which is scheduled for Oct.
3 at Boston's John F. Kennedy Library.

   GOP-BUSH (Philadelphia) _ Man in the News: Gov. George W. Bush
is almost an accidental candidate, a cocky and cheerful fellow who
drifted through much of his life and who was largely unknown in
America until he assumed his first political office five years ago.
Yet he now leads the polls and will become, if elected, the
president with the least experience in public service since Woodrow
Wilson was chosen in 1912. But there still is a great deal about
his beliefs and leadership style _ about the kind of president he
would be _ that remains unknown. By Nicholas D. Kristof and Frank

THE GUV LOVES MCGREGOR CAFE'S CHICKEN-FRIED STEAK

<TEXT>
<P>
   George W. Bush can load up on Philly cheesesteaks this week.
</P>
<P>
   But easy on the Cheez Whiz, Guv. Save those fat grams for the
cream gravy back home at the Citrano Bros. Coffee Shop Cafe.
</P>
<P>
   The name Citrano sounds as if it belongs on a cheesesteak stand.
Instead, it's on Bush's favorite home-cooking cafe, in a small town
close to his ranch in central Texas.
</P>
<P>
   The Citrano brothers _ Donald, 39, and Sammy, 44 _ own the
70-year-old landmark George's Restaurant in Waco, where young
adults from across Texas go for the legendary ``Big O,'' a frosty
18-ounce beer. For the Citranos' second venture, they bought a cafe
20 miles west in the town of McGregor.
</P>
<P>
   They had owned the cafe six months in April 1999 when a caller
warned, ``You're going to have Governor Bush in your restaurant in
30 minutes.''
</P>
<P>
   Now, he's a neighbor and a regular customer at the Coffee Shop,
1005 W. McGregor Drive.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're ecstatic. He brags on the chicken-fried steak and the
pies,'' Sammy Citrano said, adding with a laugh: ``We told him
we're so happy, we named our other restaurant after him.''
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps concerned for the future of the nation, Donald Citrano
has suggested that Bush try the pork chop with dressing, the
featured entree on the Sunday buffet. But the governor insists on
the chicken-fried steak.
</P>
<P>
   The Citranos had been counting on the old George's Restaurant to
make them famous. They just added a 150-seat ``George's `Big O'
Party Deck'' at their first restaurant, off Interstate 35 at 18th
Street in Waco. &QL;

convention-related stories for Thursday, Aug. 3. The New York Times
News Service will file the following stories and photos tonight in
the ``p'' news file. For repeats or information, call 888-346-9867

<P>
   GOP-RDP-NYT (Philadelphia) _ A convention roundup: Gov. George
W. Bush makes his calibrated entry into Philadelphia, when
delegates at the 37th Republican National Convention will select
him as their nominee for president. Bush and Dick Cheney are to
receive their party's official nominations tonight, and Cheney will
speak to the convention.
</P>
<P>
   (EDS: An early, 900-word version of the roundup is scheduled to
move by 3 p.m. ET and will be updated with a longer version written

<P>
   GOP-BUSH-NYT _ Man in the News profile: Just six years ago, when
George W. Bush ran for governor of Texas, even his own parents
expected him to lose; it was his younger brother Jeb who held the
family's confidence. Friends and family members say that the elder
Bushes worried that George W. would be forced to bow again, as he
had several times before, to failure. But that story had a surprise
ending: While Jeb lost, George won. And in the process, George
Walker Bush launched himself, without any grand plan or intricate
forethought, on a trajectory that on Thursday will place him in the
spotlight as the Republican nominee for president, continuing along
what historians may some day recall as one of the most remarkable
paths ever taken to the White House. By Nicholas D. Kristof and

   BILLY-JOEL-YACHT (Undated) _ Long before stepping into the
recording studio and racking up gold records, Billy Joel began his
nautical career by swimming out to other people's moorings off the
North Shore and ``borrowing'' their boats. He has owned many since
and now also lures other millionaires into the boater's morass with

   FILM-COMPOSER (New York) _ Sitting in his 5.1 Surround format
sound studio installed in his newly renovated apartment on Hudson
Street, Carter Burwell, a film composer, was talking about romantic
comedy. ``I find it the most difficult thing,'' Burwell, 44, said.
``People on screen are happy _ the music is happy. People are sad _
the music is sad. I prefer a more ironic approach. If people are
being killed on screen, then I can be carefree,'' he said, speaking
musically. Burwell's latest deadline is ``Blair Witch 2,'' to be
released on Halloween. The scrupulously spare 3,000 square foot
loft that Burwell shares with his wife, Christine Sciulli, a
lighting designer and video artist is a creative contradiction in
terms: it conceals over five miles of analog and digital audio,
video and Ethernet cable and eleven electronic patch boxes that
allow Burwell to compose in the peace of his own apartment _
anywhere from his studio to the bathroom tub. By William L.
Hamilton.

&HT;     SAN FRANCISCO LOOKS TO MAKE CITY'S STREETS SAFER 
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 &HT;     By RACHEL GORDON  
 &HT;     c.2000 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ San Francisco Supervisor Mabel Teng unveiled her
Top 10 list of ideas to make the streets safer for pedestrians,
including establishing a 24-hour hot line to report dangerous
intersections and installing speed bumps to slow down cars.
</P>
<P>
   Teng's proposals, unveiled Monday, are contained in a
comprehensive report on pedestrian safety that includes 105
recommendations that sprang from a special summit on the topic held
in May.
</P>
<P>
   Many of the suggestions in the report, such as banning the use
of cell phones while driving, banning right turns on red lights and
restricting vehicles on Market Street, are controversial. And none
made Teng's Top 10 list. The supervisor said she wanted to tackle
recommendations that were likely to win support first.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some can be easily adopted,'' Teng said of the total package
of recommendations. ``Some are thought-provoking and will require
additional public input and dialogue. Some will take longer-term
efforts before we see results.''
</P>
<P>
   ``In speaking with everyone involved, there seemed to be at
least 10 proposals that all groups support,'' she said, adding that
she would push for immediate implementation.
</P>
<P>
   She called the report a living document that would be reviewed
and amended as time went on. She already called for a formal update
in March.
</P>
<P>
   Teng said The City must move forward to combat its serious
pedestrian safety problem. Eighteen pedestrians have died in San
Francisco this year, with hundreds more seriously injured.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to the hot line and the speed bumps, Teng's
fast-track list includes:
</P>
<P>
   A citywide pedestrian safety advertising campaign that targets
drivers, bicyclists and pedestrians. In fact, the Goodby
Silverstein &AMP; Partners advertising firm, of ``Got Milk?'' fame, is
drawing up such a campaign aimed at the start of the new school
year.
</P>
<P>
   Increasing crossing times at all intersections with signals, an
effort
</P>
<P>
   already being undertaken by the Department of Parking and
Traffic.
</P>
<P>
   Making the signals red in both directions at dangerous
intersections for a brief interval to provide pedestrians a head
start crossing the street before traffic starts to flow.
</P>
<P>
   Installing more lighted sidewalks to make crosswalks more
visible and putting in countdown clocks at intersections with
traffic signals so people know how much time is left to safely
cross the street. Both programs are budgeted already, as are plans
for more traffic calming measures, such as speed bumps.
</P>
<P>
   Studying the connection between cell phone use and traffic
accidents. Supervisor Amos Brown already requested such a review.
</P>
<P>
   Funding a plan to make Market Street safer for pedestrians and
bicyclists.
</P>
<P>
   Replacing dull ``school crossing`` and ``senior crossing`` signs
with ones that are more visible, and erecting ``pedestrian
crossing`` signs at all intersections that do not have traffic
lights or stop signs.
</P>
<P>
   ``Supervisor Teng's Top 10 proposals for pedestrian safety will
go a long way toward making San Francisco's streets safer for all
users,'' said Leah Shahum, program director of the San Francisco
Bicycle Coalition.

 &HT;    Ho-hum effort no laughing matter
 &HT;    By Sonia Murray
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Maybe old material is a good thing to use for a new movie
(``Shaft'') or a hit Puff Daddy record, but not comedy.
</P>
<P>
   Five weeks after Elian Gonzalez flew back to Cuba with his
father, the 6-year-old's situation just doesn't resonate the same
way; nor does a reference to the 1993 movie ``Indecent Proposal.''
But TV comics Steve Harvey and D.L. Hughley, who kick off this
soundtrack to the movie that opens Aug. 18, actually try to mine
these faded moments for laughs.
</P>
<P>
   They would have been wise to follow Cedric ``The Entertainer''
and Bernie Mac's leads as they smartly spin forward topics like
what golf courses are like now that a lot of black, aspiring Tigers
are on the greens (``We're out there with wave caps on (our
heads),'' Cedric remarks playfully. ``Wearing Timbaland (boots)...
out there barbecuing.''). Or Mac, using Chris Rock's acerbic style
to find something funny in the struggle to raise a crack-addicted
relative's kids.
</P>
<P>
   The problem with the five songs that divide the comedians'
sketches isn't timeliness; it's sluggishness. Rap's Hot Boys
(Mannie Fresh, Baby, Juvenile, Lil' Wayne) perform ``1 Stunna'' and
``What's Up With That'' with no energy. Only the duet from R&AMP;B
singers' Monifah and Chico DeBarge, ``Na Na,'' has any real steam.

<P>
   Still mining the soulfully whimsical character sketches
(``Gladys and Lucy,'' ``Grandma's Hat Pin'') and tenderly
off-kilter odes (``Little Bird'') that have been her signature
since her first album 13 years ago, singer-songwriter Victoria
Williams has rounded the corners of her eccentricities over the
years. She doesn't squeak or squawk as much, and she's tamed the
wilder edges of her oddball compositions so that her shambling
country-gospel-pop sound has steeped into something you might call
homespun jazz _ especially on the scat-heavy title track. She still
has a gift for love songs (``Joy of Love'') and a fondness for
standards (``Until the Real Thing Comes Along'') and has upped the
atmospherics this time out by re-teaming with studio whiz/master
arranger Van Dyke Parks.

<P>
   In today's bottled-water world of slick country music, Tippin is
as refreshing as the sound of someone popping open a Schlitz. His
muscle-flexing, roadhouse country is unapologetically blue-collar,
from the finger-flipping opening tune, ``Kiss This,'' to lines
about rusty pickup trucks and ``The Night Shift.'' Many of the
tunes here are built on a rock beat as subtle as a pumping oil rig,
but Tippin can also serve up a ballad so sweet (``Always Was'')
that you can almost see him showing up at the front door with
flowers. This first album on Lyric Street may be one of his best.

<P>
   Grade: A
</P>
<P>
   This rangy compilation adoringly captures the fledgling talents
of an iconic performer. Ella Fitzgerald was in her early 20s _
fronting her Famous Orchestra at venues like the Savoy and Roseland
ballrooms in New York and the Grand Terrace in Chicago _ when these
recordings were captured live in front of glass-tinkling,
smoke-exhaling, exuberantly appreciative audiences. The songs span
the gamut of the jazz singer's onstage characters: from the chirpy
ingenue (''A Tisket A Tasket,'' ``Betcha Nickel''), to the comedic
cutup (''The Yodelin' Jive,'' ``The Jumpin' Jive''), to the
temptress (''My Wubba Dolly,'' ``Well Alright ... Tonight's the
Night''). Decades before becoming the ambassador of song behind
pop-bottle glasses, the young Ella could see her way clear to the
essence of lyrical interpretation. Sixty years ago, ``In the
Groove'' proved she was a prodigious talent. Sixty years after
these recordings were minted, Fitzgerald's vocal mastery sounds
endearingly fresh.

   The former frontman of Brit rockers the Verve steps out on his
own with a surprisingly good solo debut. The symphonic grandeur of
``Brave New World'' recalls the Verve's ``Bittersweet Symphony,''
and Ashcroft knows his way around an epic ballad. The rumbling,
syncopated riff of ``New York'' threatens delicate speakers, but
the entire album is quieter and more introspective than the Verve's
rock swagger. Lyrics? Who needs lyrics. Ashcroft's won't win any
prizes, but they're good enough for rock 'n' roll. And that's what
this is. Classically British rock 'n' roll.

 &HT;    Chutney: Fancy name, simply saucy relish
 &HT;    By Betty Parham
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Last year, many food-trend watchers tapped chutney as the
accompaniment to monitor in the new millennium _ ``the next
salsa,'' many said. And sure enough, chutney has been popping up
all over the pages of slick food magazines and in the scripted
recitations of white-jacketed waiters in upscale restaurants.
Chutney this, chutney that. Chutney sounds a whole lot more
highbrow than Aunt Cora's chowchow. But the fact is, chutney is
just a fancy (read British) way of saying relish.
</P>
<P>
   Chutney came to England via India, where the word means relish.
And what does relish mean? According to Webster's: ``an appetizing
flavor ... pleasing taste ... pleasure ... enjoyment ... zest.''
</P>
<P>
   And that is what chutney and relishes are all about. In the
chemistry of a dinner plate, a little dab can be the catalyst that
puts the taste buds on high alert and becomes the counterpoint that
ignites the flavors and textures of everything else on the plate.
</P>
<P>
   Now that fresh fruits and vegetables are available year-round,
chutneys and relishes no longer have to involve complicated canning
and preserving procedures. While chutney emerges in the culinary
spotlight, chefs everywhere are experimenting with an amazing
number of creative variations that can be made fresh and stored in
the refrigerator for up to three weeks. Chutneys and relishes,
after all, are mainly chopped fruit and vegetables with vinegar and
spices added. The difference is primarily in texture.
</P>
<P>
   Along with the familiar cucumber, onion, carrots and peppers,
you will see chutneys made with bananas, tomatoes, blueberries,
strawberries, raspberries, peaches, pears, plums, apples,
cranberries, mangoes, papaya, pineapple, cherries and coconuts all
being used to accompany hot and cold meats, fish, shellfish, fowl,
eggs, cheese and vegetables.

   Spicy Tomato Chutney
</P>
<P>
   Makes about 1 1/2 cups
</P>
<P>
   Preparation time: 30-35 minutes
</P>
<P>
   Cooking time: 1 1/4 to 1 1/2 hours
</P>
<P>
   This recipe originally accompanied Roast Beef, Basil and Spicy
Tomato Chutney LaVash Sandwiches. It would also pair well with
grilled fish or chicken, or would be a nice pasta topping.
</P>
<P>
   1 pound vine-ripened tomatoes
</P>
<P>
   1 red bell pepper, stem, ribs and seeds removed
</P>
<P>
   1/2 cup red-wine vinegar
</P>
<P>
   3/4 cup cider vinegar
</P>
<P>
   3/4 cup granulated sugar
</P>
<P>
   1 teaspoon salt
</P>
<P>
   2 teaspoons mustard seeds
</P>
<P>
   1/2 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper
</P>
<P>
   1/2 teaspoon dried hot red pepper flakes
</P>
<P>
   3/4 cup chopped green onions, green parts only
</P>
<P>
   Chop tomatoes and bell pepper into medium dice. In a medium
saucepan, bring vinegars to a boil with sugar, salt, mustard seeds,
black pepper and red pepper flakes, stirring occasionally. When the
sugar and salt are dissolved, stir in the tomatoes, bell pepper and
green onion. Simmer mixture, uncovered, stirring occasionally,
about 1 1/4 hours, or until thickened and reduced to about 1 1/2
cups. Cool chutney completely. Chutney keeps, covered and chilled,
2 weeks.

<P>
   Per 1/4-cup serving: 115 calories, 1 gram protein, 1 gram fat
(percent calories from fat, 5), 29 grams carbohydrates, no
cholesterol, 402 milligrams sodium, 1 gram fiber.

<P>
   Pineapple and Mint Chutney
</P>
<P>
   Makes about 3 cups
</P>
<P>
   Preparation time: 45 minutes or less
</P>
<P>
   Standing time: 1 hour
</P>
<P>
   This is closer to relish than chutney, as it is not cooked.
Fresh-tasting, it's a real crowd-pleaser and can be served with
grilled fish or meat (pork tenderloin would be especially nice), or
as a small side offering.
</P>
<P>
   1 cup loosely packed fresh mint leaves, rinsed, spun dry and
chopped fairly fine
</P>
<P>
   1 (4 1/2-pound) pineapple, peeled, cored and cut into 1/3-inch
dice
</P>
<P>
   1/3 cup minced red onion
</P>
<P>
   1/4 cup granulated sugar, or to taste
</P>
<P>
   Pinch salt
</P>
<P>
   In a bowl, combine mint with pineapple, onion, sugar and a pinch
of salt. Stir until well-combined. Cover and let stand for 1 hour.
(The chutney may be made 1 week in advance and kept covered and
chilled; however, we found that after a few days the minty flavor
became overwhelming. We would recommend using it within a day or
two.)
</P>
<P>
   Per 1/4-cup serving: 37 calories, trace protein, no fat, 9 grams
carbohydrates, no cholesterol, 23 milligrams sodium, 1 gram fiber.

 &HT;    Cabbage soup that's worthy of restaurant
 &HT;    By Marcia Langhenry
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Marion Schnerr of Trenton, N.J., asked for cabbage soup like one
she enjoyed at a Pennsylvania restaurant. That prompted Mariettan
Aldo Fabbri to remind us of his soup recipe that was published with
a story featuring him two years ago.
</P>

   Our tester likes the soup, noting that it freezes well so you
can serve half now and half later. We hope it meets with Schnerr's
complete approval.

 &HT;    `Blood Simple' an early look at inimitable Coens
 &HT;    By Eleanor Ringel Gillespie
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   You had to be there.
</P>
<P>
   The year was 1984. The place: The New York Film Festival. It had
been the usual festival mix with the big names ranging from Sergio
Leone to Wim Wenders. The new boy in town was Jim Jarmusch,
premiering his deadpan ``Stranger Than Paradise.'' But no one was
expecting much from something called ``Blood Simple,'' a low-budget
independent first feature by a couple of nobodies named Joel and
Ethan Coen.
</P>
<P>
   The picture _ a tale of lust and murder in the prairie dust of
Nowhere, Texas _ hit the jaded, bleary-eyed press corps like a
re-discoveing, think again. The two would-be parents are played by
two barely knowns (at the time) named Holly Hunter and Nicolas
Cage.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  ``Barton Fink'' (1991): Probably my favorite of the Coen films
if only because it's so mean about intellectuals as well as
hilariously berserk and mind-teasingly perverse about writer's
block. In the early '40s, a high-minded New York playwright (John
Turturro) is lured to Hollywood to impart ``that Barton Fink
feeling'' to a Wallace Beery wrestling picture.
</P>
<P>
   In one sense, the movie is about his ``Day of the Locust''
encounters with moguls, stars and washed-up Southern novelists
who've sold out to the flicks. But there's also the eerie hotel
where Barton stays _ a place worthy of ``The Shining'' where, as
Barton slowly goes mad, his neighbor, a deceptively genial
traveling salesman (John Goodman), has his own unhinged feelings

 &HT;    Cool stuff for school
 &HT;    By Sabine Morrow
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   The carefree days of vacation are quickly giving way to the
grueling days of school. For the summer slackers around the house,
that means a rude awakening to endless stretches of math, a bit of
lit, poking around in a lab and actually working on a personal
computer rather than blasting sworn enemies into another universe.
</P>
<P>
   Bummer.
</P>
<P>
   But in the likely event your anxious offspring think the
situation is simply too grim to bear, show them these cool tools
for school. We're not talking totally boring yellow No. 2 pencils
and blue-lined notebook paper. These awesome finds are guaranteed
to brighten up the bus ride, lunch time _ and maybe even class.
</P>
<P>
   Soaps on a rope
</P>
<P>
   Feeling young and restless because of withdrawal from a summer
of watching your favorite soap operas? We think this Sony color TV
Watchman might help. This cool mini-tube-on-the-go comes with a
combination neck strap/antenna, headphone jack and a 2-inch color
screen. When it's not around your neck, it stashes neatly in your
backpack.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  At most Circuit City stores. $99.
</P>
<P>
   Time of your life
</P>
<P>
   If you're too cool for a wristwatch but still want to make it to
class on time, check out these clever timepieces. The K-9 Dog Tag
Watch by Chaos (top) hangs around your neck and gives you the time,
date and temperature in cool LCD readings. It comes in neon colors
and even glows in the dark with the press of a button.
</P>
<P>
   And from tic-tic we snagged some fun timepieces that clip to
your bookbag, lunchbox or belt loops (VW Beetle, left, and robot,
above). They come in a wide variety of shapes, ranging from cowboy
boots and handbags to sassy high-heeled pumps and even feet.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  At Rich's stores. K-9 Dog Tag, $29.99; tic-tics, $19.99 each.
</P>
<P>
   Tunes to go
</P>
<P>
   If you must have music wherever you go, consider this affordable
metallic blue personal CD player by RCA. It features a two-step
bass boost, shuffle/repeat function, 24 tracks programming and
comfortable earphones. To store those discs we found a super rugged
CD wallet by EXO that's fairly soft but with hard reinforced edges.
It holds 32 CDs and is perfect for cramming into your locker or
backpack.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  At most Best Buy stores. RCA personal CD player, $39.99. EXO
CD wallet, $14.99.
</P>
<P>
   Neon madness
</P>
<P>
   You can make school work more exciting with these neon
accessories. These jazzy IBM-formatted Neon Colors floppy disks by

 &HT;    One Atlantan gives her home the look for less
 &HT;    By Danny C. Flanders
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Jackie Cottrill knows how to cut corners _ and, more important,
when not to. After all, the Atlantan has decorated, and in some
cases designed, 18 houses for her family over the past 25 years.
</P>
<P>
   Yet she's not a professional designer or decorator; she's a
homemaker who's learned dozens of tricks of the trade by working
closely with architects, builders and other experts. She's also
stumbled onto scores of ideas by scanning magazines and by shopping
flea markets, salvage yards and closeout sales. Other ideas come to
her through trial and _ yes _ error.
</P>
<P>
   Cottrill knows not to scrimp on some things, such as installing
limestone tile or painting interior trim. At the same time, she's
figured out how to get the look of expensive custom bathroom
cabinets by attaching $1 table legs. Every top dollar she's paid on
one project can be justified with the savings on another.
</P>
<P>
   Among her best advice to those building or remodeling is to make
sure they communicate with professionals. For her latest project, a
French manor house in Buckhead, she hired architect Tim Adams of
Harrison Design Associates and builder Warren Sirzyk of Renaissance
Development.
</P>
<P>
   ``I knew what I wanted and what I didn't, so I made lists,''
Cottrill said. ``That way, we didn't end up making a lot of
changes, which run up the fees. If you're prepared, you'll save.''
</P>
<P>
   The photos of her home on these and the following pages show how
Cottrill gets great looks for less.
</P>
<P>
   K I T C H E N S A N D B A T H R O O M S
</P>
<P>
   1. STAGGERING IDEA: Give kitchen cabinets the look of custom
furniture by pulling them out slightly from the wall and covering
them with wider countertops. Don't be afraid to mix hardware
styles; in this case, wooden knobs play up more expensive nickel
drawer pulls.
</P>
<P>
   2. THE PLOT THICKENS: Create the look of thick granite
countertops by gluing a decorative beveled edge of granite to the
granite slab, saving 25 percent to 40 percent on the cost of a
solid piece, depending on the grade of stone.
</P>
<P>
   3. NOT FOR SALE? Watch for sales on floor samples. Cottrill
saved on her powder room vanity by buying this sink off the floor
and dropping it into a cabinet. The cabinet's marble top was
cracked, so she replaced it with a slab of limestone left over from
her bar.
</P>
<P>
   4. DETAILS, DETAILS: High-end custom cabinets like hers can be
emulated by adding details such as balusters to the ends of
islands.
</P>
<P>
   5. A LEG UP: Bathroom cabinetry takes on a custom look when
anchored to the wall and dressed up with inexpensive furniture legs
glued to the bottom. Cottrill buys the legs for 50 cents to $2 each
at Scott Antique Market.
</P>
<P>
   F L O O R S
</P>
<P>
   6. ROAD NARROWS: Reserve wide-plank flooring for heavy-traffic
areas and install less expensive, narrower boards in less visiible
areas. Cottrill used 5-inch oak in hallways and 3-inch oak in
bedrooms, abutting above, for savings of about $1.50 to $2 per
square foot.
</P>
<P>
   7. RISING HIGH: Oak treads and runners are appealing, but for
about one-third the cost consider pine treads covered in carpet.
While you're at it, you can mimic this stairwell's paneling by
getting creative with moldings.
</P>
<P>
   L I G H T I N G
</P>
<P>
   8. SHADY BUSINESS: Spiff up a chandelier by adding lampshades.
Cottrill's favorite sources are Finders Keepers Home Accents
(404-355-2600) and Outrageous Bargains (770-497-9577).
</P>
<P>
   9. BRIGHT IDEAS: Chandeliers can be a big-ticket item,
especially when you have large spaces to light. Cottrill saved by
buying an inexpensive outdoor fixture for her rear stairwell,
allowing her to invest more in lighting for more visible rooms.
</P>
<P>
   C E I L I N G S
</P>
<P>
   10. GRIDLOCK OPTION: Coffered ceilings like this one can be
expensive. One alternative is to use decorative moldings to create
a grid on a plain ceiling. It may not be as three-dimensional, but
the effect is similar and about half to one-third the cost.
</P>
<P>
   11. BEAM ME UP, JACKIE: Exposed beams made of oak or cedar are
popular ceiling details. A less expensive alternative are boxed
beams, a hollow but decorative touch.
</P>
<P>
   12. BOARDS OR PANELS? Who doesn't like the homey feel of a
tongue-and-groove ceiling? To save money, consider paneling with
that look, available at hardware chains.
</P>
<P>
   Savings hints
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Buy a piece of furniture, accessory or object you love, if you
can afford it; you'll make it work somewhere at some point in your
house.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Never scrimp on tile installation. If need be, choose a less
expensive tile and pay more to have it properly installed.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Invest in intricate moldings for a few special rooms if you
can't afford molding for the entire house. Shop salvage yards for
interesting pieces.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Create the look of wide moldings by leaving several inches of
wall between a standard crown molding and a thin strip, then paint
the space in between white.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Invest in good-quality paint, mechanical systems and windows
and doors.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Rewire old chandeliers to save the cost of new ones. Scout
garage sales and antique markets for deals.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Use expensive items and materials sparingly for biggest
impact.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Be practical about color schemes. By using only three colors
in her house _ beige, black and white _ Cottrill is able to move
furnishings and accessories from room to room.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Pre-wire for sound and theater systems when you build, even if
you don't plan to add those amenities until years later. It's more
expensive to retrofit a house.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Save about 40 percent on the cost of kitchen granite by
installing granite slab on islands and other work areas and less
expensive tile on countertops.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Save 25 percent to 50 percent of the cost of limestone on
fireplaces by using similar-looking cast stone instead.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Install commercial grades of carpet in heavily traveled areas
for withstanding wear and tear.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Dress up bathroom wall and floor tiles with inexpensive
insets. For about $30, you can buy a sheet of mosaiclike tiles that
can be cut into 2-inch-square decorative pieces. But hire a
professional to install them.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Choose inexpensive door hardware for less visible rooms and
hallways; use the savings to upgrade your choices for more visible
areas.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Buy inexpensive wooden rods for window treatments (unless
drapery weight is an issue) and make a statement with finials and
other accents.
</P>
<P>
   Jackie's bargain spots
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Garage and yard sales for unusual items.

table bases, which can be combined with other materials to create
interesting pieces.

 &HT;    An on-again, off-again love affair with orchids
 &HT;    By Lee May
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Orchids really have a hold on me. It's been a while since I've
been in an orchid period, about five or six years. Way back in the
1990s, I bought several, and together we had a roaring failure. I'd
pick out stunningly beautiful plants, with blooms and buds that
looked like lovely winged creatures. Like many orchid dabblers, I'd
enjoy the blooms for months _ that's always been one of the appeals
_ and then I'd watch the plants just sit there for the next year or
so. I'd inspect my orchids, looking for the next crop of wings.
Nothing.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, my only success at getting one to bloom again (aside
from the jewel orchid, one that grows in dirt and is quite
different from those that have provided so many prom corsages) came
a few years ago when I stashed a worn-out plant in the back garden
and forgot about it. After several months of benign neglect, I
happened to look it up in its home, hidden near a rhododendron. The
poor plant not only had survived without me, but it had bloomed,
too. Alas, no more; that single burst of beauty was the orchid's
last gasp.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, a fading orchid entrusted to me by a friend met a
similar fate when I was unable to keep it going, no matter how much
I ignored it.
</P>
<P>
   Now I have returned to orchids with zeal, if not skill. So go
the rhythms of gardening. You embrace a plant, then you let it go,
returure, then out, and in again. Sometimes, of course, love burns
hot and bright, only to burn out, never to be rekindled. It's not
necessarily so that the end of such a love negates its existence.
</P>
<P>
   In her poem ``Passer Mortuus Est,'' Edna St. Vincent Millay
wasn't talking about orchids, but she could have been: ``After all,
my erstwhile dear, / My no longer cherished, / Need we say it was
not love, / Just because it perished?''
</P>
<P>
   My love for orchids perished, only to flourish again. It rose to
new heights about a month ago, when I could no longer garden
without these flowers growing, gracing, sometimes perfuming my
indoors, adding exotic color and style to any space they visited
outdoors.
</P>
<P>
   What's not to love? Orchids always have seduced and inspired
photographers and painters who can't resist the sprays of sexy
flowers that hang like butterflies on long stems. Television
producers, too, find them irresistible when they need a touch of
elegance on a simple set occupied by a talking face: A blooming
orchid in a simple container that does not compete with the flower
makes just the right visual statement.
</P>
<P>
   How delightful it is to be in love again. To be, again, under
the spell of phalaenopsis, dendrobium, cattleya, held tighter.
Tighter. This time around, I am determined that orchids and I will
make a go of it. I even put several in those special pots with the
holes around the bottom. What fun it'll be to see roots sprouting
through.
</P>
<P>
   And I feel so horticultural, now that I have them planted in
either fir bark or a special orchid mix containing everything from
coconut husk to lava rock. I'll study knowledgeable opinions on
care and feeding, use rain or distilled water.
</P>
<P>
   All the expert advice in the world won't guarantee new blooms
after these lovely ones have gone, of course. But I do take comfort
from a friend who explains why her orchids have done so well over
the years: ``I put them where they like to be, feed and water them
once in a while _ when I think about it. Otherwise, I just leave
them alone.''
</P>
<P>
   I can do that. A man in love can do anything.

 &HT;    Shopping destination: Hartwell, Ga.
 &HT;    By Marylin Johnson
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   HARTWELL, Ga. _ When past and present meet in this former mill
town in northeast Georgia, the result is a comfortable pace and
sense of place.
</P>
<P>
   A Georgia Main Street City for three years, the 144-year-old
town of Hartwell boasts a charming 12-block area of buildings
constructed during the boom period, 1879 to 1925. These brick
structures range from warehouses and theaters to a livery stable
and have been turned by local entrepreneurs into trendy art
galleries, gift shops and restaurants.
</P>
<P>
   For example, the Hartwell Company Wearhouse, which sells
sportswear, is in a cotton warehouse on Depot Street. The Corner
gift shop, at Jackson and Depot streets, is housed in a former
gristmill, while the owners of the Wooden Shoe on North Forest
Avenue rehabbed a former five-and-dime for their home
accessories/lodge-style furnishings store.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the shops are within easy walking distance, whether you
are looking for an antique washboard, a planter-shaped boot for
your garden or a one-of-a-kind Brighton handbag.
</P>
<P>
   On a recent Friday, we caught up with Lilburn resident Carol
Mamay, who was shopping at the home decor store Your Hart's Desire.
``If I could move tomorrow, I would,'' she said. ``I'm decorating a
new lake house, and Hartwell has a lot to offer, in terms of
furnishings. And the people are so friendly.''
</P>
<P>
   Another home furnishings shop/art gallery that's causing a stir
is the year-old Artworks of Hartwell. Owner Robyn Trimm and husband
Gary were weekenders for 18 years when Gary suggested his artist
wife open a gallery. ``I call Artworks `an eclectic gallery
influenced by styles of Buckhead (upscale Atlanta district) and
Savannah,''' said Robyn. She currently sells lots of art by artists
Mayte and Martha Rogers as well as painted country furniture and
decorative wrought-iron ``Savannah garden'' pieces.
</P>
<P>
   Because of its enviable location _ at the base of the Blue Ridge
Mountains on Lake Hartwell _ the historic town of 5,000 attracts
tourists as well as residents and lake home owners. Hartwell is the
county seat of Hart County, named after the Revolutionary War
heroine Nancy Morgan Hart. It's the only county in the state named
for a woman.
</P>
<P>
   ``We want to promote Hartwell as a place to visit _ and live _
every day of the week, not just on weekends,'' said Pat Fritz,
promotions chairman of the Main Street program, which encourages
economic improvement and renovation of the downtown commercial
district. ``We already advertise in north Atlanta. And next year we
plan to put in new sidewalks, relocate the utilities underground
and add benches and landscaping to further restore downtown.
</P>
<P>
   ``Also, the historic district will soon have its first loft
apartments, in an 1890s building that housed a livery stable, then
a Coca-Cola bottling plant and a Western Auto dealership.''
</P>
<P>
   Championing the economic boom in Hartwell, which started more
than 20 years ago, is longtime Mayor Joan Saliba, who is in her
early 70s. ``We don't realize what we have in Hartwell,'' said
Saliba, who has been in office 21 years. ``The size of the
buildings (for rehab) is great, and the prices are reasonable. In
the early '80s, I renovated one of the buildings on Depot Street,
then someone else did another and it became contagious. Soon
everyone started sprucing up their property.''
</P>
<P>
   In addition to shopping, Hartwell boasts a thriving
entertainment district on Depot Street. The old cotton warehouse
that Mayor Sabila owns was turned into the Bluegrass Express and
hosts bands and bluegrass fans from around the country every
Saturday night. The Hart County Community Theater, which regularly
sells out its performances, is located in a former grain warehouse.
The new Arts Center, which opened June 30 on Howell Street, hosts a
variety of events, including a quilt show that runs through
Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   It's this sense of community that makes Hartwell a charming
place to shop in, or to live in.
</P>
<P>
   If you go
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Getting there: Hartwell is about 110 miles from Atlanta. Take
I-85 north to exit 177, which is Ga. 77. Follow the signs. It's

   Q: I have tried without success to locate Calm-X, a motion
sickness medication. Two pills taken on a plane would make me
drowsy enough so that I could fall into a light sleep to Europe and
wake up totally refreshed with zero side effects. Help!
</P>
<P>
   _ Jean Salazar, Suwanee, Ga.
</P>
<P>
   A: Calm down. We tracked down your favorite medication at
Miller's Rexall Drugs, 87 Broad St. N.W. (404-523-8481). A box of
12 dimenhydrinate tablets is $2.39. Republic Drug, which
distributes Calm-X, says the tablets are ``for the prevention and
treatment of nausea, vomiting or dizziness associated with motion
sickness.'' Hopefully, you will have smooth flying, or sailing, on
your next trip.

<P>
   Q: My husband remembers Maypo, a favorite cereal he ate as a
child in Michigan. For years, we have searched the shelves for it
and have not been able to find it. Any idea if this cereal is still
around and where we might find it?
</P>
<P>
   _ Pam Brown, Atlanta
</P>
<P>
   A: Your search is over. Faye Culver, a consumer affairs
representative with International Home Foods, says Maypo is not as
popular in the South because ``it's a cooked cereal.'' However, you
can order Maypo from Hometown Favorites, a Florida mail-order
business that specializes in hard-to-find candies, cereals,
condiments and everyday food items. Order at
www.hometownfavorites.com. Enter the ``store,'' click on cereal,
then scroll down to Maypo. A 14-ounce box of Maypo Instant Maple
Oatmeal Cereal is $2.85; a 19-ounce box of Maypo Vermont Style
Maple Cereal, which you cook, is $3. Or call 1-888-694-2656. And
the benefits of a bowl of Maypo? It's low in sodium and fat and
cholesterol-free.

   Q: I am looking for a hot sauce that I had in Tennessee called
Red Rooster. I've looked for the product everywhere but, you
guessed it, I can't locate it. Can you offer any assistance?
</P>
<P>
   _ Britt Tucker, Atlanta
</P>
<P>
   A: Made in the heart of Cajun country, Red Rooster Louisiana Hot
Sauce is available at Market Grocery, 16 Forest Parkway, State
Farmers Market, Building K, Forest Park (404-361-8620). A case, 24
3-ounce bottles, is $7.60. Or order it through the company at
1-800-299-9082. The heat level of Red Rooster is ``medium,'' says a
company spokesman for Bruce Foods, of New Iberia, La., which has
been turning out the red sauce since 1928.

<P>
   Q: I am trying to find The Cheapskate Monthly newsletter by Mary
Hunt.
</P>
<P>
   _ Sandra Orndorff, Jonesboro, Ga.
</P>
<P>
   A: For penny pinchers, this monthly is well worth the $18 yearly
subscription fee. Send your payment to The Cheapskate Monthly, P.O.
Box 2135, Paramount, CA 90723. Or order by calling 1-800-550-3502

   Q: Where can I find Baron men's cologne? It comes in a silver
barrel-type bottle with a round top. Help!
</P>
<P>
   _ Celina Branton, Calhoun, Ga.
</P>
<P>
   And another Baron plea: My wife bought The Baron for me when we
were dating. Since our anniversary is coming up, I thought it would
be fun to buy a bottle, but I can't find it anywhere.
</P>
<P>
   _ Chris Green, Lilburn, Ga.
</P>
<P>
   Yet another Baron inquiry: I've had no success locating The
Baron, a men's cologne that was popular within the last 10 years.
It was in a silver can with a red label.
</P>
<P>
   _ Randolph Kinder, Fitzgerald, Ga.
</P>
<P>
   A: This men's fragrance will bring back happy memories for many
men _ and their companions or wives. We found The Baron cologne,
created by LTL Fragrances in 1964, at Perfumania in Northlake Mall
(770-723-1404). A 4.5-ounce bottle is $49.99. Or order online at
www.perfumania.com. Described as ``boldly masculine,'' the scent
sparkles with top notes of bergamot, lemon and coriander. Then it
yields to vetiver, citrus and basil. The base of the fragrance is
sandalwood and cedar. We love the advertising note for The Baron:
``It is clearly the mark of a man who appreciates the finest things
that life has to offer.''

   CIR-ONLINE-SELLERS (Undated) _ Online sellers using auction
sites like eBay are even more vulnerable to fraud than online
buyers, experts say. Those who buy faulty or fake goods through
online auctions or Web shops have some recourse; insurance programs
and credit-card companies will often come to their rescue and
credit their accounts, at least up to a certain amount. But
individuals who are selling goods in online auctions have little
protection. Stolen credit cards, fake money orders and bounced
checks are risks they face. For them, the adage is turned on its
head: Seller beware. By Lisa Guernsey.

   CIR-VOICE-PORTALS (Undated) _ As manufacturers of wireless
phones, handheld computers and other Internet gadgets scramble to
make Web information accessible without the need to boot up a
computer, some companies have a different plan. They are adapting
the Web to the one device that virtually everyone has: the
telephone. And they don't mean one of those Web phones that connect
you to e-mail and stock quotes after you set up a special
wireless-service account and scroll through a series of menus and
buttons. All you need is a telephone, even an old-fashioned rotary
dial phone. These voice portals _ like Tellme, BeVocal and
Quack.com _ let you pick up a phone and let your voice do the
surfing. By Catherine Greenman.

   CIR-COMPUTER-COLUMN (Undated) _ The column: It's never easy
living as a Mac user in a Windows world, but it is a lot easier
than it used to be. Microsoft, maker of Windows, was once thought
to be Apple's greatest enemy. But then things got better. Instead
of trying to squash the Mac, Microsoft has actually spun off a unit
to create Mac software from the ground up, instead of merely
recycling old Windows code into Mac versions of its programs. A

They criticized the horizontal scrolling, the small type and the
headlines that no longer linked directly to articles. Within days,
Salon's editor, David Talbot, posted a note to readers saying,
``You win!'' and the site reverted to some of its old design. The
Salon revolt speaks volumes about the growing impatience that Web

 &HT;    RUSSIAN WEEKEND GETAWAYS HIGHLIGHT DISTURBING GAP BETWEEN RICH,
POOR
 &HT;    With Photos.

   TROITSA, Russia _ So much for a quiet weekend in the country.
</P>
<P>
   Radio reports starting at noon on Friday catalog miles-long
traffic backups on every thoroughfare leaving Moscow. Boxy, rusting
Soviet-era Lada cars filled with stressed-out families vie on the
roads with air-conditioned sport utility vehicles driven by
cellphone-wielding stockbrokers and their girlfriends. They're all
trying, if only for two days, to get away from it all.
</P>
<P>
   For millions of Russians that getaway is their dacha, a country
house that until recently, has been synonymous with time-honored
traditions of honest work on the land, work that in Soviet times
was not only idealized, but that equalized all.
</P>
<P>
   However, in today's raucously capitalistic Russia, this
tradition has changed, and weekend pursuits at the dacha highlight
the widening gap between rich and poor. As wealthy Russians add
wings and Jacuzzis to their country homes in an orgy of
keeping-up-with-the-Ivanov acquisitiveness, the poverty-stricken
rely more and more on their homegrown food just to survive.
</P>
<P>
   The change leaves many lamenting the bygone days.
</P>
<P>
   ``My weekends are forever ruined,'' said 50-year-old Andrei
Kazakov, who has owned a dacha here in the village of Troitsa, 50
miles northwest of Moscow, for the past 10 years. ``Instead of two
days to relax, I spend hours siting in traffic and then putting up
with the noise from the neighbors' hammers as they build a new
home. People are adding this and that, trying to outdo each other.
The neighborhood has definitely changed.''
</P>
<P>
   During the 1960s, when the Soviet Union was gripped by famine,
the government relaxed land laws, allowing an individual to buy
what Russians call ``Shchest Sotki,'' or 6/100s of a hectare, a
small plot roughly equivalent to 1,200 square feet.
</P>
<P>
   Rules strictly governed what could be built on allotted land _
until 1991, for example, owners were forbidden to build a two-story
house because the Communist Party viewed it as an excessive sign of
wealth. But buying a dacha was not a bid for a genteel weekend
home; they wanted a plot of land to grow vegetables and a
less-polluted spot to take their kids in the summer.
</P>
<P>
   Those Soviet rules seem quaint now, as it's de rigueur to flaunt
one's wealth _ if you have it.
</P>
<P>
   In the countryside, tumbledown wooden huts now lie in the
shadows of massive brick and cement mansions ns, the country's
newly rich businessmen. On the income scale, the top 10 percent of
Russians own 35 percent of the country's wealth, while the lowest
10 percent control only 2 percent, according to government
statistics released last week.
</P>
<P>
   For Gocha Alibayev, who owns his own interior design company in
Moscow, these wealthy few, who are disparaged by most of society as
cruel and gaudy, are a godsend.
</P>
<P>
   ``For them, its nothing to order $15,000 worth of work, and when
it's done decide they've changed their mind and tell us they'll
give another $10,000 to start again,'' Alibayev said. ``I wouldn't
be in business without them.''
</P>
<P>
   In an otherwise lackluster economy, the New Russians' dacha
excesses have fueled their own spurt of consumerism, from Home
Depot-style warehouse stores, where one can buy plastic lawn chairs
for $100 a piece and weed-whackers to a host of Russian-language
magazines about gardening.
</P>
<P>
   In Pokolnoyoe Gora, Moscow's most elite dacha community wles to
store through the winter. On weekends, though, even she takes a
break to visit with the dwindling number of old timers in the
village, friends they've known their whole lives.
</P>
<P>
   ``The world might change around us, and new folks may move next
door, but we always have our memories,'' Kabanov said.

&HT;     LAZIO STEERS CLEAR OF GOP CONVENTION TO KEEP GORE VOTERS 
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 &HT;     By LARA JAKES

<P>
   PHILADELPHIA _ Rick Lazio, the Republican candidate facing
Democratic First Lady Hillary Rodham Clinton in the nation's
highest-profile U.S. Senate race, spent only one day at the
Republican National Convention, forfeiting a lucrative chance to
rally the troops from coast to coast behind him in spirit and with
donations.
</P>
<P>
   Lazio, who whipped through the convention hall on Tuesday for a
series of media interviews before heading home, has stayed away
from Philadelphia most of the week to attend private campaign
events _ mostly fund-raisers _ in New York.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am not running for national office here,'' he said. ``I'm
running to be the senator from New York. And it is important for me
to be able to communicate with the people and answer their
questions and to be back in New York where I belong.''
</P>
<P>
   But in a news conference outside the convention hall, the
self-described moderate called the party platform archaic,
signaling one more reason why he would miss most of the partisan
celebration.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think the platform, frankly, has been largely obsolete,''
Lazio told reporters, adding that he wants to appeal to New Yorkers
with a ``mainstream sense.''
</P>
<P>
   While in some ways more inclusive than in the past, the 2000
Republican platform still takes a hard-line conservative stand
against abortion and key gay rights. Embracing such planks could
hurt Lazio's hopes to woo moderate Democrats and independent
voters, who might split their tickets to support Vice President Al
Gore but oppose Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   Other moderate state Republicans _ most notably Lazio booster
Gov. George Pataki _ support GOP presumptive presidential nominee
George W. Bush's platform, if not every detail. But Lazio, running
even or just slightly ahead of Clinton in statewide polls, cannot
risk alienating any voters.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a simple matter of mathematics,'' said Lee Miringoff,
director of the independent Marist Institute for Public Opinion.
``He's already got the Bush supporters wrapped up. Where else are
they going to go? He needs a lot of Al Gore people to win.''
</P>
<P>
   Assuming that Gore carries New York by a 10-point margin in
November, ``Bush plus 10 percent equals Senate,'' Miringoff
declared. ``And you don't get Gore people voting for you if you've
taken a high-profile role in Philadelphia. They don't want to be
associated with a platform that is not salable to voters in New
York.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, in a week where anti-Hillary T-shirts and bumper stickers
are being snapped up from vendors, and similar campaign buttons are
proudly worn on the convention floor by other states' delegates,
Lazio's absence from most of the convention is all too evident.
Especially among New York delegates, some of whom have quietly
wondered if Lazio was purposely kept out of the loop.
</P>
<P>
   Convention officials indicated they were loath to risk marring
their purposely upbeat display of playing nice by giving prime time
to a candidate engaged in a negative campaign. ``There has been a
real ... effort not to take swings at the record of the last eight
years,'' said Republican strategist Jim Lake, a top convention
coordinator. ``We're going to talk about what we're going to do,
not resort to angry, bitter attacks.''
</P>
<P>
   Coordinators had offered the lectern to Lazio during the Monday
morning session, at a time when few delegates were on the floor and
none of the network television cameras were turned on. He had
turned it down.
</P>
<P>
   And though he insisted he would not get down in the ``mud'' over
the next three months, Lazio nonetheless went on the offensive in
Philadelphia, asking New York delegates at a brunch if they ``want
to be lectured for the next six years by Hillary Rodham Clinton.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Do we believe in character? Do we believe in honesty? Do we
believe in integrity?'' Lazio asked the state delegates in a speech
that inevitably drew comparisons between his candidacy and
Clinton's. ``I believe the answer is yes.''
</P>
<P>
   State Democrats, led by party chairwoman Judith Hope, wasted no
time in hitting back. Hope jumped on a train Tuesday morning to
hold a news conference outside the hotel in Philadelphia where the
New York delegation is staying to blast Lazio for failing to make
his income tax returns public.
</P>
<P>
   ``He doesn't seem to think this is a subject worth serious
discussion,'' Hope said. ``So we just decided to follow him here to
Philadelphia ... and once again, on his own turf, tell him we're
not going away. We really think he should do the right thing.''
</P>
<P>
   She later added: ``It is not my intention to be negative.''
</P>
<P>
   On the tax returns, Lazio promised to make the documents public,
standard procedure for statewide candidates, ``by the summer.''
Reminded that summertime is already halfway over, Lazio responded:
``Listen, I don't have all the information in front of me ... We're
going to release them.''

 &HT;    Fireplace might not be ready for use after insert is removed
 &HT;    By James Cummings
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   DAYTON, Ohio - Fireplace inserts and wood stoves seemed to be
everywhere during the 1970s and 1980s. More recently, high-tech gas
fireplaces seem to be dominant.
</P>
<P>
   This week we answer a question from a family that has gotten rid
of its old fireplace insert.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  C.T. and S.T. used a Craft Stove wood-burning fireplace insert
made of heavy cast-iron in their home for about 20 years before
removing it this year. The inside of the fireplace where the stove
was placed was covered with a black residue. They believe the
residue is creosote from the fires and want to know how to return
the fireplace to its original look.
</P>
<P>
   Suggestion: Several sources gave several pieces of advice _ some
of it conflicting _ about cleaning the inside of the fireplace.
Also, they offered some advice on re-using the fireplace as an open
burning unit. For starters, the residue inside the fireplace is
most likely made up of creosote and soot, natural byproducts of
burning wood. Rick Schneider, customer service manager for National
Steelcrafters, a company that made the insert, said that when an
insert is installed with a direct vent these days, there are pipes
included to send the smoke up the chimney. But they often weren't
installed that way 20 years ago. Then the installers sealed around
the face of the stove so the smoke could swirl around the outside
of the firebox before going up the chimney. The black residue is
the result of that swirling smoke. Schneider suggests a light
scrubbing with a wire brush to get rid of most of the crud. Then
wash the surface with vinegar to remove the burnt smell.
</P>
<P>
   Christi Lux, owner of Centerville Chimney Works, and Caryl
Hoelscher, owner of Abbey Road Chimney Sweeps Inc., suggested using
products specifically designed for hearth cleanup. They said a
product called Speedy White does a very good job of cleaning
fireplace glass and might also clean your brick. Stores that sell
fireplace equipment should carry Speedy White or something similar.
</P>
<P>
   If all else fails, Schneider said a coat or two of latex paint
will make the brick look clean and new. He said paint also seals in
and eliminates any old smells from burning residue that has
permeated the porous brick of the hearth.
</P>
<P>
   Now that the fireplace insert has been removed, the fireplace is
not ready for burning wood in an open fire again. Most people with
fireplace inserts used them as supplemental heat sources, so they
were used fairly often. C.T. and S.T. said they had their fireplace
serviced regularly, but many people with inserts did not have
chimney sweeps in for regular cleaning and maintenance. Inserts
typically produce lots of creosote, so the walls inside the chimney
where an insert has been used can be heavily coated. If creosote is
allowed to build up until it hardens, that's called glazing, and it
must be removed before the fireplace can be safely used. Creosote
is flammable, and a fire inside a chimney is frightening and can do
expensive damage to the chimney lining.
</P>
<P>
   When the fireplace damper has been removed to install a
fireplace insert, the damper must be replaced. Typically, the
original damper has been discarded, so a chimney-repair specialist
will have to install a new one. The most popular kind being used
today sits on top of the chimney and is controlled by a chain that
hangs down in the fireplace.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  R.J. said many of the brick, ranch-style houses in his
neighborhood were built with wood siding at the ends of the houses,
where the roof comes to a peak. Over the years, white, streaky
stains have developed on the bricks below the gable areas on many
of the houses. R.J. covered his gables with vinyl siding and hasn't
gotten any new stains, but he wanted to know what caused the stains
and how to remove them.
</P>
<P>
   Suggestions: The stains on the brick apparently come from
pigments that have washed down the wall as the paint has
deteriorated, a couple of experts said. Mark Mangan, sales manager
for Coronado Paint Co. of Edgewater, Fla., said some inexpensive
latex paints readily break down from exposure to rain and sun, and
the pigments in the paint become dissolved in rainwater and flow
down the wall. He also said self-cleaning paints marketed in the
1960s and 1970s were designed to allow surface layers of the paint
to rinse away to keep the paint looking fresh. Either situation is
a problem when the pigments run into an area of a different color.
Bob Bonadies, do-it-yourself product coordinator for Benjamin Moore
Paints, said R.J.'s installation of vinyl siding will keep the
problem from getting worse because the siding keeps rainwater from
reaching the paint. But he and Mangan said others in the
neighborhood can achieve the same result by repainting the area
with quality latex paint and painting again at the first signs of
deterioration, perhaps as often as every five years. Repaint when a
finger run across the surface picks up paint.
</P>
<P>
   Cleaning paint pigment from brick can be tricky, they said.
Bricks come in many different varieties, and what would work on one
type of brick might be too harsh for another type. Some bricks are
baked very hard and may have a surface glaze that keeps liquids
from penetrating. Other bricks are relatively soft and porous, and
liquid-borne stains sink in deeply. Mangan and Bonadies suggested
experimenting with various cleaning methods, starting with the
least aggressive and progressing to the harshest options only if
nothing milder works. Test the methods in an inconspicuous spot
before attacking large, prominent areas.
</P>
<P>
   First try a mild detergent and a scrub brush and rinse with a
garden hose. Trisodium phosphate, also known as TSP, is a good
choice to try. You'll find it where paints are sold. If that
doesn't work, try a power washer. Start with a wide spray on
moderate pressure and increase the pressure and narrow the focus of
the spray until you get results. If power washing doesn't work,
consult with a company that does sand blasting. Sand blasting is
expensive, can damage brick and might not get rid of all the
stains. After cleaning the brick, Mangan suggests using a masonry
sealer that protects the brick from water without blocking the
natural movement of air through the brick.
</P>
<P>
   Another option is painting or staining the brick to a uniform
color. Remember, though, that painted brick must be repainted
periodically, just like any other painted surface.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  S.L. of Kettering has a 40-year-old houseg, and some years ago
the family had central air conditioning added. The ductwork to
bring cool air to the house originates in the attic, and S.L. said
several of the ducts have developed cracks.
</P>
<P>
   Suggestion: Walt Hibner, manager of Dayton Power and Light Co.'s
Energy Resource Center, says an air-conditioning system with leaky
ducts is a major energy waster. The system uses considerable
electricity to remove heat from the air, and the cooled air
traveling through the ducts is a resource for which you have paid
dearly. You might be able to make effective temporary repairs by
covering the leaks with aluminum-insulated duct tape. But if the
leaks are numerous or large, you'll need to call in a
heating-and-ventilating professional to make repairs. Is the system
new enough to be under warranty? Contact the original installers to
see what they're willing to do to make the system right.
</P>
<P>
   Which brings up an important point: Always hold on to
documentation for any appliance you buy or any work you have done.
Even if you do no more than toss your purchase receipts into a
drawer, you'll at least be able to prove where you bought a
product. If you're going with the junk drawer method, also toss in
your owner's manuals, assembly instructions and labels from empty
paint cans and other products you've used so that, if a problem
develops, you'll know where to go for information.

<P>
   TROITSA, Russia _ So much for a quiet weekend in the country.
</P>
<P>
   Radio reports starting at noon on Friday catalog miles-long
traffic backups on every thoroughfare leaving Moscow. Boxy, rusting
Soviet-era Lada cars filled with stressed-out families vie on the
roads with air-conditioned sport utility vehicles driven by
cellphone-wielding stockbrokers and their girlfriends. They're all
trying, if only for two days, to get away from it all.
</P>
<P>
   For millions of Russians that getaway is their dacha, a country
house that until recently, has been synonymous with time-honored
traditions of honest work on the land, work that in Soviet times
was not only idealized, but that equalized all.
</P>
<P>
   However, in today's raucously capitalistic Russia, this
tradition has changed, and weekend pursuits at the dacha highlight
the widening gap between rich and poor. As wealthy Russians add
wings and Jacuzzis to their country homes in an orgy of
keeping-up-with-the-Ivanov acquisitiveness, the poverty-stricken
rely more and more on their homegrown food just to survive.
</P>
<P>
   The change leaves many lamenting the bygone days.
</P>
<P>
   ``My weekends are forever ruined,'' said 50-year-old Andrei
Kazakov, who has owned a dacha here in the village of Troitsa, 50
miles northwest of Moscow, for the past 10 years. ``Instead of two
days to relax, I spend hours siting in traffic and then putting up
with the noise from the neighbors' hammers as they build a new
home. People are adding this and that, trying to outdo each other.
The neighborhood has definitely changed.''
</P>
<P>
   During the 1960s, when the Soviet Union was gripped by famine,
the government relaxed land laws, allowing an individual to buy
what Russians call ``Shchest Sotki,'' or 6/100s of a hectare, a
small plot roughly equivalent to 1,200 square feet.
</P>
<P>
   Rules strictly governed what could be built on allotted land _
until 1991, for example, owners were forbidden to build a two-story
house because the Communist Party viewed it as an excessive sign of
wealth. But buying a dacha was not a bid for a genteel weekend
home; they wanted a plot of land to grow vegetables and a
less-polluted spot to take their kids in the summer.
</P>
<P>
   Those Soviet rules seem quaint now, as it's de rigueur to flaunt
one's wealth _ if you have it.
</P>
<P>
   In the countryside, tumbledown wooden huts now lie in the
shadows of massive brick and cement mansions built by New Russians,
the country's newly rich businessmen. On the income scale, the top
10 percent of Russians own 35 percent of the country's wealth,
while the lowest 10 percent control only 2 percent, according to
government statistics released last week.
</P>
<P>
   For Gocha Alibayev, who owns his own interior design company in
Moscow, these wealthy few, who are disparaged by most of society as
cruel and gaudy, are a godsend.
</P>
<P>
   ``For them, its nothing to order $15,000 worth of work, and when
it's done decide they've changed their mind and tell us they'll
give another $10,000 to start again,'' Alibayev said. ``I wouldn't
be in business without them.''
</P>
<P>
   In an otherwise lackluster economy, the New Russians' dacha
excesses have fueled their own spurt of consumerism, from Home
Depot-style warehouse stores, where one can buy plastic lawn chairs
for $100 a piece and weed-whackers to a host of Russian-language
magazines about gardening.
</P>
<P>
   In Pokolnoyoe Gora, Moscow's most elite dacha community where
politicians hobnob with movie stars, a real estate agent can help
find a five-bedroom ``cottage'' with swimming pool for only $5,000
per month, plus commission _ more than 50 times the average annual
salary in Russia.
</P>
<P>
   All this leaves Kazakov, and his long-time neighbor Igor
Kabanov, nostalgic for the Soviet days when a family without a
dacha could go to any village in the vicinity of Moscow and make a
deal with a dacha owner to pay 100 rubles (less than US$4) for a
month's rent.
</P>
<P>
   Kabanov, a 72-year-old retired navy officer and his wife Irina
spend their weekends at the dacha from the start of spring until
the first snow, usually in early October. They travel to suburbs
like Pokolnoyoe Gora and sit by the side of the highway to sell a
bushel of potatoes and flowers they've grown because Kabanov's
pension, the couple's only source of income, isn't even enough to
buy his heart medicine.
</P>
<P>
   ``We can earn about 15 percent more, because those fools have
money to throw away,'' Kabanov said of the New Russian communities.
``But anyway, our (produce) is worth it. We've been gardening all
our lives, and we know all the tricks.''
</P>
<P>
   On summer evenings, Irina will pickle and can their fruits and
vegetables to store through the winter. On weekends, though, even
she takes a break to visit with the dwindling number of old timers
in the village, friends they've known their whole lives.
</P>
<P>
   ``The world might change around us, and new folks may move next
door, but we always have our memories,'' Kabanov said.

trying, if only for two days, to get away from it all.
</P>
<P>
   For millions of Russians that getaway is their dacha, a country
house that until recently, has been synonymous with time-honored
traditions of honest work on the land, work that in Soviet times
was not only idealized, but that equalized all.
</P>
<P>
   However, in today's raucously capitalistic Russia, this
tradition has changed, and weekend pursuits at the dacha highlight
the widening gap between rich and poor. As wealthy Russians add
wings and Jacuzzis to their country homes in an orgy of
keeping-up-with-the-Ivanov acquisitiveness, the poverty-stricken
rely more and more on their homegrown food just to survive.
</P>
<P>
   The change leaves many lamenting the bygone days.
</P>
<P>
   ``My weekends are forever ruined,'' said 50-year-old Andrei
Kazakov, who has owned a dacha here in the village of Troitsa, 50
miles northwest of Moscow, for the past 10 years. ``Instead of two
days to relax, I spend hours siting in traffic and then putting up
with the noise from the neighbors' hammers as they build a new
home. People are adding this and that, trying to outdo each other.
The neighborhood has definitely changed.''
</P>
<P>
   During the 1960s, when the Soviet Union was gripped by famine,
the government relaxed land laws, allowing an individual to buy
what Russians call ``Shchest Sotki,'' or 6/100s of a hectare, a
small plot roughly equivalent to 1,200 square feet.
</P>
<P>
   Rules strictly governed what could be built on allotted land _
until 1991, for example, owners were forbidden to build a two-story
house because the Communist Party viewed it as an excessive sign of
wealth. But buying a dacha was not a bid for a genteel weekend
home; they wanted a plot of land to grow vegetables and a
less-polluted spot to take their kids in the summer.
</P>
<P>
   Those Soviet rules seem quaint now, as it's de rigueur to flaunt
one's wealth _ if you have it.
</P>
<P>
   In the countryside, tumbledown wooden huts now lie in the
shadows of massive brick and cement mansions built by New Russians,
the country's newly rich businessmen. On the income scale, the top
10 percent of Russians own 35 percent of the country's wealth,
while the lowest 10 percent control only 2 percent, according to
government statistics released last week.
</P>
<P>
   For Gocha Alibayev, who owns his own interior design company in
Moscow, these wealthy few, who are disparaged by most of society as
cruel and gaudy, are a godsend.
</P>
<P>
   ``For them, its nothing to order $15,000 worth of work, and when
it's done decide they've changed their mind and tell us they'll
give another $10,000 to start again,'' Alibayev said. ``I wouldn't
be in business without them.''
</P>
<P>
   In an otherwise lackluster economy, the New Russians' dacha
excesses have fueled their own spurt of consumerism, from Home
Depot-style warehouse stores, where one can buy plastic lawn chairs
for $100 a piece and weed-whackers to a host of Russian-language
magazines about gardening.
</P>
<P>
   In Pokolnoyoe Gora, Moscow's most elite dacha community where
politicians hobnob with movie stars, a real estate agent can help
find a five-bedroom ``cottage'' with swimming pool for only $5,000
per month, plus commission _ more than 50 times the average annual
salary in Russia.
</P>
<P>
   All this leaves Kazakov, and his long-time neighbor Igor
Kabanov, nostalgic for the Soviet days when a family without a
dacha could go to any village in the vicinity of Moscow and make a
deal with a dacha owner to pay 100 rubles (less than US$4) for a
month's rent.
</P>
<P>
   Kabanov, a 72-year-old retired navy officer and his wife Irina
spend their weekends at the dacha from the start of spring until
the first snow, usually in early October. They travel to suburbs
like Pokolnoyoe Gora and sit by the side of the highway to sell a
bushel of potatoes and flowers they've grown because Kabanov's
pension, the couple's only source of income, isn't even enough to
buy his heart medicine.
</P>
<P>
   ``We can earn about 15 percent more, because those fools have
money to throw away,'' Kabanov said of the New Russian communities.
``But anyway, our (produce) is worth it. We've been gardening all
our lives, and we know all the tricks.''
</P>
<P>
   On summer evenings, Irina will pickle and can their fruits and
vegetables to store through the winter. On weekends, though, even
she takes a break to visit with the dwindling number of old timers
in the village, friends they've known their whole lives.
</P>
<P>
   ``The world might change around us, and new folks may move next
door, but we always have our memories,'' Kabanov said.

   BEVERLY HILLS -- Michelle Pfeiffer's biggest problem making the
psychological thriller (beginitalic)What Lies Beneath
(enditalic)wasn't learning her lines or even holding her own with
co-star Harrison Ford.
</P>
<P>
   It was her buoyancy.
</P>
<P>
   ``They had to weigh me down because I kept floating up,'' says
Pfeiffer, whose character has a long, crucial scene in a bathtub.
``And my robe kept billowing, and so I had weights holding my robe
down and then I had this sandbag they would put on my stomach.''
</P>
<P>
   Eventually, a member of the crew had to climb in the water with
her.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was this big guy - they called him Moose - and he would
hold me down during the scene,'' Pfeiffer says.
</P>
<P>
   ``Moose and I became very close,'' she adds with a mischievous
grin.
</P>
<P>
   The tub sequence took two weeks to shoot, and Pfeiffer says she
was wet most of the time. But her character also played the cello,
so the actress had to find time to practice.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is how pitiful (it was),'' she says. ``I'd be in my
trailer, soaking wet with my robe on, with my wet nightgown
underneath, with my cello, with my soaked fingers, practicing my
cello like a drowned rat.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was so unglamorous.''
</P>
<P>
   The dunking aside, Pfeiffer, 43, says (beginitalic)What Lies
Beneath (enditalic)was a reach for her, especially since she had
never done a horror movie. She has always had range, playing roles
from a sultry singer in (beginitalic)The Fabulous Baker Boys
(enditalic)to a drug dealer's moll in (beginitalic)Scarface
(enditalic)to the seductive villainess Catwoman in
(beginitalic)Batman Returns(enditalic).
</P>
<P>
   Pfeiffer, who has twice been nominated for Oscars, made her film
debut in the teenage comedy (beginitalic)The Hollywood
Knights(enditalic), starred in (beginitalic)Grease 2 (enditalic)and
made a big splash in (beginitalic)Dangerous Liaisons(enditalic)
opposite John Malkovich and Glenn Close.
</P>
<P>
   Pfeiffer became interested in (beginitalic)What Lies Beneath
(enditalic)after learning that Robert Zemeckis
((beginitalic)Forrest Gump, Back to the Future(enditalic)) was
directing and that Ford had decided to star.
</P>
<P>
   ``I probably would not have done it had it not been Bob
Zemeckis,'' she says, ``because I think these movies, the reason
they don't make so many of them is that they're hard to do, which
is why they always just resort to cutting people up when they want
to scare people.''
</P>
<P>
   For his part, Zemeckis was happy to have Pfeiffer. He describes
her as a great actress with screen presence, a combination found
only in a few.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're just gifted with this thing that you can't take your
eyes off them,'' Zemeckis says. ``They have power that just comes
off that screen, plus they have all this talent.''
</P>
<P>
   About Pfeiffer, Zemeckis added, ``You can't stop watching her.''
</P>
<P>
   In the film, Pfeiffer's character, Claire, is married to Norman
Spencer (Ford), a respected researcher with a dark secret. The
truth starts to seep out as Claire begins to see the ghostly form
of a young woman and hears mysterious sounds around her house.
</P>
<P>
   Claire grows more paranoid and frightened as the supernatural
events escalate. She slowly transforms from a happy wife to a
suspicious woman to, ultimately, a frightened victim.
</P>
<P>
   Though it didn't dawn on her during filming, Pfeiffer later
realized that she was on screen in almost every scene.
</P>
<P>
   ``I suddenly started to think that it's just me walking around a
house for hours. It's going to be boring {hellip} but the other
character that is always with me is the camera,'' she says.
</P>
<P>
   In her own life, Pfeiffer says, she's never experienced a
supernatural occurrence like those in the film, but she's open to
the possibility that such things exist:
</P>
<P>
   ``I know people who have, and they're people that I really
respect {hellip} they're not crazy. So I would have to lean toward
being a believer.''

BUSH ARRIVES IN PHILADELPHIA TO CLAIM REPUBLICAN NOMINATION

<TEXT>
<P>
   PHILADELPHIA _ Gov. George W. Bush made his calibrated entry
into Philadelphia Wednesday, the day the delegates at the
Republican National Convention are to select him as their nominee
for president.
</P>
<P>
   Arriving at Philadelphia Northeast Airport Wednesday morning
amid patriotic pomp, Bush walked down a red carpet and rang a
replica of the Liberty Bell. A fife and drum corps played.
</P>
<P>
   Then it was off to a Latino music festival outside the
Philadelphia Museum of Art, where he declared, ``If all goes well,
you're looking at the next president of the United States.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush appeared with his wife, Laura, and Sen. John McCain and his
wife, Cindy. McCain addressed the convention Tuesday night, and
Bush praised the speech, calling the senator a ``living example of
duty, honor and country.''
</P>
<P>
   He added ``Senator, I can't wait to campaign with you all across
our country.''
</P>
<P>
   Children sang ``America the Beautiful'' in what an announcer
described as Spanglish. In the crowd was a large group of
college-age Republicans holding ``Viva Bush'' signs, some of whom
came from as far away as Minnesota.
</P>
<P>
   Later, Bush, former Defense Secretary Dick Cheney and their
wives appeared together before convention-goers for the first time
at a fund-raising luncheon at the Pennsylvania Convention Center in
downtown Philadelphia.
</P>
<P>
   Standing before a backdrop of a huge image of the White House,
Bush received a standing ovation and cheers.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm feeling America is ready for change,'' he said. ``They
don't want four more years of Clinton-Gore. They want someone to
appreciate our better angels, not our darker impulses.''
</P>
<P>
   Outside the convention center, a small cluster of protesters
gathered, including two representatives of People for the Ethical
Treatment of Animals wearing pink pig suits.
</P>
<P>
   Nearby, an unidentified group held a banner that proclaimed
``Republicans Plus Democrats (EQ) 1 Corporate Party.'' But except
for occasional shouts, the demonstrations were peaceful, and the
police officers far outnumbered the protesters.
</P>
<P>
   Cheney and Bush are to receive their party's official
nominations Wednesday evening at the 37th Republican National
Convention, returning to the city where Republicans held their
first convention, in 1856.
</P>
<P>
   Before Bush came to the stage at the luncheon there was a moment
of silent prayer for the health of former President Gerald R. Ford,
who was hospitalized here Wednesday after suffering two minor
strokes.
</P>
<P>
   In a departure from tradition, the vice presidential nominee
will speak on Wednesday instead of addressing the convention just
before the presidential nominee does. That schedule will focus the
spotlight solely on Bush on Thursday evening, when the candidate
delivers his address in the convention's climax.
</P>
<P>
   Republicans expect to finish their roll call of the states
Wednesday evening shortly before 10 p.m. EDT, completing the
largely ceremonial process of giving Bush the Republican
nomination. The delegates will then, on a voice vote, nominate
Cheney as the Republican vice presidential candidate.
</P>
<P>
   The 2,066 delegates started voting two days ago and are building
up to Wednesday night, when the count will surpass the required
1,034 delegate votes that Bush and Cheney need for their official
nominations.
</P>
<P>
   After accepting the nomination, Cheney will address the
convention.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   On the campaign trail, Cheney has given only relatively brief
speeches. He has appeared far more comfortable on Sunday talk shows
than on the road, where he has seemed awkward and ill at ease with
voters.
</P>
<P>
   Cheney will use his speech to reassure independent voters that
he shares their positions on many causes. Democrats have attacked
Cheney for voting against a ban on plastic guns, funding for
pre-school education programs, environmental protection measures
and sanctions against South Africa when it was under an apartheid
government.
</P>
<P>
   The Republicans have used the convention to present an image
that tries to appeal not only to the hard core members of their
party but also to independents and swing voters. Bush has worked to
soften his party's reputation by calling himself a ``compassionate
conservative'' and arguing that he represents a new kind of
Republican party.
</P>
<P>
   More than a decade ago, Democrats began a slow and divisive
transformation from a party many people linked to liberal
northeasterners like Sen. Edward M. Kennedy to a group represented
by the more moderate centrist politics of President Bill Clinton.
Bush has attempted to carry out a faster transformation of the
Republican Party over the course of an election.
</P>
<P>
   But as a result, the delegates to the convention represent a
more conservative brand of politics than the Bush-Cheney ticket
presents to the nation.
</P>
<P>
   Delegates to the convention have gone along with Bush's strategy
because they believe he will win in November and restore them to
power. But Bush's decision to make Cheney his running mate has
become something of a gesture to the rank and file of the party.
While Democratic criticism of his conservative voting record almost
appeared to catch the Bush camp off guard, it has reassured the
party faithful that despite Bush's rhetoric of inclusiveness and
reaching out to independents he is at the core as conservative as
he is compassionate.
</P>
<P>
   The Bush campaign has said Cheney will promote Bush's record of
bipartisanship in Texas, while criticizing the administration of
Clinton and Gore as divisive. The speech will also be somewhat
biographical, as Cheney describes his service under three
Republican presidents.

</P>
<P>
   ``AMERICAN RHAPSODY''
</P>
<P>
   ByJoe Eszterhas
</P>
<P>
   (Knopf, $25.95)
</P>
<P>
   We'll say right upfront that we felt as if we earned our salary
for the next five years as we struggled through this book, a
quagmire of gonzo posturing and other strange liberties to which
Eszterhas believes he's entitled. The former (beginitalic)Rolling
Stone(enditalic) writer, having made his money with screenplays to
such scintillating films as (beginitalic)Showgirls(enditalic) and
(beginitalic)Basic Instinct(enditalic)(beginitalic), (enditalic)
now shows us the real Bill Clinton or, as Eszterhas' friend, Jann
Wenner, called him, ``the first rock and roll president in American
history.'' Eszterhas was mesmerized by the Monica Lewinsky sex
scandal. He devoured the Starr report, watched it on television,
read about it in magazines. Maybe they are his sources for the
garish ``non-fiction'' sections here, but he never really makes
that clear (there are fictional parts too, including a chapter
narrated by ``Willard,'' the most famous part of Clinton's
anatomy). Read this at your own risk. And remember: No one's paying
you to do it.

<P>
   ``LOCO FOR LIZARDS''
</P>
<P>
   By Jim Cherry
</P>
<P>
   (Northland, $7.95)
</P>
<P>
   Lizards, Cherry notes, predate dinosaurs, continents, even -
gasp! - (beginitalic)S(enditalic)(beginitalic)trom
Thurmond(enditalic). If that doesn't leave you hungry for more, you
are a hard sell. This brief, well-illustrated book tells you
everything you always wanted to know about lizards and a lot you
could have done without but aren't troubled to hear, such as the
fact that a monitor lizard can run 10 mph to catch the wild pigs it
likes for supper or that its mouth is so full of bacteria that its
bite will kill its victim within a day or two even if it gets away.
Cherry also includes general information on lizards in myth, art
and advertising and in film (we were delighted to see not just
(beginitalic)Godzilla(enditalic) and (beginitalic)Journey to the
Center of the Earth(enditalic) but also (beginitalic)The
Freshman(enditalic), Andrew Bergman's comedy in which a Komodo
dragon gets loose in a shopping mall). This is a good book to hand
over to visitors from the East as they watch geckos skitter across
your block wall.
</P>
<P>
   ``POOR RICHARD'S ALMANACK''
</P>
<P>
   By Benjamin Franklin
</P>
<P>
   (Modern Library, $10.95)
</P>
<P>
   Early to bed and early to rise makes a man miss pretty much
everything good on TV. That's Ben Franklin updated by Dave Barry in
his introduction to this new edition. Barry is hilarious, in fact,
as he questions the wisdom of a few of Franklin's statements -
particularly ``if your head is wax, don't walk in the sun'' - and
heartily endorses others. ``Poor Richard advocates diligence,
self-reliance, frugality and honesty,'' writes Barry. ``He disdains
laziness, extravagance, pretense and immodesty. It goes without
saying that he hates lawyers.'' This is one of the first four books
in the Modern Library Humor and Wit series. Others are
(beginitalic)Mark Twain's Library of Humor(enditalic), with an
introduction by Roy Blount, Jr.; (beginitalic)Most of the Most of
S.J. Perelman(enditalic); and (beginitalic)Crazy Salad: Some Things
About (enditalic)(beginitalic)Women(enditalic) by Nora Ephron. The
series is edited by Steve Martin, who insists that Perelman stole
his material.
</P>
<P>
   ``BE THE ONE''
</P>
<P>
   By April Smith
</P>
<P>
   (Knopf, $24)
</P>
<P>
   Cassidy Sanderson is a formidable woman - tall, blond, athletic
and savvy enough to be a baseball scout for the Dodgers, the only
female scout in the major leagues. The competition to find new
players is stiff, and when she gets a call from an old friend in
the Dominican Republic, she quickly flies down to see the ``pure
hitter'' he has discovered. Alberto Cruz does have talent so
Cassidy signs him and brings him back to Los Angeles, but soon
Alberto begins receiving mysterious blackmail notes. Flashbacks
throughout this novel reveal that the notes are tied to a
mysterious night in the Dominican Republic when Cassidy, Alberto
and a wealthy American businessman drove drunkenly through a
hurricane just before their return to the United States. The novel
is suspenseful and well characterized although longer than it needs
to be. Smith will appear at the Poisoned Pen bookstore. See Book
Signings for details.
</P>
<P>
   ``AN INVISIBLE SIGN OF MY OWN''
</P>
<P>
   By Aimee Bender
</P>
<P>
   (Doubleday, $22.95)
</P>
<P>
   Bender's odd but very effective first novel is narrated by
20-year-old Mona Gray, a troubled young woman who struggles with
psychological scars and obsessions even as she forms attachments to
some very strange second-graders at her hometown elementary school,
where she has been hired to teach mathematics. Emotionally affected
by her father's poor health since she was 10, Mona is the ultimate
unreliable narrator, her sanity seemingly so fragile that for a
long time we don't know what to make of her. She finds comfort in
numbers - they are the constant force in her mind, her only
reliable port in life's storm. In a voice that is both witty and
spooky, Mona tells us about her students, her family and her inner
life, hinting at potential violence even as she embarks on a sweet
romance with a fellow teacher. It's a mark of Bender's subtle
virtuosity that such a surreal story is ultimately so appealing.
She's a writer to watch.
</P>
<P>
   ``THE DAY JOHN DIED''
</P>
<P>
   By Christopher Andersen
</P>
<P>
   (Morrow, $26)
</P>
<P>
   Andersen opens this book by trying to justify it, alluding to
the ``ocean of grief'' into which we all allegedly plunged upon
hearing of John F. Kennedy Jr.'s death and pointing out Kennedy's
similarities to Princess Diana (which amount to little more than
that both were ``lit from within,'' and we were obsessed with
them). You'll forgive us if we tell you that books like this make
us feel squirrelly as if we're watching a bank heist in progress
and doing nothing to stop it. But Andersen has cased this joint
before (he wrote not only (beginitalic)The Day
(enditalic)(beginitalic)John Died (enditalic)but also
(beginitalic)Jack and Jackie (enditalic)and Jackie After Jack), and
he knows where the money is. Happily, Kennedy comes off well. His
marriage was doing better; his rebellious youth was spent; and he
was, to all appearances, a good man. And we defy you to remain
unmoved at the description of the funeral service, marked by a
stunned and battered family's grief over another gone too soon.
</P>
<P>
   ``FROM OUR HOUSE: A MEMOIR''
</P>
<P>
   By Lee Martin
</P>
<P>
   (Dutton, $22.95)
</P>
<P>
   This memoir begins with a ghoulish tragedy but becomes the oddly
uplifting story of the author's determination to understand the
dynamics of his own family. In 1956, when Martin was a baby, his
father, Roy, lost both hands in an accident with a harvesting
machine on their 80-acre farm in Illinois. Roy Martin was already a
coarse, difficult man, but his misfortune instilled in him a new
level of anger. Over the years, he beat and berated his son while
Lee's mother looked on. ``I was too young to know then,'' Martin
writes, ``that she was as helpless in my father's house as I.'' But
to dismiss Roy as a villain is to deny the complexities that exist
in unhappy families. Martin explores his own responses to his
father, and so takes his story beyond self-pity and makes it an act
of salvation. His book is an unflinching look at the bonds between
a wounded man and his son and at the stoic perseverance of the
woman who loved them both.
</P>
<P>
   ``WHY WE HURT''
</P>
<P>
   By Frank T. Vertosick
</P>
<P>
   (Harcourt, $24)
</P>
<P>
   It's unsettling, reading about pain. We suspect that any amount
of discourse on specific pain would be easier to take - you have a
migraine, you have a bad back, you're looking for solutions. But
this book, subtitled (beginitalic)The Natural History of
Pain(enditalic), covers the whole gamut of discomfort, and it made
us squirm. Cancer pain, spinal pain, migraine pain, the pain of
childbirth, of carpal tunnel syndrome, of kidney stones or worse.
Vertosick, who is a neurosurgeon, eases the way with his friendly,
nonchalant tone, and he reminds us often that in the grand scheme
of things, pain has a purpose. It is, he says, ``a teacher, the
headmaster of nature's survival school.'' He discusses some of his
own patients and how he alleviated their pain and gives lots of

we're going to take some aspirin. We're not sure why.

IT'S JUST A HOP, SKIP AND SEVERAL JUMPS FROM FORT WORTH TO FAME

<P>
   You may not know her name, but you have seen Nancy Anderson over
and over again.
</P>
<P>
   She is one of the dancers on Christina Aguilera's ``What a Girl
Wants'' and ``Come on Over'' videos and has toured with Aguilera.
</P>
<P>
   She is a high school cheerleader in the scene in ``American
Beauty'' where Kevin Spacey's character lusts after another
cheerleader.
</P>
<P>
   She's dancing again on Ricky Martin's ``Livin' la Vida Loca''
video.
</P>
<P>
   That's Anderson, as Madonna's body double, walking down the
beach in the Material Girl's ``Power of Goodbye'' video.
</P>
<P>
   She's the young lady in blue in those Gillette razor
commercials.
</P>
<P>
   Still not sure you've seen her? Well, we know you've watched
those Gap ``khakis swing'' ads on TV. Anderson is one of the
dancers in those, too _ the one who is flipped upside down.
</P>
<P>
   Nancy Anderson is a 1996 Paschal High School grad who just
turned 22 and celebrated during a 27-hour bus ride on the Aguilera
tour. She may be largely unknown to the public, but she is one of
the most popular _ and sought after _ dancers in her adopted home
of Los Angeles.
</P>
<P>
   Not that any of this is going to her head. ``I still worry about
it; you never know how much work there's going to be,'' Anderson
said in a recent telephone interview. ``I feel comfortable I'll be
able to work with people I like, but there's always a feeling of,
`What's going to happen next?' They can want to hire you but need a
girl with brown hair. You can be a great dancer and never get any
work, be in the wrong place at the wrong time.''
</P>
<P>
   Less than four years after arriving in LA, Anderson is a popular
and respected member of the dance community. Her praises are sung
by well-known choreographer Travis Payne and Kitty McNamee,
artistic director of the Hysterica Dance Company.
</P>
<P>
   ``She's one of my favorite people in the city to work with,''
says Payne, who choreographed the Gap ads. ``You don't find many
people with great attitudes and (who are) always on time and never
complaining. Everybody likes her.''
</P>
<P>
   Payne worked with Anderson on the new movie ``Coyote Ugly,'' the
story of five women who run a New York bar of the same name who
become legends for their ability to dance on the bar, sometimes
while it's aflame. Anderson is a body double for Izabella Miko,
which means when you see close-ups of the fancy footwork, you'll be
seeing Anderson's legs, not Miko's.
</P>
<P>
   ``I ended up clogging!'' Anderson says, laughing because the
dance is one of those she learned in Fort Worth. ``We'd rehearse,
but they didn't want it to look like choreography _ not TOO good.
I'd run and slide on the bar, and at one point they had fire on the
bar _ we danced to Kiss and Def Leppard and Kid Rock, and we had a
blast doing it.
</P>
<P>
   ``We'd start dancing at 2 a.m. and were on a bar in 3-inch heels
and trying to clog and look cute at 4 a.m. I hurt myself _ I
sprained my ankle. It was really hard work.''
</P>
<P>
   Anderson, her sister, Audrey, and mom Sandra moved to Fort Worth
when Nancy was 4.
</P>
<P>
   ``She was a delightful little girl,'' Sandra Johnson says. ``And
she always had a passion for dance. She did what most kids do; she
took dance when she was young, and when she was 12 or 13, she
didn't want to do anything.''
</P>
<P>
   Anderson had taken ballet and tap dancing when she was ``3 or
4,'' she says, and then clogging and tumbling.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wasn't serious about it at all,'' she says. ``It was a
hobby.''
</P>
<P>
   It became her passion after a weekend in Arlington, a Fort Worth
suburb.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was 15, I hadn't had any real good training, and I went to
L.A. Underground _ it's a dance convention,'' she says. ``And I
stood in back of the room and I was so timid, and I was there all
weekend and when I walked out Sunday I realized I had forgotten
about everything else. I told my mom I wanted to be a dancer and
that (dance teacher) Dian West was really good and really strict.''
</P>
<P>
   Anderson attended West's school three blocks south of Texas
Christian University in Fort Worth _ and discovered how little
dance training she'd had.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was coming to the game late,'' she says. ``There were
11-year-olds who could do more than me _ I went home crying every
night. I lacked confidence, and it took awhile to get it. I was
timid.''
</P>
<P>
   She progressed quickly, however, and by her senior year in high
school she tried out for New York University's Tisch School of the
Arts.
</P>
<P>
   ``Every time I had been in New York, I had had so much fun,''
she says, ``and in high school, every teacher was breathing down
your neck about where you were going, so I said there. They have a
great program. They told me they were full, and I wasn't
disappointed, because we couldn't have afforded it. (But0 I always
knew I'd end up dancing _ it was just kind of core to me.''
</P>
<P>
   Adds West: ``She had so much potential. I didn't want her to get
lost in the crowd.''
</P>
<P>
   And so, also in her senior year, she auditioned for the Edge
Performing Arts Center in Los Angeles.
</P>
<P>
   ``We all knew Nancy, because she had attended events with
Dian,'' Edge director Bill Prudich says. ``She was a quiet,
unassuming young lady _ she didn't make a big noise when she
danced. Her forte at the time was her technical ability. We decided
to see what we could do with her.''
</P>
<P>
   Anderson won a one-year scholarship to Edge. She began attending
the school in September 1996 and, over the course of taking three
to five classes a day and getting a few commercials (among them
Mystic Iced Tea), she blossomed. Prudich says he really saw the
difference several months after she started.
</P>
<P>
   ``It started in the middle of the rehearsal for our showcase,''
he says. ``All of a sudden she just appeared _ who she was, who she
was trying to be. By the end of the show it was like, `Who is this
person?' And she never looked back. In the commercial world, she
has such a sellable look _ so much what little girls look like. ...
Her gifts are innate. She's not manufacturing anything.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The key was confidence,'' Anderson says. ``I stopped judging
myself. Dancing is about your love for it and what you want to
express _ once I realized that and didn't worry about it and
started having fun, people were attracted to that.''
</P>
<P>
   One of them was Kitty McNamee, founder of the Hysterica Dance
Company in Los Angeles. Anderson has been part of the troupe for
two years, when her schedule permits. ``My choreography is very
theatrical,'' McNamee says, ``and one of Nancy's strengths is,
she's very expressive and brings a lot of theatricality to her
work. She has an amazing presence and incredible intelligence _ not
only physical but also emotional. She's a huge asset to the
company.''
</P>
<P>
   But Hysterica has to share Anderson with moviemakers and touring
teen-age singers and producers of TV commercials.
</P>
<P>
   Anderson got the part for the Gap ads, for instance, by
attending an open casting call. She was picked as one of the four
principal dancers.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had about five days of rehearsal for the swing one,'' she
says. ``I'd never done swing dancing before. And we shot the whole
thing with no stops and no cuts. It took hours to shoot. We did it
in one day.''
</P>
<P>
   Payne choreographed the commercials.
</P>
<P>
   ``The khakis ads were unique in that we had choreographed camera
movement,'' he says. ``They used 360-degree camera rotations and
stop motion. The moves had to happen at exactly the same time every
time _ they had to match each take exactly. Nancy was really great,
and they loved the way she looked.''
</P>
<P>
   Anderson says she had no idea that the commercials would be so
popular; at the time, she said, she just knew they were good and
that they paid well. Seeing them on TV, she says, ``made me smile''
_ and certainly helped her career.
</P>
<P>
   Before long, she was appearing as Madonna's body double _
walking down El Matador Beach.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was all shot from the back,'' Anderson says. ``They dyed my
hair brown and put extensions in it. And I wore her clothes. All I
had to do was walk down the beach and kick off my shoes and walk
into the water. I got to go to her home and meet her daughter.
Madonna was very businesslike.''
</P>
<P>
   Did she like the video?
</P>
<P>
   ``I never even saw it!'' Anderson says. ``I don't have cable.''

&HT;     VATICAN'S ACCOUNT DOESN'T HALT FATIMA THEORIES 
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 &HT;     By JENNIFER A. DLOUHY  
 &HT;     c.2000 San Antonio Express-News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN ANTONIO _ For decades, the third secret of Fatima was
shrouded in mystery, the manuscript detailing it hidden from view
to all but a few officials at the Vatican.
</P>
<P>
   That didn't stop wild speculation in books, and later on Web
sites, about the manuscript's contents, ranging from predictions of
the Apocalypse to a devastating third world war.
</P>
<P>
   Neither has the Vatican's release of a copy of the manuscript,
handwritten years after the event by one of three shepherd children
who said the Virgin Mary appeared to them in a series of visions
that began outside Fatima, Portugal, on May 13, 1917.
</P>
<P>
   Even a statement by Cardinal Angelo Sodano at the May 13
beatification ceremony for two of the witnesses, who are now dead,
and a commentary by another top Vatican official, Cardinal Joseph
Ratzinger, haven't put the speculation to rest.
</P>
<P>
   Far from it. Conspiracy theorists and Web chatters have burned
up the Internet with accusations of a Vatican cover-up of what was
revealed to the children in the third vision.
</P>
<P>
   Early on, church leaders said the first two apparitions painted
a vision of hell, foretold the rise of communism in Russia and
predicted the end of World War I and the beginning of World War II.
</P>
<P>
   But Rome maintained its silence on the third vision for decades.
The Vatican now says the apparition predicted the 1981
assassination attempt on Pope John Paul II.
</P>
<P>
   The pope has long had a personal devotion to Our Lady of Fatima.
The attempt on his life occurred on May 13, the same date the
visions began 64 years earlier.
</P>
<P>
   But other Fatima watchers have found the Vatican's
interpretation not just anticlimactic, but a deliberate falsehood _
to them, it simply doesn't fit the evidence, especially the
manuscript the Vatican released.
</P>
<P>
   Written in 1944 by Lucia Dos Santos, the surviving witness who
is now a 93-year-old cloistered nun, it describes a vision in which
the Holy Father, bishops, priests and religious men and women climb
a steep mountain, topped by a cross.
</P>
<P>
   ``On his knees at the foot of the big cross, he was killed by a
group of soldiers who fired bullets and arrows at him,'' reads the
Vatican's English translation of the manuscript. ``In the same way
there died one after another the other bishops, priests, men and
women religious and various lay people of different ranks and
positions.''
</P>
<P>
   One of the most vocal critics of the Vatican's interpretation of
this vision, Father Paul Kramer of The Fatima Centrein Fort Erie,
Ontario, is using the fatima.org Web site to lambaste what he calls
``a Vatican whitewash.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The vision described in the text is a scene in which the pope
is shot by soldiers, and then bishops, priests and so forth are
killed in the same way, one by one, after they have all gone
through a half-ruined city,'' Kramer said in a statement posted on
the site.
</P>
<P>
   ``This clearly has nothing to do with Pope John Paul II not
being shot dead by (Mehmet) Ali Agca,'' he wrote, referring to the
Turkish gunman who wounded the pope and served a prison term for
the crime.
</P>
<P>
   Even Agca himself has gotten into the act, declaring the Vatican
``the enemy of God'' two weeks ago in a Turkish courtroom, where he
was taken after his release from an Italian prison to face
unrelated charges that predate the assassination attempt.
</P>
<P>
   In a handwritten statement, distributed outside the courtroom,
Agca praised the pope but claimed the Vatican had altered the
prophecy.
</P>
<P>
   Online, Catholics and non-Catholics alike wonder why the
disclosure came 19 years after the assassination attempt it was
said to have foretold.
</P>
<P>
   ``If it only pertains to (the) shooting of JPII, why wasn't it
released 10 years ago?'' asked one believer.
</P>
<P>
   Some critics have even called for a handwriting analysis to
compare the known writings of Dos Santos with the letter explaining
the third secret.
</P>
<P>
   Online discussions peaked just after the May 13 announcement and
seem to be tapering off. Father John Leies , chairman of the
theology department at St. Mary's University in San Antonio,
predicted the controversy would gradually die down once conspiracy
theorists heed the information provided by Vatican officials,
including the pope.
</P>
<P>
   ``Eventually,'' Leies said, ``I think reason will prevail.''

 &HT;    It's not really not enough to fry an egg, it just seems that way
 &HT;    By LAURENA MAYNE DAVIS
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   GRAND JUNCTION, Colo. - Is is hot enough to fry an egg?
</P>
<P>
   Well no it isn't. The raw egg, cracked crisply into a puddle of
canola oil on the blacktop, just kind of languished there without
frying, sizzling or even sputtering once.
</P>
<P>
   If you've been outside lately, where the temperature's been
threatening to boil up to a hundred degrees or so, you can identify
with that egg.
</P>
<P>
   Just wanting to languish. Too wiped out to even sputter.
</P>
<P>
   It's typical August, in many ways. The dog days of summer are
howling, 100 degrees is not unusual and a hammock in the shade's
looking much more inviting than a volleyball game in the sun.
</P>
<P>
   But August is starting off atypically, too, with below-normal
rainfall leading into it.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's been fairly dry,'' said David Nadler, meteorologist for
the National Weather Service in Grand Junction.
</P>
<P>
   Not that western Colorado will ever be confused with a tropical
clime.
</P>
<P>
   ``Typically in July we only see a half an inch of rain, anyway.
July is one of our driest months,'' Nadler said.
</P>
<P>
   And temperatures have been, on average, slightly hotter, and
expected to remain that way. Five degrees above normal, on average,
for the whole month of August, according to the Climate Predictions
Center.
</P>
<P>
   So while everyone else is busy moaning about the heat, we set
out to actually show just how hot it is outside _ to see if there
is any empirical truisms behind the hot weather idioms.
</P>
<P>
   Hence the egg. And a slew of other attempts to prove the
blistering power of the August sun on the Colorado Plateau.
</P>
<P>
   So we tried to make s'mores on the blacktop and a candle in the
parking lot and to affix an iron-on transfer on a T-shirt, using
only the sun.
</P>
<P>
   Then we left a Barney tape on the dash of a minivan _ with the
windows rolled up _ all day.
</P>
<P>
   (Don't feel too bad about the tape, it was a ``Barney Songs''
sing-along. Actual lyrics: ``Oh I'm brushing my teeth on the
bottom, 'cause I wouldn't wanna say that I forgot 'em!'')
</P>
<P>
   (Consider it a mercy killing.)
</P>
<P>
   Our attempts were met with mixed results, detailed here for your
reading pleasure and coming soon to a scientific journal near you.
</P>
<P>
   FIRST OF ALL THE S'MORES _ the graham cracker, marshmallow and
chocolate bar sandwich of scouting and summer camp cuisine.
</P>
<P>
   The most difficult part of this exercise was sacrificing a
perfectly good chocolate bar. But we did, and a few hours later,
the bar was oozing nicely between the crackers, though the
marshmallow puffed only slightly.
</P>
<P>
   Hypothesis: Solar heat will undramatically but effectively puff
up a marshmallow and melt a chocolate bar, remotely echoing the
blending of flavors in a campfire-roasted s'more.
</P>
<P>
   Finding: Never waste chocolate. Not even for science.
</P>
<P>
   NEXT THE CANDLE. It is widely known that it is possible to make
a variety of decorative candles at home, involving molds, wicks,
wax and third-degree burns all over your hands from the wax that is
about 400,000 degrees Fahrenheit when in liquid form.
</P>
<P>
   On the blacktop, we simply poured some Candle Magic wax crystals
into an aluminum, star-shaped mold.
</P>
<P>
   Hypothesis: Sunlight will melt the flaked wax into a solid
candle form.
</P>
<P>
   Finding: Indeed, this exercise worked beautifully, as many who
have placed candles on their window ledges at home can attest.
</P>
<P>
   THE IRON-ON TRANSFER, admittedly, was a long shot, a dark horse.
The instructions call for simply ironing on the wool/cotton
setting, no steam, letting the transfer cool, and peeling off the
paper backing.
</P>
<P>
   Hypothesis: Enough heat will be generated from the sun shining
on the blacktop that an iron-on transfer can be applied to a
T-shirt.
</P>
<P>
   Finding: You will get only a hot T-shirt, which should be
reassuring to people actually wearing T-shirts with iron-on
transfers in this weather.
</P>
<P>
   AS FOR THE BARNEY TAPE, it was unchanged, probably because it
was white (as opposed to black) and possnot the happy fate of most
videotapes, said Mary Garcia, store director for Hollywood Video.
</P>
<P>
   ``In a couple of hours it'll warp,'' Garcia said of a videotape
left in a car. ``I've actually had a rash of them the last couple
of weeks.
</P>
<P>
   ``We saw a few of them at the beginning of the summer, but this
last month has been a doozy. The moral of the story is don't leave
your dog in there, either.''
</P>
<P>
   Hypothesis: Videotapes will melt, warp and contort when left
inside your car in this heat.
</P>
<P>
   Finding: For every tape but Barney, this is true.

ANTI-CHENEY CAMPAIGN TAKES BLOW FROM POWELL
</HEADLINE>
  (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
 By BILL THOMPSON 
 c.2000 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   The frantic campaign by Democrats and their cohorts in the news
media to demonize Dick Cheney suffered a major setback Monday.
</P>
<P>
   The setback was administered by Colin Powell and came in the
form of an unequivocal, enthusiastic endorsement of the
Republicans' vice presidential nominee-to-be.
</P>
<P>
   Powell, the universally admired retired Army general who was the
first African-American to serve as chairman of the Joint Chiefs of
Staff, used the occasion of his opening-night speech at the
Republican National Convention to call Cheney ``a man I have known
and respected for many years.'' He praised the ex-secretary of
defense as ``one of the most distinguished and dedicated public
servants this nation has ever had.''
</P>
<P>
   ``He will be a superb vice president,'' Powell declared.
</P>
<P>
   Powell's tribute was no run-of-the-mill endorsement _ and not
just because the two worked together during the Persian Gulf War.
Keep in mind that Powell is America's most famous black Republican
and the Grand Old Party's most revered ``moderate.''
</P>
<P>
   Ever since GOP presidential nominee-in-waiting George W. Bush
picked Cheney as his running mate, the political attack squads have
been tying to portray the former Wyoming congressman as a
right-wing zealot whose views are at odds with the compassionate
conservatism espoused by Bush.
</P>
<P>
   But if Powell _ whose speech included a blast at Republican
resistance to affirmative action _ harbors no philosophical
objection to Cheney's candidacy, the opposition's barbs look more
and more like what they really are: partisan cheap shots.
</P>
<P>
   As for the Democrats' media cohorts, consider the following
question asked by NBC's Katie Couric in an interview with Powell on
Tuesday's ``Today'' show. I present the question just as Couric
asked it on television, with one monstrous factual error and with
no punctuation that you could notice:
</P>
<P>
   ``Let me ask you briefly if I could General Powell about your
former colleague Dick Cheney the vice presidential candidate of
course he was secretary of defense when you were chairman of the
Joint Chiefs of Staff and much has been made of his conservative
voting record I'm just curious do you have any problems with the
fact that he did vote against Head Start because you care so deeply
about education and against a resolution that would have allowed
Nelson Mandela to be released from prison?''
</P>
<P>
   Whew. Let me, let us _ let Katie and Colin, for heaven's sake _
take a breath before trekking onward.
</P>
<P>
   Whatever the context of Cheney's anti-Head Start vote _ he said
last week that he was voting for fiscal responsibility at a time of
burgeoning budget deficits _ it's ancient history and mostly
meaningless today. Bush plans to improve the Head Start program,
and Cheney supports the plan.
</P>
<P>
   A Cheney vote against Head Start a million years ago will have
no effect on the 2000 presidential election.
</P>
<P>
   Nor will Cheney's alleged vote to keep South African icon Nelson
Mandela locked up as a political prisoner way back in the 1980s. I
say ``alleged'' because Cheney never voted against any resolution
that ``would have allowed Nelson Mandela to be released from
prison,'' as Couric so erroneously stated in her question to
Powell.
</P>
<P>
   The vote at issue involved a ``sense of the House'' resolution
that urged the president of the United States to urge the South
African government to _ among other things _ let Mandela out of
jail. We're talking about a ``recommendation;'' the House of
Representatives had no authority over Mandela's imprisonment or
release.
</P>
<P>
   Cheney voted against the resolution, he said, not because he
wanted Mandela to remain in prison but because the resolution also
urged recognition of the African National Congress, which was
widely suspected of terrorist activities.
</P>
<P>
   Powell, by the way, brushed off Couric's question and insisted
that Cheney is an ``excellent choice'' for vice president.
</P>
<P>
   I'm guessing that most voters will take Powell's word for it.

   HOLOCAUST-FOOTAGE _ Film defines our public memory of the
Holocaust, and it is how most of us initially encounter its
horrors. Familiarity, perhaps, explains a commonly held belief that
the images -- historic footage and the dramatic and documentary
films that followed -- speak for themselves. But do they? The
conclusion of a panel of international scholars, simply put, is no.

 &HT;    Investors Hope the Puck Stops in Laredo 
By JOHN W. GONZALEZ 
c.2000 Houston Chronicle  &HT;     LAREDO, Texas _ Initially, some Laredo residents gave their
<TEXT>
proposal a snowball's chance, but a group of Houston businessmen is
increasingly confident it will bring professional ice hockey to
this sizzling hot border city.
<P>
   The investors, led by a former co-owner of the Houston Aeros
professional hockey team and the developer of the Aerodrome where
that team plays, first must convince voters to support a
quarter-cent sales tax increase to build a new arena. The proposed
Laredo Entertainment Center would cost $40 million.
</P>
<P>
   If residents approve the plan Aug. 12, proponents say that by
fall 2002 they could bring hockey to a city yearning for new
diversions. Officials also hope to lure concerts, wrestling,
graduations and other events to the 10,000-seat facility.
</P>
<P>
   ``We know that Laredo needs entertainment desperately,'' said
Kiki DeAyala, president of the Arena Ventures partnership and
developer of Houston's Aerodrome. ``The only way to make it viable
was to have an anchor tenant.''
</P>
<P>
   DeAyala and former Houston Aeros co-owner Glenn D. Hart are
eyeing as the anchor an expansion team from the Western
Professional Hockey League.
</P>
<P>
   Laredo is one of three expansion teams the 15-member league
hopes to add by 2002, said WPHL spokesman Steve Cherwonak.
</P>
<P>
   As the nation's second-fastest growing city after Las Vegas _
bursting at the seams with construction, traffic and Mexican
commerce _ Laredo has many competing needs for its public dollars.
Most city council members and several key business leaders back the
arena, but some council members, joined by anti-tax campaigners and
advocates for the poor, are urging ``no'' votes, citing other
spending priorities.
</P>
<P>
   Whenever the arena debate erupts, invariably the term ``quality
of life'' surfaces. Many contend Laredo must move quickly to
provide more amenities for residents and visitors. But others say
water, sewerage, streets and other services should be improved
first.
</P>
<P>
   In the LareDOS weekly newspaper, which editorialized against the
plan, former Mayor Aldo Tatangelo said the council should address
the ``real issues in Laredo: a dirty river; the antiquated sewage
treatment plant built 70 years ago that is a health hazard;
substandard housing in all sectors of the city; 3,000 families
waiting for public housing; a city landscape covered with litter
and filth; creeks choked with tires and old appliances; abandoned
buildings; a work force that does not meet the skills criteria for
new businesses wishing to locate here. These are what I call
quality of life issues.''
</P>
<P>
   He and others doubt the arena can make ends meet, even with a
hockey franchise guaranteeing 35 home dates. Further, foes claim a
sales-tax increase would unfairly burden the city's poorest
residents, who might be unable to afford arena events.
</P>
<P>
   Mayor Betty Flores, a project supporter, said she is often
asked, ``What have you done for downtown? What have you done for
housing? Is this council just worried about putting in an
entertainment and sports venue?''
</P>
<P>
   Her short answer could be no, but instead Flores recited a
litany of $28.8 million in downtown improvements, including a
transit center, theater acquisition and parking lots; and $17.9
million in federal and other expenditures in the past five years
for new home construction, repairs and down-payment assistance.
</P>
<P>
   Flores said Laredo recently built a police station and two fire
stations and the law enforcement budget has increased 67 percent
since the mid-1990s. Since 1997, four recreation centers opened and
parks were expanded to 345 acres, she said. The bus and library
systems also were augmented, she added.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are a lot of issues that are being addressed by the city
council as we move along with this entertainment center,'' Flores
said at a contentious public hearing July 20. Chief among the
concerns is the city's long-term water supply, Flores said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Yes, we have spent a lot of time and a lot of effort on this
venue because the citizens of Laredo demanded it. They wanted it.
They asked us for it,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Flores emphasized that if the proposal is approved, the city
would have 180 days to agree with Arena Ventures on issues like
site acreage and rent. She's confident the investors will carry
their share of financial risk.
</P>
<P>
   Hart, who heads Michael Petroleum Corp., said he's been doing
business in Laredo since 1986, has witnessed its growth and is sure
it can support a hockey club. From 1994-96, Hart was founding owner
of the Aeros International Hockey League franchise. Currently, he
owns the company that holds the lease for the Compaq Center, home
of the Houston Rockets. Hart is also a limited partner of the New
Orleans Zephyrs AAA baseball club.
</P>
<P>
   Hart said even he had doubts about the viability of hockey in
South Texas.
</P>
<P>
   ``But one of the final pieces of the puzzle that made this
situation all come together in my mind was the fact that Corpus
Christi has a franchise in the WPHL, they've been in business for
two years and they've sold out every game in the history of the
franchise,'' Hart said.

<P>
   LAREDO: Hart said.
</P>
<P>
   ``This project is not about hockey,'' he insisted. ``It's about
a multipurpose entertainment center.
</P>
<P>
   ``The city has stated ... loud and clear that they do not want
to be at risk for the potential of operating the facility at a
financial loss. Arena Ventures has conclusively and clearly stepped
up to say that we are willing to take that financial risk,'' Hart
said.
</P>
<P>
   The WPHL's Cherwonak said a franchise in the border town of
Hidalgo will begin league play in 2001. Beaumont also is hoping to
enter the league, joining teams in Austin, San Angelo and several
smaller cities. But why is hockey catching on in Texas?
</P>
<P>
   ``We can point directly at Wayne Gretzky for leading the charge.
He really took the sport from being regional to being national and
international,'' Cherwonak said.
</P>
<P>
   ``In Laredo we've got a rock-solid ownership group, with
tremendous experience in business and sports. They'll have an
unrivaled facility. That right there gives us an excellent shot.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not going to say professional hockey or a new arena is
more important than hospital beds or a police force. Of course not.
But it is a quality of life issue that we hope to be a part of.''
</P>
<P>
   Plans call for the arena to be built in a booming area in
northeast Laredo on Bob Bullock Loop near Sinatra Parkway. The site
would be close to the airport and Laredo's Texas A&AMP;M International
University, although some residents prefer a downtown site.
</P>
<P>
   In an appeal to Laredoans' fierce pride, proponents have noted
that slightly larger Lubbock has three arenas. And to make the tax
increase more palatable, they have portrayed it as imperceptible.
For every $4 in taxable purchases, shoppers would contribute one
cent to the arena, pro-arena advertisements point out.
</P>
<P>
   But that's no bargain, said opponent Jaime Mendoza.
</P>
<P>
   ``Why should we, the poor people, pay a sales tax to help these
gentlemen from Houston to get rich,'' he asked council members.
</P>
<P>
   Rolando Raymond said he wouldn't object to the city developing
an arena on its own, but he doesn't want an independent operator
like Arena Ventures involved.
</P>
<P>
   ``The people of Laredo are so hungry for entertainment, they're
not looking at the deal,'' Raymond said.
</P>
<P>
   ``You're expecting us to pay for a $40.5 million
state-of-the-art facility, and then to simply hand it over to Arena
Ventures rent free, tax free ... and they get to keep all the
profits,'' Raymond said.
</P>
<P>
   But other Laredoans said the city is long overdue for a new
venue, something that would encourage residents to spend their
dollars at home rather than across the Rio Grande or in San Antonio
or Houston. Two proposals to build a new convention center were
defeated in the early 1990s, and now there's no adequate place for
large gatherings such as concerts and circuses, residents said.
</P>
<P>
   As resident Hector Ramirez put it, ``There's nothing to do here
but go to family reunions.''

STROGANOFF EXHIBIT REVEALS RICHES OF ICONOGRAPHY
</HEADLINE>
  (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
 By TARA DOOLEY 
 c.2000 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   FORT WORTH, Texas _ They are considered ``windows into heaven.''
</P>
<P>
   From gilded backgrounds, stylized images of Jesus Christ, the
Virgin Mother or a pantheon of saints meet the gaze of the
faithful.
</P>
<P>
   In the images, their eyes are large, their noses elongated and
their bodies rigid.
</P>
<P>
   But rather than offering lifelike representations of human
beings depicting religious themes, the icons of Eastern Orthodox
churches are conduits for the faithful to reach out to the divine.
</P>
<P>
   ``Icons are very crucial in terms of Eastern Orthodox
practice,'' said Scott Ruby, assistant curator of The Jewish Museum
of New York. ``... We believe that people who pray with them are
helped by them through the intercession of the saints or Christ or
the Virgin Mary.''
</P>
<P>
   As devoted members of the Eastern Orthodox church in Russia,
generations of the wealthy and influential Stroganoff family
contributed to the iconography of the church, their patronage
creating a body of work known as the Stroganoff school.
</P>
<P>
   Some of the icons of that school and others can be found in
``Stroganoff: The Palace and Collections of a Russian Noble
Family,'' through Oct. 1 at the Kimbell Art Museum in Fort Worth.
</P>
<P>
   ``The church in orthodoxy is considered an iconic pattern of the
kingdom of God,'' Ruby said. ``The icons that fill the church
reminds (us) of the work of God already accomplished in the
saints.''
</P>
<P>
   The word ``icon'' comes from a Greek word meaning image, said
Dean McKenzie, professor emeritus of art history at the University
of Oregon in Eugene.
</P>
<P>
   The use of religious images in Christianity dates to the first
century, when Christianity was literally an underground movement,
practiced in the catacombs.
</P>
<P>
   ``There was always the need to see, to visualize the basic
tenets of the Christian belief,'' McKenzie said.
</P>
<P>
   Initially, the images depicted were mostly scenes from the Old
Testament, he said. But gradually, images of Jesus, the Virgin Mary
and the early saints appeared.
</P>
<P>
   In the first Golden Age of the Byzantine Empire, the sixth
century, iconography flourished. Usually, these icons were painted
for altar panels, but some were painted on metal.
</P>
<P>
   This period was followed by the iconoclasm of the eighth
century, a period when icons were condemned and many of the images
were destroyed. The Orthodox church resolved the conflict in the
mid-ninth century, and the icons were restored to their roles in
the life of the church, McKenzie said.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike paintings of religious themes by masters of the Western
church _ or the Roman Catholic Church, which broke with the Eastern
church in the 11th century _ icon painters are not permitted to
interpret Christian themes, McKenzie said. Artists usually did not
sign their work.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the Eastern church, there was an obligation of the artist
to depict it (the scene) in the way it had been depicted before,''
he said.
</P>
<P>
   Today, icon painters still follow established patterns in
depicting images. The ritual of creating the icon requires that the
painters _ often monks _ have the materials and finished works
blessed by priests, McKenzie said.
</P>
<P>
   Still, schools of icon painting emerged, particular painters
gained recognition and deviations snuck in.
</P>
<P>
   For example, in the Stroganoff school, Nikifor Istomin Savin
became one of the masters, McKenzie said. And the Fort Worth
exhibit includes examples of icons painted by Savin, including one
that depicts St. George slaying the dragon.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, icon painters commissioned to produce work for
Stroganoff family chapels, homes or the family's Annunciation
Cathedral were not beyond making the icon resemble the guy paying
the bill. For example, an icon of St. Nikita, commissioned by a
member of the Stroganoffs, was altered from the depiction of a
warrior to show the saint as a wealthy prince, McKenzie said.
</P>
<P>
   But icons are hardly museum pieces in Orthodox churches.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, icons have a strong influence in the life of the
church, said the Rev. Luke Kontgas, priest at St. John the Baptist
Greek Orthodox Church in Euless, Texas.
</P>
<P>
   ``Most of us keep icons; we put them in our cars,'' Kontgas
said. ``The saints watch and protect us; they intercede for us.''
</P>
<P>
   For example, among the icons hanging on his office walls,
Kontgas keeps one of St. Luke and Jesus Christ. But believers also
often keep icons in their homes, he said, and churches are adorned
with them.
</P>
<P>
   In general, icons serve as teaching tools and as objects of
devotion, Kontgas said.
</P>
<P>
   Kontgas uses some of the many icons in St. John the Baptist to
illustrate the Gospels as he teaches Sunday school.
</P>
<P>
   The icons are a part of daily worship for many Orthodox
believers, Kontgas said. But it's not the images themselves that
are worshipped, he said. Instead, believers honor the saints or
scenes through the image represented in the icon, Kontgas said.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is a part of their religious life, part of their spiritual
life,'' he said.

AT LEAST 90 DEAD IN KASHMIR MASSACRES  
</HEADLINE>
  (EDS: This early version will be updated as needed.) 
 By BARRY BEARAK   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW DELHI, India _ In a killing spree remarkable even for the
bloodied mountains and forests of Kashmir, at least 93 people were
slain late Tuesday and early Wednesday in six separate massacres.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the dead were innocents: pilgrims on their way to pray
at a holy site, laborers working at a brick kiln, villagers
awakened from their beds and lined up for slaughter.
</P>
<P>
   To many in India, the cause of all this murder seemed
straightforward enough: a peace process begun last week by one
militant group has been deemed a contemptible betrayal by others,
requiring sabotage.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is clear that after the Hizbul Mujahideen called for a
cease fire and talks, other militant groups have been instructed by
Pakistan to step up their attacks on innocent and unarmed people,''
India's prime minister, Atal Behari Vajpayee, told parliament.
</P>
<P>
   He added, ``I will tell these terrorists that we will not bow
down to their threats.''
</P>
<P>
   But Pakistan, as well as several of the militant groups critical
of the recent peace initiative, denied any responsibility for the
multiple attacks.
</P>
<P>
   Pakistan's foreign ministry issued a blunt statement, asserting
that the blame may belong to India: ``On previous occasions,
terrorist acts aimed at civilians have been carried out by renegade
elements at the behest of the Indian security forces, to malign the
Kashmiri freedom struggle internationally.''
</P>
<P>
   Kashmir is as tragic as it is beautiful. Once the Himalayan
domain of a maharajah, it has been the source of a 53-year custody
battle between India and Pakistan _ and the direct cause of two of
the three wars fought between the countries since they gained
independence in 1947. Each country now occupies part of Kashmir,
though India's share is far larger and includes the valley that is
the heart of Kashmiri culture.
</P>
<P>
   Since 1989, Pakistani-backed militants have rebelled against
Indian rule. Some of these guerrillas favor an independent Kashmir
while others want the region to be joined with Pakistan. Some
groups are primarily Kashmiri, but others are mainly foreigners lit
with jihad, dedicated to wresting the predominantly Muslim land
from the grasp of largely Hindu India. An estimated 25,000 to
40,000 people have died in the fighting.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, the Hizbul Mujahideen _ one of the main insurgents
_declared a unilateral three-month cease fire, a surprise
announcement that brought an offer of talks from India and angry
condemnation from other Islamic militants in the fray.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   The Kashmir dispute is a deep morass, and while little common
ground would seem to exist between the Hizbul and India, plans for
discussions had seemed to be going forward _ and hence violent
efforts to derail the process could hardly be unexpected.
</P>
<P>
   ``Pakistan and its lackeys have stooped to the lowest point,
indulging in such barbaric acts to sabotage the peace process,''
Farooq Abdullah, the chief minister of the Indian state of Jammu
and Kashmir, heatedly charged Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   But many in India have presumed that the Hizbul Mujahideen would
not have declared a cease fire without at least the tacit approval
of Pakistan's military government, which has been under pressure
from the United States.
</P>
<P>
   Inflamed rhetoric aside, the attacks then raise questions about
whether Pakistan indeed favors the new dialogue _ and how much
capacity it has to control the militants.
</P>
<P>
   The recent attacks were particularly jarring and heinous _ and
the victims were overwhelmingly Hindu. In the worst incident,
gunmen opened fire on pilgrims on their way to a religious shrine
at Pahalgam, 55 miles south of Srinagar. The death toll in that
incident has risen to 33, according to hospital officials.
</P>
<P>
   In a small brick-making community near the town of Anantnag,
attackers forced people from their homes, lined up the men and shot
them. Eighteen died there.
</P>
<P>
   Curfews have since been imposed in parts of the state. The
authorities say they fear a violent Hindu backlash against Muslims.
</P>
<P>
   The Hizbul Mujahideen were loathe to suggest that any militant
groups took part in the massacres. Instead, the group's chief, Syed
Salahuddin, raised the heat under India's leaders, demanding that
they come to the negotiating table without any preconditions and
ready to discuss Kashmiri secession.
</P>
<P>
   He warned that even his group's guns would not stay silent
forever. ``Cease fire does not mean the giving up of jihad,'' he
warned. ``I'm sorry to say it means a breathing period.''

   CIR-ONLINE-SELLERS (Undated) _ Online sellers using auction
sites like eBay are even more vulnerable to fraud than online
buyers, experts say. Those who buy faulty or fake goods through
online auctions or Web shops have some recourse; insurance programs
and credit-card companies will often come to their rescue and
credit their accounts, at least up to a certain amount. But
individuals who are selling goods in online auctions have little
protection. Stolen credit cards, fake money orders and bounced

make Web information accessible without the need to boot up a
computer, some companies have a different plan. They are adapting
the Web to the one device that virtually everyone has: the
telephone. And they don't mean one of those Web phones that connect
you to e-mail and stock quotes after you set up a special
wireless-service account and scroll through a series of menus and
buttons. All you need is a telephone, even an old-fashioned rotary
dial phone. These voice portals _ like Tellme, BeVocal and
Quack.com _ let you pick up a phone and let your voice do the

They criticized the horizontal scrolling, the small type and the

Salon's editor, David Talbot, posted a note to readers saying,
``You win!'' and the site reverted to some of its old design. The

   FILM-COMPOSER (New York) _ Sitting in his 5.1 Surround format
sound studio installed in his newly renovated apartment on Hudson

comedy. ``I find it the most difficult thing,'' Burwell, 44, said.
``People on screen are happy _ the music is happy. People are sad _
the music is sad. I prefer a more ironic approach. If people are
being killed on screen, then I can be carefree,'' he said, speaking
musically. Burwell's latest deadline is ``Blair Witch 2,'' to be
released on Halloween. The scrupulously spare 3,000 square foot
loft that Burwell shares with his wife, Christine Sciulli, a
lighting designer and video artist is a creative contradiction in
terms: it conceals over five miles of analog and digital audio,
video and Ethernet cable and eleven electronic patch boxes that
allow Burwell to compose in the peace of his own apartment _

AN ARCHITECT EARNS THE RIGHT TO BUILD THE BLUES 
</HEADLINE>
   By HERBERT MUSCHAMP    
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Along with a room, the usual luxury amenities and a
gift shop stocked with beautiful books on Paris, guests at Sofitel,
the new hotel on West 44th Street, are rewarded with an unexpected
privilege. They get to participate in the education of an
architect. His name is Yann Leroy. He is a partner at the New York
firm Brennan Beer Gorman. He is 41. Sofitel is his solo,
stand-alone-building debut in Manhattan.
</P>
<P>
   The hotel is a coltish performance, more promising than
accomplished, of interest mainly on account of where it might lead
Leroy in the future and where it sits in relationship to his
bad-boy past.
</P>
<P>
   It takes most architects half a lifetime to build a stage. Leroy
is not the first to begin by setting up a soapbox in the street. In
1986, soon after moving to New York from Paris, he was like a one
man band against the city's architectural establishment. His
specialty was distributing leaflets outside lectures by prominent
practitioners like Michael Graves and Cesar Pelli. When the Museum
of Modern Art opened its ``Deconstructivist Architecture'' show in
1988, Leroy turned up on West 53rd Street to protest the Modern's
appropriation of ideas from a similar show that never got off the
ground but that was to have included his work.
</P>
<P>
   Actually, Leroy's experimental work at that time did not fit
comfortably within the deconstruction mold. Instead of the warped
planes and sliced diagonals featured at the Modern, Leroy used
biomorphic shapes that anticipated today's computer-driven blob
design. Leroy's design process, which involved computer-based
collaboration with colleagues overseas, was also ahead of its time.
</P>
<P>
   In contrast to his design work, Leroy's activism was charmingly
out of date. Did he think this was still 1968? In those ``Big
Chill'' years, many architects were trying to live down their
obstreperous student days. Along came Yann Leroy, popping up like
an old Jefferson Starship refrain: naive, independent, authentic
and mercifully not defanged.
</P>
<P>
   I first became aware of his work in 1987, in connection with a
show of designs for low-cost housing organized by the Architectural
League. Titled ``Vacant Lots,'' the show was the league's response
to the alarming rise in homelessness in the Reagan years. Leroy's
presentation was notable mainly for its graphic punch. In his
rendering, a study in washed-out, urban grays, the architecture was
pushed into the background behind a scene of urban violence.
Policemen stood in the rain around a shrouded corpse lying in the
street. The picture suggested that society prefers to solve the
homeless problem by killing people instead of housing them.
</P>
<P>
   You can detect a vestige of the ``Vacant Lots'' project in the
bow front of Sofitel's 44th Street facade. But I regret to report
that the edgy spirit of Leroy's polemical work is otherwise not in
evidence here. What is on view, however, is his ambition to become
a builder of New York, and this quality, given the architect's
ideological background, is worth noting. From sinister policemen to
white-gloved doormen is a stretch. Leroy has made it without
falling on his face. This is a pleasant surprise.
</P>
<P>
   The hotel is also yeoman's work. To my eye, it does not depart
substantially from the collage aesthetic that we've seen in Fox &AMP;
Fowle's Times Square skyscrapers (Conde Nast, Reuters) and other
recent towers in Midtown. This aesthetic was a yawn when Kohn
Pederson Fox used it for the Shearson Lehman tower in TriBeCa (the
one that now sports that red neon umbrella) and it has not perked
up since then.
</P>
<P>
   The collage for Sofitel recalls the traditional recipe for
bridal wear: something old, something new, something borrowed,
something blue. Here, old is represented by the hotel's base, a
four-story classical composition in French limestone. New is a
bow-shaped tower of blue glass, set back from 44th Street, that
rises 30 stories above the base. Flanking the tower are two
20-story, limestone-clad wings.
</P>
<P>
   The hotel's public spaces are borrowed, old and made me blue. A
sequence of lobby spaces has been designed to recreate the ambience
of upper-middle class apartments in the 16th Arrondissement:
gilt-framed mirrors, Empire-style tables and side chairs,
chandeliers. Gaby, the hotel restaurant, is decorated in an
unpersuasive Art Deco style. Its features include an actress who
enacts the role of the brasserie's namesake. Wearing a flapper
dress and a cloche hat, Gaby sashays around the premises waving a
long cigarette holder. Ask not, as Angus Wilson might have put it,
for whom the cloche tolls.
</P>
<P>
   Squint. If you can look beyond the period appointments, you will
see that the progression of ground floor spaces is good. You enter
through a small rotunda of a reception lobby that opens onto a
larger, rectangular area furnished with small tables, where drinks
are served. Directly ahead is a second rotunda, from which a grand
staircase ascends to a ballroom on the second floor. Make a left to
reach the check-in desk. Adjust sunglasses, walk swiftly through
Gaby, on the right, and exit on 45th Street. Call this procession
Boutique Monumental. But the organization of these spaces within
Sofitel's awkward, T-shaped site is the outstanding feature of
Leroy's design.
</P>
<P>
   Sofitel's 398 rooms are small but thoughtfully laid out.
Ship-shape. Rooms with bow windows, especially fine, but the suites
have one too many big TV sets for such diminutive accommodations.
</P>
<P>
   Inevitably, Sofitel will be compared to LMVH Tower, a more
successful Midtown high-rise design by the French architect
Christian de Portzamparc. In study models for his project,
Portzamparc also played with various combinations of drum and box
forms, with contrasts in glass and masonry cladding. But the design
didn't resolve itself until he abandoned this collage approach and
arrived at an all-glass facade unified by an overall composition of
free-form, organic contour.
</P>
<P>
   Leroy progressed in the opposite direction. In an early scheme,
Sofitel's two wings were clad in glass. The plan recalled a set of
residential towers Frank Lloyd Wright designed in 1928 for a site
adjacent to St. Mark's Church, in the East Village. Like Wright's,
Leroy's earlier plan emphasized the tower's horizontal dimension,
as well as the vertical. As built, the glass wings have turned to
limestone. Leroy has tried to give the wings a skyline silhouette,
thus creating a push-pull effect between the tower and its
surroundings. But an all-glass tower would have strengthened this
effect considerably.
</P>
<P>
   All of us now are feeling kindly again toward glass. But the
appeal of tinted blue glass escapes me. A gem in old small-town
drugstores, this material has become debased by overuse in the
lesser suburban office parks. The tint obstructs views of the
interior, especially the underside of the floor slabs. This is
particularly regrettable compared with all the supertransparent,
so-called white glass in recent French architecture.
</P>
<P>
   White glass exacerbates the problems of glass buildings: lack of
privacy, for instance, or the unsightliness of messy interiors.
Perhaps these objections should be turned around. What's so sightly
about contemporary cast stone facades? Even real stone often looks
trashy, the way it's used today. As for privacy, a good hotel
should always stock its rooms with extra towels.
</P>
<P>
   I've been tougher than I might have been on Sofitel because
Leroy is talented. I wasn't just being cute in suggesting that
clients often foot the bill for an architect's education. Early
work by Le Corbusier, Wright and Gehry bears this out. It's healthy
for architects to engage with bricks and mortar before they're
ready. That is how they mature.
</P>
<P>
   The city gets educated in the process. Sofitel's weaknesses are
mostly a result of prevailing wisdom on how new buildings should
relate to old ones. Low, limestone bases make good neighbors, etc.,
etc. Unless they don't. Put up. Don't shut up. That's the way
cities learn.

&HT;     FORMER SEMINARIAN TAKES PRIDE IN SEXUAL HARASSMENT CASE AGAINST
JESUITS 
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)   
 &HT;     By BOB EGELKO  
 &HT;     c. 2000 Hearst Newspapers   
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO - A former Berkeley seminarian settled his sexual
harassment suit against the Jesuits on confidential terms, but he
makes no secret of his pride in
</P>
<P>
   the case.
</P>
<P>
   ``Even though it resulted in losing every Jesuit friend I had
and other unforeseen consequences, I'm very glad I did it,'' John
Bollard said.
</P>
<P>
   ``The 9th Circuit decision, which will be on the books for the
foreseeable future, is unprecedented and opens doors for other
people who may be in the same situation.''
</P>
<P>
   Bollard was referring to a ruling last December by the 9th U.S.
Circuit Court of Appeals that reinstated his damage suit against
the Jesuit order in California and priests whom he accused of
pressuring him for sex.
</P>
<P>
   The court ruled that religious freedom does not protect a church
that sexually harasses its clergy. The ruling said a religious
organization could be held responsible for sexual harassment in the
workplace, like any other employer _ in contrast to previous
federal court rulings that protected churches from discrimination
suits by ministers and other religious employees.
</P>
<P>
   After their request for a rehearing was denied, the Jesuits
reached a mediated settlement with Bollard on July 18, just before
the deadline for their decision on whether to appeal to the Supreme
Court. The terms have not been disclosed.
</P>
<P>
   The settlement was first reported in Catholic San Francisco, the
archdiocese newspaper. Father Alfred Naucke, speaking for the
Jesuits, told the newspaper he was glad to have the case resolved,
as an alternative to ``years of potential litigation.''
</P>
<P>
   Bollard, 35, who works with students at a college in Southern
California, said he was also pleased the case is over.
</P>
<P>
   ``One of my goals was to have my story told and shed some light
on the issue, and that Jesuits take seriously the matter of sexual
harassment, this lack of authenticity and the hypocrisy,'' he said.

<P>
   ``Having been a Jesuit for eight years, I know the society and
I'm confident that they now are taking it much more seriously.''
</P>
<P>
   He said a number of Jesuits with similar histories had contacted
him after his case hit the media, including a ``60 Minutes''
segment last year.
</P>
<P>
   Bollard began his training in 1988 and studied at St. Ignatius
College Preparatory School in San Francisco and the Jesuit School
of Theology in Berkeley before leaving the order in 1996.
</P>
<P>
   In his suit, he said his supervisor invited him to gay bars and
sent him a pornographic card, and another priest gave him a
birthday card in 1991 showing a naked man and containing suggestive
language. In all, he said, a dozen priests, including the head of
the seminary, subjected him to unwelcome advances. He said his
complaints were brushed off.
</P>
<P>
   The Jesuits denied responsibility for any harassment, but sought
dismissal of the suit on the grounds that subjecting a religious
organization to civil rights laws in the treatment of clergy would
constitute government interference in religion.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. District Judge Susan Illston agreed and dismissed the case
in 1998. But in its 3-0 ruling last December, the appeals court
said a secular court could decide whether someone was sexually
harassed without intruding into questions of religious doctrine.

 &HT;    Gramm predicts big Bush victory
 &HT;    By Joe Murray
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHILADELPHIA _ Last time I talked with U.S. Sen. Phil Gramm
(R-Texas) I asked him about his dogs, knowing that his best old
hunting dog had recently passed on.
</P>
<P>
   Gramm talked at length, but never once asked me about how were
my dogs.
</P>
<P>
   I commented later to a mutual friend that maybe the senator had
been in Washington too long.
</P>
<P>
   You ask a man about his dogs, and he asks about yours. That's
common courtesy.
</P>
<P>
   Here in Philadelphia for the GOP national convention, I was able
to hook up with the senator by phone for an interview. First words
out of his mouth were:
</P>
<P>
   ``How're your dogs?''
</P>
<P>
   I'll say this for our Texas senator. When he knows he has made a
mistake, he'll make up for it.
</P>
<P>
   Last time, too, I had asked about the possibility of his being
Secretary of the Treasury if George W. Bush is elected president.
Gramm, who is chairman of the Senate Banking Committee, had
stressed that he had no ambition to join a Bush cabinet. But he
added something to this effect:
</P>
<P>
   ``I have served under every president since Carter, and I have
never refused anything the president has asked of me.''
</P>
<P>
   Hmm. Sounded like a ``maybe.'' So, in Philadelphia, I asked him
again: Anything to the speculation of the Treasury job:
</P>
<P>
   ``Nothing was there before and nothing is there now, that I know
of,'' he said. ``I'm not looking for a job, and I think I can help
George Bush best where I am. I'm happy doing the job I'm doing, and
I expect to be doing what I'm doing for some time to come.''
</P>
<P>
   Hmm. Wonder what he meant by, ``that I know of''?
</P>
<P>
   In any case, Gramm could be out of the job as banking committee
chairman if the Republicans fail to maintain a majority in the
Senate.
</P>
<P>
   He predicts they will prevail, but concedes the House is a
tossup. As for the presidency ...
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm expecting our governor to win by maybe double digits. I've
thought it all along, and I'm more convinced now than before. But I
know he'd be mad at me if he knew I was saying it.''
</P>
<P>
   Nothing frightens a candidate like overconfidence among his
supporters.
</P>
<P>
   Texans can't help but wonder what it would be like to have a
Texan back in the White House. LBJ saw to it that most everywhere,
even the smallest crossroads communities, got a new post office
building. Then, too, there was the matter of NASA headquarters
coming to Houston.
</P>
<P>
   Gramm will tell you that he thinks ``90 percent of the benefits
will come from his (Bush's) good policies, and that they will
affect not just Texas but all of the nation.''
</P>
<P>
   Having said that, he allowed this: ``There's no doubt having
George W. Bush in the White House will help Texas.''
</P>
<P>
   Gramm gives the example of the highway bill, in which he had
asked $700 million for the new I-69 through Texas, touted as the
dominate trade route between Mexico and Canada, second only to the
parallel I-35.
</P>
<P>
   ``I expected we'd get half that money.'' he said. ``But with
Clinton, we got 10 percent.''
</P>
<P>
   Once Bush is in office, Gramm says ``we'll get our half.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Out of fairness,'' he said, ``we should get half.''
</P>
<P>
   Texas can also look to a fair share of military contracts under
Bush.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're going to rebuild national defense, which has been cut 20
percent by Clinton, and I believe we'll be a beneficiary of that.''
</P>
<P>
   He was quick to add: ``We're not going to do it because it helps
Texas but because it helps the world.''
</P>
<P>
   Gramm also predicted:
</P>
<P>
   ``We are going to use about 40 percent of the Social Security
surplus to cut taxes, to give some of this money back to the people
who earned it in the first place, and to eliminate the death tax
and the marriage tax, letting people put more money into their
retirement.
</P>
<P>
   ``Obviously, I'm going to be able to appoint federal judges and
get more done for the state and the country.''
</P>
<P>
   For Gramm, it will be nice to again have a president to whom he
can feel personally close.
</P>
<P>
   It's a relationship, he said, he has had with every other
president he's served under.
</P>
<P>
   ``But I've never felt personally close to Clinton, and I'm sorry
that's the case.'' Much of the reason, he said, is due to Clinton's
``own problems.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I guess I'm like my mom is,'' Gramm said. ``Most Americans
want to feel good about their president whether they agree with him
or not.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've known George W. most of his life. It's exciting for
someone who's your friend to be president.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not something that happens often in a lifetime,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   P.S. It wasn't until after we hung up that I remembered I should
have asked about his mom. A man mentions his mom, it's just common
courtesy to ask how she's doing. Maybe I've been in Philadelphia
too long.

   NUTSNBOLTS _ There seemed to be fireplace inserts and wood
stoves everywhere during the 1970s and 1980s. More recently
high-tech gas fireplaces seem to be dominant.
</P>
<P>
   This week we answer a question from a family that has gotten rid
of its old fireplace insert. (Cummings, Dayton Daily News). 27.
</P>
<P>
   GARDENING-LIFE _ Orchids really have a hold on me. It's been a
while since I've been in an orchid period, about five or six years.
Like many orchid dabblers, I'd enjoy the blooms for months and then
I'd watch the plants just sit there for the next year or so. Now, I
have returned to orchids with zeal, if not skill. So go the rhythms
of gardening. You embrace a plant, then you let it go, returning to
embrace it again, perhaps years later. (May, Atlanta
Journal-Constitution.) WITH PHOTOS.

   CUT-CORNERS _ ATLANTA _ Jackie Cottrill of Atlanta knows how to
cut corners _ and, more importantly, when not to. After all, she
has decorated and designed, 18 houses for her family over the last
25 years. Yet she's not a professional designer or decorator; she's
a homemaker who's learned dozens of tricks of the trade by working
closely with architects, builders and other experts. Story

   BOOKNOTES _ Linda Howard has come a long way from her first
literary effort about children lost in the wilderness. Of course,
the Alabama writer was only nine at the time, and her audience
consisted of her family. Since then she has attracted a larger

<P>
   AZLE, Texas _ Inside tiny Wesley Chapel Christian Methodist
Episcopal Church, a choir of six children boldly sings: ``Watch ye,
therefore, you know not the day that the Lord will call your soul
away.''
</P>
<P>
   From the pulpit, the Rev. T.M. Berry listens carefully to the
melodic voices, most of which belong to his grandchildren. His
daughter, Sheryl Kimble, almost rocks the church with her forceful
piano playing.
</P>
<P>
   Never mind that only 10 people are in the congregation this
scorching summer day. That's regular attendance at Wesley Chapel,
the only African-American church in Azle, with only about 20
members on its rolls. So small is the congregation, it gathers only
twice a month, the first and third Sundays.
</P>
<P>
   Never mind the storied megachurches with tens of thousands of
members, state-of-the-art audiovisual equipment and
multimillion-dollar budgets. Members of the small white brick
church in a grove of trees on Park Street are fiercely loyal,
faithful and dedicated.
</P>
<P>
   ``I love my church,'' says 73-year-old Margaret Crump of Azle,
the oldest member of the nearly 100-year-old church. ``It ain't but
a few of us, but I come on anyway.''
</P>
<P>
   On this particular Sunday, half the worshippers at the 11 a.m.
service are guests. Most of the members are in their 40s or older.
</P>
<P>
   With so few members, congregants have to double up on duties or
bear assignments alone.
</P>
<P>
   On the recent Sunday, Berry doubles as Sunday school teacher,
the only one needed for the class of four. During church, a single
usher greets worshippers at the door, and at the appointed time,
Crump quietly rises to pass the offering plate.
</P>
<P>
   From its beginning as a worship place for ex-slaves, Wesley
Chapel has been small but has served as the spiritual center for
the few blacks who live in and around Azle.
</P>
<P>
   Ex-slaves are responsible for founding the entire denomination.
In 1870, 41 delegates, angry over the interracial Methodist
Episcopal Church's refusal to condemn slavery, created a separate
denomination, the Colored Methodist Episcopal Church. It became
Christian Methodist Episcopal Church in 1966.
</P>
<P>
   In October, Wesley Chapel will celebrate its 100th anniversary.
The church began in a brush arbor across the street from its
current location and has twice served as a school. This is the
second church on the present site.
</P>
<P>
   Glenda Smith, who has lived in Azle all of her life and attended
Wesley Chapel during that time, says her grandparents helped found
the church. Crump is her aunt.
</P>
<P>
   The coming anniversary helps her to remember the struggles of
those who went before her.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everybody had four or five hats they wore to keep the church
doors open,'' Smith says. ``My mother told me that when you go to
church, go prepared. You never know when you're going to be on
program. My mom was president of the Mission Society up until the
day she died.''
</P>
<P>
   Smith reminisced about a time when ``dinner on the grounds''
meant tables of food outside, underneath the trees _ not in the
church cafeteria, as it is today.
</P>
<P>
   Crump says she also remembers a simpler time in Azle.
</P>
<P>
   ``There was a time when you had to yell across the way to your
neighbor,'' she says.
</P>
<P>
   Azle once had two predominantly black churches, Wesley Chapel
and a Baptist church, which has since folded.
</P>
<P>
   With so few African-Americans around Azle, young people move to
find more diverse communities, Smith says. Of the 9,750 Azle
residents, an estimated 0.8 percent are African-American.
</P>
<P>
   ``When kids grew up and began to see we didn't have things like
the other churches, some began to move to Fort Worth,'' Smith says.
</P>
<P>
   Crump said she, too, has spent her life living between Fort
Worth and Azle.
</P>
<P>
   ``I love my church,'' she says. ``It's the only church I've ever
belonged to. Just like when a child leaves his parents, they always
come back.''
</P>
<P>
   Crump says she knew Berry long before he was appointed pastor 10
years ago.
</P>
<P>
   Berry was assigned to Azle at a life stage when many ministers
are enjoying retirement.
</P>
<P>
   A man with graying hair and glasses, Berry wears a simple black
suit with a gold lapel pin that reads ``Try God.'' When greeting
members and guests between services, he often hugs them.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's dedicated,'' says Gail Berry, the pastor's granddaughter
and a frequent visitor to Wesley Chapel. ``He's always here through
the week; he's always cleaning up. He's here more than he is at
home. I just know he's a God-sent person.''
</P>
<P>
   Berry said he spends most weeks visiting the many older, infirm
members who cannot attend Sunday service.
</P>
<P>
   He takes praises of his work in stride.
</P>
<P>
   ``My responsibility is to try to help those that are in need,
whether they be black or white,'' he says. ``My job is to preach
the word to every creature. My job is to have my doors open to
those that will come.''
</P>
<P>
   Berry's assignment to Wesley has become a family affair.
</P>
<P>
   ``I like to come out here to praise the Lord,'' says his
13-year-old granddaughter, Cnae Gray of Fort Worth. ``I like the
openness and I like to support my grandpa.''
</P>
<P>
   However, even those who are not related to Berry say Wesley
Chapel members feel like family.
</P>
<P>
   A few, such as Jearlene Releford of Fort Worth, say they have
regular churches but like to visit the tiny Azle church.
</P>
<P>
   ``I feel like it's a family-oriented environment,'' says
Releford, who has visited Wesley Chapel for about 20 years. ``You
can adjust better than going to a church where the minister doesn't
even know your name.''
</P>
<P>
   The church rolls contain only the names of African-Americans,
but white Azle residents also visit.
</P>
<P>
   Azle Mayor Leck Heflin, a minister at a nondenominational
church, has visited several times and has preached at the church.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of them are longtime friends _ schoolmates,'' Heflin
says. ``They've always been appreciated and respected in the
community. The historical significance of that small community has
significance to our whole community.''
</P>
<P>
   Because of its amicable relationship with the community, church
members weren't very concerned when they discovered ``KKK'' painted
on the outside walls one day recently. Church leaders put the
graffiti down to a prank rather than vandalism and racial hatred.
</P>
<P>
   The young suspect arrested in the incident insisted that he
painted the letters on a lark, not because of racial hatred.
</P>
<P>
   The Wesley Chapel members expect no further incidents.
</P>
<P>
   ``She's come through many a storm, but she's a good church,''
Smith says. ``She's shook from side to side, but she's still
standing. I love this old place.'' &QL;

   GARDENING-LIFE _ Orchids really have a hold on me. It's been a
while since I've been in an orchid period, about five or six years.
Like many orchid dabblers, I'd enjoy the blooms for months and then
I'd watch the plants just sit there for the next year or so. Now, I
have returned to orchids with zeal, if not skill. So go the rhythms
of gardening. You embrace a plant, then you let it go, returning to
embrace it again, perhaps years later. (May, Atlanta

<P>
   EAST HAMPTON, N.Y. _ They say a boat is a hole in the water you
dump money into, and Billy Joel has emptied his wallet many times.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a disease,'' he said last week from the deck of his
65-foot yacht, the Islander, moored in East Hampton's Three Mile
Harbor. ``I don't know how I'd kick it.''
</P>
<P>
   It's unlikely he'll ever try. Long before stepping into the
recording studio and selling more than 100 million records, Joel
began his nautical career by swimming out to other people's
moorings off the North Shore and ``borrowing'' their boats. He has
owned many since and now also lures other millionaires into the
boater's morass with a high-end speedboat he helped design, called
the Shelter Island Runabout _ with a base price of $300,000. A
stereo to blast Joel's sentimental song of the sea, ``The
Downeaster `Alexa,''' will set you back an additional $1,900.
</P>
<P>
   This day, under an extraordinary blue sky, Joel, 51, hopped
barefoot about the deck of his yacht as though his true calling
were the sea, not MTV. Peter Needham, who builds the 36-foot
runabouts, had just roared across Gardiners Bay in one to take the
singer to lunch. Joel busied himself catching lines so he and Trish
Bergin, a 29-year-old news reporter for Long Island's Channel 12
who shares his stateroom these days, could board. Then he paused to
smile down at the speedboat like a proud parent, admiring its
celadon hull and upholstery white enough to blind a Modernist.
</P>
<P>
   Joel's ideas for the boat's graceful lines were drawn from Long
Island lobster boats. And the idea of keeping it fast came from the
large commuter yachts that industrialists like J.P. Morgan used to
speed from Great Neck to Wall Street in less than an hour. Joel,
who has no training in design, began by sketching on the proverbial
cocktail napkin, in consultation with Needham. A naval architect
translated their ideas for a lightweight, fast boat into detailed
blueprints.
</P>
<P>
   Joel owns the patent on the hull design, and collects a royalty
on every runabout that Needham builds _ about seven a year _ at his
Coecles Harbor Marina on Shelter Island. The first boat was
christened in 1996. Now, the yard employs 14 carpenters and
electricians.
</P>
<P>
   At midcentury, Long Island was home to dozens of mom and pop
boat builders, but Joel can name only four other companies now in
business. So he takes great pride in having revived boat building
on the East End.
</P>
<P>
   The same people who buy mansions buy boats. Recently, one man
ordered a 50-foot version at $1.5 million. But most people are
satisfied with the regular model, which can hit 48 knots (about 55
miles per hour). That's perfect for the mogul who wants to crack
lobsters in Newport, followed by a swim off Block Island before
heading back to East Hampton for the evening. At a mile a gallon of
gasoline at top speed, the twin 415 horsepower MerCruiser motors
would make an SUV owner feel saintly. With Joel offering his hand,
Bergin stepped gamely aboard Needham's runabout in clunky, heeled
sandals, ready to cruise.
</P>
<P>
   ``I neglected to bring my boating shoes,'' she said, with a
pronounced Long Island accent. With her puffy lips and sparkling
eyes, Bergin appears to possess the same television-friendly genes
as Deborah Norville. Joel, with his T-shirt, chinos and sun-baked
cragginess, looks more like the guy who would clean the fish for
you once you got dockside. Still, they make a good pair.
</P>
<P>
   As Joel took the helm, Bergin said, ``I'm a good mate, aren't I
Billy?'' He laughed and set the boat in motion.
</P>
<P>
   Bergin and Joel met five years ago when she interviewed him for
a news program. She's a South Shore girl and he's a North Shore boy
_ a few miles inland in Levittown _ and they got along well. But
they didn't start dating until a few months ago.
</P>
<P>
   ``I got married first, and then I got divorced,'' Bergin said.
</P>
<P>
   That's when Christie Brinkley, Joel's wife until 1994 and a
friend of Bergin, called Joel to say, ``Did you notice that Trish
isn't wearing a wedding ring anymore?'' Joel asked Bergin out.
</P>
<P>
   Now, the two spend much of their free time out on the water,
trying, often unsuccessfully, to escape notice. ``People come out
of nowhere,'' Joel said. Pointing across the harbor to the
photographer Patrick Demarchelier's house, he added, ``One day that
guy came screaming up to us in his boat saying, `Billeee, tout le
bla bla bla.' I couldn't understand a word.'' His challenge one
recent day was slipping past the crowds at the waterfront East
Hampton Point restaurant. With its teak details and classic look,
Joel's runabout is so distinctive that it's not the boat for
shrinking violets.
</P>
<P>
   ``Even sailboaters who look down their noses at all powerboats
wave to this one,'' Joel said, as the restaurant came into view.
Two other Shelter Island Runabouts were tied up near the
restaurant, looking distinguished and serene in the ostentatious
flotilla of fiberglass and chrome.
</P>
<P>
   During lunch, a couple more passed in the harbor. Needham
remembers the details of each one. He becomes so attached to the
boats while building them, he said, that he cried the first time he
had to ship one off to a Microsoft millionaire.
</P>
<P>
   ``I knew I'd never see it again,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Most buyers add custom woodwork, upholstery, tuna towers and
other extras that easily raise the price to $10,000 a linear foot.
</P>
<P>
   Although the excess of tropical hardwoods makes the galley and
cabin feel luxurious, the space holds little more than a microwave,
a refrigerator and a sink, with room in the bow for two to sleep in
a pinch. (Joel designed the head twice as large for comfort.) Some
owners hire interior designers to tweak the teak, but the clean
design doesn't take well to froufrou.
</P>
<P>
   ``Over the years, I've developed a pretty good idea of what a
boat should look like,'' Joel said. ``And it shouldn't look like
you started with the screening room and designed out from that.
It's also easy to overyacht a boat with too much nautical stuff. I
see those curtains printed with anchors, and every light fixture
designed like an old boat lamp, and I want to say, `Hey, I get the
point _ we're on the water!'''
</P>
<P>
   While Shelter Island Runabout owners will probably never drag a
bleeding swordfish up over the transom, Joel likes that utilitarian
illusion. It's all part of his workingman fantasies. For years,
he's been identified as a friend to bay men on the East End. He's
fought, unsuccessfully by and large, to preserve their fishing
lifestyle, and he's done countless benefits for local causes. But
the reality is that nostalgic millionaires are snapping up Joel's
surrealistic versions of the old fishing boats just as the bay men
are disappearing into history.
</P>
<P>
   This partly explains why Joel recently sold his East Hampton
estate, complete with a collection of boats on the lawn, to Jerry
Seinfeld, after more than a decade of living year-round on the
South Fork.
</P>
<P>
   ``Jerry asked me, did I want to sell the place,'' Joel said. ``I
threw out a number and he said OK. So I asked my daughter, `Should
I sell this house?' And she said, `Daddy, change is good.'''
</P>
<P>
   She wasn't talking small change _ $34 million. Joel is looking
for a waterfront place on the North Shore. ``As celebrity spotting
became a sport, it became hard for me to leave my driveway on
weekends,'' he said.

EAST HAMPTON, N.Y.: weekends,'' he said.  
<TEXT>
<P>
   A commotion in the restaurant caused him to look up. ``Hey,
there's Alexa,'' he said of his teen-age daughter, his face
brightening. Alexa and her mother's blond mane came into view
across the room. Cameras flashed as Joel reminded Alexa to remember
her passport for an upcoming trip. Two women nearby suddenly felt
the need to videotape. Bergin asked Brinkley about her new yacht, a
cute but respectable work boat she recently bought, which clearly
shows Joel's influence. Alexa then took her mother off to the
powder room for a makeup session.
</P>
<P>
   A waitress appeared at Joel's side, looking nervous. ``I know
people must say this to you all the time,'' she said. ``But your
music has been the soundtrack to my entire life. And I hope you'll
keep making more of it so I can have something to get married to,
to have my babies to.''
</P>
<P>
   Joel replied kindly, ``I will. Although I don't know if you'll
like it. I'm composing classical music now.''
</P>
<P>
   The waitress looked puzzled. She hadn't heard about this sea
change.
</P>
<P>
   In the distance, the Islander putted out of the harbor, heading
for Connecticut, where Joel rents it out. Needham piloted the
runabout to a pier, where Joel's and Bergin's car waited. Then,
Needham headed back toward Shelter Island, throttle wide open,
waving to yachtsmen all the way. It was a Sunday, and his crew was
working overtime. Another millionaire was expecting his new boat on
Thursday, and the bow wasn't quite ready for a Veuve Clicquot
christening.

<P>
   For adults with aging or infirm parents, determining what type
of care their parents need can be a complicated, multilayered
process. Several new sites, like AccentCare.com and CareThere.com,
help families do that and even keep daily or weekly track of the
care their relatives are receiving.
</P>
<P>
   AccentCare.com, of Irvine, Calif., started a Web site in May
that helps consumers determine the appropriate care through an
online questionnaire about the relative's medical history,
independence in daily activities and mental state. The company
offers services only to California and Arizona residents but is
forming affiliate agreements with agencies in other states. (The
agencies will be listed on the Web site.) If it is determined that
the relative can remain at home, AccentCare refers California and
Arizona residents to care providers from its own 13 branches or an
affiliate agency.
</P>
<P>
   Although AccentCare does not refer registered nurses, it offers
services like grocery shopping, coordinating of doctor visits and
keeping track of the client's medication. It's possible to arrange
the care online, but most people choose to call a care manager to
talk about obtaining references and scheduling hours.
</P>
<P>
   Once care is arranged, AccentCare sends updates to family
members from reports filled out by the care provider.
</P>

   ``AccentCare is unique in that they own the brick-and-mortar
centers,'' said Rachel Terrace, an analyst at Jupiter
Communications in New York. ``But the challenge will be maintaining
quality control of their staff as they expand into other states.''
AccentCare has 1,300 employees.
</P>
<P>
   Caryn Jacoby, a sales executive in New York, has hired several
AccentCare employees to take care of her mother, who lives in San
Francisco and has Alzheimer's disease. (In June, AccentCare
acquired the Tammy DeCarlo Agency in San Francisco, the agency
Jacoby had been using since 1997.)
</P>
<P>
   Jacoby said she usually talked to her mother once a day and was
setting up a family page with AccentCare to keep in touch with the
care provider. ``I can't talk to the caregiver without her thinking
something is wrong,'' Jacoby said, ``so this is a way of finding
out what's going on directly.''
</P>
<P>
   Jacoby said that because she was often out of the office for
many hours each day, staying in contact with the care provider via
e-mail would also make her life easier. ``The fact that I can
e-mail someone with a question and have it returned that day is
wonderful,'' she said. ``I'll be able to do it from home and from
work.''
</P>
<P>
   Kenneth Kleinberg, a health analyst with the Gartner Group,
based in Stamford, Conn., said wireless communications would
further help care providers stay in contact with their agency and
relatives of their client. ``There's a huge boon to the caregiver
with wireless devices, and it's long in coming,'' he said.
``Handheld devices will let them check in on the spot.''
</P>
<P>
   But the concept of families keeping tabs on the care their
parent's receive, even if they live across the country, will have
to be backed by service agreements, Kleinberg added. ``It should be
understood that the caregiver will read an e-mail within a few
hours, not after a few days,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   AccentCare is also talking with companies that keep electronic
medical records about involving doctors in online communications,
said Joe Davis, president of AccentCare. The family member viewing
updates from the caregiver on his page, for example, could also
receive updates from doctors after visits. ``The capability is
there, but for whatever privacy or liability reasons, the medical
community has so far been slow to adopt,'' Davis said.
</P>
<P>
   CareThere.com, a site based in Mountainview, Calif., started in
July and offers decision-making help in the form of legal and
financial information, and forums where people can exchange
information and advice. CareThere offers lists of specific
resources, as AccentCare does, but it doesn't own any of the care
agencies it lists.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. George Savage, president and chief executive of CareThere,
said the site was designed to let relatives of patients rate the
care being given. Elder-care agencies will be able to display their
quality ratings in CareThere's directory.
</P>
<P>
   ``The caregiving industry is so fragmented,'' Savage said, ``and
there's such an imbalance with demand and supply that people who
aren't that good go from job to job making the same money. This
will be a good way to rate individual caregivers.''
</P>
<P>
   Savage said CareThere also serves as a place for care agencies
to send e-mail updates to families. ``In the past, it's been nearly
impossible to get feedback from an agency because it's so labor
intensive,'' he said. ``Now, as the agency types in a report, part
of that can be sent as an e-mail message to the family.''
</P>
<P>
   Companies like AccentCare that refer care providers from
businesses they own or from affiliates might exclude other
resources available to consumers, said Kathleen Kelly, executive
director of the Family Caregiver Alliance, a nonprofit group in San
Francisco that publishes a directory of care resources available in
California. ``My observation is that most of the caregiver sites
that are trying to create a large-scale national database don't
always include state-funded or community-based programs,'' she
said. ``They're a good starting place, but they won't meet the
needs of everyone.''
</P>
<P>
   Such sites should not be the sole resource for finding support,
said Suzanne Mintz, president and co-founder of the National Family
Caregiver's Association, a nonprofit organization in Kensington,
Md. ``Once you get the name of a company, you still need to get
references and ask questions about your own particular needs,'' she
said.
</P>
<P>
   At the very least, Mintz said, the decision-making tools on
sites like CareThere and AccentCare help people to think about what
kind of care their parents need or may need in the future.
</P>
<P>
   ``People are beginning to understand that at some point, elder
care is going to be part of their family's life,'' she said. ``The
caregiver sites help you think about planning ahead.''

 PUTTING PHOTOS OF WARES ONTO eBAY AUCTION SITE  
 (Circuits)  
 By J.D. BIERSDORFER    
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Q. I am a computer novice and would like to sell items on the
eBay auction site. How do I add pictures of the items I wish to
sell? &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A. To display pictures of your wares on the eBay site, you must
have electronic copies of the photographs. Using a digital camera
to take the photographs makes it relatively simple to upload the
files to your computer and will save some steps.
</P>
<P>
   If you do not have access to a digital camera, you can take
regular photographs and convert them into digital files with a
scanner.
</P>
<P>
   If you do not have a scanner, you can have your photographs
scanned at a copy shop or desktop-publishing outlet.
</P>
<P>
   Once you have the electronic copies, there are several ways to
place them on the eBay site. The site itself offers a thorough
tutorial on the subject at
pages.ebay.com/help/basics/phototut-index.html. The site is also
testing a photo-display program for some categories, like pottery
and glass, which might help simplify the process.
</P>
<P>
   Q. I have a computer running Windows 98 that I wish to sell to a
friend. How can I make sure none of my personal files and Internet
cookies are left on the machine before I give it to him? &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A. Security experts say that it is truly difficult to erase
files completely from a hard drive, but for most people, the tools
offered by DOS or third-party programs like Norton Utilities or the
Eraser freeware (www.tolvanen.com/eraser/download.html, recommended
for advanced users) are adequate.
</P>
<P>
   Although it may take some additional time, one reasonably safe
way to prepare the computer for its new owner is to erase and
reformat the hard drive and reinstall Windows 98.
</P>
<P>
   You should make sure that all your personal documents and
Web-browser favorites have been copied to your new computer before
you erase the contents of the old one.
</P>
<P>
   For one basic reformatting method, all you need is a blank
floppy disk and your Windows 98 CD-ROM. With the floppy, make a
bootable startup disk that can be used to start the computer before
reformatting. (Go to the Start menu, to Settings, then to Control
Panel and double-click on Add/Remove programs to see the StartUp
Disk tab and instructions.)
</P>
<P>
   Start the computer from the floppy to make sure that it works
and that you have the ``Start computer with CD-ROM support'' option
before continuing. Starting the computer from the floppy disk is
recommended so that you can still boot the computer if something
goes wrong, and to sidestep any viruses that might be on the hard
drive.
</P>
<P>
   You should also have the original disks for your video card,
modem and other hardware ready to reinstall.
</P>
<P>
   After booting the PC from the floppy (and again opting for the
``CD-ROM support'' menu choice), you can use the DOS ``format c:''
command to erase the drive's contents. The on-screen prompts will
warn you that all your data will be lost. The formatting process
takes about 15 minutes for a two-gigabyte drive. If you have other
drives, you should also format those. After formatting, type the
command ``setup'' after the letter of your CD-ROM drive (usually D:
or E:) at the prompt to begin installing Windows 98 from the CD.
</P>
<P>
   That is one basic way to reformat and reinstall. The ZDNet Web
site (www.zdnet.com) has a good Help and How-To section that can
offer more details, along with other tips. Microsoft's Knowledge
Base on the Web (search.support.microsoft.com) might also help to
answer questions about reinstalling the system.
</P>
<P>
   A freshly installed version of Windows 98 will ensure that your
buyer starts with a clean machine. If you are selling any old
programs along with the computer, you should reinstall those by
using the original disks, and be sure to give the computer's new
owner all of the floppy disks, CD-ROM's, manuals and serial numbers
for the software.
</P>
<P>
   Circuits invites questions about computer-based technology, by
e-mail to Q&AMP;A(at)nytimes.com or mail to Questions, Circuits, The
New York Times, 229 West 43rd St., New York, N.Y. 10036-3959. This
column will answer questions of general interest, but letters
cannot be answered individually.

FOR MAC USERS, HELP FROM AN UNLIKELY QUARTER 
</HEADLINE>
   By PETER H. LEWIS    
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   It's never easy living as a Mac user in a Windows world, but it
is a lot easier than it used to be. Microsoft, maker of Windows,
was once thought to be Apple's greatest enemy. I will admit to
referring to Microsoft as ``the Borg'' (taken from the dominating
alien race on ``Star Trek: The Next Generation'') in those dark
days of '97 when Apple's future looked shaky. But then things got
better.
</P>
<P>
   Instead of trying to squash the Mac, Microsoft has actually spun
off a unit to create Mac software from the ground up, instead of
merely recycling old Windows code into Mac versions of its
programs. Microsoft's Internet Explorer 4.5 browser for the Mac
featured many techno-goodies, like a page-print preview option,
that were not included in the concurrent Windows versions, and
Internet Explorer 5 for Mac has even more.
</P>
<P>
   The Mac version of Microsoft's Office suite, which includes the
Word 98 word-processing program, Excel 98 for spreadsheets and the
PowerPoint 98 presentation program, also had features that didn't
appear on the other platform until the release of Office 2000 for
Windows. At the Macworld exhibition in New York last month, I saw a
demonstration of Microsoft's Office 2001 for Macintosh, which
featured some enticing additions like Entourage, an e-mail and
personal-information manager that can be fully integrated with
current Office programs and can synchronize with Palm organizers.
</P>
<P>
   Toolbars and icons within the Office suite have been redesigned
to make them more intuitive and Mac-like, and QuickTime movie clips
can be easily incorporated into PowerPoint presentations. Microsoft
Office 2001, available only for Macs, is due in October. More
information is available at www.microsoft.com/mac.
</P>
<P>
   Computers are all about communication in one form or another,
and having your Mac files be compatible with Windows files from the
ubiquitous Office suite is often a real concern among those of us
in Clan Macintosh. Microsoft promises that Office 2001 will sustain
``seamless compatibility'' with Windows Office 2000, which means
that a Mac user can write a memo in Word 2001 and send it as an
e-mail attachment to a Windows user running Word 2000 and magical
things will happen _ the file will open with no problems and all
the formatting will be intact. The Save As dialogue box in Word
2001 will even let Mac users save their files with a three-letter
Windows file extension appended to it, making things move even more
smoothly between the two systems.
</P>
<P>
   Not every document I get has been sent in a Windows Office
format _ some are in WordPerfect by Corel or the AppleWorks
software, and I also receive graphics, spreadsheet and database
files that are not Mac-friendly. I usually run those types of
hard-to-open files through my copy of Mac-Link Plus, by DataViz
(www.dataviz.com). That little $99 lifesaver will convert just
about any text, graphics or spreadsheet file into something my Mac
can read. It will also convert my own files into formats that a
Windows user can probably handle.
</P>
<P>
   Third-party software like Mac-Link Plus is designed to bridge
the gap between the two systems. But helpful software is sometimes
right there in the Mac operating system. Mac users have been able
to read and use PC-formatted floppy disks on their machines for
years, thanks to the system's PC Exchange utility, even if they
have to buy an external floppy drive to do so.
</P>
<P>
   The small size of my New York apartment will not allow me to
indulge my dream of having several computers scattered around, all
running different operating systems. For those times when I
absolutely have to use Windows at home (for, say, one of those
genealogy programs that come with what seems like 47 CD-ROM's, all
of them Windows only), I resort to Virtual PC 3.0 from the
Connectix Corp. (www.connectix.com).
</P>
<P>
   Virtual PC, which will emulate a Windows system on your Mac and
let you run Windows-only software, is for users willing to part
with roughly $180 and more than 500 megabytes of hard drive space
to store the program. It runs more slowly than a real Windows
system, but you can configure the settings to make your Mac's ports
function like those on a PC running Windows.
</P>
<P>
   You can drag and drop graphics and files from the Mac desktop
onto the Virtual PC faux-Windows desktop and open them. The program
also lets a Mac user surf the Web and get e-mail while in Windows
mode without bothering with dial-up or network settings. Virtual PC
comes in five versions: Windows 95, 98 and 2000; PC-DOS; and Red
Hat Linux for the especially adventurous.
</P>
<P>
   For current news, reviews and Mac-related information, I
regularly check the MacInTouch (www.macintouch.com) and Mac
Observer (www.macobserver.com) Web sites. For example, the Mac
Observer recently reported that 3dfx, a maker of powerful graphics
cards for PC gamers, had released its first made-for-the-Mac add-in
card. Fans of game-playing on the Mac will probably be cheered by
this news, as well as by the fact that Blizzard Entertainment just
released the Mac version of its popular game Diablo II
(www.blizzard.com), less than a month after the PC version's debut.
For Mac gamers, that's progress.
</P>
<P>
   Recognizing the demand for software, other companies that
produce Windows software are beginning to release the Mac versions
around the same time. Grolier Interactive (www.grolier.com), which
makes the robust Grolier Multimedia Encyclopedia reference suite on
CD-ROM, plans to release the 2001 Mac version of the suite just a
week or so after the Windows version hits the shelves in early
September. And some companies are still making great software just
for the Mac, like the SoundJam MP program by Casady &AMP;
Greene(www.soundjammp.com), which gives the Apple faithful a
full-featured program for creating and playing MP3 music files.
</P>
<P>
   I will also be scouring the Web for news of Mac OS X (as in 10),
the long-awaited revamping of Apple's operating system. The
drumbeats have been sounding about it for years, and Apple plans to
release a public beta version for impatient Mac-heads to play with.
Mac OS X includes enticing treats like a new graphical design,
protected memory and pre-emptive multitasking _ fancy words that
mean that when the goofy shareware of the giant eyeball
self-destructs, your entire system won't crash along with it. The
final version of the operating system isn't expected until at least
January 2001.
</P>
<P>
   Even though using a Mac can be a bit more expensive than using a
PC because of the extra software it takes to be fluent in Windows,
I will keep using the Mac until a computer system I like better
comes along. In the meantime, I have my eye on one of those new G4
Cubes. Apple has stuffed a lot of firepower into that little box,
and the design of the thing has entranced me.
</P>
<P>
   And as I mentioned before, I have a small apartment.

GARDENING QUESTIONS AND ANSWERS 
</HEADLINE>
   By DORA GALITZKI    
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Showy Matron
</P>
<P>
   Q. At a nursery, while looking for fall blooming plants to mix
into my garden, I found Sedum Matrona, a purple foliage sedum I
have never seen before. Can you give me any information about it?  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A. Sedum Matrona is a relatively new hybrid between S. telephium
ssp. maximum Atropurpureum and S. spectabile, and it is
spectacular. Both parents are previous winners of the Royal
Horticulture Society's Award of Garden Merit, and Matrona, bred in
1990 in Germany, has been declared Hardy Perennial Plant of the
Year for 2000 in several European countries. It is also popular in
garden centers in the United States, because it combines so well
with other late-blooming perennials and shorter ornamental grasses.
If they are sold out, promise to think about your fall garden a bit
earlier next year. If Sedum Matrona ever becomes Perennial Plant of
the Year in this country, it will sell like a new Harry Potter
book.
</P>
<P>
   Taller than other sedums at 20 to 24 inches, its thick, sturdy,
dark red stems keep it matronly upright and show off the large
heads of delicate pink flowers with darker pink stamens. The
eye-catching contrast between the flowers and the fleshy,
succulent, purple-veined and purple-tinged leaves works much better
in person than it sounds in words.
</P>
<P>
   The umbrella-shaped flowers turn bronzy as the weather gets
colder. Even dry, they retain their garden interest into winter.
Like other sedums, Matrona prefers full sun and average,
well-drained soil and a prominent place to show off. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Columbine Collector
</P>
<P>
   Q. The seed heads on my white columbines have browned. Before
they open and scatter, I would like to gather the seeds. Since the
seeds are ready to go, it seems as if this is the right time to
plant, but I wonder if they can be held until spring?  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A. When the slender seed heads split open, the small, shiny
black seeds are ready. You don't have to stand around waiting for
them because the seed heads are held upright, so the seeds don't
all fall out when the head opens. Instead, the seeds scatter a few
at a time whenever the wind blows. By tipping it into an envelope,
you'll capture nearly all of them.
</P>
<P>
   As to when to plant, your options are limited. Robert
Bartholomei, director of outdoor gardens at the New York Botanical
Garden in the Bronx, said columbine (Aquilegia) requires
stratification, which breaks down the chemical or physical
inhibitors to germination. While many seeds that need
stratification can be kept slightly damp in a refrigerator for a
month or two, columbine seems to need a changing environment,
alternating cooling and warming.
</P>
<P>
   Nature is the best stratifier. Plant them now or later in the
fall; either way, they won't germinate until next spring. Lightly
scratch up the soil, scatter the seeds and just barely cover them.
Have a drink to their health and wait for spring.
</P>
<P>
   Columbines are easy to transplant when they have two to three
sets of leaves, but not when they are mature plants. So if you want
to move them around in the garden, or give a few away, do it while
they're young. Saving columbine seeds to start new plants is a good
idea because the plants tend to be short-lived, dying out after
three or four years.
</P>
<P>
   Will you get that beautiful white columbine back? Most likely.
Normally, they are notorious for cross-pollinating with any other
neighborhood columbines in bloom, and the offspring is
unpredictable. But white columbines are almost guaranteed to be a
cultivar of A. flabellata, which blooms earlier than other
columbines. Pollination without competition is the ideal way to
ensure that seedlings will look like their parents.
</P>

REVIVING A NEGLECTED ART: STENCILING 
</HEADLINE>
  (ART ADV: Photo is being sent to NYT photo clients. Graphic is
being sent to NYT graphic clients. Nonsubscribers can make purchase
one-time rights by calling 888-603-1036 or 888-346-9867.) 
 By EDWARD R. LIPINSKI    
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Stenciling is an old art form. Neanderthal artists created
patterns using their hands as stencils. They blew powdered pigment
across their hands to capture the outline of their fingers on the
walls of caves in Lascaux, France.
</P>
<P>
   Stenciling continued to be used throughout history as a
decorating device to relieve the monotony of plain painted surfaces
on walls, floors, furniture, paper and fabric surfaces.
</P>
<P>
   In Colonial America, stenciling was a popular decorating
technique because other forms of decoration -- paintings and
wallpaper -- were unavailable.
</P>
<P>
   Colonial artists did not have access to the vibrant pigments
readily available in Europe, so they created a softer, mellow
palette from natural dyes obtained from indigenous plants and
minerals.
</P>
<P>
   Stenciling gradually lost favor in homes as printed wallpaper
and mass- produced lithographs became readily available in stores
and mail-order catalogs. Now decorators and homeowners are
rediscovering it as a way to add decorative accents to rooms and
furniture.
</P>
<P>
   The creative do-it-yourselfer will find that it can be a
rewarding hobby as well as a decorating technique.
</P>
<P>
   While stenciling may appear difficult, it is really an easy
craft to learn and does not require any artistic ability or arcane
skills. However, it does require patience in cutting the stencil,
precision in aligning the patterns and care in applying the paint.
Only a few simple and inexpensive tools are required: Stencil
paper, a stencil knife, paint applicators and, sometimes, a chalk
line for aligning the patterns.
</P>
<P>
   Stencil paper has to be durable and paint-resistant. You can buy
ready-made stencil paper, a thick plastic-coated stock, at large
art supply stores or from stencil suppliers. (One supplier is the
Stencil Collector, 1723 Tilghman St., Allentown, Pa. 18104.) You
can also make stencil paper out of manila file folders. Coat the
paper with linseed oil or varnish it to make it paint-resistant.
</P>
<P>
   A craft knife with replaceable blades makes a suitable and
inexpensive stencil-cutting knife. Beware a dull blade; you could
end up tearing the stencil. Besides the cutting knife, you will
need a surface to cut the stencils on. The best is a self-healing
cutting mat (available at art supply stores).
</P>
<P>
   The traditional paint applicator for stencil work is a
stiff-bristled stencil brush. It is important when applying paint
to hold the brush vertically. This will create a stippling effect
and allow you to blend tones together. The vertical posture will
also keep the bristles from creeping under the stencil.
</P>
<P>
   The mistake most beginners make is in loading too much paint on
the bristles. Dip only the tip of the brush in the paint, and
before applying the paint to the stenciled area, do a test on a
piece of scrap paper. Ideally, the paint should dry almost
instantly; if not, there is too much paint on the brush. Wipe off
the excess then try again.
</P>
<P>
   Almost any type of paint can be used for stencil work. First,
check the label on the container to be sure the paint will adhere
to the surface you intend to decorate. Satin finish water-based
paints (available at home centers and paint stores) work well on
most surfaces. Artists' liquid acrylic paints (available in jars at
artist supply stores) are also good for stencil work on walls, but
they do not adhere well to glossy or metal surfaces.
</P>
<P>
   You can also use paint in spray cans, but you must take care to
mask surrounding areas from overspray. Also, spray-painting can
present a safety hazard, so work in a well-ventilated area and wear
a respirator designed for spray work.
</P>
<P>
   At first, you may find it difficult to design your own stencils,
but there are a number of books in the library and from stencil
suppliers that feature a variety of patterns suitable for walls,
floors and furniture. Use a copy machine to reproduce them to an
appropriate size, then mount them onto the stencil paper with
rubber cement. Cut through the copy and the stencil paper to make
your stencil.
</P>
<P>
   While you are applying the paint, you can hold small stencils in
place with your hand or with masking tape, but large stencils are
difficult to keep in position.
</P>
<P>
   A good way keep these pieces immobile as you work is by spraying
the back with a repositionable adhesive. (One brand is 3M-Remount.)
The stencil will be tacky enough to stay in place, but you can
still peel it off the surface to reposition it if necessary. If
possible, use this spray out of doors, because the overspray can
make walls and surrounding surfaces sticky.
</P>
<P>
   Your first stenciling project should be a design on a small flat
surface, like the lid of a chest or a door panel. As you gain
confidence and your skills improve, you can work on a larger area,

`HIGH' SCORES: HONEST TEEN-AGE DOCUMENTARY MAKES THE GRADE ON FOX
</HEADLINE>
  (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
 By KEN PARISH PERKINS 
 C.2000 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   ``American High'' is pretty straightforward: It's about what
happens when a producer and his camera crew shadow a group of high
school students throughout the school year. How ``real'' the
situations are depends on which student is being shot, what they're
dealing with at the moment, and what producer R.J. Cutler thought
would make interesting television, since hundreds of hours have
been whittled down to a precious few.
</P>
<P>
   The series, Wednesdays on Fox, is at least somewhat of a
departure from the current reality TV craze. At least on ``American
High,'' no one is voted out of the school. Nor is the setting
false; it's Highland Park High School in suburban Chicago. The
situations aren't contrived. When Sarah Mages, a junior, talks of
being sad and lonely, it's because she really is.
</P>
<P>
   No one will walk away with a big money prize; the school was
paid, for the most part, in camera equipment donated to the
audio/visual department.
</P>
<P>
   To be sure, ``American High,'' which uses hand-held cameras to
capture the honest, challenging and touching things that go on
during a school year, certainly isn't new on cable and PBS. But it
is new to network television, which has long been leery of trying
anything in documentary form, since there are no scripts and the
filmmakers can't necessarily control what the ``characters'' say or
do. They can't create cliffhangers, for instance.
</P>
<P>
   That's the beauty of ``American High.'' Cutler followed the
students during the 1999-2000 school year, starting with the first
day of the term and going through graduation. (Those who stay with
the program will see an interesting growth through the year.)
</P>
<P>
   Also featured are hundreds of hours of video diaries shot by the
students. This allows an up-close and personal look into the lives
of the teen-agers living in the suburb, which is a largely wealthy
enclave. (Cutler was able to be somewhat economically diverse,
including students who are on the lower end of the area's economic
scale. Race, however, is another matter. Not many black or Hispanic
students are found in Highland Park. At least one student, however,
is black.)
</P>
<P>
   It's a pretty eclectic group. There's Kaytee, a gifted
singer/songwriter whose love songs are often heard in the halls
(most students simply think she's weird). Mike is the football
kicker whose future seems to hinge on a successful season. Anna has
beauty and nearly everything else except a boyfriend. Robby, the
star jock and popular kid, is confronting the uncertain future of
his relationship with his girlfriend, Sarah. (Robby and Sarah have
some of the more touching moments; he's leaving for college and
she's got another year, which means an end-of-the-year breakup.)
Brad, meanwhile, is the first mainstream kid at the high school to
come out of the closet.
</P>
<P>
   Also included is Allie, who is the sad product of her parents'
messy divorce. Suzy is a self-described diva who pursues a career
as an opera singer with singular devotion (but who really just
wants to experience a first kiss). Pablo is a poet whose wild
parties and unruly ways seem destined to undo his future. Tiffany
is a black girl who is having difficulty managing both worlds: a
white world at school and a black one at home.
</P>
<P>
   Then there's Morgan, the most colorful of the students, who is
one of the best reasons to watch. Morgan moves through life with a
``So what?'' attitude, literally scolding his friends for studying
when they ought to know that education means nothing in their lives
at the moment.
</P>
<P>
   Morgan has bad grades and doesn't care. He talks constantly
about having fun and doing whatever strikes him. But he's also a
kid who is dedicated to helping others; his life is complex, like
all our lives.
</P>
<P>
   What makes ``American High'' worth watching is not that it's
``reality TV,'' but that it manages to give a generally honest
glimpse of what's on the minds of teen-agers. Adults in shows like
``Survivor'' are there for the money and fame. Most of the kids are
on ``American High'' just because, as Robby put it during an
interview, ``It's pretty cool.''
</P>
<P>
   For the most part, it is.

IF WOMEN RAN `MONDAY NIGHT FOOTBALL'.....
</HEADLINE>
  (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
 By GAILE ROBINSON 
 c.2000 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Don Ohlmeyer, producer of ABC's ``Monday Night Football,'' hired
comedian Dennis Miller of the preternaturally fluffy hair and
biting tongue to boost the ratings slippage.
</P>
<P>
   Not a bad move, but not a brilliant one. Diversity Don, it's a
whole 'nother sex. Thousands of women who would tune in if the show
were more of a turn-on.
</P>
<P>
   No need to change the game, just give us more about the game
players.
</P>
<P>
   We want some up-close-and-personal moments in between downs.
This shouldn't be hard to do _ ABC invented the five-minute video
sob story for the Lake Placid Olympics.
</P>
<P>
   Here's what we'd like to see.
</P>
<P>
   We'd like to see more skin. The players' uniforms and those of
the team cheerleaders should be of equal fabric yardage. The World
Wrestling Federation knows what we're talking about.
</P>
<P>
   We'd like to be introduced to the player's family. His wife and
children, mother and father. We want to know his people, his
hometown. Show us his picture in the high school yearbook. We're
pretty sure ``America's Most Wanted'' does this.
</P>
<P>
   Is he a good dad? Does he help with the chores? Tell us about
the kid sister he's putting through med school. Tell us about his
volunteer work for his favorite charity, what he does in the
off-season.
</P>
<P>
   Can he cook? Not just barbecue, but really operate a range? What
are his favorite recipes? We want a brief tour of his kitchen and
then a quick, Martha moment of food preparation; think Kraft Music
Hall and its multiminute recipe commercials.
</P>
<P>
   If he's a rookie, he's spent a lot of money on a new custom
wardrobe. Let's see it; have hin spin around a few times. Love that
jacket. Hire James Brown away from Fox to perform the Elsa Klensch
duties. He always looks fabulous, and those shoulder pads! Whose
are bigger, Brown's or Ronnie Lott's?
</P>
<P>
   Don, baby, (Dennis likes to say ``baby'' a lot) we're offering
you these suggestions completely free of charge in the hope you
will see their commercial value. And, Don, just imagine the new
advertisers you could get: feminine hygiene products, yogurt,
vitamins, soaps, detergents and shampoos. Cha-ching. &QL;

WEB SURFING, AT THE SOUND OF YOUR OWN VOICE 
</HEADLINE>
   By CATHERINE GREENMAN    
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   As manufacturers of wireless phones, handheld computers and
other Internet gadgets scramble to make Web information accessible
without the need to boot up a computer, some companies have a
different plan. They are adapting the Web to the one device that
virtually everyone has: The telephone.
</P>
<P>
   And they don't mean one of those Web phones that connect you to
e-mail and stock quotes after you set up a special wireless-service
account and scroll through a series of menus and buttons. All you
need is a telephone, even an old-fashioned rotary dial phone. These
voice portals _ like Tellme, BeVocal and Quack.com _ let you pick
up a phone and let your voice do the surfing. Actually, it's more
like wading, but you can reach some parts of the Web.
</P>
<P>
   ``The broad view is that we'll eventually offer everything you
can get on the Web over the phone,'' said Alex Quilici, chief
executive of Quack.com, which began offering its services in April
and currently provides, among other things, weather, traffic, movie
and restaurant information for most areas of the country. ``You'll
see it moving to e-commerce, e-mail and instant messaging.''
Quilici said the company had reached an agreement with Lycos, a
popular search engine, to begin providing voice-activated features
to many of its e-commerce partner sites.
</P>
<P>
   The voice portal is part of the thickening haze blurring the
distinctions among computers, cell phones, handheld organizers and
the various hybrids on the market. But just as wireless Web devices
can retrieve only limited information from the Web, the voice
portals, in most cases, have limited their phone menus so
information can be found easily, either directly from the Web or
from a server-like program.
</P>
<P>
   Most voice portals use speech recognition technology and a
computer language that digitizes the spoken word and searches
Internet servers based on the commands. In most cases, these
services are organized much like basic Internet portals.
</P>
<P>
   Dial Tellme, for example, and a female voice asks you to select
a category like weather, stock quotes, sports, traffic, horoscopes
and airlines. Callers can select nearby restaurants according to
their Tellme ratings (Tellme automatically determines where the
call is coming from) and connect directly to the restaurants.
Catchy tunes and R2D2-like computing noises play in the background
while the information is fetched. (At Quack.com, a sound like the
flip-flop of duck feet _ more subtle than an outright quack _ fades
in and out.) The information retrieved is read to the caller by a
recorded or digitized voice.
</P>
<P>
   Many of the voice portals let users customize their calling
menus. A Tellme user, for example, can enter stock ticker symbols
onto a list, which is stored on the Tellme site. When the user
dials the toll-free Tellme number and says, ``Stock quotes,'' the
service will read the current price quotations for the stocks on
the list.
</P>
<P>
   The information that goes back to the caller is not limited by
the constraints of the small screen found on wireless phones with
Web access, say those involved in the voice portal market. ``The
possibilities are far-reaching,'' said Adam Greenhalgh, president
of Speaklink, a voice portal that will start operating later this
summer. ``A voice portal is the same as an Internet portal, but you
have the functionality of talking to it. Speech connectivity is the
next evolution of the Internet.''
</P>
<P>
   Voice portal companies are aiming at computer users who need
information but who are away from their computers, and they are
also going after the ever-increasing market of cell-phone users.
All voice portal services are accessible via cell phones.
</P>
<P>
   The Kelsey Group, a market research firm in Princeton, N.J.,
predicts that the voice portal market will generate $12 billion by
2005 through advertising revenue, e-commerce transactions and
related hardware and telephone-service-carrier costs.
</P>
<P>
   But while analysts agree that advanced speech recognition
capabilities and Web development tools are bridging the gap between
the phone and the Internet, many wonder about how many people will
use these services.
</P>
<P>
   ``Voice will never be the dominant interface because it's so
information-poor,'' said John Dalton, an analyst at Forrester
Research in Cambridge, Mass. ``When you compare a stand-alone voice
interface, you're limited to the amount of information you can
distribute. People have a lot more choices, and they can retain a
lot more when they're looking at information on a PC.''
</P>
<P>
   The phone services will not work as effectively as the Internet
for research or making buying decisions, Dalton said, because the
average consumer does not remember more than a few bits of audio
information at a time and needs to be able to see and compare items
before buying.
</P>
<P>
   Voice portals are competing with some audio services that
already have brand recognition. Analysts say the voice portals may
find it hard to win over people who would otherwise call MovieFone
for movie listings or consult another trusted source for restaurant
reviews. What is more, the voice portals cannot provide everything
that a service like MovieFone can. You cannot buy movie tickets at
a voice portal, for example. You can only hear what's playing,
where and at what times.
</P>
<P>
   Quilici, at Quack.com, said he considered the service to be more
of an extension of the Web and other information sources, but one
that was easily accessible from anywhere. ``Rather than staying
late at work figuring out movie and dinner plans, you'll be able to
do it on the way home from your phone,'' he said. Quilici added
that Quack.com planned to forge agreements with wireless
manufacturers that would allow a consumer to call the service with
a request and have any lengthy information sent as a text message
to a wireless phone, instead of hearing it recited back.
</P>
<P>
   One Tellme user, Louise Valente of Palo Alto, Calif., said the
service was useful. ``I find that it's handy and frees up my time
by not having to go and power up my computer to access
information,'' she said. ``I don't know that it's absolutely
necessary, but it's a convenience.''
</P>
<P>
   Most of the voice portals expect to earn money down the road by
setting up partnerships with shopping sites and by charging
commissions on e-commerce transactions.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Currently, the phone services are supported by advertising. Each
time an option is selected at Tellme or Quack.com, whether it is a
request for movie listings or restaurants, callers hear a ``brought
to you by'' message reminiscent of early radio shows. While the
service is looking up a request, callers might hear another 10- or
15-second message from a sponsor.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can ignore banner ads on the Web, but you can't ignore the
voice,'' said Greenhalgh, at Speaklink. ``We don't want to
frustrate the users.''
</P>
<P>
   Some voice portals like Tellme and HeyAnita, which plans to
start operating in the fall, are focusing on communications
services. In its Phone Booth section, for example, Tellme offers
new users a free, two-minute long-distance call. Before the call is
put through, the user will hear a 10- or 15-second advertisement.
Yellow and White Pages listings will also be free.
</P>
<P>
   ``The whole telecommunications industry is in the process of
changing, and it gives us a great set of opportunities to go
after,'' said Mike McCue, chief executive of Tellme. He also said
Tellme had received financing from AT&AMP;T and would work on the AT&AMP;T
network to let callers connect directly to any service they
selected while on Tellme.
</P>
<P>
   Sanjeev Kuwadekar, chief executive of HeyAnita, said the company
was partnering with several large Internet service providers to
allow consumers with e-mail accounts at the ISP's to send and
receive e-mail with voice commands. HeyAnita also has a page on its
Web site that lets users store contact information for people they
call regularly. When such a user calls the service, says a personal
identification number and speaks an individual's name, HeyAnita
will read back the phone number or e-mail address. The same can be
done with to-do lists and calendar information entered on the
HeyAnita site.
</P>
<P>
   Others, like BeVocal, which opened in June, are focusing on
information geared to mobile callers, like driving directions and
traffic reports. Through a partnership with Mapquest.com, BeVocal
provides callers with driving directions within major metropolitan
areas. That part of the service is available only in California,
Texas and Michigan at present, but the company says the coverage
will be nationwide by September.
</P>
<P>
   Amol Joshi, founder and vice president of marketing at BeVocal,
said the company planned partnerships with wireless phone carriers
to provide them with voice-activated dialers and a direct voice
link to BeVocal. Wireless phone customers would be able to select
that as an optional feature of their monthly calling plans. In
addition, BeVocal's strategy is to share commissions with wireless
carriers for any business transactions, like hotel reservations or
airline ticket purchases, that take place during a call.
Commissions would be paid by the business, not the consumer, he
said.
</P>
<P>
   Voice portals are also working with Web designers to broaden the
content the portals can provide. Tellme, for example, is licensing
its technology to Web site developers and allowing them to make
their sites accessible to Tellme's voice service. ``We'll get to
the point where anybody can build a customized phone application,''
McCue said.
</P>
<P>
   A completely different approach to Web access via telephone is
simply to call other people who will surf and search for you. A
company called iNetNow employs actual human beings to retrieve Web
information for the people who call the service. The service is
free for a promotion period that ends in the fall. After that,
iNetNow will offer monthly plans of $4.95 for five calls and $21.95
for unlimited use.
</P>
<P>
   The company provides service around the clock; it has 50
operators who work eight-hour shifts. Complicated questions are
handled by a research department that culls data and links from the
Web and puts them into information packets that can be sent to the
callers via e-mail or faxes.
</P>
<P>
   ``The voice portal companies are all kind of jockeying to figure
out what people want most and deliver that,'' said Lenny Young,
president of iNetNow. ``We're trying to be much broader. It
requires more people, but we think it's the most satisfying way to
get the information.'' Young said the company planned to add voice
recognition features in the future to cut down on overhead costs.
</P>
<P>
   Harry Kelso, an environmental consultant in Richmond, Va., used
iNetNow to look up articles about the military's role in the
westward expansion of the United States, and he was impressed by
the results. ``I thought this was a pretty big request to ask of
anyone,'' he said, ``but they came back with things I wouldn't have
dreamt would be around. If it means that you can speed up finding
facts, then that goes a really long way toward helping.''

ANYONE CAN WRITE A LYRIC WITH THESE WEBSITES 
</HEADLINE>
   By   EDWARD BOLAND Jr.   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Musical lyrics, perhaps more than most art forms, range from the
inspiring to the inane. With an eye on the latter, lyric generators
have turned up on the Web, supplying characteristic lyrics for
songs in the musical genre of your choice.
</P>
<P>
   Choosing from country music generators that know the long road
from ``flirt'' to ``hurt'' or Goth-inspired generators that will
search for that perfect rhyme for ``pierced skin'' (``fierce
kin''?), phonetically challenged songsmiths and Web surfers looking
for distraction can now pick up the mouse and sit back as the
poetry springs forth from the computer screen.
</P>
<P>
   For the most part there are two types of lyric generators. One
creates new lyrics typical of a particular artist or genre each
time you click on the generator button. The other asks you to fill
in various words, which are then used in the lyrics of your new
song.
</P>
<P>
   While it may be more entertaining to use your own material, some
automatic lyric generators have captured the spirit of the original
artists. Those who want to mimic lyrical works in the tradition of
boy bands like 'N Sync and the Backstreet Boys should seek out the
Cheesy Song generator
(smople.thehub.com.au/cathyst/c(underscore)songs1.html). It raises
the question, though, of whether a soulless Web site can produce
lyrics on par with the pop poetry that these bands produce.
</P>
<P>
   Chances are, if you take four cute boys, put them in silver
pants and have them croon generated lyrics like ``Babe you know I
need you more/Than I've needed anything before/I'll walk beside you
in the rain/Kiss me once again,'' there won't be a dry eye in the
house.
</P>
<P>
   If you want a musical career that lasts longer than raw seafood
on a hot sidewalk, you might want to skip boy-band lyrics and take
a look at two Web sites that generate country music lyrics:
www.binary.net/dturley/js/song/song.html and
www.outofservice.com/country. The sites seem to use the same lyric
generator because the words and phrasing are uncannily similar.
</P>
<P>
   The lyrics focus on the timeless country music theme of love
lost and are usually no less poignant than those of some of today's
biggest country music stars. You can almost hear Alan Jackson
singing ``Well. . . . She asked me if I'd swear off booze
forever/She said our love would never die/But who'da thought she'd
get drunk with Marv Albert/She sealed me in the vault and smirked
goodbye.''
</P>
<P>
   In the tradition of Nine Inch Nails and Marilyn Manson, the Goth
lyric generator will let you connect with
gloom-doom-I'll-be-in-my-room teen-agers. While it might not
provide the eloquent, subdued social commentary of such Manson
classics as ``Dried Up, Tied and Dead to the World,'' the Goth
lyric generator (scribble.com/dghq/gothlyric) will provide you with
dour nuggets like ``Evil curses yearning manacles/Rats suck
nocturnal rapture/Foolish mortals destroy lonely needles/Serpents
collapse from infernal psychosis.'' Most of the lyrics created by
this generator look as though they could have come right off the
back of a math notebook belonging to a high school student snubbed
at prom time.
</P>
<P>
   Those looking for a bit more artistic control should try lyric
generators that require more participation from the user. At the
Write a Spice Girls Hit site (www.amused.com /aom/stop.html), for
example, you provide 15 words, each limited to specific syllable
counts. In the end, you'll have your very own sugary pop hit with
lyrics like ``Hey, you always on the run/Gotta slow it down, baby,
gotta have some fun/Do Do Do Do always be together/Ba da Ba Ba
(sung three times) stay that way forever.'
</P>
<P>
   One of the most popular lyric generators on the Web is the
Alanis Morissette lyric generator. It was created by David Neilson,
a company manager from Los Angeles who maintains a humor Web site.
The idea came to him while he was listening to his newly purchased
Morissette CD. ``I was listening to the album and I noticed that
all the songs were pretty similar,'' he recalled, ``no rhyme, no
meter, and I thought to myself, `Hey, I can do this.''' Thanks to
Neilson, now millions of other people can do it as well, at
www.brunching.com/toys /toy-alanislyrics.html)
</P>
<P>
   By filling in 10 fields, including a word for something you hate
and the name of an ex-boyfriend or ex-girlfriend, you can generate
three songs: ``Will to Live,'' ``I Think'' and ``Why.'' ``Will to
Live'' deals with an unpleasant relationship that has scarred you
for life. ``I Think'' also deals with an unpleasant relationship
that has scarred you for life, and ``Why'' deals with. ... Well,
you may already be familiar with Morissette's oeuvre.
</P>
<P>
   To get a sense of how the lyric generator might handle
Morissette's emotional terrain, I entered the name of an ex
(Nicole) and something that an overwrought adolescent might hate
(corporate pigs).
</P>
<P>
   From that outline, the generator produced this angst-ridden
testimonial: ``Is it because of corporate pigs I feel this way/Or
am I lost in a tale of Yeats, adrift far from home/Nicole broke my
will to live/Nicole broke my will to live/I was getting better but
then/Nicole broke my will to live.''
</P>
<P>
   Now if I could only learn to play the guitar.

 ART ADVISORY: WITH A GRAPHIC SUMMARIZING RESUMES OF FATHER-SON
BUSHES 
 By MILES BENSON  
 c.2000 Newhouse News Service  
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHILADELPHIA _ As a potential president, George W. Bush's
credentials look strong -- until you compare them to his father's.
</P>
<P>
   When the senior Bush was elected president in 1988, at age 64,
he had already served eight years as vice president under Ronald
Reagan. Before that, Bush had been CIA director, ambassador to
China, U.N. ambassador, Republican National Committee chairman, a
member of Congress, a successful businessman and a Navy combat
pilot.
</P>
<P>
   His son, George W. Bush, 54, now in his sixth year as governor
of Texas, has never held any other public office.
</P>
<P>
   Though former President Bush does not generate the kind of
excitement, enthusiasm and veneration among converntion Republicans
of, say, a Ronald Reagan, party leaders have always argued that he
was uniquely qualified by experience to be president.
</P>
<P>
   The new Bush GOP presidential nominee has different strengths.
</P>
<P>
   House Speaker J. Dennis Hastert, R-Ill., said he is well
satisfied with the younger Bush's qualifications, even if they are
not his dad's.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's been governor of one of the largest states in the union
and he's been very successful at that,'' Hastert said. ``He's been
in the political arena his whole life.''
</P>
<P>
   Asked to compare the resumes of the two Bushes. Hastert said,
``It's all relative. I just think he (George W.) brings different
qualities. His father was never the governor of a state and had to
make those decisions and pass legislation and do all the things
that a governor has to do.''
</P>
<P>
   Other Republicans acknowledge a big difference in experience
between the two Bushes, but do not necessarily regard that as a
problem.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nobody looks as good as Bush senior when you're comparing
resumes,'' said Rep. Tom Davis, R-Va. ``But a lot of Bush senior's
resume was in foreign policy, which didn't help him much in 1992,''
when voters denied him a second term and elected Democrat Bill
Clinton, Davis recalled.
</P>
<P>
   ``With Cheney on the ticket, that neutralizes any concern about
experience,'' Davis said.
</P>
<P>
   Davis was referring to Dick Cheney, Bush's choice for vice
president, a former defense secretary, White House chief of staff
and former member of Congress, seen by some as training wheels on
Bush's bicycle.
</P>
<P>
   ``He conveys the image of a steady hand to help guide the
country,'' said independent pollster John Zogby.
</P>
<P>
   Gov. John Engler, R-Mich., said the younger Bush's level of
experience to be president is ``comparable'' to Ronald Reagan, who
had served for eight years as governor of California.
</P>
<P>
   Governing a big state, making executive decisions, dealing with
budgets and legislatures, is good preparation for a future
president, in Engler's view.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now, you're not negotiating nuclear arms treaties, or trying
to broker peace among warring nations, and I'm not going to suggest
that being commander-in-chief of the Michigan national guard is
quite the same as being commander-in-chief of the United States,
but there are at least some experiences that have some
application,'' Engler said.
</P>
<P>
   Most governors are qualified to be president, claims Jim
Gilmore, Virginia's Republican chief executive. ``governors are in
the executive branch and therefore they are used to the exercise of
power and authority,'' Gilmore said.
</P>
<P>
   The qualifications required for presidents under the U.S.
Constitution are quite simple. Any natural-born citizen over the
age of 35, who has lived in the United States for 14 of those
years, is eligible.
</P>
<P>
   Zealous partisans brush aside the issue of the new presidential
candidate Bush's level of experience.
</P>
<P>
   ``Eisenhower was just a soldier. He didn't know diddly-squat
about welfare reform,'' said Laura Donahue, a GOP convention
delegate from Quincy, Ill., recalling President Dwight D.
Eisenhower, who served two White House terms, from 1952 to 1960.
``I just want somebody who will have honor and integrity and will
do what is good for the country.''
</P>
<P>
   Jacqueline Skurla, of Chudds Ford, Pa., the mother of three,
calls herself ``a supermarket Republican,'' who browses among
issues like a shopper buying groceries, likes the younger Bush but
does not think his record matches his father's.
</P>
<P>
   ``Compare resumes?'' she laughed. ``Forget it. Hang up.''
</P>
<P>
   Independent experts acknowledge that the senior Bush's
qualifications list is more extensive than the son's, but question
whether it matters much.
</P>
<P>
   ``His father had enormous foreign policy experience, but very
little domestic political experience. He did not have the feel for
politics and, as a result, he made all kinds of mistakes,'' said
Karl Von Vorys, a political science professor at the University of
Pennsylvania.
</P>
<P>
   ``George W. Bush is quite the opposite,'' Von Vorys said. ``He
does not have all the credentials of his father. They are mostly
domestic and mostly political, negotiating and building coalitions.
That's what the younger Bush does well.''
</P>
<P>
   John Aldrich, a political scientist at Duke University, notes
that many of the senior Bush's important positions were appointive
posts, before he became president, while his son has twice won
election to a very important state-wide office.
</P>
<P>
   In the end, the qualifications voters must compare are not Bush
vs. Bush, but Bush vs. Al Gore, the man he is running against, vice
president for the last eight years, who served in both the Senate
and House of Representatives.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's no question if you're simply talking about resumes, Al
Gore has a tremendous resume,'' said Vin Weber, a former Republican
congressman from Minnesota, and political adviser to Sen. John
McCain. ``I wouldn't begin to argue that Gore, whom I served with
and like as a person, is anything other than fully qualified to be
president of the United States.''
</P>
<P>
   But so is George W. Bush, ``who has risen to political
leadership in a big state, acquitted himself well, and assembled a
national campaign, which is not an absolute qualification for the
presidency,'' Weber said,''but if you can't assemble a national
campaign it's hard to say you could govern the country
successfully.''
</P>
<P>
   \roMDBO\ &UR; -(OPTIONAL TRIM FOLLOWS)\roMDNM\ &UR; -
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, many Repuiblicans argue that their 2000 presidential
candidate is better qualified by sheer governing experience than
was President Bill Clinton when he was elected after serving as
governor of the much smaller state of Arkansas.
</P>
<P>
   Still, late-night comedians continue to ridicule George W.
Bush's intellectual fire power.
</P>
<P>
   The nominee will have a chance to dispel any doubts about his
capacity to be president when he delivers his acceptance speech to
the convention Thursday night.
</P>
<P>
   Pollster Zogby said Bush does not need to be brilliant in his
appearance before a national TV audience.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's already won the affability war,'' Zogby said., ``People
tend to like him. Basically, he just has to read his speech and
stay standing up.''

ONLINE SHOPPING: BLEMISHED GOODS FOR BARGAIN HUNTERS 
</HEADLINE>
   By MICHELLE SLATALLA   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   It was common knowledge in the 1970s that my mother-in-law
trafficked in broken Godiva chocolates that she bought in unmarked
plastic bags at insanely low prices from an outlet store near her
home in Reading, Pa.
</P>
<P>
   She was the one to see if you wanted chipped dark chocolate
leaves, imperfect toffees or cracked pralines.
</P>
<P>
   Living at the epicenter of the outlet store revolution that
created a national obsession with blemished merchandise, she was
also known to lug home bags full of misshapen pretzels, sets of
dishes with the glaze marred by air bubbles and Izod shirts whose
alligators were missing part of a snout.
</P>
<P>
   But things went sour over the years as the nature of outlet
stores changed. These days you will not find much blemished
merchandise.
</P>
<P>
   (When I phoned Godiva's outlet store in Reading, the clerk who
answered said, ``Oh, no, Godiva does not sell anything
imperfect.'')
</P>
<P>
   Nor will you find my mother-in-law working the aisles in vain
pursuit of partial snouts.
</P>
<P>
   ``Outlets sort of killed themselves, because a lot of
manufacturers started to produce a separate lower budget line for
the outlets, and suddenly it wasn't so cheap anymore,'' said
professor Christina Lindholm, chairwoman of fashion design and
merchandising at Virginia Commonwealth University.
</P>
<P>
   ``I haven't seen a genuine outlet in a long time selling stuff
that once had been full price, then got marked down, then became
truly a bargain,'' Lindholm said.
</P>
<P>
   Don't bother boarding a bus for a day trip. These days, the best
place to shop for old-fashioned, outlet-quality blemished bargains
is online, where a growing number of retailers are offering seconds
along with factory close-outs and severely marked-down examples of
first-quality items that failed to sell in a store.
</P>
<P>
   From panty hose with an imperfect seam at Onehanesplace.com to
baseball bats with a smudged label at Hq4sports.com to computer
monitors with a scratch on the case at Surplus-pc.com, you can find
examples of almost any category of (legal) merchandise simply by
typing ``blemished'' into a search-engine's query box.
</P>
<P>
   And according to online retailers who sell first-quality
merchandise along with blemished products, there is a growing
appetite among online shoppers for the slightly imperfect stuff if
it is offered at bargain prices.
</P>
<P>
   ``We actually do more business on our seconds page than on our
regular site,'' said Steven Kundrat, who sells ethnic musical
instruments online at Mid-east.com.
</P>
<P>
   About 75 percent of the site's retail sales are of blemished
instruments, like the sitar with ``finish blemishes,'' priced at
$400 plus shipping (compared with $640 for one listed in perfect
condition).
</P>
<P>
   To anyone who lived through the golden age of outlets, the
popularity of blemished merchandise online should come as no
surprise. But there is an underlying reason for the enduring
allure.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're a country of great excess, in all things,'' Lindholm
said, ``and the American shopper is very much into quantity and
bargains and good deals.''
</P>
<P>
   But she added that ``many people will not spend very much on any
one thing, but overall will end up spending more money than if they
had just bought a single good-quality item that they needed.''
</P>
<P>
   That raises a philosophical question that has been nagging at me
since a certain weekend jaunt to Reading in the mid-1980s: Which is
better to own, a chipped example of an enormous blue enamel baking
dish that you don't need or a mint version of one you actually
wanted?
</P>
<P>
   ``A bargain is only a bargain if you need it and can use it,''
Lindholm said (nearly 15 years too late to help me, I might add).
</P>
<P>
   So if you troll for blemished merchandise online, you should
bear a few things in mind:
</P>
<P>
   _ Make sure you really need that extra pair of shoes from
Classicpumps.com or that book with a scuffed cover from
Bookzone.com or that dented wine rack from Wineracks-unlimited.com.
</P>
<P>
   _ Be fussy as you home in on your quarry. ``If you're going
through a bin,'' said Carol Davis, spokeswoman for
Onehanesplace.com, ``you can pick the thing up and say, `Do I
really want to live with this color?' But online you don't have
that luxury.''
</P>
<P>
   For that reason, many online retailers will pick through the
blemished items for you. ``We don't sell any marginal stuff because
of that,'' said Keith Richardson, owner of Sierratradingpost.com,
``and generally the response from customers once they get it is
that they can't even find the flaw.'' The company sells both
blemished and first-quality name-brand clothing at discounts that
typically range from 35 percent to 70 percent off retail.
</P>
<P>
   The company cuts out the labels from imperfect items from
manufacturers like L.L. Bean. ``They're very picky about what
merchandise is out there with their name on it,'' Richardson said.
</P>
<P>
   _ Buy only from sites that clearly describe the imperfection.
Sierratradingpost.com, for example, clearly explains the difference
between items described as overstocks and close-outs (``always
first quality'') and seconds (``cosmetic blemishes/irregular'').
</P>
<P>
   _ Before you buy, make sure the site posts a clear return
policy. And don't be afraid to ask questions, either by phone or
e-mail, before you purchase.
</P>
<P>
   ``I want people to be sure they know what they're buying, so I
don't have a shopping basket on the site,'' said Kundrat of
Mid-eastcom. ``We like to talk to the customer on the phone before
they place the order.''
</P>
<P>
   I certainly learned my lesson with the enamel baking dish. I
won't buy any more imperfect merchandise unless it serves a
genuinely useful, practical purpose.
</P>
<P>
   And as for my mother-in-law, she went retail.
</P>
<P>
   Note to Godiva.com: We would both reconsider if you would.  &QL;

   ``Two Views of Hell'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   By Edward Fudge and Robert Peterson &QL;
</P>
<P>
   (InterVarsity Press, $12.99) &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Edward Fudge and Robert Peterson agree that there is a hell, and
that you certainly don't want to go there. But on this subject,
that constitutes most of the common ground.
</P>
<P>
   ``Two Views of Hell'' presents an evangelical debate on the fate
of the unrighteous: traditionalism (perpetual torment) vs.
conditionalism (eventual annihilation). Peterson, a St. Louis
seminary professor, stands on the former view; Fudge, a Houston
theologian and lawyer, makes the case for the latter. Both work to
build an argument based on Scripture.
</P>
<P>
   The conflict boils down to the concepts of ``death'' and
``everlasting destruction.'' Fudge sees both as essentially
extinction of existence. Peterson understands death as separation _
of the body from the soul (the end of earthly life) and of a person
from God (damnation, or the ``second death'').
</P>
<P>
   The dispute is sometimes sharp, although both authors subscribe
to a goal of courtesy in the debate. Peterson seems to get the best
of the battle, but Fudge may succeed in making readers think
twice. &QL;

   ``Virtual Tibet, Searching for Shangri-La From the Himalayas to
Hollywood'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   By Orville Schell &QL;
</P>
<P>
   (Metropolitan Books, $26) &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Tibet has always enchanted the Western mind. The accounts of a
handful of intrepid explorers have provided fodder for Hollywood's
creations of Shangri-La. And, no doubt, the frequent visits by the
Dalai Lama and other Tibetan teachers have had something to do with
the growing numbers of Americans turning to Tibetan Buddhism.
</P>
<P>
   Megabuck films, such as ``Seven Years in Tibet'' and ``Kundun,''
have fed us with lavish portrayals of Tibet's ancient splendor and
timeless mysteries. Movie stars such as Richard Gere have been been
influenced by Buddhism and have helped the Tibetan cause.
</P>
<P>
   ``Virtual Tibet'' is a thoroughly absorbing examination of the
bizarre grip this little country exercises on the Western
imagination. It is written by one of the foremost China/Tibet
watchers of our times, Orville Schell, who has given us a book that
is entertaining and informative.
</P>
<P>
   Schell, who has visited and written about Tibet several times
since the 1980s, says that his captivation began at age 13, when he
read Heinrich Harrer's memoirs of the seven years he spent there as
the tutor of the child Dalai Lama.
</P>
<P>
   He traveled to Austria to interview Harrer in his later years.
Heinrich Harrer, it turns out, had a Nazi past. There are
fascinating portraits of various other personalities who have
helped to ignite the dreamlike image Americans have of Tibet,
including glimpses of His Holiness the 14th Dalai Lama, whose
earthy wisdom flies in the face of Beverly Hills'
pseudo-spirituality.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike many of the Hollywood groupies described in Schell's
insightful and lively book, readers are left with a clearer idea
about Tibetan fantasies and realities. &QL;

 &HT;    DEMOCRAT'S WIDOW WILL INTRODUCE BUSHBy KEN HERMAN
 &HT;    c.2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHILADELPHIA _ One goes out of his way to get along with people.
The other seemed to craft a successful career by figuring out how
not to get along with people.
</P>
<P>
   But somehow George W. Bush, the gregarious one, and Bob Bullock,
who thrived on closed-door confrontation, became fast friends.
</P>
<P>
   Thursday night, in the kind of bipartisan symbol coveted by the
Bush presidential campaign and more poignant to Texans that the
rest of the country will know, Jan Bullock, the widow of Democratic
Lt. Gov. Bullock, will introduce Bush as he accepts the GOP
presidential nomination.
</P>
<P>
   It's a major step along a path predicted on June 20, 1996, by
Bullock.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think he will be (president),'' he said that day, a propos
of nothing, as he joined Bush in the Senate chamber for the
swearing-in of state Sen. John Carona of Dallas. ``There's no other
governor in the country today that has the rapport with the
Legislature and with the people that I find George Bush has. He's
an extremely nice person and he's all Texan.''
</P>
<P>
   Two days short of three years later, Bullock died of congestive
heart failure and lung cancer as the Bush campaign took off, and
the Bullock prediction began to look prophetic.
</P>
<P>
   ``Getting Governor Bush elected is unfinished business for
Bob,'' Jan Bullock said of her late husband, a crusty, insistent
man who didn't much care for unfinished business.
</P>
<P>
   She married Bob Bullock (20 years her senior and previously
married four times) at Austin's Green Pastures Restaurant in 1985.
She is an Austin native and University of Texas graduate. In
addition to her career as an interior designer and Realtor, Mrs.
Bullock has served on the Texas Historical Commission and been
active in projects of the State Preservation Board and Daughters of
the American Revolution.
</P>
<P>
   Thursday night's speech is not Mrs. Bullock's first appearance
on the Bush presidential campaign trail. Back in March, when Bush
clinched the nomination, she was on the stage as he spoke to the
nation from his victory rally at the Dell Jewish Community Campus
in Northwest Austin.
</P>
<P>
   For the GOP, getting Bullock to speak is a coup for a party
eager to change its image and attract independent and Democratic
votes. Along the campaign trail, Bush frequently offers Bullock as
an example of his ability to cross party lines to get things done.
</P>
<P>
   For more than 40 years, including stints as secretary of state,
comptroller and lieutenant governor, Bullock was a force in the
Democratic Party, the only political show in town for most of his
life. Bush moved quickly after winning election in 1994 to find a
way to work with Bullock, who, as lieutenant governor, controlled
the flow of legislation in the Senate.
</P>
<P>
   And through his decades in state government, Bullock had
developed a network of well-placed people positioned to kill
anything Bullock wanted dead. Bush quickly got the lay of the land
and visited Bullock at the lieutenant governor's home.
</P>
<P>
   To the consternation of many Texas Democrats, the Bush-Bullock
ties grew, both personally and politically. In 1998, Bullock
endorsed Bush for re-election over Democrat Garry Mauro, a longtime
Bullock friend and ally.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wish my old friend Lieutenant Governor Bob Bullock was here
to describe what it was like working with a newly-minted Republican
governor, because I can tell you what it was like working with a
tough old Democratic lieutenant governor,'' Bush told supporters
from around the nation in Austin last month. ``I learned a lot, but
both of us decided to put aside our partisan differences and work
for what was best for Texas.''
</P>
<P>
   At Bullock's request, Bush offered the eulogy at his friend's
funeral.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was fearless, occasionally outrageous _ a neon personality
in a world of gray,'' Bush said of Bullock, who had survived
alcoholism, illness and four divorces.
</P>
<P>
   In his autobiography ``A Charge to Keep,'' published to coincide
with the presidential race, Bush recounted his final meeting with
Bullock.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the end, we wept together,'' Bush wrote. ``He was so proud,
so eager, so convinced that I had a great chance to be the next
president. He had told friends that he looked forward to watching
me take the oath of office. Bullock, a man who had lived for years
on his sheer strength of will, realized that if it happened he
would not be there to see it. If it happens, he will have been a
huge part of making it so.''

<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON -- Millions of stunned Americans got their first look
at the human devastation inside the Nazi death camps from newsreels
screened in their local movie theaters after the Allied invasion of
Germany.
</P>
<P>
   So that the atrocities could never be denied, Gen. Dwight D.
Eisenhower, the European Allied commander, insisted that military
cameramen document them in that spring of 1945.
</P>
<P>
   Americans know those haunting images so well that a single frame
of skeletal Jewish survivors is now cinematic shorthand for the
Holocaust. It is why Steven Spielberg could film his 1993
``Schindler's List'' in black and white, evoking the wartime
newsreels.
</P>
<P>
   Film defines our public memory of the Holocaust, and it is how
most of us initially encounter its horrors, whether through the
historical footage or the documentary and dramatic films that
footage has influenced. In fact, the word Holocaust -- a biblical
term for ``a burnt offering to God'' -- did not come into general
use until the airing of the 1978 television miniseries of the same
name.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps this familiarity explains a commonly held belief that
the images speak for themselves. But do they?
</P>
<P>
   The conclusion of a panel of international scholars, simply put,
is no.
</P>
<P>
   They convened for two weeks at the U.S. Holocaust Memorial
Museum in late July, drawn by a shared belief that these images
would tell a story not only about the Holocaust, but of our
relationship to it.
</P>
<P>
   ``Context is everything in Holocaust history, no matter the
medium,'' said Raye Farr, director of the museum's film and video
collections.
</P>
<P>
   The Nazis and European Jews intuitively understood the power of
images, and deliberately created visual records of the events that
consumed them more than 50 years ago. Yet few scholars have given
critical thought to the original footage or to the films that
followed.
</P>
<P>
   The slaughter of 6 million Jews -- two-thirds of Europe's Jewish
population -- is paramount to us today. But as the war in Europe
ended, their deaths were not singled out. It wasn't until the
mid-1970s that the Holocaust assumed cultural prominence. Survivors
began to speak publicly, and movies and museums followed. Along the
way, ambiguities receded behind moral absolutes.
</P>
<P>
   Film, to a great degree, influenced those developments. But only
a handful of scholars have wondered why or how.
</P>
<P>
   Jeffrey Shandler, who has written about television's portrayal
of the Holocaust, chronicled how the footage came to be regarded as
privileged and unimpeachable. The film bore witness to heinous
crimes and so, as Shandler explained, ``It does not invite
questioning.''
</P>
<P>
   But Thomas Doherty of Brandeis University's Film Studies Program
believes that deference is misplaced.
</P>
<P>
   ``Your respect for the event has to include a demand for
historical integrity,'' Doherty said.
</P>
<P>
   The need for vigilance is underscored by a still photograph that
very nearly made its way into the Holocaust Museum. It was
purported to be an image of actual events, but was discovered to be
from a postwar movie about the concentration camps.
</P>
<P>
   A 1992 public television documentary about black American
soldiers as camp liberators is another argument for scrutiny. The
film relied heavily on personal recollections. But survivor
testimony and the documentation do not always match, leading
scholars to suggest that some survivors confused historical footage
seen over the years with their personal memories -- a reminder of
just how deeply those newsreels have seeped into the public
consciousness.
</P>
<P>
   Images, especially in the computer era, are malleable. If they
are manipulated and misused, historical accuracy degrades and opens
the door to the denial that Eisenhower feared.
</P>
<P>
   Asking questions about the images is a way to ensure their
integrity, but the central truth of the Holocaust provides the
framework.
</P>
<P>
   ``When it comes to the Holocaust, although interpretation of
information may differ, the facts are indisputable,'' said
Alexander B. Rossino of the museum's Center for Advanced Holocaust
Studies, which brought the scholars together. ``It happened in a
certain way, it happened to certain people, and the killing
procedures were carried out with certain methods.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's very important that we maintain a firm grasp of the
facts,'' Rossino said, ``and to accept that they exist.''
</P>
<P>
   Another panelist, Dutch filmmaker and historian Chris Vos, was
struck by how Americans not only have embraced that truth, but
imprinted the Holocaust story with their own values and lessons. As
Shandler put it, there is a sense of catharsis, of being a better
person morally for having seen Holocaust footage.
</P>
<P>
   This imprint extends beyond American borders through television
and movies,and is so pervasive that scholars speak of the
``Americanization'' of the Holocaust. American captivation with the
subject is visible every day in the lines of people outside the
Holocaust Museum; 14.4 million have walked through the doors since
they opened in 1993.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a remarkable, perhaps singular phenomenon. ... The
Holocaust touched only a small number of Americans directly ... yet
the Holocaust looms large in the American moral landscape, where it
has become commonplace to articulate the high magnitude of a social
wrong by deeming it `another Holocaust,''' Shandler wrote in
``While America Watches: Televising the Holocaust.''
</P>
<P>
   The panel of seven, headed by Doherty, joined the museum's own
historians and film experts each day to view films made between
1933 and 1985, including Nazi propaganda, U.S. Army Signal Corps
footage of the concentration camps, and both wartime and postwar
dramas and documentaries.
</P>
<P>
   As Michael Hoffman, an English professor from the University of
California at Davis, observed of one film, ``We are here analyzing
it as if it were a great poem.''
</P>
<P>
   And, in a sense, that is what they did.
</P>
<P>
   They compared, for instance, the ending of ``Schindler's List''
with that of ``Shoah,'' the 91/2-hour 1985 documentary whose name
means ``Holocaust'' in Hebrew. Spielberg's movie ends with a scene
in Israel, leaving viewers with the sense of something vital and
hopeful being created out of persecution and destruction. But there
is no redemption at the end of ``Shoah,'' no happy ending for
viewers to take home.
</P>
<P>
   ``You're supposed to ponder what's missing,'' Rossino said.
</P>
<P>
   Panelists carefully decoded images, identifying one woman in a
French documentary as a Nazi collaborator -- although some
initially mistook her for a camp survivor because of her shaved
head, a punishment imposed on collaborators. And they took note of
an early tendency in postwar films not to identify the victims of
the Nazis as Jews. As Vos explained of Dutch filmmakers, ``They
didn't want to do that, to do the same as the Germans by setting
apart the Jews.''
</P>
<P>
   Doherty wondered about the use of silence in some of the films
-- on what Vos called the film's ``soundscape.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We think of film as having so much of an aural component, but
we have very little of what the Holocaust sounded like,'' Doherty
said.
</P>
<P>
   Rossino described the panel's task this way: ``We're dealing
with history and evidence, and the reconstruction of that evidence
into a memory.''
</P>
<P>
   In the language of Holocaust scholars, that includes
``perpetrator images'' -- Nazi film and photographs. The bulk of
the museum's Poland, for example, were taken by the Nazis. They are
part of the historical record, Rossino said, ``whether we like it
or not.''
</P>
<P>
   The repulsion still felt for Nazi images influenced video
exhibits in the museum itself.
</P>
<P>
   David Thaxton, whose company created those videos, refrained
from using footage of ``Triumph of the Will,'' a 1935 Nazi
propaganda movie, to depict the Nazi rise to power. Doherty asked
why.
</P>
<P>
   Thaxton replied that, ``in the heart of this institution,'' to
do so would be ``morally reprehensible.''
</P>
<P>
   (FIRST OPTIONAL TRIM BEGINS)
</P>
<P>
   If anything, the panel's analysis only reaffirmed the power of
what Doherty calls ``perhaps the most horrifying footage of the
20th century.'' Near the end of their two weeks, he encouraged
guest speakers to fast-forward through the most gruesome frames,
saying, ``We've seen enough.''
</P>
<P>
   And Rossino was shaking off nightmares.
</P>
<P>
   He'd been unable to get out of his mind's eye the faces of Jews
forcibly crowded into the Warsaw Ghetto -- recorded by German
filmmakers before the Jews were deported to Treblinka, a Nazi
extermination camp in Poland. The panel had listened several days
earlier to a chilling account of that camp in ``Shoah.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The stink was carried on the wind,'' a former Nazi officer
told director Claude Lanzmann, describing mass graves up to 20 feet
deep. ``The brass was in a rush to clean out the Warsaw Ghetto.''
</P>
<P>
   In 1978, President Jimmy Carter created the Holocaust Commission
that led to the building of the museum within sight of the
Washington Monument, ``to ensure that we in the United States never
forget.''
</P>
<P>
   Remembering requires a story, and Eisenhower's order to turn the
camera on the camps imposed a narrative that persists. Shandler,
who briefly joined the panel for its deliberations, explained how
the liberation footage was perceived as a ``virtual witness of mass
death.'' Its viewers became witnesses. And Americans began to
attach a moral value to that.
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. Signal Corps and commercial newsreel cameramen
documented the horrors of the camps not only for American viewers,
but for future war crime trials -- such as the one held at
Nuremberg and dramatized recently in the TNT miniseries of the same
name.
</P>
<P>
   Germans were compelled to watch the films to confront their
individual and collective guilt, said panelist Susan Carruthers of
the University of Wales. There is even film of shaken Germans
leaving movie theaters. And, as Germany fell, the films were potent
evidence for the Allies of their moral superiority.
</P>
<P>
   Filmmakers have recycled this footage ever since, and often
without explanation.
</P>
<P>
   Carruthers, a cultural historian, spoke of the ``profound
afterlife of the footage taken in 1945.'' The films, she said, can
perpetuate ``things that we think we know about the Holocaust.''
</P>
<P>
   There is the myth, for one, that the corpses of Jewish prisoners
were used to make soap. ``Never been proven,'' Rossino said. The
myth's origins, Vos explained, were in World War I Allied
propaganda that the Germans made soap out of dead battlefield
horses. Ironically, rumors of World War II atrocities were
initially dismissed, in part because the first war's stories were
so exaggerated.
</P>
<P>
   The adaptation of historical footage for television and the
movies can create what Rossino calls a strange mix of confusion and
clarity. An Allied documentary on the Nazi concentration camps, for
instance, was shown during the war crimes trial at Nuremberg. That
footage was seen again in a 1950s teleplay about the trial, and
then again in TNT's ``Nuremberg.''
</P>
<P>
   Rossino's trained eye easily distinguishes between images shot
in different camps. But ordinary viewers are left to assume that
they depict a particular place. So while the television
dramatizations accurately used the footage shown at Nuremberg, the
images themselves left a misimpression. That may seem like a fine
point, but it clouds the historical accuracy of events that occupy
a sacred place in our memory.
</P>
<P>
   (FIRST OPTIONAL TRIM ENDS)
</P>
<P>
   Just as important as what the films show, Shandler argues, is
what has been edited out.
</P>
<P>
   The screened newsreel footage was only a fraction of what was
shot, and it was subject to both military censors and the
commercial sensibilities of film producers. The selected images
``reflect an agenda to depict Nazi atrocities at their most
thorough, extensive and graphic,'' Shandler wrote.
</P>
<P>
   And that, he believes, was at a cost to the survivors' humanity.
</P>
<P>
   Missing, Shandler wrote, were newsreel scenes of ``survivors as
striving to resume active lives, caring for themselves, expressing
religious, political and national identities, assisting in the
documentation of the atrocities committed by their former
persecutors, or paying homage to fellow inmates who did not
survive.''
</P>
<P>
   The narration of one early newsreel had admonished viewers:
</P>
<P>
   ``Don't turn away -- look!''
</P>
<P>
   So many Holocaust films have been made since that some panelists
argued that they comprise a separate film genre. At the very least,
they reveal our continuing compulsion to confront the Holocaust.
</P>
<P>
   (SECOND OPTIONAL TRIM FOLLOWS)
</P>
<P>
   Panelist David Brenner, of Kent State University's Ethnic
Heritage and Jewish Studies Program, commented during one session
on director Lanzmann's technique in ``Shoah.'' Lanzmann, long past
the point of comfortable silences during interviews, allowed the
camera to linger on his subjects. The camera held steady even on a
camp survivor struggling for composure, as she bit her lip and
gazed into the distance.
</P>
<P>
   ``We suffer with her,'' Hoffman, the UC-Davis scholar, observed.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps Brenner explained as well as anyone why we, like the
camera, can't look away.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you look at the person's face long enough, you'll get it,''
he said quietly. ``If you just stare long enough, you'll get it.''

RELIGION SHAPES BELIEVING TEENS' LIVES
</HEADLINE>

 By TARA DOOLEY 
 c.2000 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   FORT WORTH, Texas _ Even for a 12-year-old, God looms large in
daily life.
</P>
<P>
   Take Malcolm White.
</P>
<P>
   Before dinner, Malcolm thanks God in prayer.
</P>
<P>
   He reaches out to God for inspiration before a difficult test.
</P>
<P>
   He has stayed awake wondering about topics discussed during
worship services at Christ Chapel Bible Church in Fort Worth.
</P>
<P>
   He has even, on occasion, asked for a little help on the ball
field.
</P>
<P>
   ``I play first base,'' said Malcolm, a seventh-grader. ``If I
know there is a lefty who pulls toward me, maybe I'll sneak in a
little prayer.''
</P>
<P>
   Gratitude, inspiration and divine intervention may seem like
heady concerns for a small boy with sandy blond hair that peeks out
from under a baseball cap, but they are among the considerations
that occupy Malcolm, he said. God is the primary guide in his life,
he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Aside from my parents, God is the main factor,'' he said.
``Even with my parents, God is the main factor.''
</P>
<P>
   Sure, Malcolm may be an unusual 12-year-old in the earnestness
with which he expresses the convictions of his faith. But he is
certainly not alone in considering faith important in his youthful
life.
</P>
<P>
   ``Basically, I think without religion, I would be lost,'' said
16-year-old Omair Peracha, who attends prayers and religious
education classes at the Islamic Association of Mid-Cities in
Hurst, a Fort Worth suburb. ``I don't know what it would feel like
not having Islam as a belief system.''
</P>
<P>
   Faith is a matter of ultimate importance for believing teens,
they say. And their religious institutions become places where they
find responsibility, acceptance and comfort, teens say.
</P>
<P>
   The importance of religious institutions for believing teens
surprised author Laura Sessions Stepp as she followed 18 teens for
her book ``Our Last Best Shot: Guiding Our Children Through Early
Adolescence.''
</P>
<P>
   In observing teens from throughout the country _ 12 of whom she
wrote about _ Stepp discovered that it was often at religious
institutions that children found adults who listened with both
ears. These were adults who did not judge the teens and were free
from domestic distractions such as grocery bills, spouse trouble
and daily chores, she said.
</P>
<P>
   Religious institutions also encouraged teens to undertake
meaningful work, at soup kitchens or housing projects, for example.
And they were given positions of respect in choirs and
responsibility as event organizers.
</P>
<P>
   Religious organizations also encouraged teens to explore big
topics, such as life, death and their role in it all.
</P>
<P>
   Religion ``was a platform on which they could discuss issues
very close to their hearts with adults who took time to listen,''
said Stepp, who writes about family issues for The Washington Post.
</P>
<P>
   ``We can be the dumbest person on the Earth and still come here,
and it doesn't matter,'' 12-year-old Caroline Disney said of the
middle school Bible study she attends with Malcolm at Christ Chapel
Bible Church.
</P>
<P>
   Churches, mosques or temples were not the only places
adolescents found such guidance, support and encouragement, Stepp
said. But religious institutions were the places it occurred most
regularly, she said.
</P>
<P>
   Religious youth groups can also be simply the source of a good
time, teens say.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is a lot of fun,'' said 17-year-old Sarah Rousch, an
officer in the Fort Worth Federation of Temple Youth, a group of
teens associated with Congregation Beth-El in Fort Worth. ``It's
not all religious.''
</P>
<P>
   In addition to pool parties, Rousch includes cleaning food
pantries and sorting clothing for shelters as part of the fun.
</P>
<P>
   But faith is important to 14-year-old Jaclyn Jones, although the
Weatherford teen does not count herself among the most pious
members of her synagogue, Congregation Beth-El.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't consider myself really, really religious, but when I'm
in trouble I always turn to God,'' Jaclyn said.
</P>
<P>
   When discussing theology, Jaclyn said she often turns to her
best friend, a Baptist, finding similarities and differences in
each faith.
</P>
<P>
   ``We both kind of agree that you should believe what you feel in
your heart is true and what rings true to you, and that helps us
get along a lot better,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   At religious education classes, Jaclyn learns many of the values
that shape her life, as well as the history and traditions of the
Jewish people _ lessons that taught her to feel proud of her faith.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm only 14, and I'm still trying to establish what faith
means to me,'' Jaclyn said. ``I think people should establish for
themselves what they believe in. They have that right. ... But I
think it would be hard to have nothing to believe in. It must be
hard to live.''

LEADERSHIP OF FALUN GONG MOVEMENT IS DISPUTED 
</HEADLINE>
  (EDS: This early version will be updated as needed.) 
 By CRAIG S. SMITH   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   SHANGHAI, China _ Falun Gong followers in Hong Kong and the
United States are squabbling over claims by a woman in the southern
Chinese territory that she is the ``true Master'' of the spiritual
movement, having taken over from its founder, Li Hongzhi, who has
dropped from view.
</P>
<P>
   The power struggle is a potentially important one for Falun
Gong, which drew millions of adherents in the late 1990s, because
most of its followers are on the Chinese mainland, across the
border from Hong Kong.
</P>
<P>
   Hong Kong, a former British colony, reverted to Chinese rule in
1997. Whoever controls the group there has a chance of influencing
Falun Gong's development in the rest of China.
</P>
<P>
   So far, though, the recent revelation that matronly 37-year-old
Belinda Pang is the ``Lord of Buddhas'' has led to more of a cat
fight than catharsis for the movement, which went underground on
the mainland after Beijing banned the group a year ago. Li, who now
is based in New York, and Pang have traded accusations on competing
Web sites.
</P>
<P>
   The episode began on May 11 _ celebrated as Buddha's birthday
and, according to Li, his birthday as well (though birth records in
Li's hometown in China show otherwise). Pang, who had become a
tireless organizer in Falun Gong's Hong Kong chapter, organized a
march through the city to commemorate the day.
</P>
<P>
   Although only two dozen people turned up, most of them said they
had experienced a vision of Pang seated in outer space while angels
flew around her plucking flowers and dropping them to Earth. The
flowers turned into raindrops when they hit the skin, according to
Mary Qian, one of the people who saw the apparition.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's when we realized Ms. Pang was the Lord of Buddhas,''
Qian said by telephone Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   They announced the revelation on the Web site,
www.falundafa.com.hk.
</P>
<P>
   Li was quick to denounce Pang on Falun Gong's official web site
(www.minghui.ca), calling her ``a vile person'' suffering ``demonic
interference from her own mind.''
</P>
<P>
   Pang retorted by saying all recent messages from Li are fakes
because he has left the affairs of men to ``quietly watch
practitioners and people in the world'' from his perch on a cliff
somewhere in the United States, where he is pictured sitting on a
pillow in his last photograph posted on Falun Gong's Web site in
January.
</P>
<P>
   So far, Pang has only drawn about 30 hard-core believers. But,
Qian says people will slowly recognize Pang for what she is.
</P>
<P>
   ``When Jesus appeared, how many people believed him?'' she
asked.

VOTERS WILL HAVE A CLEAR CHOICE IN NOVEMBER &HT;    By HELEN THOMAS
 &HT;    c.2000 Hearst Newspapers
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHILADELPHIA _ Make no mistake about it: American voters will
have a clear-cut choice in the presidential election in November.
They will have to decide whether they want to turn the country to
the conservative right or continue on the current path of moderate
liberalism.
</P>
<P>
   In the leadup to the fall campaign, the Republican National
Convention has provided a choreographed showcase for Texas Gov.
George W. Bush to present the Republican Party as one big happy
family, marching in lockstep in what it hopes will be a parade to
the White House.
</P>
<P>
   The beatific facade may just work for the Republicans because
the ultra conservatives in the party have decided for the sake of
unity and the chance of victory to play ball with the man they
think can return them to power.
</P>
<P>
   The rightwingers of the party, however, did not have to swallow
everything to give Bush a chance to steal a page from President
Clinton's playbook and move to the middle. They were mollified by
the party's platform that would ban all abortions _ with no
exceptions for the life of the mother, incest or rape. And the
platform continues its hard line against any federal legal
protection of homosexuals against discrimination.
</P>
<P>
   As famed football coach Vince Lombardi used to say, ``Winning
isn't everything _ it's the only thing.'' Following that credo, the
uncompassionate conservatives _ assuming they are to the right of
Bush's self-identified ``compassionate conservatives'' _ have
pulled in their horns and decided that winning the White House is
more important than squabbling over issues. All is sweetness and
light in the City of Brotherly Love _ so much so that Ben
Kachigian, a master strategist of past Republican conventions is in
awe.
</P>
<P>
   Bush also won points with the conservatives by picking former
Defense Secretary Richard Cheney, a multimillionaire from the oil
services industry, to be his running mate. Cheney's record of
conservative votes in Congress appears extremist _ much more
conservative than the views of President George Bush who chose
Cheney to be secretary of defense.
</P>
<P>
   The younger Bush and his tightly-knit Texas team planned the
Philadelphia convention down to the minutes allotted each speaker.
They wanted no surprises and used an iron fist in a velvet glove to
get their way on everything. Discussing the lack of controversy and
confrontation that sometimes marred past conventions, Ken
Kachigian, former speechwriter and adviser to President Richard M.
Nixon, said on CNN that Nixon ``would have been impressed by the
control. He would have been envious.''
</P>
<P>
   Governor Bush has learned from the past. He did not want to
repeat the mistakes made at the 1992 GOP convention in Houston
where strident speeches by conservatives Marilyn Quayle and Patrick
Buchanan helped doom his father's reelection chances. Quayle told
the party faithful in Houston that not everyone in the sixties
``demonstrated, dropped out, took drugs, joined in the sexual
revolution or dodged the draft.'' Buchanan told the delegates that
there was a ``religious war going on for the soul of America, a
cultural war critical to the kind of nation we will be.''
</P>
<P>
   That kind of challenging language is missing in this convention,
where harmony is the theme.
</P>
<P>
   Parents are usually more conservative than their children, but
the opposite appears to be true in the Bush family. The Texas
governor has taken a rigid anti-abortion stand compared with that
of his mother, Barbara. Mrs. Bush refused to reveal her position on
the touchy subject when she was first lady, but right after she
left the White House, she promptly revealed her view that abortion
was a private matter between a woman and her physician.
</P>
<P>
   The governor's wife, Laura, refuses to disclose how she feels
about abortion, leading to speculation that she probably disagrees
with her husband on the subject that preoccupied the GOP candidates
throughout the primaries.
</P>
<P>
   The younger Bush seems to have missed his father's interest _
and ability _ in foreign affairs. But not to worry. He said he will
rely on ``good advisers,'' referring to the impressive big names he
has assembled from the Reagan and Bush eras who are waiting for
their second acts.
</P>
<P>
   When I looked at his biography for evidence of preparation for
the presidency, I found hardly anything in his past that reflected
a driving interest in public service until he suddenly made an
unsuccessful run for Congress in 1978. After hobnobbing with Texas
pols in that race, and later assisting his father in his vice
presidential and presidential campaigns, Bush was able to sharpen
his own political skills. For example, when he made that run for
Congress from West Texas, Bush was defeated by state senator Kent
Hance who portrayed himself as a ``good `ol boy'' populist
candidate. After that, Bush vowed that he would never be
``out-countrified'' again.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier this year, when he was running against Sen. John McCain
of Arizona in the Republican primaries, Bush soon figured out that
his aloofness toward reporters was getting him nowhere and getting
McCain everywhere. So Bush began to cozy up to the traveling
reporters, charming them with his friendliness, backslapping and
anointing them with nicknames.
</P>
<P>
   It worked, guaranteeing Bush media exposure as a likeable
fellow, given to banter with reporters. As one explained,``Who
wants to pass up a chance to talk to a future president?''
</P>
<P>
   In a year when the public has tuned out the campaign because the
nation is at peace and the economy is strong, Bush's ``likability''
may be his biggest plus. Al Gore, by contrast, is aloof and
reserved. But he is an expert on national issues by virtue of his
years in Congress and his eight years as vice president.
</P>
<P>
   When the voters begin to buckle down and really focus on the
election issues, they will see big philosophical and political
differences between the two parties. And that will give them a
clear-cut choice.

   Never mind that Mozart's concertos strike peaceful chords in
music lovers. In academia, the battle lines are drawn, and the next
salvo in the Mozart wars is about to be fired.
</P>
<P>
   Researchers are mustering data to counter those who are intent
on debunking the ``Mozart effect'' _ the theory that classical
music makes the brain work better _ and they have some high-profile
allies. President Clinton and the musician Billy Joel, for example,
spoke in June at a school in New York City's East Harlem that
received a donation of $5 million in musical instruments from VH1
Save the Music Foundation, in support of the notion that musical
education can provide a powerful intellectual stimulus.
</P>
<P>

   In May, Harold O. Levy, the chancellor of New York City's public
schools, surprised 43 school superintendents by arranging for them
to take a group violin lesson from Isaac Stern.

</P>
<P>
   Music educators have long claimed that music, one of
civilization's great gifts, bestows a bouquet of benefits upon
children. They say that music sharpens children's concentration and
makes them brighter and livelier.
</P>
<P>
   If music's beauty and mystery fail to impress cost-conscious
school boards, the thinking goes, then proving its ancillary
benefits might save music programs from the budgetary ax wielded by
those who regard music as an expensive luxury unrelated to reading,
writing and `rithmetic.
</P>
<P>
   To help determine who is right, an array of scientists is
studying how music works in the brain. The researchers have
analyzed babies' responses to lullabies, as well as their awareness
of pitch and rhythm, showing, in some studies, that infants
experience music much as adults do. We arrive ready to join the
band, the scientists say, but too often the instruments have been
packed away by schools that no longer use them.
</P>
<P>
   A report that will appear in the fall issue of the Journal of
Aesthetic Education, published by the University of Illinois Press,
suggests that those instruments should be hauled out and tuned up.
According to the report, written by Lois Hetland, a cognitive
psychologist at Project Zero, a research organization co-directed
by Howard Gardner at the Harvard Graduate School of Education,
something happens to young children when they are given keyboard
lessons for several months or years: while the instruction lasts,
and for up to two years afterward, the children's performance on
spatial reasoning tests improves.
</P>
<P>
   That observation was the genesis of the term ``Mozart effect,''
which has been trademarked by the musician and author Don Campbell,
although his new book, ``The Mozart Effect For Children,'' to be
published in September by William Morrow, is unrelated to the study
that started the debate.
</P>
<P>
   In the original 1993 study, Gordon L. Shaw and Frances H.
Rauscher showed that a small group of college students performed
better on certain spatial-reasoning tests after listening to a
Mozart sonata. The so-called ``effect'' _ an increased ability to
``see'' the design of a snowflake, for example, after mentally
cutting and folding a piece of paper, or to rotate and compare
objects conceptually in space _ lasted only 10 to 15 minutes, but
the news was treated like a formula to get smart quick.
</P>
<P>
   Classical music seemed like the latest mega-vitamin: a little
hard to swallow, but so good for you. The theory, which made the
rounds of magazines in cover stories, quickly found its biggest
audience in the conscientious parents of young children and to the
parents of children-to-be, who hurried to buy specially packaged
music CDs so they could play Pachelbel's Canon to their babies in
utero.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   In Georgia, no purchase was necessary for newborns. Gov. Zell
Miller, citing the Mozart effect, proposed in 1998 providing the
parents of every Georgia newborn with a classical music cassette or
compact disc. Sony produced the albums free, and they were included
in gift packets at hospitals. The Mozart data was absorbed into
current views of cognitive development, and parents rushed to
improve those new brains.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Some neuroscientists, however, cringed at the simplistic
scenario. So did Rauscher, who cautioned against distorting her
team's modest findings. The Mozart hype, especially in relation to
infants, was ripe for puncturing, and Dr. John Bruer obliged in his
book, ``The Myth of the First Three Years,'' published last fall by
Free Press. Bruer, president of the McDonnell Foundation in St.
Louis, which finances research in neuroscience and cognition,
argued that no one need rush to program music or anything else into
babies' brains. The brain, he reassured parents, was most likely
malleable for life.
</P>
<P>
   Hetland, whose work addresses college students as well as
preschool and elementary-school children, conducted two
comprehensive analyses of all the known studies of the subject as
part of Project Zero's Reviewing Education in the Arts Project,
which she served as manager.
</P>
<P>
   In the first analysis, more than 2,000 college students
participating in 31 studies listened to several different kinds of
music, as well as to silence and to a vocal-relaxation tape. They
scored higher on spatial-reasoning tests after they heard Mozart,
Schubert and Mendelssohn than under any other conditions, including
listening to music by Philip Glass, Pearl Jam and other rock
groups. Music with a complex structure and rhythm won out over
repetitious, more predictable music, Hetland said.
</P>
<P>
   Advocates of music in the schools say that it is good, but not
enough, to sit children in an auditorium and present them with a
well-played rendition of ``Peter and the Wolf.'' For children to
benefit most, they need to make music themselves, those advocates
say.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, Hetland's second analysis showed that. It involved 700
preschool and elementary school children who participated in 15
different studies. Some children received weekly 15-minute periods
of active music instruction, both individually and in groups. They
listened to music and moved to its rhythms, played percussion
instruments like triangles, rhythm sticks and cymbals, sang and
took piano lessons. The control groups received either passive
music instruction, computerized reading and arithmetic instruction
or no special instruction.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The gap between the before-and-after scores on spatial-reasoning
tests of the children who received active music instruction was
much greater than the gaps in the scores of the children in the
control groups, Hetland said. She defined spatial skill as the
ability to conceive of and understand the placement of objects and
images in two- or three-dimensional space. The test scores of
children who learned to read notes on a musical staff jumped
highest of all.
</P>
<P>
   ``This does give music education advocates a lobbying tool, if
they want to justify a music program,'' Hetland said. Surgeons,
engineers and archaeologists need spatial skills. So do artists and
chess players. ``Spatial instruction is a great way to teach
math,'' she said. ``If you can enhance people's spatial ability
through a program of music instruction, we're not sure why, but
most kids would benefit.''
</P>
<P>
   That lack of an explanation for the demonstrated benefit of
music instruction keeps controversy bubbling in the overlapping
fields of cognitive science and early-childhood education. Does
music per se improve mental gymnastics? Or is the spatial-reasoning
effect a result of something else _ the spatial patterns made by
the black and white keys on the keyboard, perhaps, or a factor like
change of mood after participating in music?
</P>
<P>
   Dr. E. Glenn Schellenberg, an associate professor of psychology
at the University of Toronto, is skeptical about the Project Zero
report. ``Just because there's an association doesn't mean it's
causal,'' he said. ``They've got to show that the effect is
specific to music. The right experiment has not been done.''
</P>
<P>
   Schellenberg has a $150,000 grant from the International
Foundation for Music Research in San Diego to give 36 weeks of free
arts lessons to 6-year-olds, beginning in September, randomly
assigning groups of children to keyboard, voice or drama classes.
``We'll be looking to see whether the two music groups show greater
levels of improvement on before-and-after-tests than the drama
groups,'' he said, ``and whether the two music groups differ.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Who knows,'' he added, ``music could be special.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   But some music teachers are impatient with the plodding
scientific approach. ``I don't need proof,'' said Lisha Papert
Lercari, director of the Music and the Brain Project of the 42nd
Street Development Fund in Manhattan, which has developed a
keyboard program that is now being taught in 23 schools ``The kids
are discovering form and patterns, and noticing things we never
saw.''
</P>
<P>
   She said the keyboard training, which involves reading music,
also helped immigrant Hispanic children in Queens pick up English
unusually fast, a language effect she expects to document in a
nearly completed study.
</P>
<P>
   Educators like Lercari regard Rauscher, one of the original
Mozart-effect researchers, as their spokeswoman. Not surprisingly,
Rauscher was elated by the advance news of Hetland's report. ``I
think that to ignore these findings is really to do a disservice to
the children who can benefit most from them, especially
disadvantaged children,'' Rauscher said. ``These are kids whose
parents can't afford the time or the money to take them to piano
lessons. They really rely on the public schools for this, and a
prekindergarten program would be the ideal place to start.''
</P>
<P>
   Rauscher, a former concert cellist who is now an assistant
professor of cognitive development at the University of Wisconsin
at Oshkosh, has conducted her own research since 1993 and
consistently found higher spatial-reasoning scores correlating with
keyboard and xylophone instruction for elementary school children.
</P>
<P>
   Singing also has its place in the new emphasis on musicmaking.
In White Plains, N.Y., which was recently named one of the top 10
communities in the country for music education in a survey
conducted by the American Music Conference, the National
Association for Music Education, the Music Teachers National
Association and the National School Boards Association, singing is
being integrated into prekindergarten and kindergarten classrooms.
</P>
<P>
   Teresa Niss, coordinator of fine arts programs in the White
Plains schools, said that if kindergarten children are learning
about the letter ``S,'' for example, they may sing songs about
snakes and starfish. Musical counts help illustrate groups of
numbers, while songs sung in connection with pictures facilitate
reading.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have seen changes in children's language development faster
than we normally would,'' she said. The district is 35 percent
Hispanic, and like Lercari, Niss said that Hispanic children
arriving in school without knowledge of English ``are acquiring the
language more quickly'' after their exposure to the music program.
</P>
<P>
   With a $100,000 three-year grant, provided by Texaco and the
Eastman School of Music through their Partnership Opportunities
program, the district recently extended its program to
prekindergarten students and brought Linda P. Neelly, an
early-childhood music consultant in Rochester, into the lower
grades to work with music teachers and classroom teachers.
</P>
<P>
   One recent morning, Neelly gathered kindergarten students in a
circle and asked them to take turns singing their names as she beat
the rhythm on a tambourine. Then, in a clear and melodious voice,
she repeated what each child had sung, enticing the children into a
musical conversation as they drew or worked on group activities.
When groups of children drifted over to a xylophone on the floor,
she used it to make up songs with them.
</P>
<P>
   The class illustrated Neelly's view that music should flow
naturally throughout the school day, much as the arts are taught
``through the curriculum'' in some middle and high schools.
</P>
<P>
   For this to happen, classroom teachers must also become
musicmakers, and part of Neelly's job was to show them how. For
example, one technique was to ask the teachers to sing in a higher
key than normal so that children could replicate the sound.
``Children will sing in tune if they sing higher,'' Niss said.
</P>
<P>
   All the musical failures critics portray seemed to fall on the
small shoulders of Aifa, who was silent when it was her turn to
sing her name in a White Plains classroom. ``I don't know how to
sing,'' she said, crestfallen. Neelly moved on to the next child,
but when the group sang together later, Aifa joined in. No longer
in the spotlight, she found her natural voice, which, music
advocates say, is like finding herself.
</P>
<P>
   ``Every child has innate musical capacity,'' Neelly said. ``If
we're not tapping in and finding ways to develop that ability,
we're not doing our job as educators.''

<P>
   PHILADELPHIA _ Former President Gerald Ford suffered two minor
strokes and was hospitalized early Wednesday morning, hours after
suffering dizziness and slurred speech at the Republican National
Convention, doctors said.
</P>
<P>
   Ford, 87, first went to Hahnemann University Hospital after
leaving the convention, where he had been honored in an emotional
tribute. He was misdiagnosed with a sinus infection and released.
Hours later, he returned with additional symptoms.
</P>
<P>
   Wednesday afternoon, the former president was in the hospital's
intensive care unit and underwent an MRI scan that showed he had
suffered two small strokes in the last two days, said Dr. Robert J.
Schwartzman, the hospital's head of neurology.
</P>
<P>
   There was no apparent brain damage, the doctor said.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's doing well,'' Schwartzman said. ``He's perfectly awake, a
little weak in the left arm and a little unbalanced.''
</P>
<P>
   The doctor said the stroke occurred ``mainly in his balance
center in the back of his brain.'' When asked about possible brain
damage, he said, ``I don't think so.''
</P>
<P>
   Ford would be in the hospital five to six days, Schwartzman
said.
</P>
<P>
   Ford first went to the hospital around midnight Tuesday, and he
was given an antibiotic for a sinus infection and released. Calvin
McDowell, a spokesman for Ford, had said a wax build-up had led to
the infection.
</P>
<P>
   Ford left the hospital at 1:36 a.m. with his wife, Betty. ``I
feel good, that's why I'm here,'' Ford said as he climbed into his
car.
</P>
<P>
   Hours later, Ford asked to be taken back to the hospital after
complaining of feeling ``uncomfortable, McDowell said. The former
president walked in, after refusing a wheelchair, McDowell said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We just thought we had a routine sinus infection, but then he
had other problems and he was brought back,'' McDowell said.
</P>
<P>
   Ford appeared frail as he sat in a VIP box at the back of the
First Union Center on Tuesday night along with his wife, former
President George Bush, former first lady Barbara Bush and other
prominent Republicans. He was visibly moved when a video-taped
tribute to him was displayed on the large screens inside the hall.
</P>
<P>
   ``When uncertainty troubled our nation, President Gerald Ford
renewed America's confidence,'' Gov. George Pataki of New York
said, introducing the tribute. ``His strength, his strength and
integrity defended our values at home in an ever-changing world.''
</P>
<P>
   The crowd cheered when Pataki invoked ``President Ford's steady
leadership and Mrs. Ford's gentle grace.''
</P>
<P>
   He rose and waved to acknowledge the cheers of the audience.
</P>
<P>
   Ford did not address the convention, and told C-Span that this
would be the last convention he and his wife would attend, calling
it a ``concluding appearance to indicate our support.''
</P>
<P>
   When asked about his health in an interview Tuesday night on
CNN's ``Larry King Live,'' the former president said, ``I couldn't
be healthier.''

IN FREE-SPIRITED PLAY, A DEPARTED SPIRIT LIVES 
</HEADLINE>
   By PETER OLAFSON    
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   The ghost of Looking Glass Studios hovers about me as I explore
Deus Ex. The specter of that celebrated game developer, which
closed its doors in May, whispers in my ear as the story folds
conspiracy upon conspiracy. It cackles softly as I fumble for
equipment to master the game's electronic locks and struggle to
recall passwords. It curls about my ankles like an unseen cat as I
stand in darkness and debate my next direction. I have many choices
and, in most of them, the ghost follows close upon my heels.
</P>
<P>
   Looking Glass did not participate in the design of Deus Ex, an
action and role-playing game that was developed by Ion Storm in
Austin, Texas. But the producer of Deus Ex, Warren Spector, worked
on Looking Glass' two Ultima Underworld games, System Shock and
Thief, and he appears to have brought to this new game the restless
spirit and the delightful sense of freedom associated with that
studio's best work.
</P>
<P>
   The appearance of Deus Ex within weeks of Looking Glass'
shutting down had the feel of an epitaph. But it is a grand,
poignant epitaph that pays a compliment both to the Looking Glass
legacy and to the skill of Spector and his team.
</P>
<P>
   Computer and video games tend to slide into the nearest
convenient hole. Although the details vary, you can reasonably
predict that a role-playing game will be driven by relentless
combat. An adventure game will unfold a story in puzzles. An action
game will send you out to kill.
</P>
<P>
   Looking Glass games were different. Beginning with the Ultima
Underworld games in the early 1990s, Looking Glass consistently
expanded the boundaries of the genres in which it worked. Terra
Nova: Strike Force Centauri was one of the first 3-D games to offer
squad-based combat. Even when Looking Glass spread its wings and
delved into unfamiliar genres _ flight simulation, with the Flight
Unlimited series, and sports, with British Open Championship Golf _
it did so with panache. The flight simulators were written for
passengers as much as for pilots and the golf game had wonderful
crowds.
</P>
<P>
   But Looking Glass found its true calling in its 3-D
action-adventure games. Games like System Shock, Thief: The Dark
Project and their recent sequels belonged to no single genre. They
were action, role-playing and adventure games living under one
roof, mingled so closely that you could not easily tell where one
genre left off and the next began.
</P>
<P>
   The result was the purest, freest kind of play, unhindered by
categories, rules or expectations and, finally, not even by the
machine on which it operated. (Looking Glass Games always seemed to
hover in the ether between the player and the screen.) The typical
measures of role-playing games _ the experience points and
character statistics _ became irrelevant as you effectively became
the on-screen character. Just as the genres melted into one
another, the player melted into the game.
</P>
<P>
   Which brings us to Deus Ex. Set in a plague-ravaged world, the
game casts you as a technologically augmented agent named J.C.
Denton, who is working for a United Nations anti-terrorist unit.
The story laid out for him at the end of the first of 15 missions
sounds like a paranoid's nightmare. (The government started the
plague for population control. The Trilateral Commission is behind
a secret government. I am just waiting for a reference to black
helicopters.) The paranoia gains in strength and resonance as the
game progresses. Soon enough, you will not know what to believe.
</P>
<P>
   Like its Looking Glass antecedents, Deus Ex presents the player
with a wide range of fascinating and well-distributed tasks. It is
pleasantly, albeit sinisterly, full of alternate approaches, things
to do and things to find and use. It never does the same thing for
too long and thus never allows you to grow weary with a single
conceit.
</P>
<P>
   There are newspapers to be read, locked doors to be unlocked,
characters to be questioned (and re-questioned). There are people
to shoot, and people to avoid. There are enhancements to bestow
upon your character. There are experiments to perform with exotic
inventory items. There are computers to be hacked. There are
out-of-the-way places to be explored (with attached
experience-point bonuses).
</P>
<P>
   The twist in Deus Ex is the psychological state of the player.
In the Looking Glass games, your actions were always imbued with
purpose, but in Deus Ex, they come to be imbued with doubt. After
an initial aggressive foray up a headless and torchless Statue of
Liberty, I found myself growing steadily more tentative, shocking
enemies into unconsciousness instead of shooting them, asking
questions first and paying more attention to who I wanted my
character to be than to what he could do. Almost without knowing
it, I had slipped into his skin.
</P>
<P>
   These are a few of my favorite things. It is not the end of the
list, and I am not even sure that I can make a list. I can't begin
to remember all the loose ends I want to follow up _ missions are
still tugging at my cuffs, begging to be replayed in different
fashion _ and I have no doubt that there are other, looser ends I
will discover if I look long enough and hard enough.
</P>
<P>
   Deus Ex is not quite perfect. It lacks some of the sense of
balance and grace of the Looking Glass games, and since it is
spread over disparate levels around the world, it lacks some of the
wholeness of being sited in a single ominous place. But its open
structure and varied play should serve to encourage movement toward
games that are less defined by genre and more by immersiveness and
fun. At the very least, it should help foster a fertile climate for
coming transgenre efforts like Loose Cannon, an action-driving
game; Giants: Citizen Kabuto, an action-strategy game; and Oni, an
action-fighting game. Then again, playing mix-and-match with genres
can be risky. In 1997 and 1998, two action-strategy hybrids,
Uprising and Battlezone, garnered much critical acclaim but failed
to capture the public imagination.
</P>
<P>
   If Deus Ex is a hit, Looking Glass will not be around to
celebrate. But its reflection lingers.
</P>
<P>
   (Deus Ex, developed by Ion Storm; published by Eidos Interactive
for Windows 95 and 98, $39.95; published by Aspyr for Macintosh 8.1
and later, $49.95; for players 17 and older.)

ONLINE SELLERS VULNERABLE TO CREDIT CARD FRAUD

<P>
   Connie Bacon, a regular seller on eBay, thought that she had
brokered an excellent deal. On behalf of a consignment shop in
Charleston, S.C., she had sold a Rolex watch for $13,500 in an
online auction, and everything had gone smoothly.
</P>
<P>
   A man who identified himself as Kelvin Johanis had put the money
in an escrow account, assuring Bacon that the payment was good, and
the shopkeeper had shipped the package to a house specified by the
buyer in Lynwood, Wash.
</P>
<P>
   A few hours later, Bacon got an urgent e-mail message from
I-Escrow, the company holding the payment. I-Escrow said the buyer
was suspected of using a stolen credit card. Please, the message
pleaded, do not ship the watch.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was shaking,'' Bacon said. ``This was a $13,500 watch that
wasn't mine.''
</P>
<P>
   She had good reason to be concerned. Online sellers are even
more vulnerable to fraud than online buyers, experts say. Those who
buy faulty or fake goods through online auctions or Web shops have
some recourse; insurance programs and credit-card companies will
often come to their rescue and credit their accounts, at least up
to a certain amount.
</P>
<P>
   But individuals who are selling goods in online auctions have
little protection. Stolen credit cards, fake money orders and
bounced checks are risks they face. For them, the adage is turned
on its head: Seller beware.
</P>
<P>
   In Bacon's case, she was not the only Ebay seller who did
business with the person who called himself Johanis. His real name
was Michael Prime, according to court documents, and he turned out
to be a 19-year-old unemployed high school graduate in Brier, Wash.
</P>
<P>
   According to I-Escrow's investigators (informally known as the
fraud squad), Prime had opened 25 accounts on the I-Escrow system
and had been in contact with at least nine sellers. He had used
stolen credit cards to get almost $20,000 worth of merchandise,
including laptop computers, other Rolex watches and three
remote-controlled scale-model helicopters.
</P>
<P>
   When people worry about fraud in online auctions, they do not
usually think about buyers like Prime. They assume that they are
most likely to be deceived by sellers _ particularly by people
hawking counterfeit or broken merchandise.
</P>
<P>
   ``That is really not true,'' said Dr. Audri Lanford, a
sociologist and editor of an e-mail newsletter, Scambusters.org.
``Fraud is a huge issue, but it is from the seller's perspective.''
</P>
<P>
   In fact, online sellers are 1O to 18 times as likely as bricks
and mortar merchants to lose merchandise to people using stolen
credit cards, according to a survey by the Gartner Group, a market
research company. The survey, which was released in July and polled
166 retailers, showed that 1.13 percent of all online transactions
were conducted with stolen cards.
</P>
<P>
   Once online sellers accept a stolen card, they often find that
the credit card company is of no help. Under federal law, the owner
of the credit card would not have to pay for those items. The
credit card companies do not have to cover the cost either; they
are only liable for the purchases if the seller received a
signature from the card holder. So the seller bears the cost and
will never be paid.
</P>
<P>
   A year ago, that might not have sounded like an issue for
consumers to worry about. But now, with auction sites like those
offered by eBay, Yahoo and Amazon.com, consumers can be sellers as
easily as they can be buyers. Today, millions of people are selling
goods online, with no background in running a business and none of
the resources used by traditional businesses if things go awry.
</P>
<P>
   Until recently, most individuals selling through online auctions
have not been able to accept credit cards and have had to worry
only about bounced checks. But this spring, the introduction of
credit-card services like Billpoint have made it possible for
anyone _ even someone selling one item _ to take credit cards
online. Now people who have no business savvy, and who may simply
be selling miscellaneous items to clean out their basements, are
vulnerable to the same credit card fraud that is plaguing online
merchants.
</P>
<P>
   Bacon, an antique-glassware trader who can often be spotted on
eBay under the name GrayHorse, was an experienced online auctioneer
when she decided to help a consignment shop sell the Rolex last
summer. She had already run into only a few problems, mainly with
buyers who retracted their bids. But she still was not prepared
when she heard that sellers she was acting for had been defrauded
by Prime. ``I felt very violated,'' she said. ``It made me very
angry.''
</P>
<P>
   Prime, it turned out, was doing more than simply using stolen
credit cards. Those involved with the case say that he is a whiz
with computers, though he has little education beyond high school.
His lawyer, Tim Tesh, described his client as ``one of these
self-taught kids who can just pick it up.''
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   According to I-Escrow, Prime first registered for accounts using
stolen cards in July 1999. But I-Escrow detected that the accounts
were based on stolen cards and quickly canceled them.
</P>
<P>
   So Prime tried to get around the system. According to I-Escrow,
he told sellers that he wanted to use I-Escrow and would start the
process of setting up accounts. But instead of completing the
transaction through the escrow service, officials said, Prime would
close the deal by pretending to be an escrow agent and sending
messages from ``I(underscore)Escrow(at)Hotmail.com,'' an e-mail
address that looked a lot like I-Escrow's official messages, which
end with ``IEscrow.com.'' Using that disguise, he told sellers that
the money had been deposited and that they should go ahead and ship
their items.
</P>
<P>
   The first person to be deceived, I-Escrow said, was a
Bellingham, Wash., man who was selling a Macintosh Powerbook G3 in
July 1999.
</P>
<P>
   According to I-Escrow's records, he also purchased two
remote-controlled helicopters and two Rolex watches a week later
using fake e-mail messages.
</P>
<P>
   But one other case involving a remote-controlled helicopter
worked a little differently. The seller, Bobby DeRosa, was a Web
designer in San Diego, and Prime did not try to use a fake e-mail
address. Instead, I-Escrow said, he used a credit card that had not
yet been listed by banks as stolen and then asked DeRosa to direct
the shipment to an address that was different from the one on the
card.
</P>
<P>
   By the end of July, I-Escrow had been tipped off by the seller
of the Apple computer, who had checked the company's Web site to
view his account's status and had been baffled to find that the
transaction was listed as ``still pending.'' He forwarded to
I-Escrow the fake message that included the real shipping address:
14501 Highway 99 in Lynwood, Wash.
</P>
<P>
   I-Escrow officials called the sheriff's office there, in
Snohomish County. A detective, Matt Trafford, drove to the address
on Highway 99, a four-lane commercial road, and found what looked
like an abandoned house that had been ``sitting there rotting for
years,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Inside the house, Trafford said, he found credit card receipts
and registration papers for a nearby storage business.
</P>
<P>
   Trafford wanted to be waiting when the next shipment was
delivered to the house. He asked I-Escrow if its records showed
another shipment. Yes, it looked as though another Rolex watch was
about to be purchased, from an eBay seller in South Carolina:
Bacon.
</P>
<P>
   This was the same week that Bacon received that urgent e-mail
message telling her not to ship the watch. The minute she saw that
message, Bacon had called the consignment shop but had discovered,
to her dismay, that the watch had already been packed and delivered
to the post office. ``I called the post office,'' she said, and
found to her relief that the package was still there. ``I said: `Oh
thank you, Jesus. Please do not send that watch out.'''
</P>
<P>
   Bacon then agreed to help I-Escrow and the sheriff's office. She
found an old chipped soap dish that weighed about as much as the
watch, wrapped it up and sent it to her buyer. Across the country
in Lynwood, Wash., Trafford was waiting, watching the abandoned
house through the windows of a nearby store.
</P>
<P>
   But the soap dish never made its way to the abandoned house.
Prime picked it up at the Federal Express office instead and threw
it into a gasoline station's trash can after he opened it.
Detective Trafford, however, was still able to find Prime. By
talking to witnesses at the Federal Express office, the detective
learned that Prime rode a blue-and-white motorcycle and used a
nearby storage business. On a visit to the site, the detective
spotted the motorcycle and noted its license plate number. The
number led him to find snapshots of Prime that were on file from a
previous arrest. ( Prime said he had pleaded guilty a few days
earlier to stealing a laptop computer.
</P>
<P>
   Soon, with help from I-Escrow and eBay, the detective had enough
information to make an arrest. Prime was picked up at his mother's
house, and the police said they had found a Rolex watch and two
stolen credit cards there. Prime said he took the cards after
finding them in automated teller machines. He was charged with
theft and two counts of possession of stolen property. He denied
the charges at first, posted bail and a few months later moved from
his mother's house.
</P>
<P>
   That move led to another visit from the authorities, this time
from a probation officer who had been assigned to Prime after he
pleaded guilty to the previous theft, which was in King County. The
officer came to do a routine check of Prime's new residence. During
a search of the apartment, he found a tin can in a cabinet. As soon
as the officer opened the can, a firecracker rocket inside ignited,
according to Prime's affidavit. The flame from the rocket was
apparently intended to destroy the contents, but detectives were
still able to identify them: another stolen credit card, a stolen
debit card and fake identification cards.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Prime eventually pleaded guilty to five felony counts (the three
earlier charges plus a count for possessing an incendiary device
and a count of forgery), and he was sentenced to 22 months at the
Airway Heights Correctional Center in eastern Washington. In the
interview this week, he said he had learned his lesson and was
hoping to take a computer-related job someday. ``I was emotionally
depressed and doing stupid things,'' he said. ``I made a bad
choice.''
</P>
<P>
   The case of Prime may sound more complex than most cases of
credit-card fraud, but officials at companies like I-Escrow and
CyberSource, which provides verification services to online
merchants, say they have been seeing more incidents like this
recently. ``The con artists today are getting much more crafty,''
said Vince Gottman, i-Escrow's senior director for customer support
and the leader of the fraud squad.
</P>
<P>
   I-Escrow, for example, recently caught a buyer trying to
complete a transaction using a check stolen from his employer.
CyberSource officials said they had seen an increasing number of
international cases. A buyer will ask that goods be sent to a
location outside the United States but will use a credit card with
a billing address inside the United States. In many cases, they
say, the credit card being used is a stolen card.
</P>
<P>
   ``One bad buyer out there can do a lot of damage,'' said Tom
Arnold, chief technology officer at CyberSource.
</P>
<P>
   Most businesses already know this. ``You have to build that into
the cost of business,'' said Janet Crane, chief executive of
Billpoint, the credit-card system used by many people on eBay.
Crane acknowledged, however, that most eBay users did not have the
business experience to protect themselves.
</P>
<P>
   Billpoint works like most credit card companies and will not
cover a seller's costs when a transaction has gone bad. This week,
the company started offering a new feature to give sellers more
protection. The service, called Electronic Check, will let sellers
receive money directly from a buyer's checking account, instead of
through a credit card. But the service has a three-day waiting
period, so Billpoint can make sure that the check clears. If a
fraudulent check goes through, the service will reimburse sellers
up to $200.
</P>
<P>
   A few services offer guarantees if a card is used and later
determined to be stolen. I-Escrow, for example, gave refunds to the
sellers who were defrauded by Prime. The company now asks its users
to ensure that messages are legitimate by comparing the information
they get in e-mail messages that appear to be from I-Escrow with
what I-Escrow shows in their Web-based accounts. But if sellers do
everything that is asked of them and are still defrauded, I-Escrow
says, it will cover the cost of any lost items.
</P>
<P>
   Ecount, a service that enables people to use credit cards on the
Web, also says that it will cover the cost of bad transactions and
cover payments that are owed to a seller even if a credit card
turns out to be stolen. PayPal, another payment service, also
offers a guarantee, but only if users have completed a three-step
verification process when setting up accounts. About 10 percent of
PayPal's customers do so, said Elon Musk, chief executive of X.com,
the company behind PayPal.
</P>
<P>
   For the most part, experts say, sellers should not panic. Kevin
Pursglove, eBay's spokesman, added that ``99.997 percent of
transactions have satisfactory buyers and sellers.'' Yahoo Auctions
and other auction sites also stress that most sales are completed
without a hitch.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, Bacon said she had not been dissuaded from selling her
glassware on eBay, and she is still using I-Escrow for high-priced
items. In addition, it is likely that she may have been protected
from having to pay the cost of the watch, since she was selling it
for another shop.
</P>
<P>
   But she is also wary. Now she warns sellers to review the
procedures on auction and escrow services before using them.
``Fully understand what the process should be,'' she said, ``so you
can't get fooled like I did.''

<P>
   A NEW CAVEAT FOR eBAY USERS: SELLER BEWARE
</P>
<P>
   Sellers may be 10 times as likely to run into credit card fraud
over the Internet as in the physical world. Here are some things
online sellers should watch:
</P>
<P>
   SHIPPING _ Ship the item only to the address listed on the
credit card. People using stolen cards, of course, want purchases
to come to them, not to card holders.
</P>
<P>
   TIMING _ Don't sell to a buyer who appears anxious to purchase
an item and offers a premium to buy it before the auction ends. A
holder of a stolen card is usually in a hurry to use it before the
theft is reported.
</P>
<P>
   SHIPPING _ Be wary of any buyer who requests expensive overnight
shipping and offers to cover the costs.
</P>
<P>
   E-MAIL _ Be wary of buyers using free e-mail services like
Hotmail or Juno.com. Many honest people use free e-mail, but these
accounts allow senders to be anonymous.
</P>
<P>
   PAYMENTS _ Don't let the buyer split up the payment for an item
by making, say, 10 payments of $500 instead of one $5,000 payment.
The buyer may be trying to stay under the radar of credit card
companies, who pay extra attention to large purchases. &QL;

SOUTH AFRICA WILL NO LONGER RELEASE STATISTICS ON CRIME 
</HEADLINE>
  (EDS: This early version will be updated as needed.) 
 By HENRI E. CAUVIN   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   JOHANNESBURG, South Africa _ South Africa's minister of safety
and security has ordered an indefinite moratorium on the release of
crime statistics, saying the system for collecting such information
here in one of the world's most crime-plagued countries is flawed
and unreliable.
</P>
<P>
   After reportedly denying plans for a blackout _ an idea
unpopular with some legislators and specialists _ the minister,
Steve Tshwete, and the national police commissioner, Jackie Selebi,
have in the past week reversed themselves and acknowledged the
decision.
</P>
<P>
   Selebi, the first black commissioner to lead the 120,000-member
national police service, has been the man in the spotlight on
crime, planning a national initiative with quick and dramatic
results that have yet to materialize.
</P>
<P>
   Many critics concede that methods for collecting and analyzing
crime statistics are problematic; they support the work of a task
force that began meeting this week to hammer out a plan for
correcting the problems.
</P>
<P>
   But some also argue that keeping the public in the dark about
crime rates for months, even as the information in question
continues to be used to plan an anti-crime strategy, is
questionable.
</P>
<P>
   ``They say, `We know the statistics are flawed, and we're going
to correct them,''' said Eric Pelser, who studies the South African
Police Service for the Institute for Security Studies in Pretoria.
``At the same time they have a crime control strategy that is
dependent on these statistics. They're focusing on places that have
been identified based on these crime statistics, which raises the
question of how they were identified.''
</P>
<P>
   Few of the country's problems have done more to discourage
foreign investment and international tourism than the high
violent-crime rate. Selebi's response has been the initiative,
called Operation Crackdown, which he began in April, three months
after taking office.
</P>
<P>
   Carjackings and other types of robberies, widely considered a
barometer of personal safety, have climbed steadily since 1994,
according to the last crime statistics released by the police
before the moratorium took effect this month.
</P>
<P>
   The murder rate has declined modestly during the past five
years, to 55.3 per 100,000 in 1999 from 69.3 per 100,000 in 1994,
according to an analysis by the Institute for Security Studies. But
it remains among the highest in the world, and much of the decrease
has been attributed to the gradual falloff in politically motivated
killings that racked the country in the mid-1990s, during the
transition to black-majority rule.
</P>
<P>
   The commissioner's spokeswoman, Sally De Beer, insists that his
request for a moratorium on the statistics is not an attempt to
deflect attention from the challenges facing the police.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not that we're covering up or trying to clamp down on bad
news,'' she said. ``We've been totally open.''
</P>
<P>
   She added, ``Commissioner Selebi uses these crime statistics to
plan operations and to deploy personnel, and he doesn't want to
plan his operation on what could be faulty data.''
</P>
<P>
   She said the moratorium would last ``months, not years.''
</P>
<P>
   Douglas Gibson, chief whip of the opposition Democratic Party
and a frequent critic of the police service, said the explanations
offered so far were unconvincing.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it's the biggest load of nonsense I've ever heard,''
Gibson said. ``I think it's like the minister of education saying
we have education problems and I'm not letting anyone take final
examinations until we've sorted them out.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   The flaws and limitations of the police system, particularly the
lack of precision in classifying types of crimes and pinpointing
where they occur, were identified more than two years ago in a
major study of the police service. However, with expectations of
year 2000 computer problems, the police decided to put off the most
ambitious changes to their statistics systems, according to Chris
De Kock, director of the police crime information analysis center.
</P>
<P>
   Given the new commissioner's emphasis on tackling crime in the
most vulnerable communities, De Kock said, upgrading the system has
become a priority. ``You need to work with very accurate data,'' he
added, particularly on the location of crimes. ``Unfortunately, the
systems of the South African Police Service, where we derive our
statistics from, were never geared for that.''
</P>
<P>
   When the system has been fixed, he said, he does not expect huge
changes in crime totals, but he does expect a more accurate picture
of where, when and why the crimes are occurring.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our murders are not suddenly going to go from 20,000 to
10,000,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Nor does Gibson expect such dramatic changes in the figures. But
he said what he did anticipate was disturbing nonetheless.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not saying that they are going to provide false figures,''
he said, ``but I do say that I suspect that they want to apply some
spin, and they want to manage the news, and I think that's a
mistake in a democracy. In democratic countries the voters and the
public are entitled to know what's going on.''

`DROWNING RUTH': RIVALRY AND MEMORIES OF A SPOOKY DEATH 
</HEADLINE>
   (Eds: Publication notes appear at end of review.)  
 By JANET MASLIN    
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   An eerie, watery death is at the heart of ``Drowning Ruth,'' and
the only reliable witness was 3 years old when it happened. What's
more, Ruth Neumann's memory of the event seems to have played some
strange tricks. Ruth remembers the night her mother, Mathilda, fell
through the ice on a frozen lake, and she knows her mother drowned
there. But she also clings to the peculiar thought that somehow,
she herself drowned, too.
</P>
<P>
   Christina Schwarz, the author of this suspenseful, unusually
well-crafted first novel, cleverly contrasts Ruth's impressions
with those of her aunt, Amanda Starkey, whose recollections are
darker. On the night in 1919 when her sister died, not long after
their mother and father succumbed to influenza, Amanda wound up
with a bite mark on one hand, and the book creates a sinister sense
of how it got there. ``Who would have thought she would struggle so
fiercely?'' Amanda later thinks to herself. ``I found my father's
whiskey and dabbed a little on my wounds. Then I drank a glass.
People said it made you forget.''
</P>
<P>
   It's clear from the start, in a book that intersperses Amanda's
and Ruth's voices with a predominant third-person narrative, that
Schwarz can make a great deal out of the mystery of what really
happened. Sparingly and expertly, in a richly textured book with an
enveloping sense of the sisters' Wisconsin farm life, she doles out
the details. It develops that Carl Neumann, Mathilda's husband and
Ruth's father, was away in the Army when his wife died, and that he
must depend on Amanda for an explanation.
</P>
<P>
   It also develops that the strain of keeping a lid on her
emotions is enough to land Amanda in a psychiatric asylum soon
afterward. ``After all, it must have been hard for her,'' thinks
Clement Owens, a married man whose involvement with Amanda becomes
one of the book's most volatile ingredients. ``All those deaths,
the parents, then the sister. Anyone might crack.''
</P>
<P>
   Schwarz is able to deploy a line like that in casually chilling
fashion, so that the book stirs up powerful undercurrents of
foreboding. She fuses this suspense with such strong period detail
that ``Drowning Ruth'' creates a visceral sense of the forces that
constrain its women's lives. ``My mother's dresses smelled of
lavender water,'' Amanda recalls, with typical attention to
evocative particulars. ``She kept them perfectly, the sleeves and
bodices stuffed with paper to hold their shape, old shawls draped
over their shoulders to keep the dust off. It looked as if there
were six copies of my mother in the wardrobe, each without a
head.''
</P>
<P>
   No less frozen, in her own way, is Amanda, whose options in the
Wisconsin of 1919 are severely limited by her spinster status and
who clings desperately to her new role as Ruth's surrogate mother.
Throughout a book whose abundant plot twists would be spoiled by
too much discussion here, Amanda behaves in ways that make her
motherly side frighteningly apparent. She wants Ruth. She wants
Carl out of the way. Maybe she wanted her sister out of the way,
too. When Ruth grows up and becomes close to a girlfriend named
Imogene, her aunt's most agonizing maternal instincts are put to
the test.
</P>
<P>
   With deft pacing and a clear, vivid evocation of its principal
setting (the family farm and the isolated nearby island where
Mathilda drowned), Schwarz's homespun-sounding book has a
noticeably cinematic style. So Wes Craven, the ``Nightmare on Elm
Street'' director who showed a surprising flair for the womanly
aspects of ``Music of the Heart,'' is scheduled to bring it to the
screen, no doubt drawn to such frissons as the sudden sight of
Mathilda frozen in the lake, ``the blue eyes staring, the mouth
open, screaming without sound, trapped in that bottomless black
hole.''
</P>
<P>
   Other nicely horrific aspects include the book's hint of
reincarnation, its stirrings of a revenge plot and the mountingly
Gothic tone of Ruth's traumatic memories: ``Under the bed was where
to go the day the noises were scary. ... Under the bed is a good
place to hide when you hear the screaming, when you hear the
breathing, when you hear the `God, oh, God, oh, God.'''
</P>
<P>
   In the end, the real shock in ``Drowning Ruth'' is the
realization of how deeply its story of sisterly love and rivalry
supplants everything else. In an ambitious book that sees its
characters through to 1941, moving from suspense-tinged,
romantically rustic farm life (meals of bacon and turnips,
honeysuckle and black-eyed susan braided into wreaths, a local
cheesemaker having excellent luck with white cheddar) into the more
urbane lives of the next generation, the full meaning of Amanda and
Mathilda's final struggle is saved for the story's revelatory
ending. In this assured last stroke, Schwarz affirms the
psychological underpinnings of a book that would have worked
page-turningly well as a straightforward mystery alone. She gives
it the extra wisdom that marks ``Drowning Ruth'' as the chilling,
precociously good start to a bright new novelist's career.

 &HT;    
 &HT;    Q: I want to rent a machine for cleaning our living room carpet,
but a friend warned me these machines use water and a foaming
detergent which leave the carpet very damp.
 &HT;    As a result, when he replaced his coffee table and end tables,
the wood legs on each one formed dark stains on the carpet.
 &HT;    Is there a way to protect the carpet from such marks?
 &HT;    A: Most carpet cleaning machines do leave the carpet damp, but
this should dry up in a day or so _ faster if an air conditioner is
on or there is good ventilation in that room.
 &HT;    However, one precaution to take when reinstalling the furniture:
Place squares of plastic or aluminum foil under each wooden table
leg to prevent moisture in the carpet from drawing the stain out of
the wood.
 &HT;    This is probably what happened in your friend's case.
 &HT;    
 &HT;    Q: I built a small office room onto my house, with a single door
connecting it to the family room.
 &HT;    But even with the door closed, anyone in that room can hear me
talking on the phone or to clients in that office _ which makes it
difficult to maintain confidence with my clients.
 &HT;    What I can do to better insulate the door connecting the two
rooms so that sound won't pass through so easily?
 &HT;    A: Most interior doors are not much of a sound barrier because
they are either hollow or made with a single thin panel of wood set
into a frame.
 &HT;    A thick, solid door would do a better job of stopping sound
transmission, so you might want to try installing this type of door
in place of the one now in place.
 &HT;    In addition, it's a good idea to install foam type weather
stripping around all the edges of the door, including the top and
bottom, in order to further cut down on sound transmission.
 &HT;    The best method, however, is to install a second door in the
same frame so there are two doors blocking the entrance, one
opening in each direction.
 &HT;    When both doors are closed there will be a dead air space
trapped between them, and this will provide the best sound
insulation of all.
 &HT;    
 &HT;    Q: We have a storm window on the outside of our large picture
window and in cold weather, condensation covers the inside of this
storm window.
 &HT;    All putty has been replaced on both windows and all new weather
stripping was installed around the window.
 &HT;    What else can we do to solve this problem?
 &HT;    A: When condensation forms on the inside of the storm window it
means that warm moist air must be getting trapped in the space
between the two windows.
 &HT;    If you are certain that the weather stripping is good and
there's none missing, chances are you can cure the problem by
drilling a few one-quarter-inch ``weep holes'' along the bottom of
the storm window.
 &HT;    These holes will allow trapped moisture vapor to escape
harmlessly to the outside instead of condensing on the cold glass
of the storm window.
 &HT;    
 &HT;    Q: We have a constant problem with algae growing on our stone
patio, even though it slopes properly so that water drains off
after it rains.
 &HT;    I know that algae can be removed with bleach, but I am afraid
this will kill the plants and ground cover around the patio.
 &HT;    A commercial algaecide that I tried last year did work, but the
moss has come back.
 &HT;    Can you suggest a more permanent solution?
 &HT;    A: Moss only grows where there is moisture and a lack of
sunlight, so prune any trees or large shrubs that are shading that
patio from sunlight.
 &HT;    Also, try to improve drainage from the surface of the patio, as
well as from the ground around it.
 &HT;    Additionally, you may want to apply a clear masonry sealer to
the patio. That will help shed water and thus prevent it from
soaking in and keeping the patio damp.
 &HT;    
 &HT;    Questions about home-repair problems should be addressed to
Bernard Gladstone, care of The New York Times Syndication Sales
Corp., 122 E. 42nd St., New York, N.Y. 10168. Questions of general
interest will be answered in this column; Mr. Gladstone regrets
that unpublished letters cannot be answered individually.
 &HT;    
 &HT;    NOTE: Drawing captioned ``PROTECTING NEWLY WASHED CARPET'' goes
with this column.
 &HT;    CAPTION: Squares of plastic or aluminum foil under each table
leg will keep damp carpet from drawing stain out of wood.

A MESSAGE TO WEB DESIGNERS: IF IT AIN'T BROKE, DON'T FIX IT 
</HEADLINE>
   By JEFFREY SELINGO   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   When Salon.com revamped its Web site in May, readers greeted it
with hundreds of e-mail complaints. They criticized the horizontal
scrolling, the small type and the headlines that no longer linked
directly to articles.
</P>
<P>
   Within days, Salon's editor, David Talbot, posted a note to
readers saying, ``You win!'' and the site reverted to some of its
old design.
</P>
<P>
   The Salon revolt speaks volumes about the growing impatience
that Web users are having with constant face lifts of their
favorite sites or with sites that are difficult to navigate.
</P>
<P>
   In the early days of the Internet, users flocked to Web sites
with the latest gee-whiz technology, and other sites soon
replicated it. Some sites posted Web cameras even if they had
nothing to show; others experimented with animation, even if it was
of a construction worker, to alert users that a page was not quite
ready.
</P>
<P>
   Today, the Web ``is much less fashion driven,'' said Jakob
Nielsen, a Web-usability consultant at the Nielsen Norman Group, a
consulting firm in Mountain View, Calif.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the early days, users embraced change because the Internet
wasn't useful,'' Nielsen said. ``Now they punish change because
they need the Web. It's a useful tool.''
</P>
<P>
   As a result, users expect more of the Internet than simply
entertainment. And they easily become frustrated with sites that
don't deliver the goods.
</P>
<P>
   Alycia Eck is using the Internet to look for a used car. Unable
to browse the car lots on her own, Eck searches for pictures on the
Web but has found that most Web sites warn that the picture she
sees may not be of the actual car. And her e-mail to lenders goes
unanswered.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought it would be like that Saturn commercial where the
kid orders a pizza one day from his dorm room and the next day he
orders a car,'' Eck said. ``They haven't taken the time on their
Web sites to get me to come in and see the car.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, for the most part, consumers don't trust Web sites to
give them the information they need. A common debate among site
designers is how much information to put on the home page. Is it
easier to scroll down a front page with possibly hundreds of links
or to click through several pages?
</P>
<P>
   Popular home pages are now a mix of a directory and a search
engine. The growing consensus is that users want ``the broad and
shallow,'' said Louis Rosenfeld, president of Argus Associates, an
Ann Arbor, Mich., consulting firm that specializes in organizing
Web sites, a field known as information architecture.
</P>
<P>
   ``People don't trust that if the site makes choices for them on
the main page, that those would be the ones they would go by if
they were clicking through,'' Rosenfeld said. ``We're finding,
rather surprisingly, that they would rather a front page of 100
links.''
</P>
<P>
   As they did during the early days of the Internet, users still
demand speed. That will become more important, Web designers say,
as more users connect to the Internet through their mobile phones,
with their small screens and sometimes unreliable service.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, the needs of users are becoming more
sophisticated. Designers say that customization and anonymity are
the two things users want most right now. For example, consumers
favor features like My Yahoo and Amazon.com's Recommended lists. So
companies are looking for ways to customize their sites for users,
but without the usual annoyances, like passwords. Consumers are
reluctant to register for sites until the site proves useful,
Nielsen said. ``People don't want to buy into something unless they
know they're going to use it often,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The biggest complaint on message boards about Web designs is
information overload. Users on the message boards say that
companies have concentrated too much on design and content and not
enough on how the information is structured.
</P>
<P>
   For the most part, users say, search engines on sites are
unreliable. Either the search results yield too many choices, with
useless ones at top, or some sites have employed broad-based search
engines, like Google, that traverse the whole Web instead of just
the particular site. In the end, Nielsen said, users want a site
that is designed to help them find what they want, not what the
marketing department wants to promote.
</P>
<P>
   A few weeks ago, a woman was trying to describe to a friend
bedding she had seen in a Garnet Hill catalog. So the woman, Denise
Russo, decided to try the company's Web site. She had even planned
to place an order, but she said she had to ``click through what
seemed like 700 pages to get the picture I was looking for, and
then it was too small and I couldn't enlarge it.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The whole experience was way too annoying,'' Russo added.
``I'm never going back there.''
</P>
<P>
   Unlike magazine or book editors, site designers are hampered by
a lack of commonly agreed upon conventions on the Web. Some
similarities in Web designs are emerging. For example, nearly every
publicly held company has an investor-relations area on its Web
site where users can quickly find the latest press releases, annual
report and stock information. But Rosenfeld said he doubted that
Web users would ever see similarities on the Web like the chapters
and indexes they find in books.
</P>
<P>
   ``A book is a self-contained information space, and it's
finite,'' Rosenfeld said. ``A Web site could be designed in any way
the human mind could imagine.''
</P>
<P>
   At least 90 percent of Web sites need to be redesigned in some
way, said Nielsen, the Web usability consultant. But most Web
sites, he added, are not redesigned for the right reasons. In the
early days of the Internet, sites were redesigned every few months
to take advantage of the latest technology. Now a site may be
changed simply because a designer is bored with it or because a
company executive had a problem with it. Few companies test their
sites with users, Nielsen said, or if they do, they ignore the
advice.
</P>
<P>
   Nielsen suggests subtle redesigns and encourages companies to
explain how to perform old functions on the new site. For example,
when eBay revamped its auto auction site in April, canceling some
of its previous auction categories, it touched off a spate of
complaints from users who had listed their items during the switch.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is the worst mistake that eBay has made,'' a customer
wrote on the site's message board. ``I hope that someone at eBay
has the foresight to listen to its sellers and buyers and change it
back.'' The company later made changes.
</P>
<P>
   At Salon, the editors say that 90 percent of the redesigned site
is still intact, including a new color scheme, a navigation bar
across the top of the page, a switch to four columns from three and
a search box on every page. And Salon editors say the backlash will
not discourage them from redesigning again in a year or two.
</P>
<P>
   ``People have an understandable and justifiable preference for
what they're accustomed to,'' said Scott Rosenberg, vice president
of site development and managing editor of Salon. ``They don't want
to be bothered to learn new ways of doing things _ and unless you
can make clear to them that a new way is superior to the old,
familiar way, why should they?''

 &HT;    ONLINE BROADCASTS ADD NEW DIMENSION TO POLITICS
 &HT;    500&AMP;add.

<P>
   PHILADELPHIA _ Thanks to the Internet, television viewers
enraged by pontificating politicians can vent their frustration by
talking back live.
</P>
<P>
   The cutting-edge technology is getting a heavy-duty workout at
the Republican National Convention. For the first time, online
broadcasters have built their own electronic nests alongside the
major networks and cable outlets.
</P>
<P>
   The long-anticipated world of interactive political TV became a
reality the other night when Gov. Tom Ridge of Pennsylvania came to
Skybox 33 overlooking the First Union Center floor, the working
quarters of pseudopolitics.com.
</P>
<P>
   As Ridge explained his belief that abortion should be kept
legal, viewers challenged his views by sending Internet messages to
a chat room directly below the site's streaming video interview.
</P>
<P>
   ``The governor was able to enter into a serious dialogue with
his critics,'' said Jeanne Meyer, the Web site's senior vice
president. ``It was really cool. There's no way we could have done
something like this two years ago.''
</P>
<P>
   Pseudopolitics' rise to the rafters here offers a clear sign
that Web-based news operations are muscling their way into the news
coverage mainstream even before their technology is perfected.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to offering online interviews from its $20,000
leased skybox, the Web site pumps out Webcam pictures from six
positions in the converted sports arena, each of which provide
360-degree views.
</P>
<P>
   As these broadcasts unfold in cyberspace, viewers are invited to
e-mail messages to an ``EJ'' _ a kind of electronic disk jockey _
who puts them on the screen.
</P>
<P>
   The youthful EJs sit overlooking the convention floor in what
could pass for a standard TV convention setup. One difference is
the red sign lit up behind them with the words ``ON THE NET''
instead of ``ON THE AIR.''
</P>
<P>
   Said Gersh Kuntzman, the site's editorial director and a former
newspaper editor: ``Newspapers aren't going to be replaced. TV
won't be replaced. But we're going to have a role to play.''
</P>
<P>
   To mark the changing scene, pseudopolitics.com invited to its
skybox Robert Trout, whose long career at CBS radio and television
began before Franklin Roosevelt's first term and who covered his
first national political convention in 1936.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's now in his early 90s, but be performed online as the star
he once was,'' Meyer said.
</P>
<P>
   Still, even on computers with fast links to the Internet, the
live video streams of Ridge and Trout, hardly larger than postage
stamps, often arrived as fuzzy and jerky images.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not quite there yet,'' conceded Kathy Bushkin, senior
vice president and chief communications officer of America Online,
pseudopolitics' next-door neighbor on Skybox Row. AOL sees its
operation here as a precursor to its plans to couple traditional TV
audiences with its online services.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm sure,'' Bushkin added, ``that one day video streaming that
anyone can watch easily on the Internet will be a reality.''
</P>
<P>
   Said Meyer: ``It's a bit like watching the first guy who walked
on the moon.''
</P>
<P>
   (Story can end here. Optional add follows.)
</P>
<P>
   The two pioneering Internet-based skyboxes have set up shop on
the Center's exclusive suite level. They operate at the far flanks
of much larger glassed-in units that house both the
well-established TV outlets and the plush invitation-only alcoves
that cater to the biggest Republican givers.
</P>
<P>
   With the TV networks scaling back on their convention effort
this year, AOL and pseudopolitics.com hope to seize an opportunity
to fill in the coverage gap.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our aim is to puncture conventional wisdom and inject fun,
intelligence and voter participation back into politics,'' said
David Bohrman, chief executive of Pseudo Programs Inc., the
political site's parent company.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our approach to convention coverage this year will be a
powerful illustration of the next-generation medium we are
creating. Pseudo's production team will be pushing the limits of
technology,'' he said.

INTRODUCING `EDUCATION MARKET' IN NEW ZEALAND HAD UNINTENDED
CONSEQUENCES 
</HEADLINE>
  (EDS.: For release Sunday, Aug. 6) 
 By EDWARD B. FISKE and HELEN F. LADD   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
 Edward B. Fiske, an education consultant and a former education
editor of The New York Times, and his wife, Helen F. Ladd,
professor of public policy studies and economics at Duke
University, spent five months in New Zealand studying its school
reforms in 1998 and visited the country again recently. They are
the authors of ``When Schools Compete: A Cautionary Tale''
(Brookings Institution Press, 2000).  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WELLINGTON, New Zealand _ When Trevor Mallard became New
Zealand's Minister of Education several months ago, one of his
first steps was to bolster direct government assistance to troubled
urban schools.
</P>
<P>
   Although the programs he announced were hardly unusual _ more
money for early-childhood education, clustering of schools with
common problems, a bigger national investment in teacher training _
they were notable far beyond this island nation. The reason: they
signaled the end of a decade-long flirtation with the notion that
parental choice and competition among schools would, in and of
themselves, improve the educational offerings of troubled urban
schools.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're definitely moving away from the nonintervention
approach,'' Mallard said in a recent interview in his office here.
``Our goal is to close gaps between rich and poor schools, not
widen them.''
</P>
<P>
   For the last 10 years, New Zealand has provided a laboratory for
many of the educational theories that have become increasingly
popular among would-be reformers in the United States in recent
years, most notably charter schools and vouchers.
</P>
<P>
   With a population of 3.8 million, New Zealand is roughly
comparable to an American state, and its Ministry of Education is
the functional equivalent of a state department of education in the
decentralized American system. It has social, cultural and
political traditions similar to those in the United States and,
perhaps most important, a significant minority population.
</P>
<P>
   Those minorities, Maori and Pacific Islanders, many of whom live
in urban areas, make up 20 percent of the population, and schools
affirm their cultures, both through the formal curriculum and
through extracurricular activities and festivals.
</P>
<P>
   As in the United States, success in school correlates closely
with socioeconomic status. Large numbers of Maori and Pacific
Island pupils come from low-income families, and their collective
achievement levels are well below those of white students. At high
schools _ which are called colleges _ administrators have taken
steps to deal with such obstacles to learning as iron deficiency,
high cholesterol rates and family violence. For example, they have
created a health clinic at Tamaki College in South Auckland.
</P>
<P>
   In 1989, New Zealand embarked on what is arguably the most
radical overhaul of a state education system ever taken by an
industrialized country. The first step was taken by a Labor
government that abolished the country's heavy-handed central
educational bureaucracy and turned the running of all primary and
secondary schools over to locally elected boards of trustees
dominated by parents.
</P>
<P>
   Two years later, in 1991, a new national government committed to
free-market principles added to the reform mix by giving parents
the right to choose which school their children would attend.
Schools that attracted more applicants than they could accommodate
had considerable discretion over which ones to accept.
</P>
<P>
   Under the package of reforms, known collectively as Tomorrow's
Schools, the central Ministry of Education continues to fund
schools, draft national curriculum guidelines and operate an
accountability system under which teams from an independent
Education Review Office visit schools.
</P>
<P>
   Many school reformers in the United States and other developed
countries see governance changes like those adopted in New Zealand
as a key to improving the quality of public schools, including
those serving disadvantaged students. The core argument is that if
schools are freed from bureaucratic controls and forced to compete
for students, they will have both the means and the incentives to
become successful.
</P>
<P>
   Since New Zealand has no national standardized tests, it is not
possible to measure the impact of Tomorrow's Schools on student
achievement. Nevertheless, it is evident that self-governance and
parental choice were generally popular and that they had an
energizing effect on many primary and secondary schools, at least
those in middle- and upper-middle-income communities.
</P>
<P>
   The Gladstone Primary School in Auckland, for example, has
prospered by offering a program organized around the theory of
multiple intelligences articulated by Howard Gardner, a Harvard
University psychologist.
</P>
<P>
   ``No one is restricting us,'' said Colin Dale, the principal.
``The potential is now there to do whatever you want. It's all
about meeting needs and performing. If you get it right, people
will flock to you.''
</P>
<P>
   On the negative side, however, the educational marketplace has
polarized enrollment patterns by ethnicity and seriously
complicated the problems of schools serving large disadvantaged
populations.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Research shows that New Zealand parents of all races judge the
quality of schools in part by the ethnic mix of their students.
Schools with a preponderance of European students are seen as
superior to those with large numbers of Maori and Pacific
Islanders. In the new educational marketplace during the 1990s,
student transfers caused schools that had served predominantly
white students to grow in size, while those that served large
numbers of minorities saw their rolls decrease.
</P>
<P>
   Data from the Ministry of Education show, for example, that here
in Wellington the proportion of Maori and Pacific Island students
in primary and intermediate schools who ranked lowest in
socioeconomic status increased to 84 percent from 76 percent
between 1991 and 1996. A recent study by the government-supported
New Zealand Council for Educational Research also reported that the
intended reforms ``appear to have acted in an unintended manner,
which has increased ethnic polarization.''
</P>
<P>
   Not surprisingly, competition has produced both winners and
losers. Popular schools have been able to fill their rolls with
students from family backgrounds conducive to academic success,
while undersubscribed schools, which by law must accept all comers,
must now cope with greater concentrations of difficult-to-teach
students _ those from impoverished homes, with weak English skills
or with learning problems. Ministry data show that suspended
students are likely to end up in a school with a higher
concentration of poor and minority group students than the school
from which they were suspended.
</P>
<P>
   By the mid-1990s New Zealanders had come to speak of downwardly
``spiraling'' schools in which declining enrollments and the
subsequent loss of teachers and other academic resources compound
the challenges they face. A student at one such high school in
Auckland, Tangaroa College, said that she dreamed of going into
medicine but feared that she would not be adequately prepared.
</P>
<P>
   ``At our school, dreams seem so far away,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Market theory holds that if schools lose the capacity to attract
a sufficient number of students, they will close their doors and
other schools will come along to serve their students. But that
shift rarely occurred in New Zealand, partly because it is
politically difficult to close a school and partly because there
were few incentives for educational entrepreneurs to move into
unpromising situations.
</P>
<P>
   Faced with mounting political pressure to rescue troubled urban
schools, the national government began in the late 1990s to look
for ways to assist them. Policy makers did so reluctantly, however,
knowing that under the theory of the educational marketplace, there
was no justification for direct intervention.
</P>
<P>
   Initial efforts centered on improving the management skills of
principals in troubled schools. It soon became evident, though,
that while good management was important, it was not sufficient in
and of itself to turn around spiraling schools.
</P>
<P>
   ``With the benefit of hindsight, there was far too much optimism
about what managerial reform could accomplish,'' said Howard Fancy,
a civil servant who was secretary of education under the national
government and continues in that post in the Labor-led coalition
government that was sworn in last December.
</P>
<P>
   The ministry then initiated a School Improvement Project aimed
at assisting struggling schools through means that included
substantial direct investment. A plan for Hilary College, a high
school in Auckland, provided the equivalent of approximately $1
million for such purposes as buying out ``underperforming'' staff
members, an anti-violence program, counseling services and new
equipment. A similar plan for nearby Tangaroa College provided
funds for staff buyouts, new equipment and support of a guidance
clinic, a nurse, a truancy officer and a part-time sports
coordinator.
</P>
<P>
   The new government has vowed to strengthen the School
Improvement Project. Eighteen primary, intermediate and secondary
schools in a low-income and immigrant section of Auckland have now
formed a coalition to address common problems, and leaders say they
are ready to try new approaches.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have to think long and hard about pedagogy,'' said Terry
Bates, director of a new project linking schools in Auckland. ``The
teaching methods that we developed after World War II are not
suitable for inner-city kids who have all kinds of interruptions in
their lives that do not hinder middle-class kids. We need to
provide more one-on-one instruction. We need to find ways of using
technology in ways that allow pupils to take greater control of
their own learning. We need to train teachers to be enablers of
learning rather than sources of information.''
</P>
<P>
   The new government has taken other steps to address what it
views as some of the excesses of the Tomorrow's Schools reforms. In
an effort to rein in the ability of popular schools to cherry-pick
easy-to-teach students, new legislation requires schools that have
more applicants than they can handle to hold a lottery to determine
who can enroll.
</P>
<P>
   Fancy, the education secretary, pointed out that while
Tomorrow's Schools had exacerbated the problems of some urban
schools, many of those schools were failing well before 1989. In
highlighting the negative impact of a competitive environment on
troubled schools, he suggested, the reforms had the effect of
drawing public attention to their needs.
</P>
<P>
   ``Tomorrow's Schools has sharpened our focus on educational
failure,'' he said. ``Only now, 10 years into the reforms, are we
seeing a serious effort to turn schools around.''

 &HT;    (EDs: A brief roundup of the day's campaign events, pulled from
Cox staff and wire reports.)
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   George W. Bush, voicing confidence that ``you're looking at the
next president of the United States,'' arrived in Philadelphia
today to formally accept his party's presidential nomination. After
a warm-up tour through six states and two brief appearances by
satellite, the Texas governor's first stop was a Hispanic rally
where he alternated between English and Spanish as he told a crowd
of more than 1,000,
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a better day for America; there's a better day for
all. . . . Together we can make sure every child can read in
America.'' Bush will be officially nominated for president at the
Republican National Convention tonight, but the stage will then
belong to his vice presidential running mate, Dick Cheney, who _ in
his first major appearance as Bush's pick _ will ``draw some
contrasts'' with Vice President Al Gore in his speech, according to
a campaign spokesman. For Bush, the finale will be on Thursday when
he accepts the nomination in the most important speech of his life.
</P>
<P>
   FORD `DOING WELL' AFTER STROKE
</P>
<P>
   Former President Gerald Ford suffered a stroke while attending
the convention, but was described by doctors as ``doing well''
today and thinking clearly. The 87-year-old Ford had a small stroke
that affected the base of his brain, causing him some trouble with
his balance and his speech, but he seemed to be understanding
everything. He is expected to stay in the hospital for five or six
days. Ford went to the hospital after last night's convention
session and was released within a half-hour with what doctors said
at the time was an acute sinus infection. But he returned to the
hospital this morning. ``I think he probably had a stroke maybe two
days ago and had another little one'' overnight, said Dr. Robert
Schwartzman, chief of neurology at Hahnemann University Hospital.
The doctor said the stroke was not detected earlier because ``it
looks like an ear infection.''
</P>
<P>
   STIRRING IT UP AT THE REPUBLICAN LOVEFEST
</P>
<P>
   About 120 demonstrators peacefully protested George W. Bush's
record on Latino issues outside the Philadelphia Museum of Art
today, where Bush was addressing a Hispanic audience. A few blocks
away, 40 demonstrators denouncing the death penalty and calling
attention to other issues chanted and waved banners at an entrance
to a downtown arena where Bush was arriving for a fund-raiser. The
demonstrations today have so far contrasted sharply with the angry
brawls with police a day earlier. Protesters slashed tires on
police vehicles, dumped orange paint on some and spray-painted
graffiti denouncing the death penalty and police. Police responded
with batons after being hit by protesters, leaving several
demonstrators bleeding. Some demonstrators were upset about the
more- confrontational behavior. Said Patricia Maxey, a 16-year-old
member of New Yorkers Against the Death Penalty: ``If it gets like
this again, I'm going home. I don't want to be beaten up because
some idiot in a mask wants to get on television. I came here to
talk about injustice.''
</P>
<P>
   HAVING HIS CAKE AND EATING IT TOO
</P>
<P>
   On the day Dick Cheney is set to formally introduce himself to
the world as George W. Bush's vice presidential nominee, the Texas
governor kept introducing John McCain. At a rally today, Bush
called McCain's address the night before ``a touching tribute to
America.'' That cued McCain's surprise stroll onstage, where Bush
wrapped him in a hug and whispered something in his ear. At a $10
million fund-raiser _ an event boycotted by the reform-minded
McCain _ Bush blessed his former rival. With Cheney off stage and
out of site, the Texan declared, ``I can't wait to campaign with
John McCain. Together we can win this election!'' Bush, who lost
seven primaries to the Arizona senator last winter, knows better
than most about McCain's appeal to independent voters. But when it
came time to fill out his ticket, the Texan selected loyalty over
political potency _ giving off the impression that he's trying to
have it both ways.
</P>
<P>
   TAX CUTS? EXIT STAGE LEFT
</P>
<P>
   Tax cuts have always been central to the GOP's agendum but in
the party's drive to broaden its appeal, little was said from the
podium about the subject during the convention's first two days.
This, despite the rush by Republicans in Congress to pass bills
beforehand to eliminate the tax penalty on marriage, repeal
inheritance taxes and cut taxes on Social Security benefits.
Indeed, the only GOP political figures to dwell at length on tax
cuts during the first two days of the convention were the 29
congressional candidates who spoke during Monday's little-noticed
afternoon session. The Republicans will, however, deliver a
tax-cutting message tonight, but in a soft-focus way: a single mom,
a computer company president and a family farmer will join Virginia
Gov. Jim Gilmore in helping describe the GOP's tax relief vision.
</P>
<P>
   THE WHOLE WORLD IS WATCHING _ SOMETHING ELSE
</P>
<P>
   Television ratings for the first night of the convention
indicated that only a small fraction of the total television
audience watched the prime-time portion of the event. On ABC and
CBS, the two networks that offered just an hour of prime-time
coverage each, only about 13 million, or 15 percent of the total
television audience, tuned in. The coverage on both networks was
beaten by a repeat episode of the show ``Third Watch'' on NBC.
</P>
<P>
   MARYLAND HIS MARYLAND
</P>
<P>
   Maryland saved the day for Wyoming and the Republicans during
the introduction of Dick Cheney at the convention. When Cheney and
his wife, Lynne, arrived at the floor, the Wyoming section on the
floor was empty _ just a few folks in the seats. Knowing the
cameras would pan to the delegation right after Cheney was
introduced, someone drafted part of Maryland's delegation to sit in
those empty seats, said Audrey E. Scott, a member of the Prince
George's County Council who has played head cheerleader for her
state's delegation. ``He's pointing to us like we're his best
friends, and we're waving and pointing back,'' she said today. As
luck would have it, Republicans couldn't have wished for a better
surrogate delegation: Marylanders have been among the most vocal,
enthusiastic of any of the delegations.
</P>
<P>
   RNC BODY-SLAMMED, SOME WANT WRESTLER TOSSED OUT
</P>
<P>
   A small band of incensed conservatives has put Republican
officials in a headlock over their inclusion of professional
wrestler The Rock in tonight's program. The Parents Television
Council is protesting the Rock's appearance because they ``object
to the violent and raunchy nature'' of the World Wrestling
Federation's programming. ``By giving `The Rock' such a prominent
role at the convention, the GOP is, in effect, saying that the
values of the WWF _ violence, profanity, graphic sexuality, the
demeaning of women, and the promotion of racial stereotypes _ are
shared by the party,'' said PTC chair Brent Bozell. Rep. J.D.
Hayworth (D-Ariz.) responded, ``As a social conservative . . . let
me say with all candor and proper respect, lighten up. This is a
convention. It's supposed to be fun.''
</P>
<P>
   FORGET ABOUT THE ROCK, HOW ABOUT THE BODY?
</P>
<P>
   The buzz around certain circles at the convention today is that
Minnesota Gov. Jesse Ventura will endorse George W. Bush for
president, according to the Washington Times. Ventura could not be
reached for comment, and officials in the Bush campaign did not
return telephone calls seeking comment. If true, a Ventura
endorsement would effectively eliminate a potential last-minute
White House run by the popular maverick politician who has proven
himself a capable governor. It would also be a departure from views
the former professional wrestler expressed a few weeks ago when he
said both Al Gore and Bush were ``too rehearsed'' and ``too spun''
to capture the independent vote, which he could easily garner.
</P>
<P>
   SPEAKING OF R.O.C.K
</P>
<P>
   Rocker John Mellencamp's ``staying mum'' on George W. Bush's
liberal use of his song ``R.O.C.K. in the U.S.A.'' on the campaign
trail. Bush has been playing the song on his pre-convention tour.
He also used the tune when he announced Dick Cheney as his running
mate. Mellencamp's ``R.O.C.K.'' hasn't reached the status of
Fleetwood Mac's ``Don't Stop Thinking About Tomorrow'' from
Clinton-Gore '92 as an official campaign song for Bush, but it's
been played enough to strike a chord at rallies. ``While Mellencamp
isn't a Bush supporter, he won't comment on the matter unless it
becomes used in a more prominent way,'' said the New York Post,
reporting on the story. Right now, it's only the first song of a
tape that also includes music by Gloria Estefan and John Fogerty.
Mellencamp's been in this position before, refusing to give
permission to Ronald Reagan who wanted to use his ``Pink Houses.''
Four years ago, Bob Dole angered Bruce Springsteen after Dole used
``Born in the U.S.A.''
</P>
<P>
   THE SINCEREST FORM OF FLATTERY?
</P>
<P>
   The Children's Defense Fund, a Washington think tank, is
considering suing the Republican Party for using its trademarked
slogan,''Leave no child behind'' as the official theme of its
convention's opening night. ``They shouldn't hijack the phrase
without acting on behalf of children,'' said founder and president
Marian Wright Edelman. She said George W. Bush has yet to respond
to the think tank's complaints; Republicans said nobody has the
exclusive rights to helping kids.
</P>
<P>
   THE DEVIL IS IN THE DETAILS
</P>
<P>
   By all accounts, George W. Bush is not a detail man. In his
fourth month as governor of Texas, Bush pared the time generally
reserved for final review of each scheduled execution from 30
minutes to 15. And he never read the 261-page report on the Texas
A&AMP;M University bonfire collapse, nor did he read the 36-page
executive summary. ``I highlighted half a page; he read that,''
Clay Johnson, Bush's chief of staff, told the Los Angeles Times.
Daily appointment calendars obtained by the newspaper show that as
governor, Bush focused on a few issues, preferred short meetings
and insisted on a two-hour midday break centered on a rejuvenating
run. He had many more meetings on education than on any other
subject, and met frequently with representatives of oil, insurance
and other industries, but seldom with labor, environmental or
consumer activists. And nearly half the 469 business leaders,
energy executives and lobbyists who came through his doors donated
to his political campaigns.
</P>
<P>
   BREAKING UP IS HARD TO DO
</P>
<P>
   Delegate S.G. ``Vet'' Payne couldn't bring himself to back
George W. Bush at the convention. The Rhode Island retiree, a
fervent John McCain supporter, planned to abstain when his state
pledged itself to Bush in the roll call of states. Then, someone
tapped him on his shoulder and asked him to step to the back of the
convention hall. There stood John McCain's wife, Cindy, who asked
him to change his mind, saying her husband had urged his delegates
to support Bush ``I said, 'OK, I am a loyal McCain supporter. I
will at your very specific request change my position,''' Payne
said. The two hugged and went their separate ways. Another delegate
however went against McCain's wishes and cast the only McCain vote
of the convention. Dr. Dwight Stowell Jr., of the Massachusetts
delegation, said he wanted to send a message to Bush about the need
for campaign finance reform with his vote.
</P>
<P>
   BUSH CLAN GOES BALLISTIC
</P>
<P>
   Former president George Bush came to the defense of his son
today when he told a breakfast for farm groups that his son is
disciplined enough to ``stick to the message'' despite goading from
the opposition. ``He can dish it out if he has to, but he's going
to stay on his message. You don't believe me? Ask Ann Richards,''
the elder Bush said of George W. Bush. Richards is the Democrat
whom George W. Bush ousted from the Texas governor's office, and
who is remembered for deriding the elder Bush at the Democratic
convention in 1988 for being born with a silver foot in his mouth.
``Well, she may have been right about that, but anyway, they
cheered like hell and then George came along two years later and
showed her what she could do with that silver foot,'' the former
president said. The elder Bush was responding to an earlier comment
by President Clinton that the only reason the Texas governor was
running was because his ``daddy was president.'' If Clinton doesn't
back off, he said, the family might unleash ex-first lady Barbara
Bush. Indeed, the candidate's mother jumped in _ in comments on
ABC's ``Good Morning America,'' saying Al Gore would not be able to
return respect to the office her husband lost to Clinton in the
1992 election.
</P>
<P>
   RAGIN' CAJUN ALL THE RAGE
</P>
<P>
   When Democratic strategist James Carville, the most vociferous
and recognizable defender of the Clinton-Gore administration, shows
up on the convention floor, the man Republicans love to hate on the
political talk shows is treated like a rock star instead of being
scorned and jeered. ``I get more picture requests at the Republican
convention than at a Democratic convention,'' Carville marveled.
``I've had my picture taken with 150 delegates here,'' he said.
Carville has been invited to the convention by NBC News, which
broadcasts his political analysis from their skybox several times
each evening. The man who snuck onto the GOP convention floor in
1996 says he has ``gone legit'' this time around.
</P>
<P>
   AT LEAST THE DIDN'T SAY IT WAS IN THE MAIL
</P>
<P>
   There's been a lot of talk about campaign contributions floating
around at the convention. At least one was just lying on the ground
waiting to be picked up. Two reporters for the Philadelphia
Inquirer happened upon a $5,000 check for New York Rep. John
McHugh's re-election campaign that was sticking out from under a
motorized cart outside the convention center. The check was from
Advo Inc., a direct-mail company based in Windsor, Conn., which
gives regularly to McHugh, who chairs the House Government Reform
subcommittee on the Postal Service. McHugh told the newspaper he
had met with Advo representatives in a hotel bar, but they couldn't
find the check they had meant to give him. ``They said they just
couldn't find it. I don't think they knew where it was,'' McHugh
said. The Inquirer returned the check.

CRITIC'S NOTEBOOK: ANARCHISTS OF THE WORLD, UNITE IN YOUR LITERARY
ROOTS! 
</HEADLINE>
   By WALTER GOODMAN   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The appearance of some self-proclaimed anarchists among the
protesters at the Republican convention is tantalizing but
perplexing. With radical effusions so out of style, what are we to
make of these figures from beyond the fringe? They summon us back
to a time and place when anarchists were taken seriously, Russia in
the 19th century, and to the great novelists who grappled with the
phenomenon.
</P>
<P>
   As the eruptions on the streets of Seattle and Washington
demonstrated a few months ago, any organization that calls itself
the World Bank or the International Monetary Fund is a natural
target for a radical's abiding animosity toward rich and powerful
institutions that impose their will on entire societies. But since
the anarchist by definition opposes every sort of system, the word
has become identified more with wishful dreams of destroying what
exists than with workable schemes to achieve what ought to exist.
</P>
<P>
   In his 1964 history, ``The Anarchists,'' (Atlantic, Little
Brown), James Joll concluded that while anarchist doctrine draws on
political ideas of the Enlightenment, anarchist actions, which are
often meant to startle, can be explained ``only in terms of the
psychology of religious belief.''
</P>
<P>
   The confrontations, slogans, costumes (black garb enlivened by
red bandanas) of today's American-style street anarchists invite a
novelist's scrutiny of a temperament that had its most spectacular
heyday in 19th-century Russia yet pops up periodically even on
these relatively placid shores.
</P>
<P>
   In their literary incarnations anarchists range from murderers
to flower children. Dostoyevsky, the pre-eminent psychologist of
Russian radicalism, found inspiration for his novel ``The
Possessed,'' (renamed ``Demons'' by its latest translators, Richard
Pevear and Larissa Volokhonsky) in the 1869 murder of a student by
a group led by a 22-year-old nihilist, Sergei G. Nechayev. (My
dictionary reports that the anarchist believes that all political
institutions and existing social arrangements should be abolished;
the nihilist, a word that has gone out of fashion, calls for their
destruction by terrorism.) The Nechayev trial in 1871, the first
public political trial in Russia, supplied Dostoyevsky with many of
the characters and elements of his novel, published the following
year.
</P>
<P>
   Be they anarchists or nihilists, the radicals do not come off
very well in ``Demons.'' Shigalyov, the movement's theoretician in
the book, is candid about the dead end of anarchism: ``Starting
from unlimited freedom, I conclude with unlimited despotism.'' The
Nechayev-like character, Pyotr Verkhovensky, represents the
transformation of the ideal of unlimited freedom into anarchic
destruction.
</P>
<P>
   The translators sum up Dostoyevsky's take on his characters'
radicalism: ``Everything is inverted here: freedom ends in
despotism, adoration turns to hatred, lucidity increases blindness,
the first real act of the liberator of mankind _ Nechayev or
Verkhovensky _ is the murder of his human brother. Seeking the
greatest good, we do the greatest evil.''
</P>
<P>
   Although Dostoyevsky and his foremost competitor, Turgenev, had
little in common politically, they shared a mistrust and distaste
for the anarchic atrocities and fancies of their time.
</P>
<P>
   Turgenev provided an enduring specimen of what might be called
Anarchy Light in Bazarov, who came to personify nihilism, which had
a vogue in mid-19th-century Russia. Although Bazarov willingly
accepts being labeled a nihilist, he is far too disdainful of any
hope for improvement of any sort to become part of any movement.
</P>
<P>
   As he puts it in a running quarrel with Pavel Petrovich, the
older-generation liberal, ``At the present time the most useful
thing is negation.'' When pressed on what is to be done after the
destruction of ``everything,'' he says: ``That already goes beyond
our task. The first thing is to clear the field.''
</P>
<P>
   Call it anarchy or nihilism or just desperation, that is the
terrorism of the mind; the payoff is all internal. The politics of
Bazarov, by far the most dynamic character in ``Fathers and Sons''
(or ``Fathers and Children,'' as a newer translation has it), grows
out of his sense of his own intellectual superiority. Or, as some
psychologist would surely deduce, it is a shield for his
insecurity.
</P>
<P>
   Bazarov wins all the arguments with the elderly liberal, but
they are essentially rhetorical victories. He patronizes his loving
parents, mocks the ignorant peasantry and scorns almost everyone he
meets until, in a contrived ending for an otherwise glowingly
honest novel, Turgenev has him morally redeemed by love and death.
</P>
<P>
   Still, when it comes to probing the radicalism of his time,
Bazarov remains the enduring figure of the self-absorbed radical
whose bark is fierce but who has no bite, a specimen not absent
among radicals today. It is temperament, not ideology, that holds
him back from true anarchy. Although he is politically useless, his
heart, to borrow this campaign season's favorite organ, is good. At
least you would never find him donning a mask or breaking a window
in a demonstration.
</P>
<P>
   There seems to be something about the greatest novelists that is
put off by anarchism, whatever its form. In part it may be their
own politically conservative inclinations. More important perhaps,
for all their differences, writers like Dostoyevsky, Turgenev and
Conrad, who inspected the psyche of a bomb thrower in ``The Secret
Agent,'' share a need for intellectual organization, which is
threatened by ideological chaos. Moreover, they mistrust movements
that would force art and politics into utopian abstractions in the
name of an illusory freedom. They have history on their side and
might make for rewarding reading by today's theatrically inclined
protesters.

COMPUTERS HELP ADMISSIONS TESTS ADAPT TO STUDENT'S ANSWERS 
</HEADLINE>
   (Editors: A 300-word box of advice appears at end of 2nd take.)  
 (For release Sunday, August 6)  
 By LISA GUERNSEY   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   With virtually everything becoming electronic and digital, it
may be no surprise to discover that the hum of hard drives has
replaced the scent of freshly sharpened pencils for students taking
many of today's standardized admissions tests.
</P>
<P>
   But here is the catch: most computerized tests are not merely
onscreen versions of what appears in paper workbooks. Rather than
simply scanning in copies of multiple choice examinations, some
test makers have prepared adaptive tests, meaning that they are
designed to adapt, on the fly, to the ability of the person taking
the test.
</P>
<P>
   For example, those who take the Graduate Record Examination,
which is often required for admission to graduate schools, receive
one test question or item at a time. If they answer the first
question correctly, the computer serves them another question of
greater difficulty. If the answer to the first question is wrong,
the next question is easier. And so it goes throughout the exam.
The items on the screen at any time depend entirely on how the
previous question was answered. People who answer some right and
some wrong are led down a zigzag path: A wrong answer bumps them
down to an easier level, but a correct answer lifts them back to
more difficult ones.
</P>
<P>
   It is like zeroing in on a target, designers of the tests say.
Each answered question provides another tidbit of information about
the test taker's ability, enabling the computer to shift course
until it comes upon those questions that lie just between the ones
that are answered easily and the ones that stump.
</P>
<P>
   ``Toward the end of the test, you come to items that are most
difficult for you,'' said Howard Wainer, the author of
``Computerized Adaptive Testing: A Primer,'' the second edition of
which was published this spring. ``Those are the questions that are
at your ability.''
</P>
<P>
   The move to offer standardized tests on computers has brought
both criticism and kudos. Many students, being accustomed to doing
most of their schoolwork on computers, shrink at the notion of
completing anything on paper. What's more, many of the computerized
tests provide scores immediately after the last item is answered,
which the students like.
</P>
<P>
   Critics of standardized tests, who contend that both paper and
computerized tests are flawed in determining intellectual ability,
also argue that computerized exams put people who are not
accustomed to the technology at a disadvantage. Besides that, the
fee to take the digital tests is twice as much as for their paper
predecessors. .
</P>
<P>
   The adaptive format also raises questions about how test scores
can be fairly compared. Because the test items change as the test
is taken, two people taking what is officially the same test at the
same time are likely to answer completely different questions.
</P>
<P>
   Adding to the confusion, raw totals mean nothing. Two test
takers could get the same number of questions correct and yet come
up with widely varying scores. As Wainer explains, adaptive exams
are designed so that, in theory, everyone gets about half the
questions right. Highly proficient test takers will be given harder
questions and may get only half of them right, and the less
proficient will be given easier questions and may also correctly
answer 50 percent of them.
</P>
<P>
   The scores are derived by assigning different values to
different items, with greater weight given to difficult items than
easy ones. The weighting is generally not described to test takers,
because it involves complicated mathematics. So for people who have
grown up with traditional test scores based on raw totals (and who
will forever equate 50 percent with a failing grade), the concept
takes some getting used to.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is hard to explain how the scoring works,'' said Stephen T.
Schreiber, vice president of the Law School Admission Council,
``and that is one of the reasons why testing services have to be
careful when they go to computerized testing.''
</P>
<P>
   Test takers' confusion over both the scoring and the zigzag
pattern of adaptive testing has led many to adopt new strategies in
test taking, some of which test developers consider inadvisable.
</P>
<P>
   Consider the case of Ricken Patel, a graduate student in Harvard
University's public-policy program, who took the computerized
Graduate Record Examination last year. ``I was advised to
concentrate on the first few questions,'' he said. As he understood
it, if the first item were answered incorrectly, he would be led
down a path of easy items instead of hard ones.
</P>
<P>
   When he took the test, he ran out of time and guessed on the
last few answers. Still, he scored higher on the test than he had
expected, so he concluded that his strategy had worked.
</P>
<P>
   But officials at Educational Testing Service, the country's
largest developer of standardized tests, say that emphasizing the
first few questions is not, in fact, a smart way to approach the
tests.
</P>
<P>
   Wainer, a principal research scientist at Educational Testing,
groans when he hears of students who worry mostly about the first
few questions. ``To suggest that you should pay close attention to
the first 10 is correct,'' he said. ``But you should pay close
attention to the next 10, too.''
</P>
<P>
   A test taker should concentrate on each question throughout the
time period, according to Drew Gitomer, vice president of research
at Educational Testing Service. Suppose that a wrongly answered
item at the end causes an easier item to appear. If a test taker
were not concentrating by that point, thinking that the last few
items mattered little, she might answer one wrongly, then receive
an easier question and answer that wrongly too.
</P>
<P>
   ``Pacing yourself all along is very important,'' Gitomer said.
</P>
<P>
   Yet the misperception remains. Many students, when interviewed,
said they worried that if they messed up on the first few
questions, they would never be able to redeem themselves.
</P>
<P>
   Michele Rogers, assistant dean of admissions at Northwestern
University's Kellogg Graduate School of Management, said she
thought that test takers made that mistake because of another
aspect of the exams: most of them do not allow students to return
to questions they have already answered. ``People confuse the two
concepts,'' she said, ``and that compounds the problem.''
</P>
<P>
   (MORE) &QL; 
nn
</P>
<P>
   The testing service expects that some of the myths surrounding
the tests will dissipate as the tests become more mainstream. The
Graduate Record Examination, which was first administered via
computer in 1992, is now almost entirely computerized. So are
admission tests for students of nursing and dental schools, as well
as the Test of English as a Foreign Language. The Graduate
Management Admission Test, which is used by business schools, has
been offered only on computer since 1997.
</P>
<P>
   Other tests are still coming: The SAT is many years away from
being offered on computer, testing service officials say. The
agency first wants to make sure that all high school students are
at ease with computers, and it is waiting for a day in which it is
logistically possible to administer not just thousands but millions
of exams in computer centers throughout the world. The ACT
Assessment, which is a competitor of the SAT, is not yet offered on
computer for the same reasons.
</P>
<P>
   A few professional tests, notably the Law School Admission Test
and the Medical College Admission Test, are still administered on
paper, but officials for the tests expect that computerized
versions will replace them in the next decade.
</P>
<P>
   As computerized tests become the norm, the testing companies
must face the challenge of being sure that the results will be as
useful to admissions officers in evaluating applicants as paper
tests were in the past. Yet is it fair to compare a test taken on
paper, in a linear fashion, with one that uses the adaptive method?
</P>
<P>
   The question makes test developers squirm. They stress that they
have made sure that the same types of questions are asked in both
cases, and contend that adaptive tests are more efficient than
traditional paper tests in determining a person's ability. They
have conducted studies, they say, to show that comparisons can be
made fairly, given the right items and the right scoring systems.
</P>
<P>
   Gitomer, for example, calls the computerized tests ``more
precise.'' Even so, he added, ``It's not perfect _ measurement of
human abilities is not an exact science.'' That is why, he
continues, ``we advise people never to use the test score as the
only instrument'' in evaluating a person's qualifications.
</P>
<P>
   Even when comparisons are made between two tests in the adaptive
format, another question comes up: How can a person taking a test
with items X, Y and Z be compared to a person taking a test with
items A, B and C?
</P>
<P>
   In this case, test developers have history on their side: Such
comparisons have long been part of the process of standardized
testing. To squelch cheating on paper-and-pencil exams, test
administrators often give students versions that differ slightly
from the exams their peers took a month or a year ago.
</P>
<P>
   To ensure that scores are fair, test administrators employ a
statistical methodology called equating. It is based on the idea
that different test items may act as similar measures of ability.
Two different algebra equations, for example, may measure a certain
level of algebraic ability. Regardless of whether the questions
appear on paper or on screen, test developers say, items can be
equated to derive solid scores.
</P>
<P>
   Many admissions officers say that they have found both paper and
computerized tests to be equally helpful in indicating a student's
ability, if used along with other information like grade point
averages.
</P>
<P>
   Rogers of Kellogg said, ``We often didn't know the difference,''
in scores from paper and adaptive tests when both were used a few
years ago. Now many business schools do not even accept GMAT scores
from paper tests, because they are not recent enough.
</P>
<P>
   But business schools have noticed at least one difference: GMAT
scores have been rising in recent years. No studies have been done
to determine why, but admissions officers have theories. Maybe
students are doing better because they are more accustomed to
computers than paper. Maybe they perform better because the test is
now administered on a more flexible schedule. Maybe, because of the
roaring economy, business schools are attracting smarter applicants
than they once did.
</P>
<P>
   Whatever the reason, and regardless of whether scores are
climbing, graduate schools like the computerized tests for another
reason: because applicants can take the test at almost any time,
their scores arrive at admissions offices in a constant flow,
instead of in huge batches once or twice a year. Admissions
officers now have the luxury of reviewing scores on their own
schedule. ``We can make decisions at any time throughout the
season,'' said Rogers. ``From an operational standpoint, it's
wonderful.''
</P>
<P>
   ADVICE FROM EXPERTS
</P>
<P>
   What should test takers worry about when taking computerized
adaptive tests? A few elements of strategy are worth heeding,
developers and test preparation coaches say. For example, as Drew
Gitomer, vice president of research at the Educational Testing
Service, said, pace yourself.
</P>
<P>
   Do not attempt to skip questions. Every question must be
answered. Most computerized tests will not display a new item until
the previous one is answered. This also means that a person cannot
browse through the questions before answering them. ``You have to
just jump in,'' said Trent Anderson, vice president and publisher
of Kaplan Inc., a test preparation and educational services
company.
</P>
<P>
   Emily Buenting, a recent graduate of Simmons College's business
school, said she liked that aspect of the computerized GMAT when
she took it in 1998. ``I actually found it much better to take the
test on the computer,'' said Buenting, who had previously taken it
on paper. ``It forced me to be more organized, rather than always
skipping around.''
</P>
<P>
   Another difference is the flexible schedule that usually comes
with the administration of computerized adaptive tests. Instead of
offering the tests only twice a year in huge auditoriums on
Saturday mornings, ETS and other test administrators enable
students to schedule their own tests. They arrange to meet exam
proctors at local computer laboratories, typically run by a Thomson
Learning company called Prometric.
</P>
<P>
   The flexibility sounds great, but it can throw test takers for a
loop, Anderson of Kaplan said. He said he had seen more students
starting the test preparation process late since the advent of
computerized tests. ``The burden is on the individual to initiate
the process,'' he said. ``And that means you have to plan ahead.''

   NATIONAL FORECAST &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Showers and thunderstorms will drench parts of New York and New
England as a cold front pushes eastward into the Appalachians. A
flow of tropical air preceding the front will supply enough
moisture to cause flooding in some areas from central New York to
western Maine.
</P>
<P>
   High pressure near Bermuda will circulate very warm and humid
air from the Gulf of Mexico into the Southeast. Thundershowers will
blossom in the sultry air mass in the afternoon. The approach of a
cold front in the central Appalachians and Tennessee Valley will
lead to several potent storms.
</P>
<P>
   Refreshingly cooler, drier air will spread from the upper Great
Lakes into the Ohio Valley. A return flow of humid air into the
western Plains will cause a few thunderstorms. Torrid air over the
West will lead to thunderstorms each afternoon in the Rockies.
</P>
<P>
   FOCUS: COLD JULY
</P>
<P>
   What a difference a year makes, at least at Central Park. July
1999 was the warmest summer month ever for New York City, while
this past July was one of the coolest in nearly a century. For only
the second time since 1900, the mercury failed to reach 90 degrees
at Central Park in July. In Binghamton, N.Y., the temperature only
topped 80 on the last day of the month. Albany tied its coldest
July ever with records dating back into the middle 1800s. While the
jet stream has relaxed some this week, another batch of cool air
will arrive late this week in New York.

   Buy summer water toys now? You betcha. A good bit of summer
weather still stretches ahead of us like a heat mirage on a
four-lane highway.
</P>
<P>
   Besides, you can get great deals on water toys right now. Stores
_ especially the big discount stores _ are turning their attention
to layaway-till-Christmas prospects, so you can find entire aisles
of discounted water toys. What doesn't get used in the next month
or two can be stashed in the garage until next summer. And your
kids will be on very good behavior when they know you have a
plastic water cannon tucked away in the hall closet. (Of course,
smart parents would never give up the location of their toy stash
... even under threat of water-toy torture.)
</P>
<P>
   Here are five of our favorite backyard water toys, for all
swimsuit sizes, no swimming pool required:
</P>
<P>
   1. Super Soaker Big Trouble by Larami: Your child has probably
whined for this one: a water gun with a backpack reservoir for
extended water battles that promises ``fast refills and super
firepower.'' Kid testers for Zillions, Consumer Reports for Kids,
gave it an ``excellent'' rating but noted that the 8-pound pack can
get too heavy for smaller kids. Our 7-year-old tester, 50 pounds
soaking wet, had no such trouble, wreaking a lot of havoc on his
older sisters. Suggested retail price: $30 (but we scored one at
Wal-Mart last week for $19.95).
</P>
<P>
   2. Super Soaker Splashketball by Playskool: Basketball with
splashy rewards; cyber toy store etoys.com recommends this backyard
game for kiddos ages 3 to 6, but older kids certainly can work on
their hand-eye coordination and have just as much fun getting wet.
Doesn't require anything more than the garden hose. Suggested
retail price: $10.
</P>
<P>
   3. SuperSpiral Sprinkler by Little Tikes: A combination
sprinkler/water ballgame. Looks like a lot of fun for younger kids,
say 8 and younger. Suggested retail price: $12.99.
</P>
<P>
   4. Storm: Tsunami Force 5 by Trendmasters: This sleek-looking
water gun has lights that turn the water stream into ``liquid
lightning.'' We're not so sure about that _ but it is a great
option for hot summer evenings. You'll need two AA batteries.
Etoys.com priced this toy at $44.99, so if you see it on sale, grab
it.
</P>
<P>
   5. Sesame Street Elmo 1-2-3 Sprinkler by Fisher Price: Here's
one for the littlest kids. There's a mist setting that will keep
babies cool, a gentle stream setting for toddlers and a spinning
setting for preschoolers. Suggested retail price: $17.99.

'CHUTE, THIS GUY'S GOING FOR THE RECORD
</HEADLINE>
  (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
 By LIZ STEVENS 
 c.2000 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   DENTON, Texas _ Meet Mike Zang, the nuttiest guy this side of
the stratosphere.
</P>
<P>
   Actually, Zang is completely sane. He just has this one crazy
scheme up his, uh, flight suit.
</P>
<P>
   He wants to break the world record for the most sky dives in a
24-hour period.
</P>
<P>
   Guess how many that is.
</P>
<P>
   30?
</P>
<P>
   Keep going.
</P>
<P>
   50?
</P>
<P>
   Try again.
</P>
<P>
   103?
</P>
<P>
   No, kids. The record is 476, and Zang thinks he can beat it by
up to 75 jumps. At 9 a.m. on March 7, 2001, he'll begin his attempt
at Skydive Texas in Denton, north of Fort Worth.
</P>
<P>
   You're probably wondering _ as we were _ what the heck he's
thinking. The simple answer is the 30-year-old Zang loves sky
diving and has since his first jump in autumn 1991. He put himself
through sky-diving school the next spring and has racked up 2,569
jumps total. (He proposed to his wife during No. 68.)
</P>
<P>
   Zang, who lives in Dallas, spent March in Arizona working toward
his FAA license to be a parachute rigger (the rigger packs and
maintains the reserve parachute, the sky diver's last chance for
survival). Jay Stokes, who broke the world record for jumps in
November 1999, just happened to be Zang's mentor that month.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's the one who got me into doing this in the first place,''
says Zang, a Continental Airlines co-pilot during weekdays and
father of two. ``He wants somebody to break his record so he can
break that again.''
</P>
<P>
   The operation will require 30 parachute rigs, two Pilatus Porter
airplanes, approximately 150 volunteers (including Stokes), a
doctor, two sky-dive judges and two attorneys (to notarize the
paperwork for the Guinness folks). Zang's attempt will be the first
using two single-engine turbine aircraft, which can climb 2,000
feet per minute at sea level, and his state-of-the-art parachutes
will save him 3 to 5 seconds per jump.
</P>
<P>
   There's only one glitch: money. Renting the two planes that
might carry him to victory will cost Zang a cool $20,000. He's
looking for individual and corporate sponsorships and hopes to
raise $100,000 for Special Olympics. So far he's up to 200 bucks,
but he's hoping that his Web site, www.jump4kids.org, will draw
more attention to the event.
</P>
<P>
   We'll be checking back with Zang every so often, right up to his
attempt, and trying all the while to figure out why a seemingly
sane guy would do such a thing.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am very much a Type A,'' Zang admits, laughing.
</P>
<P>
   That's ``A'' for Airborne.

 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   While living in Iowa two years ago, I saw the sky turn green. A
number of events rapidly followed: The tornado sirens blared, my
husband and I took shelter downstairs, and the Weather Channel
visuals blipped off the television set. Then the electricity went
out, and I frantically wondered if I had remembered to recharge the
radio's batteries so we could monitor the tornado's movement.
</P>
<P>
   Had I? Of course not. For me, and for most people in the
developed world, the occasional power disruption cannot disrupt the
expectation that as sure as the sun rises, the lights will go on in
the morning when the bedroom switch is clicked. But there are
increasingly more situations where it is desirable or necessary to
be independent of the electricity grid and freed of what Rory
Stear, the chief executive of Freeplay Energy, a company that makes
hand-powered radios and flashlights, calls ``the tyranny of the
disposable battery.''
</P>
<P>
   Situations where you might not want to be _ or cannot be _
tethered to an electrical socket include boating and camping, as
well as crises that knock out power, like tornadoes, hurricanes and
earthquakes. In many places in developing nations, there is no
electricity grid to knock out, but people there still need
electricity. And the need for easily available energy is compounded
as laptops, cell phones and personal digital assistants put
portable computing into more hands.
</P>
<P>
   The alternative energy source is old-fashioned. All you need are
some calories, H2 O, O2 and maybe some vitamins. The human body is
a powerful source of energy. Many electrical devices now taken for
granted had human-powered antecedents that date to only a
generation ago. My farm-girl mother can remember churning butter by
hand, and my father recalls starting a friend's Model T Ford, ``a
temperamental beast,'' with a hand crank. Today, companies are
looking at ways to use the human body to power CD players, cell
phones and even home computers.
</P>
<P>
   Most human-powered devices are entirely mechanical, with a
direct relationship between input and output. Simple human-powered
devices that use electricity, like bicycle lights, can generate
energy but not store it. But the human-powered devices being
developed today are designed to use energy more efficiently and,
most important, are built to store energy.
</P>
<P>
   Freeplay Energy, which was formed in 1995, sells a human-powered
flashlight lantern and human-powered radios. Cranking the handle on
its newest handheld radio for 30 seconds yields about 45 minutes of
play (larger models play for an hour with 30 seconds of cranking).
The same effort provides three to six minutes of light from the
Freeplay lantern.
</P>
<P>
   The Freeplay products use a mechanism that winds a steel spring
from one spool to another. When the spring returns to its original
position, it drives a DC generator, which sends current to the
device. Successive cranking can also store energy in the lantern's
rechargeable battery, or the lantern can be plugged into an outlet.
Some Freeplay radios can capture solar energy.
</P>
<P>
   Similar products on the market include the Nightstar flashlight
made by Applied Innovative Technologies. The company's president,
Steve Vetorino, said, ``Thirty seconds of shaking at three shakes
per second will provide high illumination for five minutes and a
lesser light (enough to read by) for about 20 minutes.'' For longer
illumination, Vetorino said, the Nightstar should be turned off
every two to three minutes and shaken for 10 to 15 seconds. The
shaking makes a magnet move through a wire coil, generating
current, which can be stored.
</P>
<P>
   Hand-cranked products are sold for diverse reasons all over the
world. The Freeplay radios are bought and distributed by many
international aid agencies working in remote places, like Kosovo.
In the United States, the radios and lights are bought by campers
and by some households to keep for emergencies.
</P>
<P>
   Freeplay's sales rose significantly in the United States at the
end of last year because of concerns about Year 2000 problems. The
sales in this country indicated an Olympian level of panic, while
sales were calm and orderly in Britain and Germany.
</P>
<P>
   As the Web increasingly becomes liberated from wire, the
application of human power to computing and communications will
become more crucial. If you have the latest laptop, pager, cell
phone or PDA, you can go a fair way without recharging, but you
cannot go on safari in the Serengeti. A number of companies and
institutions are addressing that problem.
</P>
<P>
   The Freeplay lantern can already be used to power another
device, like a personal stereo. Freeplay is also developing pocket
devices to power things like cell phones or PDA's and larger
hand-cranked generators for writers who have laptops and good upper
arm tone and who want to escape to desert islands.
</P>
<P>
   For the past year, the Bridges Equipment Co. has has been
selling AladdinPower devices _ human-powered electricity generators
invented by Nissho Engineering, a Japanese company. AladdinPower
was recently spun off as its own company, based in Tampa.
AladdinPower's handheld rechargers and its Stepcharger, which is
pumped by stepping on it (but it is now out of stock), can be used
to power cell phones, handheld radios, personal CD players and, in
the case of the Stepcharger, which operates at a higher voltage,
laptops.
</P>
<P>
   Keith Collins, president and chief executive of AladdinPower,
said that about two to three minutes of pumping on the handheld
charger gave a cell phone user approximately 20 minutes to use the
phone, depending on the vigor of the pumping. Tens of thousands of
AladdinPower units have been sold, Collins said. He predicted that
``300 million units will be sold in the next 10 years because of
the expansion of cellular markets worldwide.''
</P>
<P>
   The Massachusetts Institute of Technology's Media Laboratory is
working on human-powered electric devices, but in a far sneakier
way. The idea of this parasitic power harvesting is to generate
power in an ancillary way while people are doing things like
walking or typing, or to pick up energy from the body as it
breathes, pumps blood and generates heat. All of these potential
sources of power were examined in 1995 by Dr. Thad Starner, who was
then a graduate student at the Media Lab and is now an assistant
professor at the Georgia Institute of Technology; he concluded that
the heel strike would be the most easily tapped and potent source
of energy.

 UNDATED: of energy.  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Since then, Dr. Joseph Paradiso, a researcher at the Media Lab,
and his students have developed various shoe inserts that convert
walking energy into electrical current. The inserts are made of a
piezoelectric material, which generates voltage when placed under
mechanical stress. Paradiso said the Maxwell Smart-like shoe could
power pagers, health monitors and emergency receivers, or it could
be used to charge a battery to power devices like phones or small
computers. ``It's probably the best way to take energy out of the
body,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   But the balance between energy harvesting and a comfy shoe isn't
easy to achieve. ``If you do it wrong,'' Paradiso said, ``they'll
be the worst shoes you ever wore.'' His research group is not the
only one hoping to develop a power shoe prototype. The Electric
Shoe Co., based in Britain, is also working on the technology.
</P>
<P>
   For such a shoe to be a viable commercial product, people would
have to find it to be durable, affordable and worth wearing as a
fashion statement.
</P>
<P>
   The ability to scavenge power from the human body is also of
interest to the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency, or
Darpa, which is also developing shoe-power programs.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Robert Nowak, a program manager at Darpa, said researchers
wanted to generate one to two watts per shoe. He said, ``Most
similar technologies produce only milliwatts, which won't have much
practical value for the military user.'' The shoes will be used to
power radios, computers and night vision and navigational
equipment, as well as to recharge batteries. They could also power
detectors that could warn soldiers away from mine fields
</P>
<P>
   One challenge for harnessing human power is finding ways to
match various systems with the energy needs of any given machine.
Radios and small lights require relatively small wattage, but
current human-powered generators could not be easily used to run
the family television. The Seiko kinetic watch, Auto Relay, is a
particularly good fit between the energy harvesting ability of the
device and the wattage it requires. All the wearer has to do is
move, and the watch works.
</P>
<P>
   Human power also lends itself to products like toys; to a land
mine detector that Freeplay is developing with Battelle, a military
product developer; and to a variety of transportation alternatives.
In addition to the commonplace, like bicycles and rowboats, the
human-powered transportation found on various Web sites includes
four-wheel bikes that drive like cars, landrowers (a tricycle that
is powered by pulling on the handlebars), watercycles and
submarines. One of the oddest sites features a human-powered
ornithopter, which perfectly captures the slightly kooky nature of
using the human body to power other devices. It raises the ancient
_ and some would argue, answered _ question, Can we fly with
human-powered flapping?

SOCIAL CONSERVATIVES SHUNNED AT GOP CONVENTION &HT;    By DAN FREEDMAN
 &HT;    c. 2000 Hearst Newspapers
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHILADELPHIA _ There is no time allotted at the Republican
National Convention to a right-to-life speaker or any other
hard-core social conservative, but GOP planners did manage to find
a speaking slot for the World Wrestling Federation champ, ``The
Rock.''
</P>
<P>
   Within that contrast lies a bitter truth for the Republican
Party's right-wing true believers: They're being kept out of sight
as Texas Gov. George W. Bush's strategists bring on a parade of,
well, people you wouldn't expect at a Republican convention.
</P>
<P>
   Take ``The Rock,'' for instance. Named Dwayne Johnson at his
birth, ``The Rock'' (aka ``the people's champion'') is the star of
Smackdown!, a wildly popular WWF wrestling show.
</P>
<P>
   Wednesday night, ``The Rock'' helped House Speaker Dennis
Hastert, R-Ill., a former high school wrestling coach, call the
convention to order.
</P>
<P>
   Conservatives were miffed.
</P>
<P>
   L. Brent Bozell III, a veteran social conservative activist who
is chairman of the Hollywood-based Parents Television Council,
condemned ``The Rock'' and ``Smackdown!'' as anti-woman, anti-black
and grotesquely violent.
</P>
<P>
   ``I highly doubt that a man of your character would want to
share the podium with (a wrestler) who regularly uses obscene and
profane language, has taken metal chairs, a shovel and a
sledgehammer to opponents, and refers to women's genitalia'' in
slang words Bozell wrote Hastert.
</P>
<P>
   In an interview, Bozell argued that an appearance by ``The
Rock'' would undermine any Republican effort to reduce television
violence or tone down popular music lyrics.
</P>
<P>
   ``It'll come back to haunt them,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Rock'' is only the most visible representative of the
non-traditional speakers and performers at the Republican
convention. The first three nights have featured Hispanic
businessmen, pelvis-thrusting entertainers, students from a Houston
charter school, an openly gay member of Congress and a speech by
former Joint Chiefs of Staff chairman Gen. Colin Powell about his
support of abortion rights and affirmative action.
</P>
<P>
   But for Republican social conservatives, there's been a
deafening silence on topics such as banning abortion and halting
gay rights.
</P>
<P>
   ``There ought to be someone on the convention schedule who
exemplifies the pro-life cause; helping women through alternatives
to abortion,'' said Charles Donovan, head of the conservative
Family Research Council. ``We're more concerned about the messages
they're not sending than how some of those messages are being
interpreted at this convention.''
</P>
<P>
   Gary Bauer, who campaigned for the Republican presidential
nomination earlier this year as an anti-abortion conservative, said
the convention's tone would be different had he been chosen as the
party's nominee.
</P>
<P>
   ``But I wasn't,'' he said in an interview. Still, he added, ``on
Election Day voters will not be confused about which party is
pro-life and which party is not. If there is confusion, Bush will
lose.''
</P>
<P>
   While conservatives weren't invited to address the convention,
they did score victories in the GOP platform, getting tough
language on abortion and gays.
</P>
<P>
   Bush operatives smile when asked about the social conservative
freeze-out.
</P>
<P>
   Bush's ``style of leadership is `we're all God's children,'''
said Don Evans, his campaign manager. ``It's `leave no child
behind,' whether that child is African-American or Hispanic or
grows up to have a different sexual orientation.''
</P>
<P>
   Democrats are having fun with Republican angst over contentious
social issues.
</P>
<P>
   ``They've put their crazy aunts in the attic ... and they're
rolling out all this diversity imagery to make the party look like
what it's not _ tolerant,'' said Craig Smith, a former aide to
President Clinton and briefly Vice President Al Gore's campaign
manager.
</P>
<P>
   At least one social conservative is philosophical about
invisibility on the podium.
</P>
<P>
   ``When we were insurgents, it was more important for one of our
people to speak,'' said Randy Tate, former head of the Christian
Coalition and now the head of Republican affairs for the political
website, Voter.com. ``Now religious conservatives are mainstreamed
into the party, so there's less of a need to have `your guy' up
there. They feel comfortable with Bush. They're not being put in
the back seat.''

 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHILADELPHIA _ In the media tents off the floor of the
Republican National Convention here, in a corner dubbed Internet
Alley, the crowd is young, the style is geek chic and the latest in
computer gadgetry is on display. It's all part of a not-so-quiet
Internet revolution, say those who work here, that has the
potential to shake up the world of politics.
</P>
<P>
   Just as television made its political debut at the Republican
convention in Philadelphia in 1948 _ and politics has never been
the same _ the Web has made its way to the convention here. Whether
it is a way of connecting delegates and building party loyalty or a
means of promoting grass-roots political activism among those not
present, a wired world has been constructed here to link the
convention floor to cyberspace.
</P>
<P>
   There are ``dot-com delegates'' participating in a virtual
convention. Politicians who once never knew the difference between
e-mail and eBay are now lining up to participate in political chat
rooms with ``e-jockeys'' as hosts. One Web site, with five
360-degree cameras, offers streaming video that allows site
visitors to scan the convention floor, zooming in and out for
close-ups of individual delegations and delegates.
</P>
<P>
   Polls are being taken online while speakers are on the podium,
providing a real-time reaction to their speeches. And there are
chat rooms, feedback forums, discussion groups and ways for Web
users to talk back and talk about politicians.
</P>
<P>
   The goal is to break down the physical barriers between those
who are at the convention and those who are not.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're not replacing any medium _ we are a new medium,'' said
David Borhman, chief executive of Pseudo.com, which offers the
360-degree cameras and online chats with politicians. ``We are
going to have a role in politics, but we don't know what it will
be. This convention is a test for us, just as the first television
cameras here 52 years ago were a test.''
</P>
<P>
   The Webmasters here say their sites are superior to television
because they are interactive while television is not. Television
provides viewers with a set body of information at a set time that
is selected by the network. Web surfers, not bound by the same
constraints, are able to turn to these sites to pull up candidates'
speeches, videos of the proceedings and party position papers or to
engage in political chat rooms when and for as long as they want.
Television networks have tapped into the Web world, too, offering
live video and audio from the convention and message boards.
</P>
<P>
   Those in Internet Alley say that the Web has the ability to
encourage grass-roots political involvement at a time when voter
participation is declining and that it can challenge the ability of
parties and pundits to set the political agenda.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, it is hard to determine the exact impact these sites
are having. Their audience is still small _ none of the sites are
on any list of the 100 most popular sites. But Pseudo.com says its
chat rooms are filled with people saying they are new to the
political process. And on MTV's ChooseOrLose.com, the most heavily
visited part of the site is its SpeakUp section, where Web users
share political opinions.
</P>
<P>
   Steve Schneider, a research fellow at the Annenberg Public
Policy Center at the University of Pennsylvania, said: ``Can we
measure the impact on this election? Not at this time. But what we
are seeing is political junkies turning to the Web for information,
and Web junkies turning into these political sites.''
</P>
<P>
   Robert B. Vanasse, vice president for programming at Voter.com,
said, ``What we are doing is not just chats and message boards.''
The site offers text and video of the convention floor proceedings,
comparisons of the candidates' records, chat rooms with politicians
and a daily topic for political debate with an interactive poll.
</P>
<P>
   Not wanting to miss an opportunity, the Republican Party has
also jumped on the Web bandwagon. Its convention site,
www.gopconvention.com, not only provides information on daily
events to delegates, but also connects the activities here to some
15,000 dot-com delegates who are participating online.
</P>
<P>
   Dot-com delegates _ anyone who wants to be one can register _
receive daily e-mail messages telling them the ``talking points''
the party gives to every delegate each morning in case they run
into reporters. The online delegates can submit questions to be
answered each day by Republican leaders here, receive daily news
reports about their state's delegation and participate in surveys.
</P>
<P>
   For the party, it's a way of capturing e-mail addresses for
future mailings in the fall campaign and a way of building
enthusiasm. ``E-mail, e-mail, e-mail,'' said Lawrence J. Purpuro,
deputy chief of staff for the Republican National Committee,
explaining the site's purpose. ``We are out to build relationships
with the party. For us, the Web is a powerful medium. We can give
folks the information we want; we can ask them what issues they
care about. Because it is interactive, it is essentially the best
focus group money can buy.''
</P>
<P>
   Of course, many in Internet Alley see information flowing in the
other direction, from ordinary voters and to the parties.
SpeakOut.com, a nonpartisan site designed to increase political
activism, has the ability to record a visitor's response to a
convention speaker during the speech on something called,
informally, a ``mood meter.'' Once signed in, a person watches the
speech on MSNBC and then continually scrolls along an online bar
recording reactions, favorable or less favorable, to each line of
the speech.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   SpeakOut.com puts these analyses online. For instance, of 1,200
people using the mood meter to judge the first convention night
speeches, Laura Bush scored particularly well among women who were
undecided. Colin L. Powell scored as high as George W. Bush's taped
presentation among Bush voters, but he was outscored by Bush among
undecided voters.
</P>
<P>
   ``I explained to one congressman what was going to be happening
during his speech,'' said Rekha Chalasani, director of public
affairs for SpeakOut.Com. ``He just looked at me and said, `You've
got to be kidding.' But we aren't. Conventions are so scripted.
This gets beyond the pundits and prognosticators and shows how
people are really reacting.''
</P>
<P>
   Todd Vitale, director of political programs for Voter.com, said:
``We were able to use our site as a channel to give the Republican
party input on the platform. The Web is making it hard for those in
Washington to be so isolated.''
</P>
<P>
   There are computer kiosks put up by Voter.com in the hotels
where delegates are staying to provide information on daily
convention events. Congressional Quarterly and Motorola are
distributing pagers with e-mail capability and access to news
stories to anyone asking for them. (The Republican Party turned
down an offer to provide every delegate with one, but the Democrats
will be giving them to all delegates at their convention in Los
Angeles, Aug. 14 to 17.)
</P>
<P>
   Where will this all lead? ``I could see the day,'' said Burton
Pines, director of Internet operations for the Republican National
Committee, ``when we have a three-day virtual convention and a
one-day real one.''

 &HT;    Author finds new winner in perfect man
 &HT;    By Don O'Briant
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Linda Howard has come a long way since she wrote her first book
about children lost in the wilderness. Of course, the Hokes Bluff,
Ala., writer was only 9, and the story's readership was limited to
her family.
</P>
<P>
   Since then, the 50-year-old author has attracted a wider
audience. Seven of her novels have been best sellers, and her
newest, ``Mr. Perfect'' (Pocket Books, $24.95), appears headed that
way.
</P>
<P>
   Part romance novel, part suspense thriller, ``Mr. Perfect''
begins with four women jotting down a list of attributes that make
a perfect man. Some of the qualities include faithfulness,
dependability, a sense of humor and certain sexual abilities. The
women never imagine the list will make them the targets of a
killer.
</P>
<P>
   Howard says she didn't bother polling women about their
requirements for the perfect man. ``I was cleaning up the kitchen,
and this conversation started playing in my head between a group of
friends as to what would make a perfect man,'' she says. ``The
whole book was built around that conversation.''
</P>
<P>
   Actually, she adds, most women wouldn't want a perfect man. ``If
he was perfect, they'd want to mess him up. The whole point of the
book is that no one's perfect; you have to work and adjust and
compromise.''
</P>
<P>
   In the novel, the men are threatened by the list. Howard doesn't
have that problem with her husband, Gary Howington.
</P>
<P>
   ``He doesn't read my books,'' she says, laughing. ``He's an
outdoorsman, and he fishes the Bass Masters tournaments. That's
what he does for a living. He hasn't even seen the list.''

 &HT;    Years before MTV, Now Explosion, an Atlanta TV show, created its
own music videos
 &HT;    By Miriam Longino
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Music video channel VH1 says Aug. 1, 1981, is a landmark date in
rock history. Airing ``The 100 Greatest Rock and Roll Moments on
TV'' this week, the self-appointed rock historians noted that it
was the day when MTV launched the nation's first music video
television show. (Sound of needle being ripped across a vinyl 45.)
</P>
<P>
   Well, not exactly.
</P>
<P>
   (Scratch, pop, hiss. Turn up the spacey, distorted guitar intro
of the 1970 Norman Greenbaum hit, ``Spirit in the Sky.'')
</P>
<P>
   Let's set the record straight. The nation's first music video
show didn't start in New York in 1981, and it wasn't MTV. An early
chapter in the video revolution happened right here in Atlanta,
over a fleeting, nine-month period in 1970, when a group of young
disc jockeys and film producers (eventually with the help of Ted
Turner) launched a 28-hour weekend block of music videos called
``Now Explosion.''
</P>
<P>
   Now Explosion (echo: explosion, explosion, explosion,
explosion...).
</P>
<P>
   Imagine the psychedelia of Austin Powers blended with the trippy
light shows of Filmore West with a little ``Laugh-In'' bikini
dancing sprinkled into the mix: Hippies frolicking in Piedmont Park
to the Plastic Ono Band's ``Instant Karma.'' Traffic speeding past
the Varsity to the sounds of ``Vehicle'' by the Ides of March.
Bikini clad young girls _ surrounded by floating blobs of paisley _
dancing to Creedence Clearwater Revival's ``Lookin' Out My Back
Door'' at the Channel 36 studios.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was 16 and thought it was the closest thing to rock 'n' roll
heaven that I would ever get,'' says 47-year-old Alice Walker of
Gay, Ga. ``I can still hear my mother saying, `Are you watching
that rock music show? Turn it down!' I envied the dancers.''
</P>
<P>
   One was 48-year-old advertising executive Lori Krinsk who hopped
in the car with a fringed-vested friend one night in 1970, wound up
at the Channel 36 studios and danced on-air to ``Spirit in the
Sky.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't remember much,'' she says with a laugh. ``It was kind
of cool. We waited for hours, then they said, `Come on in and
dance.' They did that weird photography that shows just your shadow
and outline in psychedelic colors. What a riot.''
</P>
<P>
   The mere mention of the words ``Now Explosion'' send Dan Turner,
a 47-year-old jazz pianist from Conyers, Ga., into a retro stream
of consciousness: ``The fog lifts. ...Lazy days sitting around
watching TV. ...My friend in knee-high moccasin boots. ... Staring
at the background stuff on the screen all day in between runs to
the Krystal. ... It was way ahead of MTV.''
</P>
<P>
   Sam Judd, 47, of Douglasville says, ``When MTV came along, I
tried to explain that this type of programming had already been
tried in Atlanta, and no one remembered it but me.''
</P>
<P>
   Just how did one of the nation's first music video experiment--
wind up in a then-sleepy Southern town? The story, which stretches
from March to November of 1970, goes something like this:
</P>
<P>
   ``Now Explosion'' was the brainchild of a flamboyant
Philadelphia businessman named Bob Whitney. With a background in
radio (reportedly as a producer for Dick Clark), Whitney came up
with the idea of broadcasting Top-40 radio on television _ TV you
could not just hear but watch. Or as the promotional brochure said
at the time, ``TV so turned on you can't turn it off.''
</P>
<P>
   After supposedly bankrolling $25,000 to launch his concept,
Whitney tapped two Atlanta deejays, ``Skinny'' Bobby Harper and Bob
Todd, to host the show and introduce records. The two had been top
jocks on WQXI-AM (``Quixie in Dixie''), Atlanta's only rock and
roll station throughout the '60s, and were primed for the job.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were the first video deejays,'' says Harper, 61, now a
communications consultant for the Georgia Student Finance
Commission (HOPE Scholarship Program). ``We didn't have videos
handed to us; there was no such thing back then. We had to make
them all.''
</P>
<P>
   Todd, 54, who now lives in Ocala, Fla., recalls the days when
UHF stations (these were the high-band channels long before cable)
were desperate for programming to fill their air time, especially
on weekends. ``We used the studios at Channel 36 during the middle
of the night when the station was dark. It was a non-union
facility, so we could play with all the equipment.''
</P>
<P>
   Getting the music was no problem; ``Now Explosion'' simply used
records of the day (without notifying any of the licensing
agencies, such as BMI. It was the era of love and peace, after
all.). But getting visuals to air over the songs was a challenge.
</P>
<P>
   The job of creating the look of Now Explosion was handed to a
28-year-old television producer named R.T. Williams. The brash
young broadcaster had begun his career on a more traditional route,
as a producer for Atlanta's channel 11. But when Whitney laid his
new concept of a music video program out on the table, Williams
took the bait.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was so incredibly simple, but so different,'' he says
today, peering over a pair of glasses under a head of graying hair.
``You never know that history is being made when it's being made.
We were really the first to do that kind of interpretive video to
music.''
</P>
<P>
   Williams quit his mainstream job, grabbed a Norelco PCP 90
portable camera, and starting filming. His job: to produce five
original videos for each song aired on the program.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you look at music videos today, keep in mind that MTV
doesn't produce any of this stuff. We had to hatch and fry the eggs
that we made.''
</P>
<P>
   Williams and crew turned to the psychedelic images of the day,
and their own imaginations, to churn out what amounts to an
estimated 1,700 hours of primitive music videos in all. Many were
filmed on location here in Atlanta: street scenes of girls in jeans
and gingham dresses from the ``hippie'' district between 10th and
14th streets; shots of students in big Afros coming and going at
area high schools; politically-themed segments, such as ``Bridge
Over Troubled Water,'' played over film of Martin Luther King Jr.'s
``I Have a Dream'' speech; dancers gyrating in front of a blue
screen filled with special effects _ girls that Todd says he and
Harper ``picked up down on Peachtree.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We would carry an empty, 2-inch videotape cannister with an
ABC-TV sticker on it, and ask pretty young girls if they wanted to
come down to channel 36 at midnight and put on skimpy outfits and
dance,'' Todd now laughs. ``And they did.''
</P>
<P>
   Occasionally, Top-40 acts would drop by the studio to lip synch
their hits, such as Kenny Rogers and the First Edition, who
interpreted ``Just Dropped In (To See What Condition My Condition
Was In)'' for Now Explosion. ``Oh, yeah, I remember it,'' Rogers
says. ``I had this long hair, a big bushy beard, rose-colored
glasses and an earring. I actually thought I looked good.''
</P>
<P>
   But this was no ``American Bandstand.''
</P>
<P>
   With no blueprint to go by, the crew literally made up the
groovy look of Now Explosion with a series of special effects that
Williams still gets excited about today.
</P>
<P>
   ``There was the `rhythm zoom,' where the camera would zoom in
and out real fast,'' he recalls. ``Then we did the `quad split,'
where we'd show the same image in all four corners of the screen.
The `reverse chroma key' was like they do now with weathermen in
front of the weather map, where we would have a negative outline of
a dancer.''
</P>
<P>
   Now Explosion was only on the air for a few weeks when trouble
erupted. According to the then-staffers, the company that owned
channel 36 was threatening to take over the show. Williams
remembers that Whitney called a secret meeting in a room at the
Emory Sheraton Hotel on Clifton Road.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a raid-planning party,'' he says. ``We rented some
trucks, and went over to the station (channel 36) about 3 a.m. It
was a driving rainstorm, and there were still two people working in
master control. We went in and started hne. Next thing, we saw the
lights and heard the sirens.''
</P>
<P>
   But the Now Explosion crew somehow avoided the law, and smuggled
the tapes to Florida.
</P>
<P>
   Days later, the program premiered on channel 17, a new UHF
station owned by an entrepreneur named Ted Turner. Turner quickly
signed on to air Now Explosion all weekend, and also agreed to dub
the videos in his studio on West Peachtree Street for syndication
across the country.
</P>
<P>
   Eventually, Now Explosion wound up on 111 UHF stations,
including stations in Philadelphia and New York. But like the
Woodstock era that spawned it, its life was short. Mounting bills
and an incredible demand for video footage caused Whitney and crew
to throw in the towel in November 1970.
</P>
<P>
   Williams went on to manage production for the channel 17
superstation, WTBS. Harper worked as a spokesperson for Delta
Airlines for many years, while Todd and his son started a video
production company in Florida. No one knows what happened to
Whitney, who was last seen in San Francisco around 1974.
</P>
<P>
   As for the Now Explosion tapes, they wound up in a garage in
Coral Gables, Fla., where they were reportedly destroyed in a flood
around 1972. It's not likely any of the dubs exist either. Williams
says they were shot on expensive two-inch, quad video tape.
</P>
<P>
   ``A 10-hour reel cost $20,000,'' he says, noting that television
stations were likely to tape over the footage as soon as it was
obsolete.
</P>
<P>
   Todd still owns a one-hour tape of the show, which he dug out of
a box in the attic to share a snippet of it with the AJC. Williams
once had two reels, but left them in his office at WTBS when he
departed in 1984. ``Who knows what happened to them,'' he says
today.
</P>
<P>
   Though just a blip on the pop culture meter, Now Explosion left
lasting impressions. In the early '80s, a funky, kitschy local band
, led by Clare Butler, adopted the name and toured the East Coast.
Others who watched the show say it had lasting effects on them,
too.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was in the 7th grade, and can still see some of the
videos,'' recalls Leza Young, 42, of Chamblee. ``Bobby Sherman
dancing in front of four large studio panels to ``Easy Come, Easy
Go.'' The clip for ``Little Green Bag.'' The woman dancing to Freda
Payne's ``Band of Gold.'' The poor hitchhiker standing in the rain
in ``Kentucky Rain.'' So much of my taste in music developed as a
result of that show _ I now have a degree in rock radio and was a
deejay for several years.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I think one reason I got so interested in music and do what I
do today came from sitting around all weekend watching that
thing,'' says Atlanta concert promoter Peter Conlon. ``They played
songs that you couldn't hear on the radio here, like ``Little Green
Bag'' and ``Fire'' by Arthur Brown. It was kind of like FM before
everybody had FM radio.''

 &HT;    TV's `Fugitive' goes on run in Savannah
 &HT;    By Jill Young Miller
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAVANNAH, Ga. _ Dr. Richard Kimble resumed his harried flight
from police Lt. Philip Gerard here this week. ``Yesterday I spent
10 hours sprinting, in the heat, on the cobblestone streets, up and
down the stairs,'' said Kimble, aka Tim Daly, who plays the
doc-on-the-lam in the upcoming CBS revival of ``The Fugitive.''
</P>
<P>
   Despite the grinding workout, Savannah's allure wasn't lost on
the actor. ``I love all these little parks,'' Daly said Wednesday,
cooling down as an SUV ferried him from a shoot at the riverfront
to another location, near Chippewa Square. ``The Spanish moss. It's
a really nice little town.''
</P>
<P>
   It's the town ``Fugitive'' producers chose for the revival's
first episode, expected to air in October, following a pilot that
starts the saga in Chicago. As in the classic '60s series, Daly's
Kimble is wrongly convicted of murdering his wife, then is chased
from city to city by Gerard, in turn pursuing the real killer, a
mysterious one-armed man.
</P>
<P>
   The series will be shot on location in places around the
country. ``I'm choosing cities that are very identifiable,'' said
R.W. Griffin, an executive producer. From Savannah, Kimble scurries
to Charleston, S.C., Philadelphia, Atlantic City, N.J., New Orleans
and San Francisco.
</P>
<P>
   And Atlanta? ``Atlanta's not ruled out,'' said John McNamara,
another executive producer.
</P>
<P>
   But there's a hitch. ``What we're looking for are things you
couldn't see elsewhere,'' McNamara said.
</P>
<P>
   Savannah has lured many a production company with its
live-oak-lined streets. Savannah police officer Julia Krebs works
security at enough movie and TV shoots every year that she can fund
her vacations.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is pretty low-key compared to what I've seen,'' Krebs
said. ``When Clint Eastwood was here, people were going crazy.
Screaming. Trying to rush him to get his autograph.'' Eastwood
directed 1997's ``Midnight in the Garden of Good and Evil,'' which
was both set and filmed in Savannah.
</P>
<P>
   When Robertut Ryan likes it when TV and movie stars visit.
``It's great for the city, because they shoot a lot of the scenery,
and tourism is one of our biggest assets.''

TALKS WITH FORD INDICATE CHINA IS LOOSENING GRIP ON AUTO INDUSTRY 
</HEADLINE>
   By CRAIG S. SMITH   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   SHANGHAI, China _ Ford Motor Co. is deep in negotiations with
Changan Automobile Group to build an affordable passenger car in
China, the latest in a series of signs that the country is
loosening its grip on the auto industry ahead of its expected entry
into the World Trade Organization later this year.
</P>
<P>
   Ford has tried for years to get into the Chinese market after
having lost to General Motors in a fierce competition in mid-'90s
for the last major car deal sanctioned under the government's
auto-industry master plan. After GM won the right to build Buicks
in Shanghai, the government started talking instead about shutting
manufacturers down. China has more than 100 car manufacturers,
including those that assemble cars using kits imported from abroad.
</P>
<P>
   But China fears that without an expanded domestic car
manufacturing base, imports could quickly dominate the growing
market after the country joins the WTO. So the government is
relaxing its grip on the industry, allowing car companies rather
than officials in Beijing, to decide what the market can bear.
</P>
<P>
   Honda was allowed to buy a defunct Peugeot joint venture in
Guangdong province in the south several years ago, and earlier this
year Toyota signed a deal to make passenger cars in the city of
Tianjin in the northeast. Car companies have also been allowed to
again set their own prices; officials stopped the industry from
cutting prices further after a price war in the late '90s. The
Chinese joint ventures of Citroen, Volkswagen and General Motors
have all reduced prices on their cars in the last few months.
</P>
<P>
   While China's automobile sales growth has been sluggish in
recent years and the market has fallen far short of the ebullient
estimates made in the mid-'90s, no one doubts that the country will
eventually become a major auto market. The cities are already
choked with cars, but the country's eastern region is crisscrossed
with new Interstate-style highways, most of them largely empty of
vehicles. And a campaign to develop the long-neglected western
region includes plans to build more highways there.
</P>
<P>
   Already, manufacturers like GM are reporting an unexpected surge
in the number of private car buyers. And small, affordable cars,
like the boxy Suzuki Alto already made by Changan, are the
fastest-growing segment of the market.
</P>
<P>
   In June, Beijing finally gave Ford the go-ahead to negotiate a
joint venture. ``Changan and Ford are now in negotiations trying to
formalize details and prepare the proper documents required to put
the proposal to the government for a final approval,'' said Kenneth
Hsu, a Ford spokesman in China.
</P>
<P>
   Hsu declined to talk about what kind of car might be built or
how large the venture might be, but auto analysts suggest that Ford
is considering a version of its Ikon, a compact four-door sedan
that the company created for the Indian market. The car would be
larger than Changan's Alto but still in a price range that would
put it within the reach of China's new private car buyers.
</P>
<P>
   Ford currently has six Chinese joint ventures producing auto
parts and offering after-sales service. It also has a 30 percent
stake in Jiangling Motors Corp., which makes the Ford Transit, a
light commercial van.
</P>
<P>
   Ford is not the only maker contemplating a small car. Toyota's
joint venture in Tianjin will produce one. And because China has
relaxed restrictions on new models by joint ventures, Volkswagen is
expected to introduce a small car at its Shanghai venture soon.
General Motors has studied the feasibility of building a version of
its Opel Corsa at its Shanghai plant. The company has so far
declined to comment on the reports, which suggest that GM Shanghai
could introduce a small-car model as early as this year.

ILLUSTRATED BOOK PUBLISHERS REACH ACQUISITION DEAL 
</HEADLINE>
   By DAVID D. KIRKPATRICK   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Harry N. Abrams Inc. agreed to pay about $6 million to acquire
the assets of Stewart, Tabori &AMP; Chang, combining two prominent
publishers of illustrated books.
</P>
<P>
   Abrams, a unit of the French publishing concern La Martiniere
Groupe, is one of the largest independent illustrated book
publishers in the United States. The company specializes in art and
art history books, like a recent two-volume photograph collection,
``African Ceremonies.''
</P>
<P>
   Stewart, Tabori &AMP; Chang was founded 20 years ago by former
Abrams executives, including Andrew Stewart, the former husband of
the publisher and television personality Martha Stewart.
</P>
<P>
   Stewart, Tabori &AMP; Chang specializes in coffee-table books about
consumer subjects like cooking, decorating and gardening, as well
as popular art books like the recent Blue Dog series.
</P>
<P>
   Paul Gottlieb, chief executive of Abrams, said the acquisition
would broaden its business into more consumer books, which it could
also profitably sell overseas through its parent company's French
and German units. ``We admire their attitude towards style and
presentation,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Abrams' acquisition also includes Golden Turtle Press, a
calendar publisher with licenses to publish calendars featuring
characters from Star Wars, the World Wildlife Fund and the HBO
television series ``The Sopranos.''
</P>
<P>
   U.S. Media Holdings, based in New York, acquired Stewart, Tabori
&AMP; Chang five years ago and this spring filed for Chapter 11
bankruptcy in New York. In February, the company listed assets of
$24.7 million and liabilities of $25 million.
</P>
<P>
   The bankruptcy court this week approved Abrams' bid for Stewart,
Tabori &AMP; Chang. The deal is expected to be completed next week.

TOP CABINET MEMBER ADMITS ACCEPTING QUESTIONABLE DONATIONS 
</HEADLINE>
   By STEPHANIE STROM   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   TOKYO _ The government of Prime Minister Yoshiro Mori was
slammed by its second political scandal in a week Wednesday when
one of his top advisers admitted accepting millions of yen in
questionable political donations.
</P>
<P>
   The chief Cabinet secretary, Hidenao Nakagawa, who is the
government's top spokesman, acknowledged that he had received 8.5
million yen, or $77,810 at current exchange rates, from two persons
in 1997. The maximum donation an individual can lawfully make to a
politician is 1.5 million yen, and the amounts that came to
Nakagawa above that limit arrived in a round-about way.
</P>
<P>
   Nakagawa holds what is arguably the second-highest ranking job
after the prime minister's. Additionally, he is a member of the
inner circle of ruling party politicians that call the shots behind
the scenes.
</P>
<P>
   ``There were no legal violations involved, and I reported to the
Home Affairs Ministry,'' Nakagawa said, denying any impropriety.
``But I will be careful in the future not to repeat it.''
</P>
<P>
   While the donations were questionable, they may not have been
illegal, and it remains to be seen if Nakagawa will be forced to
step down or face any legal action.
</P>
<P>
   But on Sunday, Kimitaka Kuze, another Cabinet member, was forced
to resign as head of the Financial Reconstruction Commission after
acknowledging that he had received 230 million yen, or $2.1
million, for advisory work he did for Mitsubishi Trust and Banking
Corp. over 13 years that ended in 1996. He also accepted 100
million yen, or $915,000, from the head of a condominium developer.
</P>
<P>
   There has been much speculation inside the ruling party, as well
as in the private sector, about why the scandals are breaking one
after the other. Many believe that it may even be the result of
turmoil inside the party, as members jockey to determine who will
take on the mantle of Noboru Takeshita, the former prime minister
whose influence shaped Japanese politics for three decades until he
died shortly before the recent election.
</P>
<P>
   ``Of course, money politics is nothing new in Japan, so the
question is why are all these revelations coming out now?''
Marshall Gittler, a currency strategist at the Bank of America,
asked in a report to investors.
</P>
<P>
   ``It looks as if someone has it in for Prime Minister Mori,'' he
added.
</P>
<P>
   Mori's Cabinet, appointed after general elections in June in
which his ruling Liberal Democratic Party suffered a drubbing in
urban areas, is suffering some of the lowest approval ratings of
any government since World War II.
</P>
<P>
   The prime minister, who is currently undergoing a grilling
during a special parliamentary session over various financial
matters, has been limited to using prepared scripts because of his
penchant for unwittingly making politically incorrect comments.
During the parliamentary debate on Tuesday, he read the same answer
in response to three different questions.
</P>
<P>
   Despite Nakagawa's insistence that he did nothing illegal, the
way in which the money arrived suggests that someone involved knew
the donations were not entirely legitimate.
</P>
<P>
   In one case, a Hiroshima businessman donated a total of 4.5
million yen to Nakagawa. The amount allowed by law, 1.5 million
yen, was accounted for as a donation, according to a Home Affairs
Ministry report. But an additional 3 million yen went to two
political groups that then turned the money over to Nakagawa, the
report said.
</P>
<P>
   Nakagawa received 1.5 million yen from another unidentified
businessman, who also contributed another 2.5 million yen through
two political groups, one of which was used by the first
businessman as well.
</P>
<P>
   The three political organizations, the report said, all have the
same Tokyo address.

SANTA FE OFFERS AN AUTHORITATIVE `FIGARO' &HT;    (Photos available from
http://www.santafeopera.org/PressPhotos/PressPhotos.htm.)
 &HT;    By CHARLES WARD
 &HT;    c. 2000 Houston Chronicle
<TEXT>
<P>
   SANTA FE, N.M. _ What is it about nobility and opera?
</P>
<P>
   On Monday evening, Santa Fe Opera allowed Verdi's libertine Duke
of Mantua to forage the stage for sexual conquests. The next, it
trotted out Mozart's lecherous Count Almaviva to remind the
audience that _ in opera, at least _ noblemen are from some other
sexual galaxy.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, the two ``gentlemen'' were treated in very different
ways. In ``Rigoletto,'' Verdi left his cad unscathed _ he's just
the catalyst for another operatic tragedy. In ``The Marriage of
Figaro,'' Mozart used Almaviva to drive home fundamental lessons
about social inequality.
</P>
<P>
   Mozart and librettist Lorenzo da Ponte did their teaching with
humor, thanks to Pierre Augustin Caron de Beaumarchais, author of
the original 18th-century French drama. Aided by an English
libretto projected electronically to each seat, Tuesday's capacity
audience tittered and cackled as Almaviva's household thwarted his
fundamental goal _ reviving the (began ital)droit du seigneur,(end
ital) which he had recently revoked in a gesture of enlightenment.
</P>
<P>
   The four-act ``Figaro'' occurs in a still-feudal household of
servants and nobility. Almaviva has a simple, base motive. Susanna,
his wife's maid, is about to marry his valet, Figaro. Once more he,
the master of the house, wants the right to enjoy first sexual
relations with a female servant on her wedding night.
</P>
<P>
   Almost everyone else thinks the count is despicable, for this
and other antics. His long-suffering wife leads the servants in a
conspiracy to teach him a lesson about faithfulness and chastity.
He gets the message in a nighttime garden scene when Susanna and
the Countess swap clothes. The Count ends up trying to seduce his
own wife.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, the entire household mirrors Almaviva's own
ambiguity about relationships.
</P>
<P>
   Inspired by the Count's moral example, the freshly pubescent
Cherubino is constantly underfoot, even after Almaviva tries to
send him off to the army. During the young man's many attempts to
be near the ones he loves, he hides behind a chair, locks himself
in the Countess' dressing room and dresses up as a maid presenting
flowers to the royal couple. Always there is complicity from
someone with a weak spot for his youthful innocence.
</P>
<P>
   This maelstrom swirls around the Count. Seemingly all-powerful,
he is actually helpless in the face of his household's collective
determination. They thwart every ploy he uses to get to Susanna.
Even a plot to blackmail Figaro into marrying the maid of the
count's friend, Dr. Bartolo, fails. Figaro turns out to be the love
child of maid Marcellina and Bartolo.
</P>
<P>
   Almaviva is right when he complains that his servants have
become brazen. Their capacity to eviscerate his power is the reason
``The Marriage of Figaro'' remains more powerful than
``Rigoletto.'' That's especially true when a cast like Tuesday's
delivers Mozart's extraordinary drama and music with such authority
and pleasure.
</P>
<P>
   Crucially, director Thor Steingraber encouraged the lead men to
play their characters with a democratic nonchalance. German
baritone Jochen Schmeckenbecher and Canadian bass-baritone John
Relyea, respectively, portrayed Almaviva and Figaro with a lanky
physicality that destroyed any pretense to the manor. With a rich
sound, Schmeckenbecher ranged from smoldering sensuality to
smoldering rage. With a more ringing tone, the tall Relyea found
Figaro's backbone in the sense of injustice of the otherwise
easygoing husband-to-be.
</P>
<P>
   The quiet star was English soprano Catrin Wyn-Davies as Susanna.
With dignity, outrage and a show of camaraderie, she held her own
among American veterans of operatic comedies, especially Kevin
Langan as Bartolo and Judith Christin as Marcellina.
</P>
<P>
   English soprano Alwyn Mellor gave the Countess a wounded dignity
in her two great arias, delivered with fuller but less pointed
sound than other major cast members. Joyce DiDonato was bubbling
and exuberant as Cherubino.
</P>
<P>
   Irishman Kenneth Montgomery, who has conducted at Santa Fe
regularly since 1982, led a zestful accompaniment that occasionally
needed a touch more legato and lyricism.
</P>
<P>
   The production was a revival, with sets and costumes by Robert
Perdziola.
</P>
<P>
   Footnote: With a 9 p.m. starting time, ``Figaro'' ran past 12:30
a.m. A sizable portion of Tuesday's audience left during the
intermission before Act Four.

`FOUR SEMI-UGLY AMERICANS' OFFICIAL BUT MOSTLY USELESS GUIDE TO
EASTERN EUROPE'
</HEADLINE>
  (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
 By MIKE COCHRAN 
 c.2000 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BUDAPEST, Hungary _ We got robbed in Prague, sunburned at a
quaint German village and bombarded by an American rock band as we
hiked through the Brandenburg Gate in Berlin.
</P>
<P>
   We checked out Checkpoint Charlie, paddlewheeled up the Elbe
River at Dresden, knocked down Hungarian goulash in Budapest and
pigged out shamelessly on wienerschnitzel all across Europe.
</P>
<P>
   Late one evening, en route to a lake resort, we stumbled into a
secluded countryside inn and watched quietly from the terrace as a
frisky doe played hide-and-seek along the grassy riverbank below.
</P>
<P>
   We did all this in 21 hectic but mostly fun-filled days and
nights while composing what we cleverly called ``Four Semi-Ugly
Americans' Official But Mostly Useless Guide to Eastern Europe.''
</P>
<P>
   However, my editor decided ``Iron Curtain: 2000'' was a mite
more stylish.
</P>
<P>
   With no hotel reservations and only a vague itinerary, our
mission was to explore the former Iron Curtain countries of
Czechoslovakia and Hungary and the former communist enclaves of
East Berlin and Dresden. We would also look in on the officially
neutral but pro-Western country of Austria.
</P>
<P>
   Our friends Bob and Mona joined wife Sondra and me on our June
odyssey, which unfolded more than a decade after the four of us
traveled together across non-communist Western Europe. Motivated
now by collective curiosity, and packed in a rented Lancia station
wagon, we would pierce the phantom partition and visit the people
and places that were pretty much off-limits during our previous
trip.
</P>
<P>
   In the interest of research, we would also sample Europe's
world-famous beers and wines and such local delights as wild boar,
grilled goose and goulash laced with horse meat. I'll confess
upfront that when faced with a dilemma, we invariably opted for
wienerschnitzel. This is fried veal cutlets coated with eggs and
bread crumbs, and roughly equivalent to our chicken-fried steak
without cream gravy.
</P>
<P>
   It normally is served with one of the basic food groups: french
fries. &QL; 
--- &QL;
</P>
<P>
   As luck would have it, we arrived in Europe along with a record
heat wave, a surge of soccer hooliganism at the European
Championships and our own President Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   Our first major destination, we decided, would be Berlin, via
Nuremberg, Bamberg and, most notably, Rothenberg. Medieval
Rothenberg and its lovely Tauber River anchor the ``Romantic
Road,'' which runs from the River Main at Wurzburg south to Fussen
in the foothills of the Swiss and Austrian Alps.
</P>
<P>
   We rolled into Rothenberg during a wine festival and, at a
sidewalk cafe, discovered the country's seasonal obsession with
spargel (asparagus.) Many restaurants feature it daily in a variety
of dishes.
</P>
<P>
   We discovered also that nearby tables were filled with young
German men and that a group of Japanese tourists had appeared on
the scene.
</P>
<P>
   ``Fifty-five years ago, we were killing each other,'' I
observed. &QL; 
___ &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Arriving on the outskirts of Berlin in late afternoon, we
realized the pitfalls of scorning room reservations. Hotels and
guest houses were full, and we spent the night in a hovel called
the Hong Kong Haus.
</P>
<P>
   Ah, but just being in the reunified city was worth any
unpleasantness.
</P>
<P>
   Yielding to popular pressure, the wall was opened in 1989 after
separating the eastern and western zones since the Cold War days of
1961. This created what some call a new Germany. Eleven years
later, we could tell little difference between East and West,
although there is a building frenzy and fewer English-speaking
Germans in the eastern sector.
</P>
<P>
   A tour guide points out that within its unified boundaries,
Germany remains a nation of diversity, ``where the people and
cultures vary as dramatically as the landscapes.''
</P>
<P>
   A young German financier would tell me later that many East
Germans have been slow to grasp capitalism and to reap the economic
benefits it offers.
</P>
<P>
   ``The East German people have another way to think,'' was the
way he put it. ``They don't know how to realize the dream. If you
come from communism to capitalism, you have to turn around. You
must change completely, not only for yourself, but your family and
your friends.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everything is changing. ... Some people find their way fast,
but most people don't.''
</P>
<P>
   While our mates toured the nearby museum, Bob and I researched a
Berliner Pilsner outside the Cafe Adler at the spot known worldwide
as Checkpoint Charlie. A sign remains as a permanent reminder of
that grim period, during which 152 people died while trying to flee
to the West.
</P>
<P>
   ``YOU ARE LEAVING THE AMERICAN SECTOR,'' the sign warns.
</P>
<P>
   There is also a historical marker of sorts that recounts the
Oct. 27, 1961, checkpoint confrontation between U.S. and Soviet
tanks.
</P>
<P>
   ``One day later,'' it says, ``the tanks withdrew as neither the
first secretary of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union Nikita
Khrushchev nor the US President John F. Kennedy wanted a military
confrontation.''
</P>
<P>
   Incidentally, Europeans remain enthusiastic admirers of Kennedy,
and often buttonhole American visitors to discuss his presidency
and his assassination.
</P>
<P>
   Before leaving the checkpoint, we walked down the street and
took pictures of the crumbling wall above a bunker that once housed
the World War II Gestapo headquarters.
</P>
<P>
   A few minutes later, we strolled through the former ``no man's
land'' beyond Brandenburg Gate, where an American rock band
entertained hundreds of Sunday afternoon bikers, skaters, lovers,
families and tourists.
</P>
<P>
   Inspired by the tune ``Come Together,'' a red-haired woman
wiggled from the crowd and, trancelike, danced about crazily.
</P>
<P>
   ``Must be an American,'' I said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Probably a Texan,'' Bob replied. &QL; 
___ &QL;
</P>
<P>
   We spent the night on a small lake outside Berlin, then headed
for Dresden via the autobahn, which has no official upper speed
limit. The recommended 130 kilometers, the equivalent of 80 mph, is
routinely ignored.
</P>
<P>
   We crossed the historic River Elbe at Dresden and parked beside
the heavily bomb-damaged, 14th-century Church of Our Blessed Lady,
which is undergoing meticulous restoration.
</P>
<P>
   The church is called the crown of Dresden, the heart and soul of
the city.
</P>
<P>
   A cultural metropolis, the war-ravaged city itself is an
architectural masterpiece, and its skyline above the Elbe is one of
the most striking sights in Europe.
</P>
<P>
   This is all the more astounding since Allied bombers reduced
much of the city to rubble in a series of raids, the three most
devastating on Feb. 13-14, 1945.
</P>
<P>
   Historians say that more than 3,000 tons of incendiary bombs and
explosives killed thousands in those two days and destroyed a
10-square-mile area of the city. In a book on Dresden, author
Gerhart Hauptmann, who called the city the ``bright morning star of
my youth,'' said of the incredible devastation: MORE &QL; 
nn
</P>
<P>
   ``Whoever has forgotten how to cry, learned it again during the
destruction of Dresden.'' &QL; 
___ &QL;
</P>
<P>
   It was in a beer garden on the Elbe that we met Frank Molitor,
the Dresden financier who in turn introduced us to Ines Wilhelm, a
beautiful young opera singer.
</P>
<P>
   Molitor told us how the country changed dramatically for the
better after the lifting of the Iron Curtain.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a better way of life because you can do what you want.
... You can grow, you can work and you can fail,'' he said. ``You
can make mistakes, and you have to make mistakes to learn.''
</P>
<P>
   Wilhelm said a unified Germany is on the verge of greatness.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're now Germans on our own,'' she explained, then dismissed
the Russians as ``unimportant'' and declared: ``They sold out
Germany.''
</P>
<P>
   Our party closed down the garden that night, and Molitor joined
us the next morning on the paddleboat Dresden for a quick trip up
the Elbe. We left the boat several miles upriver and took a railway
car to a hilltop high above the distant city.
</P>
<P>
   It was but one of countless extraordinary sights. &QL; 
___ &QL;
</P>
<P>
   We left that afternoon for Prague but got sidetracked in the
quaint little river town of Konigstein. Rarely moved by castles and
cathedrals, I was awed by Festung Konigstein, the mountain fortress
above town with a smashing view of the Elbe as it winds gently
through German farmlands and forests.
</P>
<P>
   After hiking up another mountainside, where we drank beer and
wine with a bored cat, we drove along the river to the border and
crossed into the Czech Republic at Hrensko. Our unofficial greeting
party consisted of young prostitutes in revealing shorts and tops,
slinking provocatively along the highway.
</P>
<P>
   Our guide book did not mention the girls of the afternoon but
did point out that since 1989, when the country discarded 40 years
of communist rule, the Czechs had been finding their footing as a
new republic.
</P>
<P>
   ``At the dawn of the 21st century,'' it said, ``the country is
coping with the difficulties and benefits of adapting to Western
capitalism and establishing a new social and economic order.''
</P>
<P>
   As we drove through the lush green hills and farmlands, it was
clear that, while beautiful, the country did not possess the clean,
crisp, prosperous look of Germany or Austria. But Prague, the
``Golden City,'' was a wondrous discovery, its center bursting with
energy and embracing the Vltava River on its east and west banks.
</P>
<P>
   On our second day in the capital, we parked outside Prague
Castle and spent hours walking the cobblestone streets, alleys and
passageways and exploring the gardens, museums, cathedrals,
palaces, concert halls, shops and outdoor cafes.
</P>
<P>
   We crossed the river on the famous Charles Bridge, all abubble
with street musicians, puppeteers, vendors and artists, and entered
the Old Town and its historic and cobbled Old Town Square.
</P>
<P>
   As we marveled over the city's spheres and domes, two thugs were
busily breaking into our station wagon and rifling through our
luggage. &QL; 
___ &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A man and his young son interrupted the thieves and called
police, which no doubt prevented them from wiping us out totally.
As it was, they escaped with suitcases, money, clothes, a tape
recorder, toiletries, books and prescription drugs.
</P>
<P>
   The Czech police and the American Embassy were sympathetic,
although of little help. But it was the purloined drugs that
triggered a bureaucratic nightmare.
</P>
<P>
   After a series of phone calls and e-mails, a friend shipped our
medications from the States to Vienna for delivery to my former
employer, The Associated Press. The medications arrived promptly,
but we never got them. I'll spare you the gory details, but be
assured, and warned, that Austrian Customs officials have few
rivals when it comes to bureaucratic stubbornness.
</P>
<P>
   We fled Prague but spent two more days driving through Czech
towns and villages and allowing Bob to practice his German-flavored
pronunciation on the unsuspecting populace.
</P>
<P>
   We crossed the border into Austria on a Sunday and were speeding
toward Vienna at 110 mph when once again we tumbled into the
clutches of the law.
</P>
<P>
   Bob thought that Austria, like Germany, had no upper speed limit
on the autobahn. He thought that until a motorcyclist dressed in
black, including helmet, goggles and boots, waved us over.
</P>
<P>
   After Bob paid the equivalent of a $45 fine and returned to the
car, Mona asked: ``You think that was a real cop?''
</P>
<P>
   ``Don't know,'' grumbled Bob. ``But his gun was.'' &QL; 
--- &QL;
</P>
<P>
   We caught our first glimpse of the Blue Danube approaching
Passau on the Czech-Austrian border and celebrated at a sidewalk
cafe with wine and nut-encrusted trout. Passau is a prime tourist
destination, the city where the rivers Danube, Inn and Ilz
converge.
</P>
<P>
   The next day, we invaded Hungary, arriving 56 years after the
German occupation and 52 years after the communists seized power.

<P>
   In 1956, the Hungarians rebelled against communist rule, but the
revolt was crushed by Soviet troops. It was not until 1989 that the
Iron Curtain began to lift.
</P>
<P>
   Like the Czech Republic, Hungary is still undergoing tremendous
change, a decade after the lifting of 40 years of Soviet-imposed
communism.
</P>
<P>
   We rolled into Budapest on a Tuesday and wasted no time plunging
into bowls of spicy goulash soup at one of the many sidewalk cafes
hugging the river.
</P>
<P>
   I'm ashamed to admit that it was almost as good as chili.
</P>
<P>
   I'm also ashamed to admit that I did not previously know that
Buda and Pest were two totally different cities separated by the
Danube until the 19th century, when linked by the Chain Bridge.
What emerged was Budapest, the ``Queen of the Danube.''
</P>
<P>
   A bull's-eye, that.
</P>
<P>
   One afternoon, we drove up Gellert Hill on the west side of the
river and, with birds serenading us from the treetops, took in the
magnificent view of the city sprawling below. The architecture is
not only ancient but grand, and among the most famous in Europe.
And in the distance is Margaret Island, a cluster of gardens in the
middle of the Danube.
</P>
<P>
   We left Budapest reluctantly and all too soon, but the cooler
Hungarian lake resort of Balaton beckoned, and beyond that a
whirlwind tour of Austria, the crossroads of modern Europe.
</P>
<P>
   I have seen little to rival the grandeur of the Austrian Alps
and the breathtaking beauty of the mountains, lakes, rivers and
forests east of Salzburg. We spent three unforgettable days in the
latter, at a charming lakeside village called St. Wolfgang.
</P>
<P>
   From the balcony of our hotel on the water, we watched two
golden-orange sunsets, one moonrise and an unexpected, late-night
fireworks display that lit up the lake and startled our new
friends, a pair of snow-white swans.
</P>
<P>
   The idyllic little hamlet provided a perfect, peaceful ending to
a frenetic three-week excursion. The toppling of the Iron Curtain
did indeed open the once-hostile borders to free and easy access,
richly enhancing the European experience, not only for foreigners
but visitors from sister countries, as well. With stormy but
storybook histories and ancient architecture, the two river cities
of Prague and Budapest are among the most exquisite and exciting in
the world.
</P>
<P>
   Because of morning flights, we spent our final night on the
outskirts of Frankfurt, researching for the last time the hops and
grapes of Europe. We pronounced them universally excellent. Over
nightcaps at an intimate little Italian cafe, the four worn-out,
semi-Ugly Americans also agreed to return one day for a similar
European escapade.
</P>
<P>
   One, we vowed, without cops, robbers and Customs.

`WITHOUT LYING DOWN': WOMEN WIELDING POWER IN A WIDE-OPEN
HOLLYWOOD 
</HEADLINE>
  (Eds: Broadcast notes at end of review) 
 By JULIE SALAMON    
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   It's great that Turner Classics Movies has revived many rare old
films that were written, directed or produced by women for its
Women Film Pioneers series. So I'll take it as a backhanded
compliment to women (and interested men, of course) that the cable
network is broadcasting many of these 37 films in the middle of the
night. Someone must be assuming that all of us know how to program
our VCRs.
</P>
<P>
   The five-week-long series begins, however, in prime time, with
an 8 p.m. premiere of a documentary called ``Without Lying Down,''
based on Cari Beauchamp's insightful book about the screenwriter
Frances Marion and other powerful women in early Hollywood.
Beauchamp also produced and wrote this spirited piece of work with
Bridget Terry, and it will be immediately followed by an overnight
retrospective of Marion's films.
</P>
<P>
   Without being sentimental or star-struck, Thursday night's
documentary evokes a comparatively innocent Hollywood after the
turn of the century, when movies became the lodestone for writers
and actors. Women quickly filled the ranks _ before people figured
out how much money there was to be made in the business. Almost
half the screenwriters were women, and they weren't relegated to
``women's pictures.'' Bess Meredyth was co-screenwriter of the
original ``Ben-Hur.'' Lois Weber, a successful director, ran her
own production company.
</P>
<P>
   This was the world that drew Frances Owens, a young woman from a
good San Francisco family who had worked as a photographer's model
but had larger ambitions. She headed for Hollywood, sketchbook in
hand, and was drawing in a park when the vaudeville star Marie
Dressler came by. They had met before, in San Francisco, so it
wasn't entirely strange for Dressler to stop and urge Owens to jump
into the ``cement mixer'' of the movie business.
</P>
<P>
   Owens, who soon became Frances Marion during a brief acting
career, would have jumped anyway. The woman portrayed in this
documentary was adventuresome and extremely talented. She would
write the screenplays for more than 150 movies during her career,
direct, act and become one of the first women correspondents to go
overseas during World War I.
</P>
<P>
   She was also loyal. When talking pictures arrived, she
discovered that her old friend Dressler, who had become a silent
movie star, had been dismissed as obsolete and was about to take a
job as a housekeeper. By then, Owens-Marion had become one of
Hollywood's most prominent screenwriters, assigned to adapt ``Anna
Christie'' for Greta Garbo. She wrote a part for her old friend
Dressler, whose career was revived in the medium's new incarnation.
</P>
<P>
   The documentary deftly uses the Frances Marion story to
illuminate how she and other women were able to capitalize on the
freewheeling creativity that kept the movie business humming in the
early years. It helps that this prolific writer left behind plenty
of commentary, which the actress Kathy Bates reads with a strong,
bright voice, evoking real feeling for Marion and her vigorous
outlook.
</P>
<P>
   The women helped one another. Marion was the host of weekly
parties for Hollywood's female producers, writers and actors where
they screened their movies and complained about the business.
Marion briskly described these relationships like this: ``In the
picture business you can spend your life searching for a man to
look up to without lying down.''
</P>
<P>
   Her career was jump-started by her friendship with Mary
Pickford, with whom she collaborated on more than a dozen silent
movies, many of them adaptations of classic children's literature.
It is fascinating to see clips of Pickford, in her 20s,
convincingly playing adolescent girls in movies like ``The Little
Princess'' and ``Pollyanna.''
</P>
<P>
   Apart from its historical interest, the documentary cogently
discusses Marion's screenwriting skill, using a scene from ``The
Scarlet Letter'' starring Lillian Gish to illustrate the challenge
of translating prose into a silent film _ and to make a novel about
Puritans accessible to a Jazz Age audience. Later, when movies had
sound and she was writing ``The Big House,'' her Oscar-winning
screenplay about prison life, Marion toured San Quentin and
listened to the inmates talk. ``My ears became attuned to their
vernacular,'' she reported.
</P>
<P>
   An elderly Jackie Cooper, recalling the part she wrote for him
as a child star in the 1931 film ``The Champ,'' says, ``Everything
was so believable, what this boy had to say.''
</P>
<P>
   Marion's private life had the ingredients for a Hollywood
bio-pic _ with her overseas reporting adventures and her loving but
tragically curtailed marriage to Fred Thomson, who trained to be a
Presbyterian minister but became one of his era's most famous
Hollywood cowboys, until his death at 38. But she was not
self-pitying, even when the business became an industry and women
lost their foothold. Lois Weber, who gave Frances Marion her start
in the business, died so poor that Marion paid for her funeral.
After Marion herself was demoted to script doctor by Louis B.
Mayer, she had the wherewithal to turn to painting and sculpture as
well as other forms of writing.
</P>
<P>
   Modern female filmmakers (including the director Martha Coolidge
and the producer Polly Platt) comment on Marion's craft and legacy,
offering smart analysis but with the earnestness and
self-consciousness of our age. They appreciate and perhaps envy
Frances Marion, who was from a different time, before the industry
hardened, when possibilities seemed endless because it was all new.

<TEXT>
<P>
   Frustrated Web surfers who yell at the computer when they can't
find something online now have a little friend who won't take it
personally.
</P>
<P>
   One Voice Technologies has just released IVAN, a voice-activated
on-screen servant of sorts, which never loses its cool.
</P>
<P>
   IVAN, which stands for Intelligent Voice-Activated Navigator,
appears on the browser screen as a small cartoon character
resembling a smiling globe with skinny legs. (Web surfers not
enamored of such anthropomorphic whimsy can choose to turn off the
visual aspect of the program.) Instead of the traditional Web
point-and-click action, users can simply tell IVAN things like
``Show me the current price of Cisco stock'' or ``I need to buy a
book,'' and the software will present a Web site or a page of
search results that matches the spoken keywords. Although the IVAN
program will not restrict access to any pages, companies that are
partners with One Voice will usually be at the top of the hit list.
</P>
<P>
   Speaking out loud to browse the Web has been possible for a
while. Dragon Systems, a company that makes speech-recognition
software, incorporates a feature into many of its programs,
including Naturally Speaking Preferred, that lets users surf pages
by saying Web addresses out loud. But IVAN will actually interact
with the user and even ask questions it needs more information. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   IVAN, which combines IBM's Via Voice speech recognition software
with complex search strategies and Internet Explorer 5.0, can be
downloaded from the Web free at www.myivan.com or ordered on CD-ROM
from the site. The Windows 95 and 98 version is available now, with
a Macintosh edition in the works. With all its features, IVAN is
not quick to download _ the full version is more than 100
megabytes, and the program has some demanding minimum system
requirements: a Pentium-level 233-megahertz processor, a headset
microphone, 48 megabytes of RAM and almost 300 megabytes of hard
drive space. It may be a big chunk of digital real estate, but just
think of it as the butler's room on your computer. _ J.D.

   Palm Inc. has announced its new celebrity-endorsed PDA. And what
public intellectual did the company choose for this honor? Was it
Stephen Hawking? No. Stephen Jay Gould? Close. The Palm Vx Claudia
Schiffer Edition, named after the German runway model and actress,
will go on sale in time in the fall. Buyers may also want to
download www.utilware.com/mirror.html, which is free. It turns the
Palm screen into a handy mirror.  &QL; 
Software Tells Wireless E-Mail To Please Get to the Point
</P>
<P>
   Long e-mail messages are rarely welcome by busy computer users.
But they can be almost unbearable when viewed through the tiny
screens of wireless gadgets.
</P>
<P>
   AmikaNow, a Canadian software company, now offers a service that
it says will automatically extract only the most important
sentences before passing them on to a wireless device.
</P>
<P>
   ``People want e-mail highlights,'' said Suhayya Abu-Hakim, the
company's president and chief executive. AmikaFreedom.com is a
Web-based variation of software the company has been selling for
about a year.
</P>
<P>
   To use it, users must fill out a long registration form to
indicate, among other things, the address of their main e-mail
servers. AmikaNow's servers copy e-mail messages as they arrive at
customers' main mail servers. The software then does the chopping,
first by selecting the most important sentences, then by further
reducing them.
</P>
<P>
   The software is largely based on artificial intelligence
research by Abu-Hakim at the Canadian government's National
Research Council.
</P>
<P>
   Not all the decisions about cuts are made using complex
algorithms. The first sentence is usually the first to go,
Abu-Hakim said, because ``a lot of people begin e-mails with some
nicety like `it was good to see you again.'''
</P>
<P>
   By the company's estimate, the software has a success rate of 75
percent to 80 percent. That is partly because of the current
software's limitations, Abu-Hakim acknowledged.
</P>
<P>
   But she said there was another important factor: ``Not everyone
writes well. In the case where the e-mail makes no sense and the
writing is poor, the highlight is going to be poor.''
</P>
<P>
   The service is currently free as it is still in development.
Abu-Hakim said the company planned to start charging users $2 to $5
a month for the service by the end of the year. _ IAN AUSTEN &QR; 
Your Car Can Double as a Paid Advertisement
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   If you thought that the surface of every public space _
including stadium walls, shopping carts and airplane seats _ had
already been appropriated for advertising, you were mistaken. A
company called AutoWraps has found yet another canvas that until
recently was untouched by commercialization: your car.
</P>
<P>
   More than 30,000 people have signed up for the privilege of
having their cars used as rolling advertisements, said Daniel
Shifrin, president of the company. Those who are selected receive
payments of $100 to $400 a month, depending on how much of the car
is covered.
</P>
<P>
   The cars are wrapped in a vinyl adhesive that is guaranteed not
to damage the paint when removed. Many of the cars are also
equipped with a Global Positioning System unit that tracks speed
limits and driving patterns. Applicants must fill out a three-page
registration form on the Web, at www.autowraps.com.
</P>
<P>
   Advertisers use a password-protected section of the site to find
the cars they want to wrap, searching on specifics like the age of
the drivers, where they work and which highways they travel.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is commercialization of just about every free space that
there is,'' said Mary Houser, director of communications for Scenic
America, a lobbying group that fights what it calls billboard
blight. ``There are some people who don't like living in one huge
advertisement.'' _ LISA GUERNSEY
</P>
<P>
   New Rewritable Drive Offers Relief From the Slow Burn
</P>
<P>
   Until recently, computer users measured out their lives in
downloading times. Now there's an even slower, more agonizing
measurement of time discovered by those who copy or create their
own CD's: burning time.
</P>
<P>
   Most CD-rewritable drives copy data at a ratio of about eight to
one, meaning that they can record about 60 minutes of music (or 545
megabytes of data) onto a compact disc in about 7{ minutes. The new
veloCD (pronounced ``velocity'') burner from TDK can record 60
minutes' worth of music in about five minutes, a big difference for
those who are already late for the party.
</P>
<P>
   Those speeds refer only to write-once discs (CD-R). Copying data
onto rewritable discs (CD-RW), an increasingly popular option for
people who want to back up their data, is slightly slower, although
the veloCD still copies data on a rewritable disc in about half the
usual time.
</P>
<P>
   But you'll pay for that higher gear. The suggested retail price
for the PC-compatible internal burner is $399, which is more
expensive than many similar devices. To achieve full speed, it's
also necessary to use TDK's high-speed discs, which run about $4.99
each, more than twice the price of most generic rewritable discs.
The veloCD also comes with music management software and
Burn-Proof, a licensed technology that allows users to open other
applications on the computer while information is being copied.

figuring out how not to get along with people. But somehow George
W. Bush, the gregarious one, and Bob Bullock, who thrived on
closed-door confrontation, became fast friends. Thursday night, in
the kind of bipartisan symbol coveted by the Bush presidential
campaign and more poignant to Texans that the rest of the country

   CVN-MONEY _ PHILADELPHIA _ Rep. Mike Fasano is one of Florida's
80 alternate delegates here, but as of Wednesday he still had not
stepped foot onto the convention floor. That's because Fasano, who
is coordinating his party's House campaigns, has been spending his

If you've been outside lately, where the temperature's been boiling

 &HT;    BUSH CONFIDENT ON EVE OF KEY SPEECH950&AMP;trim.By JENA HEATH
 &HT;    c.2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHILADELPHIA _ He is more comfortable with a wink and a nod than
he is with impassioned oratory, but Gov. George W. Bush will step
onto the stage Thursday night at the Republican National Convention
and deliver the most important speech of his political career.
</P>
<P>
   Designed to unite the GOP and light a fire under the crucial
swing voters Bush is battling Vice President Al Gore to win over,
the 3,900-word address, about 30 minutes long without interruption,
will introduce Bush to a nation that still doesn't know him nearly
as well as Texas does.
</P>
<P>
   ``It will be watched by millions of Americans who really get
their first chance to size up George W. Bush,'' said Scott Reed,
who managed former Sen. Bob Dole's 1996 White House race. ``He
really needs to round out who he is, where he's from and where he's
heading in one national speech.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush told an audience at a Republican National Committee
fund-raising gala Wednesday, ``the first thing I'm going to do is
share with America how proud I am and how much I love my parents.''
</P>
<P>
   He joked, too, that, ``a crowd this big makes me want to go
through the whole speech,'' but his campaign has jealously guarded
its contents, only hinting at what he might say.
</P>
<P>
   The overall theme _ that the nation, poised at a moment of peace
and prosperity, is free to take on some thorny problems _ echoes
his stump speech.
</P>
<P>
   Bush will talk about tax cuts, Social Security, strengthening
the military and education _ the four pillars of his campaign. He
is also likely to talk about prescription drug coverage for the
elderly, a relatively new campaign theme and one that polls show
plays well with voters.
</P>
<P>
   Hughes said Bush will also emphasize his by-now familiar theme
of bringing honor and dignity to the White House. And while he will
contrast his proposals and philosophy with the Clinton
administration's, Bush won't make sweeping attacks.
</P>
<P>
   He won't point out, as he has for days on the campaign trail,
that running mate Dick Cheney knows what the meaning of the word
``is'' is _ a not-so-thinly veiled reference to the Monica Lewinsky
scandal.
</P>
<P>
   Bush has also begun working a new line into his stump speech, on
e that will perhaps appear Thursday night. He tells audiences that
Americans want ``somebody who appeals to their better angels, not
their darker impulses,'' and that he and Cheney will fulfill that
desire.
</P>
<P>
   Communications director Karen Hughes said this week that Bush
will ``needle his opponents a little,'' but she describes the text
as ``a positive speech ... an uplifting speech.''
</P>
<P>
   Reed said Bush must both rally the GOP and appeal to key swing
voters.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of the emphasis of the speech should be focused on
independents, swing suburban women in the Midwest, because that's
where this whole election will be won or lost,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The speech has been in the works since mid-May, when Bush
huddled in the library of the Governor's Mansion in Austin with
chief speechwriter Mike Gerson, campaign strategist Karl Rove,
Hughes, media adviser Mark McKinnon and policy director Josh
Bolten.
</P>
<P>
   Gerson, 36, who worked as a speechwriter in Dole's 1996 White
House race, has largely crafted Bush's address, submitting at least
16 drafts for his review. Only a handful of insiders have seen the
speech.
</P>
<P>
   (Begin optional trim)
</P>
<P>
   That's not unusual.
</P>
<P>
   Besides, his wife, Elizabeth, and a small speechwriting team,
Dole shared his convention address with five people: former
President Bush, conservative commentator and author William F.
Buckley, former House Speaker Newt Gingrich, retired Gen. Colin L.
Powell and Haley Barbour, then chairman of the Republican National
Committee.
</P>
<P>
   ``He chose them for all different reasons,'' said John Buckley,
who oversaw Dole's speechwriting team and also reviewed the speech.
``He chose George Bush Sr. because he was the last person to have
delivered a Republican nomination speech, and he wanted his
opinion.''
</P>
<P>
   Dole asked Powell if he would review the speech during a flight
the two shared, Buckley said.
</P>
<P>
   And Dole worked with a coach and spent the four weeks before he
delivered the speech practicing at the podium. The work paid off.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is notable that the only time in the entire political year
in 1996 that Bob Dole was within five points of President Clinton
was the morning after his speech because he did succeed,'' Buckley
said. ``People viewed him as a potential president.''
</P>
<P>
   (End optional trim)
</P>
<P>
   Bush tinkered with the speech _ and practiced it aloud for small
private audiences of friends and colleagues _ during the five-day
pre-convention tour through the swing states of Arkansas, Missouri,
Kentucky, Ohio and West Virginia.
</P>
<P>
   He told reporters aboard his campaign plane Wednesday morning
that the speech is ``done, ready to go.'' Earlier, Bush said he
hopes the speech will tell the American people that he is ``a
decisive, firm leader who's got good judgment and is ready to lead
the nation.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush first read the speech aloud on July 21 at his ranch near
Crawford, Texas, behind a podium set up in an exercise room and
with his inner circle seated on the floor.
</P>
<P>
   He has been through four full practices since _ two in Austin,
one recently at the Cincinnati home of longtime friends Bill and
Kathie DeWitt, and one on Tuesday in a large room on the first
floor of the Governor's Mansion in Pennsylvania. He said Wednesday
morning that he had not decided if he would practice again.
</P>
<P>
   Media adviser Stuart Stevens watched the Tuesday rehearsal. So
did Gov. Tom Ridge, whom Bush vetted as a possible running mate and
who will be one of the people introducing Bush tonight. Stevens
said Ridge's 11-year-old son, Tommy, was also there, along with
Hughes and Bush's personal assistant.
</P>
<P>
   Just back from speaking at a rally of some 5,000 people, Bush
changed into casual clothes, including a Texas Rangers T-shirt,
stood behind a podium and delivered the speech using a TelePrompter
and with background crowd noise that Stevens had on a compact disk.
</P>
<P>
   He has used the TelePrompter at least twice. Stevens said Bush
did just fine.
</P>
<P>
   ``He'd just gone through that big speech at the rally,'' he
said. ``It was like having a guy pitch batting practice after
already having a game. He was relaxed.''
</P>
<P>
   Buckley said Bush, like any other nominee, will need to convince
voters that ``this is somebody who they are comfortable with in
their living rooms on television for the next four years.''
</P>
<P>
   Reed credits the campaign with using the past three months to
firmly advance Bush's policy agenda and the last five days to set
the stage for his biggest performance ever.
</P>
<P>
   ``They have very effectively had a positive lead-up to the
convention,'' he said. ``He's been in the hall every night via
satellite rolling out the beginning of his message. But it all
culminates tonight.''

<P>
   They slouch into chairs, faces rumpled and downcast, a sluggish
clot of high school juniors in Gonzaga Prep's 8 a.m. religion
class. Members of a generation stuffed with Pokemon and Simpsons
reruns, they are about to get their daily dose of Roman Catholic
Church history, focusing today on the eighth century.
</P>
<P>
   The bell rings. The day begins with a quick prayer, followed by
individual pleas on behalf of a hospitalized sibling and the track
team. Shuffle, shuffle, cough, cough. And then class gets under
way, run by the rarest kind of teacher in a U.S. Catholic school at
the dawn of the new century: a priest.
</P>
<P>
   I look around for familiar signs from my days at this very
school 27 years ago. The most startling thing is the presence of
girls. Gonzaga was an all-boys institution until two years after I
left. Young Catholic men would not be able to learn Latin or the
history of the Peloponnesian War with the distraction of girls, the
thinking went.
</P>
<P>
   The hack paddle _ nearly three feet of solid oak, an inch thick
and perforated for maximum pain delivery _ is long gone. On several
occasions, I was sent down to the office of a 240-pound,
chain-smoking Irish-American priest who made me bend over and
understand what a baseball feels like when it's hit by Mark
McGwire. Gone, also, is Rockpile, the after-school cleanup detail
for the discipline-challenged.
</P>
<P>
   On the wall today, I spot the two icons held up for veneration
from my earliest days at school: the first Roman Catholic
President, John F. Kennedy, and the crucifix.
</P>
<P>
   ``In 756, Pepin defeats the Lombards and gives control of
central Italy to the pope,'' says the Rev. Tom Lamanna, a young
Jesuit, who has never strayed far from his roots here in his
hometown, Spokane, Wash. ``What this does is eat away at spiritual
authority. Popes and bishops shouldn't be involved in this sort of
stuff.''
</P>
<P>
   There is no religion by rote for these 17-year-olds, no
word-for-word rehash of doctrine. Lamanna, one of the few priests
in the nation teaching at a Catholic school, is suggesting that
conversion by sword was not such a great idea.
</P>
<P>
   A student raises her hand to ask a question, and Lamanna's face
brightens. ``Is this going to be on the quiz?'' the student asks.
The important things never change.
</P>
<P>
   Nearly 10 years after many educators had written them off for
dead, Roman Catholic schools in the United States are in the midst
of an extraordinary revival. Enrollment is up across the nation.
Hundreds of new schools have opened. And more than 40 percent of
all Catholic elementary and secondary schools have waiting lists
for admission.
</P>
<P>
   More remarkably, Catholic schools, once staffed primarily by
nuns, priests and brothers from various religious orders, are
nearly devoid of clerics _ reflecting the crash of vocations in the
last 25 years as priests have become more urgently needed in the
parishes. In the nation's Catholic schools, priests account for
fewer than 1 percent of the 157,000 teachers. Ninety-three percent
of the teachers are laity, while nuns make up 5.5 percent and
brothers less than 1 percent.
</P>
<P>
   There are 10,000 fewer priests now than there were 25 years ago.
And the ranks will continue to shrink: nearly one-fourth of the
nation's 47,000 Catholic priests are over the age of 70.
</P>
<P>
   Schools that were once Dominican or Franciscan now speak of
being in the Dominican or Franciscan ``tradition.'' Gone are the
days when virtually every Catholic parish in the country supported
a teaching staff of nuns or priests living year-round near the
school grounds, laboring for compensation well below the poverty
line.
</P>
<P>
   As the Roman collars and the black-and-white habits have
disappeared from the halls, so too, has the overwhelmingly Catholic
makeup of the typical student body. A record 13.4 percent of the
2.6 million students are non-Catholic _ more than four times the
percentage of 30 years ago.
</P>
<P>
   And in many of the old industrial cities where immigration led
to a flowering of Catholic schools in the 1880s, a majority of the
students at some schools named for saints and holy days are not
Catholic. In Lower Manhattan, for example, Buddhists make up a
large segment of the students in two schools, Saint Patrick's Old
Cathedral School and Transfiguration School. Throughout the
Archdiocese of New York, 20 percent of the students are
non-Catholic.
</P>
<P>
   The numbers of non-Catholics could dramatically increase if
various voucher or tax credit proposals, which subsidize private
school education, are enacted in some of the states now considering
them and upheld by the courts. This fall, California will vote on a
voucher program that Catholic educators in the state say could lead
to waiting lists for nearly every Catholic school in the state.
</P>
<P>
   ``With or without vouchers, the problem for us now is not demand
_ it's supply,'' said Leonard DeFiore president of the National
Catholic Education Association.
</P>
<P>
   All of which raises a basic question: How can Catholic schools
be flourishing, yet still maintain their religious identity when so
many of the teachers and students have no formal attachment to the
religion whose imprint is on the school? In some schools, the
Catholicism seems almost an after-thought. With no way to measure
whether they have moved students to look at the world through a
spiritual lens, Catholic educators shrug and speak of anecdotal
triumphs, of students who may have picked up a habit of daily
prayer to go with high College Board scores. It is a long way from
the glory days of post-war Catholic schools, an era that seems as
distant as Pepin and the Lombards.
</P>
<P>
   As Lamanna said after his religion class: ``The kids I teach are
a lot less churched than their parents were. And we have
fundamentalists, Muslims, even an occasional Jewish student.''
</P>
<P>
   I returned to Gonzaga and also visited other schools, trying to
get a sense of what a Catholic education is like today. The one
thing I heard repeatedly was that, if anything, the schools are
more consciously Catholic now than they were a generation ago.
Without nuns or priests to guide students, principals have tried to
institutionalize Catholic education _ a tough act for the spiritual
aspects. It is one thing to require all students to study theology,
go on retreats and attend Mass four times a year _ as most Catholic
secondary schools do. What is more difficult is putting down the
cultural imprint.

</P>
<P>
   In ``Hollow Man,'' Kevin Bacon plays the kind of scientific
genius who wears periwinkle shirts with purple ties, drives a
Porsche convertible with its stereo blasting, and struts like a
rooster in a coop full of hens.
</P>
<P>
   His second-in-command on a top-secret government project is the
head hen _ his former squeeze, played by Elisabeth Shue with a
suggestive swivel and a wide-eyed, adoring gaze.
</P>
<P>
   Her current beau is dreamboat researcher Josh Brolin though
she's trying to keep it quiet because Bacon, who wants her back,
already considers him a professional rival.
</P>
<P>
   The movie, in other words, treats its high-level Pentagon
research lab as if it were high school, with all the sexual heat,
petty jealousies and wounded pride that implies. The team also
includes four other youngish though less-gorgeous members. They
celebrate breakthroughs with high fives, loud whoops and pumping
fists, as if they were at a hockey game.
</P>
<P>
   Any audience that can take this rock 'n' roll crew seriously as
scientists won't have any problem with the rest of the movie, which
adds adrenal overkill and a high-tech, digital gloss to the kind of
monster-within plot you'll remember from black-and-white horror
movies of the '30s.
</P>
<P>
   Sebastian Caine (Bacon) is the hollow man. The movie makes it
clear that he was lacking something _ a conscience? a moral center?
_ even before he turns transparent. He's a jerk, out only for glory
and power. He lies. He mistreats lab animals. He cuts corners.
Being invisible only gives him the license to act on his desires.
</P>
<P>
   He wants to be the first invisible man so badly that he's not
above injecting himself with invisibility serum before he's
finished testing the antidote. He becomes instantly enraptured with
his power to do mischief.
</P>
<P>
   He spies on people, gropes co-workers and plays silly games.
This soon escalates. As he tells himself before he sneaks with evil
intent into the apartment of a beautiful neighbor he's long lusted
after: ``Who's going to know?''
</P>
<P>
   Bacon is terrifically venal. He gives the kind of performance
that people would praise as courageous if he were Tom Cruise or
Harrison Ford _ stars who think audiences only want to see them as
heroes. Bacon long ago defined himself (or got defined) as an actor
rather than star. With his easy sneer, licentious moves and
exaggerated tough-guy swagger, he's a natural heavy.
</P>
<P>
   The special effects here really are special. When invisible
creatures receive the antidote, we watch first their veins, then
their hearts, then lungs turn visible. Organ by organ, they come
into view. Trapped between visible and invisible, Bacon spends part
of the movie looking like a moving, lifesize drawing from a medical
textbook.
</P>
<P>
   Among this movie's problems is that it ventures too far out of
the realm of metaphor into horror movie cliches. It isn't enough
that Caine behaves like a monster; he turns into a creature along
the lines of the shape-shifting android in the second
``Terminator'' movie _ he will not be stopped.
</P>
<P>
   Set him on fire, bash him over the head with a pipe, electrocute
him _ he comes back for more. He has more lives than the invisible
cat we see rip apart a rat in the movie's first scene. It makes for
exciting action and chase sequences _ director Paul Verhoeven knows
how to push the right buttons _ but button-pushing is all it is.
</P>
<P>
   Just when you think the movie's over and you can rest easy, a
hand juts clawlike onto the screen. These rising, sequential
climaxes have become so predictable in horror films, you can almost
set your watch by the monster's resurrections.
</P>
<P>
   A major difference between ``Hollow Man'' and B movies of yore
is that the heroic character who saves the day is a woman.
</P>
<P>
   Yes, Shue gets top billing, though for the first half of the
movie her character, Linda McKay, spends a lot of time standing
behind Bacon's Caine, looking on admiringly, watching the genius at
work. She also does a lot of heavy breathing, the better to show
she's more than a little tempted when he puts the moves on her.
</P>
<P>
   As if to telegraph, though, that she will become a
larger-than-life heroine before the proceedings are through, she's
given to outsized gestures. She strides into a room more like
Wonder Woman than Lois Lane. She's silently shouting ``Look at me''
over Bacon's shoulder in each of those early scenes.
</P>
<P>
   But by the end, she no longer has to shout. With her quick wits
and stamina, she steps to the fore, and we'd watch her even if
Bacon weren't invisible. &QL;

 UNDATED: cultural imprint. 
<TEXT>
<P>
   At age 7, I walked into first grade at Assumption of the Blessed
Virgin Mary elementary school in Spokane and was confronted by an
enormous poster depicting the fall of Adam and Eve in the Garden of
Eden. Our school was blue-collar, the second- and third-generation
Irish and Italian children from huge families. We had nine in ours,
but could not compete with the Flynns, down the street, who had 13,
or the Phillipses, who had 19.
</P>
<P>
   Every teacher but one was a sister. The nuns were mysterious,
all but the front of their faces veiled by the habit. We called
them penguins, not always a pejorative.
</P>
<P>
   We all knew who the handful of non-Catholics at the school were.
And if we walked down the street and came to a Protestant church,
we crossed to the other side, as we were taught.
</P>
<P>
   Religion was part of everything; even math and science lessons
usually got around to the divine magnificence of the universe. John
F. Kennedy's picture was in every classroom, and Notre Dame
football was the sports extension of the church.
</P>
<P>
   Religion class, at first, was the Baltimore Catechism, starting
with the basic questions: Who made me? God made me. Why did God
make me? To know, love and serve him on this earth. It was memory,
nothing more. And everything that could not be adequately explained
was referred to as a mystery, as the comedian George Carlin later
recalled.
</P>
<P>
   Then came the Second Vatican Council, in the mid-1960s, which
brought the Catholic Church into the modern age. And before long
the nuns were showing some hair and lower leg, and plugging in
electric guitars at Masses that were celebrated in English, not
Latin.
</P>
<P>
   The era of Catholic schools in the United States dates to 1884,
when the bishops, responding to complaints about Protestant
domination of public schools, ordered every parish to build a
school. Waves of mostly poor, immigrant children were educated at
these schools, which engendered a backlash. The most extreme bias
came in Oregon, in the 1920s, when the Ku Klux Klan helped pass a
law _ later thrown out in court _ that banned children from going
to Catholic schools.
</P>
<P>
   At the peak of enrollment, in 1964 _ I was in the third grade _
more than 5.6 million students attended 13,000 Catholic elementary
and secondary schools. Of course, the numbers reflected the surge
of baby boomers, but it was also a time when there were sufficient
nuns and priests to run the schools.
</P>
<P>
   Tuition was nearly free, in part because of support from church
members and dioceses, but also because the schools could depend on
an army of cheap labor, with nearly everyone from the principal on
down living under a vow of poverty. Now there is but a single nun
at Assumption.
</P>
<P>
   Tuition at Assumption is $3,000 a year _ cheap by the standards
of most private schools, but higher than the national average for
Catholic elementary schools, which is $1,800. And it is flexible. A
family pays what it can afford. Nationwide, because so many
students are given tuition breaks, Catholic schools face perennial
budget crunches _ except in wealthy suburban districts.
</P>
<P>
   My niece, Lindsey Egan, is a seventh grader at Assumption, and
she loves it, speaking enthusiastically of the sports, a cocoon of
good friends and the challenge of two hours of nightly homework. I
doubted she loved that part.
</P>
<P>
   What about religion? ``Oh, sure, that part's OK We go to Mass
almost every week.'' No mysteries. No Gothic punishment. She seemed
untouched by the load that many students of my vintage are still
trying to sort through, and had no concern about who was Catholic
and who was not.
</P>
<P>
   The lone nun is revered. There is a waiting list to get in. And
the students outperform children in the Spokane public schools. The
poster of Adam and Eve has disappeared. Mysteries are explained by
science. But the children still wear uniforms.
</P>
<P>
   When I entered high school, there were 47 Jesuits at Gonzaga,
many with advanced degrees. The older priests tended to be
rock-jawed and thick-armed; some were World War II veterans who had
gone into the priesthood after the horror of the war. The priests
were rarely out of clerical garb, whether they were shoveling snow,
rewiring an electrical panel or showing the baseball team how to
hit a fastball.
</P>
<P>
   We deconstructed the rock opera ``Tommy,'' by The Who, in
sophomore religion class. By my senior year, we had vigorous
debates that spilled into evening arguments over the very existence
of God. The Jesuits did not want us to believe in church teachings
just because they told us to; they wanted us to arrive there by
intellectual deduction, reason and _ failing all that _ simple
faith.
</P>
<P>
   We read ``Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man'' by James Joyce
and ``Catcher in the Rye'' by J.D. Salinger and ``The Invisible
Man'' by Ralph Ellison _ all prompting some parents to complain,
but the Jesuits held firm.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you take nothing else away from here, remember the lesson
of Moby Dick,'' said my senior English teacher. ``Be in constant
search of your God and your self.''
</P>
<P>
   This year, on my return, I asked the principal of Gonzaga, Al
Falkner, if the Moby Dick moral still applied. A former English
teacher who has been at the school for 26 years and sent all four
of his children there, Falkner said yes, but that the school was
trying to impart other lessons as well.
</P>
<P>
   Of the nearly 1,000 students at the school, about 20 percent are
non-Catholics. Only two of the 65 teachers are Jesuit priests, a
ratio similar to that at the nation's 45 other Jesuit high schools.
Yet, Falkner says, ``We are more Jesuit now than we were 40 years
ago.''

ANTI-VIOLENCE STRIKES BY OPPOSITION CHALLENGE MUGABE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By KURT SHILLINGER  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   JOHANNESBURG _ President Robert Mugabe's foes, bolstered by
their gains in elections in June, shut down Zimbabwe's hobbled
economy Wednesday in a nationwide strike to protest
government-sponsored violence.
</P>
<P>
   The work stoppage, the broadest such action in two decades,
confirmed the arrival of a new era of grass-roots activism against
the corruption, thuggery, and economic mismanagement that critics
say have become hallmarks of Mugabe's rule. Shop lathes and field
tractors sat idle through cities and rural districts as workers and
farmers demonstrated their opposition to the illegal occupation of
commercial farms by Mugabe's supporters and the government's
unexplained deployment of elite military forces in urban townships.
</P>
<P>
   Mugabe, meeting with visiting South African President Thabo
Mbeki to discuss Zimbabwe's economic crisis, made no comment about
the labor stoppage. Other government officials shrugged off the
action, claiming that factory bosses and farmers forced their
workers off the job.
</P>
<P>
   But independent observers said that widespread participation _
trade-union leaders estimated up to 90 percent of workers laid down
their tools _ underscored the depth of dissatisfaction with
Mugabe's rule, even among his traditional supporters.
</P>
<P>
   ``The opposition is on to something very powerful,'' said John
Robertson, an economist based in Harare, the capital. Expelling
Mugabe ``won't be quick, but the people are sending a message to
the government: Their patience has reached the limit.''
</P>
<P>
   The strike came one day after the government announced a
long-delayed devaluation of Zimbabwe's currency, from 38 ZimDollars
to 50 against the US dollar.
</P>
<P>
   The Zimbabwe Congress of Trade Unions, acting in concert with
the predominantly white Commercial Farmers' Union and the
opposition Movement for Democratic Change, called the strike to
protest widespread political intimidation. Zimbabwe's current
season of fear started six months ago when pro-government thugs,
led by veterans of the 1970s liberation war against colonialism,
began seizing white-owned farms.
</P>
<P>
   Courts ruled the invasions illegal, but Mugabe encouraged the
land grab, saying it was justified by the racial imbalance left
over from colonial days. Two decades after independence, some 4,000
whites own much of the country's most arable land, while the black
rural masses remain impoverished.
</P>
<P>
   More than 1,300 farms were invaded and 31 people died in
political violence ahead of the June vote. Hopes that the violence
would end with the election were quickly dashed when Mugabe,
smarting from his party's first serious losses, deployed his elite
Presidential Guard into high-density urban suburbs _ strongholds of
the opposition. The government has never explained the move, but
incidents of intimidation, including beatings, occur daily.
</P>
<P>
   Labor and farming leaders vow to continue pressuring the
government until the troops are called back to their barracks and
the squatters leave the farms.
</P>
<P>
   The opposition, meanwhile, has begun testing its leverage in
parliament. The Movement for Democratic Change, which took nearly
half of the elected seats in parliament, is contesting at least 31
seats and demanding the government reestablish the rule of law and
address corruption.
</P>
<P>
   A survey by the University of Zimbabwe showed that 47 of the 62
elected members of parliament from Mugabe's party have been
implicated in corruption scandals and face possible investigation.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are totally challenging Mugabe's mandate to rule,'' said
Morgan Tsvangirai, the MDC leader. ``Mugabe only has two options:
Step down or use violence. We cannot afford this anarchy that is
disrupting the economy.''

 UNDATED: 40 years ago.'' 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Lay principals at other Catholic schools said somewhat the same
thing. It seemed incongruent. But after Catholic schools hit bottom
in the late 1980s, when many of them were adrift and uncertain as
to how to operate without priests or nuns, there was a concerted
effort to institutionalize the education for a new era.
</P>
<P>
   At Gonzaga, the lay staff is required to stay within the bounds
of Jesuit teaching principles, something the priests would not
always do. The fathers were assumed, by virtue of their vocations,
to be strong adherents of an order that values deductive logic and
reason in the classroom. But in practice, many Jesuits were simply
bad teachers, say some of the older priests.
</P>
<P>
   Falkner produced an instruction manual that every teacher is
required to follow. It details a number of teaching techniques
intended to make sure students understand certain principles. They
teach reflection _ ``a real challenge in math,'' said Falkner _ and
action, which usually takes the form of community service. The term
``social justice'' is used a lot. Grades count, of course; 96
percent of Gonzaga graduates go on to college. But the intention is
for students to have an epiphany of the spirit as well, an outcome
that is not easily manufactured, no matter how it is prescribed in
the teacher's manual.
</P>
<P>
   ``In every classroom, there should be a moment of truth when you
experience God,'' Falkner said. ``It may be the point where, all of
a sudden, you realize what Huck Finn is dealing with in that
book.''
</P>
<P>
   In the hallways, I bumped into the Rev. Robert A. Goebel, who
took over the hack paddle in my sophomore year. He is 74, still
wiry, with a full head of hair, and now works primarily with
alumni. I brought up those painful hacks he used to give me on my
rear end.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was good for you,'' he said with a laugh. ``And you know
it.'' In truth, I was not sure. I did not resent the priests for
corporal punishment of a kind that would probably bring a lawsuit
today. Twice, I talked my way out of hacks, which is a backhanded
way of saying I learned something, even if it was not the intended
lesson. I asked him how it felt to be one of the few priests left
at a school he has been associated with since 1957, and whether
Gonzaga had changed for better or worse.
</P>
<P>
   ``It may be for the better,'' said Goebel. ``Because you wore a
collar, you were supposed to be able to teach. But a lot of the
priests from my generation were not very good teachers. Everyone
assumed that just because they were priests, they could provide a
good Catholic education.''
</P>
<P>
   He recalled the full-service life, the teaching that never
ended. ``I can remember teaching kids how to blow their nose in a
proper way, and how to open a bottle of Champagne and not have it
spill on you,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Goebel's much younger colleague, Lamanna, lives in an apartment
a few blocks from the school. Handkerchief etiquette and the
intricacies of cork removal are not among his duties.
</P>
<P>
   As at Assumption, the students at Gonzaga seem to be in awe of
the rare priest or nun.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is the first time I've ever had a priest teach me,'' said
Jessie Serghin, a junior in the church history class at Gonzaga.
``He's awesome.'' She was less enthusiastic about the story of
Pepin and the Lombards that Lamanna was trying to impart. ``Some of
this is probably not relevant to our lives,'' she said. ``But
that's OK''
</P>
<P>
   The students at Gonzaga _ like those at most Catholic high
schools _ are required to take four semesters of theology:
Scripture, morality, church history and a senior-year elective
usually involving community service. ``We've made a conscious
decision to call it theology, not religion,'' said Lamanna,
explaining that the word of choice is more expansive, less narrow
and dogmatic.
</P>
<P>
   ``One of the biggest challenges I have is teaching Scripture to
the non-Catholics,'' he added. ``Some of them believe every word of
the Bible is literally true.'' He tries to get these students to
see the Bible _ especially the Old Testament _ as allegory and oral
history, not always the literal word of God.
</P>
<P>
   Proselytizing is rare, he said, echoing the comments of
religious order teachers at other Catholic schools. Lamanna is a
spiritual counselor, a role that consists mainly of listening to
the problems of struggling adolescents. ``As a priest, I have
access to their interior life,'' he said. ``That's a very humbling
thing.''
</P>
<P>
   I sought out Jack Delehanty, a drama teacher who has been at the
school since I was a student there. Though 58 years old, he still
looks the way he did to us boys who were making the transition from
sports obsession to noir movies and poetry _ hip in an understated
way. He stages plays, in the school's new 350-seat performing arts
center, that deal with racism, homophobia and misunderstood youth,
as well as crowd-pleasing musicals.
</P>
<P>
   ``The kids have changed,'' Delehanty said. ``We wanted to live
our high school life, have fun, try different things. Now they are
so pressured by the culture to succeed at an early age.''
</P>
<P>
   I asked him if he was a practicing Catholic, and how religion
trickled through the drama class curriculum. ``My faith is
Catholic, but my approach is humanistic,'' he said. ``That isn't a
conflict here. In the old days it was do it the Catholic way. It
was doctrine. Now, it's about values.''
</P>
<P>
   No city in the United States has opened the doors of Roman
Catholic schools to taxpayer-subsidized education as has Milwaukee.
Five years ago, the state of Wisconsin allowed poor families in
Milwaukee to send their children to parochial schools, with tuition
reimbursed by taxpayers at up to $5,000 a year per student. It is
the largest voucher program in the country, and has been upheld by
the Wisconsin Supreme Court. The U. S. Supreme Court refused to
hear an appeal of that court's decision. Programs elsewhere have
run up against constitutional questions over separation of church
and state.
</P>
<P>
   In Milwaukee, where about 3,000 students attend Catholic schools
under the voucher program, students may opt out of participation in
religious activities at the schools. But the schools say there has
not been a single such request.

 UNDATED: such request. 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Perhaps the biggest beneficiary in Milwaukee has been Messmer
High School, a clump of Depression-era brick situated near a
freeway in one of the city's poorest neighborhoods. Messmer was
nearly closed in the mid-1980s and disowned by its archdiocese. It
stayed alive with private donations, only to flourish beyond all
expectations with the voucher students. It now has a waiting list.
Catholic educators point to Messmer as an example for Catholic
schools in other poor areas.
</P>
<P>
   ``You don't have to be a Catholic to get a great education at
Messmer High,'' says the school brochure. ``Most students aren't.''
</P>
<P>
   In fact, about 80 percent of the school's 400 students are
non-Catholic. More than half the students are there because of the
voucher program. ``I believe we have reinvented Catholic
education,'' said Jeff Monday, the school principal. ``If we had to
follow the old Catholic model, the church probably would have
closed us down.''
</P>
<P>
   But religion is not hidden. The Ten Commandments are posted in
the entrance. Amid classroom banners that read ``Believe in
Yourself'' are others exhorting students to ``Open Wide the Doors
to Christ.'' The day begins with a prayer.
</P>
<P>
   Tuition is $3,100 a year, and more than 90 percent of the
students cannot afford to pay it. Those who are not on vouchers
receive tuition money from private donations, scholarships and
fund-raisers.
</P>
<P>
   The school dynamo and president is a black Capuchin monk of the
Franciscan order, Brother Bob Smith. Messmer is overwhelmingly
black, and parents describe Smith as a role model.
</P>
<P>
   An easy-to-laugh, personable man with two cell phones by his
side at virtually all times, Smith cheerfully cites the
contradictions of maintaining a Catholic identity at a school where
most people have no attachment to the religion.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're here to give these children a religious foundation,'' he
said. ``Not values.''
</P>
<P>
   Yet he is not an absolutist. ``I don't believe in this thing
that one religion is right and everyone else is wrong.''
</P>
<P>
   At Messmer, students pray every day, go on spiritual retreats,
and attend at least four Masses a year. They take one religion
class every year, five days a week. The school is clean and
remarkably quiet. Even at the end of the day, around 6 p.m.,
students are hanging around, loathe to leave.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are friendly, but we tell students we are not their buddies
or their friends,'' said Smith, who grew up in Chicago and worked
for a time as a parole officer in Detroit. ``And don't even think
of calling a teacher here by their first name.''
</P>
<P>
   Messmer does not cherry-pick the best students, as do some
Catholic high schools; there is no admission test for entry. It has
been, by nearly all accounts, a big success, with 85 percent of the
graduates going on to college _ three times the rate of neighboring
public high schools.
</P>
<P>
   But again, grades are one thing; imparting Catholicism is much
tougher, the teachers say. Smith defined the ultimate goal in terms
remarkably similar to the words used by the Gonzaga principal. ``At
some point in a student's life here we want them to come face to
face with God,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Smith and the other Messmer teacher who belongs to a religious
order, Sister Elayne Hill, are exotic creatures at the school.
</P>
<P>
   ``I tell the students about our vows of poverty and chastity,''
said Smith. ``I tell them that they may have a different pair of
tennis shoes for every day of the week, but I live on less than
$10,000 a year, and don't mind. I say I would love to have kids, a
family of my own. But I have given that up because of my belief.''
</P>
<P>
   Sister Hill does not wear a habit; she is a young, light-skinned
black woman from Washington, D.C. ``I have to explain a lot to the
kids,'' she said with a grin. ``The students say, `You're a nun? A
real nun?' What they are most upset about is chastity. That just
blows their mind.''
</P>
<P>
   I asked her if she taught the concept of heaven, hell and that
in-between destination in the hereafter, purgatory.
</P>
<P>
   ``Yes, there is a heaven and a hell, and we talk about it,'' she
said. ``Purgatory _ um, that's another matter.'' She said her job
was not to convert non-Catholics. ``I'm on a journey with them, an
invitation,'' she said. ``It's not `do this or die.'''
</P>
<P>
   But she worries about the minority of students who are strong
Catholics. ``I do think that the Catholic kids almost get lost at
some of these schools.''
</P>
<P>
   And that may be the ultimate irony in the renaissance of
American Catholic schools: some of the brightest stars _ and
certainly, the fastest-growing schools _ are the ones with the
fewest Catholics.

BUSINESS ACTIVITY SLOWS AS LACK OF WORKERS HITS FIRMS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By KIMBERLY BLANTON  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ Business confidence in Massachusetts slipped for a
second month, according to a survey of companies reporting they
were concerned they could not hire enough workers to expand.
</P>
<P>
   The Associated Industries of Massachusetts reported Wednesday
that its index of future business activity fell in July to 66.9
points, down from 68.1 in June and from a 2 1/2-year high of 68.3
in May. The index is based on a survey of manufacturing and other
companies operating in the state.
</P>
<P>
   While the drop in Massachusetts' business confidence seemed to
bolster a smattering of evidence that the US economy may be cooling
off, Alan Clayton Matthews, professor of economics for the
University of Massachusetts at Boston, said the state's economy is,
in fact, still very strong.
</P>
<P>
   Employment is growing about 2 percent a year, which is
``incredible, given our tight labor market,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, exports are up, and consumer confidence and personal
incomes in New England are high, Matthews said, noting that AIM's
index is still well above levels during all of 1999. A year ago, in
July 1999, the index was 67.9.
</P>
<P>
   ``At the national level, there's a question of whether we're
slowing down or not _ the signals are mixed,'' he said. ``At the
state level, more of the signals are still pointing toward strong
growth.''
</P>
<P>
   AIM spokesman Raymond Torto said companies responding to the
survey reported their sales were softening somewhat. But he
confirmed that the slowdown may, oddly, be a boom-time curse: The
``most-cited constraint on expansion remains the tight labor
market,'' Torto said.
</P>
<P>
   A shortage of workers continues to pressure wages. The US Bureau
of Labor Statistics reported Wednesday the employment cost index of
total compensation _ a measure of wage increase _ surged 0.9
percent in the Northeastern states for the April-to-June quarter, a
drop-off from the 1.4 percent gain the prior quarter.
</P>
<P>
   But wages in the region are rising faster than inflation: the
employment cost index for the 12 months ending in June was 4.3
percent, a full percentage point higher than inflation, the
government said.
</P>
<P>
   AIM's confidence index is biased toward the sentiments of
manufacturers, which make up a large part of its membership. The
survey also included business services, high-tech and other
non-manufacturing concerns. When exports declined in the wake of
Asia's financial meltdown in 1997 and 1998, the index sank. As
manufacturing rebounded, the index hit record highs in the first
quarter of this year.
</P>
<P>
   The worldwide economy may be in for a slowdown in coming months,
according to a separate index of international economic activity,
also released Wednesday. The Economic Cycle Research Institute in
New York said its estimate of global growth rates in coming months
fell to a 3.4 percent annual rate. By comparison, predictions made
six months ago had pegged future growth at 5.3 percent.
</P>
<P>
   ECRI said interest-rate ``tightening moves over the past year by
most central banks around the world'' would cause an international
slowdown.

GETTING THROUGH THOSE EARLY DAYS OF COLLEGE 
</HEADLINE>
  (For release Sunday, August 6) 
(Eds: Glenn C. Altschuler is both the dean of the School of
Continuing Education and Summer Sessions and the Thomas and Dorothy
Litwin Professor of American Studies at Cornell University.) 
 By GLENN C. ALTSCHULER   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The first week of her freshman year at Cornell University, Kate
Wilkinson of Plymouth, Mass., made a mistake. She agreed to play
Trivial Pursuit with several other students in her dormitory. Kate
was embarrassed that she did not know what element was converted to
plutonium in the first nuclear reactor, what onetime Yugoslav
republic is shaped like a boomerang or even the longest American
war. Far worse, everyone else did (or seemed to). Kate called her
mother and, between sobs, voiced her fear that she was not smart
enough to succeed at the university.
</P>
<P>
   While some first-year students experience little or no anxiety,
most have a stress story like Kate's, be it academic or personal _
about family or financial responsibilities, inadequate high school
preparation or pressure to do well in today's increasingly
competitive environment.
</P>
<P>
   In a 1999 survey of 683 colleges and universities conducted in
the first days of school by the University of California at Los
Angeles, 30.2 percent of freshmen acknowledged that they frequently
felt overwhelmed, almost double the rate in 1985. Appointments at
Cornell's counseling and psychological services have risen 29
percent in the last four years. More than 40 percent of first-year
students at Johns Hopkins University in Baltimore visit its
counseling center.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Samuel Parrish, medical director of the Student Health and
Wellness Center at Johns Hopkins, said better recordkeeping,
greater awareness of on-campus services and additional staff and
office hours account for some of the increase. And, Parrish said,
now ``there is no stigma in asking for help.''
</P>
<P>
   Mental health professionals say that young adults appear to be
under much more stress than in the past. Many of them have fewer
``stabilizing forces in their lives,'' said Dr. David Fassler,
chair of the American Psychiatric Association's Council on
Children, Adolescents and Their Families and author of ``Help Me,
I'm Sad'' (Viking, 1997). ``Many live far away from their extended
family, or they've moved a lot of times so they're less connected
to their neighborhoods.''
</P>
<P>
   At the extreme end, more students may be arriving on campus with
diagnosed psychological problems. After documenting a rising
incidence of depression among students, Harvard University issued a
report last year recommending, among other steps, that more
psychologists be hired, that residence assistants and tutors
receive instruction on mental problems and that two rooms be set
aside in every living unit for students experiencing emotional
crises.
</P>
<P>
   While academic pressure may not cause mental illness, it can act
as a trigger. ``Some kids have a genetic predisposition for
depression, and are more likely than others to get depressed,''
Fassler said, ticking off the warning signs _ ``sadness, decreased
energy and appetite, loss of interest in usual activities,
decreased interest in sex, any thoughts of suicide.''
</P>
<P>
   Most students, of course, are not clinically depressed but are
experiencing the self-doubt and anxiety typically associated with
the critical transition from high school and home to college, and
will adjust. Wilkinson, for example, has made that transition and
is now doing well.
</P>
<P>
   In an effort to minimize the trauma of freshman year, most
colleges and universities supply peer counselors, residence hall
advisers, faculty advisers, an academic advising center, a mental
health clinic and suicide prevention services. At Cornell, students
can call the Empathy, Assistance and Referral Service; at the State
University of New York at Albany, the Middle Earth Peer Assistance
Program sponsors a hotline, a campus radio talk show, a weekly
advice column and peer theater performances about student problems.
</P>
<P>
   Even those organized activities of freshman year _ ice cream
socials, Wilderness Reflection weekends, wrestling parties in
kiddie swimming pools filled with yogurt _ have therapeutic
undercurrents to help students let off steam and face the seemingly
monumental task ahead.
</P>
<P>
   Noting that students who accept stress as normal and even
beneficial tend to respond more creatively to its demands,
therapists, counselors and faculty offer a variety of advice for
coping with freshman year.
</P>
<P>
   In ``Beating the College Blues'' (Checkmark Books, 1999), Paul
A. Grayson and Philip Meilman advise students who are frequently
irritable, anxious or angry, or have difficulty sleeping, to try
relaxation techniques: slow, deep breathing, warm baths,
meditation, guitar playing, a long walk.
</P>
<P>
   Grayson and Meilman, who direct counseling services at New York
University and Cornell, also recommend making an inventory of
commitments (say, a five-course load, 20-hour-a-week job, crew team
practice at 6 a.m., a steady girlfriend); personal habits
(procrastinating or partying too much?) as well as impressions of
college life. That exercise helps students determine whether to
drop a course or change study habits. A reality check by peers and
parents can also identify flawed thinking (``I'm the only person
here who has not chosen a major'').
</P>
<P>
   Students tend to waste time between classes, then try to read
and to write papers at night, when they are tired and are tempted
to socialize. It is better to complete three to four hours of
course-related work, six days a week, before dinner. Students who
get eight hours of sleep, get up early and study during the day,
starting with the first week of classes, do not have to scramble as
the assignments pile up. (This schedule has another advantage: the
first person up in the morning gets immediate access to the
bathroom and a hot shower.)
</P>
<P>
   Freshmen should get to know at least one adult on campus fairly
well, starting with a faculty adviser. Alas, many students stand at
the adviser's door with a hand on the knob, seeking a signature and
speedy get-away, afraid to interrupt a Nobel Prize-winning
experiment. More often than not, those who plant themselves in a
chair ready to discuss their backgrounds, their academic and
professional aspirations and uncertainties and their personal
interests will get a warm response. Students who take the
initiative to meet with advisers and visit professors' offices _
not only after doing poorly on an exam but also to discuss a
required text or ask how a professor became interested in a subject
_ learn that many teach better in private than in a large lecture
hall. And the college, whatever its size, begins to seem less
impersonal.
</P>
<P>
   In the midst of the forced social interaction that characterizes
college life, it takes time and many false starts to make a real
friend. Roommates do not have to be best friends, but they can be a
freshman's first friend. Eating dinner with a roommate, even if she
is only ``just OK,'' and meeting others in the dormitory and in
class will help students get through those sometimes lonely first
weeks.
</P>
<P>
   Participating in an extracurricular activity during the first
semester provides contact with students who share interests. With
their regular practice schedules, the marching band or rugby team
may inspire discipline and efficiency.
</P>
<P>
   Noting that Henry David Thoreau went to the woods because he
wanted to live deliberately, Allan Emery, an English professor at
Bowling Green University in Bowling Green, Ohio, reminds his
freshmen students to pause at least once a day to examine their
lives. Too often, as students drive through day after busy day,
waiting to vegetate, lubricate or unleash a primal scream on the
weekend, college resembles anything but Walden Pond. ``Seize
opportunities to reflect on life _ your life and the lives of
others,'' Emery suggests, ``and you will be far less likely to lose
your equilibrium. That's what those well-stocked libraries,
tree-lined avenues and peacefulquadrangles are for.''

NO NEWS IS GOOD NEWS FOR THE GOP 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DAVID M. SHRIBMAN  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHILADELPHIA _ The news correspondents are growing restless;
they've found no news. The conservatives are growing rebellious;
nobody is talking their language. The religious activists are
growing suspicious; their issues are being ignored.
</P>
<P>
   But none of that may be important. Forgotten amid the grousing
in the grandstand is an emerging new truth of a new brand of
political gathering: For the first time in a generation, these
sessions of the Republican National Convention are not designed to
provide news to reporters, to provide succor to conservatives, or
to provide reassurance to activists.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, there is news here in Philadelphia. It is that the
Republicans may have found a revolutionary way to seed the
political landscape with a subtle, positive message that defies the
needs of the media, confounds the expectations of conservatives and
frustrates the reflexes of religious activists.
</P>
<P>
   The rhetoric may be mind-numbing in its repetitiveness, the
stage presentations may be contrived, the tone may be artificial.
No matter. The Republicans have their story and they're sticking
with it. And that story is simple: Moderation. Inclusion. A party
speaking in unison.
</P>
<P>
   And so as Governor George W. Bush of Texas prepares for a
high-stakes acceptance speech that his strategists hope will put a
fresh, inviting face on the Republican Party, he is doing so in a
convention hall, and in a nation, that for three days has been
primed to receive the new GOP message.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's got the Republicans united,'' said Governor Paul
Cellucci, a close Bush ally. ``He has to get a message to Democrats
and independents. He'll seize the opportunity.''
</P>
<P>
   Hour after hour, day after day, from the podium, on the floor
and on the airwaves, disciplined Republicans have been emphasizing
education; stressing Bush's personality; arguing that the governor,
as foreign-policy adviser Condoleezza Rice put it Tuesday night,
``keeps his word and tells the truth''; and speaking ominously of
the lack of integrity in the Oval Office.
</P>
<P>
   In this new calculus, it may not matter that the television
networks have sharply curtailed their convention broadcasts, nor
that few people are tuning into cable outlets or the abbreviated
network telecasts. The notion that nothing much is happening in
Philadelphia _ no credentials fights, no platform fights, no floor
fights _ is in the air.
</P>
<P>
   That's annoying to the people who like pugilism in their
politics, including news reporters, for whom contention is the
oxygen of their work.
</P>
<P>
   ``Republicans are taking the attitude that no news is good
news,'' says L. Brent Bozell III, president of the Conservative
Victory Committee. ``The problem is that in politics, no news is no
news.''
</P>
<P>
   But the Republican calculation here is that, in an era when the
public is impatient with politics, no news may be the right tonic,
and a politics devoid of conflict may be less off-putting than one
full of conflict.
</P>
<P>
   Bozell is not the only critic. ``It's great to talk about
leaving no children behind,'' said Keith Appell, a Republican
strategist. ``So far the convention is still missing that magic
element of `us' versus `them.' ''
</P>
<P>
   That element makes for great spectator sport (and, for people
like Appel, a happy warrior for conservative causes, great
participatory sport). But the Republicans aren't interested in
cultivating the notion of ``us'' versus ``them.'' The entire theme
of the Philadelphia festivities is ``us'' _ all of us.
</P>
<P>
   Preliminary indices suggest that the strategy may be working. A
bipartisan Battleground 2000 Poll shows a modest spurt this week to
enlarge Bush's lead plus an unusual rise in the percentage of
Americans who believe things in this country have gotten off on the
wrong track _ itself a measure of the success the Republicans may
be having here in Philadelphia.
</P>
<P>
   In this atmosphere, the Bush campaign has been given no
incentive to change its strategy. That's why Bush's acceptance
speech almost certainly will hammer at the same themes. ``The most
important message he has to send is one of inclusion _ that he
wants to be president of all the people,'' said Senator Susan
Collins, the Maine Republican.
</P>
<P>
   ``He has to connect and make everyone feel great and show his
personality,'' said Representative Jennifer Dunn of Washington, a
member of the House GOP leadership. ``That's the selling point.''
</P>
<P>
   A jazz concert is defined by the downbeat. This convention is
defined by the upbeat. It is discordant to the many of those here
in Philadelphia. It may be music to the GOP's ears.

   GOP-RDP-NYT (Philadelphia) _ A convention roundup: Gov. George
W. Bush makes his calibrated entry into Philadelphia, as delegates
at the 37th Republican National Convention select him as their
nominee for president. Bush and Dick Cheney are to receive their
party's official nominations, and Cheney will speak to the
convention. By Richard L. Berke.

   GOP-BUSH-NYT (Undated) _ Man in the News profile: Just six years
ago, when George W. Bush ran for governor of Texas, even his own
parents expected him to lose; it was his younger brother Jeb who
held the family's confidence. Friends and family members say that
the elder Bushes worried that George W. would be forced to bow
again, as he had several times before, to failure. But that story
had a surprise ending: While Jeb lost, George won. And in the
process, George Walker Bush launched himself, without any grand
plan or intricate forethought, on a trajectory that on Thursday
will place him in the spotlight as the Republican nominee for
president. By Nicholas D. Kristof and Frank Bruni.

   KAN-SCHOOLS (Topeka, Kan.) _ Sending a strong signal in the

primary voters chose three candidates for the Kansas Board of
Education who promised to back science standards with a greater
emphasis on evolution. Two incumbents and another candidate who
support the state's current standards that play down the importance
of evolution were defeated in Republican primaries Tuesday.

   PALESTINIAN-CAMP (Nablus, West Bank) _ It is summer camp time
for 25,000 Palestinian teen-agers, and unusual camps they are. As
devised by the men who handle psychological warfare for Yasser
Arafat, the Palestinian leader, there is no horsing around in the
dorm, no fun-in-the-sun by a cool clear cool lake. Instead, there
is the chance to stage a mock kidnapping of an Israeli leader,
ending with the Israeli's bodyguards sprawled dead. In the summer
of the latest Camp David talks, the summer that was supposed to
produce a final peace settlement between Israel and its Palestinian
adversaries, the Palestinians' idea of how teen-age boys can best
use the summer days is a reminder of how deep old enmities run. By

   INDIA-KIDNAP (Bangalore, India) _ The legendary outlaw Veerappan
has ranged through the jungles of South India for a generation,
slaughtering elephants, smuggling sandalwood and playing Robin Hood
to the people of the forest. For the past decade, hundreds of
policemen have been dedicated to nothing but hunting him down. He
has been charged with murdering dozens of them. This week he put
into action his boldest, most diabolical plan yet to win a pardon
for his crimes. On Sunday, he abducted Rajkumar, a movie star whose
half century-long career portraying Hindu gods, ancient kings and
heroes of every kind has endowed the actor himself with mythical
stature. The kidnapping has provoked mobs of fans to stone passing
cars, blockade major roads with flaming tires, pressure shopkeepers
to pull down their metal shutters _ and brought life in a bustling,
modern metropolis to a shuddering, grinding halt. By Celia W.
Dugger.

 &HT;    Dell Computer stock continues slide
 &HT;    By John Pletz
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ Dell Computer Corp. stock continued to tumble
Wednesday when one industry analyst downgraded the stock and fueled
continued speculation about whether the computer maker's growth is
slowing more than previously thought.
</P>
<P>
   After falling 5.4 percent Tuesday to $41.56 per share, Dell's
stock slipped another $2, or 4.8 percent, Wednesday to close at
$39.56. Since July 17, the stock has fallen $14, or 26 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Ashok Kumar, an analyst for U.S. Bancorp Piper Jaffray,
downgraded Dell to ``buy'' from ``strong buy.'' He questioned not
only the company's short-term prospects, but also suggested that
Dell's glory days of runaway growth and soaring stock price may be
behind it.
</P>
<P>
   Kumar, who has been sharply critical of DelgeNet, questioned
whether the PC maker can hit its own revenue-growth targets.
</P>
<P>
   Dell spent the past year persuading Wall Street to lower
expectations for earnings and revenue growth to about 30 percent
annually from the 50 percent rate the company had enjoyed.
</P>
<P>
   Kumar wrote that while Dell might be able to meet the earnings
target, ``we are skeptical that the company will be able to meet
the 30 percent revenue-growth expectations on a sustainable
basis.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We continue to believe that Dell does not have adequate
earnings power in notebooks, server and nonsystem revenue to offset
the secular weakness in consumer and commercial desktops.''
</P>
<P>
   Dell, which is scheduled to report second-quarter results next
Thursday, did not comment. It is subject to ``quiet period''
restrictions that prohibit discussing company performance in
advance of quarterly earnings announcements.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts expect Dell to earn 21 cents per share, according to a
survey by First Call/Thomson Financial.
</P>
<P>
   In general, analysts remain bullish on Dell: 19 rate it a
``strong buy,'' while five call it a ``moderate buy,'' and four tag
it a ``hold,'' according to Zacks Investment Research Inc.
</P>
<P>
   Some analysts have been skittish about PC makers in general in
recent weeks since two market-research firms reported that the
industry's second-quarter sales were weaker than expected.
</P>
<P>
   IDC and Gartner Group's Dataquest both said overall
second-quarter shipments grew more slowly this year than in 1999,
though last year's results were unusually high because of buying in
advance of Y2K.
</P>
<P>
   Both firms also suggested that the U.S. and European markets,
which grew more slowly than the rest of the world, are beginning to
mature. That's of particular concern with Dell, which does 70
percent of its business in the United States and 21 percent in
Europe.
</P>
<P>
   IDC estimated last week that Dell actually lost a very small
percentage of market share in the Europe/Middle East/Africa segment
during the second quarter, slipping to 9.1 percent from 9.3 percent
a year ago. Its shipments increased 6.4 percent from a year ago,
slightly below the overall market rate of 9.6 percent.
</P>
<P>
   TheStreet.com reported Tuesday that another analyst, Andrew Neff
of Bear Stearns, also raised some concerns about Dell's short-term
revenue prospects in a note to the firm's staff. Neff did not put
out a note to clients.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's probably some concern over the IDC numbers, and the
slower rollout of Windows 2000. That's more of a fourth-quarter
story,'' David Bailey, an analyst who follows Dell for Gerard
Klauer Mattison, said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   More important to investors, Kumar questioned whether Dell's
stock _ which split six times between October 1995 and March 1999 _
will break out of the $35-$60 funk it's been in for the past 18
months.
</P>
<P>
   ``The stock does not possess anywhere near the momentum it did
in 1997/1998,'' he wrote. ``The stock has now dropped below its
two-year, moving-average line, at $42, which is beginning to
flatten out. Bottom line _ real technical deterioration has set
in.''

RESERVED TEXANS `ON MESSAGE' _ SO FAR 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By SAM ALLIS  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHILADELPHIA - What's up with the Texans? They're behaving like
Lutherans.
</P>
<P>
   The 124-member delegation here for the coronation of their
dauphin are positively demure by Lone Star standards. It's eerie.
</P>
<P>
   They are light on the swagger, the chauvinism, the plumb
weirdness that have made them seem a separate species of American
ever since the thing at the Alamo didn't work out.
</P>
<P>
   When asked about George W. Bush this week, they address like
cyborgs his integrity, his vision, his outstanding track record as
governor. They always refer to him in the third person as
``governor.'' They never deviate from the program.
</P>
<P>
   Nothing wrong with it, mind you, but that's the argot of
consultants, not real people. Texans normally start on message and
then wander off the reservation to opine about Nolan Ryan or ask
you where you bought that belt. So what gives?
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't want to screw this up,'' explained Skipper Wallace, a
fifth generation Texan from Lampasas with interests in cattle,
sugar, restaurants, you name it. ``We want to win. It's that
simple. So everyone is on message. We really want to do Texas
proud.''
</P>
<P>
   Jim Ciccone, a delegation whip (and AT&AMP;T general counsel),
added, ``Everybody's hungry. They want to win. They're putting
aside policy issues for the sake of the party.''
</P>
<P>
   While Texas has fielded potent congressional leaders for
decades, it hasn't had a president since LBJ. It's time. LBJ, by
the way, is a loaded proposition to this crowd because he was a
Democrat. ``Don't you put us in the same category with him,''
snapped Betty Lou Martin, a Houston delegate.
</P>
<P>
   While this rare Texas reserve may be smart politics, it's no
fun. This convention is in desperate need of some pizazz, and
Texans can normally be counted on to salvage a dud of a party. But
all is not lost. Robert Pate, a Corpus Christi lawyer, promised a
good show when Bush accepts his party's nomination: ``You'll see it
Thursday night. We'll be in uniform then.''
</P>
<P>
   And that's some uniform: a shirt version of the Texas flag,
complete with a prominent lone star on a background of red, white
and blue. The garment is as subdued as five-alarm chili.
</P>
<P>
   Add to that a straw cowboy hat and a prized ``Bush For
President'' pin modeled after the Texas ranger shield, and you've
got a Texas delegate primed for action.
</P>
<P>
   Pate is already cleaned out of the pins. He has given half a
dozen away since Monday because they are (itals)the(unitals) pins
to sport in Philadelphia this week. ``Somebody came up to me and
said, `You're a Ranger, right?' '' he said with a grin.
</P>
<P>
   This is indeed the Lone Star apotheosis. ``It can't get any
better than this,'' said Carole Ragland of League City. The Texas
contingent occupies the high ground in the hall, directly below the
podium. The media hangs on their every word rather than ridiculing
their new money. They get treated particularly well around town.
</P>
<P>
   The reserve can't last. Texans are bred to run high, wide and
handsome. ``We do brag too much. We need to learn humility,'' said
Wallace, who believes not a word of what he just said. ``But it's
based on performance. We're proud of what we've done.''
</P>
<P>
   Unlike his father, George W. Bush radiates this ethos. That's
why they like him down there. ``One of his father's biggest
problems was that he wasn't bold enough,'' added Wallace. ``The
governor is not that way.''
</P>
<P>
   Beneath the long, tall rhetoric is another truth that applies to
Bush the younger: Texans look pathologically to the future.
Congressman Joe Barton recalls that a Yankee journalist once asked
a group of Texans what the best days in their business careers
were. One man replied, ``My best day is next Tuesday,'' the date he
expected an oil deal to close. That, says Barton, tells you all you
need to know about the state and its candidate.
</P>
<P>
   Texans continue to embrace their mythology as much as their
future. In doing so, they perpetuate the stereotypes they profess
to abhor. Never mind. Theirs is sacred soil. Could there be another
delegation here that recites both the Pledge of Allegiance
(itals)and(unitals) the state Pledge of Allegiance, as the Texans
did at breakfast Tueday?
</P>
<P>
   And why not? ``This is our 30 minutes of fame,'' said Skipper
Wallace, who in typical Texas fashion doubles the usual 15 minutes
alloted to everyone else.

   PHILADELPHIA _ Tidbits from the Republican National Convention:
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Bob Barr is bringing in a rock star to help him with his
campaign down in Georgia. In the midst of a re-election bid, Barr
said rocker Ted Nugent _ a hunting enthusiast _ would give an
archery demonstration at Jim Miller Park in Marietta on Aug. 20.
</P>
<P>
   ``He probably won't sing _ it's a Sunday,'' the congressman said
here Wednesday. Barr said he admired Nugent's ``raw, unbridled
passion.''
</P>
<P>
   ``They say he gets out there on that stage, and he blasts the
Clinton administration. He's not afraid of it. He doesn't shy away
from it,'' Barr said.
</P>
<P>
   George P. is hot, hot, hot.
</P>
<P>
   But schoolmates from Gulliver Prep in Pinecrest Village near
Miami said George Prescott Bush, the candidate's nephew and the No.
4 bachelor in People's list of the 100 Most Eligible, wasn't
regarded as the No. 1 hunk on campus.
</P>
<P>
   ``But you should know that Enrique Iglesias also went to our
school,'' said Tzaicel Hernandez, 22, one of several GOP Youth
Convention delegates from Miami who attended the private academy
with George P. and his sister, Noele, the children of Florida Gov.
Jeb Bush and his Mexican-born wife, Columba.
</P>
<P>
   George P. ``is really a nice guy. Down to earth. Really smart,''
said Olga Arguello, 22. ``When I see him, I don't think, 'Oh, now
you're a celebrity.' He's just a regular guy.''
</P>
<P>
   ``He's got a good head on his shoulders. I say that first
because all anybody ever asks about are his movie-star looks,''
said Alany Cruz, 22.
</P>
<P>
   So is he as good-looking as a movie star?
</P>
<P>
   ``Oh yes,'' said Cruz. ``He will one day be president.''
</P>
<P>
   Ann Stone, leader of Republicans For Choice, is hoping to start
working next year with a new first lady.
</P>
<P>
   ``Laura Bush is someone we can work with'', Stone said at a
briefing for foreign media Wednesday. ``Laura talks about common
ground in the discussion on abortion.''
</P>
<P>
   Republicans for Choice favors voluntary action to reduce
abortion by reducing unintended pregnancies. ``This issue should go
away, and non-legislative programs are the best way to achieve
it'', Stone said.
</P>
<P>
   She said she does not expect George W. Bush to mention the issue
during Thursday night's acceptance speech. The party's platform is
strongly anti-abortion, although Stone claimed that half the GOP's
voters and two-thirds of its donors are pro-choice.
</P>
<P>
   Costumes are the big thing among protestors these days, to the
point that it's tough to separate the angry from the just plain
weird. During the height of a confrontation on downtown streets
this week, police radios crackled with a report of two dozen men
and women _ all wearing red dresses and make-up _ sprinting
pell-mell through the streets.
</P>
<P>
   What was their beef? They didn't have one. Turns out the fashion
plates were members of a local running club. The dressed-up dash is
simply something they do once a year.
</P>
<P>
   For his MSNBC client, pollster Frank Luntz has assembled a focus
group of swing voters who wouldn't be caught dead watching the GOP
convention unless they were paid. The big convention story so far,
as Luntz sees it: ``Colin Powell hit a home run with his 1966
speech to the Republicans in San Diego. But this time he hit a
grand slam.''
</P>
<P>
   The strong positive reaction was due as much to his style as
what he had to say, Luntz reported. The former general's focus on
education scored well among the undecideds, while his praise of
affirmative action played better among those who lean to the
Democrats.
</P>
<P>
   If you don't know the pledge of allegiance to the Texas flag,
ask a Republican convention delegate. The Texas Delegation each
morning at its breakfast here pledges allegiance not just to the
United States of America, but to Texas.
</P>
<P>
   Speaking to a National Federation of Independent Business
gathering, Rep. J.C. Watts, an African-American Republican who grew
up in Eufala, Okla., said raising the minimum wage might make it
tough for his brother's barbecue business back home.
</P>
<P>
   It's not right, Watts said, for the government to tell his
brother how much to pay his four employees.
</P>
<P>
   ``Friends, in my opinion, that is communism,'' Watts said.

ALLIED DOME HAS A NEW PLAN FOR DUNKIN' DONUTS 
</HEADLINE>

<P>
   It may be a nutritionist's nightmare _ or a trencherman's
delight _ but put doughnuts and $5 sandwiches under one restaurant
roof, and maybe add ice cream, and one restaurant company thinks it
has a winning formula for rapid growth and a menu that will appeal
to consumers all day long.
</P>
<P>
   Most Americans are familiar with Dunkin' Donuts. In 1997
Dunkin's British parent, Allied Dome &UR;  &LR; Plc, acquired the Togo's
sandwich chain, and for the last few years, Allied Dome's Randolph,
Mass.-based quick-service restaurant division has been testing
``combo'' formats where Dunkin' Donuts and Togo's share a location
and, often, a parking lot and a drive-through window as well.
</P>
<P>
   After much experimentation, Allied Dome &UR;  &LR; thinks it has the right
formula, and if it can line up enough real estate, it hopes to
rapidly expand from about 25 of these combo restaurants to as many
as 400 nationwide by the end of 2002.
</P>
<P>
   Allied Dome &UR;  &LR; also owns Baskin Robbins, the ice cream chain.
Where enough space is available, some new restaurants could be
``trombos.'' At triple combination sites that sell sinkers, subs,
and sundaes, the hope is that there will be a variety of foods that
appeal to consumers morning, noon, and night.
</P>
<P>
   Sometimes called ``multi-branding,'' the combining of two or
more restaurants such as a Dunkin' Donuts and a Togo's into a sort
of mini food court has been around for years but is now gaining
popularity.
</P>
<P>
   The company that owns Pizza Hut, Taco Bell, and KFC has toyed
with the idea. And Papa Gino's Holdings Corp. of Dedham, Mass.,
which in 1997 bought D'Angelo sandwich shops, opened its first
``dual unit'' last year in Norwood, Mass. Over the next few months,
plans call for the opening of seven or eight more locations that
combine a Papa Gino's and a D'Angelo.
</P>
<P>
   Multi-branding can be ``a winning strategy'' for quick-service
chains, said executive vice president Dennis Lombardi of Technomic
Inc., a firm that tracks the fast-food industry.
</P>
<P>
   For consumers, grouping restaurants together offers more choices
and one-stop convenience. For chains, operating three different
food concepts at one location can mean a lot less overhead expense
than operating three separate restaurants.
</P>
<P>
   Multi-branding may be ``the future for individual niche
concepts,'' said Groton restaurant consultant Joyce Faiola.
</P>
<P>
   In any case, Allied Dome's quick-service restaurant division now
seems poised for an aggressive rollout of its combos and trombos.
</P>
<P>
   On the East Coast, plans call for the Dunkin' Donuts brand to
introduce and promote Togo's to its customers in New England, the
mid-Atlantic region, and some Southern states.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Togo's, which got its start in San Jose, Calif., is
expected to play a big role in bulking up Dunkin' Donuts' small
presence on the West Coast.
</P>
<P>
   Dunkin' Donuts eyes a California invasion next year as it looks
to going from a handful of West Coast units to at least one hundred
Dunkin' Donuts-Togo's combos in a brief time.
</P>
<P>
   ``Once we go, we'll go fast,'' said Mark Richardson, vice
president for multi-branding at Allied Dome's quick-service
division.
</P>
<P>
   Looking to raise its awareness in New England, Togo's is airing
its first radio and TV ad campaign in Greater Boston.
</P>
<P>
   With loving closeups of pastrami and barbecued chicken, ads
extol the virtues of the Togo's sandwich. The tagline for the ads:
``Let us make you one.'' Ads were tied to a promotion in which
Dunkin' Donuts customers received coupons for Togo's sandwiches.
</P>
<P>
   ``We want to expose the Dunkin' Donuts customer to Togo's,''
Richardson said. ``Once we have awareness, Togo's does well.''
</P>
<P>
   Allied Dome &UR;  &LR; doesn't expect to sell doughnuts, chicken
sandwiches, and ice cream to a single consumer all at the same
time. Rather, it aims to offer consumers different products at
different times of day.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, Dunkin' Donuts' 4,100 restaurants reported sales of
$2.14 billion, and consultant Lombardi reckoned a big chunk of
those sales came before noon.
</P>
<P>
   Togo's gets the chain into the lunch business, something Dunkin'
Donuts couldn't do on its own. And Baskin Robbins is generally at
its busiest between 4 p.m. and 8 p.m.
</P>
<P>
   By combining the three concepts, ``you can appeal to people
throughout a 12-hour period,'' consultant Faiola noted.
</P>
<P>
   With about 300 restaurants and 1999 sales of $167 million,
Togo's is competing in a tough $6.4 billion market for
quick-service sandwiches, in which one of the biggest players is
Subway, a chain with nearly 14,500 units. Privately held Subway of
Milford, Conn., does not report sales.
</P>
<P>
   With ``made-for-you'' sandwiches in the $5 range, Togo's aims to
keep it simple. It doesn't do french fries. It doesn't do pockets
or wraps, said Richardson, who claims that Togo's fare is more
upscale and of a higher quality than Subway's.
</P>
<P>
   Subway spokesman Les Winograd strongly disagreed with that
characterization. Subway, he said, offers a far wider variety of
sandwiches, including gourmet subs, at a range of prices.
</P>
<P>
   At roughly 205 D'Angelo locations, many entrees fall into the $5
range. D'Angelo also offers a line of grilled sandwiches, and its
bread is made daily at a company-owned bakery.
</P>
<P>
   Togo's features ``a lot of sprouts and avocado and West
Coast-type vegetables,'' said Bill Chiccarelli, Papa Gino's
director of marketing. ``D'Angelo is more into mainstream
mom-and-pop vegetables like pickles, onions, and tomatoes.''
</P>
<P>
   After upgrading D'Angelo's systems, Papa Gino's looks to grow
more rapidly. One potential growth vehicle is the ``dual unit''
restaurant, with D'Angelo aiming at a lunch customer and Papa
Gino's going after the dinner trade. The company also has high
hopes for a new D'Angelo format configured for mall food courts.
</P>
<P>
   As chains try to expand, they all face the same problem.
</P>
<P>
   ``The real estate market is fairly tough right now,''
Chiccarelli said.
</P>
<P>
   A Dunkin' Donuts veteran, Chiccarelli recalled that when
Starbucks Corp. arrived in the Boston area, dire predictions were
made about Starbucks taking business from Dunkin' Donuts.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, both chains thrived, in part because consumers began
drinking more coffee. Chiccarelli thinks something similar could
happen with sandwiches.
</P>
<P>
   Is it possible in this era of concern about health, vanity, and
cholesterol that consumers can increase their food intake? Don't
bet against it. In 1999 spending on quick-service pizza and
doughnuts rose nearly 9 percent, according to Technomic.
</P>
<P>
   When it comes to health food and diets, said consultant Faiola,
``People talk the talk, but they don't walk the walk.''

A LIFE REWIRED FOR SOUND 
</HEADLINE>
   By WILLIAM L. HAMILTON   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK_ Sitting in the 5.1 surround sound studio installed in
his newly renovated apartment on Hudson Street, Carter Burwell, a
film composer, was talking about romantic comedy.
</P>
<P>
   ``I find it the most difficult thing,'' Burwell, 44, said.
``People on screen are happy _ the music is happy. People are sad _
the music is sad. I prefer a more ironic approach. If people are
being killed on screen, then I can be carefree,'' he said,
musically speaking.
</P>
<P>
   Burwell's latest deadline is ``Blair Witch 2,'' to be released
on Halloween. His first film assignment was ``Blood Simple'' in
1984, re-released last month. Nearly 50 films, from action to
independents, ``Three Kings'' to ``Being John Malkovich,'' have
intervened.
</P>
<P>
   The scrupulously spare 3,000-square-foot loft, which Burwell
shares with his wife, Christine Sciulli, a lighting designer and
video artist, is now also a contradiction in creative terms: It
conceals more than 5 miles of analog and digital audio, video and
Ethernet cable and 11 electronic patch boxes, which allow Burwell
to compose in the peace of his own apartment _ anywhere from his
studio to the bathtub.
</P>
<P>
   ``I tried separating my life from my work,'' said Burwell, whose
previous studio was on 37th Street. ``I was a total failure at
it.''
</P>
<P>
   The new $1.5 million space in the Powell Building is predicated
on the reflective pleasures of silence and wired for the chaotic
business of sound. It was designed by Desai/Chia Studio, the
architects, in cooperation with John Storyk, an acoustical
consultant, whose first project was Jimi Hendrix's Electric
Ladyland Studios, and Ted Rothstein, an audiovisual and cabling
specialist.
</P>
<P>
   ``He really appreciates silence,'' Chia said of Burwell. ``It
was important that he feel that sense of silence and calm.''
</P>
<P>
   Rothstein, whose clients include Cindy Crawford and Matt Dillon,
said of the job, ``There's more technology per square inch than
I've ever put in a space that size before.''
</P>
<P>
   In style, what the composer wanted was a kind of visual quiet,
with the resonance of nature in the design's details _ a pond, a
fireplace, beautiful woods and interesting stone _ as though he
were on a walk through an idealized landscape, like the mountain
paths in a Chinese painting.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wanted a minimal, if not minimalist, aesthetic,'' Burwell
said. ``I wanted it to be very simple.''
</P>
<P>
   He lived in the loft for six years without renovations. ``It had
been converted by an architect,'' he recalled. ``As you walked
through it, you sort of saw his development as an architect: the
thesis project, postmodern, neo-Classical. Every room was
different.''
</P>
<P>
   Many of the 25 windows, with four exposures _ the great
brilliance of the space _ had been covered over by walls. ``I lived
here, clawing away at the wallboard over the windows, Burwell said.
</P>
<P>
   He was introduced to Chia and her partner, Arjun Desai, in 1997,
by Sciulli, who had worked with them and was then a friend of
Burwell.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's funny to hear you talk about how you've measured the
design process, when I'm seeing our relationship,'' Sciulli said
last week to the architects. Construction was completed two months
ago. Burwell and Sciulli were married during the renovation _ a
romantic reverse on the comedy of most renovation tales.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was living in Hell's Kitchen, and I was living in the East
Village, and neither place was big enough to cohabitate in,'' she
said. ``So this was like moving into a house, after we got
married.''
</P>
<P>
   Burwell presented his new architects with pictures, like an
un-scored film, as a template for what he hoped to have.
</P>
<P>
   ``He had a whole portfolio of images,'' Chia said. ``Natural
elements that inspired him _ crystals, the veining of a leaf _ not
straightforward design.''
</P>
<P>
   In turn, the architects immersed themselves in Burwell's music,
in which they discovered surprising parallels. ``He understands the
absence of things, as a feature, the way a designer would,'' Chia
said. ``A lot we were able to answer, instead of asking him
questions, by just listening to his music.''
</P>
<P>
   Burwell's experiments with unusual instruments, for instance,
encouraged the architects to use materials in unconventional
juxtapositions, like unfinished concrete and finely polished
traditional Italian stucco work, in the bathroom.
</P>
<P>
   ``They invited me to be as abstract in our first discussions as
possible,'' Burwell said. ``I tried not to be too specific. I
wanted fire. I wanted water.''
</P>
<P>
   Together, they established their themes, taking cues from both
Western and Eastern architecture _ from wide-plank New England
maple floors to Japanese bathhouses.
</P>
<P>
   At the entrance are the loft's open living and dining spaces. A
low, raw-concrete watercourse with a small fountain, which focuses
the eye and ear, creates the still seclusion of an Islamic
courtyard.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have a lot of construction going on in TriBeCa,'' Burwell
said. ``Just the tinkling of some water brings your attention
inside, from the din outside.'' A wall of sapele, a type of
Nigerian mahogany, hangs above the watercourse.
</P>
<P>
   Burwell took special care in selecting materials. ``The detail
of the design is in the grain of the wood, or in the raw surface of
the concrete, rather than moldings,'' he said. ``It's the type of
detail that you have to get close to and look at. That's the scale
of detail I like.''
</P>
<P>
   Sciulli asked the architects to run the grain horizontally. It
catches the light in a long, rhythmic wave.
</P>
<P>
   Behind the wall is a bathroom in the style of a Japanese
bathhouse: a large rectangular, concrete soaking tub sits beneath
two acid-etched glass windows, which can be swung open for a view
across the bedroom corridor to the open skyline of New York. At
night, the bathroom wall lights the hall.
</P>
<P>
   Burwell has recorded there, too, seated in the tub with a
microphone: water music for ``Blair Witch 2.'' The sounds will be
transformed electronically into instruments.
</P>
<P>
   At the end of the corridor is the master bedroom and library,
which Chia created as a Chinese scholar's retreat. The fireplace's
tall bluestone chimney, separating sleeping from study, might be an
outdoor element. The architects themselves stacked flat stones for
the mason, because they vary subtly in thickness and color. Sciulli
designed a thin, knife-edge cut in the ceiling at the top of the
chimney, tucking the lighting invisibly inside to create an
abstraction of sky above.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's James Turrell's edge,'' she said, speaking of the light
artist and his signature sky-room works. ``The knife edge makes the
ceiling look paper thin, so you perceive only a plane of light
floating down. The chimney looks like it's disappearing into a
cloud.''
</P>
<P>
   The sapele woodwork in the bedroom also incorporates much of the
furniture: a bed, bookshelves and reading and writing tools like a
counter that unfolds into a desk and a V-shape windowsill to cradle
reference books.
</P>
<P>
   As Sciulli and the architects reviewed the handsome work,
improvised music materialized, starting in the courtyard and
finding its way around the bathhouse and down the hall to the
bedroom, like children chasing each other: brightly colored notes
of regret, intrigue, deceit, relief and the expiring reprise of
fate, like scenes from the movies.
</P>
<P>
   Burwell sat playing his piano _ a scarred and blistered
Steinway, which he rescued after a fire and which he had repegged
and restrung, but refused to have reveneered. It looks like the
ghost of music. ``He does that,'' Sciulli said, listening. ``Just
play. We got into a horrible fight once. We broke up. And he sent
me a tape _ no words. He just sent me music. It was the most sad
music.''
</P>
<P>
   She laughed. ``It was a dirty trick,'' she said. ``He writes
film scores. He knows how to tweak those heartstrings.''

TELEFONICA SAYS LYCOS DEAL WILL BE SET BY NEXT MONTH 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By ROSS KERBER  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Spain's Telefonica SA said Wednesday it expects to complete by
mid-September a $2 billion rights offering to help in its pending
purchase of Internet portal Lycos Inc. of Waltham, Mass.
</P>
<P>
   Under the offering, current shareholders in Telefonica's Terra
Networks unit may purchase additional shares in the company for
about $56 apiece.
</P>
<P>
   Spanish regulators, meanwhile, have reportedly dropped their
insider-trading probe of Telefonica's former chairman, Juan
Villalonga, following his resignation last week.
</P>
<P>
   Villalonga had expanded the Madrid-based telecommunications
company but attracted much criticism for his high pay and
aggressive management style. Last week, he was replaced as
Telefonica's top officer by another board member, Cesar Alierta,
who said he would continue with the company's $12.5 billion Lycos
acquisition.
</P>
<P>
   Plans still call for Lycos to be combined with Terra Networks to
form a global Internet and content provider. In a statement this
week, Telefonica also reiterated its guarantee to purchase any new
shares of Terra Networks not purchased by Terra Networks' current
holders.
</P>
<P>
   The closing of the Lycos purcahse ``could take place during the
month of October,'' Telefonica said. Terra shareholders have
approved the transaction, which still requires approval from
regulators and Lycos shareholders.
</P>
<P>
   Separately, Spain's securities regulator dropped an insider
trading case against Villalonga, Bloomberg News reported. The
National Securities Market Commission said there wasn't enough
evidence to conclude that he had broken securities law.
</P>
<P>
   Villalonga had denied wrongdoing, though he admitted buying
options on 264,244 Telefonica shares in January 1998, two months
before his company announced a partnership with WorldCom Inc. to do
business in Latin America and the U.S.
</P>
<P>
   The regulator's report found ``the known facts and circumstances
in the current investigation don't amount to sufficient evidence to
proceed to a penalty phase for wrongfully using privileged
information.''
</P>
<P>
   The decision was expected by many analysts and investors, who
said the charge would be hard to prove against any investor, let
alone a man considered the country's most powerful executive. Only
one case of insider trading in Spain has been successfully
prosecuted in the past five years.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was too difficult to prove Villalonga used privileged
information,'' Roberto Mingot, an attorney at law firm of Squire,
Sanders &AMP; Dempsey in Madrid, said before the decision was made
public. ``Considering they consulted (telephone company) MCI and
U.S. regulators, and still couldn't nail him, there must not have
been enough evidence'' under Spanish law, he said.

<P>
   There's no positive proof it was John Wetteland, acting alone,
who stole our Texas summer. But that was him driving the getaway
car, right? Locally, the beautiful baseball months of August and
September have turned up missing. Gone forever. Vanished in the
night, like another Wetteland fastball with the game on the line.
</P>
<P>
   But with the crime, comes the whine, although certainly not from
Wetteland. The Rangers are cement-loafers, and I've got a multitude
of witnesses who will join me in testifying that the $6 million
closer is the guy who booked this club into Hotel Grouper.
</P>
<P>
   ``No, he didn't,'' answered manager Johnny Oates, perturbed.
``That's not fair to John Wetteland.''
</P>
<P>
   But if you want unfair, Mr. Oates, take a swig of this
injustice:
</P>
<P>
   The demise of the Rangers has now turned August over to the
Cowboys' exhibition season. There is no known boredom like NFL
preseason boredom. You say, Mr. Oates, that Wetteland doesn't
deserve to be horsewhipped, or at least indicted. I say, Mr. Oates,
that I don't deserve to watch Flozell Adams sweat in Wichita Falls.
But there is now no choice.
</P>
<P>
   For what it's worth, Wetteland never hides in bad times. He's a
standup guy, one who certainly hasn't waffled in this area even as
his days as a premier closer appear to be over. Wetteland, however,
doesn't need to defend himself. So many others have. At the moment,
Wetteland is the Dick Cheney of baseball when it comes to instant
defenders. And that includes local media gushing, particularly when
general manager Doug Melvin debated dealing the closer before
Monday's trading deadline. Never around here has there been such
supportive whining over a pitcher gone bad.
</P>
<P>
   Melvin held on to Wetteland only because he was offered no more
than a sack of fungoes in return. Which just proves that other
teams have scouts watching this stuff and Wetteland's ``stuff.''
He's still here because no one else wanted him _ not at the moment,
anyway.
</P>
<P>
   Getting back to the Oates' ``fairness'' issue when it comes to
blame for the bummer summer of 2000, Wetteland ranks high on the
guilty list, but no more so than Tim Crabtree, Rusty Greer, Darren
Oliver and about 10 others, including even Rafael Palmeiro, who
doesn't have the usual stellar numbers. Because of his job
description, Wetteland is the last link when he blows a game. This
year, he has blown too many. Book him, Dano. Plus, there's Melvin
in the front office. Blame is also splattered all over Doug.
</P>
<P>
   But now comes the hardest part. A one-season burial is
forgivable, but how do the Rangers recover in time for 2001? In the
AL West alone, Seattle and Oakland are better clubs this season
and, on paper, will be much better next season. So also might be
Anaheim. A year ago, the Rangers appeared to own the division. Now
they have to rent space in the cellar, and that's not necessarily
going to change in the near future.
</P>
<P>
   Wetteland had been the No. 1 difference between the Rangers and
the rest of the division. He was the proven closer no one else had.
But a high Melvin-Oates priority for 2001 has suddenly become
finding a closer. This is not easy. This is also not Wetteland. No
way he comes back. Not based on what is now being seen in the late
innings.
</P>
<P>
   Then there's the rotation, which has become the strength of both
Seattle and Oakland.
</P>
<P>
   ``As of this week, we've finally got our five best pitchers in
the rotation,'' Oates said. Yes, it's true. The trio of youngsters
_ Ryan Glynn, Matt Perisho and Doug Davis _ has joined Rick Helling
and Kenny Rogers. ``We'd have been better off going with those
three kids,'' added Oates, meaning as opposed to Mark Clark, Darren
Oliver and Esteban Loaiza.
</P>
<P>
   If nothing else, August and September will provide great
seasoning for the young pitchers, and also give clues about them
being rotation-ready for 2001. There is no doubt, however, Melvin
will attempt to add a veteran starter in the off-season, although
he's going to be gun-shy after the disasters of Clark and Oliver.
</P>
<P>
   The third major question of the off-season is what happens in
the outfield, which has become shy in run production. Is Gabe
Kapler's sudden resurgence for real? Much faith is placed in
hitting instructor Rudy Jaramillo, who had patience with Kapler
when the rest of us were screaming, ``hopeless.'' Jaramillo is a
big reason the Rangers wanted Ricky Ledee in that trade. Can Rudy
``fix'' Ricky after the Yankees couldn't?
</P>
<P>
   For all his potential, Ruben Mateo continues to be hounded by
health issues, now more than ever. And with Rusty Greer, there has
to be the assumption that he bounces back. He's simply better than
this.
</P>
<P>
   Only a few weeks ago, the Rangers appeared to be confused over
direction. There was indecision about playing for this season or
preparing for 2001. The Pudge Rodriguez injury answered much of
that, then Wetteland's repeated failures left no doubt.
</P>
<P>
   Summer ended early around here. It's a crime, don't you think?

`RING': JUERGEN FLIMM'S VERSION TELLS STORY ADMIRABLY 
</HEADLINE>
   By BERNARD HOLLAND   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   BAYREUTH, Germany _ To a Bayreuth Festival torn between
tradition and the call of modern times comes Juergen Flimm's new
production of the ``Ring des Nibelungen.''
</P>
<P>
   Flimm, known to Germans as a theater, not an opera, director,
brings to Wagner's week-long tetralogy a kind of low-key
iconoclasm. If the temple is not torn down, it is at least
redecorated.
</P>
<P>
   A new ``Ring'' arrives every four years or so at the summer
shrine built by the great man and dedicated to himself. The first
cycle began last week and continued into this one, ending last
night with ``Goetterdaemmerung.'' In place was the true Wagner
audience: reverently quiet, fiercely opinionated and at some
distance from the relatively clamorous crowd at the opening night's
``Parsifal.''
</P>
<P>
   Flimm and his set designer, Erich Wonder, give us a contemporary
landscape and fiddle extensively with the minutiae of Wagner's
stage directions. Valhalla is a high rise in the making, a
construction site framed by concrete slabs. Wotan and Alberich are
businessmen competing for hegemony. The descent into the caves of
Nibelheim ends in a contamination-free microchip factory.
</P>
<P>
   Loge, brightly done by Kim Begley, is a lawyer type with a
briefcase and a creamy three-piece suit. The Valkyries appear as a
squadron of airborne commandos in combat fatigues. The hall of the
Gibichungs is modular glass and stainless steel.
</P>
<P>
   Critics here have sniped at Flimm's alleged lifting of details
from previous radically updated performances of ``Ring,'' but they
may be missing the point.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, neither the pros and cons of 21st-century capitalism nor
the Freudianisms of dysfunctional family life seem to be much on
the director's mind. Past competitors have used the mythic
barbarism of the ``Ring'' to project a worldview of current events.
Flimm, on the other hand, is just trying to tell a good story and
thinks that recognizable props will do it better. The modern world
is helpful to the narrative, but not the subject of a tract.
</P>
<P>
   As soon as the metaphor ceases to tell the story, Flimm abandons
it. Wotan's spear is an accessory to his gray business suit and
lies across the architect's drawing board in ``Das Rheingold.''
There are real giants (albeit got up like American Indians); real
swords, not tommy guns; real shields instead of bulletproof vests.
Are the Rhinemaidens waterfront hookers or bathing beauties in
one-piece suits from Bayreuth's local H&AMP;M? I don't think we are
being asked to decide.
</P>
<P>
   Fafner in dragon form is a curiously writhing rock formation.
Elsewhere, Wonder has built walls as arcs that rotate and enclose.
Bruennhilde's resting place is a tall cylinder, the Magic Fire a
red band that encircles it.
</P>
<P>
   Most people seemed delighted by the simplicity and originality
of ``Das Rheingold'' and ``Die Walkuere,'' but Flimm ran into
trouble at Saturday's ``Siegfried,'' and his stock continued to
decline, bottoming out with the wave of boos at the end of
``Goetterdaemmerung.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Siegfried'' dragged, but then almost any interpretation of it
does. And by the time this third ``Ring'' opera arrived, Wonder's
visual coups had lost any power to amaze. The singing was more
damaging. Such is the labor shortage for ``Ring'' productions that
intendants seek out not the ideal talent, but the least
objectionable. Bayreuth is at least fortunate in its Wotan; Alan
Titus gathered command and confidence with every appearance.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Placido Domingo and Waltraud Meier played Siegmund and
Sieglinde, one bringing luxurious delivery to Act I of ``Die
Walkuere,'' the other white heat. Meier, who blasted the festival's
competence in a farewell press interview, contributed her customary
hair-raising intensity to the stage. Domingo's nicety of
articulation and beauty of sound may not be Wagnerian, but they
have much to teach any Wagner tenor.
</P>
<P>
   Unfortunately, Gabriele Schnaut is battle-scarred by a few too
many Bruennhildes. She was ferociously loud, and her wobble so
favored its upper extreme that the impression was of persistent
sharpness. Schnaut's Bruennhilde bore down on the helpless listener
like a sopranic freight train threatening derailment at any moment.
</P>
<P>
   Schnaut was at least in better control of her assets than her
counterpart, Wolfgang Schmidt. The people who hired Schmidt surely
knew his shortcomings, but I don't think they deserved his
near-collapse at the end of ``Siegfried.''
</P>
<P>
   In ``Goetterdaemmerung'' he became merely coarse, a distinct
improvement. When Schmidt sang quietly, one heard remnants of a
once-attractive tenor voice. But Wagner is a notorious destroyer of
techniques. In moments of pressure this Siegfried could offer only
strangled desperation. When we were lucky, Schmidt landed on no
pitch at all, creating a kind of 19th-century German Romantic rap.
</P>
<P>
   Flimm, to his credit and our relief, had coached both singers
into theatrical believability, but their performances did not repay
him well. Yet rest assured that neither singer has squandered
further chances for employment. Wagner roles constitute a seller's
market, and casting them is the art of the possible.
</P>
<P>
   The production had better luck elsewhere, especially in Guenter
von Kannen, a marvelously blowsy and disreputable Alberich, and in
John Tomlinson's Hagen, which did much to rescue
``Goetterdaemmerung.'' Birgit Remmert in the tailored suits of a
soccer mom created a Fricka of dignity and poise. Mette Ejsing as
Erda boomed attractively. Violeta Urmana, so effective as Kundry in
``Parsifal,'' was a finely passionate Waltraute in
``Goetterdaemmerung.'' Others (Philip Kang as Fafner, Michael
Howard as Mime) were certainly acceptable.
</P>
<P>
   Giuseppe Sinopoli seemed a strange choice to conduct the
``Ring.'' The Bayreuth acoustical aesthetic (clear, resonant vocal
sound in a largely wooden enclosure; warm, almost muffled orchestra
sound emanating from a covered pit) does not exactly play into this
conductor's hands. Sinopoli is small, thin and nervous, and his
music-making sounds much the same. I admired some of the nearly
out-of-control passions surrounding Siegfried's death and also
forgave a lot of ragged ensemble work and vague accompaniments.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe Sinopoli's prominent winds and brass and his noticeably
reticent string sound (more expansive in ``Goetterdaemmerung'')
were the proper companions for Flimm's high-tech production.
Sinopoli sustained a lot of booing after ``Siegfried,'' appeared
for only one curtain call and did not appear at Saturday's news
conference.
</P>
<P>
   Flimm's production seems caught in the center of a long-running
war over Wagner style, and this is one instance where the middle of
the road guarantees no safety. Radical revisionists want his
``Ring'' to dare and provoke more than it does. Others, like the
American millionaire and patron I overheard at intermission,
consider Flimm ``eccentric.''
</P>
<P>
   This production also appears in the midst of yet another power
struggle for control of Bayreuth. Blustery and combative at 80,
Wolfgang Wagner, the composer's grandson, holds on. But his
attackers this year are not only family members, but also
distinguished Bayreuthians like the bass Hans Sotin, who withdrew
from ``Parsifal,'' and Meier, who has made no bones about her
disgust with current policy. Wagner has been bolstered by a large
sum of American money to produce a new ``Tannhaeuser'' two years
from now.
</P>
<P>
   It is in such turmoil that Flimm has had to operate. Some of the
operas, ``Siegfried'' especially, need work, but once the clamor
for spectacle has died down and a more acceptable Bruennhilde and
Siegfried have been found, Wagnerites might find that this is a
``Ring'' that tells its story rather well.

A pleasing `Shower'
<TEXT>
<P>
   By ERIC HARRISON
</P>
<P>
   Houston Chronicle
</P>
<P>
   Five minutes into ``Shower,'' a touching new film from China,
you pretty much know how it's going to end. For maybe half the
movie, this seems like a serious strike against it. But then,
gradually, something begins to happen.
</P>
<P>
   Telling details of what life is like for the working-class
characters slowly begin to accumulate. Daily rituals grow in
resonance. Our affection for the place (Beijing) and its people
deepens.
</P>
<P>
   Gradually, the familiarity starts to feel like less of a
liability. I came to appreciate this movie the way I would a new
recording of a fine old song: The melody's the same, but it's a
different arrangement, and the singer brings to it shadings that no
other singer could.
</P>
<P>
   It would be more accurate to compare ``Shower'' to an ancient
fable or parable. It's the Prodigal Son with a twist.
</P>
<P>
   Stories similar to that New Testament tale exist in Buddhism and
other religions, and the basic outline appears again and again in
literature and film. It is one of our primary myths that carries a
wisdom recognized in every culture.
</P>
<P>
   In ``Shower,'' Da Ming, a successful businessman in a modernized
region of China, returns to the scuffed-up corner of Beijing in
which he was born; a postcard sent by his mentally disabled brother
had made it appear that their father had died.
</P>
<P>
   Played by Pu Cun Xin, who appeared in ``The Blue Kite,'' Da Ming
plainly is uncomfortable with his past and relations. His wife, who
we never see, doesn't even know about his brother's mental
handicap.
</P>
<P>
   The father, Master Liu (Zhu Xu, who starred recently in ``King
of Masks''), runs a deteriorating bathhouse that is the center of
life to a community of men who cling to the old ways. It is their
refuge, a place of companionship and peace where they go to bicker,
to stage cricket fights and to have their hurts massaged away.
</P>
<P>
   Da Ming, used to a faster pace, takes showers. The looks
exchanged between him and his father speak eloquently of old wounds
and reproaches, of lingering fears, and finally of love.
</P>
<P>
   Watching the simple, uncomplicated affection and joy that Liu
shares with his other son, Da Ming begins to long for same; he
misses the safe harbor of family. At the same time, he comes to
appreciate the important position his father and the bathhouse hold
in the community. Master Liu acts as priest, doctor and
psychologist, attending to the spiritual, physical and emotional
needs of his flock, and he takes his roles very seriously.
</P>
<P>
   Through the eyes of Da Ming, we see the way people live their
lives, the little rituals and details that make up their days _ the
leisurely talks, the daily rubdowns, the recurring conflicts. He,
like us, is an outsider to this culture, made that way by his long
exile.
</P>
<P>
   The story isn't moved along by dialogue or by the linear
propulsion of plot so much as by repetition. We mark changes in
characters and mood by variations in routine _ someone new enters
the bathhouse or something happens to disrupt the natural order of
things. Or a character falters, and another steps in to ensure that
things continue.
</P>
<P>
   As mundane as these rituals are, it is their repetition that
forms the foundations of these characters' lives, just as they also
form the basis of a culture. Their accumulation in this movie
generates a power greater than any single event. It is almost
magical. That makes the men who perform the rituals shamans.
</P>
<P>
   When Da Ming becomes reintegrated into this world, he approaches
a state of almost spiritual grace.

 &HT;    FLORIDA DELEGATE SKIPS CONVENTION TO RAISE MONEY
 &HT;    By MARCIA GELBART
 &HT;    c.2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHILADELPHIA _ State Rep. Mike Fasano is one of Florida's 80
alternate delegates here, but as of Wednesday he still had not set
foot on the convention floor.
</P>
<P>
   That's because the New Port Richey Republican, who is
coordinating his party's state House campaigns, has been spending
his time in the lobby of the Loews Philadelphia Hotel, joining
state Rep. Tom Feeney, R-Oviedo, in meetings with big GOP
contributors.
</P>
<P>
   By Friday, Fasano expects to have enriched the Republican Party
of Florida by $100,000. ``Being 1,000 miles away from the state of
Florida, that's a very good thing,'' he said Wednesday at a Florida
GOP breakfast.
</P>
<P>
   By giving to the party, contributors are not limited to the $500
donation caps they would face if they gave to individual
candidates. Republicans control the House 75-45, and Feeney expects
his party's numbers to stay the same or increase by no more than
six, despite the 51 open House seats being contested because of
term limits.
</P>
<P>
   On Tuesday and Wednesday, Fasano and Feeney hosted more than a
half dozen small events, usually with just four or five people
apiece.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're individuals who want to give money to our House
campaigns,'' said Fasano, though he declined to give names. Their
identities will become known in a few weeks, though, since election
laws require political parties to identify their contributors.

ECONOMIC SCENE: ONCE WIDELY HELD `EFFICIENT MARKETS' THEORY IS
QUESTIONED 
</HEADLINE>
   By JEFF MADRICK   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Back in the 1970s, the efficient-markets hypothesis was an
article of near-religious faith. As an economics student, I
certainly bought the argument whole. ``There is no other
proposition in economics which has more solid empirical evidence
supporting it,'' concluded Michael Jensen, a leading proponent of
this school of thought, in 1978.
</P>
<P>
   What the efficient-markets hypothesis principally meant was that
you could not beat the market. Economists generally agreed that
financial markets processed all new information about securities so
efficiently that no one could get a consistent advantage over other
investors. In other words, stock prices fairly reflected their true
value most of the time. Better to buy an index fund that replicated
the broad stock market averages like the Standard &AMP; Poor's 500.
</P>
<P>
   But economists are increasingly challenging the orthodoxy. A
growing number argue that according to the best new evidence,
financial markets do not appear all that efficient after all. My
immediate reaction is to wonder how much my eminent professors cost
me by convincing me that I could not outperform the averages. An
investment of $5,000 in an index fund, earning about 10 percent a
year since 1975, would have grown to $50,000 or so by now. But if I
had invested with George Soros or Warren Buffett and earned maybe
30 percent a year (delusions of grandeur, I grant, but it serves as
an example), that $5,000 would have run up to $3.5 million.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, if markets are not as efficient as once thought, there
are more important consequences than my personal financial loss.
Being less efficient suggests that speculative and dangerous stock
market bubbles are entirely possible and even likely, that the
federal authorities must remain vigilant about the complete and
open flow of information, and that the stock market does not
necessarily allocate capital investment to the right places.
</P>
<P>
   The best summary of the position is found in a new book,
``Inefficient Markets'' (Oxford University Press), by the Harvard
professor Andrei Shleifer. Shleifer is no outsider to the economics
establishment. He is the recent winner of the John Bates Clark
award, given to an outstanding economist under 40. He was an
influential proponent of the swift and highly debated introduction
of free markets in Russia, known as shock therapy.
</P>
<P>
   Make no mistake about the efficient-markets hypothesis. As
Shleifer makes clear, it is a powerful idea. Economists did not
argue that all investors had to be rational for the market to work
efficiently. Rather, they figured the mistakes of investors often
offset one another. More important, even if investors pushed stocks
out of line, there were enough well-informed investors who would
sell the overvalued stocks and buy the undervalued ones. They would
thus set stock prices right again _ and, through arbitrage
techniques, they would take little risk in doing so.
</P>
<P>
   Probably the most important factor among evidence supporting the
thesis is that, adjusting for the amount of risk taken, economists
showed that almost no professional money manager actually beat the
market over time. If anyone did, it was considered pure luck _ like
a gambler rolling seven 10 times in a row.
</P>
<P>
   Beginning in the 1980s, more sophisticated research uncovered
unsettling anomalies. To take just one example, stocks that
performed poorly in one period typically did better on average over
time. If markets were truly efficient, well-informed investors
should have sprung into immediate action and bought those poorly
performing stocks well before anyone had a chance to make a big
profit.
</P>
<P>
   It increasingly became clear, even to economists, that human
behavior _ sometimes irrational _ affected stock prices. A long
period of bad news could indeed induce investors to drive stocks to
irrationally low prices, as happened in the 1970s. A long period of
good news could induce them to buy at ever-higher prices, creating
a bubble.
</P>
<P>
   As for those well-informed investors who would correct stock
prices, Shleifer argues that in real life, riskless arbitrage is
virtually impossible in markets with thousands of securities.
</P>
<P>
   Evidence is persuasive that stocks often move whether or not
their true value changes. For example, Shleifer notes, America
Online rose by nearly 20 percent in late 1998 simply because it was
announced that it would be included in the S&AMP;P 500. This certainly
did not reflect a change in the fundamental value of AOL.
</P>
<P>
   Not all economists have accepted this new heterodoxy, of course.
But a growing number have climbed aboard a wagon driven by a few
brave pioneers, including Richard Thaler of the University of
Chicago, Robert Shiller of Yale, Richard Roll of the University of
California at Los Angeles and now Shleifer.
</P>
<P>
   So if Shleifer and his mentors are right, there are
opportunities to beat the averages. Maybe an investor like Soros,
who often invested against the dominant psychological grain of the
moment, was not just a lucky risk-taker after all.
</P>
<P>
   That the federal authorities should be more concerned with
swings in the market means, in part, more diligent efforts to
assure that all relevant information is made public. It means
closer scrutiny of the books by federal investigators. It means
strict accounting standards. Henry Kaufman, the former Salomon
Brothers economist, is especially worried that the authorities are
not vigilant enough these days.
</P>
<P>
   In my view, it also means that higher margin requirements and
other credit restrictions on funds available for investment should
be considered when markets reach dizzying heights.
</P>
<P>
   Shleifer also says both evidence and theory suggest that many
investors do poorly in the market over time because they chase the
latest fashion. If so, he argues, we should think twice about
encouraging plans to privatize Social Security that will require
average Americans to manage their own money.
</P>
<P>
   For those who wonder whether the academic skirmishes among
economists really matter, here is a good example. An ideological
attachment to market efficiency can lead to damaging conclusions
about such diverse policies as Social Security privatization and
federal oversight. The good news is that economists themselves are
coming to the rescue.

LARGEST PROXY-SOLICITATION FIRM ACQUIRES A RIVAL 
</HEADLINE>
   By ANDREW ROSS SORKIN   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Two of the biggest companies that solicit proxies
from shareholders during major mergers and acquisitions are doing a
deal of their own.
</P>
<P>
   Georgeson Shareholder Communications, the world's largest proxy
solicitations company, will announce Thursday that it has acquired
Corporate Investor Communications, the third largest firm in the
rather insular industry of shareholder communications. Terms of the
deal are not expected to be disclosed.
</P>
<P>
   As consolidation continues across most major industries at a
quick clip, companies like Georgeson and CIC work with the affected
companies to communicate with their shareholders about their deals.
</P>
<P>
   According to the two companies, their deal will give them the
capacity to communicate with more than 100 million shareholders a
year by mail, e-mail, telephone, fax and the Web. The combined
company communicates with 200,000 shareholders a day by phone,
representing 3,000 corporate clients and dealing with most of the
mutual fund industry.
</P>
<P>
   While Georgeson, based in New York, is known for its proxy
solicitation business during hostile takeovers, CIC, based in
Carlstadt, N.J., works much more behind the scenes on major deals,
responsible for the actual printing and mailing of proxies, annual
earnings reports and such.
</P>
<P>
   William M. Crane, Georgeson's president, said the acquisition
was prompted by a fundamental change in his company's market. ``The
need of our clients has changed as the individual investor has
become a significant part of the market,'' he said.

   TATTOO YOU
</P>
<P>
   Q: I am an anesthesiologist. Last week, I had a young male
patient on the table for an apendectomy. As I was pushing the drugs
to put him to sleep, I noticed a Nazi flag tattoo enveloping his
upper arm. Being Jewish and having a grandmother who lost her
entire family to the Nazis, I was disturbed. What level of care
must an ethical physician provide to a patient he finds offensive?
</P>
<P>
   _ Anonymous, Atlanta
</P>
<P>
   A: You must give every patient proficient treatment. That is
your sworn obligation. It is not for you to judge your patients'
worth as people. You may find the tattoo an obvious emblem for the
man, but it's not. In fact, you know little about him except that
at some point in his life he got a tattoo expressing odious ideas;
you have no idea what he thinks now or what bad behavior, if any,
he has ever engaged in. You do know, on the other hand, that your
patient is probably too young to have been an active Nazi in the
war. Still, it is true that we all treat different people
differently. Plumbers, shopkeepers and the late General Patton have
been brusque with some people, solicitous with others. You, too,
are entitled to human feelings. But you must always be thoroughly
professional. If you can't do that, recuse yourself and let another
anesthesiologist handle the patient.
</P>
<P>
   Q: I will be starting college in a few months and wonder if I am
obligated to tell my dorm mate that I'm a lesbian. Is it wrong to
hide something that could be deemed significant, or may I keep my
sexual orientation to myself? If I do tell her, can I at least wait
until we know each other, so that she doesn't perceive it as my
defining feature?
</P>
<P>
   _ H.H., Gainesville, Fla.
</P>
<P>
   A: Sharing a room with someone does not mean relinquishing all
claims to privacy. You have no ethical obligation to discuss your
sexual orientation with your dorm mate. And while it is certainly
possible that someone may feel uneasy with a gay roommate or a
Jewish roommate or a black roommate, that's his or her problem. Of
course, sharing a room with someone makes her comfort your problem
too, so your sense of tact is well placed. That is, if you decide
to tell her, do it when you know each other well enough to feel at
ease sharing so intimate a confidence. Unless you are planning to
bring paramours back to the room your first week of school _ this
sounds awfully optimistic to me, but perhaps my own freshman
experience is not a reliable guide here _ there is no reason to
hasten this conversation. And if you never feel like telling her,
that's OK, too.
</P>
<P>
   Q: My garbage cans were stolen, contents and all, and dragged
down the street to a waiting van, trash spilling behind them. Was
it my responsibility to clean up the trash left on the street? I
feel as if I, the victim, was being made to pay for the crime
against me.
</P>
<P>
   _ Martin Golan, Montclair, N.J.
</P>
<P>
   A: You may not want to clean up, but if you don't, you'll be
walking in garbage. (It is unlikely that the thief will return to
tidy up.) Much of adult life entails responding to circumstances
not of our making. For instance, you have to shovel your sidewalk
even if you didn't seed the clouds or install the ski-resort
machinery that dumped a blanket of snow on it. This civic duty
comes with the house _ and in many cities is also a legal
obligation. But the real question is this: Why is someone stealing
cans of garbage? Have our nation's thieves completely lost their
way?

 &HT;    Delta adds executive to push diversity
 &HT;    By Scott Thurston
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Delta Air Lines has created a new executive-level post
to promote work force diversity.
</P>
<P>
   The airline named Belinda Stubblefield, previously director of
marketing planning, as vice president-global diversity. She will
push company efforts to ``attract and maintain a team of highly
skilled, diverse people who have full and equal opportunity to grow
as professionals,'' the airline said.
</P>
<P>
   Delta spokesman John Kennedy said the move wasn't prompted by
high-profile racial discrimination lawsuits against three other big
Atlanta employers: Coca-Cola Co., Georgia Power Co. and Lockheed
Martin Corp.
</P>
<P>
   He also said it was unrelated to complaints on behalf of five
black female Delta employees filed with the Equal Employment
Opportunity Commission by a lawyer connected to the Coke case.
</P>
<P>
   The EEOC complaints, which were filed in May and could grow into
a lawsuit, allege systemic discrimination in promotions,
evaluations and pay. The women are represented by Birmingham
attorney Byron Perkins, a co-counsel with Washington lawyer Cyrus
Mehri in the Coke case.
</P>
<P>
   Perkins, who wouldn't identify his clients, said it's no
coincidence Delta created a new diversity post and put an
African-American woman in it.
</P>
<P>
   ``This was definitely in response to my clients' EEOC charges
and probably others,'' he said. ``The timing is too close. What
they're doing is what I call 'blackening up' and getting ready for
a court fight similar to what Coke did.'' Coke formed a diversity
advisory council, headed by two top executives, after being hit
with the lawsuit. Georgia Power named a diversity action council
after it was sued last week.
</P>
<P>
   Kennedy wouldn't respond directly but noted that Delta first
established a diversity office in 1999. It was initially headed by
a general manager but now will be headed by Stubblefield.
Stubblefield, 37, joined Delta's marketing department last year.
Previously she was vice president-work force diversity at Nestle
USA Inc. and has also held marketing jobs at Nestle, Procter &AMP;
Gamble and IBM. The Michigan native is a graduate of UCLA and has
an MBA from Harvard.
</P>
<P>
   Delta Chairman Leo Mullin, in an employee memo accompanying the
announcement of Stubblefield's promotion, said diversity among
employees and suppliers is essential ``for any large, global
business that expects to thrive in the 21st century.''
</P>
<P>
   Mullin said ``Delta's diversity commitment has produced
significant results'' in both areas but will be more effective
under a vice president.
</P>
<P>
   As of April 1, minorities composed 22 percent of Delta's work
force of 74,741, according to figures previously released by the
airline. The proportion drops to 15 percent among managers and 5
percent among executives at the director level and above.

 &HT;    Lanky wide receiver Finneran hopes to parlay his size into a job
with the Falcons
 &HT;    By Ken Sugiura
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA - Brian Finneran might have made an excellent swimmer.
</P>
<P>
   His arms dangle down his sides. Striding down the field, his
legs gobble up ground. His long, narrow frame looks as if it would
slice through the water. He even comes from one of the sport's
hotbeds, Mission Viejo, Calif.
</P>
<P>
   Finneran wouldn't merit a second look on a pool deck. But he is
trying to make a living catching footballs, and, among those who
ply that trade, he stands out.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's been my niche,'' said Finneran, the 6-foot-5 wide
receiver who has been catching eyes by catching passes in the
Falcons training camp at Furman University.
</P>
<P>
   His height helped him win a scholarship to Villanova, where as a
senior he caught 96 passes and won the Walter Payton Award as the
most outstanding player in Division I-AA. It also might gain him
entry onto the Falcons' regular-season roster.
</P>
<P>
   Saturday against the Colts, Finneran caught four passes for 68
yards, including a 13-yard touchdown pass from Danny Kanell in the
fourth quarter to win the game for Atlanta 20-13.
</P>
<P>
   ``As long as the ball's thrown to you, you've got to make
plays,'' he said. ``That's what it's all about.''
</P>
<P>
   Finneran's height, reach, leaping ability and dependable hands
have endeared him to the Falcons passers.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've thrown some ``out'' routes that I thought were high, and
he just reached up and got them,'' quarterback Chris Chandler said.
``But he catches the low ones good, too.''
</P>
<P>
   Saturday, Kanell compared Finneran to two of the best receivers
in the league, Denver's Ed McCaffrey and Minnesota's Randy Moss.
Rookie Doug Johnson called Finneran ``the real deal.''
</P>
<P>
   Finneran has fended off Falcons defensive backs throughout camp,
``He's got the big body,'' defensive backs coach Greg Brown said.
``It's hard to reach around him and make a play when you're a
small, little defensive back.''
</P>
<P>
   Finneran is one of only nine wide receivers on an NFL roster
this summer who is 6 feet 5 inches. He is four inches taller than
the Falcons' next tallest wideout, Jammi German. As a whole, the
Falcons' pass-catching corps is more point guard than small
forward. Starters Shawn Jefferson and Terance Mathis are 5 feet 11
inches and 5 feet 10 inches, respectively. Tim Dwight is 5 feet 8
inches.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can just kind of throw it up there in his area,'' Chandler
said, ``and he usually comes down with it.''
</P>
<P>
   Finneran isn't a cinch to make the team. Jefferson, Mathis and
Dwight probably have spots. Finneran is one of four going for
probably two slots, and coach Dan Reeves called wide receiver the
most competitive position in camp.
</P>
<P>
   Finneran undoubtedly is motivated by the experience of having
been let go in the past. In 1998, he signed with Seahawks as an
undrafted free agent, and was cut. He didn't play that season, but
after tearing up NFL Europe he was picked up by the Eagles last
summer.
</P>
<P>
   However, he bobbled a crucial pass in the first game of the 1999
season, and the Eagles sent him packing four weeks later. He hung
around Philadelphia, practicing on his own, going to four tryouts
and working two weeks on a construction site, before the Falcons
signed him to their practice roster in December.
</P>
<P>
   Despite his impressive performance last week against the Colts,
Finneran knows that he needs to continue to impress the Falcons'
coaching staff Saturday against the Cowboys in Tokyo and in the
three preseason games following.
</P>
<P>
   ``Just make the team,'' he said. ``That's the goal.''

CABLE TAKES UP MANTLE OF TV FILMS, AS TRADITIONAL NETWORKS LOOK TO
REALITY 
</HEADLINE>
   By BERNARD WEINRAUB   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   HOLLYWOOD _ FX is one of those cable networks that many channel
surfers glide past because it offers reruns of enduring hits like
``NYPD Blue,'' ``The X-Files'' and ``Married with Children.''
</P>
<P>
   But Peter Liguori, president of FX Networks, which is owned by
the News Corp., said that like other cable stations, FX was trying
to get more attention and reinvent itself in the face of an
increasingly competitive network arena obsessed with reality
programs like CBS's ``Survivor'' and quiz shows like ABC's ``Who
Wants to be a Millionaire.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Original television movies are now being minimized in the
world of the networks,'' Liguori said. ``This opens up
opportunities in the world of basic cable to fill the void.''
</P>
<P>
   The result is a provocative FX drama, ``Deliberate Intent,''
which will have its premiere 8 p.m. Sunday, the first dramatic film
on a network not known for original films.
</P>
<P>
   FX is hardly alone. MTV, VH-1 and E! Entertainment _ which are
known for their music videos, lightweight interviews and
documentaries _ are joining the ranks of HBO, Showtime, TNT,
Lifetime, A&AMP;E and other stations in the quest for audiences seeking
dramatic films and series. ESPN, the sports network, is also
considering making dramatic films.
</P>
<P>
   The reason is straightforward: cable networks like MTV and E!
want to solidify and expand their audiences by moving into new
areas like dramatic shows.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's ironic that cable and the broadcast networks are coming
from different directions and moving toward the middle _ the
broadcast networks once had scripted and fiction shows, and are now
moving towards the reality side, while the cable networks are
moving from reality to fiction,'' said Mindy Herman, president and
chief executive of E! Networks, which is planning 10 to 15 series
and four to six films a year.
</P>
<P>
   Similarly, Brian Graden, president of programming at MTV, said
the network was adding dramatic shows and series to its mix of
music videos and interviews, largely aimed at 12- to 24-year-olds.
Starting Wednesday at 10 p.m., MTV will offer a 13-part series
called ``Live Through This,'' a multigenerational drama about a
reunited rock band of the '70s that goes back on tour accompanied
by their teen-age children.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're certainly crossing the line, creating dramas and series
around music,'' Graden said. ``MTV is such a special brand that as
the head programmer, I want to take it slowly. We don't want to put
all our eggs in one basket. Our model is HBO. I want to make sure
that we don't end up as a traditional television channel.''
</P>
<P>
   Home Box Office, under its former chairman, Michael Fuchs, began
making films and series in 1983, serving as a model for other cable
networks. (HBO's first film was ``The Terry Fox Story,'' about a
one-legged runner, and its first series was ``Not Necessarily the
News,'' with news clips in sketch comedy).
</P>
<P>
   Though the broadcast networks are still dominant, in recent
years they have been envious of and a little irritated by HBO's
success with free-wheeling shows like ``The Sopranos'' and ``Sex in
the City,'' which have few constraints on language and sex, and are
the darlings of critics. Last year, despite 16 nominations, ``The
Sopranos'' did not win the best dramatic series award at the Emmys,
which has been taken as a sign of resentment toward HBO for its
daring treatment of sex and language. Instead, ``The Practice'' on
ABC won for the second straight year.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   For the cable networks, the risks of competing in this new arena
are largely financial. A two-hour drama on cable often costs $3
million to $5 million, and sometimes much more. A reality show may
cost $200,000. The payoff in producing dramatic shows, they hope,
is higher advertising rates and larger audiences.
</P>
<P>
   ``The risk is that these are expensive pieces of programming,
and we know how difficult the movie business is,'' Liguori said.
``What you hope to do is make intelligent bets and promote them
wisely. It's a high-risk reward for cable to do this, while
traditional networks are squeezing back on writing and storytelling
and heavying up on reality.''
</P>
<P>
   Beyond this, there's a more intangible risk for some cable
networks.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you don't create the right type of movie or drama and you
are a very branded channel like VH-1 or MTV or ESPN, then you risk
watering down your brand by providing the wrong type of product,''
said Jeffrey Gaspin, executive vice president of programming and
production at VH-1. ``So our movies are about music.''
</P>
<P>
   The VH-1 films have been about the lives of the Monkees, about
the performer Meat Loaf and about Ricky Nelson.
</P>
<P>
   To writers and directors struggling in the face of diminishing
numbers of dramas and series on network television, the entry of
cable into the arena is clearly a boon. FX, for example, plans four
films a year.
</P>
<P>
   ``It opens up a whole new world of venues where you can tell
stories that in some cases are edgy and will get attention, and are
certainly not what the networks are doing,'' said Andy Wolk, the
director and co-author, with Lisa Mohan, of the adaptation of
``Deliberate Intent.'' The harrowing legal drama is based on a book
by Rodney Smolla, a First Amendment lawyer and expert on
Constitutional law.
</P>
<P>
   The drama is a true story about a hit man hired by a former
Motown record executive to kill his ex-wife, their paraplegic son
and a nurse for insurance money that paid for the boy's medical
care. In murdering the three, the killer meticulously used the
details provided in a mail-order book called ``Hit Man: A Technical
Manual for Independent Contractors,'' published by Paladin Press.
The result was a lawsuit against Paladin Press and its owner, Peder
Lund, a former Green Beret.
</P>
<P>
   The cast includes Timothy Hutton as Smolla, who represented the
plaintiffs _ the victims' family _ in the groundbreaking lawsuit.
Other members of the cast include Ron Rifkin as another family
lawyer, and two well-known television actors, James McDaniel of
``NYPD Blue,'' who plays the former Motown executive, and Clark
Johnson of ``Homicide,'' who plays the killer for hire.
</P>
<P>
   Other networks joining the drama bandwagon include E!, which has
completed four films so far. One, ``Best Actress,'' a drama about
Oscar contenders, was presented last year about the time of the
Academy Award ceremonies. Another, ``Becoming Dick,'' about a
Hollywood actor who realizes that the only way to succeed is to
turn into a jerk, will be shown on Aug. 31.
</P>
<P>
   Herman, the president of E!, said that one factor easily
overlooked is what she calls the halo effect.
</P>
<P>
   ``Doing these movies does have an effect on your brand and your
position in the marketplace,'' Herman said. ``When you launch these
shows, you get higher ratings. You get more press and publicity. It
creates a halo for your network that hopefully trickles down to the
other shows you have.'' She added: ``Ten years ago HBO was the
archetype network when they started doing movies. It added a
certain cachet. We're learning from that.''
</P>
<P>
   Jeff Bewkes, HBO's chairman, said his network was not troubled
by the trend of cable networks to move into films and dramatic
series. During the last two years TNT and Showtime have sought to
compete with HBO: TNT last year announced a schedule heavy on
classics like ``Animal Farm,'' ``Don Quixote'' and ``David
Copperfield.''
</P>
<P>
   Bewkes said that the many cable networks creating feature film
and series ``should actually reinvigorate these genres.''
</P>
<P>
   ``They're right to do this, and I'm not surprised it's
happening,'' he said. ``A network needs to have distinct
programming. And movies and series are a way of doing that.'' He
added that HBO did not view just other cable networks as
competition. ``NBC, CBS, ABC and Fox are our competition too,'' he
said.

 &HT;    Dell Computer stock continues slide
 &HT;    By John Pletz
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ Dell Computer Corp. stock continued to tumble
Wednesday when one industry analyst downgraded the stock and fueled
continued speculation about whether the computer maker's growth is
slowing more than previously thought.
</P>
<P>
   After falling 5.4 percent Tuesday to $41.56 per share, Dell's
stock slipped another $2, or 4.8 percent, Wednesday to close at
$39.56. Since July 17, the stock has fallen $14, or 26 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Ashok Kumar, an analyst for U.S. Bancorp Piper Jaffray,
downgraded Dell to ``buy'' from ``strong buy.'' He questioned not
only the company's short-term prospects, but also suggested that
Dell's glory days of runaway growth and soaring stock price may be
behind it.
</P>
<P>
   Kumar, who has been sharply critical of Dell recently for its
acquisition last year of storage-technology company ConvergeNet,
questioned whether the PC maker can hit its own revenue-growth
targets.
</P>
<P>
   Dell spent the past year persuading Wall Street to lower
expectations for earnings and revenue growth to about 30 percent
annually from the 50 percent rate the company had enjoyed.
</P>
<P>
   Kumar wrote that while Dell might be able to meet the earnings
target, ``we are skeptical that the company will be able to meet
the 30 percent revenue-growth expectations on a sustainable
basis.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We continue to believe that Dell does not have adequate
earnings power in notebooks, server and nonsystem revenue to offset
the secular weakness in consumer and commercial desktops.''
</P>
<P>
   Dell, which is scheduled to report second-quarter results next
Thursday, did not comment. It is subject to ``quiet period''
restrictions that prohibit discussing company performance in
advance of quarterly earnings announcements.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts expect Dell to earn 21 cents per share, according to a
survey by First Call/Thomson Financial.
</P>
<P>
   In general, analysts remain bullish on Dell: 19 rate it a
``strong buy,'' while five call it a ``moderate buy,'' and four tag
it a ``hold,'' according to Zacks Investment Research Inc.
</P>
<P>
   Some analysts have been skittish about PC makers in general in
recent weeks since two market-research firms reported that the
industry's second-quarter sales were weaker than expected.
</P>
<P>
   IDC and Gartner Group's Dataquest both said overall
second-quarter shipments grew more slowly this year than in 1999,
though last year's results were unusually high because of buying in
advance of Y2K.
</P>
<P>
   Both firms also suggested that the U.S. and European markets,
which grew more slowly than the rest of the world, are beginning to
mature. That's of particular concern with Dell, which does 70
percent of its business in the United States and 21 percent in
Europe.
</P>
<P>
   IDC estimated last week that Dell actually lost a very small
percentage of market share in the Europe/Middle East/Africa segment
during the second quarter, slipping to 9.1 percent from 9.3 percent
a year ago. Its shipments increased 6.4 percent from a year ago,
slightly below the overall market rate of 9.6 percent.
</P>
<P>
   TheStreet.com reported Tuesday that another analyst, Andrew Neff
of Bear Stearns, also raised some concerns about Dell's short-term
revenue prospects in a note to the firm's staff. Neff did not put
out a note to clients.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's probably some concern over the IDC numbers, and the
slower rollout of Windows 2000. That's more of a fourth-quarter
story,'' David Bailey, an analyst who follows Dell for Gerard
Klauer Mattison, said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   More important to investors, Kumar questioned whether Dell's
stock _ which split six times between October 1995 and March 1999 _
will break out of the $35-$60 funk it's been in for the past 18
months.
</P>
<P>
   ``The stock does not possess anywhere near the momentum it did
in 1997/1998,'' he wrote. ``The stock has now dropped below its
two-year, moving-average line, at $42, which is beginning to
flatten out. Bottom line _ real technical deterioration has set
in.''

CIRCUS LEGEND RESTLESS IN RECOVERY FROM BRAIN SURGERY 
</HEADLINE>
   By THOMAS BECNEL   
 Herald-Tribune, Sarasota, Fla.   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   VENICE, Fla. _ Like a restless tiger pacing the center ring,
Gunther Gebel-Williams prowls around his Venice home.
</P>
<P>
   The 65-year-old circus legend had surgery to remove a cancerous
brain tumor 3 1/2 weeks ago, but his family says that's not enough
to slow him down. Every morning Gebel-Williams goes in for
radiation treatment. Every afternoon he looks for something else to
do.
</P>
<P>
   ``The other day he came by my house and started vacuuming,''
says his daughter, Tina Del Moral, laughing and shaking her head.
``Then he was plucking weeds in the yard, and we're like, `C'mon,
Dad.'''
</P>
<P>
   His famous blond hair, shorn on the left side for surgery, is
slowly growing back. Friends say he remains tanned and fit, upbeat
as always.
</P>
<P>
   Gebel-Williams isn't doing interviews _ that's the one part of
circus life he never enjoyed _ but he is approaching recovery with
the single-mindedness he brought to his famous tiger-and-elephant
act. For years he was the greatest performer in ``The Greatest Show
on Earth'' _ the Ringling Bros. and Barnum &AMP; Bailey Circus.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Lord of the Ring'' retired from performing in 1990, but
has continued to tour and work behind the scenes with his son,
Mark, who inherited his father's tiger act. In December, when
Ringling begins rehearsals in Tampa for another tour,
Gebel-Williams would like to rejoin the circus.
</P>
<P>
   ``In his mind, he can do anything,'' says Kenneth Feld, the
Ringling owner who brought the German performer to America in 1969.
``He has done anything and everything; he's a historic
individual.''
</P>
<P>
   In Venice and nearby Sarasota, former winter headquarters of the
Ringling circus, plenty of people know just how big a star
Gebel-Williams is.
</P>
<P>
   For those who didn't grow up in a circus town, here's a clue.
Think Michael Jordan _ Michael Jordan and Cal Ripken.
</P>
<P>
   When people say ``Gunther,'' there's no doubt who they mean.
He's acknowledged as the finest wild animal trainer in circus
history, the man who broke the old mold of the lion tamer subduing
ferocious beasts with a whip and a chair.
</P>
<P>
   In the center ring, Gebel-Williams would coax a 500-pound tiger
into leaping onto the back of an elephant. He was lithe and sexy,
too, baring his chest, draping a leopard around his neck and
flashing a brilliant smile.
</P>
<P>
   For all the glamour, he was also astonishingly tough and
durable, even by the demanding standards of the traveling circus.
For more than 20 years and 12,000 performances, he never missed a
show.
</P>
<P>
   Feld often watched his star perform just hours after being
scratched or bitten, usually while trying to break up a fight
between animals. He needed hundreds of stitches during his career,
though he was never badly mauled by one of his big cats. Much
later, in 1996, he had heart valve replacement surgery.
</P>
<P>
   With Gebel-Williams, no matter what happened, the show went on.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'll never forget, in the late '70s, Memphis, Tennessee, his
foot was smashed, caught in a railroad coupling,'' said Feld. ``He
worked that night sitting in the first row with his foot propped
up, commanding the elephants with just his voice.
</P>
<P>
   ``That was the worst I saw him hurt, and the most amazing
performance.''
</P>
<P>
   Rodney Huey, Ringling vice president of public relations,
remembers Gebel-Williams on tour. Every day he'd ask the great
trainer how he was doing, and every day the answer was the same:
``Fantastic.''
</P>
<P>
   ``He was always larger than life,'' said Huey. ``Walking into a
room, walking into a hospital, he has a presence. I saw him the day
after surgery and we were talking. I asked him how he was doing,
and he said, `Fantastic.' ''
</P>
<P>
   Gebel-Williams' wife, Sigrid, says her husband is a surprisingly
good patient. He's trying to take it easy, doing things like
watching his grandson swim in the family pool.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's never listened to anyone in his life, but he listens to
doctors,'' said Sigrid. ``He's just like a little lamb.''
</P>
<P>
   The circus star has been enjoying sports on TV. During Wimbledon
the family compared his close-cropped hair with Andre Agassi's.
They were all inspired by cancer survivor Lance Armstrong's victory
in the Tour de France.
</P>
<P>
   Gebel-Williams' cancer treatment will include more than six
weeks of radiation therapy. Sometime in September he'll have
another MRI.
</P>
<P>
   The hardest thing about his time at home, family members agree,
is being apart from his son, the circus and the animals he's
trained and worked with for most of his life.
</P>
<P>
   His daughter, Tina, says the only animal around the house in
Venice is her black poodle, Mousi.
</P>
<P>
   Could it be? The great circus animal trainer, with time on his
hands, working with . . . a poodle?
</P>
<P>
   ``Not yet,'' she says, laughing, ``but I'm sure that'll come
up.''

 &HT;    SEC coaches think Vanderbilt has potential to stir up league
 &HT;    By Mark Schlabach
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA - This isn't the same old Vanderbilt.
</P>
<P>
   Just ask Florida coach Steve Spurrier, who was talking to
Commodores coach Woody Widenhofer at the Southeastern Conference's
spring meetings in Destin, Fla. Spurrier was telling Widenhofer
that Vanderbilt should have beaten his Gators last season when
Georgia coach Jim Donnan walked into the room.
</P>
<P>
   ``Yeah, they should have beaten us, too,'' Donnan said.
</P>
<P>
   In all, Widenhofer says his team could have won four more games
last season. The Commodores had fourth-quarter leads against
Alabama and the Bulldogs, and they outgained the high-powered
offenses of Florida and Kentucky by at least 100 yards each.
</P>
<P>
   The Commodores found a way to lose those games and finished 5-6.
It was the program's 17th consecutive losing season.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had a pretty good year last year in terms of building up
our confidence and esteem,'' said Widenhofer, who enters his fourth
season at Vanderbilt. ``We lost several close games. (But) it is
not the same old Vanderbilt. There's a new atmosphere at
Vanderbilt. Our players have gained a lot of confidence in
themselves and learned that they can win.''
</P>
<P>
   Vanderbilt's 1999 season wasn't completely fruitless. The
Commodores rallied from a 14-0 deficit to beat Mississippi in
overtime 37-34, the school's first SEC road victory in five years.
If not for a failed fake punt against Georgia, Vanderbilt might
have been playing in its first bowl game since 1982.
</P>
<P>
   ``I feel like we've turned the corner,'' Vandy tight end Elliott
Carson said. ``We haven't gone to a bowl game yet, but we had a
come-from-behind win and won an SEC road game last year. I think
we've gotten over the hump. We've just got to finish games. All of
the pieces are there.''
</P>
<P>
   They're certainly there on defense. Vandy returns nine starters
from a unit that ranked 24th nationally. Inside linebacker Jamie
Winborn is a candidate for All-America, and senior Jimmy Williams
is one of the SEC's top cornerbacks.
</P>
<P>
   Vanderbilt averaged 22.9 points per game last year, its highest
scoring output since 1987, and the offense should improve this
season. Quarterback Greg Zolman is being pressured by Florida
transfer Tim Olmstead and redshirt freshman Benji Walker. The
offensive line returns three starters and nine of the team's 10
linemen have had the benefit of redshirting.
</P>
<P>
   Highly regarded recruit Chris Young of Batesville, Miss., should
bolster a receiving corps that lost top pass-catcher Tavarus Hogans
to graduation.
</P>
<P>
   Vanderbilt will have to overcome one of the leagu. ``If they
ever start winning a few games, they might beat everybody.''

DRAGSTERS WRESTLE WITH A NEW IMAGE 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Calif.)   By RICH RUPPRECHT   
 NYT Regional Newspapers   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   SONOMA, Calif. _ Jerry Toliver drives a hot car and not just
because he leads the Funny Car point standings over the legendary
John Force.
</P>
<P>
   Toliver drives ``The Rock,'' the same name as the World
Wrestling Federation champion. Toliver, who is relatively new to
drag racing at age 49, heads the WWF drag racing team, which means
not just gearheads are hanging around Toliver's racing cars.
</P>
<P>
   Toliver is part of a tag team. Jim Epler drives the ``Kane''
car, also the name of a WWF wrestler.
</P>
<P>
   Force, Tolliver and Epler will be among the fan favorites here
this weekend at Sears Point in the NHRA Fram Autolite Nationals.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a definite crossover in the two sports,'' Toliver
said. ``We go to a lot of the wrestling matches and they come to
some of our races.''
</P>
<P>
   While no official surveys have been done, it doesn't take a
rocket scientist to figure out the male demographic group 12-34
will include many wrestling fans who are also drag racing buffs.
</P>
<P>
   Toliver said he had met people connected with the WWF through
bodybuilding and later approached the William Morris talent agency,
which also happened to have the WWF as a client. A few months later
Toliver was walking around the race circuit, holding up The Rock's
world championship belt.
</P>
<P>
   Toliver was born in Compton, Calif., and grew up hanging around
his uncles Jack and Art Chrisman, who are members of the NHRA Drag
Racing Hall of Fame. His grandfather was the head of the racing
team.
</P>
<P>
   Toliver raced street hot rods as a youth, but said he never had
the money or backing to get into drag racing earlier in his life.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'd love to have done this 20 years ago, but the timing wasn't
right,'' Toliver said. NHRA competition is not cheap. The top teams
will spend $5 million a year.
</P>
<P>
   Toliver spent seven years in drag boat racing, competing in the
Alcohol Hydro category for the International Hot Boat Association.
Toliver went over 220 mph in the boats, but in 1995 broke his back
and hand in a crash. He switched to conventional drag racing the
next year.
</P>
<P>
   ``I always wanted to be in a car, but economically it just
wasn't possible until then,'' said Toliver, who is CEO of the
Toliver Corp., a chemical transfer and packaging company with
terminals on the East and West coasts. What began as a one-man
company is now a multi-million dollar business. It enabled Toliver
to fulfill his drag racing dream.
</P>
<P>
   During the 1997 season Toliver purchased Gary Clapshaw's Funny
Car operation and then received his Nitro Funny Car license in
January of 1998. Later that year he obtained sponsorship from Mad
Magazine/DC Comics/Warner Bros. The cars of his team were the
Alfred E. Neuman and Spy vs. Spy racers. Suddenly, fans were paying
attention to Toliver's team.
</P>
<P>
   Toliver then acquired the more lucrative WWF sponsorship before
last season.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think the Mad Magazine operation kind of opened their
eyes,'' Toliver said of Vince McMahon's WWF. ``My budget got much
bigger.''
</P>
<P>
   What Toliver accomplished was to link up with one of the most
popular forms of entertainment (some bristle when you call
wrestling a sport) around.
</P>
<P>
   The same time Martha Stewart went public with stock offerings,
so did the WWF. Wrestling is just one part of what is officially
called World Wrestling Federation Entertainment Inc. ``It's kind of
like a soap opera,'' Toliver said of WWF wrestling. ``I watch it
and I think a lot of people have their favorite wrestlers and want
to know how they're doing.''
</P>
<P>
   Last year Toliver, wrestler Steve Austin, the ``Stone Cold'' car
that Toliver drove, and the WWF racing team appeared on the ``Regis
and Kathie Lee Show.''
</P>
<P>
   Last year when Toliver drove the ``Stone Cold'' Steve Austin
Funny Car, Epler drove ``The Undertaker.'' No word yet on the names
of next year's cars.
</P>
<P>
   Toliver won his first NHRA Funny Car race on the last week of
the 1999 season. This year he's won three times and reached the
finals six times.
</P>
<P>
   Last weekend in Seattle he lost a close match with Force in the
semifinals. Toliver said his close friendship with Force turns to a
strong rivalry only when they climb into their race cars.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's a great ambassador of the sport,'' Tolliver said. ``I
consider him a best friend.''

MUSEUM GROUP ISSUES GUIDELINES ON EXHIBITIONS OF PRIVATE ART 
</HEADLINE>
   By DAVID BARSTOW   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Responding to criticism over the financing of last year's
``Sensation'' exhibition at the Brooklyn Museum of Art and shows
like it, the American Association of Museums announced Wednesday
that it had adopted new ethical guidelines on how museums should
oversee displays of art borrowed from private collections.
</P>
<P>
   The new guidelines advise against some of the practices used by
the Brooklyn Museum in its staging of ``Sensation,'' an exhibition
of British contemporary art drawn from the collection of Charles
Saatchi, the London advertising magnate.
</P>
<P>
   But more broadly, the guidelines provide strong counsel on how
museums across the country should finance and supervise such
exhibitions at a time when museums rely increasingly on donations
from art dealers, corporations, auction houses and wealthy
collectors who all stand to gain from public displays of art in
which they have a private commercial interest.
</P>
<P>
   The guidelines were adopted during a July 13 board meeting of
the association. The board voted unanimously but withheld an
announcement about the vote until the association had informed its
membership, which includes 3,000 museums and 11,400 museum
professionals and trustees.
</P>
<P>
   The guidelines, voluntary for now, are likely to be adopted by
the association's accreditation commission. If so, museums could be
denied accreditation _ and risk losing financial support from
governments and foundations _ if they failed to follow the
guidelines.
</P>
<P>
   ``There was a lot of confusion in the field about what was best
practice,'' said Edward H. Able Jr., president and chief executive
officer of the association.
</P>
<P>
   By adopting the new guidelines, he said, the association hopes
to bolster public confidence in museums and also demonstrate to
lawmakers that museum professionals are eager to devise their own
rules to deal with the potential conflicts of interest often
inherent in exhibitions of private collections.
</P>
<P>
   Although such issues have long been debated quietly within the
art world, the ``Sensation'' exhibition was the catalyst for a
major reexamination of museum ethics, and the new guidelines mark
the first attempt to reach an industry-wide consensus on how such
conflicts should be addressed, museum executives said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   ``It would be a mistake,'' Able said, ``to say that the Brooklyn
Museum of Art exhibition did not prompt us to decide to take a
close look at this.''
</P>
<P>
   Arnold Lehman, director of the Brooklyn Museum of Art, is on
vacation and did not respond Wednesday to telephone messages
seeking his comment, nor did other senior executives at the museum.
Other museum officials, though, welcomed the new guidelines.
``There are occasionally lines that have to be drawn, not only in
the sand but also in the bedrock on issues of curatorial
integrity,'' said Harold Holzer, vice president for communications
at the Metropolitan Museum of Art. ``This can't be anything less
than healthy for the field.''
</P>
<P>
   The ``Sensation'' exhibition first drew criticism from Mayor
Rudolph W. Giuliani and Roman Catholic leaders for including an
artwork depicting the Virgin Mary decorated with elephant dung.
Later, Giuliani accused the museum of colluding with Saatchi to
inflate the value of Saatchi's vast art collection, and the museum
faced scrutiny for financing the exhibition in large measure
through donations from those who stood to profit from the art.
</P>
<P>
   Lehman did not make public Saatchi's role as the single largest
financial backer of ``Sensation.'' When that relationship was
disclosed in news accounts, Lehman explained that he had concealed
Saatchi's $160,000 pledge because Saatchi had asked that his
donation remain anonymous.
</P>
<P>
   The new guidelines, however, state that museums should adopt
policies that uphold ``the ideal of transparency.'' Specifically,
the guidelines state, museums ``should make public the source of
funding where the lender is also a funder of the exhibition.''
</P>
<P>
   ``If a museum receives a request for anonymity,'' the guidelines
continue, ``the museum should avoid such anonymity where it would
conceal a conflict of interest (real or perceived) or raise other
ethical issues.''
</P>
<P>
   Able put it this way: ``You need to be honest and open _ full
disclosure.''
</P>
<P>
   The guidelines also say that museums ``should retain full
decision-making authority over the content and presentation of the
exhibition.''
</P>
<P>
   In the ``Sensation'' exhibition, Lehman gave Saatchi a central
role in determining the artistic content of ``Sensation,'' to such
an extent that senior museum officials repeatedly expressed
concerns that Saatchi had taken control of the exhibition.
</P>
<P>
   According to the guidelines, the role of lenders like Saatchi
should be limited to consultations over the ``objects to be
selected from the lender's collection and the significance to be
given to those objects in the exhibition.''
</P>
<P>
   In May the Metropolitan canceled a retrospective of the work of
Coco Chanel, the French fashion designer, partly because of a
dispute over artistic control and commercial sponsorship. Museum
curators bristled at the demands from the House of Chanel, a major
sponsor of the exhibition.
</P>
<P>
   Able predicted that the new guidelines would help smaller, less
powerful museums fend off similar requests from corporate sponsors
and wealthy collectors. ``In many cases it will protect museums _
particularly small and medium museums _ from unreasonable
demands,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Able said the guidelines were reflections of a new reality in
the world of museums and other nonprofit institutions. The public,
he said, is demanding more accountability, more openness.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the old days,'' he said, ``no one cared how we did our
work.'' &QL;

<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ There is a new fraternity growing within the clannish
New York Police Department, but most of its members are so ashamed
by what they share that they have never met and do not even know
one another's names.
</P>
<P>
   The reason is that all of them have the virus that causes AIDS.
</P>
<P>
   To their fellow officers, they are indistinguishable from the
rest of the 40,000 men and women who police New York City, but in
their own minds, AIDS has set them apart. For many, it weighs them
down not only with the fear of death, but also with a secret they
are desperate to keep from their fellow officers.
</P>
<P>
   They are afraid, they say, that they will be banished from the
wider police fraternity, a sort of blue reservoir of strength that
they are used to turning to for solace. They cannot imagine telling
their colleagues they have a disease that many officers believe is
an affliction only of gay men, drug addicts, prostitutes and the
homeless.
</P>
<P>
   ``The fear is that they would isolate you and cast you aside and
say they don't want to work with you,'' said an officer who tested
positive a year ago and has since watched as fellow officers, even
her friends, have treated HIV-positive prisoners with derision. ``I
wish the people I work with could know,'' the officer said, ``but I
just don't think they would understand.''
</P>
<P>
   The HIV-positive officers include a middle-age white man who
lives in the suburbs with his wife and children, who said he tested
positive for the virus after being bitten by an infected suspect; a
Hispanic single mother of two, who said she caught the disease from
her former husband, also a police officer; and a young black man
who is openly gay and says he is unsure how he contracted the
virus.
</P>
<P>
   Many companies, arts organizations and even professional sports
teams have been forced to deal with AIDS over the last 20 years.
Police departments are no different. Police officials in Chicago
and Los Angeles, for example, say that officers who are infected
with HIV or who have AIDS are treated like any other officer with a
serious illness.
</P>
<P>
   In New York City, officers who test positive for HIV can turn to
the department's Early Intervention program for counseling and
referrals, and to a police union group called the Members'
Assistance Program.
</P>
<P>
   Many are referred to a man who has become the department's
unofficial AIDS counselor, Stephen P. Yurcik, a retired officer who
tested positive in 1990 and saw his wife, also a New York police
officer, die from the disease two years later. Yurcik said he had
the backing of both the department and the police union for his
group, Positive Police.
</P>
<P>
   While the department cannot say how many officers have tested
positive for HIV or are already suffering from AIDS, Yurcik, the
police union and a gay officers' group estimate that there are
anywhere from two dozen to more than a hundred.
</P>
<P>
   Yurcik counsels 15 officers, referring them to treatment,
guiding them through their self-education about the virus and
sharing his experiences with them.
</P>
<P>
   Several of those 15 officers talked to a reporter on the
condition that their names and other identifying information be
withheld.
</P>
<P>
   Although by law workers cannot be compelled to tell their
employers that they have AIDS or any other disease, Yurcik said
that one of his messages was that they could trust the department.
</P>
<P>
   But even the officer who contracted the virus after being bitten
is adamant that his condition remain a secret, despite the
department's official acknowledgment that his illness resulted from
a line-of-duty injury, a risk faced by every officer who patrols
the streets.
</P>
<P>
   ``You've got to keep it to yourself,'' the officer said. ``It's
something you really don't want other people knowing, because you
don't want people to look at you differently.''
</P>
<P>
   The officer said he was devastated when he learned he had
contracted the virus, and he credits Yurcik for helping him and his
family through some of the most difficult times.
</P>
<P>
   Yurcik said he believed that greater awareness about officers
with AIDS and better education about the disease within the
department would encourage officers to come forward and,
eventually, would help reduce the stigma they feel.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know the cruelty and maliciousness of cops, their humor,''
Yurcik said. But he said he also knew the kindness of his fellow
officers, and he is still moved when he talks about the help he got
after his wife died.
</P>
<P>
   Yurcik said that in 1992, he told an officer he worked with that
his wife was dying of AIDS and that he had tested positive for HIV.
</P>
<P>
   ``I told him to go back and tell the guys. He went back and told
everybody,'' Yurcik said. ``They were totally blown away. And I
just got flooded with calls. And it was genuine _ you can tell with
these things.''
</P>
<P>
   He added, ``Most of the people that get the confidence to tell
their partners are surprised to see how they react.''
</P>
<P>
   That is a message that Patrick J. Lynch, the president of the
Patrolmen's Benevolent Association, also wants to get out. He said
that he had met with Yurcik and that he wanted him to address the
union's more than 500 delegates so they, in turn, could educate the
rank and file.
</P>
<P>
   But the officers who have tested positive for HIV say their
instinct to hide is only reinforced when they see their colleagues
treat HIV-infected citizens or prisoners with cruelty and
indifference.
</P>
<P>
   One officer listened to colleagues complain that their tax
dollars were being wasted on AIDS treatment and research.
</P>
<P>
   Two officers who agreed to be interviewed said their decision to
remain silent was greatly complicated by fears that if they
themselves were shot or injured, they could infect a colleague or
someone else.
</P>
<P>
   ``My God, what if I get cut?'' said the Hispanic officer who is
a single mother. ``What's going to happen? I was afraid of getting
someone else sick. What if I have a car accident?''
</P>
<P>
   Yurcik said that there were no documented cases of the disease
being spread through mouth-to-mouth resuscitation, and that even in
instances in which an officer was shot or badly cut, the likelihood
of a colleague's being infected from contact with the blood was
almost nil.
</P>
<P>
   Still, every officer is trained to take precautions, like
avoiding unprotected contact with blood by using equipment like
rubber gloves, which are standard issue in every patrol car, and
masks.
</P>
<P>
   Some of Yurcik's friends credit him with opening their eyes
about both disease and prejudice.
</P>
<P>
   Detective Frank R. Favilla, who grew up with Yurcik in Queens,
says his friend's illness has had a profound effect on him.
</P>
<P>
   ``My best friend is sick,'' he said, his eyes betraying some of
the sadness that has come with his education. ``The whole thing, it
changes you. You get older, you get wiser and you realize that
people aren't sick because they're bad people.''

   EDITORS: The New York Times is planning several pages of GOP
convention-related stories for Thursday, Aug. 3. The New York Times
News Service will file the following stories and photos tonight in
the ``p'' news file. Stories are scheduled to move by 9 p.m. ET.
For repeats or information, call 888-346-9867 or 212-556-1927.
HELD: GOP-DELEGATES.
</P>
<P>
   GOP-RDP-NYT (Philadelphia) _ A convention roundup: Gov. George
W. Bush makes his calibrated entry into Philadelphia on Wednesday
morning, the day delegates at the 37th Republican National
Convention are to select him as their nominee for president. Bush
and Dick Cheney are to receive their party's official nominations
tonight, and Cheney will speak to the convention.
</P>
<P>
   (EDS: An early, 900-word version of the roundup has moved and
will be updated with a longer version written by Richard L. Berke,
with quotes from late speeches; complete text of Dick Cheney's
speech will be available at the New York Times on the Web:
www.nytimes.com)
</P>
<P>
   With photos.
</P>
<P>
   GOP-BUSH-NYT _ Man in the News profile: Just six years ago, when
George W. Bush ran for governor of Texas, even his own parents
expected him to lose; it was his younger brother Jeb who held the
family's confidence. Friends and family members say that the elder
Bushes worried that George W. would be forced to bow again, as he
had several times before, to failure. But that story had a surprise
ending: While Jeb lost, George won. And in the process, George
Walker Bush launched himself, without any grand plan or intricate
forethought, on a trajectory that on Thursday will place him in the
spotlight as the Republican nominee for president, continuing along
what historians may some day recall as one of the most remarkable
paths ever taken to the White House. By Nicholas D. Kristof and
Frank Bruni.

   3,200 words; an abridged version will also move.

</P>
<P>
   GOP-CONSERVATIVES-NYT _ These are complicated times for social
conservatives. They feel they are winning on their core issues at
this convention, but some of them clearly miss the red meat
rhetoric and partisan edge of conventions past, replaced this week
by the Bush campaign's relentless appeal to the center. There was,
unmistakably, a wave of grumbling among conservative ranks, but
inside the conservative movement there is an overriding desire to
win in November. So social conservatives are focusing on the
victories they have won here _ a strong anti-abortion platform and
the selection of a conservative running-mate, Dick Cheney. By Robin
Toner. 1,300 words
</P>
<P>
   With photos NYT23, 24.

   GOP-FORD-NYT _ Former President Gerald Ford suffered a stroke
while attending the Republican National Convention but is described
by doctors as ``doing well.'' 1,000 words.

</P>
<P>
   GOP-MANAGERS-NYT _ How the convention managers are maintaining
discipline. Four years ago, speakers at the Republican convention
in San Diego were required to sign pledges promising to stick only
to the script approved by convention organizers. This year,
convention speakers _ all carefully screened in advance _ said they
have been told in the broadest guidelines what they should talk
about. They have also been told what they should NOT say: harsh
attacks that might invite comparisons to the Republican convention
of 1992. And while speeches are required by convention auditors, as
they are called, the main concern seems to be making sure that the
speakers keep to time, and not disrupt the snappy pace of a
convention that is meant to have the feel of a fast-paced
television spectacular. By Adam Nagourney. 1,200 words.
</P>
<P>
   With graphic.
</P>
<P>
   GOP-FRANKS-NYT _ In the land of the deep pockets, New Jersey's
Republican candidate for the Senate, Rep. Bob Franks, is the poor
man's candidate, scratching around for funds. By David M.

of black Americans. By Bob Herbert. 723 words. (Will be filed in

closed-door confrontation, became fast friends. Thursday night, in
the kind of bipartisan symbol coveted by the Bush presidential
campaign and more poignant to Texans that the rest of the country
will know, Jan Bullock, the widow of Democratic Lt. Gov. Bullock,
will introduce Bush as he accepts the GOP presidential nomination.

POPULARITY OF FANTASY PC GAME DIABLO II RIVALS HARRY POTTER'S
LATEST CHRONICLE 
</HEADLINE>
   By ALEX BERENSON   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   IRVINE, Calif. _ It came out just recently, a highly anticipated
sequel to a best seller filled with stories of wizards and
sorcerers. Revenue has topped $50 million so far, reviews have been
good, and fans, who waited impatiently for their new heroes to
arrive, are thrilled.
</P>
<P>
   ``Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire,'' right?
</P>
<P>
   Right _ and wrong.
</P>
<P>
   The fourth installment of the Harry Potter series is not the
only fantasy-filled hit this summer. On July 3, five days before
Harry Potter arrived in stores, Blizzard Entertainment, which is
based here, released Diablo II, a Dungeons and Dragons-like
computer game in which players battle a demon to save the world.
</P>
<P>
   So far, even though Blizzard marketed Diablo II only to serious
game players, it has sold more than 1 million copies worldwide, at
an average retail price of more than $50. The 70,000 copies of the
$70 collectors' edition, which was offered before the game was
officially released, have sold out.
</P>
<P>
   In terms of revenue, that puts Diablo II within striking
distance of the Potter book, which sold nearly 3 million copies in
its first weekend in stores, according to Scholastic, its
publisher, but often at deep discounts to the cover price of
$25.95. Diablo II is on track to be one of the top-selling computer
games.
</P>
<P>
   Yet Diablo II, which is designed for older teen-agers and
adults, has hardly registered on the media radar screen. And while
Potter and his creator, J.K. Rowling, have won praise around the
globe for drawing videogame-crazed and television-besotted young
people back to reading, games like Diablo II draw condemnation for
ensnaring players in a morbid worldview and gluing them
antisocially to a computer screen.
</P>
<P>
   ``A medal should be struck for Rowling,'' said the novelist
Sidney Sheldon, the former national spokesman for the Coalition for
Literacy, in a typical observation. ``For this woman to come along
and excite millions of children about reading today is a miracle.''
</P>
<P>
   Sheldon, whose sometimes steamy books have sold more than 300
million copies worldwide, said he believed that video games were
``getting so dark and so cruel; the object is to kill somebody, and
I think that is dreadful.''
</P>
<P>
   Diablo II is rated ``mature'' by the Entertainment Software
Rating Board, the equivalent of an R rating for a movie: few games
receive more restrictive ratings. A rating of mature means Diablo
II is supposed to be sold only to players who are 17 or older. But
many children and younger teen-agers play the game as well,
according to Mike Morhaime, president of Blizzard, a subsidiary of
Vivendi, the French company that is buying Seagram and its
Universal Studios operation in Hollywood.
</P>
<P>
   Still, while the game is hardly nonviolent, it is ``Harry Potter
and the Goblet of Fire,'' not Diablo II, that opens with the murder
of a 76-year-old man. And it is Diablo II, not ``Harry Potter,''
that gives young people worldwide the opportunity to interact with
each other in real time over the Internet, solving problems and
battling monsters together.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, many Diablo II players say they are also avid readers of
science fiction and fantasy. And like Harry Potter, the characters
in Diablo II are ultimately fighting evil.
</P>
<P>
   ``Harry Potter'' and games like Diablo II may have more in
common than many people realize, said Robert Coover, a Brown
University English professor and experimental novelist who is among
the leaders of efforts to find new ways to write on the Internet.
``I don't like the sense that book reading is good and computer
game playing is not,'' Coover said.
</P>
<P>
   In Diablo II, players pick one of five character types and then
try to complete increasingly difficult quests assigned to them by
computer-controlled characters in the game. There are four worlds
to conquer, and along the way, players must strengthen their
characters, finding better weapons and armor and learning new
skills they will need to battle increasingly sinister creatures. In
practice, players spend much of their time killing or dodging
skeletons, zombies and other monsters, and many of the quests are
themselves nothing more than hunting expeditions for evil
creatures.
</P>
<P>
   But in contrast to ``first-person shooter'' games like Doom, in
which players feel as if they are looking through the eyes of a
character whose sole purpose is to kill as many other players and
characters as possible, Diablo II is what video game experts call a
third-person game. In these, players view their characters and the
game's world from above, as if watching from a low-flying plane,
and the violence is not particularly graphic.
</P>
<P>
   ```Harry Potter' and Diablo II are both fantasy _ it's an escape
for people,'' said Bill Roper, a producer at Blizzard who helped to
lead the development of the game.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Diablo takes at least 50 hours to solve, according to Morhaime,
Blizzard's president. ``People take a lot of pride in their
characters,'' he said. ``There's a big sense of accomplishment.''
</P>
<P>
   In e-mail interviews, several players of Diablo II echoed that
view.
</P>
<P>
   ``For me, the hook is character development, and in Diablo's
case, hunting for items,'' wrote Caton Little, a 27-year-old player
from New Zealand. ``The story's not too important, although
hackneyed back-stories turn me right off.''
</P>
<P>
   As a measure of the seriousness with which some players treat
their characters, Blizzard's manual offers a special warning to
gamers who play Diablo in ``hard core'' mode, in which they cannot
revive characters killed during the game. As a result, one mistake
in hard-core mode can end weeks or months of a player's efforts.
</P>
<P>
   ``Blizzard Entertainment is in no way responsible for your
hard-core character,'' the manual tells players. ``Blizzard will
not and does not have the capability to restore any deceased
hard-core characters. Don't even ask. La-la-la-la-la, we can't hear
you.''
</P>
<P>
   Like many games, Diablo allows players to interact with each
other over the Internet, another part of its appeal, players said.
At Blizzard's Battle.net Web site, Diablo players can interact or
compete at no cost, joining each other's quests or battling for
supremacy.
</P>
<P>
   ``One of the assumptions that often gets made with computers is
that they alienate and isolate people,'' said Robert Nideffer, a
professor at the University of California at Irvine who specializes
in the study of art and computer science. ``In fact, players are
actively participating with other people in a very social space.''
</P>
<P>
   Nideffer is one of a small but growing group of academics,
including Coover of Brown, who argue that games are worthy of study
for what they tell about how people interact with computers and the
future of technology.
</P>
<P>
   The game market remains small compared with other media. About
170 million game cartridges and compact discs were sold last year,
compared with more than 1.5 billion general-interest books,
according to PC Data and the Book Industry Study Group.
</P>
<P>
   But while book sales are flat or declining and movie admissions
are barely rising, sales of games are surging. The number of games
bought for PCs tripled between 1993 and 1999, and for the first
five months of 2000, computer game sales are more than 10 percent
higher than last year, according to PC Data, a research firm in
Virginia.
</P>
<P>
   The growing game market has not escaped the attention of Warner
Brothers, which is working to develop a game based on the Harry
Potter series. At the same time, Blizzard is working with Pocket
Books to release a three-part series of books based on the Diablo
games.

<P>
   NEW YORK _ At a recent dance forum, Elizabeth Streb introduced
herself with considered clarity: ``Ten years ago I thought of
myself as someone who had a dance company. Today I think of myself
as someone who creates wild actions and movement moments in a show
that I sell.''
</P>
<P>
   Streb, artistic director of Streb, has never been a typical
choreographer. More like a daredevil, she gained recognition in the
mid-1980s for her gravity-baiting feats of physicality using
trampolines, gyroscopic belts and bungee cords. But like a true
postmodernist, she hated music (``too bossy'') and rejected
narrative. Her focus was on the abstract properties of pure
movement _ time, space and the body.
</P>
<P>
   For her new show, ``Action Heroes,'' parts of which will be
performed on Friday and Saturday at Vanderbilt Hall in Grand
Central Terminal, Streb has pumped up the spectacle with a
music-sound score and at least the semblance of a story. During the
70-minute show, the eight performers career through more than a
dozen episodes, including crashing though a pane of glass and
bouncing off walls. Streb has gone Vegas. Or, at least, that's
where she's headed.
</P>
<P>
   ``Action Heroes'' embeds new and familiar stunts into a
music-video-style format that pays homage to Streb's early
inspirations, like Evel Knievel, the motorcycle showman, Cannonball
Richards (he caught them in his gut) and Annie Edson Taylor, the
first person to survive Niagara Falls in a barrel.
</P>
<P>
   With ``Action Heroes,'' Streb leaves the dance world behind, at
least in economic terms. Her technical ambitions for its ultimate
development will be too costly for dance venues, so she is turning
to public spaces, commercial ventures and an earned-income business
model.
</P>
<P>
   The company's self-contained metal performance structure, a box
truss nearly 20 feet tall, is considered an exemplar of
market-driven strategies for nonprofit arts institutions by the
Joyce Mertz-Gilmore Foundation, which financed the portable stage
in 1998. The performance space _ complete with its own lighting,
moving walls, video screens and sound _ lets the company set up
cost effectively in any context. No longer limited to large,
traditional theaters, Streb productions can be marketed to broader
audiences and potentially yield more earned income.
</P>
<P>
   The line between performance and entertainment has blurred
considerably in the last few years. Riverdance, Matthew Bourne's
``Swan Lake'' and most notably the teaming of the experimentalist
Julie Taymor with Disney to produce Broadway's ``Lion King'' have
forged significant links between art and commerce.
</P>
<P>
   Streb, herself a hybrid of working class roots and MacArthur
Foundation ``genius grant'' credentials, cites Ringling Brothers
and Barnum &AMP; Bailey, Cirque du Soleil, Stomp, ``Bring In da Noise,
Bring In da Funk'' and Zingaro as precedents. The franchise scheme
used by Blue Man Group, the sly East Village trio that has
organized outposts in three other cities, she says, ``is radical
and very inspiring to everyone.''
</P>
<P>
   Streb was one of a number of downtown performance artists who
approached the Blue Man operation in the early 1990s, after it had
managed to break through to the mainstream media. Manuel Igrejas,
the press representative for Blue Man and now for Streb, had
learned that the public was ready for exciting new work. ``It was
starved,'' he recalls, ``for entertainment that moved it on a
fundamental level.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think a lot of artists want to move out of the
not-for-profit zone. I think there is a funding ceiling that can
keep artists at a certain level. It takes a lot of courage to turn
down the beneficence _ which is arduously sought _ of a kindly
Uncle Funder. Blue Man Group has created the template for artists
to be self-sufficient and self-producing, to make work the way they
want to and make a profit.''
</P>
<P>
   Carol Derfner, president of C.W. Shaver &AMP; Co., Inc., a
consulting firm for nonprofit organizations, agrees. She advises
her clients, including the Paul Taylor Dance Company, to ``start
thinking their way out of the scarcity model of economics that the
not-for-profit management system is based upon.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Entrepreneurial artists and cultural executives are figuring
out that they produce something with real value in the marketplace
and are taking more control over their destinies,'' she says.
</P>
<P>
   Before Grand Central, Streb was seen on MTV, at Coney Island and
under the Brooklyn Bridge. The company performed during a baseball
game at the Metrodome in Minneapolis. Now, she wants to follow Blue
Man, Cirque du Soleil and the new vaudevillians Penn and Teller to
what Igrejas calls the ``new frontier in entertainment'': Las
Vegas.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's my next dream,'' says Streb, who is 50 and retired from
performance. Las Vegas offers her an appealing scale: more people,
more space, more equipment. ``I am very interested in what I would
make if money were not an issue,'' she says. ``Well, what artist
wouldn't? So right now it's `Las Vegas or Bust.'''
</P>
<P>
   She now conceives of her art as a series of events in public
places, not as a repertory dance company. Public space, she adds,
is not tame territory. During the monthlong residency at Grand
Central Terminal, people wandering or hustling through the hall
gave her instant and uncensored feedback. They told her if they
didn't get it, didn't like it or couldn't believe she got paid for
doing it. The terror of receiving such uninhibited (and
instructive) commentary from complete strangers enthralls her.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wonder if it's how we look, the unitards and all?'' she
says. ``I try to analyze all of the private symbols and secrets we
employ _ choices we made way back when. They are so automatic that
we don't notice them any longer.''
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, her artistic goal remains the same: to take her
audiences on a ride, inducing their own physical experiences and
spatial confusion. To ``amaze, even shock, worry and surprise''
them, she says. But not to alienate them. So for ``Action Heroes''
she has integrated video projections and music as narrative devices
to remind the audience that the performers are real people, not
cartoon characters.
</P>
<P>
   ``People like music and need to be told a story,'' Streb says.
``Me, too. It's a welcome relief from having to experience real
work. It's the sherbet moment that cleanses the palate. So I am
using music and story to mitigate the brutality of what we do and
its eventual numbing effect on audiences.''
</P>
<P>
   The ostensible story _ more associative than narrative _ is
Streb's own story. ``This is the action whence I hail,'' she says.
``The action heroes I emulated as a kid growing up. It was at the
circus that I actually witnessed transgressive, outlawed and untidy
action in America.''
</P>
<P>
   Nick Fortunato's ``video rodeo'' brings Evel Knievel, pole
sitters, monster trucks, Harry Houdini and bull riders right into
the ring. Using a layered mix of live cameras, pure geometric forms
and prerecorded images like old newsreel footage or cloud
formations, Fortunato, a video, installation and performance
artist, evokes the spirit of action heroes past and present.
</P>
<P>
   The projections sometimes function as moving scenery, as when
drifting clouds give the swan-diving dancers an expansive sense of
flight. The images are sometimes referential, as in ``Squirm,'' a
Houdini tribute, which features a clip of the escape artist
wriggling out of a straitjacket. ``All the while I am controlling
his movements live, in time and to the music,'' Fortunato says.
``The result is something like Houdini break-dancing.''
</P>
<P>
   The music similarly ranges from the abstract to the emblematic,
including the company's aural trademark: the amplified sounds of
the performers' bodies colliding with floor and wall.

<P>
   Streb's free fall into music comes with an immediate caveat. ``I
am not actually interested in music,'' she says. ``Music is the
true enemy of dance.''
</P>
<P>
   The composer and sound designer, Miles Green, explains: ``Often
music is used to provide propulsion to dance. Elizabeth's movement
has so much thrust that the music has to be carefully constructed
to not get in the way. The score is more about mood than drive.''
He has created a palette of organic and human sounds, taking his
cue from the pioneering daredevils themselves, who ``dealt with
really basic elements: water, air, wood, breath and bone.''
</P>
<P>
   Green also uses popular songs to suggest the genealogy of
Streb's action vocabulary. A vintage 1920s recording of ``Happy
Days Are Here Again,'' for example, leads into the pole-balancing
sequence, but then the mood darkens, with composed music that
conveys the drama of the danger-seeking desperados.
</P>
<P>
   By placing the performers in historical context, Streb hopes to
defuse any questions that might distract her spectators. ``If
someone asks, `But why do you dive through the glass?' I have
failed. If the event I construct does not take over the physicality
of the person watching, then it is not an integral enough moment.
Well, perhaps now it will be clear why we do it. We are
transgressive action maniacs and have no other choice but to do the
move right now this second.''

SOME NURSES, UNHAPPY PROFESSIONALLY, TALK REVOLT 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (a and f coding)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By ANNE BARNARD  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Besieged by staffing cuts and deteriorating working conditions,
some Massachusetts nurses have decided to update their profession's
mild, nurturing image with a little more radical fire.
</P>
<P>
   They are urging the Massachusetts Nurses Association to split
off from its national parent organization, which they call too
moderate for an era when nursing is, in their words, ``in chaos and
facing extinction.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We need a revolution in health care,'' said Peggy O'Malley,
55, a nurse on disability leave from Brigham and Women's Hospital
in Boston who is campaigning for the split.
</P>
<P>
   Sounding a little less like Florence Nightingale and a bit more
like Karl Marx, leaders of the Massachusetts Nurses Association's
organized labor branch recently proposed the split from the
American Nursing Association. They were emboldened by their
successful April strike at St. Vincent Hospital in Worcester, Mass.
The strike showed nurses that they could score victories by linking
their labor issues to public concern about cost-cutting in health
care.
</P>
<P>
   The proposal has sparked a fierce debate within the
Massachusetts Nurses Association, where some call proponents of
secession ``too militant'' and suggest they are taking out their
frustration over problems that managed care has caused nurses.
</P>
<P>
   The secession movement is building as the American Nursing
Association insists that it has finally embraced a role as a
national labor union _ largely at the prompting of the
Massachusetts group. The MNA, with 18,000 members, makes up
one-tenth of the national association's numbers.
</P>
<P>
   Members of the Massachusetts group will decide the issue in a
Nov. 9 vote that will help shape the future of the organization,
which now operates both as a traditional labor union and as a
professional association for unionized nurses, nurse managers, and
educators. A two-thirds majority is needed for a split; at stake is
the $1 million in annual dues that now goes to the national
association. The Maine Nurses Association is planning a similar
vote.
</P>
<P>
   The argument goes beyond organizational infighting. Nurses are
debating how they view themselves and their profession _ and
particularly, how strongly to identify with organized labor.
</P>
<P>
   ``The image within the ANA is of the nurse as someone who
serves'' the cause of medicine, said Tom Juravich, director of the
University of Massachusetts Labor Center and author of
``Commonwealth of Toil,'' a labor history of the state. Unionized
nurses are more assertive, he said, characterizing their approach
as, ``We don't simply serve; we make our own fortunes.''
</P>
<P>
   But the national organization has changed, said Michelle Nawar,
a spokeswoman for United American Nurses, the ANA union founded
last year. While the national group was long ambivalent, she said,
nowadays even members who do not themselves support unions
recognize that the ANA should lead the way in organizing nurses.
</P>
<P>
   ``The tide is turning,'' she said. ``What we're asking is that
they wait and give the (United American Nurses) a chance.''
</P>
<P>
   Too late, said O'Malley, who is campaigning for the split.
Nurses in Massachusetts, where managed care has hit harder than in
many states, are on the ``front lines'' and ``can't afford to be
moderate,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think doctors are going to lead it, and I don't think
patients are able to lead it,'' she said. ``Nurses are leading it,
and it's nothing less than a revolution. It's a social movement.
And we've gotten much more comfortable with that as nurses.''
</P>
<P>
   Not everyone is comfortable with such unbending language, even
in the generally prolabor Massachusetts group. Meg Perry, 55, a
staff nurse at Cambridge (Mass.) Hospital, opposes the split,
saying union leaders who spend days negotiating contracts should
value compromise.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you have differences within a family, you sit down and
work it out. You don't just pack up your bags,`` Perry said.
</P>
<P>
   The national association has had its problems, including a $3
million deficit last year, but it is doing its best to address
them, Perry said. ANA membership gives Massachusetts nurses more
national clout, as well as access to a professional network, she
added. ``There's a lot to lose that people are not going to be
aware of until they reach for it and it's not there.''
</P>
<P>
   Both the Massachusetts and national groups say they want to
strengthen nurses' unions, increase access to health care, and
maintain staffing levels so that nurses don't have to work
mandatory overtime and patient safety is not compromised.
</P>
<P>
   But the ANA was slower to take those positions, prompting the
California Nurses Association to secede in 1995. The ANA adopted a
resolution against mandatory overtime only in June _ after the St.
Vincent strike in Worcester made national headlines.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps the biggest difference between the Massachusetts and
national groups centers on attitudes toward labor.
</P>
<P>
   The MNA has been unionizing nurses since the 1960s. The ANA,
trying to appeal to union and nonunion states alike, waited until
last year to create its national union. The MNA refused to join it,
arguing that its structure left it open to management influence,
which the ANA denies.
</P>
<P>
   MNA leaders who want a split complain that while 68 percent of
ANA dues come from staff nurses, 56 percent of the delegates who
set its agenda are from management or academia and are less likely
to be concerned about rank-and-file nursing issues. The ANA says it
does not keep track of the dues breakdown but points out that its
union has its own all-labor governing body and a budget of $3.5
million.
</P>
<P>
   Teachers, musicians, and actors have had similar arguments over
whether they are best represented by unions or professional groups.
But the nurses' debate resonates more strongly with the public,
Juravich said, because unions have worked hard to define the plight
of nurses in terms of larger societal issues such as access to
health care.
</P>
<P>
   That feeling was audible at a recent lunch at the 99 Restaurant,
not far from the state group's headquarters, where several members
used sweeping terms in their pitch for secession.
</P>
<P>
   ``The MNA is committed to a radical transformation of the health
care system in Massachusetts, to getting the corporations and the
insurance companies out of the picture,'' said Sandy Eaton, 56.
``The MNA is my political party.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We're organizing nurses for political action,'' said Karen
Higgins, 46, the MNA's elected chair of labor relations. She dubbed
the ANA's union ``a piece of fluff.''
</P>
<P>
   MNA president Karen Daley, who opposes the split, said the fact
that nurses' issues affect all of society means that the group
should see the value in taking a more moderate approach at times.
</P>
<P>
   ``Collective bargaining is only one tool,'' she said. But to
influence public policy, ``you also have to have access and
respect'' in places such as Washington.
</P>
<P>
   Both sides insist that nurses can think of themselves as
professionals and union members at the same time. Said Higgins:
``We're using collective bargaining as a tool to defend our
profession.''

VALENTINE'S VOTE GOES TO THE MAN HE KNOWS, NOT THE CANDIDATE 
</HEADLINE>
   By HARVEY ARATON   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   It is not as if George W. Bush needs to convince Bobby Valentine
that he can manage the country. Valentine is a registered
Republican who last voted for the other ticket, for George
McGovern, in 1972.
</P>
<P>
   No, Valentine made it clear Wednesday in his Shea Stadium office
before the Mets concluded an 8-1 homestand by edging the Reds, 2-1,
that he is a W. man, all the way to November, the 1992 dismissal in
Texas notwithstanding.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were third, two games behind Oakland, which wound up
winning the division,'' Valentine said, his this-is-between-us
smile tempting you to read between the lines. ``But there were all
these higher expectations.`
</P>
<P>
   The Rangers were 45-41 at the time, it was only July, but
Valentine was in his eighth year with a team that had never won its
division. His retrospective, seen from the high ground of a
better-paying job and another playoff race, is that ``they probably
needed to make a change, a little acceleration, even if it didn't
work.''
</P>
<P>
   At least Bush, who inherited Valentine when he became the
Rangers' managing partner in 1989, did not have some coach or
functionary stick his head into Valentine's office and suggest he
pack up, as another George with Republican party ties has been
known to do.
</P>
<P>
   ``What I always thought was different than what I expected was
that he worked within the structure,'' Valentine said of Bush. ``I
figured he would be the one to say, `OK, we have a five-game losing
streak, so we're going to wear a different color uniform today.' He
didn't. That is, he recognized that there were part-owners, a team
president, a general manager.''
</P>
<P>
   So Bush had Tom Grieve, the general manager and Valentine's good
friend, break the news, and then summoned Valentine into his
office, where the future governor said, ``If you have any
complaints, I want to hear 'em.''
</P>
<P>
   Valentine said, ``When someone gives you a closed-end statement,
what are you going to say? I think what I did say was, `I
understand what you're doing, but I don't agree.' And after that,
what I always appreciated was that we spent a lot more time talking
about family, about more important things.''
</P>
<P>
   Valentine never did learn if his firing was a Grieve idea that
Bush agreed with or a Bush idea that Grieve had no choice but to
agree with. He settled on its being a ``collective decision,''
which made him more comfortable when the hotel room telephone rang
in Pittsburgh last May at 7:30 a.m. and the candidate said, ``I've
got a meeting this morning but let's work out when I get back.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush, it turned out, was in town to make peace with John McCain
after their bitter primary campaign. The governor and the manager
hit the weights, just as they used to in the Rangers' clubhouse
before the players would come in. They had lunch, Bush seemingly
more interested in the Mets than in McCain.
</P>
<P>
   Oh, that was another thing that surprised Valentine about Bush.
He was never a sports-talk-radio caller disguised as an owner, not
the type to suggest they trade two utility infielders and his
presidential father's autograph for Don Mattingly.
</P>
<P>
   ``He actually immersed himself in the game, in the organization,
from A ball on up,'' Valentine said. ``Sometimes it would be a
little scary. He would ask if we could use some guy on another
club's bench who really could have filled the need of a
curveball-hitting pinch-hitter. I'd look at Grieve and say, `Did
you tell him that?'
</P>
<P>
   ``What I really liked about him was that he didn't control
conversations. He'd show off his intelligence most with his wit. He
listened a lot but he had a wonderful presence. When he did say
something, it was like E.F. Hutton, and he was usually outside the
status quo. If I had a five-man rotation, he would say, `Have you
thought about going with a sixth starter in the hot weather?'
</P>
<P>
   ``There were times when we were losing, not drawing and some of
the investors were worried about the return on their dollar. I just
felt he always knew how to act, that he had good judgment. He knew
the difference between right and wrong.''
</P>
<P>
   Before starting a road swing that begins Friday night in Arizona
and ends next week in Houston, Bush country, the Mets have Thursday
off. Valentine will watch the convention acceptance speech. People
ask him all the time, he said, why they should vote for Bush, but
he doesn't want to come off as some cable network partisan. He
admits to knowing ``more about the man than I do about the
candidate.'' That will be enough for him in November, though: the
memories of a man who studied baseball, a conservative who canned
him with compassion.

SOPPING WET? GOOD!
</HEADLINE>
  (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
 By JESSIE MILLIGAN 
 c.2000 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   On Tom Cruise, sweat looks good. On Rodney Dangerfield, it does
not.
</P>
<P>
   On romantic nights, sweat can be a good thing. Walking down the
aisle at a wedding, it's bad.
</P>
<P>
   In this, the sopping season, it's hard not to be aware of the
good sides, the bad sides, the wet sides of sweat, indelicate as it
may be.
</P>
<P>
   An adult, in cool weather, will lose 1 to 3 pints of sweat a
day, and even more when the temperature rises. Under the most
extreme conditions, a person can lose 5 gallons a day.
</P>
<P>
   Mostly, we don't see it. Sweat cools us by evaporating, so often
it disappears before we even know it's there. For this, we are
thankful.
</P>
<P>
   When the temperature climbs, when we are very nervous or
excited, and especially when the air is humid, sweat doesn't
evaporate. It ceases to cool us. We are stuck with it _ and sticky
with it.
</P>
<P>
   We might as well accept it. Sweat has its good side.
</P>
<P>
   ``We can't survive without sweating,'' says Steve Brotherton, a
Fort Worth sports medicine physician.
</P>
<P>
   If we didn't sweat, we'd have to pant like dogs to cool
ourselves down. Given that option, sweat looks good.
</P>
<P>
   It's the absence of sweating that is truly bad. If we sweat and
then stop sweating, we may be suffering from dehydration or
heatstroke. We would overheat and our organs eventually would quit
functioning, doctors say.
</P>
<P>
   Still, sweat is not widely popular. Most of us avoid it or
disguise it.
</P>
<P>
   For some of us, sweat is so excessive that it ruins lives. This
is also the bad side of sweat.
</P>
<P>
   Jim Garza, a surgeon who operates the Hyperhidrosis Clinic USA
in Houston, says there's a stigma against heavy sweating, called
hyperhidrosis in medical circles. People see sweat and they think
the person who is sweating is nervous or anxious or lying or sick
or way too worked up.
</P>
<P>
   ``People think heavy sweating is an emotional or psychological
condition, when really it is a physiological condition that is
genetic, and the person cannot help it,'' Garza says.
</P>
<P>
   Hyperhidrosis Clinic USA treats hypersweating, and it lists
client testimonials on its Web site. They include an FBI
interrogator who doesn't want suspects to see him sweat. A mechanic
whose tools got rusty. Teens who wouldn't date. A computer
specialist who ruined keyboards. A man who called off his wedding
because he didn't want guests to think he was nervous or sick.
</P>
<P>
   They all opted for surgery.
</P>
<P>
   The clinic treats excessive sweating through an outpatient
surgical procedure in which the surgeon makes a small incision near
the armpit and clamps the ``sweat nerve'' to stop transmissions.
The procedure works best for heavy hand sweating, as well as
sweating from the face, scalp and underarms, and it also controls
excessive blushing. The procedure is known as ETS (endoscopic
transthoracic sympathicotomy).
</P>
<P>
   The most common side effect, according to www.webmd.com, is
known as compensatory sweating: Patients develop sweat over their
lower legs, thighs, back or abdomen after the surgery.
</P>
<P>
   Only 1 percent of the population suffers from career- or
relationship-ruining sweat, Garza says. The rest of us glow,
perspire, wilt, exude, swelter.
</P>
<P>
   We sweat. And that's not so bad.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   NEED TO REHYDRATE? NO SWEAT &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Doctors say sweat is mostly water, with trace amounts of salt
and potassium and even tinier amounts of lactic and uric acids.
</P>
<P>
   Drink mostly water to replace water lost through sweat. How
much? Depends on who you are.
</P>
<P>
   Regular Joes: Eight cups a day is standard for adults who aren't
visibly sweating. Drink more if you are sweating.
</P>
<P>
   Serious athletes and people who are pushing cattle for eight
hours: These uber-men and women may want to replace the lost sodium
and potassium with sports drinks, but most of us rarely need to,
said Brotherton and pediatrician Walter Halpenny, also of Fort
Worth. The doctors say drink at least eight glasses of water if you
are working hard in the sun. It wouldn't hurt to toss down a sports
drink, as well.
</P>
<P>
   What about salt pills? The doctors say the old-fashioned idea of
taking salt pills in the summer is best avoided. Although sweat
tastes salty, there's very little salt in it. Most of us get too
much salt in our diet. Pass the peanuts, please. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   DON'T SWEAT THIS HOT RUMOR &QL;
</P>
<P>
   An e-mail hoax about sweat, antiperspirant and breast cancer has
been circulating for several years now. This month, Nancy
Snyderman, a physician who appears regularly on Oprah's show and
who writes a column on www.drkoop.com, nixed the rumor.
</P>
<P>
   ``Essentially, the hoax contends that antiperspirants stop the
body from purging itself of toxins via underarm perspiration. It
goes on to allege that the toxins collect in the underarm and
breast area and cause cells to mutate into cancer,'' Snyderman
writes. It's not true, she says. Sweat serves to regulate body
temperature and has very little to do with purging toxins. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   QUICK CURES FOR EXCESSIVE SWEAT &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Headed to a job interview? Scared for anyone to shake your
slippery hand? A 30-minute soak in cool water will shrink pores
enough to provide about three hours of wetness protection, says
Selma Targovnik, a dermatologist, in ``Symptoms, Their Causes &AMP;
Cures'' (Bantam Books, 1996).
</P>
<P>
   Dermatology Professor R. Kenneth Landow, also quoted in
``Symptoms,'' says rubbing alcohol will constrict the pores and
hold back sweating for several hours, although if done too often it
can cause severe skin drying and irritation.
</P>
<P>
   Landow also says that alcohol (the kind you drink) and tobacco
are sweat-inducing. Alcohol tends to dilate blood vessels in the
skin, increasing body heat, and tobacco increases your adrenaline
levels, both conditions that increase sweat, he says. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   VIRTUAL TOWELETTE, ANYONE? &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Maybe one of the most truly odd Web sites around is the Moist
Towelette Online Museum, posted by a fellow named Jeff French in
November 1998. It features photographs of packages of towelettes,
those pre-moistened paper towels that come in small pouches. Their
uses are many, but they are handy things to have in the car to mop
a sweaty brow. French has scanned in the packages and posted them
on the Web. Why? Why ask? The Microsoft Network listed it as a
featured site of the day in June. The Moist Towelette Online Museum
registered 13,700 hits that day from around the world, in addition
to the 4,000 visits the site has had otherwise. The site address:

<P>
   SWEAT SCIENCE &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The greatest concentration of sweat glands is in our feet. The
least are in our back. Even our ear canals sweat. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   SWEET SWEAT &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Several American Indian tribes believe that sweat leads to moral
purification and physical healing. Group sweats inside small lodges
are held as bonding and cleansing experiences, and are considered
part of spiritual practice.
</P>
<P>
   Modern-day spas use wraps and layers of blankets to make clients
sweat as a way to cleanse skin. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   GONNA MAKE YOU SWEAT &QL;
</P>
<P>
   It has been said we should sweat every day if we want to get
fit.
</P>
<P>
   Brotherton doesn't agree.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not a good measurement,'' he says. Sweat can evaporate as
fast as we make it.
</P>
<P>
   ``The goals for exercise should be to get the heart rate up to
the proper level and following a regimen,'' Brotherton says.
</P>
<P>
   To function well during exercise, drink water before you start,
he says. Your body needs it to perform well, especially in the
heat. Don't wait until you get thirsty. &QL;

BAY STATE TO GET STRICT GENETIC PRIVACY LAW 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By RAJA MISHRA  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ Massachusetts lawmakers are expected to pass a sweeping
genetic privacy bill that would create strict prohibitions against
genetic discrimination in banking, housing, health insurance and
employment and give patients almost total control over genetic test
results.
</P>
<P>
   The bill had been languishing on Beacon Hill for much of the
year until legislators, apparently spurred by the July announcement
that scientists had deciphered much of the human genetic code,
engaged in furious negotiations over the last two weeks.
</P>
<P>
   The House passed the measure, considered by many to be among the
strongest in the nation, on Monday night, and the Senate is
expected to pass it unanimously Thursday. Several agencies in Gov.
Paul Cellucci's adminstration have given the bill a positive review
but Cellucci was at the GOP Convention in Philadelphia Wednesday
and unavailable for comment.
</P>
<P>
   Genetic testing may one day be able to predict diseases and even
aspects of personality, such as temper and intelligence. Already,
tests can identify people who have a higher chance of suffering
from certain cancers and a handful of other maladies. The
increasing prevelance of these tests have prompted worries that
they could be used to discriminate against people who might be seen
as costly medical risks, potentially disruptive or simply
undesirable for whatever reason.
</P>
<P>
   Its centerpiece is a broad prohibition against genetic
discrimination in obtaining loans, purchasing housing, purchasing
health insurance and applying for jobs.
</P>
<P>
   The bill would also require written consent from a patient
before the results of a genetic test could be given out to anyone
but attending physicians. This is considered the highest standard
of privacy protection.
</P>
<P>
   The bill is modeled after civil rights statutes that ban
discrimination on the basis of race, and indeed many of the bill's
most vocal backers were traditional civil rights groups who
consider the human genome a 21st century addition to their turf.
</P>
<P>
   ``The catalyst for this was quite frankly was the Human Genome
Project,'' said Senate Majority Leader Linda J. Melconian
(D-Springfield). ``It became pretty clear this was serious
business, that it was 21st century technology that needed consumer
protections.''
</P>
<P>
   The privacy legislation was jump-started after scientists in
Washington announced in July they had virtually completed
identifying the long string of molecules that directs the
development and functioning of the human body.
</P>
<P>
   Reseachers are now turning to the daunting task of sifting
through this genetic clutter for the individual genes that regulate
almost every aspect of human life. Hundreds of genes have been
identified already but there are estimated to be between 50,000 and
100,000 of them.
</P>
<P>
   As researchers identify more genes and discover how they work,
genetic testing will be able to tell doctors more and more about a
patient's life prospects.
</P>
<P>
   After the genome announcement, privacy advocates circulated a
letter urging action on the genetic privacy bill then sitting idly
in a House committee. They were worried the bill would be forgotten
in the hub-bub of the negotiations over a new Red Sox ballpark. To
their surprise, almost 100 legislators signed the letter and the
bill had new life.
</P>
<P>
   Life insurance companies, which use health testing to calculate
the risk of covering people, resisted the legislation, arguing that
the bill would deprive them of an important business tool.
</P>
<P>
   To an extent, their concerns were heeded: the bill does not, as
many privacy advocates wished, permit people to block life insurers
from accessing genetic test results. Instead it establishes a
commission to study the issue for two years and report back to
Beacon Hill.

TRADITION AND EXPERIMENTATION IN AMERICA'S ONE-ROOM SCHOOLHOUSES 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Mont., Neb., Calif., P a .)  (For release Sunday, Aug. 6.)

<P>
   BLOOMFIELD, Mont. _ School doesn't start until the Mullets
arrive. Today, they are late, so we wait.
</P>
<P>
   Kenny Whitmer, 6, is going round and round on the rickety
pentagon a local welder built out of $46 worth of pipes half a
century ago. Julia Lindquist, a seventh-grade loner, is sitting by
herself, contemplating the gaping sky and the wind pushing waves
through the grassy field. The boys are shooting hoops, as usual.
They let Monica Hostetler, 14, play, to even out the teams _ first
when there are only three of them, then again when there are five.
In between, she hangs at the other end of the makeshift court,
lobbing jumpers into the net.
</P>
<P>
   It's 10, 12, maybe 15 minutes past 8 a.m. when the forest-green
1998 Oldsmobile Regency pulls into the dirt driveway and the
Mullets tumble out: Marshall, the eighth-grader; Winston, a year
younger; Merrilee, who is 11; and Sterling, age 9. They live the
farthest from the white clapboard schoolhouse, 11 miles down gravel
roads across the empty plains, so their lateness might be
forgivable, except that it holds everybody else up.
</P>
<P>
   As the Mullets pull backpacks, musical instruments and lunch
boxes from the trunk, the boys on the blacktop hurry to land one
more basket. Linda Borntrager, the teacher, is standing on the
schoolhouse steps, one hand on the hip of her faded jeans, the
other clasping the old cowbell, ready to ring. It's time to raise
the flag, say the Pledge of Allegiance, start another day at
Bloomfield School.
</P>
<P>
   ``If they're absent, we really have declined enrollment for the
day,'' Borntrager, 48, said about the Mullets, laughing. The family
accounts for four of her 13 students, and two more are Mullet
cousins. Children at Bloomfield ``just have to learn how to be
flexible,'' she added. ``That's a good skill in life.''
</P>
<P>
   Bloomfield School, which opened in 1908, is one of nearly 400
remaining public one-room schoolhouses in the nation, at once a
nostalgic remnant of the past and a modern outlet for educational
experimentation.
</P>
<P>
   Even as the number of tiny rural schools has plunged in recent
years, the fundamental aspects of teaching and learning inside them
_ including multi-age classrooms, peer tutoring, interdisciplinary
projects and keeping students with the same teacher for more than
one year _ are being copied in large school systems across the
country. Small classes and, especially, small schools are
increasingly seen as crucial to students' success in the early
grades, leading many urban educators to create islands within large
school buildings that attempt to foster the intimacy and individual
attention of schools like Bloomfield.
</P>
<P>
   And, with the Internet, long-held concerns about the narrow
curriculum available in an isolated one-teacher school are fading.
</P>
<P>
   ``One-room schools really represent, I think, the best model for
training American children for the first through the eighth
grades,'' said Andrew Gulliford, director of the Center for
Southwest Studies at Fort Lewis College in Durango, Colo., who is
the nation's leading expert on one-room schools.
</P>
<P>
   ``In terms of ego development, in terms of character, in terms
of personality, in terms of the well-rounded individual fitting in
with the group, country schools are very efficient _ they helped
train generations of Americans,'' added Gulliford, author of the
definitive book on the subject, ``America's Country Schools''
(University of Colorado Press). ``In a one-room schoolhouse, every
child counts _ they've always counted, whether it was 1890 or 1990.
How can you say that in most modern educational systems today? It's
just not true.''
</P>
<P>
   It is 10:50 a.m. on a Tuesday, a couple of hours after I've
arrived here amid the cattle ranches and wheat farms, and
Borntrager is deep into an eighth-grade math lesson on symmetry,
using a mirror and a book of drawings to show how even complex
shapes can sometimes be divided exactly in half.
</P>
<P>
   Kenny &UR;  &LR; Whitmer, meanwhile, is hunched over a first-grade reader.
Sterling Mullet, the third-grader, is copying contractions into his
notebook. Brady Boese, 12, and Matthew Kanagy, 14, are suffering
through a quiz on probability and percentages, while Brady's twin
brother, Kirk, is pondering a work sheet titled ``Remembering
Details,'' based on the novel ``Where the Red Fern Grows.''
</P>
<P>
   Julia Lindquist, a seventh-grader, has her nose stuck in ``The
Call of the Wild,'' legs outstretched, ankles crossed, and Winston
Mullet, 13, is methodically computing fractions and decimals.
Daniel Whitmer, six years older than Kenny, is tackling problems
from a math text, and Keith Hall, 13, is drawing conclusions _ at
least according to the paper on his desk _ from ``Red Fern.''
Clayton Unruh has his seventh-grade spelling workbook open to a
crossword puzzle. MerrileeMullet, the fifth-grader, is in the back
of the room, using the computer to type sentences she made up from
a list of new vocabulary words.
</P>
<P>
   It could be educational chaos, but all is quiet except for the
ceiling fans spinning overhead and the teacher's low-voiced prompts
to the two students at her half-moon table in the corner. Most of
the children have pencils moving, pages turning. Julia, Keith and
Daniel occasionally stare blankly out the large windows at the
endless brown earth. And every so often, one of the boys pops up
from his desk, carrying a book or a paper over to Mrs. B. with a
question.
</P>
<P>
   Eyes searching behind his wire-rim glasses, Brady wants to know
which number should be the numerator as he forms an algebraic
equation to answer the question: 18 is 30 percent of what number?
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a quiz, Brady, so you're going to have to figure it out
on your own,'' the ruddy-cheeked teacher tells the tow-headed twin.
``One thing is to try both and then use your sense.''
</P>
<P>
   (MORE) &QL; 
nn
</P>
<P>
   By 11, it's time for a different math ``class'' _ Julia and
Keith, seventh-graders who lag behind, and Merrilee, a fifth-grader
a bit advanced for her age, stand at the chalkboard adding and
subtracting fractions. Four different reading groups have already
cycled through Mrs. B.'s station this morning. At 11:15, the
children race outside for calisthenics, led by Kenny, as much the
school's mascot as one of its students. They fold their legs into a
pretzel stretch, then run around the edge of the wheat field that
lies beyond the school's large yard in a haphazard training regimen
for the coming track meet with nearby one-room schools. Today, the
twins will have to wait until after lunch for math.
</P>
<P>
   ``We just do kind of a rotation,'' Borntrager said with a shrug.
``I think my goal is to try to make sure everybody's doing
constructive work almost all the time.''
</P>
<P>
   Borntrager, who is paid $26,000 a year _ twice what she made
when she started at Bloomfield 17 years ago _ often has as many as
25 different lessons to prepare each day. During the 1999-2000
school year, her 13 students were in six grades, but she sometimes
subdivides the older students according to ability or interest.
``The Red Badge of Courage'' and ``The Call of the Wild'' are
novels of similar difficulty, for example, and Borntrager taught
them at the same time so the reading groups would have only three
or four students (and to appease animal lovers uninterested in gory
wars).
</P>
<P>
   At Bloomfield, students spend most of the day working by
themselves at their desks, old-fashioned wood-topped tables with
attached chairs arranged in rows. Borntrager relies heavily on
textbooks and work sheets she has collected over the years; she
rarely lectures to the group, instead running mini-classes in her
corner, most lasting no more than 10 minutes. A teacher's aide
often helps the younger boys with reading or art projects in a
separate corner, or stands by an individual student's desk,
administering a vocabulary test in the most nonthreatening way.
</P>
<P>
   ``The kids who come out of Bloomfield have real good study
stills,'' said Cindi Hostetler, Monica's mother, who teaches music
and serves as a part-time aide at the school, earning the minimum
wage. ``They know how to go back to their desks and go to work.''
</P>
<P>
   Borntrager does not assign homework, but students who fall
behind must finish their work after school. At the high school in
Richey, about 20 miles away, Bloomfield graduates often rise to the
top of their classes. Last spring, alumni of the school won the top
awards for freshmen, sophomores and juniors at the Eastern Montana
Math Meet.
</P>
<P>
   Statewide, students from elementary schools with fewer than 40
students tend to outperform their peers on standardized tests in
every subject. During the 1997-98 school year, in the fourth and
eighth grades, more students from Montana's small schools were
rated ``advanced'' or ``proficient'' _ and fewer were ``novice'' or
``near proficiency'' _ than their counterparts in the subjects of
reading, math, language arts, science and social studies.
</P>
<P>
   ``What you're showing there is small class-size ratio and
individual teacher contact with kids,'' said Lance Melton,
executive director of the Montana School Boards Association.
</P>
<P>
   One of the advantages parents and educators see in one-room
schools is the natural tailoring of the curriculum to children's
needs.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nobody gets left through the cracks,'' said Mrs. Hostetler,
whose husband and two older children also graduated from
Bloomfield. ``If you're a smart kid, they take you where you can
go. If you're struggling, you get the individual attention.''
</P>
<P>
   That is what brought Keith Hall to Bloomfield last spring.
</P>
<P>
   Growing up in the Portland, Ore., suburbs, Keith bounced among
nine different schools, including one with 3,000 students. He was
learning very little, but getting into plenty of trouble. ``They
were just shoving him through,'' said Phyllis Mullet, his
grandmother and guardian.
</P>
<P>
   Keith spent the summer of 1999 on Mrs. Mullet's farm here,
hunting, fishing and tooling around on a four-wheeler. After
another year of fighting at home and at school, he returned to
Bloomfield School two weeks before school let out in May, raising
the school's enrollment by 8 percent.
</P>
<P>
   He reads at about a third-grade level and misspells even basic
words like ``reason'' (reazer), ``other'' (outer) and ``touch''
(tuch). But Keith, one of two Bloomfield students who take Ritalin,
is a sweet boy who stays after school to help Mrs. B. move
furniture, a smart kid who is energized by tactile science projects
like identifying bone fragments from owl pellets and building
rockets out of soda bottles.
</P>
<P>
   ``The other schools were junk,'' said Keith, whose dark-brown
buzz cut is a remnant of his city brashness. ``This one, it's
different.
</P>
<P>
   ``At my old school, it would take them half the year just to
know you. There was, like, 32 kids in my class, so it was kind of
hard to ask the teachers questions,'' he added. ``Here, they keep
track and stuff. They tell you, `Do you have this reading or this
done?' There, they never tell you.''

 &HT;    After delays, 2 prized wide receiver recruits set to join
Bulldogs
 &HT;    By Mark Schlabach
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATHENS, Ga. - Georgia football coach Jim Donnan finally gets to
remove the shrink wrap from two of his most prized recruits this
week.
</P>
<P>
   Reggie Brown and Durrell Robinson both signed with the Bulldogs
in 1999, but had to sit out last season after they failed to
qualify academically.
</P>
<P>
   ``Both of those guys will really help our team,'' Donnan said.
``They're unproven, and they've still got to do it on the field,
but I think they'll give us a very talented receiver corps this
season.''
</P>
<P>
   Brown, a Parade All-American and the Journal-Constitution's
state player of the year in 1998, did not enroll at Georgia until
January. Brown was ruled ineligible after he failed to pass an
English class at Carrollton High School.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was hard, but I didn't dwell on it for too long,'' he said.
``It's over now, so I'm just trying to go on with my life.''
</P>
<P>
   After Brown enrolled, he wasn't allowed to practice this spring.
He took part in voluntary summer passing drills and gets his first
official workout on Friday with 13 other freshmen.
</P>
<P>
   ``This summer has helped me a lot,'' Brown said. ``I wasn't able
to do much during the six months between high school and coming
here. My hands and passing routes were a little bit rusty.''
</P>
<P>
   Brown, 6 feet 2, 185 pounds, might be Georgia's fastest
receiver. He has been timed at 4.38 seconds in the 40-yard dash and
held the state long-jump record of 24-9, broken this year. Donnan
has called Brown a ``gazelle, a pure athlete who can fly.''
</P>
<P>
   Robinson, 6 feet 2, 207 pounds, isn't as fast as Brown (4.51
seconds in the 40), but Robinson has more upper-body strength and
experience. He was a partial qualifier last season and practiced
with the team, but under NCAA rules he wasn't allowed to play in
games.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was frustrating,'' Robinson said. ``I wanted to be out
there helping my teammates win games. But I think I still got
better as a player and person last year.''
</P>
<P>
   Georgia's receivers struggled last season. Without much speed at
receiver, defenses loaded the line to stop the running game.
Terrence Edwards, the first Georgia freshman since 1978 to lead the
team in receiving, often saw double-coverage.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hopefully, the addition of a couple of speed guys on the
perimeter will help our big-play potential and also our running
game,'' Donnan said.
</P>
<P>
   Quarterback Quincy Carter says he's looking forward to finally
seeing his new receivers, which include redshirt freshmen Damien
Gary of Athens and Michael Johnson of Tulsa, Okla.
</P>
<P>
   ``Durrell's going to have an advantage over Reggie because he's
been in full pads for almost a year,'' Carter said. ``He's gone
through two-a-days and spring practice. But I don't think it's
going to take Reggie long to catch up.''

 BLOOMFIELD: tell you.' ' 
<TEXT>

   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   In 1917, there were 196,000 one-teacher public schools in the
United States. At last count, in 1996, there were 380.
</P>
<P>
   Spread throughout 32 states, one-room schools are concentrated
in Nebraska, which has 128, and Montana, with 81. But while schools
throughout the rural Midwest and Mountain States have been
consolidating, California has seen a 22 percent growth in the
number of one-room schools in the last five years, fueled in part
by flexible work schedules and telecommuting policies that allow
families to pursue frontier living again. At the same time, Amish
and Mennonite communities, among others, have been opening private
one-room schools, which total nearly 1,200; about a third are in
Pennsylvania.
</P>
<P>
   Among the public schools, average enrollment in 1996 was 9.4
students, according to a study by researchers at Brigham Young
University in Provo, Utah. The teachers typically had more than 10
years of experience, with three to five years in their present
classrooms, the study showed, and about a third of them lived in a
room or trailer attached to the school.
</P>
<P>
   Here in Dawson County, a 2,358-square-mile expanse of empty
plains and badlands that was once called the gateway to Montana,
there were 138 rural schools in 1919, according to a fading book
chronicling their history. A ledger kept by the county
superintendent shows that in 1955, the county had 47 teachers. That
dwindled to 32 over the next decade, then to 21 in 1969. When
Borntrager arrived at Bloomfield School in 1983, she was one of
nine teachers in the county; today there are three.
</P>
<P>
   The attrition is mostly about economics, as fewer and fewer
families find that they can survive farming the arid land. There
are now 53 stops on the 44-mile postal route around Bloomfield;
once, there were two routes, with 80 families each.
</P>
<P>
   But Bloomfield, a one-gas-station outpost 247 miles from the
Billings airport _ and 27 miles from the nearest McDonald's _ is
also losing students to home schooling, which is increasingly
popular among the area's religious Mennonites, and to the schools
in Richey, the nearest town, where students can play on basketball
and volleyball teams. In the fall, the Boese twins and Clayton
Unruh plan to enroll at Richey, leaving Borntrager with just eight
students. The next kindergartner on the horizon is Elizabeth
Nissley, who will not enroll until the fall of 2001.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's probably why I'll stop teaching,'' Borntrager said with
a sigh one afternoon during the eight-mile drive from school to her
modest house, a double-wide trailer with an addition her husband
built. ``We're going to run out of kids.''
</P>
<P>
   Once, Bloomfield School was packed with 40 students, and voters
approved a special tax to create a second classroom. Now the two
rooms are combined into a 35-by-60-foot space, filled not with
children but with an upright piano, project tables for art and
audio, and three computers, with a library of 4,000 worn paperbacks
around the perimeter. In the basement, there is enough open space
to hold gym class indoors.
</P>
<P>
   The first Bloomfield School burned in 1918. Another fire felled
the new one a decade later. The third and current building got
electricity in 1948 (after years of running a wire from a 32-volt
battery at the store down the road) and indoor plumbing in 1950,
although the outhouse, with separate wood-lidded toilets for boys
and girls, still stands out back.
</P>
<P>
   ``This, to me, doesn't look like a school,'' said Jeff Whitmer,
77, Kenny and Daniel's grandfather and the unofficial historian of
Bloomfield School, from which he graduated in 1936. ``This, to me,
is just like a big living room.''
</P>
<P>
   Whitmer built the merry-go-round in 1954 or 1955, after the
ladies of Bloomfield discovered that $46 would not buy them much
playground equipment. He rode on the giant stride, a kind of swing
made of a metal pole with link chains hanging off the top, when it
was built in the 1930s. Back then they rode horses to school, or
sleds in winter. It would take a while for the coal furnace to warm
up, so the water bucket in the hallway would be frozen solid each
morning. There were no janitors; the children cleaned the classroom
themselves.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our classroom had four rows of desks and a big bench at the
front for the teacher,'' Whitmer said. ``The teacher would holler
out, `Fourth-grade arithmetic!' and you'd march on down. You were
told to shut up about twice, and then you were hit upside the head,
or hit with a book.''
</P>
<P>
   Today's discipline is somewhat softer. Occasionally Borntrager
will look up from her corner and say, ``Quiet, please, guys,'' or,
``People, there's too much talking in here,'' but there are not a
lot of rules in her classroom.
</P>
<P>
   Borntrager, who was born in Hebron, N.D., rode a horse four
miles each way to Farmer's Valley, a one-room schoolhouse, through
fifth grade. After attending the state university in Fargo, N.D.,
she worked as a waitress, then for the telephone company in Denver
and in Arizona. After divorcing her first husband, she returned
home to get a degree in elementary education. When she fell in love
with a farmer-rancher from these parts, the teacher's desk at
Bloomfield was vacant.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know if I'd like teaching in a big classroom, with all
the other things that go with it,'' said Borntrager, whose three
children are among the 28 students who have graduated from the
school since she arrived. ``The teachers' lounge. The rigidity as
far as the classroom timing.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm probably like the kids in a sense,'' she added. ``I like
the ability to have that freedom.''
</P>
<P>
   Living in a community where the drivers of every passing car
acknowledge each other with a half-wave, Borntrager is surrounded
by her successes _ and cannot walk away from students who are
struggling. Looking out at her classroom today, she can see the
kindergartners the seventh-grade boys used to be, remembers when
Clayton Unruh announced that he could not read ``Red Fern'' because
it was too long, and how it turned out to be his favorite book.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't have to spend two weeks in the fall figuring out where
these kids are, and I can be, in the back of my mind, planning
during the summer,'' she said. ``We don't have to spend any time
getting to know each other in the fall. We can get right on to
it.''
</P>
<P>
   Kenny, his blond bangs almost hiding his ice-blue eyes, is
paired with Monica, whose metal-filled mouth and experiments with
eyeliner betray her entry into adolescence.
</P>
<P>
   ``What color do you want?'' the eighth-grader asks her protege
as they begin to plan their bottle rocket for the end-of-the-year
launch.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can pick this time,'' Kenny says generously, then suggests
that each name a favorite color to combine in the decorations.
</P>
<P>
   Kenny picks yellow. Monica picks orange.
</P>
<P>
   ``Yellow and orange?'' Kenny squeals. ``Those are my favorite
colors!''
</P>
<P>
   Monica gets the construction paper. Kenny names the project the
Rocketeer. She draws the lines, he tries the scissors.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're going to make it actually shoot up in the air,'' she
tells him confidently, then adds, ``I don't know exactly how.''
</P>
<P>
   Kenny concentrates, chews a lip.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can't cut straight,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a good thing I didn't draw straight, huh?'' she responds.
</P>
<P>
   ``How'd you know I couldn't cut straight?'' Kenny asks.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't know,'' Monica says. ``That's good. That's what gives
it character.''
</P>
<P>
   The rocket project is a classic one-room schoolhouse lesson. For
Kenny, it is good practice with shapes. For Sterling, the
third-grader, it is real-life application of the concepts of
aerodynamics, thrust and liftoff in his science text. The older
students have researched the space shuttle on the Internet. There
will be practice with fractions as the students decide how much
water to put in the bottles. And, it's all about teamwork.
</P>
<P>
   The challenge of teaching at Bloomfield School is finding things
that are interesting to a boy of 6 and a girl of 14 _ and everyone
in between. There are few options for parts in the Christmas
pageant, which is a tradition here. But the peer tutoring, like
pairing Monica and Kenny, often creates the most magical moments of
learning. And while it can be lonely to be the only girl of a given
age, the small, multi-age setting limits peer pressure; children
have little choice but to get along.
</P>
<P>
   Before moving to Bloomfield, ``I got picked on a lot,'' said
Julia, whose skull was malformed at birth and has required several
surgeries, leaving a prominent scar on the top of her head.
</P>
<P>
   Julia, 13, draws beautiful pictures of horses and is writing her
11th book in a series about mining, but, ``for some reason, I kind
of get along better with younger kids,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I like watching cartoons and playing with toys. Merrilee and
Sterling and Kenny and I can really have conversations,'' she
added. ``Probably when I get into high school, I'll stay by myself
a lot.''
</P>
<P>
   In gym, Cori Schultz, the teacher's aide, tries to separate
brothers and create games where the first-grader won't just get
mowed over by the eighth-graders. Instead of traditional kickball,
they put a garbage can at home plate, and kickers score points
according to what base they reach before the fielders land the ball
in the bucket (I had to play to even out the teams, and triumphed
with a home run).
</P>
<P>
   After two days of designing and building the bottle rockets,
with their ever more elaborate noses and fins, it was time for the
launch. We placed the homemade launcher around second base, and
lined up. The eldest Mullet sat atop the swing set with a video
camera, Matthew Kanagy stood ready to release the bottles, and
Keith primed the pump. The rest of the students scattered to see
which rocket would fly highest and farthest, which would twirl and
spin, and which would fall flat.
</P>
<P>
   Keith's masterpiece, its two-foot cardboard cylinder festooned
with a picture of President Clinton, floundered; too heavy. The
Mountain Dewzy, by Winston and Matthew, performed a spectacular
loop-the-loop before sputtering out. Monica and Kenny's Rocketeer
looked pretty but had an unremarkable ride. The cleanest, strongest
rocket was the unlikely, simple design by Julia and Sterling, who
filled their bottle half full and used the maximum amount of air.
</P>
<P>
   Daniel's was the biggest disappointment. Its small orange wings
and white cone head could not stand up to the stiff wind. He
planned to fill the bottle five-eighths full of water, but some
spilled out. And Daniel only used four pumps _ in retrospect,
clearly not enough.
</P>
<P>
   He moped around the field alone awhile, ignoring the other
rockets as they flew overhead. If only he could try again. He would
use maximum air, less water. Design a stiff cardboard cone to cut
through the wind. Waste less time on the useless paper fins. And,
definitely, not go first, before the kinks are worked out of the
launching system.
</P>
<P>
   ``Did you say we're doing this again next year?'' Daniel asked
the teacher, hopefully.
</P>
<P>
   ``You want to do it next year?'' Borntrager replied. Well, why
not?

JUDGE RULES AGAINST LADY BIRD JOHNSON WILDFLOWER CENTER 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By BILL MURPHY 
c.2000 Houston Chronicle 
 
  
<TEXT>
<P>
   HOUSTON _ A Harris County probate judge ruled Wednesday that the
Lady Bird Johnson Wildflower Center cannot collect a $500,000
pledge made by late Houston socialite Faith Bybee.
</P>
<P>
   Judge Rory Olsen granted summary judgment in favor of the
executor of Bybee's estate, Chase Bank of Texas, which has refused
to honor the pledge.
</P>
<P>
   The center, located in Austin, sued Chase, saying Bybee's pledge
in 1990, when she was 90, created a contract that the estate should
be required to honor. Chase Bank's position was that this pledge,
like many other pledges to charities, didn't create a contract and,
moreover, that Bybee notified the center she didn't have the money
to honor it long before she died.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a gratifying decision because the lawsuit was one that
never should have been brought,'' said Chase's lawyer, Bill Ogden.
``Part of what makes the case so sad is that most charitable
organizations have more civility than that, more compassion than
that.''
</P>
<P>
   Mark Mayfield, lawyer for the center, said, ``It's unfortunate
that Mr. Ogden wants to try this case in the media. It was Chase
Bank that acted inappropriately in denying a valid claim'' by the
center.
</P>
<P>
   Bybee, Mayfield said, ``had every intention of honoring her
pledge.''
</P>
<P>
   Olsen didn't provide a written explanation of his ruling. He had
asked lawyers on both sides for additional briefs addressing issues
related to statute of limitations.
</P>
<P>
   Ogden argued the center had four years from the time Bybee made
the pledge, or until 1994, to bring a breach-of-contract suit.
</P>
<P>
   Mayfield argued the center filed the suit within the four-year
time frame because he said the statute of limitations didn't begin
ticking until Bybee died in 1996.
</P>
<P>
   The suit pitted the center started by Johnson against the estate
of her friend. The center, named in honor of the former first lady,
works to preserve native flowering plants on public lands.
</P>
<P>
   Once it became clear the center was gearing up for a suit, a
nephew of Bybee wrote to Johnson and tried to explain matters to
her, Ogden said.
</P>
<P>
   Johnson wrote back that she didn't want `` `to pursue the matter
of Faith's pledge to the center in any manner that will cause
public embarrassment to anyone or tarnish the reputation of Mrs.
Bybee. I personally want to see this resolved quickly and without
anyone going to court,' '' according to Ogden's pleadings.
</P>
<P>
   Mayfield said, ``Mr. Ogden is quite fond of quoting that letter
out of context.'' The lawyer said that when the letter is read in
its entirety, Johnson makes clear she and the center's board
members have a responsibility to seek money the center believes it
is owed.
</P>
<P>
   Ogden said the Houston Museum of Fine Arts and McNay Museum in
San Antonio didn't sue the estate for pledges made by Bybee.
</P>
<P>
   Bybee's ``reach clearly exceeded her grasp at times,'' Ogden
said.
</P>
<P>
   In a prepared statement released before Olsen made his ruling,
center director Robert Breunig said, ``The Wildflower Center has
attempted to resolve this matter without resorting to the courts.''
</P>
<P>
   Bybee died with an estate worth $997,000.
</P>
<P>
   But Ogden says that on paper, Bybee may have appeared to have
$997,000, but she was actually in debt. When her late husband died
before her, he set up his estate in such a way that his wife could
draw money from it, Ogden said. This arrangement was done to
achieve tax savings.
</P>
<P>
   But what it meant is that she owed his estate $1.5 million when
she died, Ogden says. Chase has said it will pay this debt, and the
$1.5 million in her husband's estate would then go to the Bybee
Foundation, slated by both his and his wife's wills to be their
primary beneficiaries, Ogden said.
</P>
<P>
   The Bybee Foundation is dedicated to the preservation of Texas
pioneer arts and history. Faith Bybee was an authority on Texas
history and antiques.
</P>
<P>
   The center has argued Chase was wrong to give everything to the
foundation when it could have honored all or part of Bybee's pledge
to it.
</P>
<P>
   Mayfield said he is unsure whether the center will appeal. &QL;

FORD RECOVERING FROM TWO MINOR STROKES 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By RAJA MISHRA AND JILL ZUCKMAN  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHILADELPHIA _ Former President Gerald Ford was comfortably
recuperating in a hospital after apparently suffering two minor
strokes, casting a slight pall over what has been an otherwise
cheery Republican convention.
</P>
<P>
   His primary caretaker, Dr. Robert Schwartzman, chief of
neurology at Hahnemann University Hospital, said Wednesday that the
87-year-old Ford was ``much better than he was this morning,'' and
``should totally recover.''
</P>
<P>
   Ford's speech remains slurred and his balance off-kilter, but
his doctors said they expect him to eventually recover all of his
physical abilites. He has no brain damage, and his cognitive
abilites are unimpaired, they said.
</P>
<P>
   Ford will remain hospitalized for five to six days, while tests
are run to determine the extent and precise location of the
blockage of blood flow to his brain, his doctors said.
</P>
<P>
   Though Ford appears to be stable, stroke specialists said the
next two days are critical, and the aging ex-president cannot be
definitively pronounced out of the woods without several successive
days of improvement.
</P>
<P>
   Ford's doctors said his minor brain-stem strokes were likely the
product of atherosclerosis, the buildup of fatty deposits blood
vessels, typically caused by high blood pressure, smoking, high
cholesterol or diabetes. But otherwise, his prognosis was good.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's saying that he feels great and would like to get home.''
Dr. Carol Thomas of Hahnemann University Hospital.
</P>
<P>
   News of Ford's malady generated quick bipartisan expressions of
sympathy.
</P>
<P>
   ``The president spoke with Mrs. Ford to express his concern and
best wishes for a speedy recovery,'' said President Clinton's
spokesman Elliot Diringer.
</P>
<P>
   On Tuesday night, Ford, the 38th president, sat with his wife,
Betty, with George and Barbara Bush, and with Nancy Reagan as
Republican convention-goers paid tribute to the three living GOP
presidents.
</P>
<P>
   The elder Bush said in a statement: ``It was a joy to sit next
to him at the convention (Tuesday night). ... Once again, we were
reminded of his dececncy and all that he did at a crucial time in
our nation's history.''
</P>
<P>
   After a triumphant arrival in Philadelphia Wednesday, George W.
Bush also called Mrs. Ford to convey his concern.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was saddened to hear that President Gerald Ford was admitted
to the hospital after the glowing tribute he received (Tuesday
night),'' the GOP presidential nominee said in a statement.
``Americans love Gerald and Betty Ford for their integrity, wisdom
and compassion.''
</P>
<P>
   Ford's condition was intially misdiagnosed as a sinus infection.
He checked into Hahnemann University Hospital's emergency room
Wednesday at 1 a.m. complaining of pain in his tongue, and sought
only pain relief, said doctors.
</P>
<P>
   His personal doctor had been following his condition and
reported the symptoms to the hospital. They diagnosed it as an
acute sinus infection, gave him pain killers and released him.
</P>
<P>
   Later that morning, journalists and friends noticed his slurred
speech and often puzzling responses to questions. On C-SPAN he
answered a question about Iraq by holding forth on onions.
</P>
<P>
   At 9 a.m., Ford walked back into the hospital under his own
power. Mrs. Betty Ford told doctors she had noticed his slurred
speech for several days, and they quickly concluded the
ex-president had suffered a stroke.
</P>
<P>
   At a news conference, Hahnemann officals said their treatment
during Ford's first visit to the hospital was appropriate. They
said the did not conduct tests for a stroke at that time because of
incomplete information from Ford and his personal physician.
</P>
<P>
   Some stroke specialists said the activity Ford engaged in before
his stroke treatment _ interviews before jostling cameras and hot
lights _ may slightly hamper his recovery.
</P>
<P>
   Ford is being treated with drugs that help unclog arteries.
Doctors said the crucial task now is to identify the exact nature
of his stroke.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's incumbent on the doctors to settle the issue of what
caused the stroke in order to prevent a more serious stroke,'' said
Dr. Philip J. Kistler, director of stroke service at Massachusetts
General Hospital.
</P>
<P>
   Ford took office in 1974, after Richard M. Nixon resigned as
president to avoid being impeached for Watergate. Ford pardoned
Nixon, a controversial decision that clouded his tenure. In 1976,
he lost the presidency to Jimmy Carter.

NO GRASS GROWS UNDER GRACE'S FEET

(Eds: Fact box below) 
Our rating: 3 stars 
By DAVID KRONKE 
c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News 
<TEXT>
<P>
   ``Saving Grace'' is a British pot comedy that even the
generations that came of age before marijuana insinuated itself
into mainstream culture can appreciate. Call it ``Toking Weed
Divine'' and you wouldn't be too far off the mark.
</P>
<P>
   Brenda Blethyn (an Oscar nominee for both ``Secrets and Lies''
and ``Little Voice'') stars as the Grace in question, a woman whose
husband died jumping out of an airplane without a parachute and
left her beyond her ears in debt. She's left so deeply in hock, in
fact, that she risks losing her centuries-old home in the small but
utterly scenic town of Cornwall, as well as all its contents.
</P>
<P>
   Salvation, of a curious sort, comes to her in the form of her
ne'er-do-well gardener Matthew (``The Drew Carey Show's'' Craig
Ferguson), who's also a grave digger and has been supplying the
surrounding populace with marijuana, a potent blend that he's not
terribly adept at growing. The two transplant the plants to her
greenhouse with amazing results: the hyper-electrical glow of her
intensive growth plan becomes an eventful, nightly light show for
the locals, and the result, as she herself soon can attest _
through a severe case of the giggles _ is primo stuff, worth
hundreds of thousands of British pounds.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, there are plenty of obstacles in the way of Grace's
solvency. Matthew's secretly pregnant girlfriend Nicky (Valerie
Edmond) suddenly takes a dim view of his entrepreneurialism, the
local constabulary may not be as clueless as it seems, and there's
the small matter of finding a dealer powerful and ruthless enough
to move so much weed.
</P>
<P>
   ``Saving Grace'' veers frequently and dangerously toward playing
as a little too cute, but it's rescued by a number of sage and
funny performances. Blethyn, for one, isn't nearly so strident as
she was in her Oscar-nominated turns. A scene in which she
confidently confronts her husband's mistress (Diana Quick), only to
have her illusions shattered by the woman (who later turns out to
be an ally), is a minor masterpiece of acting, as is the sequence
in which she tests her product personally with Matthew.
</P>
<P>
   Ferguson (who co-wrote the film with Mark Crowdy) charms in an
easy, off-handed way, and Martin Clunes, who gave a brilliantly
showy performance in a recent BBC America production, ``Sex &AMP;
Death,'' nearly steals the show as the town's physician who,
despite his intense denials, obviously does inhale. Phyllida Law
(Emma Thompson's mother) and Linda Kerr Scott have a couple of
priceless scenes as local biddies who mistake Grace's stash for tea
leaves and are uproariously transformed.
</P>
<P>
   Sundance Film Festival audiences named ``Saving Grace'' their
favorite movie this year, and it's certainly a crowd pleaser, even
if its conclusion is both wildly silly and more than a little pat.
Director Nigel Cole exploits his gorgeous locations to more than
ample effect (though a couple of key scenes seem to have been left
on the editing-room floor). You'll laugh, irresistibly, and you
won't even suffer from a case of the munchies afterward. &QL;

   Pasadena's Red Delicious has ridden the Internet to world
exposure. However, in doing so the trio fears it might have
downloaded a bit of a backlash.
</P>
<P>
   The group, which spent several months at the top of MP3.com's
charts last year and two weeks ago won the best unsigned band
online trophy at the third annual Yahoo! Internet Life Online Music
Awards at New York's Studio 54, is beginning to think its fame on
the World Wide Web could hurt it in the music industry's corridors
of power.
</P>
<P>
   ``The major labels could look at us and think we're consorting
with the enemy,'' says Red Delicious singer Sara Wallace. ``But, on
the other hand, we wouldn't have gotten this far without the
Internet. We'd be sitting here waiting for something to happen.''
</P>
<P>
   Word is certainly out on Red Delicious, whose melodic sound
blends alt-rock with hip-hop and electronic elements. The trio,
which also includes keyboardist Rob King and guitarist Steve Baca,
packed the House of Blues and the Viper Room last winter. The group
is currently working out dates for later this summer.
</P>
<P>
   Last summer, as a result of winning an MP3.com contest, the
20-something trio played its first-ever show, opening for Tom Petty
at the 16,000-seat Verizon Wireless Amphitheatre in Irvine.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were kind of at the forefront of the Internet when it
really blew up last year,'' King says. The band has been featured
in the Wall Street Journal, the New York Times and on ``CBS News
with Dan Rather.''
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Internet revenues bring in about $1,200 a month for
the band, whose members have used the money to promote and
manufacture their first album, ``Emotional Blur'' (available only
at www.mp3.com/reddelicious), buy musical equipment and travel to
New York, where they picked up the Yahoo! award.
</P>
<P>
   The idea to seek fans online started as a lark when King decided
to place three Red Delicious songs on MP3.com early last year and
promptly forgot about it. MP3.com soon became the largest
repository of free music on the Web.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had a few downloads but I figured nobody would hear us at
all,'' he said. ``Then, someone at MP3.com must've liked us because
within a week we were a featured band, which meant we had the
site's front page with a picture and an article that linked to our
music.''
</P>
<P>
   Just as that was taking place, the Internet music revolution
exploded in the media and Red Delicious' downloads went from a
handful to 1,200 a day along with about 100 e-mails daily. The trio
found itself in MP3.com's Top 10.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everyone knows who we are in the industry by now,'' King said.
``After we won the Yahoo! award, that sealed the deal about being
an Internet band. There's almost a backlash because of the press
we've had. We might have been overexposed as an Internet band when
in reality we never intended to be that. It was a fluke that we
took off online.''
</P>
<P>
   King says Red Delicious was close to signing with a major label
last year, but the deal fell through as a result of a corporate
merger.
</P>
<P>
   ``There was a backlash,'' Baca says. ``The record companies were
saying they didn't want to take a chance on the first superstar
Internet band.''
</P>
<P>
   But Tim Devine, senior vice president of a&AMP;r (artists and
repertoire) at Columbia Records, says a band's popularity on the
Internet could be one of the elements to attract a major label.
</P>
<P>
   ``If they're getting plenty of downloads and have widespread
name recognition, that takes care of part of our job in breaking an
act,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Baca, who grew up in Arleta, says that even without major label
support and while the band members work day jobs, they haven't had
to shell out for band support or upkeep of their own Web site,
www.red-delicious.com.
</P>
<P>
   ``It takes a lot of money to keep a band running,'' he explains.
``Any band has to work a day gig, plus pay for rehearsal space,
gear and promotion in order to keep going. It costs tons of money.
We're able to support the band and nobody has to pay for
anything.''
</P>
<P>
   Formed in spring 1998, the trio came together when the
production team of King and Baca (billed as King and Little Steven)
met Wallace at a session.
</P>
<P>
   Baca had been a member of Vanity Kills, which released an album
on Hollywood Records in 1991 while King spent several years
producing and engineering various bands. Wallace had performed
locally for two years with her band Starblind.
</P>
<P>
   ``There was something about Sara's voice,'' King says. ``We knew
we could do something together. We want to make timeless music,
like Sarah McLachlan.''
</P>
<P>
   While Red Delicious waits to sign with a label, there are plenty
of places to hear their very appealing music.
</P>
<P>
   Along with MP3.com and the Red Delicious site, the trio's music
can be downloaded at more than a dozen locations on the Web,
including www.billboard.com, www.napster.com, www.rollingstone.com,
www.hob.com and www.farmclub.com.!end!

CONVENTION CRESTS ATOP A WAVE OF DONATIONS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By GLEN JOHNSON  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHILADELPHIA _ Robin Cook wended his way through the floor of
the Republican National Convention with all the appropriate
credentials hanging around his neck. But the only one he truly
needed was pinned to the lapel of his crisp blue blazer.
</P>
<P>
   Against a black field was a gold elephant and the words:
``Republican Regents.''
</P>
<P>
   This year, that nametag confers singular status as the most
elite of party donors, the 139 people and corporations who have
contributed $250,000 or more to Republican causes since January
1999. It carries with it an all-access pass to the best hotels,
meals and parties around Philadelphia, a city bustling with lavish
spreads and entertainment ranging from The Temptations to Hank
Williams Jr.
</P>
<P>
   The critics bray, but Cook, a Boston novelist with a specialty
for medical thrillers, defends his sort of big-ticket giving. He
says he's not buying access, but supporting good leadership in the
form of Republican presidential candidate George W. Bush.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm quite impressed with the whole Bush clan, and I'd like to
see that kind of integrity in the White House, so I don't have to
be embarrassed when I go over and meet with my friends in Europe,''
he said shortly after the convention was gaveled to order.
</P>
<P>
   Larry Makinson, head of the Center for Responsive Politics, a
Washington campaign finance watchdog, thinks the money both in
Philadelphia and the Democratic National Convention in Los Angeles
in two weeks perverts the political process.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you can put together a $400,000 bash with shrimp and
caviar, you have an advantage over everyone not doing it. When
those groups come back to Washington to really undertake the
business of government, they know they are not just walking into
the door as any other person,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Both the Republican and Democrats expect to spend over $100
million presenting their presidential and vice presidential
nominees. With the US Treasury and local governments providing only
about $28 million to each party, a hefty share of the rest will
come from corporate sponsorships and private donors.
</P>
<P>
   Individual donations to presidential candidates are capped at
$1,000 for the primaries and $1,000 for the general election, but
``soft-money'' donations to political parties remain unregulated
despite attempts by campaign finance reformers such as Senators
John McCain of Arizona and Russell Feingold of Wisconsin, and
Representatives Martin T. Meehan of Massachusetts and Christopher
Shays of Connecticut.
</P>
<P>
   Corporations were briefly banned from helping defray convention
expenses, but in 1984, federal regulators changed the rules so
companies could make unlimited donations to host committees, the
civic groups that arrange much of the convention-week activities.
The donations were also made tax deductible, to be treated as a
marketing expense.
</P>
<P>
   Adding to the money flow is the presence of top lawmakers,
government decisionmakers and corporate interests at conventions.
Their attendance provides the opportunity to both thank past donors
and cultivate new ones, as has happened in Philadelphia this week.
</P>
<P>
   The National Republican Congressional Committee raised $1.75
million and rewarded its donors with 345 hotel rooms in prime
locations. The contributors also received passes for a hospitality
suite, a golf tournament and a concert by Earth, Wind &AMP; Fire.
</P>
<P>
   Union Pacific Railroad laid a half-mile of railroad track
outside the First Union Center and placed 30 vintage railroad cars
right next to the convention hall for parties. It lent a Pullman
car to House Minority Whip Tom DeLay of Texas, who is using it as a
hospitality suite for his ``Gold Plus'' contributors, those who
have donated $50,000 to his political action committee. Besides the
donors, the only ones allowed admittance are members of Congress.
</P>
<P>
   House Speaker Dennis Hastert was both the host and honoree
Tuesday at a luncheon in the Pennsylvania Convention Center. He
invited 1,000 people who have supported his political action
committee, ``Keep Our Majority.''
</P>
<P>
   The event was sponsored by Akin, Gump, a top Washington law and
lobbying firm, as well as the National Beer Wholesalers and
Retailers and the United Distillers and Vintners. The guest of
honor was Dick Cheney, the GOP vice presidential pick, and the
emcee was former Representative William Paxon of New York, now a
member of Akin, Gump.
</P>
<P>
   Wednesday, there was also a fund-raising luncheon featuring the
party's presidential choice, Texas Governor George W. Bush, that
was expected to raise up to $10 million. And earlier this week,
there were dueling corporate-sponsored parties for Represenatives
W.J. ``Billy'' Tauzin of Lousiana and Michael G. Oxley of Ohio, who
are battling to become the next chairman of the House Commerce
Committee.
</P>
<P>
   ``Conventions are about politics, getting the message out, but
they're also a celebration of a lot of hard work and grassroots and
party leaders who get together every four years to tell war stories
_ and spend the week going to good parties,'' said Ronald Kaufman,
a Bush confidant and Massachusetts national committeeman.
</P>
<P>
   He said he had received ``hundreds'' of invitations.
</P>
<P>
   Similar attention is paid to Cook and his fellow Regents. They
sit atop a caste system that includes Team 100, the $100,000
donors, the Presidential Trust, whose members have donated $20,000,
and the Eagles, people who have given $15,000.
</P>
<P>
   Team 100 members had more than two dozen perks and events to
choose from this week, according to The Associated Press, which
obtained letters mailed to the donors.
</P>
<P>
   They had dinner their first night with Hastert, Senate Majority
Leader Trent Lott and other congressional leaders at the
Philadelphia Museum of Art, the AP reported. The next day, it was
breakfast at City Hall with strategists from the Bush campaign,
followed by a fashion show at the Academy of Music and a cocktail
reception with GOP members of Congress.
</P>
<P>
   Wednesday they enjoyed a round of country-club golf with
senators, congressmen, governors and former Cabinet members.
Thursday there's brunch with Bush's father, former President Bush.
President Ford had been scheduled to attend before he was
hospitalized Wednesday after suffering two mild strokes.
</P>
<P>
   Even though their $15,000 donations place them at the bottom of
the pecking order, the Eagles are treated like royalty, as well.
</P>
<P>
   On Monday they had lunch at Ardosson, Robert Montgomery Scott's
famed Villanova home, enjoyed reserved motorcoaches to and from the
convention hall and had a special late-night concert featuring
Lynard Skynard. All week the Eagles are free to drop by a
hospitality suite at their hotel, the Park Hyatt in Center City.
</P>
<P>
   Kaufman, the Massachusetts committeeman, dismisses those who say
the cash flow erodes democracy.
</P>
<P>
   ``The party can foot the bill for the convention itself, but
every four years, every major business or political leader comes
together in one of two places,'' he said. ``If you're Chrysler
trying to sell automobiles or Voter.com trying to reach a political
audience, what place is there better to go?''

<TEXT>
<P>
   A ``coyote ugly'' person is one who is so physically ghastly
that, upon waking up hungover with him or her asleep on your arm,
you would gladly gnaw that appendage off _ like a coyote caught in
a trap _ to escape rather than awaken or have to speak to that
monstrosity ever again. Similarly, ``Coyote Ugly'' the movie is so
narratively ghastly that, were you handcuffed to your seat, you
would cheerfully bid your arm adieu and chew your way to freedom to
avoid allowing any more idiocy to seep into your central nervous
system.
</P>
<P>
   Piper Perabo stars as Violet, an innocent, small-town Jersey
girl with dreams of making it big in New York Ci... see, I can
tell, I've lost you already. Through the usual series of
contrivances, she ends up working as an uber-attitudinal
bartender/dancer at Coyote Ugly, which is sort of a Chuck E. Cheese
for misogynists (women do patronize the place, however, but only
when called for by the, um, plot).
</P>
<P>
   The other women at the bar are defined by the one character
trait Gina Wendkos' script allows them: Lil (Maria Bello), the
tough boss with a heart of _ well, !ital!something; Rachel (Bridget
Moynahan), the grouchy one; Cammie (Izabella Miko), the shopaholic
(yes, there's a trying-on-clothes montage); and Zoe (Tyra Banks),
the law student _ anyone who saw Banks' pre-Oscar ceremony
performance would know to fear for the legal profession. Director
David McNally shoots their bartop dancing two ways: above the
waist, so you can see the actresses, and below the waist, so you
can see their stand-ins' precision hoofing.
</P>
<P>
   To prove she can write pointless scenes for both genders,
Wendkos also gives Violet a boyfriend (Adam Garcia) and a
disapproving dad (John Goodman, playing another variation on his
patented fat-guy-who-can't- say-no-to-junk-food character _ no
offense, John, but maybe Hollywood's trying to tell you something).
</P>
<P>
   It's Perabo's movie and she knows it, all too well; her perky,
quirky performance is far too exhaustingly calculated to charm. Her
unrelenting emoting, particularly during the scenes designated in
the script as ``sad,'' makes this the first movie that could've
used an eyebrow wrangler. Similarly annoying in ``The Adventures of
Rocky and Bullwinkle,'' Perabo was but a cameo in ``Battlefield
Earth'' from winning the summer's Triple Crown.
</P>
<P>
   ``Coyote Ugly'' is, at its heart, an R-rated movie aimed at frat
boys shoehorned into an ungainly PG-13 body _ which means,
essentially, it has none of the gratuitous nudity that movies of
this ilk are generally expected to have. Which, obviously, wouldn't
make the movie any better, but it would at least give its target
audience a reason to sit through it.
</P>
<P>
   So you can look at the movie one of two ways: that the movie
becomes high-minded in its refusal to commit to its sleazy
sensibility, or that since it's still clearly cashing in on said
sleazy sensibility, its inability to follow through simply
underscores the filmmakers' cynicism and gutlessness. &QL;

<TEXT>
<P>
   Clint Eastwood's latest geezer fantasy is, basically, John Glenn
does ``Armageddon.'' Amiable to a fault _ by the time things mosey
around to a save-the-world third act, any potential for suspense
has been pleasantly frittered away _ ``Space Cowboys'' is much more
successful as an easygoing character comedy than as awesome
astronaut adventure. Wrinkled charm is this vehicle's real solid
fuel.
</P>
<P>
   The concept could not be simpler, nor a more comfortable fit for
its macho-mellow stars. Eastwood's Frank, Tommy Lee Jones' Hawk,
Donald Sutherland's Jerry and James Garner's Tank were all hotshot
test pilots in the 1950s (the very nice, black-and-white opening
flashback offers young ringers for the famous actors dubbed by the
icons' unmistakable voices) who were bypassed for the space program
when NASA commandeered it from the Air Force.
</P>
<P>
   Forty-some years later, a key Russian communications satellite's
orbit is degrading, and it can only be fixed Up There. Since all
the current astronauts are too young to understand the obsolete
bird's operational system, the space program has to turn to the guy
who designed it _ that's right, Frank.
</P>
<P>
   What his work is doing in a 30-year-old Soviet craft is a good
question that is later answered in the most alarming way imaginable
(it's a Clint movie, so even though they may not be commies
anymore, you still can't trust those Russkies). Time's running out,
the vice president insists we help, and so Frank's hated ex-boss,
Gerson (James Cromwell), now a NASA bigwig, has to agree to the
snarling senior's demand that his old team be sent up on the
mission.
</P>
<P>
   If, of course, they can pass the physical. Training turns out to
be ``Space Cowboys''' most genial stretch, as the old buckaroos do
their best to feign fitness for the assignment. After all these
years, Tank's devolved into a boring, scatterbrained Baptist
minister, half-blind Jerry is happy test-driving roller coasters
and young mistresses, and Hawk, who has the most contentious
relationship with Frank, still hasn't gotten over his beloved
wife's death.
</P>
<P>
   But, of course, they all want their long-postponed shot at
space. Prep time, some of which was filmed at the actual Johnson
Space Center and Cape Canaveral in Florida, is a jokey affair; the
boys are constantly told about old colleagues who've died and the
few still around inevitably greet Frank with a cheery, ``You never
were a team player.''
</P>
<P>
   Despite the supposed urgency of the situation, there is time for
a May-December romance (Marcia Gay Hardin is the comely scientist
half), a bar brawl and new Clint one-liners like ``Clock's ticking,
Bob, and I'm only getting older.'' Later, there's a cancer scare,
orbital complications and opportunities for noble self-sacrifice.
</P>
<P>
   It all gets steadily more preposterous, and the dramatic
possibilities in the seniors' frailties remain frustratingly
unexplored.
</P>
<P>
   But you do leave the proceedings going ``Old guys rule!'' The
superannuated ensemble serves up effortless rapport, and it's all
agreeable, midrange Eastwood entertainment, nothing profound but
put across with smooth aplomb by his usual crack team of
cinematographer Jack N. Green, production designer Henry Bumstead
and composer Lennie Niehaus.
</P>
<P>
   Even though ``Space Cowboys'' is fundamentally meaningless, I
have little doubt that in a quarter century or so, it'll mean a
whole lot more to me. &QL;

NOT SEEING IS BELIEVING

<P>
   Before it could be seen, ``Hollow Man'' needed some fleshing
out.
</P>
<P>
   It took 11 years to get the right script and develop the
computer technology that put the guts and bones on this project.
What gave it life was a director who could combine the elements
without sacrificing technology or softening the demonic central
character.
</P>
<P>
   Paul Verhoeven relishes that sort of challenge.
</P>
<P>
   The Dutch filmmaker, whose last project was the 1997 film
``Starship Troopers'' and who is currently in talks to do the
sequel to his sexually charged ``Basic Instinct'' (even though he
doesn't normally do sequels), is admittedly drawn to projects that
explore the dark side of human nature.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hollow Man'' is a suspense-thriller about a cocky young
scientist who injects himself with an invisibility serum being
commissioned for top- secret study by the government. The bad news
is the serum is irreversible. That leaves the now-invisible
scientist with only one choice _ to become a monster.
</P>
<P>
   ``The story was really about a man deteriorating because of the
power of invisibility,'' says Verhoeven.
</P>
<P>
   The film, opening citywide today, parallels the centuries-old
writings of Plato, who said that a man who becomes invisible will
steal, rape, kill and anoint himself god among men, much as
Sebastian does when he becomes the Hollow Man.
</P>
<P>
   Movies have always had a fascination with invisibility on the
screen, as exemplified by the 1933 film ``The Invisible Man,''
which was considered a special-effects wonder in its day.
</P>
<P>
   Verhoeven admits the idea of a murderous invisible man appealed
to him.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's probably why I took the script,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   Hooking Verhoeven was the easy part, says producer Douglas Wick.
It was the long process of bringing the project to the screen that
was difficult.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hollow Man'' was Wick's baby. No stranger to revolutionary
effects _ he is credited with producing such visual extravaganzas
as ``Stuart Little'' and ``Gladiator'' _ Wick knew computer
technology could provide a new perspective to the story.
</P>
<P>
   ``Every movie has its stumble factor. When you get to an
invisible man, the bad version of invisibility is really silly.
Remember `Memoirs of an Invisible Man'?'' Wick says, referring to
the 1993 film starring Chevy Chase and Daryl Hannah.
</P>
<P>
   ``The toughest thing about this is to make the audience believe
the experience all the way through.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Hollow Man'' stars Kevin Bacon as Sebastian Caine, the dynamic
and powerful government scientist who secretly uses the serum on
himself. When his colleagues Linda McKay (Elisabeth Shue) and
Matthew Kensington (Josh Brolin) try to turn him in, all hell
breaks loose.
</P>
<P>
   All this happens under the anonymity of his invisibility, thanks
to the new software developed under the watchful eye of visual
effects supervisor Scott Anderson and his team at Sony Pictures
Imageworks.
</P>
<P>
   Anderson, who has worked on special-effects giants like ``Babe''
and Verhoeven's ``Starship Troopers,'' admits all his other
projects are dwarfed by what was done in ``Hollow Man.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think everyone understands how hard it was to do, and
it's really not their job to understand it,'' says Anderson. ``They
just have to enjoy the movie.''
</P>
<P>
   Scanning every inch of Bacon's body allowed the visual artists
to show his transformation from flesh to muscle to skeleton to
invisible man and almost back again.
</P>
<P>
   Only Sebastian's outline is visible in water or smoke scenes.
But in reality, Bacon was in almost every scene of the movie
wearing different-colored body suits specific to the environment.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's all me,'' Bacon says. ``Whenever I'm there, you hear the
voice, you see the CGI (computer graphics imaging), you see the
water man, you see the smoke man, you see the rain man, you see the
electrodes, you see the sheath. I was there for every single
thing.''
</P>
<P>
   The only scene that required a greater imagination was, perhaps,
during a mad gorilla scene in the early part of the movie.
</P>
<P>
   Fortunately, Verhoeven _ who went so far as to remove his
trousers for the coed shower scene during the filming of ``Starship
Troopers'' as an act of camaraderie with his actors _ is a great
motivator.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you're trying to look at the gorilla or you're trying to
imagine what it is,'' says Bacon, ``all of a sudden he's screaming
and jumping around the set like a gorilla. He has a mercurial kind
of personality. It explodes at any minute.''
</P>
<P>
   Bacon describes Verhoeven as director who has a
single-mindedness when it comes to getting a job done. He is also
compassionate. He shut down production for six weeks to allow Shue,
who had torn her Achilles tendon doing gymnastics off the set, to
heal.
</P>

SOME NURSES, UNHAPPY PROFESSIONALLY, TALK REVOLT 
</HEADLINE>

 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Besieged by staffing cuts and deteriorating working conditions,
some Massachusetts nurses have decided to update their profession's
mild, nurturing image with a little more radical fire.
</P>
<P>
   They are urging the Massachusetts Nurses Association to split
off from its national parent organization, which they call too
moderate for an era when nursing is, in their words, ``in chaos and
facing extinction.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We need a revolution in health care,'' said Peggy O'Malley,
55, a nurse on disability leave from Brigham and Women's Hospital
in Boston who is campaigning for the split.
</P>
<P>
   Sounding a little less like Florence Nightingale and a bit more
like Karl Marx, leaders of the Massachusetts Nurses Association's
organized labor branch recently proposed the split from the
American Nursing Association. They were emboldened by their
successful April strike at St. Vincent Hospital in Worcester, Mass.
The strike showed nurses that they could score victories by linking
their labor issues to public concern about cost-cutting in health
care.
</P>
<P>
   The proposal has sparked a fierce debate within the
Massachusetts Nurses Association, where some call proponents of
secession ``too militant'' and suggest they are taking out their
frustration over problems that managed care has caused nurses.
</P>
<P>
   The secession movement is building as the American Nursing
Association insists that it has finally embraced a role as a
national labor union _ largely at the prompting of the
Massachusetts group. The MNA, with 18,000 members, makes up
one-tenth of the national association's numbers.
</P>
<P>
   Members of the Massachusetts group will decide the issue in a
Nov. 9 vote that will help shape the future of the organization,
which now operates both as a traditional labor union and as a
professional association for unionized nurses, nurse managers, and
educators. A two-thirds majority is needed for a split; at stake is
the $1 million in annual dues that now goes to the national
association. The Maine Nurses Association is planning a similar
vote.
</P>
<P>
   The argument goes beyond organizational infighting. Nurses are
debating how they view themselves and their profession _ and
particularly, how strongly to identify with organized labor.
</P>
<P>
   ``The image within the ANA is of the nurse as someone who
serves'' the cause of medicine, said Tom Juravich, director of the
University of Massachusetts Labor Center and author of
``Commonwealth of Toil,'' a labor history of the state. Unionized
nurses are more assertive, he said, characterizing their approach
as, ``We don't simply serve; we make our own fortunes.''
</P>
<P>
   But the national organization has changed, said Michelle Nawar,
a spokeswoman for United American Nurses, the ANA union founded
last year. While the national group was long ambivalent, she said,
nowadays even members who do not themselves support unions
recognize that the ANA should lead the way in organizing nurses.
</P>
<P>
   ``The tide is turning,'' she said. ``What we're asking is that
they wait and give the (United American Nurses) a chance.''
</P>
<P>
   Too late, said O'Malley, who is campaigning for the split.
Nurses in Massachusetts, where managed care has hit harder than in
many states, are on the ``front lines'' and ``can't afford to be
moderate,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think doctors are going to lead it, and I don't think
patients are able to lead it,'' she said. ``Nurses are leading it,
and it's nothing less than a revolution. It's a social movement.
And we've gotten much more comfortable with that as nurses.''
</P>
<P>
   Not everyone is comfortable with such unbending language, even
in the generally prolabor Massachusetts group. Meg Perry, 55, a
staff nurse at Cambridge (Mass.) Hospital, opposes the split,
saying union leaders who spend days negotiating contracts should
value compromise.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you have differences within a family, you sit down and
work it out. You don't just pack up your bags,`` Perry said.
</P>
<P>
   The national association has had its problems, including a $3
million deficit last year, but it is doing its best to address
them, Perry said. ANA membership gives Massachusetts nurses more
national clout, as well as access to a professional network, she
added. ``There's a lot to lose that people are not going to be
aware of until they reach for it and it's not there.''
</P>
<P>
   Both the Massachusetts and national groups say they want to
strengthen nurses' unions, increase access to health care, and
maintain staffing levels so that nurses don't have to work
mandatory overtime and patient safety is not compromised.
</P>
<P>
   But the ANA was slower to take those positions, prompting the
California Nurses Association to secede in 1995. The ANA adopted a
resolution against mandatory overtime only in June _ after the St.
Vincent strike in Worcester made national headlines.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps the biggest difference between the Massachusetts and
national groups centers on attitudes toward labor.
</P>
<P>
   The MNA has been unionizing nurses since the 1960s. The ANA,
trying to appeal to union and nonunion states alike, waited until
last year to create its national union. The MNA refused to join it,
arguing that its structure left it open to management influence,
which the ANA denies.
</P>
<P>
   MNA leaders who want a split complain that while 68 percent of
ANA dues come from staff nurses, 56 percent of the delegates who
set its agenda are from management or academia and are less likely
to be concerned about rank-and-file nursing issues. The ANA says it
does not keep track of the dues breakdown but points out that its
union has its own all-labor governing body and a budget of $3.5
million.
</P>
<P>
   Teachers, musicians, and actors have had similar arguments over
whether they are best represented by unions or professional groups.
But the nurses' debate resonates more strongly with the public,
Juravich said, because unions have worked hard to define the plight
of nurses in terms of larger societal issues such as access to
health care.
</P>
<P>
   That feeling was audible at a recent lunch at the 99 Restaurant,
not far from the state group's headquarters, where several members
used sweeping terms in their pitch for secession.
</P>
<P>
   ``The MNA is committed to a radical transformation of the health
care system in Massachusetts, to getting the corporations and the
insurance companies out of the picture,'' said Sandy Eaton, 56.
``The MNA is my political party.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We're organizing nurses for political action,'' said Karen
Higgins, 46, the MNA's elected chair of labor relations. She dubbed
the ANA's union ``a piece of fluff.''
</P>
<P>
   MNA president Karen Daley, who opposes the split, said the fact
that nurses' issues affect all of society means that the group
should see the value in taking a more moderate approach at times.
</P>
<P>
   ``Collective bargaining is only one tool,'' she said. But to
influence public policy, ``you also have to have access and
respect'' in places such as Washington.
</P>
<P>
   Both sides insist that nurses can think of themselves as
professionals and union members at the same time. Said Higgins:
``We're using collective bargaining as a tool to defend our
profession.''

Geezers in space: The joke gets old fast
<TEXT>
<P>
   By ERIC HARRISON
</P>
<P>
   Houston Chronicle
</P>
<P>
   A movie-length reel could be made out of all the scenes in which
Clint Eastwood glares across a desk at some paper-pushing,
career-protecting, rule-obsessed boss.
</P>
<P>
   Surely NASA knew when it gave its blessing to Space Cowboys, the
new Eastwood movie that was filmed partly in Houston, that it
wouldn't be portrayed in a flattering light. A glance at the script
shouldn't even have been necessary.
</P>
<P>
   Eastwood's character, Frank Corvin, led an Air Force team in
1958 that felt it was cheated out of the chance to become the first
to go into outer space. Now, more than 40 years later, the man who
humiliated him back then by sending a chimpanzee into orbit is now
a top bureaucrat at NASA, and he needs Corvin's help.
</P>
<P>
   Instantly, the stage is set in this rather schizophrenic
sci-fi/action/comedy for the kind of formulaic character conflict
we've come to expect.
</P>
<P>
   It seems that Corvin, the ace pilot, went on to design a
guidance system that somehow ended up in a Russian satellite _ how
this happened is kept a mystery until near the end of the movie,
but it never really generates the intended suspense.
</P>
<P>
   Now that satellite has suffered a systems failure and is
tumbling toward Earth. Its guidance system is so old that the
retired Corvin is the only man alive who knows how to fix it. He
sees this as a chance to reclaim his stolen glory.
</P>
<P>
   No, he tells Bob Gerson, that nasty NASA official (James
Cromwell), he won't train young astronauts to fix the problem. His
old Team Daedalus must be recalled into action.
</P>
<P>
   The other members, who all have 30 days to be turned into
astronauts, are Hawk (Tommy Lee Jones), Jerry (Donald Sutherland)
and Tank (James Garner).
</P>
<P>
   More improbable stories have been made into movies but few where
that improbability is the focus of so much of the film.
</P>
<P>
   Eastwood, who is 70 and also directed this movie, has joked in
interviews about the fantasy premise, which could be indelicately
summed up in the phrase ``geezers in space.'' Hardly a minute
passes in the movie's first two-thirds in which the heroes' age
isn't the main focus.
</P>
<P>
   Mostly it's played for laughs. Some of the bits are funny, and
none of it is particularly hard to sit through, but after a while
it gets kind of old.
</P>
<P>
   In the simple shorthand of sitcoms and commercial film, the
characters are largely defined by single, easily identifiable
traits. Hawk is the gifted but reckless pilot. Jerry is the vain,
old womanizer. Tank is ... still haven't figured out what Tank's
trait is, unless he's supposed to be the peace keeper. Of the
characters, he is the least defined.
</P>
<P>
   As for Corvin ... well, he's Eastwood _ flinty-eyed, determined,
a man's man who makes his own rules. More than once, he's told,
``Be a team player for once in your life.''
</P>
<P>
   Part of the film was shot at the Johnson Space Center as well as
the Kennedy Space Center at Cape Canaveral, Fla., and the
production touts that this is the first accurate representation of
Mission Control. Team Daedalus also is filmed undergoing training,
using the same expensive, high-tech equipment as real astronauts.
</P>
<P>
   This all is meant to enhance credibility, but why bother? The
NASA officials and engineers here are presented as realistically as
Loony Toons. Personal vendettas and hidden agendas motivate those
in charge. This is, of course, true of any organization, but Gerson
gets away with so much _ that Russian satellite figures in here _
that NASA seems to be an agency with no oversight.
</P>
<P>
   The tone of the movie changes completely in the last third. Team
Daedalus blasts off into space accompanied by two younger
astronauts who seem to know secrets about the mission that have
been withheld from Corvin and his men.
</P>
<P>
   It suddenly becomes a deadly serious outer-space adventure. This
part would seem grafted on as an afterthought were it not filmed
with such conviction. It generates the necessary tension. Still,
it's ludicrous how the folks at NASA are turned into ineffectual
spectators and hand-wringers when things get dicey.
</P>
<P>
   Just as quickly, the movie takes on overtones of sci-fi fantasy.
The astronauts go scooting through space like Rocketman, with power
packs strapped to their backs. It turns out they weren't sent to
repair a communications satellite after all, but something far more
deadly _ and more difficult to fix. Earth's future hangs in the
balance.
</P>
<P>
   It's not giving too much away to say that not everyone will make
it back to Earth.
</P>
<P>
   For this to work as powerfully as Eastwood intended, the
audience would have to care far more about the characters.
</P>
<P>
   Jones and Sutherland are wonderful actors _ it's a pleasure to
see them in almost anything _ and Jones' character is given a
little more of a back story. We like him more than the others. We
root for him to make it through.
</P>
<P>
   The re-entry into Earth's atmosphere is all Flash Gordon. We're
supposed to fret about whether they'll land successfully. We don't
fret _ is there any question? _ but, heck, it's still fun.
</P>
<P>
   But then Frank Sinatra comes on the soundtrack singing ``Fly Me
to the Moon.''
</P>
<P>
   It's obvious what they're going for here, but this isn't quite
the right tone to accompany what we have just seen. It might have
fit somewhere in the first two-thirds of the movie, but placed here
it's a bit jarring. It's another misstep in a movie that really
can't afford another one.
</P>

   BANGALORE, India _ The legendary outlaw Veerappan, a lean man
with a twirling, jet black mustache, has ranged through the vast
jungles of South India for a generation, slaughtering elephants for
their ivory tusks, smuggling out perfumed sandalwood and playing
Robin Hood to the forest dwellers, the authorities say.
</P>
<P>
   For the past decade, hundreds of policemen have been dedicated
to nothing but hunting him down. He is wanted for killing dozens of
them, as well as strangling his newborn daughter to silence her
telltale cries.
</P>
<P>
   He has eluded capture, but life on the run has taken a heavy
toll. He is in his 50s now, an aging brigand with asthma and a bad
stomach who has made no secret of his desire to come in from the
cold and live a normal life.
</P>
<P>
   On Sunday he put into action what the police are calling his
boldest, most diabolical plan yet to win a pardon for his crimes.
He abducted Rajkumar, a beloved movie star whose half-century-long
career portraying Hindu gods, kings of yore and heroes of every
kind has endowed him with a mythical stature of his own.
</P>
<P>
   Veerappan, who like many South Indians, including his captive,
goes by only one name, took Rajkumar to his jungle lair and has
kept silent about what he wants, letting the drama build. But the
police expect his demand to be simple: his freedom for Rajkumar's
life.
</P>
<P>
   A notorious gangster kidnapping a matinee idol would transfix
the public of any nation, but perhaps only in India would it
provoke mobs of fans to stone passing cars, blockade major roads
with flaming tires, press shopkeepers to pull down their shutters,
and bring life in a bustling metropolis to a halt.
</P>
<P>
   That is just what happened on Monday and Tuesday here in
Bangalore, the heart of India's booming information technology
industry and one of Asia's fastest-growing cities. Most people went
back to work Wednesday, but schools remained closed, a ban on
public gatherings stayed in place, traffic was light and anxiety
remained palpable.
</P>
<P>
   ``Bangalore is a cosmopolitan town, like Bombay,'' said U.R.
Ananthamurthy, a novelist and poet writing in Kannada, the native
tongue of most people in the state of Karnataka and the language
spoken by Rajkumar in his more than 200 films. ``It belongs to the
modern world system and thinks it can ignore mass psychology. But
it forgets that other reality that lurks within.''
</P>
<P>
   Here in South India, movie stars and their millions of fans can
be compared to religious deities and their devotees. Rajkumar, 72,
who came from a low-caste family and became a symbol of regional
pride, has inspired a huge and committed following.
</P>
<P>
   In Bangalore alone he has hundreds of fan clubs organized down
to the neighborhood level, like a political machine. But unlike
N.T. Rama Rao of Andhra Pradesh or M.G. Ramachandran of Tamil Nadu,
film stars, now dead, who became the chief ministers of their
states, Rajkumar has stayed out of politics _ and is all the more
trusted by his fans because of it.
</P>
<P>
   Thousands have flocked to his home weeping and chanting slogans
for his release.
</P>
<P>
   ``I worship Rajkumar as a god,'' said Nagaraj, a somber
22-year-old who pumps gas for a living. He wasn't being purely
metaphorical.
</P>
<P>
   South Indian movie stars who choose to play virtuous heroes and
mythological figures from the great Hindu epics are identified in
the minds of their audiences with those values, said Sara Dickey,
an anthropologist and author of ``Cinema and the Urban Poor in
South India'' (Cambridge University Press, 1993).
</P>
<P>
   ``It's easier in India for humans to become deities than in some
other cultures,'' Dickey said, ``certainly more than in the Western
Judeo-Christian traditions.''
</P>
<P>
   The drama is so like the plot of one of Rajkumar's films, and
the pairing of these two larger-than-life characters so perfect _
Rajkumar in his familiar role as the gentle hero and Veerappan as
the swashbuckling villain _ that the line between life and art
seems almost to have disappeared.
</P>
<P>
   Both men have gained maximum visibility in their respective
dominions. And for the police officers who have spent years chasing
Veerappan, the knowledge that he has Rajkumar is chilling.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's a cunning, ruthless criminal,'' said Maj. Gen. Shankar M.
Bidari, an inspector general in the Karnataka state police who
spent more than three years in the mid-1990s commanding 200 men in
pursuit of Veerappan. ``He wants to escape the clutches of the law,
and he will sacrifice anybody. He's tired. He's desperate. And he
knows there's no way out for him.''
</P>
<P>
   (OPTIONAL TRIM BEGINS)
</P>
<P>
   Veerappan has survived on his wits all these years in forests so
dense that the only way through them is on paths trod by elephants.
At the peak of his power in the 1980s he employed thousands of
people in his sandalwood lumbering empire and more than 100 armed
gangsters to keep everyone in line, Bidari said.
</P>
<P>
   Veerappan and his henchmen knew the ways of the jungle and
mimicked the calls of birds and deer in a system of warning signals
that helped them dodge the authorities.
</P>
<P>
   The people who lived on the fringes of the forest often
protected Veerappan because he was their patron. He gave them jobs,
helped the poorest among them to pay for their daughters' weddings,
built temples, and kept meddlesome bureaucrats away with
well-placed bribes, the police say.
</P>
<P>
   But his murderous tendencies became more pronounced as the years
went by, and in 1990 the states of Tamil Nadu and Karnataka set up
teams of officers to pursue the Veerappan gang into the jungles
that span their border.
</P>
<P>
   Ten years later, Veerappan stands charged with 141 murders but
is still at large _ a fact that goads his pursuers. Still, he has
been forced into a nomadic life that has worn him down, and cost
him most of his men, the police say. Dozens have been killed in
encounters with the police, and more than 100 have been arrested.
</P>
<P>
   Under interrogation, some have described their gang leader's
life as one of unceasing movement, with never more than a night of
sleep in any one camp. When it rains, he has only plastic sheeting
over his head. He eats dal and rice, buried at different spots in
the jungle, and wild boar and birds hunted in the jungle.
</P>
<P>
   ``He used to walk briskly in the forest,'' said C. Dinakar,
director general of the Karnataka state police, adding with
satisfaction: ``Now we have received information that he's slowed
down. He has breathing problems and diseases of the colon from
cooking in dirty water.''

 &HT;    POLICE, PROTESTERS FACE OFF AGAIN IN SWEATY, EDGY PHILADELPHIA
 &HT;    By BOB DART
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHILADELPHIA _ Police and protesters faced off at tense
demonstrations all across this sweaty, edgy city Wednesday but
avoided the violent clashes and snarled streets of the previous
day.
</P>
<P>
   Watched by legions of police, roaming bands of dissidents waved
placards and shouted slogans from morning to night but mostly
remained peaceful. The protests were miles from the heavily secured
sports arena where the Republican National Convention is being
held, but several occurred on sidewalks outside of hotels where
delegates are staying.
</P>
<P>
   Demonstrators opposed to the death penalty chanted ``You say
death row. We say hell no'' near the entrance to an arena where
Republican presidential nominee George W. Bush attended a noon
fund-raiser. Protesters against international corporations and the
World Bank blocked a sidewalk near City Hall. Hundreds of
demonstrators for dozens of causes pounded makeshift drums, danced,
chanted and waved signs in Franklin Park, near Chinatown, while
squads of police stood across the street with buses ready to haul
lawbreakers to jail.
</P>
<P>
   On Tuesday, at least 350 people were arrested and detained,
police said. Police Commissioner John Timoney was one of 15
officers slightly injured in clashes with protesters. The jailed
activists were not expected to be released until after the
convention ends Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   ``These are folks we know. They came in on buses hell-bent on
causing disruptions,'' Timoney told the Associated Press. ``The
vast majority are not cooperating with police by not giving their
names. We have lots of Jane and John Does.''
</P>
<P>
   Some of the protesters are members of a confederation of
anarchists called the ``Revolutionary Anti-Capitalists;'' the group
also calls itself the ``Black Bloc.'' They organize over the
Internet and communicate by cell phones on the street. Clad in
black or cut-off camouflage fatigues and sometimes wearing ski
masks or bandanas over their faces, they adopt fanciful nicknames
and distrust reporters as much as they do police.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not going to talk about the Black Bloc,'' said ``Ferret,''
who wore a T-shirt saying ``Anarchist Soccer.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We were playing some yesterday,'' he said of the fights with
police. He said he was a veteran of the anti-globalist protests in
Seattle and Washington, D.C., and presented a rumpled piece of
paper about why he came here for the Republican convention.
</P>
<P>
   ``Direct democracy starts here, in the streets of
Philadelphia,'' it said. ``No matter who they elect, we are still
ungovernable.''
</P>
<P>
   The activists have aroused anger rather than sympathy in the
Philly populace.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is Philadelphia. Protest was born here,'' said Willie
Jones, a security officer at the Municipal Building. ``But this is
not normal protest. This is violence. They have the right to free
speech but they don't have the right to come here to tear up our
town and endanger people's lives.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Law-abiding citizens are being intimidated,'' said Jones,
standing beside a newly cleaned statue of former Mayor Frank Rizzo
that had been painted by protesters.
</P>
<P>
   The police _ widely criticized for beating and kicking a
carjacking suspect earlier this summer _ are now being widely
praised for restraint.
</P>
<P>
   ``Usually you only hear about the bad cops, not the ones just
doing their jobs _ standing there and taking abuse from these
people,'' said Brian McIntosh, manager of Cosi Sandwich Bar in
Center City. ``Nobody knows what they're protesting about. I don't
think they even know.''
</P>
<P>
   While the conventioneers are spending freely in restaurants and
hotels, other businesses are suffering because of the disruptions.
Police on Wednesday had blocked the sidewalk on both sides of
Mickey Padel's news stand at the corner of 17th and Market Streets.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nobody can get here and this is usually my busy time,'' he
lamented at mid-morning. ``But I'm scared, too. Did you see what
happened yesterday?''
</P>
<P>
   The protest scenes contrast starkly to the GOP convention seen
on television. While the air-conditioned First Union Center is full
of mostly middle-aged men and women in business suits and silly
political gear, the sweltering street protests often feature young
tattooed, body-pierced activists in black cut-offs and T-shirts
with the sleeves ripped off. Working 12-hour shifts, the police are
hot and tired but struggling to maintain good humor.
</P>
<P>
   Pedaling from protest to protest in sweat-stained uniforms, a
bicycle patrol co-opted a favorite protest chant: ``What do we
want? Soap. When do we want it? Now,'' they said.

 BANGALORE, India: dirty water.''
<TEXT>
<P>
   Since 1994, Veerappan has made several attempts to surrender in
exchange for a pardon. In 1996 and 1997, he kidnapped batches of
people and demanded amnesty, but eventually freed his hostages when
he was refused. Then for several years, he simply dropped out of
sight _ until Sunday night.
</P>
<P>
   At 9:30 p.m., he and 11 of his gunmen strolled into Rajkumar's
farmhouse in the village of Gajanur in Tamil Nadu, just six miles
from the edge of the forest. The movie star was sitting on a couch
with his wife watching the local news. The couple recognized
Veerappan's trademark mustache.
</P>
<P>
   ``Why are you taking us?'' his wife, Parvathamma, recalled
asking. ``We've never done anything to you. We will give you
whatever we have.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I want only Sir,'' Veerappan replied respectfully, promising
that he would take care of her husband and proclaiming himself one
of the movie star's fans, and then threatening to kill him if she
notified the police after they left.
</P>
<P>
   ``You want me, take me,'' she said her husband firmly replied.
``But don't harm anyone else.''
</P>
<P>
   Veerappan gave Rajkumar an audiocassette and instructed her to
take it to the chief minister of Karnataka. He then picked up the
elderly actor's spectacles, tucked them into a pocket and led him
away, dressed only in loincloth, shirt and sandals. Three other
hostages were also taken.
</P>
<P>
   Parvathamma Rajkumar and two of her servants drove through the
night in a lashing rainstorm and reached the chief minister's
residence here in Bangalore after 2 a.m. Monday. They had called to
alert him.
</P>
<P>
   The tape revealed the kidnapper's only request: that an official
emissary be chosen to visit him and convey his demands. Later that
day, the Karnataka chief minister flew to Madras to meet with his
counterpart in Tamil Nadu. They agreed to dispatch a magazine
editor, R. Raja Gopal, as the emissary.
</P>
<P>
   Gopal headed into the jungle the next day, Tuesday, and has not
yet been heard from. Meanwhile, messages from Rajkumar's family
have been broadcast on All India Radio in hopes that he and his
abductor will hear them on the transistor radio that Veerappan
carries.
</P>
<P>
   ``I appeal to you in all humbleness and with love and affection
to send him home soon,'' Rajkumar pleaded. ``He has knee pain.
Don't make him walk. I trust in you.''
</P>
<P>
   On the streets outside the star's home, his fans gathered in
mute, anguished clumps Tuesday and Wednesday, though policemen
waving long wooden sticks kept chasing them away.
</P>
<P>
   As one fan, Byalapp Chandrashekar, 28, put it, ``We don't like
to see our god suffering.''

half century-long career portraying Hindu gods, ancient kings and
heroes of every kind has endowed the actor himself with mythical

CONSTRUCTION FIRM NAMED IN NEW BIAS SUIT 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (a and f coding)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JAMAL E. WATSON  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ An international construction firm recently ordered to
pay $1.3 million to settle racial discrimination and sexual
harassment claims has been accused by a Bay State man of of racism
while he worked for the company at a government construction site.
</P>
<P>
   Terrence A. Townsend, 36, who is black, alleges in a civil
lawsuit that while working for Foster Wheeler's Boston office he
was repeatedly subjected to racial slurs and had to use portable
toilets defaced with KKK graffiti.
</P>
<P>
   After Townsend complained to managers, his attorney says a white
co-workers handed him a hangman's noose and allegedly told him,
``The noose is for you in case you get out of hand.''
</P>
<P>
   Between 1995 and 1997, while monitoring air quality for Foster
Wheeler at an Environmental Protection Agency construction project
in Stratford, Conn., Townsend said he endured a hostile racial
climate that his superiors refused to do anything about.
</P>
<P>
   He also said that he and other black employees were repeatedly
given heavier workloads, more undesirable assignments, and paid far
less than their white counterparts.
</P>
<P>
   Townsend, who quit Foster Wheeler two years ago and now works
for another construction company, outlined his allegations in the
suit filed in Suffolk Superior Court. A trial is expected to begin
next month.
</P>
<P>
   ``Working at the site really put a lot of stress on me,'' said
Townsend, of suburban Canton, Mass. ``It's hard to believe that
this kind of discrimination still happens, especially on a
government contracted site.''
</P>
<P>
   Alastair Davie, a spokesman for Foster Wheeler, which is based
in New Jersey and employs 10,000 workers worldwide, refused comment
on Townsend's suit and would not discuss the company's policy on
workplace discrimination.
</P>
<P>
   A spokesperson at the EPA, which provided the contract to Foster
Wheeler for the Conneticut project, did not return several phone
calls.
</P>
<P>
   Four years ago, Darryl Nelson, a black man working in Foster
Wheeler's Chicago office, accused the company of fostering a
racially hostile environment for minority workers.
</P>
<P>
   Nelson's case, first filed with the Equal Employment Opportunity
Commission, was eventually transfered to federal court, and in
January, a U.S. district court judge entered a $1,325,000 million
judgement against Foster Wheeler.
</P>
<P>
   The judgment expanded the financial payment to include 100
former African-American and female employees in Foster Wheeler's
Chicago office whom the court found had been discriminated against.
</P>
<P>
   Foster Wheeler was also ordered to implement an anti-harassment
policy, provide anti-discrimination training to its work force and
make periodic reports to the EEOC regarding any racial or sexual
harassment complaints against the company.
</P>
<P>
   Margaret A. Burnham, a prominent Boston civil rights attorney
who represents Townsend, said her client initially filed a
complaint with the Massachusetts Commission Against Discrimination.
</P>
<P>
   But he withdrew the complaint and decided to sue the company
instead for the ``mental distress and emotional harm'' that he
suffered due to the alleged discriminatory practices.
</P>
<P>
   Townsend said he interpreted the noose as a threat that he would
suffer physical violence on the job if he decided to stay with the
company.
</P>
<P>
   ``These kinds of incidents are fairly widespread across the
country,'' said Burnham. ``This one was particularly egregious
because Terry was personally targeted. This was not just a generic
act.''
</P>
<P>
   Federal officials had warned the construction industry following
the Nelson trial that workplace discrimination would not be
tolerated.
</P>
<P>
   ``Racial and sexual harassment are particularly vicious forms of
discrimination _ as illegal at muddy construction sites as the
factory floor or in the carpeted office suite,'' said John C.
Henrickson, an EEOC attorney in Chicago.
</P>
<P>
   Wednesday a federal Labor Department spokesman said government
contracts can still be awarded to companies that have been found to
discriminate, but only if the infraction was a first-time or minor
offense.
</P>
<P>
   ``It really does amount to how gross the violation is and how
often it occurred,'' the spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
   But Townsend, who now works as a technical specialist for GZA
GeoEnvironmental Inc. of Newton, believes firms found by a court to
have practiced or condoned discrimination should be barred from
receiving government contracts.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think that the government has to be more cautious in the
hiring of contractors,'' he said. ``They should look not just at a
company's performance, but on their ethics as well.''

 &HT;    Who is the next Ted Williams?
 &HT;    By Joe Capozzi
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. _ About a year ago, Ted Williams sat down
to breakfast with some guests at his Hernando home. There were a
couple of New Hampshire state troopers who were longtime friends
and a few others, but the Hall of Famer didn't notice the slender
kid with the ballcap pulled close to his bird's-beak nose.
</P>
<P>
   Between bites of eggs and fruit, the baseball talk started
flowing. Someone asked Williams what he thought of the young
shortstop for the Boston Red Sox, Nomar Garciaparra.
</P>
<P>
   ``A great hitter. Graceful. Powerful,'' replied Williams, 81,
the last man to hit. 400. ``And if anyone can hit .400 again, it's
Garciaparra.''
</P>
<P>
   Across the table, Garciaparra flipped off his cap and grinned.
The table erupted in laughter. Good thing you complimented the kid,
someone joked.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hey, it's the truth,'' said Williams, who was 23 when he hit
.406 in 1941. ``If anyone can do it, this guy can do it.''
</P>
<P>
   Going into Saturday, Garciaparra, 27, was batting .398 with two
months left in the season. Plenty of hitters over the years have
had high averages in August only to see them fall to more human
levels come September.
</P>
<P>
   But in this era of Cartoon Baseball, many are wondering whether
the same elements that have altered the home-run records will lead
to the first .400 hitter in nearly 60 years _ and whether that
hitter just might be Garciaparra.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought a few years ago that Tony Gwynn was the only guy,''
said George Brett, who in 1980 made the most serious run in 39
years, batting .400 as late as Sept. 19 before finishing at .390.
</P>
<P>
   ``But the numbers are so inflated right now. You had Roger
Maris' (single-season home run) record stand for so long and now
guys are flying past it. Pretty soon somebody is going to get on a
hot streak. I definitely think someone else is going to do it. It's
going to happen, but it's going to be tough.''
</P>
<P>
   ADVANTAGE TO THE HITTERS
</P>
<P>
   It's going to be tough, all right. Hitters travel to different
time zones, see more than just one pitcher per game and face a
crush of media. But there are advantages that didn't exist in the
days of Ty Cobb and Teddy Ballgame: diluted pitching from expansion
and stronger, better-conditioned players _ benefiting from
advancements such as laser eye surgery, nutritional supplements and
year-round strength programs _ hitting with smaller strike zones in
smaller ballparks.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are a lot of good hitters out there,'' said pitcher
Randy Johnson of the Arizona Diamondbacks, ''but I don't know if
anyone will (hit .400 again). I think it might be more difficult
now because there are so many specialty pitchers coming out of the
bullpen. They get to face up to four different pitchers in a game,
all coming with different stuff.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, there are signs that the road to .400 may not be an
impossible journey. Darin Erstad, a left-handed hitter for the
Anaheim Angels, is on pace to break the single-season record for
hits (257 in 1920 by George Sisler, who hit .407 that year).
</P>
<P>
   And entering the All-Star break, 11 players _ six in the
National League and five in the American League _ were batting .350
or higher. Only twice in the past 10 seasons have as many as seven
players been hitting that high by the All-Star break, according to
the Elias Sports Bureau.
</P>
<P>
   Garciaparra's average stood at .389 at the break, followed by
Colorado's Todd Helton at .384. In 1993, John Olerud was hitting
.395 and Andres Galaragga .391 at the break. A year later, Larry
Walker was at .398.
</P>
<P>
   Still, only two players since 1941 have hit .400 into August _
Olerud in 1993 and Brett in 1980. And for Garciaparra to finish the
season at .400, he would have to at least match his best career
numbers for August (.372 in 1997) and September (.393 in 1999).
</P>
<P>
   ``Hitting .400 is probably the closest to impossible feat there
is,'' said Braves third baseman Chipper Jones, the reigning NL MVP.
``Some guys hit .400 for a month. That's a hot month. You stay hot
for six or seven months, that's unheard of. Guys just don't do
it.''
</P>
<P>
   GETTING BREAKS ESSENTIAL
</P>
<P>
   Wade Boggs did it. For a span of 162 games, he hit .404 _ from
May 1985 to May 1986. (Boggs finished 1985 at .368 and 1986 at
.357.) But Boggs, now retired and working in the Tampa Bay Devil
Rays' front office, and Williams are among those who do not
subscribe to the theory that the Power Ball-era elements will spike
batting averages.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think home runs and average are conducive to one
another. You can go one for five with a home run and hit 65 home
runs and not hit for average,'' Boggs said.
</P>
<P>
   ``In order for someone to hit .400, you have to enter September
hitting .420. And even then, the only way to hit .400 is to barely
qualify for the title, have the minimum number of at-bats or be
injured part of the season.''
</P>
<P>
   That's how Brett's season went in 1980, when he missed 45 games
because of injuries, includi Maris were saying they thought Brett
could hit .400.
</P>
<P>
   In that final month of 1980, Brett recalled, the pressure
finally got to him. He was hounded by reporters. The ball no longer
looked like a cantaloupe. Fielders seemed to rob him of hits with
great defensive plays.
</P>
<P>
   He went 4 for his next 27, dropping to .384, then went on to get
10 hits in his next 19 at-bats to finish with the highest average
since Williams in '41.
</P>
<P>
   ``Dealing with the media was tough,'' Brett recalled. ``Whoever
is going to do it, that last month of the season is going to be
hard to deal with. I'm still getting calls on (the 1980 season) 20
years later.''
</P>
<P>
   POWER VS. AVERAGE
</P>
<P>
   Then there's the question of whether players want to hit .400 _
and accept all of the baggage that comes with it. Garciaparra
refuses to talk about numbers and insists he doesn't pay attention
to where his average is.
</P>
<P>
   In the record-breaking home-run season of 1998, there was a
feeling players were more infatuated with power than for average.
``Big home-run hitters are being paid a lot of money,'' Mike
Hargrove, then managing the Cleveland Indians, told a reporter that
year, ``and I think a lot of people are concentrating on homers.''
</P>
<P>
   But even the skeptics agree that few offensive records, power or
average, are safe anymore. ``I never thought I'd see major-league
players hit .370 with 55 home runs and 160 RBI,'' Brett said.
``That just didn't happen when I played, and I've only been out of
the game since 1993.''
</P>
<P>
   Said Boggs, ``I don't think anybody can say 'never' about
anybody, not when you have Sammy Sosa hitting 60 home runs for two
years in a row and never leading the league. That's
mind-boggling.''
</P>
<P>
   Many agree that a left-handed hitter would have the best shot at
.400. Because most pitchers are right-handed, a left-handed hitter
more often than not has a better view of the pitch. However, these
same people think the right-handed Garciaparra is a hitter who
might have the intangibles to do it.
</P>
<P>
   ``Right now, it's unreal,'' Boston pitcher Pedro Martinez said
Friday after Garciaparra went 3-for-4 in Oakland. ``I've never seen
anybody _ never, ever _ any pitch, any count, you can whip it up
there and he can hit it. I just pray to God he stays healthy. I've
seen something very weird in Nomar's bat and he only seems to hit
the ball with the barrel of the bat.''
</P>
<P>
   Jones, whose Braves played the Red Sox this month, was impressed
at the way Garciaparra was able to hit breaking balls going away
from him.
</P>
<P>
   ``He keeps everything so simple,'' Jones said. ``He's got very
little movement. His mechanics are perfect. He's got a perfect
swing. He plays in a great ballpark where he can hit 290-foot
doubles all day. But he doesn't just try to do that. He'll take the
ball the other way. He's got some juice to all fields. He's very
quick to figure out what a pitcher's doing.''
</P>
<P>
   And that's why the last man to hit .400 says he thinks
Garciaparra will be the next.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nomar is going to do it. He's going to hit .400,'' Williams
said in a phone interview Saturday. ``I'm predicting that on the
record and I've been saying that for a while. He has the instinct
and the patience and the discipline, and the proof is in the
average.''

 &HT;    COMMENTARY: Dr. Laura on TV is just what her supporters deserve
 &HT;    By Tom Teepen
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   I suppose it behooves those of us who have often grumped against
the right-wing cultural warriors who harry the producers and
sponsors of art and entertainment they dislike to defend Dr. Laura
Schlessinger from the gay- and human-rights activists who are
ganging up on her and undermining a proposed TV show featuring her.
</P>
<P>
   Happily, speaking up for her does not require actually speaking
well of Schlessinger, who uses her radio call-in show to espouse a
biblical moral absolutism that might give even some of the sterner
prophets the willies.
</P>
<P>
   To the poor souls who have muddled their way into the richly
assorted messes all of us are capable of and have come to her for
aid and succor, Schlessinger's inevitable advice is: Tough. Serves
you right. Pull up your socks.
</P>
<P>
   This woman could curdle the milk of human kindness at 100 yards
and never break stride.
</P>
<P>
   She has been especially contemptuous of gays and lesbians and of
efforts to enact legal protections against anti-gay discrimination.
</P>
<P>
   Granting legal rights to homosexuals, she has said, would be the
same as enacting rights for bestiality and pedophilia. She has
dismissed gays and lesbians as ``a biological error.''
</P>
<P>
   That said, Schlessinger does not call for ostracizing, much less
hating and certainly not for hurting gays and lesbians. Her
attitudes no doubt reinforce folks already disposed toward
homophobia and gay-bashing, but they do so obliquely and in kind
with a myriad of other similar social negatives.
</P>
<P>
   Her offenses, though real and deserving vigorous rejoinder, do
not merit the media equivalent of capital punishment. They are,
after all and alas, the commonplace of many pulpits.
</P>
<P>
   The campaign to scuttle Paramount's planned program has so far
cost the project and Schlessinger's radio show such sponsors as
Procter &AMP; Gamble, Toys ``R'' Us, United Air Lines, Kraft, General
Foods and more.
</P>
<P>
   The mission is the flip side of the boycotting tear that
televangelists and others professional indignants of the right were
on through the '90s.
</P>
<P>
   Disney's `` Pocahontas'' was boycotted by the Southern Baptists
for showing ``earth-worshipping paganism.'' Disney was boycotted,
too, for making movies for grown-ups that the right disliked and
for extending benefits to the partners of gay and lesbian
employees.
</P>
<P>
   Donald Wildmon's Mississippi-based American Family Association
boycotted Calvin Klein because of its underwear ads, K-mart because
its Waldenbooks subsidiary carried books and magazines Wildmon
disapproved of, Mennen and Clorox for sponsoring ``Miami Vice'' and
``Knot's Landing,'' the many sponsors of ``Murphy Brown.''
And...well, there were many more, but that's enough.
</P>
<P>
   Commercial TV and its sponsors are jumpy enough as it is without
being driven to even greater excesses of timidity by boycotters
trying to boss the medium into their various versions of
righteousness.
</P>
<P>
   If enough viewers to make the deal feasible want to watch
Schlessinger on TV, let them. It would serve them right.

GOP MESSAGE TARGETS WOMEN VOTERS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MARY LEONARD  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHILADELPHIA _ The middle initial in George W. Bush's name used
to stand for Walker. This week, it stands for Women.
</P>
<P>
   Across the floor of the Republican National Convention,
delegates wave posters and sport buttons that say ``W is for
Women.'' But those visual aids aren't really necessary, because
almost everything about the 2000 GOP gathering _ the women
speakers, the videos filled with children, the compassionate themes
repeated again and again at the podium _ is aimed at female voters.
</P>
<P>
   It is a huge contrast to past GOP conventions, when Republicans
let the angry rhetoric of cultural warriors, pro-gun militants,
defense hawks, and abortion opponents set the party's tone. It
scared off many women, pollsters said, and helped create the gender
gap that elected Bill Clinton in 1992 and 1996.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a new Republican Party,'' Celinda Lake, a Democratic
pollster who studies gender voting, said here this week. ``There
has never been a Republican leader who understands the targeting of
women the way George W. Bush does. If anybody can capture the
women's vote, he can.''
</P>
<P>
   Lake's latest poll shows Bush and Democrat Al Gore in a
statistical dead heat among women voters. With Bush 16 points ahead
among male voters in the same poll, the wooing of women has become
the central mission of both presidential campaigns.
</P>
<P>
   The Republican convention is a big national showcase for Bush,
and he is not missing an opportunity on any of its four nights to
demonstrate he is both an advocate for women's concerns, from
education to health care to Social Security, and a man at ease with
strong, smart women.
</P>
<P>
   It was a calculated move by the campaign to have Laura Bush, a
former librarian and elementary-school teacher, tout her commitment
to early-childhood education during a warm testimonial to her
husband on the convention's opening night. Tuesday night, it was
Barbara Bush _ not the former president _ who introduced their son
and welcomed the conventioneers to Philadelphia, which Mrs. Bush
quipped was ``the city of motherly love.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush's main purpose, in remarks beamed in by satellite from
Gettysburg, Pa., was to set the stage for two more accomplished,
prime-time convention speakers: Condoleezza Rice, who Bush
described as ``a brilliant woman and my chief foreign-policy
adviser,'' and Elizabeth Dole, the two-time Cabinet secretary who
Bush said was a ``a pioneer and a role model for so many of our
daughters.''
</P>
<P>
   Dole made sure her national-security speech touched women when
she said, ``Freedom empowers the heart. It levels walls and
shatters ceilings, including glass ceilings.''
</P>
<P>
   Wednesday night, two single mothers, a female farmer, and a
30-year-old woman who is a successful high-tech entrepreneur joined
what has been a weeklong cavalcade of women speakers extolling the
Republican Party's positive, caring public policies. On stage, the
most visible members of the unpopular GOP Congress have been the
convention co-chairs, Representatives Jennifer Dunn, a moderate
from Washington state, and J.C. Watts of Oklahoma, a black man.
</P>
<P>
   The scowling House leadership _ Representatives Dick Armey and
Tom DeLay of Texas _ are nowhere to be seen, and the GOP's expected
biting, partisan attacks on the Democrats and the Clintons have not
been heard.
</P>
<P>
   ``When women look at George Bush and Dick Cheney, they don't see
a harsh conservative, which has been the face of the Republican
Congress,'' said Linda DiVall, a Republican pollster and
strategist. ``They see the face of conservatism that is much more
optimistic and, quite frankly, one that will not dismantle
government programs at every stage and every opportunity.''
</P>
<P>
   The convention message and messengers are very much in sync with
what pollsters know about women voters: They like civil politics,
moral leadership, and effective government. They worry most about
the economic and physical security of their families, educational
opportunities for their children, and the pressures of juggling
tasks at work and home.
</P>
<P>
   Kathleen Hall Jamieson, a political analyst at the Annenberg
Center for Public Policy at the University of Pennsylvania, said
the convention's theme, ``Renewing America's Purpose. Together,''
sends a strong signal to moderate women voters that the GOP is
inclusive and concerned about children and families.
</P>
<P>
   ``The theme is symbolically consistent and very well executed,''
Jamieson said.
</P>
<P>
   But is it sincere? Marie Wilson, who heads the White House
Project, a nonprofit group trying to promote women for high
elective offices, said she fears women have become ``vote objects''
for the major political parties.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am concerned that both parties are looking at women as vote
objects rather than real partners in democracy and governing,''
Wilson said. ``We are not just constituents. We are not just people
to be made to feel better.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, Republican women who support gun control, federal
family-planning programs, and abortion rights say the party
platform crafted by Bush and approved by the convention Monday does
not reflect the image of a kinder, gentler GOP. Some say Bush has
not reassured women with his running mate choice of Cheney, who as
a congressman voted against the Equal Rights Amendment, the Clean
Water Act, and federal funds for the Head Start program.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the choices George W. Bush is making, he is showing us what
he believes and what is important,'' said Doris Wilson of
Washington, a Republican vice president of the National Women's
Political Caucus. ``And women aren't really important.''
</P>
<P>
   Women delegates, many who have been working in the GOP for many
years, insist there is something new afoot _ a tone, an attitude,
certainly a unity that is driven by an overwhelming desire to find
a way to win in November.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is better than it has ever been for women, and it is not
just words and rhetoric,'' said Sue Anne Gilroy, Indiana's
Republican secretary of state. ``There is a true, genuine, and
substantive effort to change the party's direction and put together
a coalition that can win.''
</P>
<P>
   This marks the fourth convention that June Hartley, Oregon's
national GOP committeewoman, has attended, and none has been as
upbeat and positive as this one, she said. She likes Bush's
integrity and experience, and she isn't concerned that as a woman,
she disagrees with some of his stands.
</P>
<P>
   ``My mother always said, `if a man agrees with you 100 percent
of the time, he is either henpecked or not very smart,'' Mrs.
Hartley said.

RIGHTIST SHOCKS CANADIANS BY FLIRTING WITH SEPARATISTS 
</HEADLINE>
   By JAMES BROOKE    
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   MONTREAL _ Stockwell Day's summer vacation in Quebec was going
well. Day, the rising star of Canada's right, appeared daily on
French-language television, chatting in Francais with his
language-immersion teachers, fielding reporters' questions about
his politique fiscale, or posing for photographs with the eternal
friend of language students, le dictionnaire Larousse.
</P>
<P>
   Then the athletic Day, a former treasurer from Alberta, clumsily
stepped on a classic Quebec land mine.
</P>
<P>
   With newspapers reporting ``informal negotiations'' between his
party, the Canadian Alliance, and the Bloc Quebecois, whose stated
goal is to make Quebec an independent nation, Day refused to rule
out teaming up with the Bloc in a coalition after general
elections, expected next spring, in order to dislodge the governing
Liberals.
</P>
<P>
   ``An unholy alliance with people who don't believe in the
country,'' fumed Allan Rock, Canada's health minister and an
aspirant for leadership of the Liberals.
</P>
<P>
   Undeterred by Day's hurried disavowal of any electoral alliance,
Stephane Dion, the leader of the Liberal government's unity drive,
said, ``It's playing with Canada, and you don't play with your
country.''
</P>
<P>
   As Canada continues to be haunted by the lingering separatist
threat, the sharpest rebukes came from some of Day's closest
backers.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Canadian Alliance leader needs to stop playing footsie
with Quebec separatist leaders right now,'' thundered the editorial
page of the National Post, which has usually been a star-struck
cheerleader for Day.
</P>
<P>
   In an interview on Tuesday, Conrad Black, chairman of the
National Post, said the strategy would not work. ``It makes it too
easy for the Liberals to represent him as a separatist fellow
traveler, ambiguous about the future of the country.''
</P>
<P>
   The misstep comes as Day's party, the Alliance Canadienne, as it
is called here, starts to expand beyond its western roots, becoming
Canada's dominant conservative party. In an Angus Reid poll
released last weekend, the Alliance had more than doubled its
support since March, winning 24 percent of the voters polled, the
highest for any opposition party in almost five years. The poll
also indicated that the Alliance is now the most popular opposition
party from the Pacific Coast to the Ontario-Quebec border.
</P>
<P>
   In Quebec, Canada's second most-populous province, the poll
indicated that in two months, voter preference for the Alliance had
risen from 1 percent to 8 percent. In this socially liberal
province, Day has avoided talking about his opposition to abortion,
gay rights and gun control. Instead, he has focused on issues dear
to Quebec's voters, like cutting taxes, reducing parole for
criminals and deporting illegal immigrants.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, Day, long an advocate of decentralism, has pitched
his anti-Ottawa message to Quebec's ``soft nationalists'' _ the
one-third of voters here who want more autonomy, but not outright
independence. He advocates, for for instance, giving provinces
control over the tax money they raise for health, education and
social welfare.
</P>
<P>
   In particular, his tax-cutting ideas (Day advocates a flat tax)
seem to be translating well here, winning favorable editorials from
the Montreal daily La Presse and the business weekly Les Affaires.
</P>
<P>
   Overlooked in the flurry of denials and cartoons about games of
``footsie,'' Michel Gauthier, leader of the separatists, denounced
Day as a vote poacher. Gauthier warned his followers about the
perils of a summer romance with this handsome language student,
saying Day was ``trying to seduce Quebec voters.''

<TEXT>
<P>
   PHILADELPHIA _ Former President Gerald Ford suffered a minor
stroke Wednesday morning, hours after being honored at the
Republican National Convention.
</P>
<P>
   He was expected to make a full recovery, said doctors at
Hahnemann University Hospital, where the former president was in
the intensive care unit.
</P>
<P>
   Ford, 87, first went to the hospital at about midnight Tuesday,
after leaving the convention, where he had been honored in an
emotional tribute. He complained of pain on the right side of his
face and was diagnosed with a sinus infection, given antibiotics
and released. Hours later, he returned with additional symptoms.
</P>
<P>
   At a news conference Wednesday evening, hospital officials
defended the decision to discharge Ford and dismissed questions
about whether doctors missed symptoms of a stroke.
</P>
<P>
   ``The care that was given at that time was appropriate to the
symptoms he had,'' said Dr. Stephen Klasko, the hospital's clinical
dean. ``It's very unfair to the physicians and president Ford's
family to dissect the medical record.''
</P>
<P>
   Ford returned to the hospital at 9 a.m. Wednesday &UR; , &LR;  and doctors
determined he had suffered a small stroke in the lower part of the
brain, where unconscious actions like swallowing and balance are
controlled. Wednesday he suffered weakness in his left arm, balance
problems and slurred speech.
</P>
<P>
   But the former president should have no permanent neurological
damage, said Dr. Robert J. Schwartzman, head of neurology at the
hospital. ``The president should totally recover,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Ford was being treated with anti-coagulant drugs to reduce
clotting, the doctor said, and he was expected to be in the
hospital five to six days.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was very calm and collected about it and he was cooperative
in his care,'' Schwartzman said.
</P>
<P>
   Calvin McDowell, a spokesman for Ford, said former first last
Betty Ford was staying in the room next to her husband's. He said
Gov. George W. Bush had requested permission to visit, but was
refused along with others who had attempted to visit or call,
because the former president needed rest.
</P>
<P>
   ``He is able to take calls, but we are trying to insist he get
some rest,'' McDowell said. ``We are not in a position for anyone
to interrupt his rest.''
</P>
<P>
   Ford first went to the hospital around midnight Tuesday and was
treated for a sinus infection. McDowell had said a wax build-up had
led to the infection.
</P>
<P>
   Ford left the hospital at 1:36 a.m., but asked to be taken back
hours later after complaining of feeling ``uncomfortable, McDowell
said. ``We just thought we had a routine sinus infection, but then
he had other problems and he was brought back,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Ford appeared frail as he sat in a VIP box at the back of the
First Union Center on Tuesday night along with his wife, former
President George Bush, former first lady Barbara Bush and other
prominent Republicans. He was visibly moved when a video-taped
tribute to him was displayed on the large screens inside the hall.
</P>
<P>
   ``When uncertainty troubled our nation, President Gerald Ford
renewed America's confidence,'' Gov. George Pataki of New York
said, introducing the tribute. ``His strength, his strength and
integrity defended our values at home in an ever-changing world.''
</P>
<P>
   The crowd cheered when Pataki invoked ``President Ford's steady
leadership and Mrs. Ford's gentle grace.''
</P>
<P>
   He rose and waved to acknowledge the cheers of the audience.
</P>
<P>
   Ford did not address the convention, and told C-Span that this
would be the last convention he and his wife would attend, calling
it a ``concluding appearance to indicate our support.''

CONVENTION'S LACK OF CONTENTION TESTS PUNDITS 
</HEADLINE>

 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   About halfway into the Republican convention, news-starved
journalists began venting their frustration with the carefully
scripted lovefest.
</P>
<P>
   ``How long can this convention go on with its happy face?''
asked CNN senior analyst William Schneider Tuesday afternoon, his
voice rising. ``Will hotter heads prevail?''
</P>
<P>
   His colleague Jeff Greenfield echoed the point, wondering if
Republicans were actually making a political mistake ``by erasing
any known conflict from this convention.''
</P>
<P>
   If the modern convention is what MSNBC executive producer Steve
Capus calls a televised ``press release,'' the key to Philadelphia
is whether Republicans are successfully projecting a portrait of
inclusion and compassion or whether the event strikes independent
viewers and voters as tinny and contrived.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are putting a different face on the Republican Party,''
House Speaker Dennis Hastert told CNN. And from the prime-time
addresses of African-Americans Colin Powell and Condoleezza Rice to
the rainbow coalition of children that surrounded Laura Bush to the
rocking gospel group, the Republicans provided the TV audience with
a steady diet of ethnically and racially diverse players.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, the apparent dichotomy between those images
and the party faithful became a story line for the pundits to gnaw
on.
</P>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR; Bluntly expressing what other commentators cautiously alluded
to, ``Politically Incorrect'' host Bill Maher told CNN that the
convention ``looked like an NBA game to me. The entire audience was
white, but everyone on the stage was black.''
</P>
<P>
   On Tuesday night, Senator John McCain delivered a crucial unity
speech in which he embraced former rival George W. Bush as a man
``who wants to lead a Republican Party that is as big as the
country we serve.'' Tellingly, several members of a focus group
interviewed on MSNBC afterward said the fiery Arizona reformer's
remarks seemed strangely dispassionate, with one man lamenting that
``he didn't have the fire in his belly I've seen in the past.''
</P>
<P>
   At least that focus group was watching. This is the convention
season that the broadcast networks have written off as too boring
and predictable to warrant major coverage. (Surprises were so few
and far between that word of President Gerald Ford's stroke
Wednesday sent the cable networks feverishly scurrying for medical
experts and condition updates, their reporters seemingly relieved
to be working on a real story.)
</P>
<P>
   On opening night, NBC skipped the proceedings to air a rerun of
``Third Watch'' and only ABC made the commitment to show at least
an hour of prime-time activities each night. That didn't keep Peter
Jennings and his crew from signing off, however, before Powell even
finished his Monday address, arguably the convention highlight.
</P>
<P>
   Still, Jennings may have offered the most salient commentary
when he noted that ``Republicans are behaving a bit like
Democrats.'' It was Powell's speech, in which he scolded delegates
for opposing affirmative action and talked about social spending,
and was still cheered, that convinced commentators that they were
seeing a new kind of Republican convention.
</P>
<P>
   ``No boos, no catcalls,'' from the delegates for those liberal
positions, noted CBS's Ed Bradley. Greenfield marveled that Powell
``used two words you almost never hear at a Republican convention _
`spend more.' ''
</P>
<P>
   With the delegates determined not to go public with any of their
differences, journalists searched high and low for faint signs of
trouble.
</P>
<P>
   CNN correspondent John King managed to root out three
disgruntled conservatives in the Oklahoma delegation who complained
about Bush's too-squishy position on abortion and the fact that the
abolition of the Department of Education was no longer a priority.
And in what passed for high drama, the cable cameras focused on the
Texas delegation, where some delegates offered up a silent prayer
to protest a short Tuesday night speech on trade by openly gay
congessman Jim Kolbe.
</P>
<P>
   ``That was the probably the most contention we've seen in the
convention so far,'' said Fox News anchor Paula Zahn. ``Wasn't
much,'' retorted her partner, Brit Hume, speaking for many of his
media colleagues.
</P>
<P>
   When Jennings played provocateur by asking former House Speaker
Newt Gingrich _ a symbol of the strident conservatism noticeably
absent at the convention _ whether the party was looking ``to run
away from you and the congressional delegation,'' Gingrich dodged
the question like the young Muhammad Ali used to slip punches. With
even its most combustible entities sticking to the script and
frustrating the media, the Republicans were looking to project
likability. The issue is whether they strained credibility.
</P>
<P>
   After McCain's crucial speech, CBS anchor Dan Rather was among
those to notice that he had not even mentioned the subject nearest
and dearest to his heart _ campaign finance reform. As she worked
the convention floor, ABC's Michel Martin took note of the
ideological differences between the convention speakers and party
platform and said, ``It's not clear at the moment which point of
view is going to be carried into the fall.''
</P>
<P>
   For now, the point of view that dominated TV was that of a party
so set on avoiding images of conflict that ABC commentator George
Stephanopoulos reported he couldn't even find an Al Gore-bashing
button among the delegates.
</P>
<P>
   Reflecting on all this public sweetness and light, CNN anchor
Bernard Shaw wondered about ``the sanitizing of political rhetoric.
. . . Is this a little too slick?''
</P>
<P>
   The answer may not reveal itself until November.

<P>
   A morose teen-age girl spies on a couple of lovers in the park,
and when her attention returns to what she's supposed to be doing,
the little girl she was baby-sitting has vanished. A second-rate
baker wonders about the sincerity of her non-English-speaking
Italian lover. A gay housecleaner _ who believes that love has a
scent _ meets with a catalog of former lovers, trying to determine
what went wrong with each affair. An eye doctor who is going deaf
makes a list of the sounds he wants to hear and preserve in his
mind. And a masseuse yearns to find a way to touch the heart of her
morose teen-age daughter. Yes, the same one who lost the little
girl.
</P>
<P>
   Such is the structure of ``The Five Senses,'' writer-director
Jeremy Podeswa's low-key study of alienation, connection and, well,
taste, touch, hearing, sight and smell. It's a movie that resembles
``Magnolia'' in its characterization of lonely people, yet if
``Magnolia'' erred by turning up the volume too high, ``The Five
Senses'' errs by keeping it too steady _ and by wearing its senses
on its sleeve. The self-conscious device of having characters
represent senses gets in the way of the stories, which play out
coolly even in their moments of anger.
</P>
<P>
   The cast _ the most familiar name is Mary-Louise Parker,
probably best-known for 1991's ``Grand Canyon'' _ acquits itself
well, but the characters are so moody that they flirt with becoming
tiresome. As the nosy housecleaner, Daniel MacIvor comes close to
stealing the film because his character has the best sense of
humor.
</P>
<P>
   Podeswa's ambition is admirable, but he needn't have been so
obvious about the sensory aspects. He needs to take a cue from
movies like Iran's ``Color of Paradise,'' which seamlessly blends
its sights and sounds into its story simply because it puts the
story first. That made it engrossing; ``The Five Senses'' is merely
interesting, and isn't always successful at reaching even that
level of involvement. &QL;

CONVENTION'S LACK OF CONTENTION TESTS PUNDITS 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (p and e coding)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)

 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   About halfway into the Republican convention, news-starved
journalists began venting their frustration with the carefully
scripted lovefest.
</P>
<P>
   ``How long can this convention go on with its happy face?''
asked CNN senior analyst William Schneider Tuesday afternoon, his
voice rising. ``Will hotter heads prevail?''
</P>
<P>
   His colleague Jeff Greenfield echoed the point, wondering if
Republicans were actually making a political mistake ``by erasing
any known conflict from this convention.''
</P>
<P>
   If the modern convention is what MSNBC executive producer Steve
Capus calls a televised ``press release,'' the key to Philadelphia
is whether Republicans are successfully projecting a portrait of
inclusion and compassion or whether the event strikes independent
viewers and voters as tinny and contrived.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are putting a different face on the Republican Party,''
House Speaker Dennis Hastert told CNN. And from the prime-time
addresses of African-Americans Colin Powell and Condoleezza Rice to
the rainbow coalition of children that surrounded Laura Bush to the
rocking gospel group, the Republicans provided the TV audience with
a steady diet of ethnically and racially diverse players.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, the apparent dichotomy between those images
and the party faithful became a story line for the pundits to gnaw
on.
</P>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR; Bluntly expressing what other commentators cautiously alluded
to, ``Politically Incorrect'' host Bill Maher told CNN that the
convention ``looked like an NBA game to me. The entire audience was
white, but everyone on the stage was black.''
</P>
<P>
   On Tuesday night, Senator John McCain delivered a crucial unity
speech in which he embraced former rival George W. Bush as a man
``who wants to lead a Republican Party that is as big as the
country we serve.'' Tellingly, several members of a focus group
interviewed on MSNBC afterward said the fiery Arizona reformer's
remarks seemed strangely dispassionate, with one man lamenting that
``he didn't have the fire in his belly I've seen in the past.''
</P>
<P>
   At least that focus group was watching. This is the convention
season that the broadcast networks have written off as too boring
and predictable to warrant major coverage. (Surprises were so few
and far between that word of President Gerald Ford's stroke
Wednesday sent the cable networks feverishly scurrying for medical
experts and condition updates, their reporters seemingly relieved
to be working on a real story.)
</P>
<P>
   On opening night, NBC skipped the proceedings to air a rerun of
``Third Watch'' and only ABC made the commitment to show at least
an hour of prime-time activities each night. That didn't keep Peter
Jennings and his crew from signing off, however, before Powell even

&HT;     SAN FRANCISCO'S DOT-COMMERCE CONTINUES TO THRIVE 
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 &HT;     By ALAN T. SARACEVIC  
 &HT;     c.2000 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ San Francisco's dot-commerce has grown nearly
500 percent in the past five years, generating nearly $5.7 billion
in revenue last year, according to a recent study.
</P>
<P>
   ``This survey shows me San Francisco's digital industry is
strong, it's a major player, and it's good for the city,'' said
Marie Jones, director of economic development for the San Francisco
Partnership, the nonprofit economic development agency that
conducted the survey.
</P>
<P>
   According to Jones and the San Francisco Partnership, the
digital industry includes software developers, Web site developers,
digital content developers, Web site portals and e-commerce firms,
including B2C (business to commerce) and B2B (business to
business).
</P>
<P>
   For the purpose of the survey, the community did not include
Internet workers at established, global companies such as Charles
Schwab and Gap.
</P>
<P>
   Besides its sheer size, San Francisco's digital economy proved
to be surprisingly profitable and diverse.
</P>
<P>
   On the subject of revenues, 51 percent of digital firms in The
City are profitable today, the survey said, dispelling the myth
that most dot-com firms were running out of money.
</P>
<P>
   ``And a lot of that revenue is sales to business, so it's not
the squishy side of the industry,'' said Jones.
</P>
<P>
   The report also suggested that 24 percent of digital industry
employees were minorities, although 20 percent of the work force
had no college
</P>
<P>
   degree.
</P>
<P>
   ``The challenges the firms are facing are recruiting and
retaining employees,`` said Jones. ``Over 45 percent of the
surveyed firms said that was their biggest challenge.''
</P>
<P>
   That pressure on the work force manifests itself in local
salaries, said Jones, whose survey showed that compensation for
upper management, systems administrators and graphic designers in
the digital industry was more than 30 percent higher in San
Francisco than elsewhere in the nation.
</P>
<P>
   For example, the average upper management salary in the city is
$151,769, a 77 percent premium on the national average.
</P>
<P>
   And if you're not making it in salary, stock options are the
next best thing. According to the survey, 88 percent of all the
digital industry employees in San Francisco receive stock options
as a benefit of employment, as opposed to a third nationwide.
</P>
<P>
   Not only do our local dot-coms have to pay more for their
talent, the space they rent goes for a premium. The typical digital
industry firm pays $32 per square foot per month and occupies more
than 10,000 square feet of space. Coupled with low vacancy, those
high rents are the biggest disadvantage facing the city's
dot-commers, the survey said.

CONSTRUCTION FIRM NAMED IN NEW BIAS SUIT 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (a and f coding)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JAMAL E. WATSON  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ An international construction firm recently ordered to
pay $1.3 million to settle racial discrimination and sexual
harassment claims has been accused by a Bay State man of of racism
while he worked for the company at a government construction site.
</P>
<P>
   Terrence A. Townsend, 36, who is black, alleges in a civil
lawsuit that while working for Foster Wheeler's Boston office he
was repeatedly subjected to racial slurs and had to use portable
toilets defaced with KKK graffiti.
</P>
<P>
   After Townsend complained to managers, his attorney says a white
co-workers handed him a hangman's noose and allegedly told him,
``The noose is for you in case you get out of hand.''
</P>
<P>
   Between 1995 and 1997, while monitoring air quality for Foster
Wheeler at an Environmental Protection Agency construction project
in Stratford, Conn., Townsend said he endured a hostile racial
climate that his superiors refused to do anything about.
</P>
<P>
   He also said that he and other black employees were repeatedly
given heavier workloads, more undesirable assignments, and paid far
less than their white counterparts.
</P>
<P>
   Townsend, who quit Foster Wheeler two years ago and now works
for another construction company, outlined his allegations in the
suit filed in Suffolk Superior Court. A trial is expected to begin
next month.
</P>
<P>
   ``Working at the site really put a lot of stress on me,'' said
Townsend, of suburban Canton, Mass. ``It's hard to believe that
this kind of discrimination still happens, especially on a
government contracted site.''
</P>
<P>
   Alastair Davie, a spokesman for Foster Wheeler, which is based
in New Jersey and employs 10,000 workers worldwide, refused comment
on Townsend's suit and would not discuss the company's policy on
workplace discrimination.
</P>
<P>
   A spokesperson at the EPA, which provided the contract to Foster
Wheeler for the Conneticut project, did not return several phone
calls.
</P>
<P>
   Four years ago, Darryl Nelson, a black man working in Foster
Wheeler's Chicago office, accused the company of fostering a
racially hostile environment for minority workers.
</P>
<P>
   Nelson's case, first filed with the Equal Employment Opportunity
Commission, was eventually transfered to federal court, and in
January, a U.S. district court judge entered a $1,325,000 million
judgement against Foster Wheeler.
</P>
<P>
   The judgment expanded the financial payment to include 100
former African-American and female employees in Foster Wheeler's
Chicago office whom the court found had been discriminated against.
</P>
<P>
   Foster Wheeler was also ordered to implement an anti-harassment
policy, provide anti-discrimination training to its work force and
make periodic reports to the EEOC regarding any racial or sexual
harassment complaints against the company.
</P>
<P>
   Margaret A. Burnham, a prominent Boston civil rights attorney
who represents Townsend, said her client initially filed a
complaint with the Massachusetts Commission Against Discrimination.
</P>
<P>
   But he withdrew the complaint and decided to sue the company
instead for the ``mental distress and emotional harm'' that he
suffered due to the alleged discriminatory practices.
</P>
<P>
   Townsend said he interpreted the noose as a threat that he would
suffer physical violence on the job if he decided to stay with the
company.
</P>
<P>
   ``These kinds of incidents are fairly widespread across the
country,'' said Burnham. ``This one was particularly egregious
because Terry was personally targeted. This was not just a generic
act.''
</P>
<P>
   Federal officials had warned the construction industry following
the Nelson trial that workplace discrimination would not be
tolerated.
</P>
<P>
   ``Racial and sexual harassment are particularly vicious forms of
discrimination _ as illegal at muddy construction sites as the
factory floor or in the carpeted office suite,'' said John C.
Henrickson, an EEOC attorney in Chicago.
</P>
<P>
   Wednesday a federal Labor Department spokesman said government
contracts can still be awarded to companies that have been found to
discriminate, but only if the infraction was a first-time or minor
offense.
</P>
<P>
   ``It really does amount to how gross the violation is and how
often it occurred,'' the spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
   But Townsend, who now works as a technical specialist for GZA
GeoEnvironmental Inc. of Newton, believes firms found by a court to
have practiced or condoned discrimination should be barred from
receiving government contracts.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think that the government has to be more cautious in the
hiring of contractors,'' he said. ``They should look not just at a
company's performance, but on their ethics as well.''

FORMER PRIME MINISTER FACES INQUIRY

<TEXT>
<P>
   DUBLIN _ Each weekday morning, he is chauffeured in a pale blue
Mercedes to Dublin Castle. It would seem a fitting mode of travel
for a former prime minister of Ireland, a man of regal bearing
whose very face, with those hooded eyelids and that dramatic sweep
of silvery hair, is as identifiable in this country as the castle
itself.
</P>
<P>
   But Charles J. Haughey comes to discuss the state of his
financial affairs rather than affairs of state _ from the witness
stand, at a tribunal that is exploring the relationship between
this once-dominant political figure and various businessmen who,
over the years, handed him and his subordinates hundreds of
thousands of dollars in checks and cash.
</P>
<P>
   The tribunal has estimated that Haughey (pronounced HAW-hee)
received as much as $10 million in contributions to cover his huge
debts and expensive tastes, and it is poring over his personal
banking records to determine whether he used his public office to
benefit his benefactors. Haughey and his lawyers have not yet
addressed the central thrust of the inquiry, but they are expected
to maintain that he did nothing untoward for the money, which they
will argue totaled no more than $7.5 million.
</P>
<P>
   The seamiest allegations center on a fund that Haughey
established in 1989 to send his political ally and close friend,
Brian Lenihan, who has since died, to the United States for a liver
transplant. About $100,000 from the fund covered the transplant and
related costs, but the whereabouts of at least another $125,000 is
unclear _ although there is evidence that some was spent on
Haughey's personal expenses.
</P>
<P>
   The tribunal will ultimately present a report to Parliament that
probably will join other efforts to tighten relatively new public
ethics laws. Michael Moran, a government spokesman, said that
revelations regarding Haughey and other politicians have already
contributed to legislation seeking further reform.
</P>
<P>
   In the meantime, the daily proceedings of the tribunal, which
began a summer recess on July 28 and will reconvene in September,
feed a growing list of allegations of public corruption.
</P>
<P>
   There are nine sitting tribunals and 11 other inquiries,
investigating everything from the contamination of blood products
to decades-old allegations of child abuse in public institutions.
</P>
<P>
   But the most prominent investigation centers on off-shore bank
accounts, cozy public-private relationships and blurred lines
between political donations and personal gifts _ all of which lead
inexorably back to this 74-year-old man twirling his gold-rimmed
glasses as he ponders embarrassing questions posed in public.
</P>
<P>
   ``He is a Nixon figure in Irish public life,'' said Dermot
Keogh, an author and professor of Irish history at National
University of Ireland in Cork. ``He is a flawed talent.''
</P>
<P>
   An accountant from Dublin and the son-in-law of former Prime
Minister Sean Lemass, Haughey rose quickly within the dominant
political party, Fianna Fail (FEE-na FALL) to serve in various
ministerial capacities in the 1960s. He is credited with several
progressive measures, from ensuring that widows and children were
included in estate matters to providing free electricity and public
transportation to the elderly.
</P>
<P>
   He spent several years in political isolation _ charged with,
and then acquitted of, conspiring to import guns to be used in
Northern Ireland. In 1979 he returned, gaining control of Fianna
Fail and emerging as prime minister, a position he held, on and
off, for nine years. He was both blamed and praised for economic
ebbs and flows and is generally credited with jump-starting the
Northern Ireland peace efforts.
</P>
<P>
   Throughout, the matter of his wealth vexed and amused the
nation. Haughey earned a modest salary as a member of the
Parliament, yet lived on a Dublin estate, owned a small island off
the southern coast, and relaxed on a yacht called the ``Celtic
Mist.''
</P>
<P>
   By 1992, various controversies had become too much for even
Haughey's allies to countenance, and he was forced to step down as
prime minister. With characteristic flourish, he said farewell to
public life with a quote from ``Othello'': ``I have done the state
some service, they know't; no more of that.''
</P>
<P>
   But just as Haughey was settling in as elder statesman, the
Dunne family, owners of the country's largest department-store
chain, became concerned with the spending habits of the company's
chief executive, Ben Dunne. Inquiries led to the discovery that
over the years Dunne had given Haughey a sum now estimated at $2.5
million.
</P>
<P>
   At first Haughey told an investigating tribunal in 1997 that he
knew nothing of the matter and that a close adviser had handled his
financial affairs to free him ``to devote my time and ability to
public life.'' But the accumulated evidence forced Haughey to
concede that he had misled the tribunal.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Dunne's testimony of an incident in 1991 was particularly
damaging. He said he visited the prime minister and found him
looking depressed. To cheer the leader up, he said, he handed him
checks totaling $260,000. His recollection of Haughey's response
has since entered national lore: ``Thank you, big fella.''
</P>
<P>
   Although the tribunal found no evidence that Haughey had
assisted Dunne in exchange for the gifts, it expressed great doubt
about the former leader's testimony. ``It is quite unacceptable,''
the tribunal said in its final report, for an elected official _
particularly a prime minister _ to be ``supported in his personal
lifestyle by gifts made to him personally.''
</P>
<P>
   A criminal charge of obstruction was lodged against Haughey, and
he was forced to pay more than $1 million in back taxes and
penalties.
</P>
<P>
   Now another panel is digging deeper into his murky finances to
determine whether the showers of money influenced the performance
of his public duties.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   And so, for the last 18 months, some of Ireland's best-known
public figures _ from multimillionaire businessmen to Bertie Ahern,
a former Haughey lieutenant and current prime minister _ have made
their way up the cobblestone path to Dublin Castle to share their
tantalizing pieces of the puzzle.
</P>
<P>
   Even the Haughey faithful have found the revelations unsettling.
Testimony has shown that when he was elected prime minister in late
1979, Haughey and his aides spread the word that he needed money,
fast: he owed more than $1.3 million to Allied Irish Bank. Within
weeks, he was able to give more than $930,000 to the bank, which
charged off most of what was still owed.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   A property developer, in typical testimony, testified that he
contributed $475,000 to the cause after being summoned by the prime
minister to his estate. Another developer testified that in 1989 he
handed Haughey four checks for about $31,000 each _ one for the
Lenihan transplant fund and the three others for Fianna Fail. But
according to the tribunal, the party only received a portion of the
money, and none of it was deposited in the transplant fund.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, testimony has shown that contributions to the Lenihan
fund went into a so-called leader's account that Haughey used for
such personal needs as tailor-made shirts from Paris and dinners at
an exclusive French restaurant in Dublin. Evidence that Lenihan's
medical costs were fully covered has not created a groundswell of
support for Haughey, no more than have reports that he has prostate
cancer.
</P>
<P>
   Professor Keogh, who has written several books on modern
Ireland, said the revelations of the tribunal demonstrate the
extent to which Haughey and his allies corrupted the values of a
government founded a generation earlier by people who believed in a
``communitarian democracy.'' The country needed to be modernized,
he said, ``but he did it in a way that weakened and undermined the
state of governance, and the citizens' confidence in the
government.''
</P>
<P>
   Ryle Dwyer, a historian who has written several books about
Haughey, said, though, that Haughey is not the first leader to
believe that he should focus on public affairs while others tend to
his finances. Dwyer also said that, given the many other cases of
political scandal, Haughey's indiscretions are more symptomatic
than causal _ and that Irish politicians have long had the power to
enact reform.
</P>
<P>
   ``If he has done wrong he should be nailed and, I rightly feel,
jailed,'' Dwyer said. ``I just don't like the hypocrisy.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   As others contemplate his legacy, Haughey comes daily to Dublin
Castle and tries when possible to contain the harm already done. At
times he has claimed to be overwhelmed by all the paperwork. At
other times he demonstrates the acumen for which he was once
famous, quibbling with the nuances of certain words _ even the
nuances of punctuation _ that appear in old bank memoranda
portraying him as an unrepentant debtor who was not above
mentioning his station in national politics.
</P>
<P>
   Then, when two hours have elapsed _ a time limit established in
deference to his age and illness _ Haughey is excused. A few
minutes later, the blue Mercedes carrying a small man in the
passenger seat pulls away from Dublin Castle, whose refurbishment
he oversaw when once in power.

 (ATTN: Wis., Texas, Ontario, Minn., Pa., Mass., N.C., N.Y.,
Wash.)   (For Release Aug. 6) 
By ABBY ELLIN   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   In the summer of 1997, Cyndi Wilson Porter, an assistant
chemistry professor at Lakeland College, in Sheboygan, Wis., was
asked to teach a class online. She hesitated at first _ she loved
the feel of a classroom, the camaraderie of live communication. She
did not want to be an anonymous piece of software somewhere beyond
the computer screen.
</P>
<P>
   But she did it, and soon, she said, she ``fell in love with the
interaction. ``On the ground, some students respond and others
don't; online, everyone does _ they have to,'' she said. ``Online,
the only way I know you're alive is if you participate, so we set
goals of how many times a week students have to respond. It's very
exciting.''
</P>
<P>
   Three years later, she is the assistant vice president for
extended academic programs and the director of Universe Online, a
nonprofit virtual arm of the University of the Incarnate Word in
San Antonio. Universe Online is starting up this fall and will
offer business classes for undergraduates, as well as courses
leading to an MBA. The online teachers are faculty members and
business owners.
</P>
<P>
   Universe Online is one of the many so-called distance-learning
programs hovering in cyberspace. According to reports from the
Department of Education, at least one-third of the 3,500 colleges
and universities in the United States offer distance-learning
courses; within the next two years, four of every five are expected
to do so.
</P>
<P>
   But neither faculty members nor administrators are sure about
some of the issues raised about intellectual property, like who
owns and who should control content that appears online. Does the
university or the faculty member who created an online course own
it? Who retains copyright to the material? The issue did not arise
before cybercourses, because the material and the teacher were
intertwined. But now many faculty members fear they will lose
control over the courses they teach, that their lessons will be
modified or prepackaged into a one-size-fits-all lecture by someone
at an online institution. How much freedom does a faculty member
have? Professors typically design traditional courses, and decide
which readings to assign and what information to deliver. But what
happens with an online course, where the methodologies are
different?
</P>
<P>
   David F. Noble, a history professor at York University in
Toronto, argues that distance learning contributes to the
commercialization of academia and that it forces universities to be
concerned only with turning a profit.
</P>
<P>
   ``Who owns the material you have placed on the Web site or
e-mail?'' he wrote in an essay called ``Digital Diploma Mills: The
Coming Battle Over Online Instruction,'' which, interestingly, he
posted on the Internet, at www.communication.ucsd.edu/dl. ``Without
a clear and definitive assertion of copyright claims by faculty,
the universities will usurp such rights by default.''
</P>
<P>
   Porter disagrees. Educators, she says, ``are hired to impart
knowledge, to help students learn. `Even as a traditional academic,
I have never understood the mindset of `I own this so I should be
able to sell it.' As a chemist, I share my knowledge. I didn't
invent chemistry or chemical concepts.'' She added, ``Since I am
paid by my school to share my knowledge, they in effect are leasing
me.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, some universities are concerned that professors will rake
in substantial sums by teaching classes to millions of people
across the globe, and that they will not share the tuition with
their institutions. They are also worried that some professors will
branch out on their own and teach courses for nontraditional
institutions like the Global Education Network, a company founded
by Herbert A. Allen, a venture capitalist.
</P>
<P>
   That is what happened with Arthur R. Miller, a Harvard Law
School professor who provides video courses for the Concord
University School of Law, a virtual school founded by Kaplan Inc.,
the test-preparation company. Miller, who markets many of his
Harvard lectures on videocassettes, contended that he was not
violating Harvard's policy of not providing course material to
another school while still teaching at Harvard, without permission.
Harvard said he was. According to Michael Chmura, a Harvard Law
School spokesman, the university issued new guidelines last spring
making clear that such online moonlighting was prohibited. But
Miller is still teaching at Concord, according to officials of that
school. Miller was out of the country and not immediately available
for comment, an assistant said.
</P>
<P>
   Some universities are signing deals themselves. UNext.com, a
virtual university backed by Michael Milken, the former junk bond
king, and Lawrence J. Ellison, the chairman of Oracle, has
agreements with Columbia University, Carnegie Mellon University,
the University of Chicago, the London School of Economics and
Stanford University to receive course materials from them for use
at an online for-profit virtual university, said Andrew M.
Rosenfield, an economist and lawyer who is a lecturer at the
University of Chicago Law School and the chief executive of
Unext.com. The school reaches agreements with faculty members at
other colleges to provide courses unique to UNext.
</P>
<P>
   Western Governors University, a virtual college, will develop
programs that provide academic credit for practical experience, and
will use course work from institutions throughout the United
States.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Still, while colleges and universities have long concerned
themselves with patentable items _ inventions or medical techniques
created in university laboratories _ many are unsure about how to
proceed with online materials.
</P>
<P>
   ``Schools never cared about literary endeavors,'' said Dan Burk,
professor of law at the University of Minnesota in Minneapolis, who
is an expert on intellectual property law and cyberlaw. ``There was
never enough money expected from one.'' But now that the economics
of ownership of academic materials is changing, he says, ``the vast
majority of universities don't know what they're doing. We have no
guidance.''
</P>
<P>
   Because the multimedia arena of distance learning is
copyrightable subject matter, some observers foresee a lot of money
being generated by online courses. For the past three years, for
example, Stanford's engineering school has taught 200 courses to
students all over the world _ at 140 percent of the school's normal
tuition. Duke University charges $95,000 for what it calls a Global
Executive MBA, a 19-month-long program that mixes a month on campus
and a month studying abroad with online study. (Tuition for the
traditional two-year MBA program is $28,200.)
</P>
<P>
   Administrators at Penn State view their online World Campus as
the 25th campus in the university system. Since it opened two years
ago, there has been a jump from 70 students to 2,895.
</P>
<P>
   At some schools, faculty members have protested the
consideration of courses on the Web. Nine hundred faculty members
at the University of Washington signed a petition opposing talk of
a virtual university. Professors at Cornell have expressed
discomfort with e-Cornell, a for-profit subsidiary to develop and
market online courses, said Bill Steele, a university spokesman.
Details of the program have not yet been completed.
</P>
<P>
   Beyond the focus on ownership, Burk cites deeper, more complex
issues that are at stake _ like career, competition, status and
money.
</P>
<P>
   If Miller at Harvard wanted to take a sabbatical to teach at
another bricks-and-mortar institution, ``nobody would have cared,''
he said. But now, ``what they're saying is that we don't want you
to pull a paycheck from Harvard and also teach online. Harvard's
not happy to have its name affiliated with a nonaccredited
school.''
</P>
<P>
   Chmura said the issue was not the linking of names, but assuring
that Harvard faculty members give most of their attention to
Harvard students. There are also issues of ego and respect. Both
came up when faculty members at the University of Chicago were
asked by administrators to develop materials for UNext.com. ``It
makes them sound like they're working for a big corporation, where
their bosses can give them an assignment,'' said Burk.
</P>
<P>
   Ultimately, the courses those faculty members develop count
toward their required teaching load, but they do not earn any extra
pay for creating them, said Larry Arbeiter, a University of Chicago
spokesman. There is no consensus about many of the questions
raised. Some schools have decided to use revenue from online
courses as a way of paying faculty. Others are considering the
model of the recording and entertainment industries; faculty
members would own the rights to online instructional materials and
would be allowed to sell material to online colleges. Some people
expect professors to hire agents to broker deals for them.
</P>
<P>
   In May, Duke's Academic Council approved a policy that set
guidelines allowing professors to retain ownership of all courses
they created as individuals, but allowing the university to retain
ownership of some courses they created using university property.
The University of Texas has a similar policy, which calls for joint
ownership of courses created using the university's funds or
personnel.
</P>
<P>
   At the University of Minnesota, faculty members retain ownership
of any Web-based courses they create, unless there is a prior
agreement to the contrary. Porter said Universe Online pays a
faculty member 5 percent of the tuition it receives for an online
course for each of the first five times the course is offered.
</P>
<P>
   She said: ``There's no difference between online and on-ground
teaching other than the actual method of delivery. Instead of
standing up and talking, I now type. When I do an online class, I'm
still just sharing my knowledge. When I teach a course on-ground, I
get paid as part of my salary. When I teach a class online, I also
get paid as part of my salary. But everyone wants a piece of the
pie.'' But the issue of dividing the pie is more pressing when,
unlike Porter, the faculty member whose course is offered online
does not participate in teaching it, because then he or she will
either be paid for assembling the content or not be paid at all.
</P>
<P>
   The American Association of University Professors has drafted
model contracts that give faculty members financial interests in
courses that are adapted to online presentations. Burk of Minnesota
predicts the debate will quiet down as people realize that there is
not a pot of gold at the other end of the modem.
</P>
<P>
   ``Part of what's driving this is that these online courses are
multimedia intensive, with video, graphics, music, and text.
They're new and hot, and both the institution and faculty seem to
think there will be a bunch of money out there,'' Burk said. ``But
the reality is that these blockbuster moneymaking gold-rush
scenarios probably won't happen. I am hoping people will realize
there's not a gold mine and come to their senses.''

METS DEFEAT REDS 2-1 
</HEADLINE>
   By TYLER KEPNER   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Six weeks ago, John Franco was called into a tie game
at Shea Stadium. He allowed one run, recorded one out and left with
the bases loaded. Then Armando Benitez came in and gave up a grand
slam. That was the last time either of those Mets pitchers allowed
an earned run.
</P>
<P>
   Franco, Benitez and Turk Wendell shut down the Cincinnati Reds
Wednesday to give the Mets and Al Leiter a 2-1 victory, completing
an 8-1 homestand in which they did everything but gain significant
ground on the Atlanta Braves in the National League East. The Mets
trailed Atlanta by five and a half games before the Braves' game
last night at Arizona; they were six back before the homestand.
</P>
<P>
   Robin Ventura's two-run home run in the first inning gave Leiter
and the bullpen all the necessary run support. Leiter improved to
12-4 by working seven strong innings, and seven innings are all the
Mets need these days. If they have a lead by then, they believe
they will win. ``That's a really good feeling to have,'' first
baseman Todd Zeile said.
</P>
<P>
   Mets relievers allowed only two earned runs in 212/3 innings on
this homestand, and they have been brilliant for three weeks. The
current group has an earned run average of 0.99 since the All-Star
Game, and it is easy to see why the Mets have been able to win by
one or two runs in 10 of their last 13 victories.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is what everybody envisioned early in the year, that the
bullpen would be one of our strong points,'' Franco said. ``We
picked it up.''
</P>
<P>
   The biggest games on the homestand, catcher Todd Pratt said,
were the two victories over Montreal in a doubleheader last
Thursday. In the first game, Grant Roberts, a rookie, gave up seven
runs in less than two innings. But four relievers held down the
Expos to make a comeback victory possible. In the nightcap, Mike
Hampton pitched a complete game.
</P>
<P>
   A rested bullpen helped the Mets win their next two games
against St. Louis, and Bobby J. Jones pitched a complete game in
the finale on Sunday against the Cardinals, resting the bullpen
again.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're rested, confident and shortening the game,'' Manager
Bobby Valentine said. ``I think that adds to the confidence of the
team.''
</P>
<P>
   After Leiter struck out the side in the seventh inning
Wednesday, completing a stretch in which he retired 18 of 19
hitters, Franco came in to face the top of the order in the eighth.
He got two outs, then had two strikes on Ken Griffey Jr. when Zeile
moved closer to the line at first, protecting against an extra-base
hit. Griffey bounced one to the spot Zeile vacated for a single,
and Wendell was summoned.
</P>
<P>
   On Tuesday, Wendell had allowed a run-scoring triple to Dante
Bichette, the only batter he faced. He faced Bichette again
Wednesday, throwing one pitch that Bichette grounded to first,
ending the inning.
</P>
<P>
   Benitez worked a 1-2-3 ninth for his 27th save, and after the
game he gave credit to one of his setup men, Franco.
</P>
<P>
   ``If Franco doesn't do the job, I don't do the job,'' Benitez
said. ``We have good communication. What he's doing, it's great.''
</P>
<P>
   What is Franco doing? ``Just trying to get outs and get the ball
to Armando,'' he said. And what is working? ``Just everything,
really,'' Franco said. ``The change-up, the fastball's moving in
and out, just trying to throw strikes and let them put it in play.
We've got guys behind us that are pretty good fielders.''
</P>
<P>
   One of those guys is Mike Bordick, the veteran shortstop
acquired from Baltimore in a trade last week. In the fourth inning,
Bordick reached up to spear a hard grounder from Pokey Reese that
shot up over his right shoulder on one hop. Such plays are almost
routine with Bordick, who played his first game with the Mets last
Saturday, the same day that Ventura, the third baseman, another
excellent fielder, was activated from the disabled list.
</P>
<P>
   The Mets have missed Ventura's bat this year. Bothered by a
bruised right rotator cuff, Ventura slumped before the All-Star
Game break and did not feel better the first day after it. He did
not make much of Wednesday's homer _ ``I'd rather be lucky than
good,'' Ventura said, quizzically _ but acknowledged how much the
Mets need him, especially when he bats fifth, behind Mike Piazza.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you bat behind Mike,'' he said, ``you don't want people
to walk him. The job for the person batting behind him is to make
sure they pitch to him and give him pitches to hit, and you have to
be getting singles and everything else to do that.''
</P>
<P>
   Wednesday, Ventura batted third while Piazza rested. Ventura's
home run was his 17th, second only to Piazza on the Mets. But he
has only 39 singles, and he said he wanted to be more consistent in
getting base hits. The Mets, who have the second-best record in the
National League, can wait.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought all of Robin's swings today were Robinesque,''
Valentine said. ``There's no doubt that he's a guy we're counting
on, depending on, and we're going to jump on his back a few times
before this thing's over. Today was one of those days.''
</P>
<P>
   The bullpen also carried its load, just as it has for weeks.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're clicking pretty well,'' Wendell said, ``but we know we
can still pitch a little better.''

EMPOWERED WOMEN IN STILETTOS? THAT'S A HOWL
</HEADLINE>
 UGLY-TEX  (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
 By ROBERT PHILPOT 
 c.2000 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   In a rambling article in the August issue of ``George,'' Kate
Bohner writes about ``stiletto feminism'' _ the idea that women
should be able to make their sexuality work for them, and still
have complete control of their lives. Bohner was inspired, in part,
by ``Coyote Ugly,'' and she quotes the movie's producer, Jerry
Bruckheimer, as saying, ``This is a film about women who go for
what they want.''
</P>
<P>
   Oh, baloney. Bruckheimer may be hyping ``Coyote Ugly,'' but he's
spreading horse hockey. ``Coyote Ugly'' is about re-inventing
``Flashdance'' with Maxim cover models wearing tight,
midriff-baring clothing, dancing on bar tops, setting carefully
stunt-coordinated fires and pouring alcohol, water and ice on
everyone, especially themselves. And for most of its running time,
it has the good sense to know it.
</P>
<P>
   Yeah, as the ads say, its women call the shots, but if
``Coyote'' is empowering, it's not because of ``stiletto feminism''
but because it follows a well-trodden trajectory. To put it in the
movie's mentality, it's just a story about a lil' ol' small-town
gal who makes it in the big, bad city. Keen observers might note
that a couple of the ``empowered'' women are stuck in
one-dimensional, underwritten roles and that although Violet, our
protagonist, vanquishes the stage fright that hinders her success,
she overcomes her other problems not through any special effort,
but because they all kind of solve themselves.
</P>
<P>
   That said, much of ``Coyote Ugly'' is stupid fun, sublimely
silly until it veers recklessly into absurdity and dime-store
sentimentality. It's no wonder the bar scenes dominate the
previews; they crackle with such energy that they overwhelm the
rest of the movie, even when they are just a notch shy of
incoherent. And Gina Wendkos' screenplay _ reportedly punched up by
Carrie Fisher in an uncredited rewrite _ partially makes up for the
hokeyness of its plot by actually including lines that have a
certain level of wit, an increasing rarity in a movie culture in
which passing gas passes for humor.
</P>
<P>
   But boy, does that script load down poor Violet, played by
relative newcomer Piper Perabo, who's cursed with such a girlish
voice that she seems more likely to dance on a junior-high
cafeteria table than a Manhattan bar. Violet is an aspiring
songwriter who's too shy to perform her own stuff _ just like her
late beloved mother. Mom died five years previously, leaving Violet
alone with her lovable lug of a father (John Goodman), who is, of
course, reluctant to let his only daughter leave their little New
Jersey town and tackle the Big Apple.
</P>
<P>
   Over in New York, Violet tries to shop around a demo tape,
stumbling into a romance with a charming Australian short-order
cook (Adam Garcia) along the way. She also stumbles into a job at
Coyote Ugly, where she has trouble fitting in until her quick mouth
and peacemaking skills convince the boss that, yes, Violet has what
it takes to be a Coyote, too.
</P>
<P>
   Everything's fine until the screenplay decides to provide
obstacles for Violet to overcome _ and most viewers will be able to
spot them a mile away, because the script isn't so much written as
it's charted on a graph, with all the characters in Violet's orbit
having their own points A, B and C. Some of those characters _
fellow bartenders Cammie (Izabella Miko) and Rachel (Bridget
Moynahan), and Coyote Ugly alumnus Zoe (Tyra Banks) _ are
prominently featured in the ads, but in the movie they're barely
ciphers, identified by one-word characteristics and probably
sharing less than 20 lines of dialogue among them. Only former
``ER'' player Maria Bello, as Violet's tough-as-chewing-gum boss,
shows much spark beyond the rowdy bar scenes.
</P>
<P>
   The ``Flashdance'' comparison might seem like a cheap critical
shortcut, except that Bruckheimer also produced ``Flashdance,'' and
you know he's out to duplicate that movie's success. It's not for
nothing that director David McNally's shots include a sexy
silhouette and a sensual bar-top dousing. Nevertheless, the movie
looks like a hit, and it's likely to do for Perabo what
``Flashdance'' did for Jennifer Beals. Um ... just what did
``Flashdance'' do for Jennifer Beals, anyway?
</P>
<P>
   ``Coyote Ugly'' is rated PG-13 for sexual situations, scattered
foul language and lots of alcohol. &QL; 
 &QL; 
FILM: ``Coyote Ugly'' &QL; 
SCORE: 21/2 on a 1-5 scale &QL; 
DIRECTOR: David McNally &QL;

RUSSIA'S GAZPROM MOVES TO TAKE CONTROL OF MEDIA GROUP CRITICAL OF
GOVERNMENT 
</HEADLINE>
   By SABRINA TAVERNISE   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   MOSCOW _ A senior Russian official said Wednesday that the
government-controlled company Gazprom is negotiating to acquire the
entire media empire of Vladimir Gusinsky, the Kremlin's most
outspoken critic.
</P>
<P>
   In an interview, Vladislav Surkov, deputy head of the
presidential administration, confirmed what had been speculated for
days: that Russia's natural gas company Gazprom may take over
Media-Most by calling in debts.
</P>
<P>
   Media-Most owes hundreds of millions of dollars to Gazprom, and
the companies have been haggling over Media-Most's value.
</P>
<P>
   Media-Most has hired foreign auditors and wants to establish
what the company is worth, believing the debt would entitle Gazprom
to only a small percentage of the company, according to company
officials.
</P>
<P>
   Gazprom argues otherwise, saying that the debt should be
exchanged for all of Media-Most.
</P>
<P>
   Though the talks are inconclusive so far, journalists and
political analysts said the Kremlin is trying to assert control
over Russia's three biggest television networks.
</P>
<P>
   The government has begun talks with magnate Boris Berezovsky on
his 49 percent stake in the country's biggest television network,
ORT. He has mentioned a willingness to sell.
</P>
<P>
   In the case of Gazprom and Media-Most, ``talks are being
conducted, they are already drawing to a close,'' said Surkov.
``It's possible that in exchange for these debts the entire holding
will be transferred to Gazprom.''
</P>
<P>
   The move against Media-Most by Gazprom, 38 percent of which is
owned by the government, apparently shows that though President
Vladimir Putin has promised the country's richest men that the
state will not take away their assets, he may have other ways to
reduce their influence.
</P>
<P>
   Wednesday's statement highlights the conflict between the
Kremlin and Gusinsky, who has been under pressure since May when
masked law enforcement officers raided his offices in central
Moscow. He was jailed for a while in June, though the criminal case
against him was dropped last month.
</P>
<P>
   At the heart of the struggle is control over Gusinsky's media
assets, which include NTV, a large television network, and a new,
American-made satellite, as well as Itogi news magazine, Echo
Moscow radio station, and the Sevodnya newspaper. The current talks
will determine how much of the business Gusinsky is left with, or
whether he's left with none.
</P>
<P>
   Control of the media business might not extend to NTV, however,
because it is registered as a separate legal entity.
</P>
<P>
   ``Though their political interests may not be made public, de
facto they exist,'' said Boris Makarenko, deputy director of the
Center for Political Technologies, an independent Moscow-based
think tank. ``When a company friendly to the government acquires a
controlling interest in Media-Most, the government accomplishes its
goal. Media-Most as a hotbed of political opposition will cease to
exist.''
</P>
<P>
   Media-Most denied that the talks focus on handing control to
Gazprom, and said it is striving in the talks to agree to a
valuation for the company. Media-Most values its assets at more
than $2 billion, while Gazprom says the figure is much lower.
</P>
<P>
   Gazprom has extended loan guarantees totaling about $380 million
to Media-Most, and already owns, directly and indirectly, just less
than 50 percent of the media company. Media-Most is also
negotiating with foreign investors for capital, which _ if
successful _ could release it from government pressure.
</P>
<P>
   In June, Gazprom asked Media-Most to pay the debts after Putin,
on a trip to Europe, remarked on the question of why Gazprom had
become a creditor in the first place. In the same month, Putin
reasserted Kremlin control over the gas monopoly, installing a
close adviser, Dmitry Medvedev, as chairman of the board.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the state's rocky relations with Gusinsky, recent
attacks on some of the country's most powerful businessmen are not
a systematic state policy, said Surkov, of the presidential
administration. Law enforcement authorities have acted too rashly
in the recent spate of investigations, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Putin has said there won't be any review of privatization and
the law enforcement agencies now understand that,'' Surkov he said.
``It's the role of the government to hold back these unhealthy
tendencies.''
</P>
<P>
   One powerful business leader, who requested his name not be
used, said Putin has not distanced himself entirely from big
business, as he has not yet pushed out Roman Abramovich, a close
friend of Boris Yeltsin's family.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's not equal distance from all of the oligarchs yet,''
said the executive, who attended a meeting Putin held on Friday
with Gazprom's top business leaders.

   Schlafly, 75, was a national co-chair of Pat Buchanan's GOP bid
for the presidency in 1996. Although Buchanan has bolted to the
Reform Party, Schlafly is backing the GOP, and vowing vigilance
that the Bush-Cheney ticket does not back off from the
anti-abortion cause.
</P>
<P>
   ``They've done all right so far,'' Schlafly said in an
interview. ``It is important for us to keep on them to give us what
we want.''
</P>
<P>
   Does she feel any tugs toward Buchanan? ``The important thing is
to defeat Al Gore,'' Schlafly replied.
</P>
<P>
   Schlafly first made waves in 1964 when her book, ``A Choice Not
An Echo,'' was published. It argued that the Republican Party had
lost one presidential election after another due to what she called
the ``me too'' attitude of its Eastern establishment and not
sticking to its convictions.
</P>
<P>
   Victory, she maintained, lay in the unbending conservatism of
Arizona Sen. Barry Goldwater.
</P>
<P>
   Goldwater won the GOP nomination, but lost the 1964 election by
16 million votes to Lyndon Johnson. Schlafly was rebuffed in a
subsequent bid for the presidency of the National Federation of
Republican Women. She also lost a race for Congress from southern
Illinois.
</P>
<P>
   It took 16 years, but the conservative movement swept to victory
in 1980, putting in the White House a man who rose to national
prominence in the Goldwater campaign _ Ronald Reagan.
</P>
<P>
   While using her Eagle Forum to fight the ERA, Schlafly also was
an early, passionate advocate of an anti-ballistic missile system
and space-based defense. Missile defenses are a key part of Bush's
defense and national security platform.
</P>
<P>
   Wednesday, Schlafly cited the GOP platform committee's
unwavering stand on abortion. It even rejected language
acknowledging legitimate differences of opinion on the issue. ``The
good news is not only that we won, but that we won big and more
decisively than ever before,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Schlafly told her audience Wednesday that its work will not end
with Bush's election.
</P>
<P>
   ``We need to continue to urge him to be as steadfast in naming
pro-life judges as President Clinton has been steadfast in naming
pro-abortion judges,'' she said.

   PHILADELPHIA _ These are complicated times for social
conservatives. They feel they are winning on their core issues at
this Republican National Convention, but some of them clearly miss
the red-meat rhetoric and partisan edge of conventions past,
replaced this week by the Bush campaign's relentless appeal to the
center.
</P>
<P>
   There was, unmistakably, a wave of grumbling in the conservative
ranks _ about the shortage of strong conservative voices on the
stage, about the prime-time convention speech awarded to an openly
gay member of Congress, about the lack of a stronger and more
direct condemnation of the Clinton-Gore administration.
</P>
<P>
   But inside the conservative movement, as in the Republican Party
more broadly, there is an overriding desire to win in November. So
social conservatives are focusing on the victories of Philadelphia
_ notably, a strong anti-abortion platform and the selection of a
running mate, Dick Cheney, who is a staunch anti-abortion
conservative.
</P>
<P>
   Some argue that the Bush campaign has merely repackaged core
conservatism into a more inclusive appeal; others say that they may
well have to remind George W. Bush of his conservative commitments
once he is elected; all agree, passionately, that he is infinitely
better than Vice President Al Gore.
</P>
<P>
   So, the Rev. Jerry Falwell and other leaders were putting out
the word that it was time to hold ranks, maintain discipline and
help the Bush campaign win.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some of our people have just got to grow up,'' said Falwell,
when asked about the grumbling in an interview on Wednesday. ``We
have a platform that is strongly pro-life, pro-family, pro-strong
national defense. We have a presidential candidate and a
vice-presidential candidate, both of whom are pro-life, pro-family
and pro-strong national defense.''
</P>
<P>
   He added, ``Our crowd needs to get into the battle, keep their
mouths shut and help this man win.''
</P>
<P>
   Chuck Sigerson, chairman of the Nebraska Republican Party and a
longtime member of the Christian Coalition, noted: ``You know, in
1992, all the left-wing Democrats were mad at Bill Clinton. They
didn't like a lot of the things that Bill Clinton stood for because
he was a New Democrat. But what did they do? They shut up, because
they knew that although he was not as left wing as them, at least
they thought not, they knew if he got elected they could still get
most of their programs through. And they did.''
</P>
<P>
   The unease among some social conservatives bubbled up on the
convention floor on Tuesday night when a small group of Texas
delegates protested in silent prayer while Rep. Jim Kolbe of
Arizona, who is gay, spoke on trade. Cathie Adams, president of the
Texas Eagle Forum and one of those protesting delegates, said that
Kolbe's selection was ``all about affirmative action.''
</P>
<P>
   Adams added, alluding to social conservatives: ``We're not the
favored sons. That's very apparent and that makes me sad. I think
the core of the Republican Party is what the governor needs to get
elected.''
</P>
<P>
   Colleen Parro, director of the Republican National Coalition for
Life, said of the Kolbe choice, ``If they wanted diversity, why
didn't they ask Alan Keyes to speak?'' Keyes, who was a contender
in the Republican primaries, is black and staunchly conservative.
</P>
<P>
   And Chuck Donovan, acting president of the conservative Family
Research Council, described the proceedings this week as a ``Sally
Field convention _ you love me, you really love me.'' But he
quickly added: ``In terms of substantive action, the platform and
the choice of Cheney, social conservatives have every reason to be
pleased. And if you've got to choose something, take the substance
over the symbol.''
</P>
<P>
   Once Bush is elected, Donovan added, ``We'll certainly be there
with the fire that's in the platform and say, `This is the fire
we're going to hold your feet to.'''
</P>
<P>
   The Family Research Council gave the platform good grades for
reasserting the party's opposition to legalized abortion, its
endorsement of tax cuts, its defense of traditional marriage and
and its declaration that homosexuality is ``incompatible'' with
military service.
</P>
<P>
   Ralph Reed, a former executive director of the Christian
Coalition and now a top Bush adviser, said in an interview on
Wednesday that ``social conservatives have become increasingly
mature and sophisticated about the political process and understand
that a political party is not a church, and that becoming a
governing majority requires that you work with others with whom you
occasionally disagree. And if there wasn't a full understanding of
that eight or 10 years ago, there certainly is now.''
</P>
<P>
   At a crowded rally on Tuesday at a downtown hotel, the Rev. Pat
Robertson, founder of the Christian Coalition, highlighted the
stakes for religious conservatives in the coming election, focusing
on the Supreme Court.
</P>
<P>
   ``Five people can decide the destiny of unborn children,''
Robertson thundered. ``Five people can decide whether we can pray
or not pray.'' He added, ``It looks as if two or three of those
unelected officials are getting ready to retire or go on up to that
great court in the sky.''
</P>
<P>
   Promising a re-energized Christian Coalition campaign this fall,
with 75 million voting guides distributed through the churches,
Robertson told his cheering audience, ``We need to have the
election of a man who will appoint righteous judges to the court of
the United States.''
</P>
<P>
   The paramount importance of the abortion issue was cited again
and again by social conservatives this week. Well before he had the
nomination, Bush signaled that he would support the current
abortion plank, which calls for a ban on the procedure without
exception, and the appointment of judges who support the ``sanctity
of innocent human life.'' Bush says he personally would allow
abortion in cases of rape, incest or when the life of the woman is
in danger.
</P>
<P>
   And while Bush says he does not have a litmus test for the
appointment of judges, a New York Times/CBS News poll taken in late
July showed that conservative Republicans overwhelmingly expected
him to appoint Supreme Court justices who would vote against
abortion rights.
</P>
<P>
   Carol Tobias, political director of the National Right to Life
Committee, said on Wednesday afternoon, ``We're really very pleased
with the way things are going.'' Asked about the scant mention of
abortion from the convention podium, she replied: ``We're keeping
everything in perspective. We got the important things, and we're
very happy.''

CHENEY GOES ON THE ATTACK IN SPEECH TO CONVENTION 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By GLEN JOHNSON  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHILADELPHIA _ After Republicans spent two days casting
themselves as a kinder, gentler party, Dick Cheney dug into the
Clinton administration Wednesday in his vice presidential
acceptance speech, reprising Al Gore's famed line from 1992 and
declaring, ``It is time for them to go.''
</P>
<P>
   The former Wyoming congressman and defense secretary used his
first major address back in the political spotlight not only to
acknowledge his unexpected role as George W. Bush's running mate,
but also to serve notice that he will be more than just the loyal
running mate the Texas governor sought.
</P>
<P>
   While the names of President Clinton and Bush's Democratic
opponent, Vice President Al Gore, were not uttered during the first
half of the convention, Cheney showed he will not shrink form the
attacking role that Gore took on in 1992, as did Dan Quayle,
President Bush's running mate in 1988.
</P>
<P>
   ``What are we going to make of the last eight years?'' Cheney
said in remarks prepared for delivery to the thousands inside the
First Union Center and, more importantly, the millions more
watching on television. ``I look at them and see opportunities
squandered.''
</P>
<P>
   Then, poking at Gore with the line that became a delegate chant
during the 1992 Democratic National Convention in New York, he
added the applause line: ``The wheel has turned. It is time for
them to go.'
</P>
<P>
   The 59-year-old Cheney had been head of a $9 billion company,
the Halliburton Co., until Bush asked him to help find a running
mate and then settled on Cheney himself last month.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have to tell you that I never expected to be in this
position,'' Cheney said in remarks he largely wrote himself. ``But
now I am back in the arena and let me tell you why: I have been
given an opportunity to serve beside a man who has the courage and
the vision and the goodness to be a great president: Governor
George W. Bush,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Among those expected in the convention hall was Bush's father,
former President Bush, who plucked Cheney from the House in 1989
and appointed him defense secretary. In that role, Cheney achieved
his greatest fame, serving alongside Generals Colin Powell and
Norman Schwarzkopf to assemble that 28-nation allied coalition that
defeated Iraq after it invaded Kuwait in 1990. Both Powell and
Schwarzkopf addressed the delegates earlier this week.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have been in the company of leaders,'' Cheney said. ``I know
what it takes. And I see in our nominee the qualities of mind and
spirit our nation needs and our history demands. Big changes are
coming to Washington. To serve with this man, in this cause, is a
chance I would not miss.''
</P>
<P>
   Cheney has lived in Dallas for the last five years, coinciding
with Bush's election as Texas governor in 1994. He offered a
testimonial to Bush's style of governance.
</P>
<P>
   ``Bush doesn't accept old lines of argument and division. He
brings people together, reaching across the partisan aisle to do
the people's business. He leads by conviction, not calculation. You
will never see him pointing the finger of blame for failure; you
will only see him sharing credit for success,'' Cheney said.
</P>
<P>
   Aides said Bush was watching the speech from his hotel room in
Center City, several miles north of the convention hall. The
governor will address the delegates Thursday night, and he has been
trying to stay rested so he delivers a strong performance.
</P>
<P>
   Bush and Cheney were reunited in Philadelphia at midday
Wednesday, when the two were the star attractions at Republican
National Committee luncheon expected to raise up to $10 million for
the party.
</P>
<P>
   Cheney did not speak, but he and his wife, Lynne, joined Bush
and his wife, Laura, on stage before the governor paid tribute to
his running mate.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a man of enormous integrity, great depth, solid
judgment. He's really fun to be around. I care for him a lot.
America's going to care for him a lot. I'm proud to call him friend
and this great man, I'm going to be proud to call him `Mr. Vice
President,''' Bush said to an ovation.
</P>
<P>
   The speech came at a time when Democrats have been hammering
Cheney for a compiling a staunchly conservative voting record
during his six terms in Congress. They argue that clashes with
Bush's attempt to recast the party as more moderate ``compassionate
conservatives.''
</P>
<P>
   Senator Craig Thomas, Republican of Wyoming, said he doubted the
speech would change many minds about Cheney.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think he'll just reestablish what people pretty much know,''
Thomas said.

<P>
   ``AMERICAN RHAPSODY''
</P>
<P>
   ByJoe Eszterhas
</P>
<P>
   (Knopf, $25.95)
</P>
<P>
   We'll say right upfront that we felt as if we earned our salary
for the next five years as we struggled through this book, a
quagmire of gonzo posturing and other strange liberties to which
Eszterhas believes he's entitled. The former (beginitalic)Rolling
Stone(enditalic) writer, having made his money with screenplays to
such scintillating films as (beginitalic)Showgirls(enditalic) and
(beginitalic)Basic Instinct(enditalic)(beginitalic), (enditalic)
now shows us the real Bill Clinton or, as Eszterhas' friend, Jann
Wenner, called him, ``the first rock and roll president in American
history.'' Eszterhas was mesmerized by the Monica Lewinsky sex
scandal. He devoured the Starr report, watched it on television,
read about it in magazines. Maybe they are his sources for the
garish ``non-fiction'' sections here, but he never really makes
that clear (there are fictional parts too, including a chapter
narrated by ``Willard,'' the most famous part of Clinton's
anatomy). Read this at your own risk. And remember: No one's paying
you to do it.

   ``LOCO FOR LIZARDS''
</P>
<P>
   By Jim Cherry
</P>
<P>
   (Northland, $7.95)
</P>
<P>
   Lizards, Cherry notes, predate dinosaurs, continents, even -
gasp! - (beginitalic)S(enditalic)(beginitalic)trom
Thurmond(enditalic). If that doesn't leave you hungry for more, you
are a hard sell. This brief, well-illustrated book tells you
everything you always wanted to know about lizards and a lot you
could have done without but aren't troubled to hear, such as the
fact that a monitor lizard can run 10 mph to catch the wild pigs it
likes for supper or that its mouth is so full of bacteria that its
bite will kill its victim within a day or two even if it gets away.
Cherry also includes general information on lizards in myth, art
and advertising and in film (we were delighted to see not just
(beginitalic)Godzilla(enditalic) and (beginitalic)Journey to the
Center of the Earth(enditalic) but also (beginitalic)The
Freshman(enditalic), Andrew Bergman's comedy in which a Komodo
dragon gets loose in a shopping mall). This is a good book to hand
over to visitors from the East as they watch geckos skitter across
your block wall.
</P>
<P>
   ``POOR RICHARD'S ALMANACK''
</P>
<P>
   By Benjamin Franklin
</P>
<P>
   (Modern Library, $10.95)
</P>
<P>
   Early to bed and early to rise makes a man miss pretty much
everything good on TV. That's Ben Franklin updated by Dave Barry in
his introduction to this new edition. Barry is hilarious, in fact,
as he questions the wisdom of a few of Franklin's statements -
particularly ``if your head is wax, don't walk in the sun'' - and
heartily endorses others. ``Poor Richard advocates diligence,
self-reliance, frugality and honesty,'' writes Barry. ``He disdains
laziness, extravagance, pretense and immodesty. It goes without
saying that he hates lawyers.'' This is one of the first four books
in the Modern Library Humor and Wit series. Others are
(beginitalic)Mark Twain's Library of Humor(enditalic), with an
introduction by Roy Blount, Jr.; (beginitalic)Most of the Most of
S.J. Perelman(enditalic); and (beginitalic)Crazy Salad: Some Things
About (enditalic)(beginitalic)Women(enditalic) by Nora Ephron. The
series is edited by Steve Martin, who insists that Perelman stole
his material.
</P>
<P>
   ``BE THE ONE''
</P>
<P>
   By April Smith
</P>
<P>
   (Knopf, $24)
</P>
<P>
   Cassidy Sanderson is a formidable woman - tall, blond, athletic
and savvy enough to be a baseball scout for the Dodgers, the only
female scout in the major leagues. The competition to find new
players is stiff, and when she gets a call from an old friend in
the Dominican Republic, she quickly flies down to see the ``pure
hitter'' he has discovered. Alberto Cruz does have talent so
Cassidy signs him and brings him back to Los Angeles, but soon
Alberto begins receiving mysterious blackmail notes. Flashbacks
throughout this novel reveal that the notes are tied to a
mysterious night in the Dominican Republic when Cassidy, Alberto
and a wealthy American businessman drove drunkenly through a
hurricane just before their return to the United States. The novel
is suspenseful and well characterized although longer than it needs
to be. Smith will appear at the Poisoned Pen bookstore. See Book
Signings for details.
</P>
<P>
   ``AN INVISIBLE SIGN OF MY OWN''
</P>
<P>
   By Aimee Bender
</P>
<P>
   (Doubleday, $22.95)
</P>
<P>
   Bender's odd but very effective first novel is narrated by
20-year-old Mona Gray, a troubled young woman who struggles with
psychological scars and obsessions even as she forms attachments to
some very strange second-graders at her hometown elementary school,
where she has been hired to teach mathematics. Emotionally affected
by her father's poor health since she was 10, Mona is the ultimate
unreliable narrator, her sanity seemingly so fragile that for a
long time we don't know what to make of her. She finds comfort in
numbers - they are the constant force in her mind, her only
reliable port in life's storm. In a voice that is both witty and
spooky, Mona tells us about her students, her family and her inner
life, hinting at potential violence even as she embarks on a sweet
romance with a fellow teacher. It's a mark of Bender's subtle
virtuosity that such a surreal story is ultimately so appealing.
She's a writer to watch.
</P>
<P>
   ``THE DAY JOHN DIED''
</P>
<P>
   By Christopher Andersen
</P>
<P>
   (Morrow, $26)
</P>
<P>
   Andersen opens this book by trying to justify it, alluding to
the ``ocean of grief'' into which we all allegedly plunged upon
hearing of John F. Kennedy Jr.'s death and pointing out Kennedy's
similarities to Princess Diana (which amount to little more than
that both were ``lit from within,'' and we were obsessed with
them). You'll forgive us if we tell you that books like this make
us feel squirrelly as if we're watching a bank heist in progress
and doing nothing to stop it. But Andersen has cased this joint
before (he wrote not only (beginitalic)The Day
(enditalic)(beginitalic)John Died (enditalic)but also
(beginitalic)Jack and Jackie (enditalic)and Jackie After Jack), and
he knows where the money is. Happily, Kennedy comes off well. His
marriage was doing better; his rebellious youth was spent; and he
was, to all appearances, a good man. And we defy you to remain
unmoved at the description of the funeral service, marked by a
stunned and battered family's grief over another gone too soon.
</P>
<P>
   ``FROM OUR HOUSE: A MEMOIR''
</P>
<P>
   By Lee Martin
</P>
<P>
   (Dutton, $22.95)
</P>
<P>
   This memoir begins with a ghoulish tragedy but becomes the oddly
uplifting story of the author's determination to understand the
dynamics of his own family. In 1956, when Martin was a baby, his
father, Roy, lost both hands in an accident with a harvesting
machine on their 80-acre farm in Illinois. Roy Martin was already a
coarse, difficult man, but his misfortune instilled in him a new
level of anger. Over the years, he beat and berated his son while
Lee's mother looked on. ``I was too young to know then,'' Martin
writes, ``that she was as helpless in my father's house as I.'' But
to dismiss Roy as a villain is to deny the complexities that exist
in unhappy families. Martin explores his own responses to his
father, and so takes his story beyond self-pity and makes it an act
of salvation. His book is an unflinching look at the bonds between
a wounded man and his son and at the stoic perseverance of the
woman who loved them both.
</P>
<P>
   ``WHY WE HURT''
</P>
<P>
   By Frank T. Vertosick
</P>
<P>
   (Harcourt, $24)
</P>
<P>
   It's unsettling, reading about pain. We suspect that any amount
of discourse on specific pain would be easier to take - you have a
migraine, you have a bad back, you're looking for solutions. But
this book, subtitled (beginitalic)The Natural History of
Pain(enditalic), covers the whole gamut of discomfort, and it made
us squirm. Cancer pain, spinal pain, migraine pain, the pain of
childbirth, of carpal tunnel syndrome, of kidney stones or worse.
Vertosick, who is a neurosurgeon, eases the way with his friendly,
nonchalant tone, and he reminds us often that in the grand scheme
of things, pain has a purpose. It is, he says, ``a teacher, the
headmaster of nature's survival school.'' He discusses some of his
own patients and how he alleviated their pain and gives lots of
time, bless him, to the miracle of anesthesia, which he ranks as
one of the great achievements of our age. So do we, but right now
we're going to take some aspirin. We're not sure why.

   Audiences didn't know what to make of (beginitalic)Blood Simple
(enditalic)when it first popped up in 1984.
</P>
<P>
   In the era of (beginitalic)E.T. (enditalic)and
(beginitalic)Raiders of the Lost Ark(enditalic), here was a dark,
claustrophobic movie made on a tiny budget, with no big names in
the cast. The film's creators were two rookies: Joel and Ethan
Coen. The ``star'' was character actor M. Emmet Walsh, backed up by
an unknown actress named Frances McDormand.
</P>
<P>
   There was no way to tell the good guys from the bad guys. Every
time you thought you felt solid ground, a plot twist knocked you
off your feet. The whole thing just smacked of originality.
</P>
<P>
   But the style only seemed new. (beginitalic)Blood
Simple(enditalic), which was being re-released as a ``director's
cut'' in theaters Friday, was actually an homage to film noir, a
term coined by the French to describe American films released near
the end and in the aftermath of World War II.
</P>
<P>
   ``The hallmark of film noir is its sense of people trapped,''
Robert Sklar writes in (beginitalic)Movie-Made America,
(enditalic)''trapped in webs of paranoia and fear, unable to tell
guilt from innocence, true identity from false.
</P>
<P>
   ``Its villains are attractive and sympathetic, masking greed,
misanthropy, malevolence. Its heroes and heroines are weak,
confused, susceptible to false impressions.''
</P>
<P>
   Not exactly Steven Spielberg, is it?
</P>
<P>
   Some of the titles are familiar: (beginitalic)The
Killers(enditalic) (1946), (beginitalic)Double Indemnity
(enditalic)(1944), (beginitalic)Out of the Past (enditalic)(1947).
They are gritty, atmospheric films with reluctant heroes, scheming
females and ambiguous endings. They were underproduced, perhaps as
Hollywood's reaction to its own excesses.
</P>
<P>
   (beginitalic)Blood Simple(enditalic), which touches all the
bases, gained a cult following through video rentals and gradually
became known as a classic. After the now-famous Coens opened the
door, Hollywood walked through it, cranking out more noir-type
movies, such as (beginitalic)The Last Seduction, Red Rock West
(enditalic)and the popular (beginitalic)L.A. Confidential.
</P>
<P>
   (enditalic)Some were faithful to the noir style, while others
were simply made to look like noir while copping out in the end. So
as you watch (beginitalic)Blood Simple(enditalic), here's a
checklist of what makes good noir:
</P>
<P>
   1) Low production values - These are not high-budget
productions, at least in terms of lighting and sets. For the
perfect template, take a look at (beginitalic)Detour
(enditalic)(1945), about a hitchhiker who takes a fatal wrong turn.
</P>
<P>
   2) The anti-hero - The main characters have to be slow on the
uptake (Burt Lancaster in (beginitalic)The Killers(enditalic)) or
at least disillusioned (Robert Mitchum in (beginitalic)Out of the
Past(enditalic)). They're not motivated by honor or duty, but by
greed or simply self-preservation.
</P>
<P>
   3) The femme fatale - Here's where (beginitalic)L.A.
Confidential (enditalic)loses it, with Kim Basinger as the hooker
with the heart of gold. Noir women are almost universally evil,
from the vicious Peggy Cummins in (beginitalic)Gun Crazy
(enditalic)to the diabolical Linda Fiorentino in (beginitalic)The
Last Seduction(enditalic).
</P>
<P>
   4) Plenty of double-crosses - You can't trust anybody in a noir
film, especially the people you're sleeping with. Just ask Fred
MacMurray, who was charmed by Barbara Stanwyck's anklet in
(beginitalic)Double Indemnity(enditalic).
</P>
<P>
   5) A strong crime element - Most of the best noir movies involve
private detectives or cops. There are some ((beginitalic)Sunset
Blvd., Lost Weekend(enditalic)) that stray more toward the
psychological, but trench coats and guns really help set the mood.
</P>
<P>
   6) No happy ending - The hero doesn't live, or at least doesn't
escape jail. Despite Hollywood's penchant for pat endings, the noir
hero rarely survives the film, either because he doesn't tumble to
the bushwhack or he turns out to be a stand-up guy after all.
</P>
<P>
   7) Snappy dialogue - Edward G. Robinson to MacMurray in
(beginitalic)Double Indemnity(enditalic): ``Guess I was wrong.
You're not smarter, Walter. You're just a little taller.''
</P>
<P>
   There you have it. So head for the video store, and then
(beginitalic)Blood Simple(enditalic), and you'll know your noir for
sure.

 &HT;    `BLOOD SIMPLE' STAR TALKS(a) 
 &HT;    (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)(a) 
 &HT;    (EMBARGOED UNTIL FRIDAY, AUG. 4. PLEASE DO NOT USE UNTIL
THEN)(a) 
 &HT;    By BILL MULLER(a) 
 &HT;    c.2000 The Arizona Republic(a) 
<TEXT>
<P>
   The Coen brothers scored a coup when they recruited M. Emmet
Walsh to star in their 1984 low-budget thriller, (beginitalic)Blood
Simple.
</P>
<P>
   (enditalic)After all, he was veteran actor. And he really knew
how to die.
</P>
<P>
   ``I did six movies one year, and they killed me in five of
them,'' Walsh said in an interview. ``I said, `Are they hiring me
because I'm talented, or because I give them a wide target?'''
</P>
<P>
   Walsh, 65, passed along his sage advice to another actor in
(beginitalic)Blood Simple(enditalic), which is being re-released on
the big screen Friday.
</P>
<P>
   ``I told (him) to die in a comfortable position,'' Walsh said.
``You're going to be there for three days. If you die in an awkward
position, they're going to have to keep going back to it, and
you're going to cramp.''
</P>
<P>
   If you've seen more than a few American movies, you've probably
seen Walsh, a noted character actor who has played a variety of
roles, from the deranged, can-shooting sniper in (beginitalic)The
Jerk (enditalic)to Harrison Ford's laconic boss in
(beginitalic)Blade Runner(enditalic).
</P>
<P>
   Walsh, who got his big break opposite Dustin Hoffman in
(beginitalic)Straight Time(enditalic), said he's always amazed at
how people remember his lines, like his graphic description of a
car accident in (beginitalic)Raising Arizona(enditalic), another
Coen brothers' movie.
</P>
<P>
   ``There was this spherical object in the road,'' Walsh's
character opines. ``And it wasn't a part of the car.''
</P>
<P>
   For (beginitalic)Blood Simple(enditalic), Walsh gave some
personal touches to his character, a seedy private detective who
favored yellow leisure suits and straw cowboy hats.
</P>
<P>
   As a metaphor, Walsh kept acting even as flies landed on him.
That was especially hard in one scene, which included some not so
freshly caught fish among the props.
</P>
<P>
   ``Your instinct is to swat (the flies). It just drove you
crazy,'' Walsh said. But rather than lose a take, ``I just let them
play.''
</P>
<P>
   Walsh didn't have much of a take on (beginitalic)Blood Simple
(enditalic)when the Coen brothers first called his agent in the
early '80s. Joel and Ethan Coen were green rookies. They couldn't
even pay him. Eventually, he agreed to do the movie for a small
percentage of the gross, not that he thought there would be any.
</P>
<P>
   ``The character was kind of fun,'' Walsh said. ``I thought, I'll
flesh this guy out, this Sydney Greenstreet type of thing, and in
seven or eight years somebody's going to offer me the character in
a real movie, and I'll have an idea how to play him.''
</P>
<P>
   Walsh, who was filming the Meryl Streep movie
(beginitalic)Silkwood (enditalic)in Dallas at the time, made the
trek back and forth to Austin, where (beginitalic)Blood Simple
(enditalic)was shooting.
</P>
<P>
   Walsh said the set was a riot. The director of photography,
Barry Sonnenfeld (who would go on to direct (beginitalic)Get Shorty
(enditalic)and (beginitalic)Men in Black(enditalic)) had never used
a 35mm camera before. Much of the prop and special effects work was
done by volunteers from the University of Texas.
</P>
<P>
   ``Every time you turned around, they were reinventing the
wheel,'' Walsh said. ``It was like, how do you put rain on a
windshield?''
</P>
<P>
   The Coens were stumped when it came time for Walsh's character
to blow smoke rings. Walsh, a non-smoker, tried without success.
The Coens brought in a machine, but it also failed.
</P>
<P>
   ``Finally, the assistant prop girl, this little Texas farm girl
says, `Give me that cigar. I grew up with five brothers, and we
spent all our time behind the barn.' She takes the cigar and blam,
she knocks out a smoke ring{hellip}I thought isn't this wonderful,
this is the way movies get made.''
</P>
<P>
   Walsh, who won an independent film award for his part in
(beginitalic)Blood Simple, (enditalic)admits he never expected the
movie to take off. At the time, he placed its chances as ``slim and
nil.''
</P>
<P>
   ``They weren't lucky, but they were lucky,'' he said of the
Coens. ``You can't be 27 and 29 years old and make a movie that
good.''
</P>
<P>
   In the end, it worked out better than Walsh ever expected.
</P>
<P>
   ``Every time the Coen brothers do a new movie, they talk about
(beginitalic)Blood Simple (enditalic)again and they talk about
me,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   So what do they ask?
</P>
<P>
   ``Is he dead?''

<P>
   NABLUS, West Bank _ It is summer camp time for 25,000
Palestinian teen-agers, and unusual camps they are, too. As run by
the men who handle psychological warfare for Yasser Arafat, the
Palestinian leader, they allow no horsing around in the dormitory,
no fun-in-the-sun by a cool lake, no rousing sing-along beside a
campfire.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, there is the chance to stage a mock kidnapping of an
Israeli leader by masked Palestinian commandos, ending with the
Israeli's bodyguards sprawled dead. Next, there is the mock attack
on an Israeli military post, ending with a sentry being fatally
stabbed. Finally, there is the opportunity to excel in stripping
and reassembling a Kalashnikov rifle.
</P>
<P>
   In the summer of the latest Camp David talks, a summer that was
supposed to produce a final peace settlement between Israel and its
Palestinian adversaries, the Palestinians' idea of a teen-age boys'
camp is a reminder of how deep old enmities run. At 90 two- and
three-week camps on the West Bank and in the Gaza Strip, youths
from towns and villages already ceded to Israel by Arafat's
Palestinian authority are learning the arts of kidnapping,
ambushing and using assault weapons.
</P>
<P>
   ``As President Arafat says, this is the generation that will
plant the Palestinian flag on the walls of Jerusalem,'' said Dr.
Wajieh Affouneh, a 49-year-old dental graduate who joined Arafat's
Fatah organization in a refugee camp, and in the 1970s and 1980s
participated, so other aides said, in some of the operations that
made the Palestinian cause synonymous with attacks on Israeli and
other targets. Affouneh is now a top man in the ``political
guidance'' department of Arafat's National Security Forces, the
armed police unit permitted under the Oslo accords.
</P>
<P>
   In the camps around this biblical town 35 miles north of
Jerusalem, the mood is a throwback to the days before Arafat joined
Israeli leaders in the peacemaking that faltered last week at Camp
David.
</P>
<P>
   In two weeks of talks, President Clinton was unable to bridge
the gap between the sides on crucial issues including Jerusalem,
Jewish settlements on the West Bank, the future borders of Israel
and a Palestinian state, and the fate of three million Palestinian
refugees dispersed around the Middle East.
</P>
<P>
   Since the current cycle of talks began in Oslo in 1993, both
sides have made generous use of the tactics of bluff and and have
still made impressive strides toward peace. But the display today
in the yard of what was once a notorious Israeli prison seemed more
than old-time propaganda, even if there was an element of that.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   To a visitor, what the youths and their mentors had prepared for
a graduation parade on Thursday appeared to be steeped more in the
Palestinian mindset of the 1970s than the conciliatory postures of
today.
</P>
<P>
   In the mock kidnapping acted out by the youths, an Israeli
politician or general _ precisely who was never made clear _ walked
across the old prison yard surrounded by eagle-eyed security men.
Suddenly a reporter approached with a tape recorder. The kidnap
target stopped, only to be grabbed by the reporter, now flourishing
an imitation pistol. As the VIP was dragged off, other mock
kidnappers shot seven of the supposed Israeli's bodyguards dead.
</P>
<P>
   For 1,000 Palestinian youngsters standing in neatly ordered
platoons, cheering, the enactments seemed like ripping good stuff.
</P>
<P>
   Afterward, many predicted that their generation would someday
take up arms against Israel over Jerusalem. At indoctrination
sessions in the camps, the youths have been told that Arafat, at
Camp David, rejected U.S. proposals that would have given the
Palestinian Authority a foothold in parts of Jerusalem, demanding
that Israel surrender the entire eastern half of the city it seized
in 1967.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Fikri Fouad, a 15-year-old village boy, said Palestinians had
learned during the Oslo peace process to live with a split view of
Israelis _ ``as people that we can make peace with, but still our
enemies, too.'' He added: ``If we can get Jerusalem without
weapons, it is better. But if there is a need to liberate Jerusalem
with weapons, we will be ready for that.''
</P>
<P>
   ``That's why we are being taught here to handle weapons,'' he
said, ``so that we can fight for our country if we have to.''
</P>
<P>
   Other youths offered opinions that would be grist for the mill
of Israeli politicians like Ariel Sharon, the hawkish former
general who has tried to stir a political groundswell against Prime
Minister Ehud Barak since Camp David by accusing him of endangering
Israel with his acceptance of U.S. proposals on Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
   At a news conference on Tuesday, Sharon, calling the city
``Israel's eternal and undivided capital,'' said any Palestinian
foothold there would encourage Arafat to press the ``real''
Palestinian goal of recovering Tel Aviv and Haifa, along with the
rest of Israel.
</P>
<P>
   Suleiman Nubaim, 16, said the Camp David talks had given new
relevance to what he and his friends had been taught about the
exploits of the freedom fighters, or ``fedayeen,'' the name taken
by Palestinian guerrillas of the pre-Oslo period. Like many youths,
he said he wanted to join the Palestinian forces.

 &HT;    Husband kills wife for refusing his advances
 &HT;    By Bill Montgomery
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Edward William Heckman's wife, Janet, was already dead
and buried in a shallow grave in their yard near Jonesboro, Ga. on
July 26 when he called a sister-in-law in Las Vegas and claimed his
wife had flown to Chicago, according to Clayton County police.
</P>
<P>
   But when Janet Heckman could not be reached in Chicago, where
her husband said she had gone to oversee repairs to a condo the
couple owned, her sister, Susan Pantle, called police Sunday,
Detective Todd Murphy said.
</P>
<P>
   Police then went to the couple's shaded ranch house to talk to
the husband, said Detective Sgt. Johnny Robinson.
</P>
<P>
   Heckman told police his wife of 37 years was out of town, and
officers initially found nothing suspicious, Robinson added. But
late Tuesday afternoon, Heckman, 64, confessed to killing his wife,
who would have turned 59 on Tuesday, with a hunting rifle after she
allegedly refused to have sex.
</P>
<P>
   Murphy said Edward Heckman told police that he and his wife
engaged in ``a shoving match'' on the bed when she rebuffed his
advances and that he reached for the rifle he kept under their bed.
``He says he kept it there for personal protection,'' Murphy added.
</P>
<P>
   Police have found no history of domestic violence in the
household, and neighbors said the couple kept to themselves and did
not socialize. ``It appears their problems revolved around sex, or
the lack of it,'' said Detective Scott Sperrazza.
</P>
<P>
   Robinson said Heckman had been arrested in the early 1990s in
Clayton County and Atlanta on charges of soliciting for
prostitution, but he could not provide any details of those
arrests.
</P>
<P>
   ``They pretty much kept to themselves and weren't very
neighborly people,'' said Paula Burnham, a college student spending
the summer with her mother next door to the couple's house.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've lived in the neighborhood for 19 years, and they were
here when we got here,'' Burnham added.
</P>
<P>
   After confessing to investigators, Heckman led police to a
3-foot-deep grave covered with brush and limbs next to the house,
Robinson said.
</P>
<P>
   The victim's body was wrapped in a blanket.
</P>
<P>
   ``He broke down and admitted to killing her about 9:30 p.m. last
Wednesday,'' Robinson said, adding that Heckman shot his wife in
the chest and head with a German-made Mauser rifle.
</P>
<P>
   Police dug up the grave on the south side of the house and found
Janet Heckman's body.
</P>
<P>
   The couple had no children, Robinson said.
</P>
<P>
   The Heckmans were already in the neighborhood of spacious,
tree-shaded brick homes when another neighbor, Jesse Newcomer,
arrived with his wife 11 years ago.
</P>
<P>
   ``He didn't speak much,'' Newcomer said. ``He told us when we
first came here that `We're real private people. We don't watch
what our neighbors do.' ''
</P>
<P>
   Heckman used to work for Eastern Airlines, Newcomer said, and
his wife ``worked in a lawyer's office, I think a paralegal or
something.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think the wife and I ever said a word to each other,''
Newcomer said. ``I'd see them driving out occasionally and she
would wave.''

BIG SHOTS CONQUER SPACE MOVIE
</HEADLINE>
  (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
 By ROBERT PHILPOT 
 c.2000 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   ``Space Cowboys'' is probably the closest we'll ever come to a
cinematic equivalent of Mount Rushmore. Not only are its four stars
_ Clint Eastwood, Tommy Lee Jones, Donald Sutherland and James
Garner _ iconic actors, but their craggy faces already seem to have
been carved out of granite. These are four men who've earned
respect; you expect them to be minted onto some commemorative coin.
</P>
<P>
   The actors, however, don't make the mistake of taking themselves
that seriously _ and for at least half its length, neither does
``Space Cowboys.'' The movie might seem to be the polar opposite of
another weekend opener, the young-female-bartenders-in-love
fandango ``Coyote Ugly,'' but the films do have one thing in
common: a lack of conviction in their own absurdity. Neither movie
is very plausible, yet at some point, each goes awry by beginning
to believe that its story could really happen.
</P>
<P>
   ``Space Cowboys' '' basic premise _ that four senior-citizen
astronauts would be recruited for an outer-space mission _ is
acceptable; after all, John Glenn set a precedent for this nearly
two years ago. Unlike Glenn, though, these guys have been waiting a
long time for their first trip; way back in 1958, when they were
hot-dogging test pilots (introduced in an entertaining,
black-and-white prologue), a chimpanzee usurped their opportunity
at a space mission. Eastwood's character, Frank Corvin, has been
ticked off about it ever since.
</P>
<P>
   But now it's the present, and an aging, wounded Soviet satellite
threatens to topple toward Earth unless someone can work out the
bugs in a device that Corvin designed. Naturally, he's a little
suspicious that his technology wound up on a mysterious Soviet
satellite during the height of the Cold War, but he passively
accepts the explanations for this. When he's called on to help fix
the gizmo, he insists that he be sent into space to do the job,
along with his old crewmates who were gypped by the chimp.
</P>
<P>
   Eastwood, who also directed, has a good time with this, as
Corvin travels out to assemble his posse: preacher Tank Sullivan
(Garner), roller-coaster designer Jerry O'Neil (Sutherland), and
stunt pilot/longtime rival Hawk Hawkins (Tommy Lee Jones). Each is
reintroduced in vignettes that are blessed with rowdy,
self-deprecating humor, as is most of the first half of the movie,
which puts the four through the training paces they need for flying
the space shuttle.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, they learn to fly the thing in a month, and that's a
little hard to swallow, but the movie's air of self-mockery helps
blow by that little plot flaw. Ken Kaufman and Howard Klausner's
screenplay provides plenty of hints at duplicity on the part of
NASA weasel Bob Gerson (James Cromwell), who burned Corvin and his
team back in 1958 and seems likely to do so again. And a sweet
romance begins to develop between mission director Sara Holland
(Marcia Gay Harden) and Jones' character. The screenplay also has
many amusing, off-color and/or macho moments _ and then the darn
thing has to turn serious on us.
</P>
<P>
   It's when the movie goes into space that it takes on its
gravity, providing a change in tone and plot twists that we won't
reveal here. This shift might be OK, except that the second half is
even harder to buy into than the first _ even the laziest
fourth-grade science-fair slacker might have trouble dealing with
the explanations and solutions on display here. This has been a
problem with many of Eastwood's recent starring movies. He's
willing to toy with his feel-lucky-punk image, but only to a point,
and that seems to cloud his vision of the movies' ridiculousness.
``Space Cowboys'' is at least a little more self-aware of its
silliness than ``True Crime,'' perhaps 1999's most preposterous
movie, and 1997's nearly as absurd
cat-burglar-catches-president-with-his-pants-down flick ``Absolute
Power.'' But ``Space Cowboys'' becomes less fun when it gets down
to business.
</P>
<P>
   It's hard to dislike it, though, because of its cast. Eastwood
gets more than enough chances to squint and hiss one-liners; the
guy has been breaking rules for more than 40 years, long before
``Dirty Harry'' was losing count of how many shots he fired, and
he's still a joy to watch when he clicks. Jones, more cheerful,
open and good-ol'-boy than he has been in a while, proves to be an
apt foil for Eastwood; when they brawl, it brings to mind the
good-natured machismo of the fistfights in John Wayne's more
lighthearted movies.
</P>
<P>
   Sutherland and Garner have less to do, but each does it with
laconic ease, barely breaking a sweat as they reduce the movie's
younger actors (Loren Dean and Courtney B. Vance as fellow
astronauts) from supporting status to background wallpaper. All
four leads look like they're having the time of their long careers,
and their attitude is contagious. You could spend an evening
picking this movie apart, right down to the beautiful lunacy of its
closing shot, but the good vibes emanating from the cast make all
kvetching irrelevant.

FX-CELLENCE ASIDE, THIS `MAN' LOOKS VERY FAMILIAR

<TEXT>
<P>
   It doesn't take a formula for invisibility to see right through
director Paul Verhoeven's violent, sexy and occasionally clever
special-effects showcase, ``Hollow Man.''
</P>
<P>
   Despite all its promises of genuine chills combined with saying
something about the effects that invisibility might have on the
human psyche, it's really just the same old stuff we've come to
expect from Verhoeven: special FX laid on so thick they come just
short of ceasing to be special; graphic, bloody and over-the-top
violence; and the unapologetic exploitation of naked flesh.
</P>
<P>
   Now don't get me wrong, I don't necessarily have a problem with
any of those things. After all, I loved Verhoeven's menacing giant
bug movie, ``Starship Troopers.'' What I do mind is squandering a
nifty premise while giving audiences the old bait-and-switch;
commercials bill ``Hollow Man'' as some kind of stylish new
approach to a Hollywood cliche instead of what it really is,
``Friday the 13th Part Whatever: Jason Disappears.''
</P>
<P>
   But for all its faults, you certainly can't blame star Kevin
Bacon. As self-centered genius Sebastian Caine, Bacon oozes cocky
villainy. He makes almost as much of a largely faceless role as
Claude Rains did in James Whale's 1933 classic ``The Invisible
Man.'' Suffice it to say Rains didn't have to deliver a performance
while enduring the kind of FX-oriented torture Bacon experienced.
</P>
<P>
   As the head of a secret Pentagon-funded research group, along
with project chiefs Linda (Elisabeth Shue, as his feisty ex-wife)
and Matthew (Josh Brolin, as her new secret lover), the
megalomaniacal Caine plots to keep the success of the invisibility
formula's animal testing from the military in order to leap right
to human testing. And you can guess who the first eager volunteer
to pull a disappearing act might be.
</P>
<P>
   But as any Hollywood experiment in mad science has taught us
(not to mention almost every other invisible man movie), something
goes ``horribly'' wrong. Caine disappears all right, but it's the
reappearing that proves to be the tricky part.
</P>
<P>
   And it doesn't take long before the lure of his awesome new
power, combined with the drug's side effect of increased aggressive
tendencies, leads Caine to try just about anything, including the
extermination of his team, to keep his secret.
</P>
<P>
   Let's be honest. As with most movies dealing with invisibility,
the thing that attracts audiences is special effects, and on that
front, ``Hollow Man'' doesn't disappoint. Apart from the expected
shots of empty clothes and footprint indentations in the carpet,
expect a new twist on the old bandaged head treatment, along with a
startlingly gruesome approach to clearing out. You see, the process
works from the outside in, offering a somewhat grisly ``visible
man'' anatomy lesson as the formula works its way through the
bloodstream.
</P>
<P>
   As for the film's remarkably bloody pick-'em-off-one-at-a-time
finale, we might have suggested a better motto than, ``The gore the
merrier.'' How 'bout, ``Less is more?''
</P>
<P>

GENERAL MOTORS TO BATTLE FORD ON FUEL ECONOMY FOR SPORT UTILITY
VEHICLES

<TEXT>
<P>
   PONTIAC, Mich. _ General Motors challenged Ford Wednesday to a
battle over which company can deliver bigger improvements in fuel
economy, particularly for sport utility vehicles, the least
efficient vehicles of all.
</P>
<P>
   Ford committed itself last week to an improvement of 25 percent,
or almost 5 miles per gallon from approximately 18 mpg now, as the
average for its sport utility vehicles over the next five years.
General Motors announced Wednesday that no matter how much Ford
improved the energy efficiency of its sport utilities by 2005, GM's
sport utilities would average even more miles to the gallon by
then.
</P>
<P>
   The announcements affect half of all the sport utilities sold in
the country _ about 800,000 by each automaker.
</P>
<P>
   GM also upped the ante, saying that the overall fuel economy for
all its light trucks _ a category including minivans and pickups as
well as sport utilities _ would be better than Ford's in 2005.
</P>
<P>
   ``GM will still be the leader in five years, and in 15 years for
that matter,'' said Harry Pearce, GM's vice chairman, at a news
conference Wednesday in this Detroit suburb.
</P>
<P>
   Ford had said last week that it would improve the fuel economy
of its minivans and pickups, and planned future announcements to
say by how much after performing additional engineering studies.
Pearce's comments Wednesday effectively pre-empted Ford's next
move, by committing GM to exceed in average light truck fuel
economy whatever Ford does. The world's two largest automakers make
nearly half the nation's minivans and pickup trucks.
</P>
<P>
   Automakers have been trumpeting the occasional fuel-economy
improvement in various models for years, but have typically offset
these gains by making other vehicles more powerful and less
efficient. The GM and Ford announcements mark the first time that
big domestic automakers have committed themselves voluntarily to
significant increases in the average fuel economy of large classes
of vehicles.
</P>
<P>
   Why, after two decades of no significant improvement in the fuel
economy of light trucks, are GM and Ford reversing course? Both
companies said their market research had found growing interest in
better fuel economy.
</P>
<P>
   Foreign automakers are stepping up their sales of sport
utilities and showing that they do not have to be gas guzzlers,
partly because the foreign brands are often based on lightweight
car underbodies instead of cheap but heavy pickup truck
underbodies. GM and Ford also worry that the government might
require higher fuel economy; the automakers helped narrowly defeat
such a plan in Congress two months ago.
</P>
<P>
   But another big reason for GM's declaration seemed to be a
nervousness that last week's news conference by Ford had burnished
Ford's reputation for environmental responsibility, which might
help Ford sell more cars and light trucks. ``What annoys me is the
perception that seems to come from that press conference that Ford
is somehow the environmental leader,'' Pearce said.
</P>
<P>
   Jacques Nasser, Ford's chief executive, said last week that the
planned improvement in fuel economy would save the typical sport
utility customer about 1,700 gallons of gasoline, or 80 trips to
the gas station, over the first 10 years of vehicle ownership. The
effect on the nation's overall oil imports and emissions of global
warming gases, while small at first, would grow as the more
efficient models gradually replace the behemoths now on the road.
</P>
<P>
   DaimlerChrysler and Asian automakers declined to join Ford and
GM in promising fuel-economy gains, saying that they already had
better gas mileage, partly because they did not sell models as big
as the Ford Excursion and GM's Chevrolet Suburban. ``We'll let them
do the tit for tat,'' said Michael Aberlich, a DaimlerChrysler
spokesman.

 PONTIAC, Mich.: DaimlerChrysler spokesman. 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Michael Love, Toyota's national regulatory affairs manager, said
the Japanese automaker would focus on the gas mileage of individual
models. ``We'll try to have class-leading fuel economy in every
segment we're in,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Environmentalists hailed GM's position. ``That's huge _ Ford
placed its bet and GM anted up and we've got a real race here,''
said Jason Mark, the transportation co-director at the Union of
Concerned Scientists.
</P>
<P>
   Like Ford last week, GM said Wednesday that it would improve
fuel economy without resorting to the auto industry's favorite
loopholes in the 1990s: Building vehicles so heavy that they are
exempt from federal fuel-economy rules, and claiming gas mileage
credits for vehicles that have the capability to burn either
gasoline or nearly pure ethanol, even though ethanol is not
available in most of the country. GM also said that, like Ford, it
would achieve almost all of its improvement through changes in
conventional, gasoline-powered engines, rather than by switching to
potentially dirty diesel engines or introducing partly electric
engines for which consumer demand is unclear.
</P>
<P>
   GM provided more technical details than Ford, saying it planned
to change all of its big V-8 engines over the next several years to
use a technology tried in desperation and abandoned during the
depths of the oil crisis that followed the Iranian revolution in
1979. The technology involves turning off four of the engine's
eight cylinders except when maximum power is needed for
acceleration or towing.
</P>
<P>
   This approach was discredited when GM tried it in the early
1980s because the engine controls then were slow to sense changes
in the driver's need for power, so there was a long lag when
drivers tried to accelerate. The latest microprocessors adjust the
number of cylinders in use faster than a human being can appreciate
the change, said Stephen G. Poulos, a GM engineer.
</P>
<P>
   GM also said it would introduce in some of its light trucks a
technology known as a continuously variable transmission. This
replaces a conventional four-speed automatic transmission, and is
in use on a few very small cars, mainly overseas. But the
technology, for which drivers do not sense any gear changes at all,
has been improving lately for use on larger vehicles.
</P>
<P>
   Pearce also displayed a large pickup truck and a city bus that
were each powered by a hybrid system of a gasoline engine and an
electric motor. The hybrid pickup truck will be 15 percent more
fuel efficient than current models and the hybrid bus will be 50
percent more efficient. Many electric vehicle enthusiasts say that
even bigger efficiency gains will be possible, and that hybrid
systems could someday reduce considerably the nation's energy
needs.
</P>
<P>
   But GM is concerned that customers may take a while to accept
hybrids as household vehicles, and is not counting on hybrids to
play more than a very small part in its overall improvement in
light truck fuel economy by 2005, said Jeffrey Kuhlman, a GM
spokesman.
</P>
<P>
   Pearce said GM's current sport utilities go 6 percent farther
than Ford's on a gallon of gasoline, on average. He did not promise
that GM would beat Ford by a similar percentage in 2005, raising
the possibility that GM could keep the lead but improve its fuel
economy by a little less than Ford's 25 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Ford officials said they were unsure whether GM's current sport
utilities were ahead in fuel economy. In midmodel year reports to
regulators on the 2000 model year, GM and Ford have both reported
that their light truck fleets are averaging 20.9 mpg.
</P>
<P>
   But Ford welcomed GM's overall willingness to compete on fuel
economy. ``It's good for the ecology, it's good for the customer,''
said Ken Zino, a Ford spokesman.
</P>
<P>
   Pearce, who has overseen public policy and technology issues at
GM for four years, mentioned repeatedly Wednesday his irritation at
the attention that Ford had received for its commitment to greater
fuel economy at a news conference in Washington last week. He
chided Nasser, Ford's chief executive, for having flown to
Washington to make his announcement at the National Press Club.
``We've got them beat in SUVs and they know it, and maybe that's
why they felt compelled to be in the Press Club,'' he said,
speaking at GM's Truck Design Center here.

<TEXT>
<P>
   PHILADELPHIA _ Just six years ago, when George W. Bush ran for
governor of Texas, even his parents expected him to lose.
</P>
<P>
   It was his younger brother Jeb who held the family's confidence
and aspirations, who had diligently prepared for his bid to become
governor of Florida in 1994. George W., in contrast, had come to
his ambitions haphazardly, and his mother, Barbara, flatly tried to
discourage his seemingly quixotic resolve. Friends and family
members say that the elder Bushes worried that George W. would be
forced to bow again, as he had several times before, to failure.
</P>
<P>
   But that story had a surprise ending: while Jeb lost, George
won. And in the process, George Walker Bush launched himself,
without any grand plan or intricate forethought, on a trajectory
that on Thursday will place him in the spotlight here as the
Republican nominee for president, continuing along what historians
may some day recall as a most remarkable path to the White House.
</P>
<P>
   Bush is almost an accidental candidate, a cocky and cheerful
fellow who drifted through much of his life and who was largely
unknown in America until he assumed his first political office five
and a half years ago. Yet he now leads the polls and will have, if
elected, one of the thinnest resumes in public service of any
president in the last century.
</P>
<P>
   Bush's exceptional trajectory also means that he remains a
riddle wrapped in layers of paradox. It would be too much to
describe him as the Republican Party's blind date, but there still
is a great deal about his beliefs and leadership style _ about the
kind of president he would be _ that remains unknown.
</P>
<P>
   He is a man who sometimes tortures the English language,
puzzling audiences with references to the ``vile'' hemisphere
(instead of ``vital'') and tailpipe ``admissions'' (``emissions''),
and mystifying a group of New Hampshire schoolchildren during
Perseverance Month when he earnestly counseled them, ``You've got
to preserve,'' as if they should all rush out to can tomatoes.
</P>
<P>
   Yet he has a dazzling charm, tremendous social skills, a bold
self-confidence, growing political savvy, great popularity among
the Texans who know him best _ and a past littered with opponents
who underestimated him. Those who have worked with Bush, Democrats
as well as Republicans, mostly say that contrary to all the jokes,
he is smart, shrewd and a quick study.
</P>
<P>
   The paradoxes go on. He is the law-and-order candidate, the
amiable governor who presides over a stream of executions, the
preacher of traditional moral values, the mover behind a convention
that called for giving young people the ``moral strength'' to
resist drugs. And yet he was arrested twice in college for pranks,
and he avoided military service in Vietnam, abused alcohol and
dances around questions in ways that suggest that he used illegal
drugs himself.
</P>
<P>
   He steers a profoundly conservative path. And yet he can startle
lily-white Republican audiences full of stout women in pearls with
sympathetic remarks about Mexican immigrants.
</P>
<P>
   He is the ultimate outsider candidate, dripping with scorn about
the ways of Washington and disdainful of Ivy League institutions,
always deeply proud of his frontier roots in the rattlesnake
country of Midland, Texas. And he is the ultimate insider
candidate, a Yale and Harvard graduate whose Rolodex brims with the
names of corporate and political titans, and blue-blooded enough
that even as a little boy he realized on a visit to his relatives
that his best friend should not have drunk from the fingerbowls.
</P>
<P>
   Like most Republicans, he rejects quotas used for affirmative
action as unfair. Yet he never complained about the fairness of
preferences that in the 1950s helped boys like him get into high
schools like Andover or colleges like Yale, because their fathers
had gone there before. Judging from his high school grades and
college board scores, he almost certainly would not have been
accepted at Yale without his family ties.
</P>
<P>
   Better than virtually any other politician in America today,
Bush reflects Kipling's ideal _ ``If you can talk with crowds and
keep your virtue, or walk with kings _ nor lose the common touch.''
He has already hobnobbed with Queen Elizabeth II and gets along
equally brilliantly with beer-bellied baseball fans; he would be a
gold medalist in small talk if it were an Olympic sport. Yet he is
the scion of one of America's most prominent political families.
</P>
<P>
   (The word ``dynasty'' is taboo around the Bushes, arousing such
annoyance that its mention sometimes turns Bush's charm congealing
into something close to icy fury. But Bush is a direct descendant
of President Franklin Pierce on his mother's side and of a more
recent president on his father's side.)
</P>
<P>
   He is exceptionally casual and unpretentious, sometimes goofy.
When mealtime approached recently on his campaign plane, the flight
attendant handed him a small piping-hot towel, and he did what
passengers typically do, rubbing his fingers and mouth. But then he
unfolded the towel, draped it over his face and leaned toward the
person next to him as if playing peek-a-boo.
</P>
<P>
   Where, oh where, was the Republican presidential candidate?
Hiding beneath a soggy square of terrycloth, as he pursued an
office that embodies gravitas and dignity.
</P>
<P>
   Always quick to lampoon bigwigs, Bush used to entertain friends
with splendidly cruel impressions of some of his father's more
haughty cabinet members. And now this man who delights in deflating
important people may himself become the most important person in
the world.

SPEEDY GOODWIN HELPS DODGERS ROLL
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By BRIAN DOHN  
 c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   PITTSBURGH _ Todd Hollandsworth made his presence felt Tuesday
for Colorado. Tom Goodwin took his turn Wednesday afternoon at
Three Rivers Stadium, and he showed why the Dodgers wanted him.
</P>
<P>
   Goodwin, the speedy leadoff batter Dodgers manager Davey Johnson
sought, reached base in each of the first four innings as the
Dodgers built an eight-run lead and cruised to an 11-5 victory over
the Pirates.
</P>
<P>
   Goodwin walked three times, added a base hit, scored twice,
drove in two runs, stole a base and took the extra base when the
opportunity arose.
</P>
<P>
   ``You just try to get on base, but the hard part is what the
other guys do,'' Goodwin said. ``They have to get the clutch hits,
and make the contact and all that.''
</P>
<P>
   The Dodgers (57-50) concluded their 10-game road trip 6-4 and
they've won five of their last six series. They played the last
three games in a 24-hour span, winning the final two.
</P>
<P>
   ``What a game for Goodwin,'' Johnson said. ``That's as good as
it gets. His first four (plate appearances), you talk about
sparking the club. I think both guys were covering (second) at one
time. That's what speed does. It forces the defense to move around.
He took the extra base.''
</P>
<P>
   Goodwin was the centerpiece of the Dodgers' win, but he was far
from the only offensive force. Shawn Green hit a three-run homer
off Pirates starter Jose Silva (7-5) to give the Dodgers a 3-0 lead
three batters into the game.
</P>
<P>
   Alex Cora ended his torrid road trip with three more hits and
four RBI. Cora, whose lackluster offense has held him back, went 11
for 24 (.453) with 11 RBI in the 10-game trip, raising his average
to .271. He entered the trip without an RBI in a month.
</P>
<P>
   Also, right-hander Darren Dreifort (8-7) won his fourth
consecutive start and improved to 4-0 since the All-Star break,
though this outing wasn't as dominant as his previous two. Dreifort
had his scoreless-innings streak snapped at 19 when he surrendered
a one-out, two-run homer to Alex Ramirez in the second inning.
</P>
<P>
   But buoyed by 11 runs in the first four innings, Dreifort didn't
need to be particularly sharp. He allowed five runs on seven hits
in six innings.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think I got caught up with being too patient,'' Cora said.
``I know I have to put the ball in play. Right now, I'm getting
into a situation where I'm hitting what I want to hit, not what
they want me to hit.''
</P>
<P>
   Goodwin, who went 0 for 4 with three strikeouts and a walk in
his Dodgers debut, showed his dazzling speed in the first inning
when he went from first to third on Mark Grudzielanek's single to
left. Green followed with his 18th homer of the season.
</P>
<P>
   In the second inning, Goodwin walked and moved to third when
Pirates left fielder John Vander Wal misplayed Grudzielanek's
single. The Dodgers went ahead 5-0 when Goodwin scored on Gary
Sheffield's sacrifice fly.
</P>
<P>
   And Goodwin's speed and aggressiveness on the basepaths rubbed
off on his teammates, especially in the third, when Dave Hansen and
Cora scored on Goodwin's infield single. Goodwin's high chopper
went over the pitcher's mound and off shortstop Enrique Wilson's
glove. Cora never stopped running and scored from second to put the
Dodgers ahead 8-3.
</P>
<P>
   ``I looked back and saw (Wilson) missed it, and I'm a middle
infielder so I know how it works over there,'' Cora said. ``You
have to take advantage, and when he missed it you have to pick up
the ball and make a perfect throw. Everything has to go right to
get an out, so you stay aggressive and I scored.'' &QL;

 PHILADELPHIA: the world. 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BY NATURE, NOT A POLITICAL PERSON &QL;
</P>
<P>
   It is too early to resolve these paradoxes with any certainty,
and Bush, somebody positively allergic to what he dismisses as
``psychobabble,'' is not much help in this. But it may be possible
to venture a few useful clues.
</P>
<P>
   One is that Bush is _ and perhaps always has been _ more of a
``people person'' than a political person. In high school and
college, he always sought to be the center of attention but showed
no interest in political debate. Marlin Fitzwater, who was
President Bush's spokesman, says that in the late 1980s and early
'90s, when he saw the Bush children at the family retreat in
Kennebunkport, Maine, or in Washington, young George was amiable,
but far from political.
</P>
<P>
   ``George W. almost never showed interest in politics or
policy,'' Fitzwater recalled. ``I can't remember us ever talking
about policy, in fact. In those days, he was in the oil business in
Midland, at first, and then involved in baseball, and so we would
talk about that or we'd chat about what was in the newspaper or
about sports.''
</P>
<P>
   Fitzwater added: ``George W. was so apolitical in the way he
approached the presidency and the family that I was shocked when he
ran for governor.''
</P>
<P>
   That may overstate the case, for Bush has been around politics
since he helped his father campaign for the Senate in 1970 (giving
such good pep talks, remembers Anson Franklin, then an aide to his
father, that some people even then said he was a better speaker
than his father). But when he helped his father run for the Senate,
or later for president, he seemed impelled more by love and loyalty
than by passion about the issues. Friends say that when he ran
unsuccessfully for the House of Representatives in 1978, he was
motivated not by deep-seated ideological convictions but by the
thought that it would be cool to be a congressman.
</P>
<P>
   In adulthood, one of the best ways to be in the spotlight and
get the loudest laughs for your jokes is to be successful in
politics, and Bush has seemingly drifted toward that spotlight less
because of bedrock political beliefs than because he enjoys it and
is good at it. But there is also something more: the pressure to
uphold his family legacy of public service and the expectations it
created.
</P>
<P>
   ``He admired his father tremendously and wanted to live up to
the expectations that his family had for him and for all members,''
recalled Ted Livingston, a roommate at Yale.
</P>
<P>
   This Bush legacy offers another clue to understanding him. Deep
in the family aristocratic tradition there is a commitment to
public service that is easy to mock as a version of the white man's
burden _ a sort of Bushes' burden. One of Bush's early heroes was
his grandfather, Prescott Bush, an impossibly tall, impossibly
severe financier who would have died rather than kiss a baby. Yet
Prescott Bush subjected himself to the indignity of electioneering
to be elected senator. A Republican, he was pragmatic and
nondoctrinaire in much the same way as his grandson, and he became
one of the first senators to denounce Joseph McCarthy.
</P>
<P>
   Herbert S. Parmet, a historian and biographer of President Bush,
said he believed that the younger Bush's political career arose
from that family legacy honoring public service. His political
flexibility, his talk of inclusiveness and his speeches about
``compassionate conservatism'' all reflect Bush family values,
Parmet said.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's easy to ridicule,'' he acknowledged. ``But it comes out
of the family, out of noblesse oblige and all that.''
</P>
<P>
   OPERATING ON INSTINCT RATHER THAN INTELLECT
</P>
<P>
   Another clue is that in place of an ideology, Bush seems to have
something milder and sketchier _ call it instinct. It is not rigid
or deeply partisan, and its essence is to incline toward
pro-business policies, tax cuts and limited government. In recent
years, Bush has fleshed it out a bit more, relying upon right-wing
thinkers and writers like Marvin Olasky and Myron Magnet, who have
written books harshly criticizing 1960s liberalism and the welfare
state. In a note to Magnet, Bush praised him for having ``charged
our intellectual batteries.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, these batteries often seem like AAAs. Bush is
determinedly anti-intellectual, gives little evidence of having
thought out a political philosophy, waffles on many issues and
often jokes about his fondness for reading the executive summary
and skipping the long report. All this means that he is not exactly
a blank slate, but a relatively illegible one.
</P>
<P>
   The famous pop quiz that he flunked last year, about foreign
leaders, may have been silly in some respects, but it perhaps got
at something deeper: this is a man who is often casual about
geopolitical information, and it is another way in which he is an
unusual and sometimes awkward candidate. Bush seems deeply out of
sync with America's elite, dismissive of its icons and ignorant of
what it regards as essential information.
</P>
<P>
   Left to his own devices, on his campaign plane, Bush talks more
about his pets than his proposals. When heading back home to Austin
after a campaign trip, he talked about his upcoming weekend.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'll be reading policy,'' he declared with an exaggerated and
mock seriousness. Then he grinned and admitted, ``No, I'll probably
take a few naps.''
</P>
<P>
   Yet some of his advisers say that all this places him in greater
touch with the American heartland.
</P>
<P>
   To understand the world around him, Bush reaches first not for
policy papers but for his Bible. He says he reads it every day.
When asked to name his favorite philosopher-thinker, he simply
replied: ``Christ, because he changed my heart.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush does not wear his Methodist faith on his sleeve, does not
thump on his Bible and is reluctant to talk about his views on
evolution _ but his religious beliefs are an important part of who
he is.
</P>
<P>
   If Bush has an ideology, it is personal, not political; it is
simply loyalty. It is a deep loyalty to his father and to friends
who have stood by him and his family. Many of his top aides have
been friends for many years or decades, and loyalty was again a
subtext when Bush chose as his running mate Dick Cheney, the
defense secretary under President Bush. The Texas governor was not
merely going to restore honor and integrity to the White House, as
he pledged in many a stump speech. He was going to reunite the
personnel.

 PHILADELPHIA: the personnel. 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BENEATH A SIMPLE EXTERIOR, A SKILLFUL POLITICIAN
</P>
<P>
   Bush often seems an echo of Prince Hal, the likable but
dissolute son of King Henry IV in Shakespeare's plays. Hal sobers
up when he inherits the crown as Henry V _ and ultimately becomes a
model leader who is a better ruler for his past wildness. One of
the most interesting questions about Bush is whether he will grow
in the same way.
</P>
<P>
   Certainly there are signs that he has matured. For much of his
life, his awesome people skills were undermined by his volatile
temper, his sharp tongue, his tendency to hold grudges. But when he
ran for governor in 1994, his opponent, Ann Richards, thought it
would be easy to goad him into losing his cool and humiliating
himself; instead he surprised friends and rivals alike with his
steadiness under pressure and a newfound discipline.
</P>
<P>
   That discipline and self-restraint have been evident in a taut
campaign this year, in which Bush kept his temper in check and
relentlessly stayed ``on message.'' After a divisive primary
season, he managed better than many had expected to unite the
Republican Party and get what he wanted in this convention.
</P>
<P>
   Central to this political success is his campaign style. Bush's
years as a farmer of wild oats left him with a down-to-earth manner
that resonates with voters in a way his father's and grandfather's
styles never quite did.
</P>
<P>
   ``I never thought of myself as a bad campaigner,'' President
Bush mused in a recent interview. ``After all, I was elected
president of the United States. And I like people and all. But I
think George is better.''
</P>
<P>
   Friends of the family overwhelmingly second that. Indeed, the
very things that critics often denounce in George W., such as his
anti-intellectualism and uninterest in policy details, come across
to many voters as an unpretentiousness and fundamental likability
that are his greatest political strengths.
</P>
<P>
   One aspect of Bush's personality that irritates his critics and
endears him to his supporters is that he seems to have a mere
human-sized ambition. One sometimes gets the sense that Vice
President Al Gore wanted to be president from second grade; little
Georgie wanted to be a major league baseball player.
</P>
<P>
   Bush has always put a priority on having a good time. Of his
schoolbook Latin, the phrase that he summons from memory is,
characteristically: ``ubi, ubi sububi.'' It is a sophomoric pun,
which he translates as: ``Where, oh where, is your underwear?''
</P>
<P>
   Even now, Bush balances his ambition with his desire for
comfort. It is important to him; he carries his own feather pillow
on the road, goes out of his way to vow that the couches will be
``comfortable'' in the house he is building on his Texas ranch.
</P>
<P>
   ``During the Democrat convention, it's traditional for a
candidate to go out of the news, which I plan to do,'' Bush mused
recently. ``We started thinking about a lot of places to go. I
said, `I want to go to my own place, my own bed, my own house, my
own dog.' So that's what I'm going to do.''
</P>
<P>
   Of course, for most of his life Bush had little reason to be
pretentious. Until the late 1980s, he was simply a struggling
oilman in Texas, albeit the son of the vice president, and his
career took off mostly after he became a part-owner of the Texas
Rangers baseball team in 1989, and then was elected governor of
Texas in 1994.
</P>
<P>
   His name and connections helped him, of course, and without them
it is difficult to imagine that he would be a candidate today (a
proposition that Bush does not really argue with, although he hates
to talk about it).
</P>
<P>
   But Bush's underdog victory as governor did not seem to be a
harbinger at first; ``Bush'' was then a four-letter word in many
Republican circles, a reminder of a president who had broken his
no-new-taxes pledge and surrendered the White House after one term
to those exasperating Clintons.
</P>
<P>
   But then Governor Bush was re-elected in 1998 with an
astonishing 69 percent of the vote, and his fortunes soared. He
became the great Republican hope, the money poured in, and he was
crowned as the presidential front-runner.
</P>
<P>
   There was a bumpy stretch in the primaries after Sen. John
McCain won in New Hampshire, but within six weeks Bush had
recovered his footing. He has been almost constantly ahead of Al
Gore ever since.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps it is this front-runner status, or more likely a trait
ingrained since childhood, but Bush campaigns as an utter stranger
to self-doubt. He seems certain that he will win. One result is
that he reaches out to formidable policy advisers; he does not seem
to worry that he will look ignorant in comparison _ or, more
searchingly, that he should, like them, devote himself more
energetically to understanding the world.
</P>
<P>
   This self-confidence can also breed trouble. He is so sure of
himself, his own good intentions and the prospect that people will
see him as he wants to be seen, that he is often perceived as
arrogant. His confidence can also lead him to stumble.
</P>
<P>
   When he spoke at Bob Jones University in the primary season,
despite its founder's record of anti-Catholic comments and the
school's notorious reputation for racism, he seemed unprepared for
the fallout and taken aback by it. He assumes that he should be
judged inclusive for his willingness to speak to the National
Association for the Advancement of Colored People, rather than
exclusive and insensitive for his speech at Bob Jones.
</P>
<P>
   Likewise, he seemed surprised that people would see his pick of
Cheney, a rich, white relic of his father's administration, as
contradicting his portrayal of himself as a fresh voice, an
outsider, an agent of a new inclusiveness in the Republican Party.
</P>
<P>
   Bush's self-confidence leaves him one of the least neurotic
people on the planet, and also one of the least inclined to examine
himself. He glides along, glibly and optimistically, confident that
his innate cleverness will make up for whatever else he lacks,
deliberately ignoring the slings and arrows of his outrageous good
fortune.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't read half of what you write,'' he told the press corps
on his campaign plane last month, in a bit of pregnant banter
suffused with equal parts defiance and mischievous charm.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't listen to half of what you say,'' one of the
reporters shot back.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's apparent,'' Bush replied, never missing a beat, ``in
the other half of what I read.''

NADER BLASTS GOP AND DEMOCRATIC CONVENTIONS AS `POLITICAL ORGIES' &HT;    By TIMOTHY SPENCE
 &HT;    c.2000 Hearst Newspapers
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHILADELPHIA _ Presidential candidate Ralph Nader on Wednesday
denounced the Republican and Democratic conventions as
corporate-paid ``political orgies'' and dismissed criticism that he
will siphon votes from Vice President Al Gore.
</P>
<P>
   Nader, the Green Party candidate, unleashed his
anti-establishment offensive at two separate appearances across
town from the GOP convention, where Republicans were poised to
nominate Texas Gov. George W. Bush for president and former defense
secretary and oil industry executive Dick Cheney as his running
mate.
</P>
<P>
   The Republican national convention is costing some $63 million,
of which about $50 million was contributed by businesses and
individuals.
</P>
<P>
   Nader aimed some of his harshest criticism at Gore and other
Democrats, accusing them of abandoning the party's traditional core
_ workers and lower-income people _ and of co-opting Republican
issues under President Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Democrats are decaying from within,'' he said in an
interview. The party is ``a shell of what it once was.''
</P>
<P>
   Appearing in a city brimming with galas, tours and receptions
for Republican delegates and politicians, many of the events
sponsored by corporations, Nader said the national political
conventions exclude most working Americans.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a political carnival where the political powers shake
down the corporations and the corporations buy future political
favors,'' Nader said of the GOP convention, adding that it would be
the ``same in Los Angeles'' where the Democrats hold their
nominating convention beginning Aug. 14.
</P>
<P>
   Polls have shown Nader gaining among liberal Democrats and
environmentalists, especially in key Western and Midwestern states.
He has picked up support from rank-and-file members of organized
labor who are upset over the Clinton administration's support for
normalized trade relations with China.
</P>
<P>
   Gore officials, meanwhile, have said the interest in Nader is a
fluke that will dissipate as the November election nears.
</P>
<P>
   Nationwide polls show Nader winning about 7 percent of voters in
a four-way race against Gore, Bush and Pat Buchanan, the nominee of
the Reform Party. A recent poll shows Nader garnering 9 percent in
California, a must-win state for Gore.
</P>
<P>
   The Green Party hopes to have Nader on the ballot in 45 states
by election day, Nov. 7.
</P>
<P>
   Nader's withering criticism of Clinton and Gore has prompted
some Democrats to accuse the Green Party candidate of taking votes
away from Gore. Nader's liberal agenda calls for national health
insurance, restrictions on corporate donations to politicians,
taxes on stock purchases and more governmental protection of the
environment.
</P>
<P>
   Nader, responding to a reporter's question, denied that he would
draw votes away from Gore.
</P>
<P>
   ``If the Democrats can't beat George Bush without my help, then
they are not even a party worthy of any recognition,'' he said,
adding that he sees little difference between the policies of the
parties. ``For 10 years now the Democrats have become very good at
electing very bad Republicans.''
</P>
<P>
   ``If they continue to do that,'' he said, ``they deserve to be
replaced.''
</P>
<P>
   Speaking to a cheering audience of high school and college
students attending a conference sponsored by Youth in Action, a
nonpartisan group based in Los Angeles, Nader said young people
should be ``turned onto'' politics to combat apathy and corporate
influence in the political system.
</P>
<P>
   Nader urged young people to help ``build a new progressive
politics'' to elect candidates ``who not only say what they mean
but mean what they say by getting corrupt money out of our
politics.''
</P>
<P>
   He said the current system ``has produced these political orgies
called Democratic and Republican conventions'' that manifests ``a
charade of presumed concern for everyday people.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS.)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Nader, best known as a consumer advocate who in the 1960s
tangled with General Motors over auto safety and later took on the
nursing home industry, ran a hapless campaign for president in
1996, registering less than 1 percent of the vote.
</P>
<P>
   But this time he says he is serious. The campaign has
organizations on 600 campuses and plans to add 400 more this fall.
He said the campaign has raised more than $1 million and that he
has visited all 50 states.
</P>
<P>
   ``There comes a point when you've got to do your part,'' he
said. ``The process keeps decaying. Our government keeps getting
hijacked by corporate money. We don't gave a real grass-root
government and political parties out fighting for the people.''

STRAINING FOR ELECTRICITY, CALIFORNIA MAY RESORT TO ROTATING
BLACKOUTS 
</HEADLINE>
  (ART ADV: Graphic is being sent to NYT graphic clients.

 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Four years after it led the nation into a sweeping deregulation
of the electric industry, California is at the brink of a breakdown
in its power supply.
</P>
<P>
   On Wednesday, as a heat wave caused electric demand to soar
across the West, the nation's most populous state nearly ran out of
power for the third straight day. To reduce the strain on
California's electric grid, regulators ordered utilities to curtail
supplies to big commercial users that have agreed to cut their
electric consumption in times of shortage.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the state was on the verge of imposing rolling blackouts
of homes and businesses. That step has been taken only eight times
around the country in the last 17 years, usually because of extreme
weather or power plant failures, says the North American Electric
Reliability Council, which supervises the Canadian and American
power grid.
</P>
<P>
   What disturbs California utility executives and regulators is
that this week's crisis has come even though none of the state's
power plants or transmission lines have failed and temperatures
around the state have been hot, but hardly extraordinary.
</P>
<P>
   In the last decade, demand for power surged along with the
California economy. But utilities, fearing they would be unable to
recover their costs as the state moved away from regulations that
guaranteed them profits, stopped building power plants, leaving the
state's power supply simply no longer able to keep up with peak
demand, they said.
</P>
<P>
   California's electric industry has reached the ``ragged edge''
of failure, said Robert Glynn Jr., the chairman and chief executive
officer of the PG&AMP;E Corp., whose Pacific Gas &AMP; Electric unit
delivers electricity to more than 13 million people in Northern
California. ``There's just barely enough supply to go around.''
</P>
<P>
   So far this summer, the California Independent System Operator,
a nonprofit state-chartered agency that manages the electric grid,
has scrounged up just enough power each day to meet demand. So the
lights have stayed on, except for a blackout in San Francisco in
June related more to local transmission problems than the statewide
shortage.
</P>
<P>
   But with supplies exceptionally tight, the wholesale price of
power has skyrocketed in the state. That has caused electric bills
in San Diego, where the retail price of power now fluctuates
directly with the wholesale market, to more than double, stirring
consumer anger and calls for the industry to be reregulated.
</P>
<P>
   The supply of electricity is also tight in New York and in New
England, which have faced spot shortages this year. Nationally,
power reserves have steadily decreased since 1992, with the
electric industry in the midst of a complex transition from
regulation to competition. But a surge in plant construction seems
likely to ensure that supplies and reserves will begin to increase
next year in most of the nation.
</P>
<P>
   ``The system is tight around the country, but there's been an
enormous supply response,'' said Jeffrey Skilling, president of
Enron, the Houston company that is the world's leading trader of
electricity and natural gas. ``In the next year or two, in most
parts of the country, there will be surplus capacity.''
</P>
<P>
   Not in California, where a combination of politics and geography
has left the situation especially acute.
</P>
<P>
   In the early 1990s, with deregulation looming and Southern
California stuck in a recession, utilities stopped building, or
even designing, new plants. No new plants have been built in the
state for more than a decade.
</P>
<P>
   California's economy has surged in the last five years, a boom
led by Internet and high-technology companies, which are voracious
power users. And growth is even more vigorous in the Pacific
Northwest, Arizona and Nevada, making it harder for California to
import the power on which it has relied.
</P>
<P>
   All that adds up to a squeeze that gets tighter every time an
e-commerce company in Palo Alto turns on its servers, or a new
office building opens in Orange County.
</P>
<P>
   The California Energy Commission, a state agency that licenses
new power plants and predicts the state's energy demand, says
California has a 10 percent reserve margin for this summer's
expected peak electric demand, assuming all its plants and
transmission lines are working perfectly.
</P>
<P>
   But plants and transmission lines often run at less than their
theoretical capacity. As a result, the state's reserve power margin
has already fallen below 5 percent a half-dozen times on hot days
this summer, forcing the Independent System Operator to begin
cutting power to some big commercial customers. On Tuesday, the
tightest day yet this summer, the reserve margin fell as low as 3
percent at 3:30 p.m.
</P>
<P>
   So far this summer, the state's reserve has remained above the
critical 1.5 percent margin that would trigger an even more
critical condition in which the Independent System Operator orders
utilities to begin rotating blackouts. How long the blackouts would
last would depend on how much demand needs to be curtailed, said
Ron Low, a spokesman for PG&AMP;E. But Low said the utility would try
to keep blackouts to less than two hours.

STANDARD CHARTERED BANK ANNOUNCES GLOBAL CUTBACKS 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Attn: Britain)   By ALAN COWELL   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   LONDON _ Standard Chartered PLC, a London-based bank with most
of its operations in Asia, announced a severe global cutback
Wednesday that would eliminate 5,000 positions, or about 20 percent
of the staff, to help lower costs.
</P>
<P>
   Such cuts, which tend to increase a company's stock price, have
been made by other big banks worldwide in recent years. But
Standard Chartered's cutback was coupled with an announcement that
its earnings in the first half of the year had been lower than
expected, and the bank's shares fell more than 10 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Standard Chartered said the cost-cutting, to include a
streamlining of its data-processing centers, would itself cost $715
million in severance and other expenses. It is projected to produce
savings around $105 million next year and $255 million annually
from 2003 onward.
</P>
<P>
   The bank said 6,000 jobs would be eliminated and 1,000 others
created. Of the special expenses, about $150 million will be used
to integrate Grindlays Bank, which Standard Chartered bought for
$1.3 billion in April as part of a planned Asian expansion. The
company said the purchase made it the leading international bank in
southern Asia.
</P>
<P>
   Though it does relatively little business in Britain, Standard
Chartered has operations in Hong Kong, Singapore, Malaysia, India
and other parts of Asia, where recovery from the financial crisis
of 1997-98 has benefited banks that do business there, like the
rival HSBC, by making it easier for individuals and companies to
repay loans.
</P>
<P>
   But, while HSBC reported a better-than-expected increase of 31
percent in its first-half profit this week, Standard Chartered's
profit increase seemed less robust, Investors compare the two banks
because of their similar emphasis on emerging markets _ shielding
them somewhat from the rough-and-tumble competition of retail
banking in Britain.
</P>
<P>
   Standard Chartered said the Asian recovery had allowed it to set
aside less money for potential bad debts _ equivalent to $246
million compared with $360 million in the period last year. This
saving increased first half-profit 25 percent above the level of a
year earlier, to the equivalent of $346 million. Analysts, though,
had forecast a 31 percent increase.
</P>
<P>
   Rana Talwar, the bank's chief executive, maintained that the job
cuts had been under consideration for 18 months and would affect
personnel throughout the bank's operations. The reductions matched
job cuts by banks in the United States, Britain and Germany,
reflecting competitive pressure that make traditional banking
operations less profitable.
</P>
<P>
   In the United States, the Bank of America has said that it will
reduce its work force by 9,000 to 10,000, and Dresdner Bank of
Germany is eliminating 5,000 jobs, or about 10 percent of its work
force. Barclays Bank recently stirred protests from British
customers and politicians with plans to close scores of small
branches.

 &HT;    FORD IMPROVING AFTER STROKE
 &HT;    By JIM GALLOWAY
 &HT;    c.2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHILADELPHIA _ Former President Gerald Ford was improving
Wednesday after being hospitalized for at least one stroke.
</P>
<P>
   Physicians at the hospital where he was treated were peppered at
a news conference with questions about his diagnosis.
</P>
<P>
   The 87-year-old Ford arrived at Hahnemann University Hospital
Wednesday morning under his own power, accompanied by his wife,
Betty, and U.S. Secret Service agents.
</P>
<P>
   ``President Ford is improving. He's much better than he was this
morning, when I evaluated him for a small brain-stem stroke,'' said
Dr. Robert Schwartzman, chief of neurology at the facility.
</P>
<P>
   Schwartzman and other doctors said it was ``possible'' that Ford
might have suffered at least one other stroke in the days before,
while attending the Republican National Convention.
</P>
<P>
   Ford was among three Republican presidents honored at the
convention on Tuesday, and the Ford family was included in the
opening prayer of Wednesday's session.
</P>
<P>
   Doctors at the hospital said Ford can talk easily, but that his
speech is still slightly slurred and he is still experiencing some
problems with balance.
</P>
<P>
   They predicted the former president will regain both in full,
saying no serious brain damage has occurred.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's saying he feels great, and wants to go home,'' said Dr.
Carol Thomas, director of the hospital's neurocare and stroke
program. Betty Ford, 82, has been staying in a room next to the
former president.
</P>
<P>
   ``She's traveling back and forth to his room,'' said Calvin
McDowell, a member of the president's advance staff. ``She's doing
excellent. She's the anchor that's very much in control of her
family. The Ford children, Michael, John, Steven, and Susan, were
keeping in touch by phone.
</P>
<P>
   Ford is expected to remain hospitalized for five to six days,
and has been put on anti-clotting medication.
</P>
<P>
   The diagnosis of stroke came on Ford's second visit to the
downtown hospital, which had been designated for treatment of VIPs
during the four-day convention.
</P>
<P>
   The former president and Michigan congressman first went to the
hospital after Tuesday evening's convention session and was
released within a half-hour with what doctors said at the time was
an acute sinus infection.
</P>
<P>
   While there, he complained to emergency room physicians of a
sharp pain in the right side of his face. ``All he was seeking was
pain relief for that night,'' said Dr. Wayne Satz, director of the
hospital's emergency room.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Stephen Klasko, the hospital's clinical dean, said Ford's
condition changed after he was treated and released, and that the
first diagnosis was appropriate based on the symptoms.
</P>
<P>
   Schwartzmann said that on Wednesday morning, when Ford returned
with his wife, Betty, she gave doctors more information about her
husband's symptoms in previous days.
</P>
<P>
   ``The family is very satisfied with his care,'' said Klasko.
</P>
<P>
   Ford aide McDowell said ``virtually everyone imaginable,''
including the White House, had called the hospital to inquire after
the former president, who brought the country from the brink of a
constitutional crisis following the resignation of President
Richard Nixon.
</P>
<P>
   McDowell said Texas Gov. George W. Bush, who accepts the
Republican nomination for president Thursday night, had asked to
visit, but all visitors were being turned away.
</P>
<P>
   Aides and a national television audience may have watched the
former president's symptoms unfold.
</P>
<P>
   During a C-SPAN interview Tuesday morning, Ford appeared
confused at times. He answered a question about racial diversity by
talking about Michigan's diverse economy, and a question about Iran
by talking about onions.
</P>
<P>
   Later, in a CNN interview, the former president appeared to slur
his speech as he rebuked President Clinton for entering the
campaign fray by attacking Bush.
</P>
<P>
   Lee Simmons, a special assistant to Ford at his home in Palm
Desert, Calif., told the Associated Press that he was concerned
after watching the former president on television.
</P>
<P>
   ``I could tell right away something was wrong. His speech was
not as sharp and clear and it normally is. I told my wife it looked
like he had a stroke or something,'' Simmons said.
</P>
<P>
   &Cx1f; The stroke occurred in the back of the brain, and affected the
area that controls balance and such activities as swallowing.
</P>
<P>
   Ford is officially listed in ``serious and improving'' condition
in the hospital's neural intensive care unit.
</P>
<P>
   Doctors said the former president suffered from no other health
ailments, other than a thickening of the arteries often associated
with aging.
</P>
<P>
   Schwartzmann said Ford took the news of his stroke in a ``very
calm, very collected'' manner.

 &HT;    HOLD - ADVANCE OBIT FOR GERALD R. FORD
 &HT;    NOT FOR PUBLICATION
 &HT;    Eds: This is an advance obit for Gerald Ford. Do not run unless
he dies.
 &HT;    By JEFF NESMITH
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Gerald R. Ford, an unelected president of the
United States who restored stability and honor to the White House
amid Watergate scandals, died (PUT DAY AND LOCATION HERE) at the
age of (PUT AGE HERE).
</P>
<P>
   Ford became America's 38th president during the depths of the
Watergate affair, taking office upon the resignation of President
Richard Nixon. He lost the presidency in a close election two years
later to Jimmy Carter, then the former governor of Georgia.
</P>
<P>
   Ford automatically became president at around 11:30 a.m. on Aug.
9, 1974, the moment Nixon's resignation letter reached Secretary of
State Henry Kissinger.
</P>
<P>
   Minutes later, Ford was sworn in by then-Chief Justice Warren E.
Burger and, in a televised speech from the White House East Room,
made the statement the country longed to hear and the one for which
he would always be remembered:
</P>
<P>
   ``My fellow Americans, our long national nightmare is over. Our
constitution works. Our great Republic is a government of laws and
not of men. Here the people rule . . .''
</P>
<P>
   And before a month was out, he took his most controversial
action as president, granting Nixon a ``full, free and absolute
pardon. . . .for all offenses against the United States which he. .
. .has committed or may have committed'' during his years as
president.
</P>
<P>
   The pardon, which Ford knew would stir deep anger among many
Americans and partisan criticism in Congress, was in many ways
typical of a quiet, dogged politician known for plowing ahead even
when he knew his actions would be unpopular.
</P>
<P>
   Years after leaving office, Ford, an avidly partisan Republican,
would declare that the president he admired most was an equally
partisan Democrat, Harry Truman. And the two would share a
reputation _ as men who navigated through public life on the basis
of directions from internal moral compasses, rather than according
to opinion polls or a perception of political climate.
</P>
<P>
   Born Leslie Lynch King Jr., son of Leslie and Dorothy Layer
Gardner King, on July 14, 1913, in Omaha, Neb., Ford grew up in
Michigan. His parents separated two weeks after his birth and his
mother took him to Grand Rapids to live with her parents.
</P>
<P>
   On Feb. 1, 1916, Dorothy King married Gerald R. Ford, a Grand
Rapids paint salesman, and they began calling her son, Gerald R.
Ford Jr., although his name was not legally changed until Dec. 3,
1935. He was 14 years old before he knew that Gerald R. Ford was
not his biological father.
</P>
<P>
   He attended the University of Michigan and was a star lineman on
the university's national championship football teams in 1932 and
1933. In 1934, he was named the team's most valuable player.
</P>
<P>
   In a column he wrote a year ago for The New York Times _ in
which he went against the mainstream of his party and spoke out for
affirmative action _ Ford recalled a game between his Michigan
Wolverines and the Georgia Tech Yellow Jackets in which the Atlanta
school ``reputedly'' wanted the Michigan team's only black player
dropped from the roster.
</P>
<P>
   Members of the Michigan team were adamant that their black
teammate take the field, Ford wrote, but in the end, he chose not
to play.
</P>
<P>
   ``His sacrifice led me to question how educational
administrators could capitulate to raw prejudice,'' Ford wrote.
</P>
<P>
   After receiving his B.A. degree in political science and
economics at Michigan, he turned down pro football offers from the
Detroit Lions and the Green Bay Packers to enter the Yale Law
School, serving as an assistant football and boxing coach.
</P>
<P>
   Two future U.S. senators, William Proxima of Wisconsin and
Robert Tat Jr. of Ohio, played on Yale football teams he helped
coach.
</P>
<P>
   After graduating from law school, Ford joined the Navy and
served during most of the major campaigns in the South Pacific.
</P>
<P>
   His biography on the Gerald Ford Library Web site notes that his
``closest call with death came not as a result of enemy fire,
however, but during a vicious typhoon in the Philippine Sea in
December 1944. He came within inches of being swept overboard.''
</P>
<P>
   Discharged as a lieutenant commander in 1946, Ford returned to
Grand Rapids. In 1948, he decided to challenge the incumbent
Republican for Congress and won by a large margin.
</P>
<P>
   The House of Representatives would be his political home for the
next 25 years. He served on the Public Works and Appropriations
committees and became House minority leader in 1965, unseating Rep.
Charles Hillock of Indiana.
</P>
<P>
   His reputation as a social conservative grew as he led
Republican opposition to many of the liberal programs of
then-President Lyndon B. Johnson between 1965 and 1969.
</P>
<P>
   Irked at Ford, Johnson was quoted as saying the House minority
leader had played in too many football games ``without his
helmet.''
</P>
<P>
   But Johnson also showed his regard for Ford by appointing him to
the Warren Commission, which investigated the assassination of the
late President John F. Kennedy. Ford became the last surviving
member of the commission, which was headed by then Chief Justice
Earl Warren.
</P>
<P>
   Ford supported Nixon in the 1968 and 1972 elections but never
realized his goal of becoming speaker of the House, where
Republicans failed to gain a majority during his service there.
</P>
<P>
   On Oct. 12, 1973, following the resignation of Vice President
Spiry Agene, who pleaded no contest to tax evasion charges, Nixon
announced that he would nominate Ford for vice president. It was
the first time the Constitution's 25th Amendment, providing for
filling an empty vice president's office, was invoked.
</P>
<P>
   Democrats were not unanimously supportive, with many calling
Ford a man of mediocre ability and limited vision, but he was
overwhelmingly confirmed by both the House and Senate.
</P>
<P>
   Proxima observed that although he thought the new vice president
had been wrong on almost every issue, ``he is a man that the
country may be looking for. He has the kind of wholesome sincerity,
the kind of loyal consistency that many voters may be looking for.
. . .''
</P>
<P>
   Only slightly over a year later, after succeeding Nixon, Ford
would nominate Nelson A. Rockefeller, one of America's richest men,
to succeed himself as vice president. For the first time in its
history, the country had both a president and a vice president
chosen under the 25th Amendment, rather than a national election.
</P>
<P>
   Ford survived two assassination attempts as president. Both
times, the assailants were women _ Lynette ``Squeaky'' Forme and
Sara Jane Moore.
</P>
<P>
   Arguably the most athletic president in history, he acquired the
image of a stumbling klutz, thanks in part to a new television
show, ``Saturday Night Live,'' on which comedian Chevy Chase poked
fun, week-after-week, at the president because of a pair of events
that might otherwise have faded from notice: Ford's stumbling on
the steps of Air Force One and an errant golf shot that hit a
spectator on the head.
</P>
<P>
   When the two met at an event, Chase observed, ``You're a very
funny president.''
</P>
<P>
   ``You're a very funny suburb,'' Ford snapped back, referring to
the Washington suburb, Chevy Chase, Md.
</P>
<P>
   But the klutz image and the Nixon pardon were part of heavy
political baggage Ford took into the 1976 election, and with Sen.
Robert Dole of Kansas as his running mate, he lost one of the
closest presidential races in U.S. history to Carter.
</P>
<P>
   In the opening line of his inaugural address, Carter recognized
Gerald Ford's legacy: ``For myself and for our nation, I want to
thank my predecessor for all he has done to heal our land.'' Seated
behind him, Ford wept quietly.
</P>
<P>
   After leaving office Gerald Ford continued to speak out on
public affairs, lecturing in over 170 colleges and writing numerous
opinion pieces for newspapers and magazines. His autobiography, ``A
Time to Heal,'' was published in 1979.
</P>
<P>
   The Gerald R. Ford Foundation sponsors a pair of national
journalism awards, one for stories reporting on the presidency and
the other for stories about national defense issues. Winners in
2000 were Carl Cannon of the National Journal for stories about the
presidency and Russell Carollo of the Dayton Daily News for writing
about defense issues.

JURY SAYS LAWYER SWINDLED MEXICAN FAMILY 60 YEARS AGO
</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
By JAMES PINKERTON 
c.2000 Houston Chronicle 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BROWNSVILLE, Texas _ A Wall Street lawyer swindled members of a
pioneer family out of oil and gas profits he made after buying a
coastal island from them more than six decades ago, a jury said
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   After four days of deliberations helped along with a calculator,
an all-Latino jury found that New York City lawyer Gilbert Kerlin
acted with malice when he conspired to deny members of the
Mexican-American Balli clan their share of more than $36 million in
mineral rights from Padre Island.
</P>
<P>
   ``I feel we have opened the door for a lot of Hispanic people in
South Texas,'' said Pearl Balli Mancillas of Brownsville, who has
pursued the claim in and out of court for 25 years. ``I feel really
good we were right all this time.''
</P>
<P>
   ``There is more than the money,'' said Rebecca Gomez Sexton, an
heir who represented herself. ``It's the preservation of the family
name, our heritage.''
</P>
<P>
   But a huge amount of money is potentially at stake in this case,
and in a number of others arising over old Spanish land grants in
South Texas.
</P>
<P>
   The Balli clan and other pioneer Mexican families who settled
South Texas have long claimed they were dispossessed of their land
_ either at gunpoint or by courthouse chicanery _ after waves of
Anglo settlers poured into the region following the war with
Mexico.
</P>
<P>
   The Ballis are seeking $11 million in oil royalties, past
interest and attorney's fees from Kerlin and his oil companies.
Kerlin, now 90 and retired, took the stand for eight days during
the six weeks of testimony and defended his dealings with members
of the Balli clan, some of whom were paid as little as $10 for
their land.
</P>
<P>
   The jury's 10-2 verdict awarded the Ballis almost $1.2 million
in compensatory damages and gave their legal team $1.5 million.
State District Judge Pat McDowell, a visiting judge from Dallas,
told the jury to return Monday when they are expected to take up
the issue of punitive damages.
</P>
<P>
   ``I knew it! I felt confident the whole time,'' said a joyous
Alma Santos, the owner of a suburban Houston beauty parlor whose
mother, 80-year-old Delores Balli, is one of the plaintiffs. ``This
is history, and we certainly put a chapter in the book.''
</P>
<P>
   The 278 plaintiffs in the historic case are descendants of an
18th century priest, Nicolas Balli, who was given the deserted
coastal island by King Carlos III of Spain in 1765.
</P>
<P>
   Still awaiting their day in court are another 200 members of the
Balli clan who intervened in the case and will have their claims to
the oil and gas wealth of Padre Island heard in a later phase of
the trial, the judge said.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is not an isolated case. It just didn't happen to the
Ballis. It happened to the Longorias, to the Hinojosas, the
Trevinos, it happened to a lot of people,'' said Pearl Balli
Mancillas.
</P>
<P>
   Also on McDowells's court docket is a pending land dispute in
Kenedy County, filed by 1,000 Balli heirs. Balli heirs say leases
filed in South Texas courts indicate that land, once part of the
King Ranch, was never sold by the family. Some of that branch of
the Balli family tree came to hear Wednesday's jury finding in a
show of support.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have more battles to come ahead,'' vowed Maria Isabel
Perales of Mission, a Balli heir and a plaintiff in the Kenedy
County dispute.
</P>
<P>
   In the case of the Padre Island property, it was 1938 when a
young Gilbert Kerlin was dispatched to Brownsville to buy the
narrow barrier island on instructions from his uncle, Frederick
Gilbert. But Kerlin ultimately wound up with the property, which
today is a major tourist draw dotted with hotels and condominiums.
</P>
<P>
   The land acquisition was the first case for Kerlin, a recent
graduate of Harvard Law School. He tracked down 60 members of the
Balli clan and paid to execute 12 deeds that conveyed the island to
the lawyer.
</P>
<P>
   Court records showed that 22 members of the family were each
paid $10 cash by Kerlin, who won't reveal what the others were
paid. The deeds gave the Ballis a share of future royalties on the
oil and gas beneath the island, but Kerlin never handed the money
over. &UR;
</P>
<P>
   &LR; During the trial, an oil expert hired by the Ballis testified
that Kerlin earned $36.6 million in royalties from the properties,
and the Balli share should have been $6.3 million, plus interest.
</P>
<P>
   Kerlin, retired from Shearman &AMP; Sterling, one of the nation's
oldest and most prestigious Wall Street firms, was not present for
the verdict. Citing a gag order, his attorneys would not say if he
planned an appeal.
</P>
<P>
   Anthony Knopp, an author and history professor at the University
of Texas-Brownsville, said he was ``a little surprised'' at the
verdict because many observers felt the evidence was weak.
</P>
<P>
   Also, there was a feeling the Balli cause was helped by a
sympathetic South Texas jury, he said. And while injustices
occurred, Knopp noted many Mexican-American families lost their
holdings in South Texas because they chose to sell or were unable
to pay property taxes.
</P>
<P>
   ``These other families are claiming they were somehow cheated
out of their land some 150 years ago,'' said Knopp, referring to
the period when Texas became a state. ``And certainly there were
cases where that happened, but there were a lot of other cases
where economic circumstances, cultural misunderstandings, led to
the gradual loss of land belonging to Tejanos.''
</P>

   The Balli case, filed in 1993, was first dismissed when
attorneys for the family failed to pursue it. Then it was revived
by Houston attorney Hector H. Cardenas Jr., who was part of the
four-lawyer team who tried a case which many predict will make
legal history.
</P>
<P>
   ``Clearly, a lot of eyes were watching this case,'' said Rob
Johnson, an Austin attorney on the Balli legal team.

FDA CRACKS DOWN ON RECYCLED MEDICAL DEVICES 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Attn: Minn.)   By KENNETH CHANG   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The Food and Drug Administration said Wednesday that it would
begin requiring that recycled medical devices originally intended
to be used only once meet the same regulatory standards that they
did when manufactured.
</P>
<P>
   The requirements apply both to companies that clean and
repackage the devices for subsequent uses and hospitals that do the
work themselves. The practice of reusing disposable devices,
including catheters, syringes and biopsy needles, has spread in
recent years as a cost-cutting move. It is impossible to say
exactly how widespread the practice is, but recycled devices are
believed to account for only a small portion of the medical device
market.
</P>
<P>
   The major third-party reprocessing companies welcomed the
regulations, saying they would dispel lingering doubt about the
safety of the recycled devices.
</P>
<P>
   ``We think it's a good thing,'' said Ronald Nordquist, president
of SterilMed Inc. of Minneapolis, a medical device reprocessor.
``It should force people that are substandard out of this
industry.''
</P>
<P>
   Device manufacturers have argued that the reuse of devices
designed to be disposable can pose a health risk to patients.
</P>
<P>
   The new guidelines do not go far enough, said Josephine
Torrente, president of the Association of Disposal Device
Manufacturers. ``The policy has some significant gaps in it,''
Torrente said.
</P>
<P>
   Device reprocessors say the manufacturers' concerns are related
more to competition and profits than to patient safety.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's an economic issue for them,'' said Pamela Furman,
executive director of the Association of Medical Device
Reprocessors. ``Their objective from the beginning has to make
reprocessing go away.''
</P>
<P>
   The reprocessors' association estimates that the annual sales of
their members now total $20 million, a small fraction of the
multibillion-dollar medical device market. Boston Scientific, one
of the major manufacturers of single-use devices, had sales of
nearly $3 billion in 1999.
</P>
<P>
   Hospitals have cleaned and reused disposable devices for about
20 years, said Larry Spears, an enforcement official with the FDA's
Center for Devices and Radiological Health. Companies specializing
in the cleaning and repackaging of single-use devices first
appeared about a decade ago.
</P>
<P>
   Stories of reused catheters that broke inside patients during
surgery led to hearings in Congress on the issue last year and a
review by the General Accounting Office.
</P>
<P>
   FDA officials said they started reviewing the issue last year,
because more complicated types of disposable devices were now being
reused. ``We questioned in our own minds whether those could be
effectively reprocessed,'' Spears said. ``We felt there was a need
to look more closely about this.''
</P>
<P>
   Under the new guidelines, reprocessors and hospitals that clean
and reuse devices must register with the FDA, and the agency, which
has been inspecting reprocessing companies, will also begin
inspecting the hospital reprocessing operations.
</P>
<P>
   If a device required an agency review before being introduced to
the market, the reprocessed device would have to undergo the same
review. Depending on the nature of the device, recyclers have six
to 18 months to submit safety data to the FDA.
</P>
<P>
   The manufacturers' association says a gap exists in the
guidelines because if a new device does not require FDA approval,
the recycled version also escapes review. A biopsy forceps, a
device used to collect a small tissue sample for cancer tests, is
exempt, but Torrente said studies had shown that forceps were
particularly difficult to clean.
</P>
<P>
   ``Despite that, they will be reused in patients without FDA
review,'' Torrente said. ``That's an enormous gap in patient
protection.''
</P>
<P>
   Torrente said a second concern was that the FDA had not yet
clarified what data it would require in its reviews. ``Patients
deserve to have this review standard made transparent,'' she said.
``We're asking for regulations that will ban all unsafe
reprocessing.''

PRESIDENT FORD APPARENTLY STRICKEN BY TWO STROKES &HT;    By ERIC ROSENBERG
 &HT;    c.2000 Hearst Newspapers
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHILADELPHIA _ Complaining of dizziness and slurred speech,
former President Gerald Ford was admitted to the Hahnemann
University Hospital here Wednesday after being stricken by two
small strokes.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Robert Schwartzman, the hospital's chief of neurology, said
he expected Ford, who had been attending the Republican National
Convention across town, to ``totally recover.''
</P>
<P>
   Ford, 87, checked in to the hospital Tuesday night. Physicians
initially diagnosed his condition as a sinus disorder and released
him with antibiotics to take over the next several days.
</P>
<P>
   But Ford, who became president when Richard Nixon was forced to
resign in 1974, returned under his own power, briefcase in hand,
Wednesday morning as his condition worsened. Doctors confirmed
after additional tests that he had suffered the strokes.
</P>
<P>
   By Wednesday afternoon, Schwartzman said, Ford still was dizzy
and had slurred speech and trouble swallowing. But the neurologist
added that ``President Ford is improving. He is much better.''
Ford, who will remain hospitalized for ``five days or so,''
probably suffered one stroke on Monday and another on Wednesday, he
said.
</P>
<P>
   Betty Ford, the former president's wife, was at his side and was
``very upset but fine,'' Schwartzman said at a news conference.
</P>
<P>
   Texas Gov. George W. Bush, who is set to be nominated for
president by convention delegates Thursday night, said in a
statement that ``America loves Gerald and Betty Ford for their
integrity, wisdom and compassion.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush also spoke to Mrs. Ford by phone as did President Clinton.
At a fund-raiser here, Republicans offered a moment of silence.
</P>
<P>
   Vice President Al Gore said in a statement that he joins with
all Americans ``in holding President Ford and his family in our
thoughts and prayers.''
</P>
<P>
   The doctors defended their initial decision to send Ford home,
saying that his symptoms were identical to those of an ear
infection. Releasing Ford ``was appropriate for the symptoms he had
last night,'' said the hospital's Dr. Stephen Klasko, another
neurologist.
</P>
<P>
   The type of stroke Ford suffered, likely a cerebral thrombosis,
is not usually fatal but can sometimes result in temporary or
permanent physical ailments such as numbness in the limbs and
speech impairment or, in more severe cases, reduced cognitive
skills.
</P>
<P>
   Strokes occur when sections of the brain are deprived of oxygen,
which is needed to sustain cellular life. There are two broad
categories of strokes _ those caused by blockages in arteries in
the brain, which account for roughly 84 percent of all strokes in
the United States, and those caused by ruptured blood vessels in
the brain, which account for 16 percent.
</P>
<P>
   The latter is more deadly, usually killing half of people who
are stricken, according to Dr. Abdul Nassief, who is on the faculty
at Washington University's stroke center in St. Louis. It was this
type of stroke that killed Sen. Paul Coverdell, R-Ga., last month.
</P>
<P>
   Ford, however, was apparently stricken by the less deadly
variety, which is often called a ``brain attack.'' Schwartzman said
it occurred near the base of his brain. Other experts said the
location offers the president a good prognosis because that region
does not govern a person's cognitive capabilities or the body's
most crucial organs.
</P>
<P>
   ``If a stroke happens at the base of the brain, a person has a
better outcome,'' said Nassief, adding that there is an 80 percent
chance of recovery in such cases. Still, a series of strokes to the
same region of the brain can lessen chances of a full recovery, he
said, leaving the victim with such physical ailments as numbness or
paralysis.
</P>
<P>
   Much like an arterial blockage near the heart that can lead to a
heart attack, this type of stroke occurs after arteries in the
brain have built up sediments that clog their passageways. When the
blood flow is reduced or restricted, the brain is then deprived of
oxygen, killing nerve cells. As the cells die, the part of the body
that they control also is affected.
</P>
<P>
   Schwartzman told reporters that said the former president has a
general hardening of the arteries that usually occurs with
advancing age.
</P>
<P>
   Ford, who is active in numerous health-related charities, last
year recorded a 30-second public service announcement for use on
Michigan television and radio to educate viewers and listeners
about the danger from strokes.
</P>
<P>
   According to the American Heart Association, strokes killed
159,791 people in 1997 and are the third largest cause of death in
the United States behind heart disease and cancer. Strokes are also
the leading cause of long-term disability in the United States.
</P>
<P>
   Some 600,000 people suffer a stroke each year. Women account for
61 percent of stroke fatalities. An estimated 4 million Americans
have survived stokes.

BOB WHO FROM WHERE? BATTLING OBSCURITY, UPHILL ALL THE WAY 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Attn: Pa., Nev., Fla., Neb., Mass., Ariz., Calif., Texas, Conn.,
Ky.)   By DAVID M. HALBFINGER   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHILADELPHIA _ Sen. Mitch McConnell, the chairman of the
Republican Senate campaign, was introducing the party's candidates
for open seats at a luncheon here Wednesday. He pointed to John
Ensign of Nevada, Bill McCollum of Florida and Don Stenberg of
Nebraska, then searched the room.
</P>
<P>
   ``Is anyone else here?'' he asked.
</P>
<P>
   ``Bob Franks!'' shouted the men from New Jersey, sitting near
their overlooked friend.
</P>
<P>
   Franks has had that kind of week.
</P>
<P>
   The Republican National Convention was supposed to be a chance
for Franks, a four-term congressman from northern New Jersey with a
low profile even in his home state, to grab some needed attention
for his underdog Senate campaign against Jon S. Corzine, the
Democratic multimillionaire who spent $35 million of his own money
in the primary alone.
</P>
<P>
   But on Monday, when Franks was to give his three-minute speech
from the convention floor, the daily schedule had him listed as
Gary Franks of Connecticut, who is not even a congressman anymore.
Franks humbly began his remarks _ a biting attack on Corzine, who
he said ``makes Ted Kennedy look like Barry Goldwater'' _ by
acknowledging his own obscurity: ``You don't know me, but you
probably have heard of my opponent.''
</P>
<P>
   Franks' turn at the podium might have received a fair amount of
attention in the New Jersey news media, always hungry for a local
angle. But about the time he was speaking, Sen. Robert Torricelli
was abandoning the Democratic race for New Jersey governor. So
Franks found himself quoted, if at all, in stories about other
people.
</P>
<P>
   At least his fund-raising efforts have not been fruitless.
Monday night, Franks was the guest of honor at a $1,000-a-person
party _ all that for hot dogs and an open bar _ aboard a Cape May,
N.J., ferry that had made a detour to Camden, N.J. The event raised
more than $100,000, Franks said.
</P>
<P>
   And Wednesday morning, Franks was introduced by former Sen. Bob
Dole at a mixer of big-ticket contributors organized by the
Republican Leadership Council, a group that helps finance moderate
candidates. ``We just picked up another 15 to 25 checks,'' Franks
said as he emerged from the hotel suite.
</P>
<P>
   More important, Franks and his finance director, Laura Slomka,
have been networking with party rainmakers in California,
Connecticut, Florida and elsewhere to hold fund-raisers for the
Franks campaign in the next several weeks. The first two, in Dallas
and Houston, will be given by Sen. Kay Bailey Hutchison of Texas,
he said.
</P>
<P>
   The next month or so will be critical for Franks, whose aides
say he must raise $8 million to $10 million to stand a chance
against Corzine. So at every opportunity, he is reminding listeners
of Corzine's liberal platform and even more liberal campaign
spending.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's the lens through which people outside of New Jersey are
looking at this race,'' he said. ``I can get up there and blah-blah
about the marriage penalty, or I can get their attention for 180
seconds and establish the stark contrast between Jon Corzine and
Bob Franks, the Republican they've never heard of.''

 &HT;    Debt-laden Carmike reels on industry woes
 &HT;    By Robert Luke
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA - Nervous investors Wednesday unloaded shares of
Columbus, Ga.,-based Carmike Cinemas, causing the stock to lose
more than half its value.
</P>
<P>
   The frenzied selling came a day after the company disclosed that
one of its lenders blocked it from paying $9 million in interest
due Tuesday on senior subordinated notes. The company, which
borrowed heavily to finance new theaters, said it will try to
renegotiate the terms of its loans and look for new sources of
financing.
</P>
<P>
   Carmike's shares fell to a 52-week low of $1.31 before finishing
at $1.50, down $1.75, or 53.8 percent. The shares had traded as
high as $33.06 two years ago. Nearly 1.5 million shares changed
hands, or about 27 times average daily volume.
</P>
<P>
   Carmike officials, who couldn't be reached for comment, sought
to reassure investors. In a filing Tuesday with the Securities and
Exchange Commission, the company said it should be able to generate
positive cash flow and meet its current debt obligations during the
next 12 to 24 months.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are not currently experiencing liquidity problems, and we
are hopeful that our bank lenders will work with us to establish
reasonable covenants that are more consistent with the economic
downturn in our industry and the company's expected financial
performance,'' Chief Financial Officer Martin Durant said in the
filing.
</P>
<P>
   To ensure the company will be able to pay its debts, Carmike
said it will eliminate new movie theater development, curtail
renovation and expansion of existing theaters and theater
acquisitions, increase management control over expenditures and
aggressively sell surplus assets.
</P>
<P>
   The company had planned to spend about $22 million this year to
build, expand and renovate theaters. Last year it spent about $170
million, opening 24 theaters with 313 screens, adding 39
auditoriums to existing theaters and retrofitting another 59
auditoriums.
</P>
<P>
   The reason for the level of last year's spending was stiffer
competition. The opening of new multiplexes by competitors _ with
digital surround sound and stadium seating _ threatened to draw
audiences away from Carmike's older facilities.
</P>
<P>
   To finance its projects, Carmike borrowed. Long-term debt
totaled $466.3 million as of Dec. 31.
</P>
<P>
   Box office strength helped to fuel the expansion, not only at
Carmike but other theater chains as well. But ticket sales lately
have come under pressure, putting many of the companies in a
financial bind.
</P>
<P>
   ``For example, during the last three weeks in June we saw a
sharp downturn in box office receipts as a result of unexpectedly
weak and disappointing film performance as compared to the prior
year,'' said Michael W. Patrick, Carmike's president and chief
executive, in the SEC filing.
</P>
<P>
   He added that while the company is ``continuing to actively
negotiate with the bank lenders, the company is considering all of
the options available to it.''
</P>
<P>
   One analyst identified Wachovia Corp. as the senior lender that
blocked the interest payment Carmike was about to make on its
notes.
</P>
<P>
   ``Wachovia is making a concerted effort to scrub their credit
reserves, asking, `What's at risk?''' PaineWebber analyst
Christopher Dixon told Bloomberg News.
</P>
<P>
   ``The industry has excess capacity, and the stocks have been in
a free fall,'' Dixon said. ``This isn't a surprise.''
</P>
<P>
   A spokesman at Wachovia, Vince Scanlon, declined to comment.
</P>
<P>
   Winston-Salem, N.C.-based Wachovia, which has significant
operations in Georgia, last month posted a 43 percent drop in
second-quarter profit. That's because it boosted its reserves
against bad loans by $200 million. The parent of Wachovia Bank said
slower economic growth was making it harder for some corporate
customers to keep up loan payments.
</P>
<P>
   Nonperforming assets as of June 30 were $298.7 million, up $52.6
million from the first quarter.
</P>
<P>
   Carmike Cinemas was organized in April 1982 after the leveraged
buyout of its predecessor, Martin Theatres, by Carmike's present
management.
</P>
<P>
   Carmike's officers and directors, including the Patrick family,
control the company through their ownership of Class B shares,
which aren't publicly traded. The Class A shares are listed on the
New York Stock Exchange.

COMMENTARY: THE GOP'S CONVENTIONAL WISDOM 
</HEADLINE>
   By WILLIAM SAFIRE    
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHILADELPHIA _ The purpose of a political convention used to be
to select a presidential candidate. That ended a generation ago,
but three other purposes remained:
</P>
<P>
   First was to have the party identify what it stood for, as state
leaders and national candidates hammered out internal compromises
on the anvil of the party platform.
</P>
<P>
   Next was to draw a sharp contrast with the policies and
priorities of the other party. The final purpose of a convention,
especially in modern times, has been to enable candidates to
introduce themselves to a national audience. In this vital showcase
of acceptance, the chosen leader is supposed to unify his party
and, with the nation paying attention, smite the political foe and
present his own vision.
</P>
<P>
   But this week we are enduring a non-political political
convention. No contesting views means no news; this leads to less
coverage and diminishing interest. What is politics without the
clash of ideas? What's the use of a great political showcase
without a partisan show?
</P>
<P>
   By vitiating the first two purposes of a convention _ no
internal dissent allowed, and then no external issues clearly drawn
with the opposition _ George W. Bush offers voters in a prosperous
time little compelling reason to switch control of the White House.
That, in turn, undercuts his ability to showcase both what's in his
heart and what's on his mind.
</P>
<P>
   Here is the tactical reason Bush operatives give for repressing
internal GOP dissent: If, for example, the anti-abortion plank had
been amended to make it palatable to most Republican voters,
pro-life absolutists in at least seven states would have triggered
a floor fight. That would have negatively dominated news of the
convention as well as alienated the ``base.'' (By such hardball did
Pat Robertson get his payoff and do the Democrats keep their
powerful gender-gap issue.)
</P>
<P>
   But what of the traditional role of the party out of the White
House in carrying the battle to the Ins?
</P>
<P>
   Again, the tactical, practical reasoning: Voters are turned off
by partisan bickering. Because impeachment was not popular, overt
criticism of any Clinton scandal, from lying under oath to illegal
Asian fund raising, is taboo. The only permitted reference is
oblique: Women speakers talk of ``restoring respect'' or promise
Bush will ``tell the truth,'' allowing alert viewers to impute
dishonor or untruthfulness to the White House incumbent,
whatsisname.
</P>
<P>
   This oratorical delicacy averts the dreaded
``mean-spiritedness,'' which pollsters say is death to a candidate.
And because Pat Buchanan's diatribe at the 1992 Republican
convention declaring cultural war helped elect Bill Clinton,
managers of this convention of consensus continue to overreact,
insisting on only sweetness and light, patriotic fervor and
passion-free compassion.
</P>
<P>
   That's why we saw Colin Powell limit himself to a single
sentence of party irregularity, and watched a wistful John McCain,
in an otherwise moving expression of loyalty to country and party,
ignore the campaign finance issue on which he so recently
campaigned. ``We need to get riled up a bit,'' he said, but did not
do.
</P>
<P>
   By suppressing internal dissent on the platform and about
primary reform, and by muting vigorous criticism of Democratic
policy, the GOP _ so far, at least _ has drained its 2000
convention of vitality.
</P>
<P>
   My right-wing brethren are loath to knock this. Because Clinton
stole conservatives' clothes on curbing welfare and stole swing
voters' hearts by harping on hope, many approve stealing the
Clinton approach to campaigning.
</P>
<P>
   But touchy-feely, above-the-battle mutual back-patting, so
universally advised by consultants, smacks of smugness, and calls
to mind the candidate atop the wedding cake.
</P>
<P>
   My ideological allies will say I'm a controversialist who needs
a public scrap to sell his wares. (How do they know what's in my
heart?)
</P>
<P>
   Not every expression of outrage at hypocrisy on high is ``the
politics of personal destruction.'' Not every wave of media boredom
is a ``vast conspiracy'' to deny coverage. Not every reminder of
demonstrable lying is ``beating a dead horse.'' Not all
spiritedness is mean-spiritedness.
</P>
<P>
   And if Bush's smiling-in-lockstep strategy backfires, the next
GOP convention may be much livelier.

COMMENTARY: A SLICK MIX 
</HEADLINE>
   By BOB HERBERT    
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHILADELPHIA _ It was disheartening to see Colin Powell up there
doing his bit to help mask the reality of the GOP, a party that
since the 1960s has been relentlessly hostile to the interests of
black Americans.
</P>
<P>
   This was on Monday night, when you couldn't tell whether you
were at the Republican National Convention or the Motown Review.
The number of blacks paraded before a national television audience
by this nearly all-white convention was incredible. The delegates
are about 90 percent white, mostly male and rigidly conservative.
So it was a breathtaking exercise in hypocrisy for them to haul so
many blacks before the cameras for the sole purpose of singing,
dancing, preaching and praising a party that has wanted no part of
them.
</P>
<P>
   Powell used some of his time to urge the party to become more
inclusive, and chastised it for opposing affirmative action. But he
nevertheless was the featured performer in the cynical lineup of
blacks and other minorities that was put together in a blatant
effort to cast the party as something it is not. If you looked at
the stage during this farce, and then turned and looked at the
audience, you saw two entirely different worlds.
</P>
<P>
   It's been like that all week _ ethnic overkill to mask the
party's lack of diversity. J.C. Watts, a black Republican
congressman from Oklahoma, was harmonizing one moment with the
Temptations, and singing the next with a gospel choir. Other
entertainment was provided by rhythm 'n' blues singers, dancing
black children and a fired-up preacher and his exultant
congregation.
</P>
<P>
   The makeover artists of the GOP put together a slick mix of
race, religion and culture and used it for all the wrong reasons.
It was exploitive and demeaning.
</P>
<P>
   The Republicans  &UR; still  &LR; aren't interested in blacks. They are
simply trying to present a friendlier, more moderate face to white,
middle-class swing voters who have been put off by the party's
excesses over the past several years.
</P>
<P>
   If the Republicans really wanted to embrace black voters (and
not just black children at photo ops) they would honestly address
such things as Dick Cheney's voting record; George W. Bush's
campaign appearance at Bob Jones University; George Herbert Walker
Bush's use of the disgraceful Willie Horton
(let's-scare-the-white-folks) campaign ads; Bush's cynical
selection of Clarence Thomas for the Supreme Court; and the GOP's
viciously anti-black Southern strategy, which has been a divisive
force in American politics for more than 30 years.
</P>
<P>
   If the Republicans were serious they would reassess the many
long years they spent attacking programs for children and the
elderly and the sick, and demonizing Democrats and liberals for
attempting to help minorities and the poor.
</P>
<P>
   But they're not serious. They are engaged in a four-day charade,
an exercise in duplicity that includes the shameless theft of the
slogan ``Leave no child behind,'' which was the registered
trademark of the Children's Defense Fund, a favorite GOP target.
</P>
<P>
   George W. Bush says he is a ``different'' kind of Republican.
But different from what? We need to know what it was about the
Republican Party of the last several decades that he thinks should
be changed.
</P>
<P>
   Does he think Republican policies need to change, or just that
Republican candidates should hug more black children?
</P>
<P>
   Republicans have long favored enormous tax cuts that served the
dual purpose of providing bonanzas for the wealthy and bleeding the
government of funds that could be used to help the less fortunate.
</P>
<P>
   Does Bush think that should change?
</P>
<P>
   Most of the Republicans I spoke with this week found it
difficult to think of anything substantive about their party that
should change.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. John Kasich, a conservative Ohio Republican who is chairman
of the House Budget Committee, was typical.
</P>
<P>
   ``We believe in less government,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   I asked what he thought Bush meant when he talked about a
``different'' kind of Republican.
</P>
<P>
   Kasich looked uncomfortable. ``I don't know,'' he said. ``I
don't know. You'd have to ask George Bush how he's different.''

NASDAQ STUMBLES UNDER HIGH-TECH WEIGHT 
</HEADLINE>
   By ROBERT D. HERSHEY Jr.   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ The Nasdaq stock market stumbled Wednesday as
skittish investors sought safety in blue chip stocks or headed for
the sidelines waiting for Friday's report on the job market in
July.
</P>
<P>
   Although the decline in the technology-heavy Nasdaq composite
index was modest, 27.06 points, or 0.7 percent, to 3,658.46,
analysts found little reason for optimism. They said that
high-technology shares, especially semiconductor companies, were
prone to summertime slumps and that stocks carrying high prices
relative to earnings seem most vulnerable to rising interest rates.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's still not a very high level of conviction that the
economy is slowing enough that the Federal Reserve can stop tapping
the brakes,'' said Hugh Johnson, chief investment officer at the
First Albany Corp. The Fed, which has pushed short-term rates up
six times in the last 13 months, is scheduled to meet next on Aug.
22. The government's tally of early-summer employment and other
economic reports will figure in the Fed's decision.
</P>
<P>
   The Dow Jones industrial average rose 80.58 points, or 0.8
percent, to 10,687.53. Hewlett-Packard jumped 4|, to 112{, and IBM
increased 4[, to 114 11/16. Exxon Mobil rose 1{, to 81 7/16; and
Home Depot rose 1[, to 53[.
</P>
<P>
   The Standard &AMP; Poor's 500-stock index gained 0.60 of a point, to
1,438.70.
</P>
<P>
   Stocks were buoyed by news that sales of new homes fell for a
third consecutive month to the lowest pace in 2{ years and by
comments from William Poole, the president of the St. Louis Federal
Reserve Bank, whose benign view of inflation risks implied that the
Fed might be able to forgo further rate increases.
</P>
<P>
   The Nasdaq's poor performance seemed to cast a pall over the
market in general. Dell Computer skidded 2, to 39 9/16, after being
downgraded by an analyst at U.S. Bancorp Piper Jaffray, who
questioned projected revenue growth. Cisco Systems, the biggest
drag on the S&AMP;P 500, fell 2\, to 60 15/16.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a tremendous amount of negative sentiment,'' said
Matthew W. Johnson, chief Nasdaq trader at Lehman Brothers. ``Some
people are taking money off the table,'' he added, while others are
switching into more defensive positions, such as provided by
established companies in oils, pharmaceuticals and utilities.
</P>
<P>
   While investors hope the Fed can rein in the strong economy to
avoid inflation, the risk is that profit growth will be lower.
</P>
<P>
   ``Wall Street's consensus forecast that S&AMP;P 500 operating
earnings will grow 12 percent to 15 percent annually is more than a
stretch,'' a Chase Securities report stated this week.
</P>
<P>
   Nonetheless, investors displayed a hearty appetite for new
issues, more than three dozen of which are slated to reach the
market this week. Floware Wireless, Genaissance Pharmaceuticals,
California Pizza Kitchen, Opnet Technologies and Entravision
Communications all climbed to handsome premiums in their first day
of trading.
</P>
<P>
   One of the day's biggest winners was the Sapient Corp., which
jumped 16 15/16, to 120 13/16, after announcing
better-than-expected earnings and a 2-for-1 stock split.
</P>
<P>
   A prominent casualty was Cigna, which dropped 4 11/16, to 96
9/16, after it said earnings growth was being hurt by problems in
disability insurance.

A SWEET UNION OF SOFT DRINK AND CONFECTION 
</HEADLINE>
   By CONSTANCE L. HAYS   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   In a critical report released last year, the Center for Science
in the Public Interest referred to soft drinks as ``liquid candy.''
Now there's a minitrend toward producing what might be called solid
soft drinks.
</P>
<P>
   A case in point is Snapple Beverages, a unit of the Triarc Cos.,
which is introducing a line of Snapple candy this fall. The concept
came from two entrepreneurs who thought that the unusual Snapple
flavors _ like peach tea, Mango Madness and pink lemonade _ might
translate well into candy.
</P>
<P>
   ``We thought the image of Snapple, which was fun and quirky and
innovative and different, lent itself to the industry,'' said Scott
Semel, who founded Cody Kramer Imports, based in Blauvelt, N.Y.,
with Reid Chase. ``Most candy licenses are event-driven or
character-driven, and not brand-driven. We solicited three or four
brands with our idea, and Snapple was our first choice because it
made the most sense.''
</P>
<P>
   Other companies are pursuing similar paths. Jelly Belly makes
three jelly bean flavors derived from soft drinks: Dr Pepper, A&AMP;W
root beer and A&AMP;W cream soda. All three brands are owned by Cadbury
Schweppes. ``It is a wave of the future,'' said Susan Fussell, a
spokeswoman for the National Confectioners Association. Other
examples include Hi-C fruit chews, made by Brach Confections, and
Sunkist fruit chews, which are produced by the Ben Myerson Candy
Co., she said.
</P>
<P>
   The soft-drink industry and the candy industry have both
experienced flat to little growth over the last several years, and
more manufacturers are trying to increase their sales in
convenience stores, so cross-marketing may have special appeal. On
the other hand, candy brands have been crossing over for some time
to other food categories; Snickers became an ice cream confection
several years ago, and other Mars brands turn up as ingredients in
McDonald's desserts and other ice cream concepts.
</P>
<P>
   Cody Kramer approached Triarc in June and fairly quickly
obtained a licensing agreement. The companies would not disclose
the terms, but, typically, brand owners receive a percentage of
sales from licensing their names.
</P>
<P>
   The candy has evolved into several forms. Snapplets are hard
candies packaged in Lifesavers-style rolls, as well as in bags.
Then there are Snapple Beans, which closely resemble jelly beans,
and Snapple Fruits, which are reminiscent of Gummi bears. A fourth
product, Snapple Whirls, is also similar to Gummi bears.
</P>
<P>
   The benefits are abundant, both for the licensee and the brand
owner, Semel said. ``It raises brand awareness in places where it
hasn't been,'' he said. ``You could be checking out of a grocery
store and see a Snapplet roll at the counter, and it will visually
enhance the brand in your mind. There's an intangible value to
that.''
</P>
<P>
   Then there's the object-permanence factor. ``You drink a drink
and it's gone in 30 seconds,'' Chase said. ``But a bag of candy is
going to stay with you. You'll have it in your house or on your
desk, and it's going to be in front of you for a long time.''
</P>
<P>
   Cody Kramer began as an importer of Lindt chocolate, pastilles
and other luxury products. Then the company ventured into
private-label candy manufacturing, producing tins of hard candy for
clients like Old Navy and Williams Sonoma. But those categories
represented the fringes of the candy business, and the founders
wanted to find a third area to develop.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's when the idea of licensing came into our heads,'' Semel
said. Other brands he wanted, but didn't get, include Ben &AMP; Jerry's
Homemade Inc., the Vermont ice cream company that was acquired by
Unilever PLC earlier this year for $326 million. Efforts to license
brands like Cherry Garcia and Chunky Monkey went nowhere, Semel
said.
</P>
<P>
   On the other hand, ``Snapple has been tremendous to work with,''
Chase said. ``They are constantly coming up with ideas for
promotions, how we can work with their beverage distribution. A
pizza parlor may have a Snapple machine, but there is not typically
candy in there.''
</P>
<P>
   He and Semel expect their company's sales to grow to $40 million
next year, up from $22 million this year, with about $12 million to
$15 million of next year's sales coming from Snapple candy.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a great idea,'' said Fussell, the spokeswoman for the
confectioners group. ``It combines two things that are already
popular, candy and beverages.''

segment, and many of the appraisers were worried that some kind of
expose is planned.

</P>
<P>
   ``Roadshow,'' PBS' most successful series ever, no longer has
thousands of people waiting in line because it uses Ticketmaster to
distribute a set number of free tickets about six weeks before it
comes to town. This, the insider writes, is ``just as well, since

<TEXT>
<P>
   PHILADELPHIA _ Big business and big money are working overtime
at the Republican convention _ in all the obvious places, and some
not so obvious.
</P>
<P>
   Big-time Washington lobbyists are behind the scenes doing the
nuts-and-bolts work that keeps the convention running smoothly, and
their clients happy.
</P>
<P>
   Take Red Cavaney, for example. His name _ it's Red on his
business cards _ does not appear on the official list of the senior
convention management team. But behind the scenes, he is the man
running the public convention show.
</P>
<P>
   As director of official proceedings for the 2000 Republican
National Convention, Cavaney is one of a cadre of powerful business
representatives who show up every four years to play important, but
very low-key, roles at the convention, said Republican National
Chairman Jim Nicholson.
</P>
<P>
   Cavaney is president and chief executive officer of the
Washington-based American Petroleum Institute, the oil industry's
trade association and lobbying arm.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's one of the people who put the program together, see that
the convention speakers are brought in and rehearsed and the sound
system is up and running,'' Nicholson said. He said he doesn't even
know how Cavaney got the job.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's just one of the volunteers,'' Nicholson said. ``Most of
them have been doing it for a long time. This is maybe his fifth
convention.''
</P>
<P>
   ``In fact, it's my eighth convention, but my fourth as director
of official proceedings,'' said Cavaney, who heads a team of 200
volunteers who work behind the curtains of the convention stage.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're the people who take the program concepts and we
implement everything, actually direct the show, what occurs on the
podium,'' Cavaney said.
</P>
<P>
   Gavel to gavel.
</P>
<P>
   ``We work with the participants and speakers, walk them through
what they will be doing, help develop their speeches, work with
teleprompters and speech coaches.''
</P>
<P>
   Cavaney's chores here reinforce his close contacts and access to
a lot of important Republican officeholders. And his convention
role is further evidence of the close linkage between the oil
industry and the Republican ticket.
</P>
<P>
   Texas Gov. George W. Bush was an oil company executive before he
entered politics. Dick Cheney, his choice for vice president, is
president of Halliburton, a huge international oil services
corporation.
</P>
<P>
   Cavaney's oil industry credentials are irrelevant, Nicholson
insists. ``He could be in the garment business and still be running
official proceedings. He's a guy who was brought up through the
system who was once a junior helper who eventually took over the
leadership.''
</P>
<P>
   Cavaney, 57, served on the White House staff under Presidents
Richard Nixon, Gerald Ford and Ronald Reagan. He took over the
American Petroleum Institute in 1997.
</P>
<P>
   Cavaney downplays the strategic usefulness of his position for
his lobbying activities.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was doing this even before I was a lobbyist,'' he said. ``I
do it because I just believe people should participate in the
public policy process, vote, and give their time and energy.''
</P>
<P>
   He admits, ``It's a wonderful opportunity to network and to see
old friends, but I'd not say it has any direct effect'' in future
lobbying activities. Cavaney and other veteran Washington lobbyists
he sees pitching in here already know most of the public officials
they are working with.
</P>
<P>
   But some critics say there is much more to it than that.
</P>
<P>
   ``They are cementing the relationships that are going to be
useful when everybody gets back to Washington,'' said Larry
Makinson, director of the Center for Responsive Politics, an expert
on the role of connections between money and politics.
</P>
<P>
   ``What we are seeing inside the convention is the public
campaign, the scripted campaign. What we are not seeing outside the
hall is the phantom campaign where the real action is taking place
connecting politicians with lobbyists and fund-raisers. That's not
open to the public.''
</P>
<P>
   Other big behind-the-scenes players are:
</P>
<P>
   _ Dean Griffin, the convention's chief technology adviser, is a
honcho at Andersen Consultants, which furnished $850,000 worth of
in-kind services to the GOP extravaganza.
</P>
<P>
   _ James Wray, a Washington lobbyist with a wide array of
corporate clients, is the key liaison man between the GOP
convention and the Bush campaign.
</P>
<P>
   _ Edward W. Gillespie, a big-bucks lobbyist who once worked for
and still acts as an adviser to House Majority Leader Dick Armey,
R-Texas, is in charge of orchestrating message and theme harmony
among the candidate and supporting speakers. It is his job to look
at the speeches and entertainment and be sure they convey what Gov.
Bush wants them to convey.
</P>
<P>
   _ Andrew Card Jr. is co-chairman of convention operations. A
former White House deputy chief of staff under President Bush, Card
is now General Motors Corp.'s top Washington lobbyist. Card's
convention backup is William Timmons, a premier Washington lobbyist
for blue-chip clients.

   PHILADELPHIA _ Few expect the Republican presidential ticket to
gain many more black votes as a result of the party's concerted
effort to complement Gov. George W. Bush's call for ``compassionate
conservatism'' with a deluge of dais diversity.
</P>
<P>
   But some political analysts believe the party may be hoping it
can at least take the edge off black animus toward them and, in the
process, excite fewer African-Americans to turn out to vote against
them.
</P>
<P>
   ``One thing Republicans can do with black voters without too
much destablizing their conservative support is help them to stay
at home,'' said political scientist Lorenzo Morris of Howard
University.
</P>
<P>
   ``By making Bush seem less threatening, Republicans may make it
harder to mobilize (black voters) and to demagogue as anti-black,
positions of the Republican Party,'' said Louis Bolce, a political
scientist at Baruch College in New York City.
</P>
<P>
   It is safe to say that the GOP message has not yet been
meaningfully received just across the Delaware River in Camden,
N.J., the oppressively poor, almost entirely black and brown city
where Bob Dole received 1,091 votes in 1996 (4 percent), and where
is it is unlikely that George W. Bush will do much better.
</P>
<P>
   ``If they come out to vote, they won't be Republicans,'' said
Gilbert Shepherd, a former school board member and seller of
reptile shoes. For Republicans here and across the nation, in that
``if'' may lie the best test of whether their call for inclusion
pays off in the black community.
</P>
<P>
   ``They know that they're not going to get any significant number
of black votes,'' said David Bositis, an expert on black politics
at the Joint Center for Political and Economic Studies in
Washington.
</P>
<P>
   Bositis and others suggest that the primary target of the
Republicans' new emphasis on inclusiveness are moderate whites, who
do not like to think of themselves as part of a party that they
think is racially exclusive or insensitive.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Republican Party wants to appear reasonable on race. In
the old days they were the anti-black party, or the party that
anti-black people rallied to,'' Bositis said.
</P>
<P>
   Bolce notes that the late Republican strategist Lee Atwater, who
was so successful at bringing white Southerners into the Republican
Party,had predicted in the 1980s that if Republicans could claim
even 20 percent of black votes, the South would be securely theirs.
</P>
<P>
   But this many years later, that 20 percent remains an elusive
goal.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's hard for them to get 10 percent,'' said Charles Bullock,
a political scientist at the University of Georgia. ``A better hope
for them is that black participation will be down a bit.
</P>
<P>
   The black vote has become even more crucial in recent years, as
turnout has risen, as the defection of white voters to the
Republican Party has gone about as far as it can go, and as the
country becomes, day by day, less overwhelmingly white.
</P>
<P>
   ``If (Republicans) stay the way they are right now, there will
be a solid Democratic majority in 10 years,'' Bositis said.
</P>
<P>
   Black voters were considered crucial to Democrats winning the
governorship in several Southern states in recent years, most
recently Mississippi, where Ronnie Musgrove last year won by a mere
8,000 votes. There are also significant numbers of black voters in
the swing states likely to be most hotly contested this fall.
</P>
<P>
   But Bositis does not believe even a kinder, gentler GOP can hope
to keep black voters from turning out for the Democrats this fall.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not going to affect turnout,'' said Bositis. He noted
that the Democratic Party has proven masterful at bringing black
voters out. A leading architect of those efforts has been Donna
Brazile, a black woman who is now Al Gore's campaign manager. In
key contests, each black voter is repeatedly contacted, including
programmed phone calls from the likes of President Clinton and the
Rev. Jesse Jackson.
</P>
<P>
   This October will also see the Million Family March in
Washington, which has set as a goal registering 1 million new
voters, and there is the possibility that the Rev. Louis Farrakhan,
the man behind the march, may express a candidate preference. This
too could have consequences. In the 1996 presidential election _ a
year after the original Million Man March _ black male turnout was
up 1.7 million, and Bositis thinks the two were related.
</P>
<P>
   In Camden, Zawdie Abdul-Malik, who heads the local Million
Family March organizing committee, has set his own goal.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're looking at about 5,000 (new registrants),'' said
Abdul-Malik, a local Democratic ward leader, who has been honored
by the state party for his prodigious work registering voters.
Right now, out of more than 35,000 registered voters in Camden,
only 891 are Republicans.
</P>
<P>
   Abdul-Malik, who serves on the school board and is considering
running for mayor, may be a Democratic activist, but he is
considering voting for Green Party candidate Ralph Nader this year.
Four years ago he wrote in Farrakhan for president.
</P>
<P>
   A black colleague on the school board, and fellow civic
activist, Rosemary Jackson was a Perot voter in 1992, and would
have considered Bush were it not for his enthusiasm for the death
penalty. ``Actually I like Bush,'' said Jackson. ``I think he is
different from the traditional Republican.''
</P>
<P>
   Jackson is unimpressed by Vice President Al Gore. ``Nah, no,''
she said. So, while she will vote in November, she may skip the
presidential contest.
</P>
<P>
   But in Charleston, S.C., the Rev. Joseph A. Darby, the pastor of
Morris Brown AME Church, does not expect too many in the black
community to stray from Gore or sit it out.
</P>
<P>
   Darby has been watching the convention from home, he said,
noting, sardonically, ``It's a real soul fest.''
</P>
<P>
   But Darby, who is an official with the South Carolina NAACP,
said some of the delegates to this convention (all white with the
exception of one black alternate) are the same folks he has been
fighting back home over the Confederate flag.
</P>
<P>
   (OPTIONAL TRIM FOLLOWS)
</P>
<P>
   When you get beyond the ``black floor show'' at the convention,
Darby said, there are very few blacks on the convention floor.
</P>
<P>
   This is true. According to the Joint Center's count, there are
85 black delegates at this convention, 4 percent of the total. And
yet, that is more than twice the black share of all Republican
votes in the last presidential election.
</P>
<P>
   ``Not a whole lot of brothers hanging,'' said Shannon Reeves, a
black delegate from Oakland, standing with his delegation on the
convention floor. ``I'm just out here trying to represent.''
</P>
<P>
   Reeves last heard George W. Bush speak in July at the NAACP
national convention in Baltimore. Showing up, he said, is half the
battle. The new ``open door'' at this convention will help. But it
will have to be sustained over the years and complemented by
performance. He does not expect it to yield much in the way of
tangible results when the votes are counted this November in
Oakland, where Democrats will win a commanding victory.
</P>
<P>
   But, he said, ``I want a big turnout anyway.''

LAWYER DEFRAUDED PRIEST'S HEIRS OF OIL ROYALTIES ,  JURY RULES 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Attn: Spain)   By   ROSS E. MILLOY   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ A Texas jury has found that a New York lawyer
defrauded several hundred relatives of a 19th century priest over
six decades ago and now owes them millions of dollars in oil
royalties and interest, according to a decision announced Wednesday
in Brownsville.
</P>
<P>
   Relatives of Padre Nicolas Balli and his nephew Juan Jose Balli
had sued the 90-year-old lawyer, Gilbert Kerlin, in 1994, charging
that Kerlin had promised to pay mineral royalties to their families
when he began acquiring title to their properties on Padre Island,
just east of Brownsville, in 1938.
</P>
<P>
   The island, rich in oil and natural gas, is named for Padre
Balli, who received title to the land from King Carlos III of
Spain. Padre Balli died in 1829, leaving most of the land to his
nephew.
</P>
<P>
   Kerlin had argued during the trial that Padre Balli's nephew had
sold the land, approximately 60,000 acres, in 1830 and that the
titles he acquired from the Balli family descendants were thus
invalid.
</P>
<P>
   But lawyers for the family produced evidence during the trial
that Kerlin and his lawyer, F.W. Seabury, had used the titles to
back up their claims of ownership when selling surface and mineral
rights to the land.
</P>
<P>
   In the decision announced Wednesday, the jury found that Kerlin
had conspired with Seabury, now deceased, to defraud the
unsophisticated Balli landowners by refusing to pay mineral
royalties as called for in the deeds of sale.
</P>
<P>
   The jury found that Kerlin and Seabury had acted with malice in
another transaction, involving 7,500 acres of surface rights to the
island, by claiming to represent the Balli heirs while gaining
possession of the land in a 1940s lawsuit but never informing them
of their ownership.
</P>
<P>
   ``Today, the Balli family honor is restored,'' said Hector
Cardenas, a Balli descendant and one of the lawyers representing
the family. ``This isn't the end of the process, but we're very
happy with the jury's decision.''
</P>
<P>
   Though the Balli ancestors have asked for $11 million in unpaid
mineral royalties, interest and lawyers' fees, plus an unnamed
amount in damages for fraud, the actual amount to be paid has yet
to be determined, said lawyers involved in the case.
</P>
<P>
   ``The jury has given us nearly everything we asked for, but
there are some differences in the way they want to calculate the
royalties,'' said Robert Johnson, one of the plaintiffs' lawyers.
``We haven't calculated what the various awards made today by the
jury amount to yet, but it's safe to say that the families will
receive several million dollars at least.''
</P>
<P>
   Over $1.5 million in legal fees were also awarded to the
plaintiffs' lawyers, said Johnson.
</P>
<P>
   Another lawyer involved said the family's legal team estimates
that unpaid royalties and interest alone will exceed $10 million.
</P>
<P>
   The jury will begin deliberations about punitive damages on
Monday, said Johnson.
</P>
<P>
   Contacted Wednesday in New York, Kerlin, citing an order by the
presiding judge in the case not to talk about the lawsuit, would
say only, ``We've still got a long way to go yet.''

COLIN POWELL'S SECOND CHALLENGE

<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ ``Some in our party miss no opportunity to roundly
and loudly condemn affirmative action that helped a few thousand
black kids get an education,'' Colin Powell told the Republican
convention this week, ``but you hardly hear a whimper when it's
affirmative action for lobbyists who load our federal tax code with
preferences for special interests.''
</P>
<P>
   His defense of affirmative action got all the attention, but his
challenge was twofold because he was also criticizing politicians'
giveaways to corporations, which, in turn, contribute to those
politicians' campaigns. Though this challenge could have been
leveled at both Democrats and Republicans, let's start with the
GOP.
</P>
<P>
   Dick Cheney, the party's vice presidential nominee, complained
about the oppressive, wasteful, inefficient role of big government
throughout his political career. But while he has been the chief
executive of Halliburton, a Dallas oil services company, few
businessmen have benefited more from federal government help.
</P>
<P>
   In the five years that Cheney has run Halliburton, the company
and its subsidiaries have received $2.3 billion in federal
contracts, up from $1.2 billion during the five years preceding his
tenure. Halliburton also received $1.5 billion in guaranteed or
direct loans from the Export-Import Bank and the Overseas Private
Investment Corp. In the five years before Cheney joined the
company, it received only $100 million from these government
institutions.
</P>
<P>
   How did Halliburton double its federal contracts and increase,
by a factor of 15, the amount of direct or government-guaranteed
loans? The company may attribute its success to other factors, but
is it a coincidence that in the past five years, Halliburton gave
$1.2 million to the two political parties and individual members of
Congress? According to the Center for Responsive Politics, the
company also increased its Washington lobbying: its costs
mushroomed from $280,000 in 1996 to $600,000 last year. As
Halliburton's fortunes have risen, so, too, have Cheney's, who
after five years at the helm is worth about $50 million.
</P>
<P>
   Like Cheney, Gov. George W. Bush talks of the importance of
self-reliance and getting government out of the way of private
initiative _ unless, of course, there is a little ``affirmative
action'' for your company.
</P>
<P>
   His success in business was also famously tied to government
largess. Bush made $14.9 million from the sale of the Texas Rangers
baseball team, a 25-fold return on his investment of $606,302. The
team's phenomenal rise in value was directly tied to a new stadium
financed by more than $200 million in public subsidies and tax
incentives. Taxpayers didn't get a return from the Rangers' surging
new revenues. The profits went almost exclusively to the team's
owners.
</P>
<P>
   The Republicans hold no monopoly on hypocrisy. Despite the move
of his campaign operation from Washington to Nashville, Vice
President Al Gore is still close to the lobbyists on K Street. His
closest confidants and campaign advisers are lobbyists for all
kinds of corporate interests. His $30 million in 1999
contributions, a Democratic record for fund-raising in a year
before a presidential election, didn't come from backyard
barbecues.
</P>
<P>
   Gore says that as president he would reform the campaign finance
system. Yet he has clung steadfastly to legalistic evasions about
the nature of both the notorious White House coffees, which
collected $26.4 million for the Democratic Party from 1,544 people
who sought face time with the president and vice president, and the
Buddhist monastery event, which he has said was nothing more than
``community outreach.'' Such sustained sophistry is tiresome and
does not speak well for an administration that claims to want to
clean up the system.
</P>
<P>
   So while I hope that both the Democrats and Republicans take the
second half of Colin Powell's message seriously, I won't hold my
breath. Certain kinds of ``affirmative action'' are not going
change much anytime soon.

CANADIAN PRESS BARON CONTEMPLATES HIS FORTUNE 
</HEADLINE>
   By JAMES BROOKE   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   MONTREAL _ So what is Conrad Black going to do with his bags of
money now that he has sold most of the crown jewels of Canada's
newspapers in one fell swoop?
</P>
<P>
   ``Do you remember that cartoon character, Scrooge McDuck?''
Black said, answering a question with a question. ``Do you remember
how he used to get into his little bulldozer every morning and plow
back and forth over his gold coins? Well, maybe I will just sit and
look at it for a while.''
</P>
<P>
   Looking back to 1969, when he bought a tiny English-language
paper in Quebec, Black, now 55, said, ``I started in this business
30 years ago with an investment of $500.''
</P>
<P>
   Returning to the present, he said of the deal announced this
week: ``It was time in the history of my country, and time in my
own history, to make things shipshape, to get rid of the debt, to
get a bit of a cash box to work from, to enjoy life a little
more.''
</P>
<P>
   Few pundits in newspapers today predicted an easy-chair life for
Black, a Napoleon buff who has run his newspaper empire from a
chair once owned by his military hero. As Black trims his sails in
North America _ a sale of his community papers in the Chicago area
is believed to be imminent _ Canadians say they believe that he
will turn his energies to Europe.
</P>
<P>
   A holder of dual British and Canadian citizenship and owner of
the Daily Telegraph of London, Black could seek new European
investments for the company that on Monday bought most of his
Canadian newspapers, the CanWest Global Communications Corp., now
Canada's largest media company.
</P>
<P>
   Commenting extensively about the deal for the first time since
it was announced, Black said in a telephone interview Tuesday night
that the sale to CanWest would leave his company, Hollinger Inc.,
on a solid financial footing. ``We will go from $1.7 billion in
debt to zero plus $500 million in cash, perhaps a bit better than
that,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Noting that Hollinger stock had bounced back from depressed
levels in recent months, he said he was selling his newspapers
``fairly close to the top of the economic cycle.''
</P>
<P>
   Black also justified his heavy selloff here, saying he was
``overexposed in Canada.'' In a separate interview with the
National Post, his Toronto-based newspaper, Black added, ``The
reputation of Canada is not particularly great among American
investors.''
</P>
<P>
   Although Americans have poured billions into the Toronto Stock
Exchange this year, helping it to rise faster than the New York
exchanges, Black said his pool of buyers was artificially limited
by Canadian laws that discourage foreigners from buying Canadian
newspapers. Noting that Canada is essentially off limits to
American newspaper chains, he complained, ``With these ridiculous
foreign-ownership rules in Canada, you can't get much equity.''
</P>
<P>
   Israel Asper, the chairman of CanWest, has predicted that the
editorial line of his newspapers will be ``balanced,'' a word
rarely found in the lexicon of Black, a crusty, conservative press
baron who has been described by detractors as a thesaurus that
walks like a man.
</P>
<P>
   In response, Black snorted at newspaper characterizations of
Asper as a ``social democrat,'' saying that he and his new business
partner see eye to eye on economic issues and recalling that he
first met Asper 25 years ago when he was writing a personal tax
column for the Winnipeg Free Press. Questioned further, he
acknowledged having had ``a bit of wrestling match with Izzy'' over
the National Post, which in less than two years has established an
intellectual beachhead for conservative, free-market changes in
Canada.
</P>
<P>
   After the wrestling was over, ownership of the National Post was
split 50-50 between the two business groups. Black, who is to be
chairman of the newspaper for five years, says it sells 330,000
copies daily.
</P>
<P>
   ``Under our arrangement, he has no ability to change it,'' Black
said of Asper and the editorial line of the Post, which has become
a cheerleader for the Canadian Alliance, the nation's new
tax-cutting party. Asked if the editorial line would change, he
stressed, ``Zero, nothing, not one millimeter.''
</P>
<P>
   But leaders of Canada's ruling Liberal Party, a frequent target
of criticism from the editorial pages of Black's newspapers, were
elated at news of the purchase by Asper, a longtime centrist
Liberal.
</P>
<P>
   Calling the sale ``the best news they had had in a long time,''
Lawrence Martin, a Southam News political analyst, wrote from
Ottawa of the Liberals: ``Even a measured neutrality will be viewed
by the prime minister as a major plus over the treatment he felt he
was receiving before the newspaper sale.''
</P>
<P>
   The government of Prime Minister Jean Chretien has not given the
slightest hint that it will move to block the sale.
</P>
<P>
   Toronto is home to one of the toughest newspaper wars in the
English-speaking world, a three-way battle among the National Post,
the Globe and Mail and the Toronto Star. On Tuesday, the Globe and
Mail printed on the top of its front page a large, full-color
cartoon of Asper grinning and preparing to dine on a prostrate
Black, who was depicted stuffed and spiced, with a sprig of parsley
in each ear. The headlines read: ``Asper: Mogul and a half'' and
``Black: Only half a mogul.''

<P>
   Despite its gloating, the Globe and Mail now stands alone,
virtually the only major English-language Canadian newspaper that
does not have ties to CanWest, which has a Canadian network of
television stations broadcasting coast to coast.
</P>
<P>
   After a day of reflection, the Globe and Mail came out Wednesday
with an editorial salted with crocodile tears and headlined:
``Black to fade.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Since Canada does not have so many larger-than-life characters
that it can afford to lose any of them cheerfully, the notion of a
vanishing Conrad Black is rather affecting,'' the editorial said.
In a service to readers, it warned that some Canadians ``will
experience the disorientation that follows the abrupt end of a
toothache.''

U.S. FACES WORST YEAR FOR WILDFIRES SINCE MID - '80S 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Attn: Ariz., Calif., Idaho, Mont., Nev., Texas, Utah, Wis., Mich.,
Minn. and Wyo.)   By MICHAEL JANOFSKY    
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service

<P>
   DENVER _ Prolonged hot and dry weather this summer, especially
in the West, has made this the worst year since the mid-1980s for
wildfires around the country. With no major meteorological changes
in sight, many more fires are expected before temperatures cool in
the fall.
</P>
<P>
   The National Interagency Fire Center in Boise, Idaho, has
recorded 61,400 fires this year that have burned nearly 3.6 million
acres, the vast majority in Western states. The fires include 17
new wildfires reported overnight, bringing to 47 the number of
large wildfires that are burning on 707,223 acres in Arizona,
California, Idaho, Montana, Nevada, Texas, Utah and Wyoming.
</P>
<P>
   ``This year has been much worse than average,'' said Dennis
Pendleton, the center's director, judging the severity by the
number of acres burned. ``With the number of acreage burned, the
number of fires and the drought, it's the worst we've had in 15
years and it could become one of the worst years we've ever had.''
</P>
<P>
   Complicating matters for firefighters is a wildfire season made
unusually long by the unchanging weather patterns. The season
typically ends in June in many Southern states and in July through
the Southwest, when heavy rains materialize. But persistently dry
weather has left many forest regions brittle and easily set ablaze
by a lightning strike or a discarded cigarette, which is how many
are started.
</P>
<P>
   In its daily assessment of conditions around the country, the
fire center said Wednesday that 11 states in the West were
reporting ``very high to extreme fire danger indices,'' with hot
and dry weather expected to continue.
</P>
<P>
   The cumulative effect of an ever-growing number of fires has
placed such a high demand on firefighting personnel and equipment
this summer that two military battalions of 500 each have been
called to assist, a normal procedure when wildfires have
overwhelmed local and state resources and firefighters have tired.
</P>
<P>
   An Army battalion from Fort Hood, Texas., arrived in Boise on
Tuesday to begin field training Thursday for action later this
week, fighting the Burgdorf Junction fires in central Idaho. A
Marine battalion from Camp Pendleton in Southern California is
scheduled to arrive for training on Saturday for deployment to the
Clear Creek fires in northern Idaho.
</P>
<P>
   ``The demand has been unusually high,'' Pendleton said of the
need for added firefighters and equipment. ``The same people have
been chasing a good deal of the fires around the country since
early April. Just in California, we've problems since January.''
</P>
<P>
   The fire center measures the severity of wildfires in a variety
of ways _ by the number of fires, by the number of acres burned and
by how many military battalions have been summoned to help.
</P>
<P>
   Over the last 50 years, 1981 was the worst for the number of
fires, with 249,370; 1950 was the worst for number of acres burned,
with 17.5 million; and wildfires in 1988 demanded the largest
number of battalions, 8.
</P>
<P>
   Many times, wildfires cause deaths, and by that measure this
year has been relatively safe. Only one death has been attributed
to firefighting efforts, that of a smoke-jumper from Alaska whose
parachute failed to open while he was training.
</P>
<P>
   Records kept by the fire center indicate that the worst years
for deaths were 1871, when wildfires in Wisconsin and Michigan
caused the deaths of 1,500 people, and 1894, when wildfires in
Minnesota killed 418.
</P>
<P>
   Fewer deaths have been recorded in recent years, largely because
of the ability to warn people far in advance of spreading fires so
they can evacuate the area and because of improved firefighting
equipment.
</P>
<P>
   Another measure is the cost of fire suppression, although it is
difficult to put a final price on overall damage caused by
wildfires in a given year because the accounting would take into
consideration costs to the federal government, as well as state and
local agencies and individuals through property damage.
</P>
<P>
   Among the five federal land agencies over the six years through
1999, the largest costs, by far, have been borne by the Forest
Service, $2.1 billion, according to figures compiled by the fire
center. The overall federal cost for the six years was $2.9
billion.
</P>
<P>
   While the fires that burned in Los Alamos, N.M., several months
ago received widespread national attention for the danger they
posed to the national laboratories, other fires have caused equally
troublesome problems for local residents.
</P>
<P>
   Among those now burning, fires south of Hamilton, Mont., have
closed a state highway and forced evacuations in four towns.
Abandoned mineshafts around fires burning north of Helena, Mont.,
are hampering firefighting efforts there. Wildfires east of Phoenix
are threatening summer homes, recreation areas and endangered
species habitats. Residents of several Utah towns southwest of
Provo have been warned that spreading fires might come their way.
</P>
<P>
   Among the most challenging wildfires still burning out of
control are those spreading across 5,100 acres of Cleveland
National Forest, northeast of San Diego, where officials with the
Forest Service say the rugged and inaccessible terrain, combined
with limited resources, could leave the fire burning another week
or more.
</P>
<P>
   Even with seven helicopters assisting 1,000 firefighters, the
wildfires Wednesday were only 15 percent contained.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're about a month early, how dry it is,'' said Elliott
Graham, a Forest Service spokesman at the site. ``This one is
different; a lot of it is in a wilderness area.''

 &HT;    Brewer saddens tech community
 &HT;    By Frances Katz
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Charles Brewer, who resigned Wednesday as chairman of
EarthLink Inc., has been distancing himself from the company since
the merger of MindSpring and EarthLink in February.
</P>
<P>
   In a news release issued late Wednesday, Brewer said he left the
company to pusue other interests. Brewer was chairman and CEO of
MindSpring Enterprises, the Atlanta-based Internet service provider
he started in his basement in 1994. When MindSpring merged with
EarthLink Networks to become EarthLink Inc. on Feb. 4, Brewer took
a step back from day to day operations and became chairman of the
new company.
</P>
<P>
   Brewer has sold his holdings in EarthLink, including 2.9 million
shares the company bought from him as part of it's stock repurchase
plan.
</P>
<P>
   The company will continue to be Atlanta-based said EarthLink CEO
Garry Betty. A Georgia native and Georgia Tech grad who has
maintained a home in the Atlanta suburb of Sandy Springs for more
than a decade, Betty said his commitment to the city was as strong
as Brewer's. ``My roots in this town go way back. My passion and
commitment to Atlanta is no less, and EarthLink will continue to
play a big role in the Atlanta tech community.''
</P>
<P>
   EarthLink founder Sky Dayton, who left the company to found the
business to business incubator eCompanies, will step back in as the
new chairman of the board. No other positions are affected by
Brewer's resignation.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sky's passion has always been for the Internet and the
Internet experience,'' said EarthLink president Michael McQuary who
held the same title at MindSpring and is a close friend of
Brewer's. ``Charles was more interested in how the company was run.
Charles would work at a cheese factory if it was run right. ``
</P>
<P>
   Employees, interviewed Wednesday night said that Brewer would be
missed.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you meet him, he has an air about him. He seems so
energetic. You meet him and you think I want to know this guy,''
said Ty Welch, who has worked for the Internet provider for five
years and now is in charge of training call center workers on the
East Coast.
</P>
<P>
   Welch said even the lowest level workers feel drawn to Brewer.
However, he said the merger hadn't changed the company's direction,
and he didn't expect Brewer's departure to change it either.
</P>
<P>
   Lindsey Milton, who has worked for EarthLink for six months,
said ``I am mostly just surprised. We all have a personal
attachment to him.''
</P>
<P>
   John Waln, customer service representative there, said: ``It's
sad, the company is built on his core values and beliefs. However I
don't think that will change.''
</P>
<P>
   Analysts who follow the company and have known Brewer for years
said Brewer had gradually faded into the background after the
EarthLink merger.
</P>
<P>
   As the public face of MindSpring in its heyday of aggressive
growth and soaring stock prices, Brewer was a familiar presence,
not only in Atlanta, but to faithful viewers of financial news
channels.
</P>
<P>
   In Atlanta, Brewer became a legend for starting a litte Internet
company in his basement and watching it grow one of the top ISPs in
the country. All the while, he adhered to his ``core values and
beliefs'' that guided the compaupermarkets,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   When Brewer finally made the decision to merge with EarthLink
last year, many MindSpring subscribers and shareholders feared
that, without Brewer's sense of purpose, the company would lose the
quirky appeal and commitment to customers that was its hallmark.
</P>
<P>
   Shortly before the merger, Brewer said he understood that in
order to grow, MindSpring would have to give up a little bit of its
style.
</P>
<P>
   ``If there was one thing missing from our (corporate)
personality, I would say it was competitiveness,'' he said in an
interview last January. ``I always wished we were more competitive.
EarthLink has a more aggressive edge. Some blending of that could
turn out a hybrid that is better than what we each had
individually.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Since the merger he stuck around to make sure these things
were going to keep going,'' said analyst Miles Russ of
Atlanta-based Robinson Humphrey. ``He just went on the board of
Humana (a health insurance company based in his hometown of
Louisville, Ky.) and he probably has some other things cooking. He
hasn't been very visible to the investment community since the
merger.''
</P>
<P>
   Russ said he only knew Dayton by reputation, but ``knowing what
a good job he did with EarthLink, I think it's a good sign for the
markets. He's run one of the top ISPs in the U.S.''
</P>
<P>
   Jeff Sadler, an analyst at FAC Equity in Boston, said he wasn't
surprised by Brewer's departure. ``He's made his money, and he has
no desire to run the company at this stage. The timing of this is
pretty typical. ``
</P>
<P>
   Sadler also thinks Dayton's appointment to chairman was a good
move for EarthLink. ``It seemed that Sky had pretty much washed his
hands of EarthLink to run eCompanies. Maybe (EarthLink) realized
that with the stock at the price where it's at, something needs to
be done. Sky has had a very creative hand in the past and he may
have some ideas about the future. The company needs some strategic
direction, and it's quite possible Sky has some good ideas. I think
he will be a welcome addition.''
</P>
<P>
   Betty said that even though Dayton was working his ``day job''
at eCompanies he has been a very active member of the EarthLink
board. ``We are happy to have Sky step in and resume his role as
chairman,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Dayton left the company after the EarthLink merger to start
eCompanies in Santa Monica. Dayton who founded EarthLink in
California 1995 _ the same time Brewer was launching MindSpring in
Atlanta _ is credited with many innovations in the Internet access
arena that most users take for granted today.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were the first ISP to offer a software package to allow
people to connect right to the Internet in the summer of 1995,''
Betty said. Dayton also had the idea to create EarthLink software
that defaulted to an EarthLink homepage.
</P>
<P>
   `` From a personal standpoint, I'm sad to see Charles leave,''
said Frank Gristina, also of Robinson Humphrey. ``He built such a
great legacy, but the legacy certainly continues, with someone as
experienced as Sky Dayton at the helm.''
</P>
<P>
   ``He'll challenge us to do better and drive us nuts,'' McQuary
said. ``Just the way Charles used to drive us nuts. ``

CONVENTIONS' TV AUDIENCES SHRINK, BUT IS REDUCED COVERAGE THE
REASON? 
</HEADLINE>
   By BILL CARTER   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   In 1984, ABC shocked news purists by inserting a rerun of a
canceled series, ``Hart to Hart,'' in the middle of one night's
convention coverage. The same year an ABC News executive, Jeff
Gralnick, labeled the conventions ``dying dinosaurs.''
</P>
<P>
   In 1992, CBS skipped one night entirely to cover baseball's
All-Star game. In 1996, Ted Koppel of ABC yanked his ``Nightline''
crew from the Republican convention one night early, declaring
there was too little news.
</P>
<P>
   For two decades, the amount of convention coverage has been a
testy issue. This year, the debate has only intensified as the
broadcast networks have further cut back on the hours devoted to
the convention, saying that viewers are uninterested. Over the
first two nights of this year's Republican convention, the ratings
seem to back them up. But whether the falloff in audience is a
result of viewers losing interest or the broadcast networks simply
offering them less to be interested in is a matter of some debate.
</P>
<P>
   The chairmen of both parties confronted network executives at a
panel discussion in Philadelphia Sunday accusing them of shirking
their civic duty by drastically curtailing the number of hours of
live coverage. The chairmen argued that by deemphasizing coverage,
the networks were sending the message that the conventions are not
newsworthy.
</P>
<P>
   Network executives dismissed that charge. ``I reject that
chicken and egg theory,'' said Andrew Heyward, the president of CBS
News. ``I do not think people are less interested because we're
covering less, but because they find the conventions less
compelling.''
</P>
<P>
   For Tom Brokaw, the NBC anchor, who has covered every national
political convention since 1968, the blame lies squarely with the
decisions made by the parties to eliminate all semblance of
suspense or debate.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are covering them differently because there's no `there'
there,'' he said. ``The parties have drained all the drama out of
the proceedings.''
</P>
<P>
   With network coverage reduced at the same time that the number
of cable news channels has expanded, exact comparisons of this
year's audience with the past audiences are difficult.
</P>
<P>
   But there are signs of lack of interest. Even though CBS and NBC
tried a bait-and-switch technique the first two nights to try to
lure viewers _ by folding the coverage inside its news magazines _
the audience defected in huge numbers as soon as convention
coverage started. ABC, the one network duplicating its coverage
from 1996, saw its ratings fall about 25 percent, compared with the
first two nights four years ago.
</P>
<P>
   On CBS, the program ``60 Minutes II'' offered a repeat segment
on dot-com millionaires for the first half-hour and drew a 4.6
rating. That fell to a 4.1 once the convention coverage came on.
(Each rating point represents just over 1 million homes.)
</P>
<P>
   The falloff was more drastic at NBC, where a ``Dateline''
segment on nursing homes drew a 7.2 rating in the first half hour.
The second half hour of convention coverage lost almost half that
audience, falling to a 3.8 rating.
</P>
<P>
   ``Here you had John McCain, one of the heroes of the campaign,
speaking and, zowie, half the audience is gone,'' Heyward said.
</P>
<P>
   He also cited CNN's falloff in viewers from 1996 _ a decline of
35 percent the first night and 17 percent the second night. Partly
this is due to increased competition from Fox News and MSNBC.
</P>
<P>
   CNN executives argued that they have been totally satisfied with
the ratings so far. ``We got a big bounce over our normal
ratings,'' said Susan Binford, the spokeswoman for CNN. ``And we
increased our numbers from the first night to the second. We think
the networks are engaging in a self-fulfilling prophecy in sending
out the message that the conventions are boring.''
</P>
<P>
   Money is not at the heart of the network decisions to cut back,
Heyward said, though he said network expenses in covering the
event, put at $15 million each in the 1980s, are now down to single
digit millions.
</P>
<P>
   Heyward said, ``If things don't change, I could see a scenario
where the candidates' acceptance speeches become the only events
covered live in 2004.''

TEXANS, `LOUD AND PROUD,' PUTTING ON A GLITZY SHOW IN PHILLY
</HEADLINE>
  (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
 By BUD KENNEDY 
 c.2000 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHILADELPHIA _ In a late-breaking news bulletin from the
Republican National Convention, the three major networks have
learned that Texans can look really stupid.
</P>
<P>
   Texans can look stupid waving their cowboy hats and howling like
drunken cowboys at a wet T-shirt contest. Texans can look stupid
praying, as a few did Tuesday night in a petty protest against a
gay congressman giving a speech about free trade. Texans can even
look stupid when sitting still, particularly if adorned with Lone
Star flag sequined jackets and enough rhinestones to temporarily
blind Brit Hume.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. Sen. John McCain even asked the Texas delegates to sit down
and stop waving their hats during his speech Tuesday night.
Supposedly, he couldn't see the TelePrompTer.
</P>
<P>
   If only he could have calmed them down to start the week.
</P>
<P>
   And those get-ups. I'm not sure who is the worst-dressed here _
the Texas delegates or the street protesters.
</P>
<P>
   Bill Eastland, an Arlington alternate and the city's favorite
anti-tax crank, only grinned about the Texans' hokey show.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're loud and we're proud,'' he said. ``Hokey? We're Texans.
We LIKE hokey.''
</P>
<P>
   Speaking of hokey: At the time, he was standing in an old Army
National Guard mounted cavalry horse barn, at a party featuring
barbecued brisket, pork ribs and plenty of Shiner Bock. On stage,
Jerry Jeff Walker had just finished singing ``London Homesick
Blues'' and was going into ``Up Against the Wall Redneck Mother.''
</P>
<P>
   It may or may not console you to know that this party for Ennis
Congressman Joe Barton and 1,400 invited guests was thrown by
America's gas utility companies.
</P>
<P>
   It's not even the largest Texas barbecue this week.
</P>
<P>
   At a convention where the star is Texas Gov. George W. Bush, the
only serious conflict of the week may be at the buffet tables. Call
it the Battle of the Barbecue.
</P>
<P>
   For Wednesday's smoker showdown, Barton chose fellow Aggie and
Texas House candidate Charlie Geren of Fort Worth, who weighed in
with 450 pounds of beef brisket, 120 pounds of chicken and 120
pounds of sausage from his Railhead Smokehouse restaurant.
</P>
<P>
   ``Barton tried my barbecue at a party once, and he liked it,''
Geren said, hustling to keep the meat warm with Sterno pots because
there was no place to connect a power generator in the 1916-vintage
Pennsylvania State Armory cavalry barn.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hope I can keep these Yankees from puttin' sauce on it.''
</P>
<P>
   Geren is not the only North Texas pitmaster in town. Dallas
barbecue caterer Eddie Deen, partner in the Ranch Hand BBQ
restaurant in Terrell, was firing up his pit Wednesday to feed the
national press corps traveling with Bush. Deen, a cousin to the
Deen Meat Co. family in Fort Worth and former Mayor Edgar Deen,
catered beef for 15,000 at both Bush inaugurations in Austin. A
local newspaper called him ``W's man for BBQ.''
</P>
<P>
   Deen studied molecular biology at A&AMP;M. ``I've spent a lot of
time figuring out how different smokers and different heat
temperatures affect the protein molecule,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Up here, though, what's important is to put on a good Texas
show.''
</P>
<P>
   The final cowboy throwdown will be Thursday night after the
convention, when House Majority Leader Dick Armey of Ennis throws a
party starring Brooks &AMP; Dunn and serving Capital Q barbecue from
Washington _ with help from Bush's new hometown hangout, the
Citrano Bros. Coffee Shop Cafe in McGregor near the Bush spread in
Crawford.
</P>
<P>
   Sammy Citrano was headed to town Wednesday. He's bringing a
smoker and barbecue fixin's for 4,000.
</P>
<P>
   He'll cook with hickory wood. If it runs low, he can stoke the
fire with all those hats.

BUSH AND CHENEY NOMINATED TO LEAD GOP BACK TO WHITE HOUSE  
</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)   
 By STEWART M. POWELL   
 c.2000 Hearst Newspapers   
PHILADELPHIA _ Republican convention delegates on Wednesday night
formally nominated George W. Bush to carry their hopes of regaining
the White House in the Nov. 7 election and affirmed former defense
secretary Dick Cheney as his running mate, clearing the way for
their campaign to receive almost $68 million in federal funds.
<TEXT>
<P>
   Cheney, accepting the nomination, immediately took the
offensive, telling the cheering delegates that the Clinton-Gore
administration ``squandered'' opportunities and gave ``little
purpose'' to the White House. The nation has become ``a little
weary of the Clinton-Gore routine,'' he declared.
</P>
<P>
   Bush, the two-term governor of Texas, watched the formalities
from his hotel suite surrounded by family members, including his
wife Laura, their twin 18-year-old daughters, his parents, former
President George Bush and Barbara Bush, and his siblings including
Florida Gov. Jeb Bush.
</P>
<P>
   Bush had taken the stage at the 22,000-seat convention hall a
few hours earlier to get familiar with the setting for his
acceptance speech on Thursday night. Bush, saying the 38-minute
address was ``ready to go,'' tested the convention hall sound
system with a stentorian recitation of his most essential line:
``My fellow Americans, I accept your nomination.''
</P>
<P>
   Republicans breathed a collective sigh of relief after word
spread that former President Gerald Ford, 87, was in stable
condition at the intensive care ward of a local hospital after
suffering one and possibly two small strokes. Ford had walked into
the Philadelphia's Hahnemann University Hospital under his own
power with a briefcase in hand about 9 a.m. after suffering slurred
speech, dizziness and weakness in an arm Tuesday night. Dr. Robert
Schwartzman, chief of neurology at the hospital, said Ford was
expected to recover.
</P>
<P>
   Cheney's address to the GOP convention gave the 59-year-old
former Wyoming congressman a chance to reintroduce himself to
America after being thrown on the defensive by Democratic criticism
of his conservative voting record during 10 years in the House
before he became President Bush's defense secretary in 1989.
</P>
<P>
   Cheney, stealing a cherished campaign line used by Al Gore
during his 1992 campaign, recited Clinton-Gore missteps and then
repeatedly declared, ``It's time for them to go.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Big changes are coming to Washington,'' Cheney promised during
his remarks that he crafted with the help of John McConnell, one of
Bush's most experienced speech writers. ``On the first hour of the
first day, (Bush) will restore decency and integrity to the Oval
Office.''
</P>
<P>
   Cheney readily conceded that he had ``never expected to be in
this position.'' But he said that he agreed to undertake his maiden
national campaign at Bush's side because ``I see in our nominee the
qualities of mind and spirit our nation needs _ and our history
demands.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush had announced his selection of Cheney in late July.
</P>
<P>
   Cheney addressed the Republicans on the 10th anniversary of the
Iraqi invasion of Kuwait that brought him to national attention as
a savvy wartime defense secretary during the Persian Gulf War.
</P>
<P>
   Karen Hughes, Bush's campaign spokeswoman, said the governor
hoped that Cheney's address would ``remind people that Secretary
Cheney is a statesman who brings a depth of experience to the
Republican ticket.''
</P>
<P>
   Hughes said Cheney's congressional voting record had been
``misrepresented'' by Democratic critics who were quick to portray
the ex-lawmaker as a conservative opposed to abortion rights, the
Headstart early education program, gun control and environmental
standards.
</P>
<P>
   Bush aides said they were buoyed by ongoing polling that showed
the Bush-Cheney ticket gaining strength against a ticket led by
Gore. A Voter.com-Battleground survey showed the Bush-Cheney ticket
widening its margin from 8 percentage points over the weekend to 13
percentage points in polling that ended Tuesday night.
</P>
<P>
   Bush led Gore 49 percent to 36 percent in a four-way match-up
that included Green Party candidate Ralph Nader, who had 4 percent,
and Reform Party contender Pat Buchanan who had 1 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Republicans' formal nomination of Bush and Cheney cleared the
way for their campaign to immediately receive $67.6 million in
federal funds to conduct their campaign through election day. Bush
receives the federal funds despite privately financing his primary
campaign with more than $80 million raised from donors in an
unprecedented financial juggernaut that left his rivals, including
Sen. John McCain, R-Ariz., in the dust.
</P>
<P>
   Sharon Snyder, spokeswoman for the Federal Election Commission,
said the Bush-Cheney campaign could receive a wire transfer of the
federal funds from the U.S. Treasury as early as Thursday,
following approval by the six-member commission. The GOP had
already received $13.5 million to stage the convention. ``We're
ready to go,'' Snyder said. &QC; 
Federal law provides that both major parties receive the same
amount of federal funding when they have selected their nominees.
The law limits the candidates to spending that amount, though
so-called soft-money spending by parties and political action
groups are unlimited.
</P>
<P>
   Bush, sweeping into Philadelphia from a five-state, five-day
barnstorming tour of swing states, rang a replica of the Liberty
Bell at the airport and quickly reached out to the nation's
influential Hispanic community by addressing a rally of Hispanic
Republicans in English and Spanish.
</P>
<P>
   Standing before a banner at the Philadelphia Museum of Art that
declared ``a new day'' in Spanish, Bush told several thousand
supporters gathered at the top of stone steps made famous in the
``Rocky'' series of movies that ``there's a better day for America;
there's a better day for all.'' Bush added in Spanish and English:
``Together we can win in November.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush also kept up the GOP's torrid pace of campaign fund raising
pace with an appearance at a $10 million luncheon gala that will
benefit the Republican National Committee's efforts to help both
the Bush-Cheney ticket and Republican candidates for the House and
Senate.
</P>
<P>
   Bush stood before a giant projection of the White House's South
Lawn that made it look as though he and Cheney were actually
standing on the lawn looking back toward the executive mansion that
has been inhabited since then-Arkansas Gov. Bill Clinton ousted
President Bush in 1992.
</P>
<P>
   Bush offered his cadre of well-heeled donors a ``report from the
field'' based upon triumphant visits since last Friday to Arkansas,
Missouri, Kentucky, Ohio and West Virginia. ``Let me tell you what
I'm seeing and what I'm feeling _ I'm feeling America is ready for
a change,'' Bush told his delighted audience. ``They don't want
four more years of Clinton-Gore. ... America is hungry for new
leadership and that is exactly what Dick Cheney and I are going to
give them.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush added: ``If all goes well _ if all goes well _ you're
looking at the next president of the United States.''
</P>
<P>
   GOP chairman Jim Nicholson told the Republican donors that he
had ``never seen a party more united and more resolved to win.''
</P>
<P>
   The violent protests that rocked Philadelphia on Tuesday,
leading to at least 350 arrests, sharply abated Wednesday, with
small platoons of protesters carrying out mostly peaceful
demonstrations.

KANSAS REJECTS SCHOOL BOARD CANDIDATES WHO FAVOR CREATIONISM
</HEADLINE>
 By PAM BELLUCK   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   CHICAGO _ Voters in Kansas have repudiated the state school
board's removal of human evolution from the state science
standards, making it all but certain that the decision will be
overturned.
</P>
<P>
   In a Republican primary on Tuesday, the voters defeated three
conservative candidates who supported the decision, made by the
Kansas Board of Education a year ago. In the first board election
since then, voters chose instead three moderate Republicans who
pledged to return evolution to the science standards. And those
three will be running in November against Democrats who also
support evolution. The election assures that there will be a
majority on the board supporting evolution.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think parents want their kids to have a strong competitive
education,'' said Sue Gamble, a moderate Republican who defeated
the school board chairwoman, Linda Holloway, a conservative. ``The
message was that that includes a full set of science standards and
that includes evolution.''
</P>
<P>
   While the board vote last August did not prevent schools from
teaching evolution, leaving that decision to schools, it
effectively removed evolution as the sole explanation for the
origin of species, as well as the Big Bang theory of the origin of
the universe, from state student assessment tests, a move was
intended to discourage teachers from spending time on those
subjects.
</P>
<P>
   Last year's 6-4 decision was considered one of the most
significant victories for those who believe that the species were
created by God or conservatives who favor an ``intelligent
designer.'' Proponents of such theories have stepped up their
activism, prompting states like Kentucky and Oklahoma to dilute the
teaching of evolution in one way or another. Many other states,
wrestling with evolution debates of their own, had their eyes on
Kansas.
</P>
<P>
   ``Kansas has been sort of ground zero,'' said Ralph G. Neas,
president of People for the American Way, a civil liberties group
that supports the teaching of evolution. ``And a lot of states will
be taking a look at this very seriously.''
</P>
<P>
   The issue had transformed a normally obscure election into a
lightning rod for proponents and opponents of evolution.
</P>
<P>
   Campaigns that normally raised no more than a few hundred
dollars received tens of thousands of dollars in contributions,
some from out of state. Candidates took the unusual step of running
television commercials.
</P>
<P>
   And Democrats switched parties just to vote in the Republican
primary, which, in heavily Republican Kansas, often determines who
will win in November. One Democratic school board member, Bill
Wagnon of Topeka, even campaigned for Gamble, even though she faces
a Democratic opponent in November.
</P>
<P>
   In the end, only one of the four conservatives running won,
Steve Abrams of Arkansas City, a board member who helped write the
standards approved last year. In a fifth district, Wagnon, was
unopposed in the Democratic primary, but faces a conservative
opponent in November. The remaining five board seats were not up
for election this year.
</P>
<P>
   Holloway, the former chairwoman who lost her seat in the
district that includes Kansas City suburb of Johnson County, said
she ``had no idea it would be that much of a defeat.''
</P>
<P>
   Holloway, who believes that evolution can be taught alongside
creationism or other theories, said, ``There is clearly still a
misunderstanding of what we did. There is still this stereotype
that this is religion and this is science. It was much more
complicated.''
</P>
<P>
   She blamed ``this elite group in Washington that have an agenda,
the National Academy of Sciences and other science groups. They
have an agenda to get evolution presented as hard dogmatic fact. It
is pure dogma and it is pure propaganda.''
</P>
<P>
   Although she raised $90,000 to Gamble's $36,000, Holloway said
she was ``outspent'' because Greg Musil, a moderate Republican
candidate for the congressional district that borders Kansas City,
ran campaign ads criticizing the board's decision. (Musil lost to
state Rep. Phillip D. Kline, who will face the incumbent Democratic
congressman, Dennis Moore.)
</P>
<P>
   ``One thing I'm very elated about is I don't believe the
discussion about evolution will ever be the same again,'' Holloway
said. ``People are looking at it with a more critical eye rather
than swallowing it hook, line and sinker.''
</P>
<P>
   Phillip E. Johnson, a law professor at the University of
California at Berkeley who believes that the universe is so complex
that there must have been an ``intelligent designer,'' said, ``I
think that the academics and the journalists succeeded pretty well
in embarrassing the people of Kansas and there was a sense that
`people are laughing at us, people think we're rubes, industry
doesn't want to come here anymore.'''
</P>
<P>
   He said, ``This is very heavy-handed intimidation. You may scare
people, but if anything, it may make people more likely to stand up
for their cause.''
</P>
<P>
   But in Kansas and across the country, science educators rejoiced
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am relieved and I'm also thinking that we're back on the
road to reality and sanity,'' said Al Frisby, a biology teacher at
Shawnee Mission Northwest High School in the Kansas City suburbs.
</P>
<P>
   Wednesday, Frisby wore a tie that summed up his feelings. It
featured three see-no-evil, hear-no-evil, speak-no-evil monkeys,
with hands covering the eyes, ears or mouth. A fourth monkey's
mouth was agape.
</P>
<P>
   ``I feel like the first three monkeys represent the conservative
school board members,'' he said. ``They had their eyes closed, they
had their ears closed, they had an agenda they were trying to
follow. And I'm the monkey at the bottom, saying, `Wow, it's
remarkable.'''

WHERE'S THE BEEF? 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By ADRIAN WALKER  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Well, they are the party of Lincoln, lest we forget.
</P>
<P>
   The only mildly unexpected occurrence in the surprise-free
Republican National Convention this week has been the persistent
effort of the GOP to keep all of us from staring underneath that
big tent George W. Bush keeps talking about.
</P>
<P>
   For the Republicans, it's minority week.
</P>
<P>
   Colin Powell made sense. Everyone likes the idea of Colin Powell
_ perhaps because almost no one knows where he stands on any
substantive political issue. But Condoleezza Rice? Can you honestly
say you knew who she was before Tuesday?
</P>
<P>
   I wonder, though, when the Republicans will get beyond trotting
people out and turn to doing something that might be meaningful for
people of color. For now, as only Rev. Jesse Jackson would put it,
``You got Colin Powell making speeches, but you got Trent Lott
making policy.''
</P>
<P>
   Powell, whose public political pronouncements have been mostly
confined to his brave support for volunteerism, finally embraced
the role so many have longed for him to play: front man, for a
party that has had few prominent black faces up front.
</P>
<P>
   Rice, Bush's chief foreign policy adviser, followed Powell on
Tuesday night by assuring us that her candidate is a tough guy who
will stand tall against our enemies, never mind all that talk about
his lack of ``gravitas.''
</P>
<P>
   National political conventions long ago mutated into television
shows, then pep rallies, a moment to put forth the best possible
face of a candidate. For the Republicans, still smarting from the
lessons of eight years ago, that means convincing America that they
aren't the party that hates women, minorities, and gays. Bully for
them.
</P>
<P>
   Between Reconstruction and the Depression, many blacks regularly
voted Republican, largely out of loyalty to the president who freed
the slaves. FDR changed that, and the civil rights movement that
followed made the exodus permanent. Despite all the social changes
of the past two generations, nothing has ever shaken the allegiance
of most of black America to the Democrats.
</P>
<P>
   In fairness, Bush has spent a considerable part of his down time
since he vanquished John McCain attempting to prove that
``compasssionate conservatism'' has something to say to those who
have long had no use for his party.
</P>
<P>
   He has offered to overhaul the Immigration and Naturalization
Service, to make it more compassionate to immigrants. He has touted
the improved test scores of black students in Texas. His campaign
has made sure we know he got 27 percent of the black vote when he
won election to his second term as governor in 1998.
</P>
<P>
   Still, W. has a tough row to hoe. Both his father, in 1992, and
Bob Dole, in 1996, barely broke into double digits among black
voters. Given the enormous popularity of the Clinton presidency
among blacks _ a popularity I'm not sure Clinton's policies fully
deserve _ George W. Bush doesn't figure to do much better than the
first George Bush. Bill Bradley thought he could make a run at the
black vote running against Al Gore in the primaries, and he has
been on vacation for months.
</P>
<P>
   Black America has a strange relationship with both parties, but
especially the GOP. Even black Republican candidates, such as they
are, win only sporadic support from black voters. That isn't an
accident, and no roster of speakers will be enough to change it.
</P>
<P>
   But the token gestures just keep on coming. If not for a traffic
accident and a few other mishaps, Massachusetts Republicans would
be patting themselves on the back right now for recruiting Jack E.
Robinson as a Senate candidate, even though under the best of
circumstances he would have absolutely no shot at toppling Edward
M. Kennedy.
</P>
<P>
   I wonder what the minority voters who are meant to be swayed by
the images flickering on their TV screens will find in the
Republican platform to bolster a belief in George W. Bush. I wonder
if he believes his revolving-door death penalty policy is just the
thing to make me feel safer and more secure. I wish he would talk
in something other than platitudes about how he would pick his
Supreme Court nominees. And as long as he and his supporters are so
comfortable invoking legacy, I can't help remembering that part of
his father's legacy is Clarence Thomas.
</P>
<P>
   The Republicans seem to be having themselves a fine party, and
I'm glad to see some blacks on the guest list. But I have some
questions about what happens when the party's over.

HERGES MAKES MOST OF HIS OPPORTUNITY
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By BRIAN DOHN  
 c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   PITTSBURGH _ Right-hander Matt Herges remembers the conversation
in the Dodgers' clubhouse a month into spring training as if it was
just the other day.
</P>
<P>
   There was no room for Herges on the roster. There was no hope
for him as a 30-year-old rookie in an organization filled with
veteran relievers who had a much better track record. Herges
couldn't argue.
</P>
<P>
   Now, Herges is 8-0, has a 3.00 ERA, and is in the starting
rotation for a pennant race. That's the news manager Davey Johnson
delivered Wednesday when he announced lefty Carlos Perez was being
shipped to the bullpen.
</P>
<P>
   ``(Johnson) has given me opportunities, and as a ballplayer,
especially in the minor leagues where guys just want a chance, one
chance, so I don't want to disappoint him,'' said Herges, who will
start Tuesday against the Chicago Cubs. ``When I think about it,
it's overwhelming a little bit. I've never been more excited.''
</P>
<P>
   Herges made the Dodgers roster in spring training because
Johnson was worried about getting innings from his starters,
particularly Orel Hershiser and Perez. So he went with 12 pitchers.
</P>
<P>
   But even after that, Herges' standing with the Dodgers wasn't
cemented. He was expected to be sent to the minors after the
season-opening four-game series in Montreal. The Dodgers, in fact,
had arranged and paid for his plane ticket to Albuquerque but then
changed their minds. The club decided to send Perez to the minors
and activate Geronimo Berroa.
</P>
<P>
   Yet, when Herges returned to his hotel room in New York there
was a fax waiting for him. It was his itinerary to leave for
Albuquerque, which was inadvertently sent.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a very easy decision for me because the guy has pitched
as good as anybody on the staff,'' Johnson said. ``The guy has
pitched very well, and we want to improve our chances to win every
fifth day.''
</P>
<P>
   JEFF THANKS JEFF: When Dodgers closer Jeff Shaw earned the 150th
save of his career in Tuesday's win in the second game of a
doubleheader against the Pirates, he wanted to make sure kudos were
given to someone who's helped him along in his career path.
</P>
<P>
   While with the Cincinnati Reds, Shaw spent a lot of time picking
the brain of injured closer Jeff Brantley. Shaw went on to save a
league-best 42 games in 1997, saved 48 the next season and had 34
saves with the Dodgers last season.
</P>
<P>
   ``If it weren't for (Brantley) getting injured I would have
never got the opportunity,'' said Shaw, who has five saves and
hasn't allowed a run in nine appearances since the All-Star break.
``I would have been setting up in '97 and who knows where I'd be. A
lot of it goes to him because he could have easily rehabbed
somewhere else. But he sat right there beside me in '97 and taught
me how to close.''
</P>
<P>
   ODDS AND ENDS: As expected, the Dodgers activated utility
outfielder F.P. Santangelo and placed infielder Chris Donnels on
the 15-day disabled list with an injured right shoulder. But
Santangelo won't be available until Tuesday's game against the
Chicago Cubs because he's serving his five-game suspension from the
Wrigley Field fiasco. Donnels was batting .300 in nine games,
mostly appearing as a pinch hitter. ... Eric Karros started 103 of
the first 106 games but was given Wednesday off. Dave Hansen
started at first base. &QL;

MARKET PLACE: WITH EXECUTIVES IN DEMAND, RECRUITERS DEMAND EQUITY 
</HEADLINE>
  (Editors: Vivek Wadhwa, in second graf, is cq.) By REED ABELSON    
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   When Relativity Technologies began a search in the spring for a
new president, its equity was in great demand. Even before
negotiating with job candidates, it had to deal with the demand for
a stake from the executive search firms.
</P>
<P>
   Well aware that competition for top talent is fierce, Vivek
Wadhwa, the company's chief executive, planned to hire one of the
top firms. When he contacted two of them, Heidrick &AMP; Struggles
International and Christian &AMP; Timbers, he was surprised to find
that they wanted more than just a six-figure cash fee. Each asked
for a sizable equity position in his company, an up-and-coming
software developer based in Cary, N.C., that eventually plans to go
public.
</P>
<P>
   Wadhwa considered the price, nearly half a million dollars, too
high and refused. Instead, he chose Kathy Forbes, who runs a small
recruiting business in Atlanta. ``It's become insane,'' he said.
Companies like his are no longer selecting search firms, he says,
so much as the firms are picking them.
</P>
<P>
   Giving away an equity stake began as a way for companies without
much cash to compensate lawyers, consultants and recruiting firms.
But deluged with work in a tight labor market, executive recruiters
increasingly demand _ and get _ equity as a condition of performing
a top-level search for many private companies aiming to go public
or others whose stock seems particularly appealing.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've created this mantra: `You want to work with us, we have
to get equity,''' said Ted Martin, the founder of his own
recruiting firm in Chicago. In choosing an assignment, recruiters
now routinely consider how well a client's stock might do,
especially given the recent market swings. ``With all these new
technology companies, everybody wants to be in because you want the
home run.''
</P>
<P>
   Few executives seem to have taken Wadhwa's stance, refusing to
hand over a significant share of their company, but some have
bristled at the arrangement. ``You are going to run into clients
who think you're smoking weed,'' Martin admitted.
</P>
<P>
   Recruiters are well positioned to get what they want. Venture
capitalists and other investors are flooding start-ups with
capital, allowing companies to throw around large sums to pay
somebody to help run the business. Top recruiters have typically
demanded the equivalent of a third of the executive's first-year
pay package. With the booming stock market, those packages have
increasingly included a hefty portion of stock options or warrants,
and recruiters have begun in the last year or two to ask for a
third of that equity as well.
</P>
<P>
   ``These search firms are incredibly busy,'' said Charles
Johnson, a venture capitalist with Noro-Moseley Partners in
Atlanta, who generally recommends that the companies his firm has
backed pay the prevailing rate. An investor in Relativity, Johnson
suggested Heidrick for that search.
</P>
<P>
   Wadhwa, though, was surprised by the overheated environment for
his company's first major search. No neophyte, he had helped found
another company, Seer Technologies, in 1990 before leaving in 1997
to found Relativity and had spent more than 25 years in the
technology industry.
</P>
<P>
   Although the position of president had been open for more than a
year, after Matthew Szulik left in 1998 to become the president of
Red Hat, Wadhwa had been in no rush to fill it. As Relativity began
contemplating an initial public offering of stock, Wadhwa felt the
need for someone to help run the company. ``What I needed was a
good operations executive,'' he said. ``I hate details.''
</P>
<P>
   He initially turned to his board for some names, but soon
decided to approach an executive recruiter to find a president and
chief operating officer. He had met Jeff Christian of Christian &AMP;
Timbers, and had been impressed. ``Jeff was my first choice,''
Wadhwa said. ``He was in the lead by a mile.''
</P>
<P>
   Wadhwa had expected to pay about $100,000 for Christian's
services, but Christian also demanded equity equal to about a third
of what the new president would get in his first year. The least he
would take was 75,000 shares, according to Wadhwa. Those options
were worth $375,000, since the shares had been valued at about $5
each during the latest round of financing.
</P>
<P>
   Christian said search firms were entitled to an equity position
for their work. ``The philosophy that we had was there were lots of
ideas and lots of money, but there was a shortage of talent,'' he
said. Receiving warrants or options aligns his firm's interests
with those of its clients and the candidates it is recruiting, he
said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Search firms are becoming a little more like venture guys,''
he said. Wadhwa ``did not value the relationship of a good search
firm as others did.''
</P>
<P>
   Wayne Luke of Heidrick &AMP; Struggles also wanted cash and equity,
Wadhwa said. Heidrick declined to comment. But the firm does not
conduct searches for a chief executive or chief operating officer
for pre-public technology companies unless it receives warrants,
according to a spokeswoman.
</P>
<P>
   At the suggestion of Johnson, the venture capitalist, Wadhwa
then contacted Forbes. She, too, was interested in equity. ``I like
having skin in the game,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike the other recruiters, though, Forbes proved willing to
negotiate because she was more interested in the exposure the
search might offer. The two eventually struck a deal in which she
would get just 5,000 options, worth perhaps $25,000, and an $80,000
fee. ``It was worth it in this case,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Although Wadhwa was initially concerned about going with a less-
established recruiter, Forbes said she would devote more time and
energy to the task than the better-known firms. She quickly
supplied him with a list of names. Within weeks, Relativity hired
Michael J. Espina, who had been a senior executive with Computer
Associates International.
</P>
<P>
   Espina said he was not looking for a job and had turned away
calls from other recruiters. Even though Forbes was not at a ``big
name-brand'' firm, she was persistent, he said, and got him to
schedule a short meeting, which stretched on for six hours. About a
month later, he was on board.

CLINTON DELAYS FEDERAL EXECUTION IN RESPONSE TO NEW CLEMENCY
PROCEDURES 
</HEADLINE>
   By RAYMOND HERNANDEZ   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ President Clinton on Wednesday delayed what would
have been the first federal execution in nearly 40 years after the
the Justice Department issued new clemency procedures for inmates
on federal death row.
</P>
<P>
   Juan Raul Garza, a drug dealer from Texas who was convicted of
three murders seven years ago, was scheduled to be put to death by
lethal injection on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   The president's decision, however, postponed the execution to
give Garza time to take advantage of the new clemency guidelines.
He is now scheduled to be executed on Dec. 12 at the federal prison
in Terre Haute, Ind.
</P>
<P>
   Gregory Wiercioch, one of Garza's lawyers, said on Wednesday
night in a telephone interview that he planned to use the new
clemency procedures to ask Clinton to spare his client's life.
``Obviously, we are very pleased that the president has stayed the
execution,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Wiercioch also said that in seeking clemency from the president,
he would argue that members of minority groups like Garza, as well
as defendants in certain parts of the country, are far more likely
to face the federal death penalty than are other criminals.
</P>
<P>
   The Justice Department is finishing a report on whether such
disparities exist in the application of the federal death penalty,
and Wiercioch said he hopes the report will be completed before his
client's clemency hearing takes place.
</P>
<P>
   The data collected so far by the Justice Department indicates
that minorities make up more than three-quarters of the defendants
in federal capital cases and that federal prosecutors in five
districts have filed nearly half of the cases in which the federal
death penalty was an option.
</P>
<P>
   ``The information we have seen tells us that the color of a
defendant's skin and where the crime was committed are two
impermissible factors playing a major role in the governments
decision to seek death,'' Wiercioch said. ``But we need to see the
final conclusions of the study being conducted by the Department of
Justice.''
</P>
<P>
   The clemency procedures, which were approved by Attorney General
Janet Reno and Clinton, are the first in federal capital cases
since the federal death penalty was reinstated in 1988.
</P>
<P>
   The procedures call for giving death row inmates 120 days notice
of the date of their execution, along with 30 days from the time
they receive that notice to ask the president to commute their
sentence.
</P>
<P>
   The new guidelines also give lawyers for death row inmates an
opportunity to make an oral presentation to a clemency panel. The
clemency process, from the initial filing to the final decision,
will take 90 days. The rules also give the relatives of victims the
opportunity to make their own oral presentation to the clemency
panel, though only with the assistance of the prosecutors in the
case.
</P>
<P>
   The White House expects the Justice Department to complete a
review of the racial and geographical breakdowns of people on death
row within the coming weeks. The information will then be passed
along to Garza's attorneys for the clemency petition.
</P>
<P>
   It is far from clear what Clinton will ultimately decide. He has
been a supporter of the death penalty since his he was governor of
Arkansas, where he refused to commute several death sentences.
</P>
<P>
   But the report being prepared by the Justice Department is
almost certain to raise questions about the fairness of the way the
federal death penalty is applied not just in the Garza case but in
others as well. Twenty-one men are on federal death row.
</P>
<P>
   A White House official said it was necessary to postpone Garza's
execution in order to give him the same opportunity to use the new
clemency procedures that other death row inmates will now have.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is an incredibly weighty matter,'' the official said.
``Garza would have been treated differently from everyone else on
death row. This is far too important based on what happens in the
end or doesn't happen.''
</P>
<P>
   The president's power to pardon are absolute under the
Constitution. In Garza's case, the president's options include a
pardon, which would erase the criminal record, or commutation to a
life sentence.
</P>
<P>
   Garza, a high school dropout who is the son of migrant farm
workers, was the head of a drug-running operation that smuggled in
tons of marijuana from Mexico, the federal charges said. He was
convicted in 1993 in Brownsville, Texas, of ordering the execution
of three people.
</P>
<P>
   Garza has insisted that he was not responsible for the murders.
But in seeking clemency, his lawyers do not intend to argue that he
is innocent. Instead, they will maintain that it is unfair to put
Garza to death because the federal death penalty system, as it
currently operates, is discriminatory racially and ethnically and
unevenly applied across the nation.

TREASURY GIVES 30-YEAR BOND A REPRIEVE, AND PRICE FALLS 
</HEADLINE>
   By JONATHAN FUERBRINGER   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ The 30-year bond received a reprieve Wednesday, and
its fate is now probably in the hands of the next administration.
</P>
<P>
   In its announcement of the details of its quarterly auction of
Treasury notes and bonds, the government did not put the 30-year
bond, the one-time benchmark for Treasury interest rates, on the
endangered-species list, which surprised some investors.
</P>
<P>
   But some longtime bond market analysts, who have been reluctant
to believe that a president and Congress could keep government
surpluses running long enough to pay off most of the government's
$3 trillion of publicly held debt, now think that the demise of the
30-year bond is nigh.
</P>
<P>
   It is now possible, said Louis Crandall, chief economist at R.H.
Wrightson &AMP; Associates, to say that the public debt will shrink so
much in the next few years that the only bonds that might be left
will be those hoarded by investors unwilling to sell them back to
the Treasury.
</P>
<P>
   The reason for this is the sheer size of the government surplus,
which is now forecast to be $211 billion in the 2000 fiscal year,
which ends Sept. 30, and $228 billion in the 2001 fiscal year.
</P>
<P>
   About a month ago, President Clinton announced that the
projected surplus for the 2001 through 2010 fiscal years would be
slightly less than $4.2 trillion. Of that, $2.3 trillion is
expected to come from the Social Security system and the rest,
almost $1.9 trillion, from general tax receipts. Democrats and
Republicans both consider the Social Security surplus off limits
for tax cuts or spending programs. So that leaves $1.9 trillion to
finance the tax cuts and spending increases that the two parties
will fight over.
</P>
<P>
   What makes the demise of the 30-year bonds more plausible is
that it is not practical to sell them when the publicly held debt
could be eliminated in just more than a decade.
</P>
<P>
   So the pressure on the 30-year bond has been growing since last
August, when the Treasury first announced that it was considering
buying back some of its longer-term debt and would reduce the
amount of 30-year bonds it issued.
</P>
<P>
   The actual buybacks began early this year, and so far the
Treasury has repurchased $17.5 billion of bonds with remaining
maturities of 15 to 25 years. By the end of this year, the total
should approach $30 billion, with two buybacks of $1 billion to $3
billion each month.
</P>
<P>
   And some investors apparently thought that the Clinton Treasury,
in an effort to highlight its success in wiping out government
deficits and starting to pay off the public debt, would have
announced the next step for the 30-year bond Wednesday. When they
were disappointed, the price of the 30-year bond dropped a full
point as its yield, which moves in the opposite direction, jumped
to 5.79 percent, from 5.72 percent on Tuesday. The bond rallied
late in the day and finished down 18/32, to 106 30/32, with the
yield at 5.76 percent. The 10-year note rose 2/32, to 103 26/32;
its yield fell to 5.97 percent from 5.98 percent on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   The announcement these investors were waiting for was that the
Treasury would actively consider no longer issuing 30-year bonds,
similar to the announcement it made in May about one-year bills.
</P>
<P>
   Gary Gensler, the undersecretary of the Treasury for domestic
finance, said there was no need for any significant change either
in the Treasury's reduced pace of issuing new Treasury bills, notes
and bonds, or in its plan for buying back existing debt. He said
the reason was the large amount of government debt that the
Treasury had paid off so far _ $360 billion over three years _ and
the fact that the amount of maturing Treasury debt was still high
next year, $464 billion, and the year after, $382 billion.
</P>
<P>
   The Treasury did announce one small change: It will now include
callable Treasury securities in its buyback program. A callable
security can be repurchased on demand by the Treasury at a certain
date before its maturity. The Treasury also said it would buy back
securities with remaining maturities of 10 years or more.
</P>
<P>
   With the 30-year bond down to new issuance of just $15 billion a
year _ $5 billion of that next week _ a decision on its fate cannot
be far.
</P>
<P>
   Gensler, however, said Wednesday that it was Treasury policy
``to give the market ample notice should we decide to eliminate or
curtail a particular issue. We will continue to follow that
practice.''
</P>
<P>
   So it is likely that the next administration will decide the
fate of the 30-year bond. The current one has one more chance, at
the next quarterly news conference announcing Treasury intentions,
on Nov. 1, the Wednesday before Election Day.

 &HT;    Spanish teams still spending
 &HT;    By Wendy Parker
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ The spending spree in Spain continues. And the arms
race between mortal enemies Real Madrid and Barcelona is heating up
to what could be astronomic proportions by the time the transfer
period ends later this month.
</P>
<P>
   A week after Madrid pried Portuguese midfielder Luis Figo right
out from under it, Barcelona used most of the world-record $56
million transfer fee to reshape its attack. The Arsenal midfield
duo of Emmanuel Petit and Marc Overmars cost a combined $43
million, and young Spanish midfielder Gerard Lopez comes from
Valencia for another $20 million.
</P>
<P>
   On Tuesday, Barca made world player of the year Rivaldo the
richest player on the planet by re-signing him to a three-year deal
worth around $6 million a year.
</P>
<P>
   Real Madrid hasn't slowed down, either. A Madrid sports daily
reported Tuesday that Real is vying for Zinedine Zidane, the French
midfield maestro. The proposed deal is $50 million and midfielder
Flavio Conceicao, who led Deportivo La Coruna to the Spanish title
and is a prime target of Juventus, Zidane's employer.
</P>
<P>
   Argentine midfielder Fernando Redondo, facing the prospect of
reduced playing time with Madrid because of recent acquisition
Figo, quickly moved to AC Milan for nearly $17 million.
</P>
<P>
   Valencia, European runner-up to Real Madrid, is staying busy,
too, albeit more modestly. French captain Didier Deschamps and
Atletico Madrid castoff Ruben Baraja will replenish the midfield,
and Slovenian striker Zlatko Zahovic signed for a bargain at $8
million.
</P>
<P>
   For the moment, the dizzying activity has been a two-nation
deal. In Spain and Italy, the egos of flamboyant club chairmen are
providing equally gluttonous fans with star-studded lineups, no
matter the price. It also helps that clubs can sign their own
television contracts, providing the richer clubs with even more
cash.
</P>
<P>
   In England, TV revenues are shared and teams are run as
button-down, bottom-line businesses, not glorified social clubs.
That mentality prevails even at Manchester United, the richest club
in the world. Its crosstown rival at Manchester City, just promoted
to the Premier League, dropped $6.5 million Tuesday for Paulo
Wanchope, West Ham's Costa Rican striker. It wasn't much less than
United spent for French goalkeeper Fabien Barthez, its only major
addition.
</P>
<P>
   The departure of Petit and Overmars from Arsenal wasn't
surprising, because they had been unhappy with the London club. But
after only a season in the Premier League, 20-year-old striker
Robbie Keane is leaving Coventry City for Inter Milan, where his
playing time isn't guaranteed. A $20 million transfer fee was too
hard to pass up. Keane joins a crowded front line of Christian
Vieri, Ivan Zamorano and newly signed Turk Hakan Sukur; Ronaldo
might miss another season with a knee injury.
</P>
<P>
   Stewards of the English game have been bemoaning influx of
foreign players in recent years. The greater worry might be the
exodus of some of its best homegrown talent to the continent.
</P>
<P>
   BLATTER: ROTATE CUP SITES
</P>
<P>
   FIFA boss Sepp Blatter will unveil his plans for rotating World
Cup sites today when the executive committee convenes in Zurich for
a three-day FIFA Congress. The reception could be chilly. It is
essentially the same 24-man gang that voted 12-11 last month to
award the 2006 site to Germany over South Africa.
</P>
<P>
   The one abstention, New Zealand's Charles Dempsey, resigned his
post under pressure, and the South African organizing committee has
vowed to push for an arbitration process. Blatter, who spent
enormous political capital campaigning for South Africa, said the
2006 decision won't be overturned but the World Cup should be
hosted evenly across all six confederations in the future.
</P>
<P>
   ENGLAND: GINOLA GOES TO VILLA
</P>
<P>
   Two years ago, he was the Premier League's player of the year.
But last season, French midfielder David Ginola quickly fell out of
favor with Tottenham manager George Graham. On Monday, he completed
a move to Aston Villa and parted with some choice words for the
taciturn Graham, who responded in kind.GERMANY: EFFENBERG SAYS NO
</P>
<P>
   Despite persuasions from new coach Rudi Voller, Bayern Munich
midfielder Stefan Effenberg says he won't play for Germany again. .
. . Borussia Dortmund defender Stefan Reuter will miss three months
with a knee injury, putting a dent in new coach Matthias Sammer's
rebuilding efforts. . . . Alexander Zickler netted a hat trick as
Bayern Munich routed Hertha Berlin 5-1 Tuesday to win the German
League Cup.
</P>
<P>
   BRAZIL: VICTORY EASES ANXIETY
</P>
<P>
   A convincing, emotional 3-1 victory over Argentina last
Wednesday put Brazil back on track in World Cup qualifying and
might have saved the job of coach Wanderley Luxemburgo. But he
still has a tall task, with one-third of the South American
schedule complete. Two goals from Vampeta paced Brazil in Sao
Paulo, but Luxemburgo, who has employed a revolving door roster,
doesn't have a lethal striker to play with Rivaldo. Captain Cafu
has feuded openly with the coach, and the Brazilian press is still
obsessed about a loss to Paraguay last month, only the second,
ever, in qualifying for Brazil. An Aug. 15 trip to Chile could be
revealing.

 By NICHOLAS D. KRISTOF and FRANK BRUNI   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHILADELPHIA _ Six years ago, when George W. Bush ran for
governor of Texas, even his parents expected him to lose. Friends
and relatives say that the elder Bushes worried that George W.
would be forced to bow again, as he had several times before, to
failure.
</P>
<P>
   But that story had a surprise ending: George W. won, and in the
process launched himself, without any grand plan or intricate
forethought, on a trajectory that on Thursday will place him in the
spotlight here as the Republican nominee for president, continuing
along what historians may some day recall as a most remarkable path
to the White House.
</P>
<P>
   Bush is almost an accidental candidate, a cocky and cheerful
fellow who drifted through much of his life and who was largely
unknown in America until he assumed his first political office in
1995. Yet he now leads the polls and will have, if elected, one of
the thinnest resumes in public service of any president in the last
century.
</P>
<P>
   There still is a great deal about his beliefs and leadership
style _ about the kind of president he would be _ that remains
unknown.
</P>
<P>
   He is a man who sometimes tortures the English language,
puzzling audiences with references to the ``vile'' hemisphere''
(instead of ``vital'') and tailpipe ``admissions'' (instead of
``emissions''), and mystifying a group of schoolchildren during
National Perseverance Month with when earnestly counseled them,
``You've got to preserve,'' as if they should all rush out to can
tomatoes. His odd grammar syntax challenges journalists trying to
quote him, because his subjects and verbs often disagree.
</P>
<P>
   Yet he has a dazzling charm, tremendous social skills, a bold
self-confidence, growing political savvy, great popularity among
the Texans who know him best _ and a past littered with opponents
who underestimated him. Those who have worked with Bush, Democrats
as well as Republicans, mostly say that contrary to all the jokes,
he is smart, shrewd and a quick study.
</P>
<P>
   The paradoxes go on. He is the law-and-order candidate, the
amiable governor who presides over a stream of executions, the
preacher of traditional moral values, the mover behind a convention
that called for giving young people the ``moral strength'' to
resist drugs. And yet he was arrested twice in college for pranks,
and he avoided military service in Vietnam, abused alcohol and
dances around questions in ways that suggest that he used illegal
drugs himself.
</P>
<P>
   He steers a profoundly conservative path. And yet he can startle
lily-white Republican audiences full of stout women in pearls with
sympathetic remarks about Mexican immigrants.
</P>
<P>
   He is the ultimate outsider candidate, dripping with scorn about
the ways of Washington and disdainful of Ivy League institutions,
always deeply proud of his frontier roots in the rattlesnake
country of Midland, Texas. And he is the ultimate insider
candidate, a Yale and Harvard graduate whose Rolodex brims with the
names of corporate and political titans.
</P>
<P>
   Like most Republicans, he rejects quotas used for affirmative
action as unfair. Yet he himself was a beneficiary of the
affirmative action enjoyed that in the 1950s that helped boys like
him get into high schools like Andover or colleges like Yale,
because their fathers had gone there before. If Bush has an
ideology, it is personal, not political; it is simply loyalty. It
is a deep loyalty to his father and to friends who have stood by
him and his family. Many of his top aides have been friends for
many years or decades, and loyalty was again a subtext when Bush
chose as his running mate Dick Cheney, the defense secretary under
President Bush. The Texas governor was not merely going to restore
honor and integrity to the White House, as he pledged in many a
stump speech. He was going to reunite the personnel.
</P>
<P>
   Better than virtually any other politician in America today,
Bush reflects Kipling's ideal _ ``If you can talk with crowds and
keep your virtue, or walk with kings _ nor lose the common touch.''
He has already hobnobbed with Queen Elizabeth II and gets along
equally brilliantly with beer-bellied baseball fans; he would be a
gold medalist in small talk if it were an Olympic sport. Yet he is
the scion of one of America's great most prominent political
families.
</P>
<P>
   (The word ``dynasty'' is taboo around the Bushes, arousing such
annoyance that its mention sometimes turns Bush's charm congealing
into something close to icy fury. But Bush is a direct descendant
of President Franklin Pierce on his mother's side and of a more
recent president on his father's side.)
</P>
<P>
   Bush often seems an echo of Shakespeare's Prince Hal, the
likable but dissolute son of King Henry IV. Hal sobers up when he
inherits the crown as Henry V _ and ultimately becomes a model
leader who is a better ruler for his past wildness. One of the most
interesting questions about Bush is whether he will grow in the
same way.
</P>
<P>
   Certainly there are signs that he has matured as power
approaches. For much of his life, his awesome people skills were
undermined by his volatile temper, his sharp tongue, his tendency
to hold grudges. But when he ran for governor in 1994, his
opponent, Ann Richards, thought it would be easy to goad him into
losing his cool and humiliating himself; instead he surprised his
friends and rivals alike with his steadiness under pressure and a
new-found discipline.
</P>
<P>
   That discipline and self-restraint were have been evident in a
taut campaign this year, in which Bush kept his temper in check and
relentlessly stayed ``on message.'' After a divisive primary
season, he managed better than many had expected unite the
Republican Party and get what he wanted in this convention.
</P>
<P>
   His name and connections helped him, of course, and without them
it is difficult to imagine that he would be a candidate today (a
proposition that Bush does not really argue with, although he hates
to talk about it).
</P>
<P>
   Bush's self-confidence leaves him one of the least neurotic
people on the planet, and also one of the least inclined to examine
himself. He glides along, glibly and optimistically, confident that
his innate cleverness will make up for whatever else he lacks,
deliberately ignoring the slings and arrows of his outrageous good
fortune.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't read half of what you write,'' he told the press corps
on his campaign plane last month.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't listen to half of what you say,'' one of the
reporters shot back.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's apparent,'' Bush replied, ``in the other half of what I
read.''

CITING BLOCKED MAIL, MARKET RESEARCHER SUES E-MAIL PROVIDERS 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Attn: N.Y., Calif.)   By LAURIE J. FLYNN   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Harris Interactive Inc., the nation's largest online market
research company, has filed a lawsuit against America Online and
other e-mail service providers charging those companies unlawfully
blocked e-mail from Harris to its survey participants.
</P>
<P>
   Harris says the service providers all subscribe to the Realtime
Blackhole List, an e-mail blocking service maintained by Mail Abuse
Prevention System, or MAPS, a not-for-profit company that tracks
e-mail abuse. The purpose is curbing unsolicited mass e-mail, known
as spam. MAPS, of Redwood City, Calif., is also named as a
defendant.
</P>
<P>
   Harris officials insist that the company does not send
unsolicited e-mail, and that all its participants register to take
part in its surveys. All survey participants, they said, have
several chances to opt out.
</P>
<P>
   The lawsuit, filed on Monday in U.S. District Court for the
Western District of New York, seeks an injunction removing the
block on its e-mail, and unspecified monetary damages. The suit
names more than a dozen companies, including Microsoft's HotMail,
Bellsouth, Juno Online Services and Qwest Communications. A hearing
for a temporary restraining order is scheduled for Thursday
afternoon.
</P>
<P>
   In a statement released Wednesday, MAPS officials said they were
surprised by the lawsuit.
</P>
<P>
   ``We believe we have every right to keep a list of people we
choose not to accept mail from,'' said Kelly Thompson, a
spokeswoman for MAPS, which was founded three years ago.
</P>
<P>
   Thompson said that MAPS did not itself block e-mail, but rather
that it keeps a list that e-mail service providers and other
companies can use to decide whom they should block. She confirmed
that Harris Interactive was on the Realtime Blackhole List, which
includes 3,000 names, because the company does not employ a purely
``opt-in'' approach. Harris counters that it gives users several
direct and easy opportunities to remove themselves from Harris'
participant list.
</P>
<P>
   The suit is not the first complaint filed against MAPS. Last
month, Yesmail.com, an e-mail marketing firm, sued MAPS for being
included on the Blackhole List, but that suit was put on hold after
both sides agreed to work together to clarify their approach to
mass e-mail.
</P>
<P>
   America Online, however, insists it does not use the Realtime
Blackhole List as part of its anti-spam activities, and said that
there was no basis for Harris Interactive to have named AOL in its
lawsuit.
</P>
<P>
   Furthermore, said Rich D'Amato, a spokesman for AOL, ``We are
confident our spam-fighting techniques are entirely appropriate.''
</P>
<P>
   D'Amato said ``it was possible'' that AOL was blocking e-mail
from Harris, but added that AOL would only take such action if
Harris violated AOL's spam-fighting standards, not those of MAPS.
</P>
<P>
   Gordon S. Black, chairman and chief executive of Harris
Interactive, said Harris had no other options but to file a
complaint, calling the MAPS actions ``completely arbitrary and
capricious.'' MAPS, he said, has no right to ``unilaterally
decide'' on appropriate anti-spam standards for the industry. ``The
whole thing is absurd, but costly absurd,'' he said. ``We sued in
part because we're as offended by the process as we are by the
action.''
</P>
<P>
   The e-mail blocking comes at a particularly bad time for Harris,
which is preparing for two major election-related projects in
September, including creating a survey site for the Commission on
Presidential Debates. ``This will make it difficult to do our
Election 2000 Project,'' Black said, referring to a huge online
survey of voter preferences.
</P>
<P>
   Harris' suit also includes an antitrust complaint against AOL,
given that its own online market-research company, Digital
Marketing Systems, is a direct competitor to Harris.
</P>
<P>
   Harris Interactive, based in Rochester, N.Y., conducts more than
1.5 million surveys every quarter. Of Harris Interactive's 6.6
million registered participants, roughly 2.7 million are affected
by the block, Black said.

SCIENTISTS FULLY MAP CHOLERA'S GENOME 
</HEADLINE>
   By NICHOLAS WADE   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The genome of the bacterium that causes cholera has been
decoded, paving the way for devising better vaccines and drugs
against a major killer, which has caused seven pandemics since
1817.
</P>
<P>
   With the genome sequenced, all of the 3,885 genes found in the
bacterium's inventory are now open for inspection, giving
biologists the basis for understanding every detail of the
microbe's evolution and its tricks for surviving in such different
conditions as the open ocean and the human gut.
</P>
<P>
   The genome was sequenced by the Institute for Genomic Research
in Rockville, Md., and is described in an article published
Thursday in the journal Nature.
</P>
<P>
   The bacterium turns out to have 4,033,460 units of DNA, arranged
in two circular chromosomes. The larger chromosome has the usual
housekeeping genes, which are similar to those of E. coli, a common
and usually harmless inhabitant of the human gut. The smaller
chromosome seems to contain many of the genetic elements that make
the cholera organism pathogenic.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. John Mekalanos, a microbiologist at Harvard University, said
he had used the cholera genome to make a gene expression chip, a
device that tests when any of the bacterium's genes are active. The
chip should help determine which genes are switched on when the
bacterium is growing in the human intestine. Such knowledge may
pinpoint ways to attack the bacterium, Mekalanos said.
</P>
<P>
   The cholera bacterium belongs to a family of microbes known as
Vibrio, which are found everywhere in the world's oceans. Most are
harmless, and the expression chip may help determine how Vibro
cholerae, the causative agent of the disease, acquired the means to
infect people.
</P>
<P>
   Pathogenicity seems to have arisen at least twice in history.
Most of the known cholera pandemics were caused by a strain of the
bacterium that has now disappeared, and has been replaced by a new
strain, the El Tor variety, Mekalanos said. The El Tor strain is
the one whose genome has now been sequenced.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Claire Fraser, director of the Institute for Genomic
Research, said the genome work had cost $740,000 and was financed
by the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases. The
grant was made to her, to Mekalanos and to Dr. Rita Colwell, now
the director of the National Science Foundation, who has worked for
many years on the oceanic distribution of Vibrio.
</P>
<P>
   The institute's scientists started work expecting the cholera
genome to consist of a single chromosome about 2 billion units of
DNA in length. But the published report on which they relied was in
error, Fraser said. The genome turned out to be twice as long and
its sequencing was therefore more costly than expected.
</P>
<P>
   The cholera genome is the 20th microbial genome the institute
has sequenced, of which 13 have been published and 6 are being
prepared for publication.

   California Short of Power In an Age of Deregulation
</P>
<P>
   Four years after it led the nation into a deregulation of the
electric industry, California is at the brink of a breakdown in its
power supply. The nation's most populous state nearly ran out of
power for the third consecutive day. What disturbs California
utility executives and regulators is that this week's crisis has
come even though none of the state's power plants or transmission
lines has failed, at a time when temperatures around the state have
been hot but hardly extraordinary. The state's power supply simply
can no longer keep up with peak demand, they warn.

   The Nasdaq composite index slumped as skittish investors sought
safety in blue-chip stocks or headed for the sidelines waiting for
Friday's report on the job market in July. The Nasdaq composite
fell 27.06 points, or 0.7 percent, to 3,658.46. The Dow Jones
industrial average rose 80.58 points, or 0.8 percent, to 10,687.53.

SPORTS COLUMN: THE ORIOLES PACK UP THE U-HAUL 
</HEADLINE>
   By MURRAY CHASS   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Mike Bordick was the first to go. He was sent away last Friday.
Mike Timlin followed him out the door the next day, and so did
Charles Johnson and Harold Baines. Last Monday Will Clark and B.J.
Surhoff joined them. In 75 hours, a long weekend, the Baltimore
Orioles chopped 74 years of major league service from their roster.
</P>
<P>
   Not to mention nearly $25 million in salaries for the rest of
this and future seasons. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``I was a little surprised that they got rid of B.J.,'' Bordick,
the Mets' rental shortstop, said Tuesday, the day after the Orioles
traded Surhoff to Atlanta. ``I guess it came to the point where
they had to do something drastic. Unfortunately, the last few years
they haven't been very successful. They had to make some drastic
changes, and they certainly did that.''
</P>
<P>
   The Orioles won the American League East championship in 1997,
marking the second successive season they reached the playoffs. But
in the two subsequent seasons they spent nearly $1 million per
victory in player payroll and had nothing to show for it. Their
payroll for those two seasons totaled $147 million, and they won
157 games while finishing fourth both years, a total of 55 games
from first.
</P>
<P>
   When Peter Angelos, the Orioles' owner, awoke last Friday, he
again found his team in fourth. It was baseball's version of
``Groundhog Day,'' and Angelos was Bill Murray.
</P>
<P>
   ``The results speak for themselves,'' Angelos said by telephone
of the Orioles' subsequent moves. ``There was an interest in
reconstructing the team, with the stress on younger players. With
so many teams in contention for the wild card as well as division
championships, there was a great opportunity to make beneficial
trades to further that goal.''
</P>
<P>
   The Orioles are no longer the team Bordick he thought he would
continue to play for, beyond the free agency he can have after this
season.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had been talking about that, being there,'' Bordick said.
``The one thing about myself is you start something and you hope to
finish it. There was some excitement there going to the postseason
in '97. Then obviously the frustrating time came after that.''
</P>
<P>
   What happened to the Orioles in the last three seasons? ``That's
what makes it so frustrating,'' Bordick said. ``We had so much
talent. Not to do what we hoped to do there was very frustrating.''
Bordick didn't feel the frustration any more deeply than Angelos,
who pays the large salaries. ``We had some great players,'' the
owner said, ``but the years go by. The years take their toll on
players who have done very well but who eventually aren't at the
performance level they once were.''
</P>
<P>
   The half-dozen players the Orioles traded have 2000 salaries
totaling $24 million. In the management and union method used to
compute season payrolls, the trades left the Orioles with a $61
million payroll, down considerably from the opening-day figure of
$81.5 million. In reality, the Orioles will save $7.2 million for
the rest of this season and avoid having to pay $17 million that
had been committed to future seasons for some of the traded
players.
</P>
<P>
   ``Money wasn't a consideration up front,'' Angelos said. ``It's
a consequence. We save substantial dollars in making the changes,
but those monies will be invested back into the recruitment of
additional players in order to present a competitive team next
season. These aren't dollars that are going into anyone's pockets.
Except the players. That's the inevitable destination of all the
dollars.''
</P>
<P>
   In other words, the Orioles weren't following in the grand
tradition of the San Diego Padres of the early 1990's and the
Florida Marlins of the 1997 World Series championship in decimating
the team just to slash the payroll.
</P>
<P>
   ``There will be a substantial number of first-rate players in
the forthcoming free agency group,'' Angelos said. ``We intend to
be involved heavily though carefully.'' &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Angelos was quick to explain the difference, as he sees it,
between the personnel actions of the 2000 Orioles and the 1997
Marlins.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think the Marlins had any choice but to do that,'' he
said, ``because their attendance and subsequent revenues have
always been sparse. We're in a totally different position. We're a
high-revenue franchise. Having those dollars available, we intend
to invest them in a team worthy of the fan support we get every
year. We're not in this game for profit. We provide entertainment
and make a statement for the city and the state.''
</P>
<P>
   Despite their noncontending status, the Orioles lead the major
leagues in attendance. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``The support absolutely is unequaled and we are obliged to
respond in a similar fashion,'' Angelos said. ``We have to give
them a winner, and we are going to give them a winner.'' &QL;

<P>
   NEW YORK _ In the absence of alternatives, there may be no more
important project under way in New York right now than David
Childs' restoration of Lever House, the International Style
skyscraper on Park Avenue at 54th Street. Designed by Gordon
Bunshaft and completed in 1952, Lever House was the first glass
curtain wall tower to rise in New York. It remains among the 20th
century's major landmarks.
</P>
<P>
   Lever House established Skidmore, Owings &AMP; Merrill as the most
progressive firm in the postwar United States. Along with the
Seagram Building, the Guggenheim Museum, the CBS Building and the
United Nations headquarters, it helped make New York the leading
city for architectural innovation in those years. Childs became
chairman of SOM in 1990. His homage to Bunshaft is no mere
sentimental journey. The restoration, due for completion this fall,
is uncovering qualities that are becoming valued in architecture
once again.
</P>
<P>
   ``Uncommon Ground,'' a book by Thomas Leatherbarrow, should help
admirers of modern architecture to form a more precisely analytic
appreciation of those qualities. Leatherbarrow, a professor of
architecture at the University of Pennsylvania, also provides a key
for interpreting contemporary work, including recent projects by
Childs, Rafael Vinoly and Peter Eisenman.
</P>
<P>
   The book, due in October from M.I.T. Press, is a revisionist
work. It corrects the distorted view that modern architects were
insensitive to the physical context of their buildings. Focusing on
projects by Richard Neutra and two less well-known figures, Antonin
Raymond and Aris Konstantinidis, Leatherbarrow shows that
modernists did not regard building sites simply as blank slates for
inscribing their fantasies of a uniform, technological society.
</P>
<P>
   Further, he contests the notion that modern architects were
latter-day Vandals, intent on shattering the cultural continuity of
regional and urban life. Rather, the best of them adapted
industrial building techniques to the lay of the land. Modern
design mediated between prefabricated construction and local
topography. It reconciled the homogenizing nature of modernity with
regional differences. Its aim was to prevent the shattering of
continuity in the industrialized world, not to accelerate it.
</P>
<P>
   In other words, Frank Lloyd Wright and Luis Barragan were not
the only architects who took landscape into account. Architects
like Neutra regarded the city as an evolving topography in which
landscape and successive layers of built form intersected over
time.
</P>
<P>
   But why use past tense? The International Research Institute for
Climate Prediction at Columbia University's Lamont-Doherty Earth
Observatory, completed earlier this year, perfectly illustrates
Leatherbarrow's ideas. Designed by Vinoly, the institute is the
most sensitively sited building I've visited since Tod Williams and
Billie Tsien's Neurosciences Institute in La Jolla, Calif. Both are
science buildings. Both command impressive natural, partially
urbanized sites. Both embody a conception of science as the culture
of nature.
</P>
<P>
   Vinoly's project is in Palisades, N.Y., on a cliff-top site on
the west side of the Hudson. The institute's design is as serenely
elegant as its name is clunky. Almost Wrightian in its relationship
to the landscape, the institute is composed of two arc-shaped wings
that overlap at the center, forming a double-width lobby area at
the building's entrance. The roof is also designed as two pairs of
overlapping arcs. A clerestory between the arcs illuminates the
corridor that bisects the full length of the building's interior.
</P>
<P>
   Leatherbarrow writes that the modern relationship between
construction and topography is best seen in section (a cutaway
drawing), rather than in plan (from above) or elevation (from
outside). The institute's central corridor offers a walk through
this idea. The ground on which the building sits slopes gradually
down toward the north. The land has not been leveled off. This is
translated into the interior by flights of steps that break the
corridor into segments.
</P>
<P>
   Materials and exposed structure further integrate construction
and site. The corridor runs beneath an arcade of wood bow trusses
that support the roof and create an outside-in impression of trees.
Internal office windows, facing into the corridor, pull light and
views into the core. Bearing walls are made from the same local
stone that erupts in boulders from the ground outside. The arcs of
the wings and the metal roof echo contours of land and water.
</P>
<P>
   According to Leatherbarrow, the conflict between technological
progress and cultural continuity exists only in theory, not in the
real world of architecture. Vinoly's building proves the point. The
Palisades were formed 200 million years ago. One of the functions
of the climate research institute is to monitor the global warming
that could result in their submersion. Try that on for continuity.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier this year, in a review of Peter Eisenman's design for
the Staten Island Institute of Arts and Sciences, I wrote that
Eisenman's buildings should be seen as links between the history of
places and the history of ideas. At the site of a recent design for
a hotel on the Friedrichstrasse in Berlin, these two histories
already run closely parallel. The Hotel am Spree Dreieck is a
homage to two unbuilt Berlin projects designed by Mies van der Rohe
in 1921 and 1922. The two projects were Mies' first explorations of
the glass tower, a type that culminated in the completion of the
Seagram Building 37 years later. Eisenman's plan, situated on the
exact spot of Mies' 1921 project (no site was designated for the
1922 project), takes the International Style tower back to its
Expressionist roots.
</P>
<P>
   In 1921, Mies had yet to rationally integrate steel construction
into his skyscraper aesthetic. His Berlin towers were as much
Expressionist as they were modern. Eisenman has essentially
reversed the course of Mies' later development. His design uses a
scientific technique to arrive at an Expressionist result. The
design was generated by computer. Mies' two Berlin designs were
loaded into the software and morphed into a single, composite
structure.
</P>
<P>
   The hotel combines the three-pointed star configuration of Mies'
1921 ground plan with the biomorphic contours of his 1922 scheme.
The result is indescribably sexy. As with Mies' projects, the
hotel's most prominent feature is the floor planes, stacked one
above the other like a theatrical multiplex of urban stages. It's
peek-a-boo time, not only for the hotel guests, but also for Berlin
and for Mies, its greatest 20th-century architect. The irrational
within the rationalist stands exposed. Eisenman's siteis the
history of modern architecture and of the role Berlin played in it
before Hitler came to power.

</P>
<P>
   The most conspicuous feature of the Lever House restoration is
the repair of the glass curtain wall. The spandrel glass,
originally a uniform green, had become a random two-tone mix. But
the restoration should also open our eyes to the fact that
Bunshaft's design involved more than wrapping a pretty skin around
some steel and concrete. The building's importance lies with the
integral relationship between skin, structure and site. At Lever
House, skin and section are one.
</P>
<P>
   The stretch of International Style towers along Park Avenue
south of 59th Street has been criticized for destroying Park
Avenue's sense of place. Precisely the opposite is true. The towers
revealed a deeper sense of place than the masonry buildings that
preceded them. Park Avenue is a feat of engineering: a viaduct for
cars suspended over the train tracks that run beneath. The machine
aesthetic of the towers raises this infrastructural dimension above
the ground.
</P>
<P>
   The exposed columns of Lever House punch through the thin crust
of sidewalk and convey the impression of stilts straddling the
subterranean tracks. The window mullions extend that vertical
thrust to the skyline. The tower's floating base and stacked floor
planes reveal that New York is a horizontal as well as a vertical
city. Each floor replicates the slice of ground beneath it.
</P>
<P>
   Apart from the advantage it takes of sunlight, Lever House does
not reflect the natural topography of Manhattan. Rather, the design
adapts construction to the artificial topography of a city that has
evolved over time. Lever House itself is part of the city's
accretive nature. So is its restoration. Half a century after its
completion, we see the building with fresh eyes.
</P>
<P>
   When new, Lever House was received as a sign of progress,
socially and aesthetically. Office workers benefited from the
natural light and the clear, open spaces. The city gained from
being among the first to realize the utopian ideal visualized by
Mies and other modernists. These qualities are still evident. But
they are enriched by our awareness of a psychological dimension
underlying the modern forms. Park Avenue is a CAT scan of New
York's collective brain: our ambition, our exhibitionism, our
compulsion to build platforms for our ideas. The city is more
upfront about these urges than it was 50 years ago. In that sense,
Lever House can stand for progress still.

PHILADELPHIA DIARY: A FUND-RAISER, A FAMILY REUNION AND THE ROCK 
</HEADLINE>
   By ALEX KUCZYNSKI AND MATTHEW PURDY   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHILADELPHIA _ It is your decision, America.
</P>
<P>
   Dinner at Alain Ducasse for two might set you back $500, but
lunch with Gov. George W. Bush and 3,099 of his best friends on
Wednesday ran to at least twice that at the Pennsylvania Convention
Center.
</P>
<P>
   But who needs foie gras poached in pepper court bouillon when
you can get soggy Caesar salad and a glass of bathtub-warm pinot
grigio (if you were one of the lucky ones).
</P>
<P>
   Bush chose to make his public party debut on Wednesday at the
Republican convention's biggest fund-raiser, which seemed in step
with Wednesday night's convention message of ``prosperity with a
purpose.'' The lunch certainly added to the party's prosperity,
raking in $10 million, party officials said.
</P>
<P>
   Bush and his wife, Laura, attended; so did his brother, Gov. Jeb
Bush of Florida, and Dick Cheney.
</P>
<P>
   Bush's nephew, George P. Bush, the thinking woman's Ricky
Martin, showed up and flashed his extremely white teeth and spoke
heart-melting Spanish with one woman.
</P>
<P>
   The lunch had the feeling of any fund-raiser: rubber chicken, an
earnest children's chorus (to which no one listened) and lots of
schmoozing. But there was one big difference for most of the donors
at the lunch, at least according to the wife of a governor who
pleaded for anonymity.
</P>
<P>
   Safely ensconced in the ladies room, she peered excitedly into
her plastic goody bag, the donor's version of a child's birthday
party bag. The contents: a notepad with a Republican National
Committee logo, a T-shirt and a Kit-Kat bar.
</P>
<P>
   ``You would think for that much money, you'd at least get a
bottle of perfume,'' she complained.
</P>
<P>
   Prosperity, alas, has its limits.
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A Familiar Face Returns
</P>
<P>
   With his familiar mop-top and full face, he could have been Pete
Rose at an old-timer's game the way fans angled for autographs and
snap shots with yesterday's hero.
</P>
<P>
   Newt Gingrich may be out, but he's not down.
</P>
<P>
   He's a member of the convention's overcrowded chattering class,
yakking online, on radio, on television.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm back to where I was before I was speaker, walking around
spreading new ideas,'' Gingrich said.
</P>
<P>
   The recent Gingrich idea that got the most attention was
registering online (at Web sites for Macy's and Williams-Sonoma)
for gifts for his coming wedding. But Gingrich said he and his
soon-to-be third wife were simply doing ``what most modern couples
do.''
</P>
<P>
   The ideas that really excite him these days are about science
and technology. He's studying and writing about technology,
advising corporations on strategic planning and, this week,
providing commentary on Fox Television.
</P>
<P>
   Gingrich wasn't invited to the convention podium. First off, as
he says, ``the Republican Party hardly needs to build its strength
among white males.'' His brand of conservatism, even within the
Republican Party, often seemed as compassionate as a nail gun. And
since he used his 1996 convention speech to talk most memorably
about beach volleyball, apparently none of this convention's theme
nights seemed like a perfect fit.
</P>
<P>
   So what if he doesn't have a leading role in the convention he
calls the beginning of ``chapter four of the modern conservative
movement.''
</P>
<P>
   After all, the third chapter was entitled ``The Contract with
America,'' he said with a satisfied smile.
</P>
<P>
   Protests Falling Flat
</P>
<P>
   Pity the protester.
</P>
<P>
   The crowds weren't overwhelming. The convention flowed smoothly.
Philadelphia residents actually cheered when the police arrested
them. Phildelphia, so far, doesn't compare to the protests over
world trade issues in Seattle, or even in Washington, D.C.
</P>
<P>
   ``Seattle was like a 9, because they declared martial law,''
said Henry Schwab, 27, a self-described traveling activist.
``Philadelphia's like a 4. D.C. was like a 5.5.''
</P>
<P>
   A Hispanic Welcome
</P>
<P>
   One of Bush's first stops on Wednesday was the Philadelphia
Museum of Art for what was billed as a Hispanic welcome event.
Latin music blared. But while Hispanic children were up on the
stage and Hispanics up front, the crowd was filled with a sizable
contingent of blond, non-Hispanic, College Republicans waving
``Viva Bush'' signs.
</P>
<P>
   One of them, David Standness, 21, said he was part of a bunch of
College Republicans who came by bus from Minnesota.
</P>
<P>
   Bush was introduced by his Hispanic-American nephew, George P.,
who said, ``Are you excited about electing a president who
represents the diversity of our society?''
</P>
<P>
   A Family Reunion
</P>
<P>
   About 60 Bush family members _ all the siblings, the parents,
most or all of the siblings' kids _ planned an early dinner at the
Ritz Carlton. For the Bushes, national political conventions have
become family reunions. One campaign aide who is staying near the
family ay the Wyndham Hotel described the scene as ``very
exuberant, with lots of children running up and down the hall.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a lot of fun for the cousins,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The Rock Growls Back
</P>
<P>
   It ain't easy being mean.
</P>
<P>
   Dwayne Johnson, aka the Rock, introduced Dennis Hastert, the
speaker of the House, at Wednesday night's session. Why?
</P>
<P>
   It seemed appropriate that the World Wrestling Federation's most
celebrated wall of meat, Johnson, would introduce Hastert, who was
once a wrestling coach.
</P>
<P>
   Not everyone was happy about the invitation. As the Rock was
practicing his recitation on the convention floor (``Can you
s-m-e-l-l what the Rock is cooking?'' he wailed into the
microphone, flexing his shoulders so the seams on his white dinner
jacket swelled), L. Brent Bozell, the president of the Parents
Television Council, was steaming.
</P>
<P>
   ``This will hurt the Republicans in more ways than they can
possible imagine,'' Bozell said in a telephone interview. ``Any
time a Republican gives a speech about raunch or violence, the
bottom of the barrel stuff, people will be able to point to the
Rock, and his introduction of Hastert, and they will be able to say
that the Republicans sponsored and approved of and celebrated the
biggest superstar of raunch and violence. How vastly stupid can
they be?''
</P>
<P>
   On CNN, the Rock slammed back at Bozell, calling him ``an
extremist who represents a radical organization.'' And he stared
into the camera and chewed out Bozell. ``Grow up,'' he said. ``What
we do is entertainment.''

FOR HARMONY, DALAI LAMA DECIDES TO SKIP PEACE CONFERENCE
</HEADLINE>
  By LAURIE GOODSTEIN   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ More than 1,000 eminent religious leaders from around
the world are expected to gather for an unprecedented conference at
the United Nations this month, but conspicuously absent will be the
Dalai Lama, spiritual leader of Tibetan Buddhism, who has been
excluded to avoid offending China.
</P>
<P>
   The Dalai Lama, winner of the Nobel Peace Prize in 1989, was
omitted from the initial invitation list for the Millennium World
Peace Summit of Religious and Spiritual Leaders, to be held in New
York Aug. 28 to 31.
</P>
<P>
   The conference, financed largely by Ted Turner and several
foundations, is the start of an initiative designed to link
religious leaders with U.N. efforts to help prevent, settle or heal
conflicts around the world.
</P>
<P>
   Some religious leaders are now saying that the exclusion of the
Dalai Lama illustrates the need for such a conference, as well as
its pitfalls.
</P>
<P>
   ``This compromises the integrity of the United Nations, and the
credibility of the summit,'' said Desmond Tutu, the retired
archbishop of Cape Town. ``Apart from anything else, the Dalai Lama
is the spiritual leader of a major religion, and it just doesn't
make sense that he has not been invited.''
</P>
<P>
   Bawa Jain, secretary general of the conference, said that China,
which is one of five permanent members of the Security Council, had
made it clear from the start that it would not approve of inviting
the Dalai Lama. The Dalai Lama fled Tibet in 1959 with thousands of
his followers after the Chinese invaded and has lived in exile in
India ever since.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's been very clear with the Chinese from Day 1,'' Jain said,
``and it's been very clear with the office of the secretary general
that within the political framework of the United Nations there are
certain constraints, and if you decide to have this event with the
U.N., then there are political constraints. Not that I agree with
it, but I abide by it.''
</P>
<P>
   At the United Nations, Manoel de Almeida e Silva, deputy
spokesman for Secretary General Kofi Annan, said, ``There are a
number of countries here that feel that certain issues are more
controversial, have political implications for them, and which they
are very sensitive about, and that certainly is the case with Tibet
for China.''
</P>
<P>
   Jain said that he met with the Dalai Lama last November in
Israel to discuss the conference. Jain said the dilemma was painful
because he has known the Dalai Lama since he was a boy in India and
studied with a Jain monk who was close to the Dalai Lama.
</P>
<P>
   Jain said the Dalai Lama gave the conference his blessings and
called it a unique opportunity that should proceed despite his
absence.
</P>
<P>
   But last month, news of the Dalai Lama's exclusion began to
spread through the international network of Tibet supporters, and
letters of protest arrived at the organizers' offices in New York.
</P>
<P>
   So late last month, five weeks before the conference, Jain
belatedly invited the Dalai Lama to deliver the keynote address at
the closing session, to be held not at the United Nations but at
the Waldorf-Astoria.
</P>
<P>
   But on Wednesday, organizers received a letter from the Dalai
Lama's secretary in Dharmsala, India, declining that offer but
promising to support the conference by sending a ``high-level
Tibetan delegation'' to represent him.
</P>
<P>
   Nawang Rabgyal, spokesman for the Dalai Lama in New York, said,
``His holiness has never been comfortable accepting invitations
that are made out of compulsion rather than willingly, and he has
always avoided embarrassing or causing inconveniences to anyone,
whether they are individuals or governments. And moreover the
invitation has come far too late. His holiness' program has been
finalized many months in advance.''
</P>
<P>
   Among those expected to attend are Cardinal Francis Arinze,
representing the Vatican; the Rev. Konrad Raiser, secretary-general
of the World Council of Churches; Israel's Ashkenazic chief rabbi,
Yisrael Meir Lau; Abdullah Salaih al-Obaid, secretary general of
the Muslim World League; and spiritual leaders representing
Buddhist, Hindu, Shinto, Jain, Sikh, Native American and
Zoroastrian faiths, among others.

PRESIDENT FORD APPARENTLY STRICKEN BY TWO STROKES &HT;    (EDS: Recasts lead)
 &HT;    By ERIC ROSENBERG
 &HT;    c.2000 Hearst Newspapers
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHILADELPHIA _ Physicians treating former President Gerald Ford
for two small strokes said Wednesday that they expect him to
``totally recover'' and be released from a local hospital in
approximately five days.
</P>
<P>
   Ford, 87, checked into Hahnemann Hospital Tuesday night and was
initially diagnosed as suffering a sinus disorder. He was given
antibiotics to take over the next several days and released.
</P>
<P>
   But Ford, who became president when Richard Nixon was forced to
resign in 1974, returned under his own power, briefcase in hand,
Wednesday morning as his condition worsened. Doctors confirmed
after additional tests that he had suffered the strokes.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Robert Schwartzman, the hospital's chief of neurology, said
that by Wednesday afternoon Ford still was dizzy and had slurred
speech and trouble swallowing. But the neurologist added that
``President Ford is improving. He is much better.''
</P>
<P>
   He said Ford, who will remain hospitalized for ``five days or
so,'' probably suffered one stroke on Monday and another on
Wednesday. Schwartzman said he expected Ford, who had been
attending the Republican National Convention across town, to
``totally recover.''
</P>
<P>
   Betty Ford, the former president's wife, was at his side and was
``very upset but fine,'' Schwartzman said at a news conference.
</P>
<P>
   Texas Gov. George W. Bush, who was nominated for president by
convention delegates Wednesday night, said in a statement that
``America loves Gerald and Betty Ford for their integrity, wisdom
and compassion.'' Bush also spoke to Mrs. Ford by phone as did
President Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   Vice President Al Gore said in a statement that he joins with
all Americans ``in holding President Ford and his family in our
thoughts and prayers.''
</P>
<P>
   The doctors defended their initial decision to send Ford home
Tuesday night, saying that his symptoms were identical to those of
an ear infection. Releasing Ford ``was appropriate for the symptoms
he had last night,'' said Dr. Stephen Klasko, another neurologist
at Hahnemann.
</P>
<P>
   The type of stroke Ford suffered, likely a cerebral thrombosis,
is not usually fatal but can sometimes result in temporary or
permanent physical ailments such as numbness in the limbs and
speech impairment or, in more severe cases, reduced cognitive
skills.
</P>
<P>
   Strokes occur when sections of the brain are deprived of oxygen,
which is needed to sustain cellular life. There are two broad
categories of strokes _ those caused by blockages in arteries in
the brain, which account for roughly 84 percent of all strokes in
the United States, and those caused by ruptured blood vessels in
the brain, which account for 16 percent.
</P>
<P>
   The latter is more deadly, usually killing half of people who
are stricken, according to Dr. Abdul Nassief, who is on the faculty
at Washington University's stroke center in St. Louis. It was this
type of stroke that killed Sen. Paul Coverdell, R-Ga., last month.
</P>
<P>
   Ford, however, was apparently stricken by the less serious
variety, which is often called a ``brain attack.'' Schwartzman said
it occurred near the base of his brain. Other experts said the
location offers the president a good prognosis because that region
does not govern a person's cognitive capabilities or the body's
most crucial organs.
</P>
<P>
   ``If a stroke happens at the base of the brain, a person has a
better outcome,'' said Nassief, adding that there is an 80 percent
chance of recovery in such cases. Still, a series of strokes to the
same region of the brain can lessen chances of a full recovery, he
said, leaving the victim with such physical ailments as numbness or
paralysis.
</P>
<P>
   Much like an arterial blockage near the heart that can lead to a
heart attack, this type of stroke occurs after arteries in the
brain have built up sediments that clog their passageways. When the
blood flow is reduced or restricted, the brain is then deprived of
oxygen, killing nerve cells. As the cells die, the part of the body
that they control also is affected.
</P>
<P>
   Schwartzman told reporters that said the former president has a
general hardening of the arteries that usually occurs with
advancing age.
</P>
<P>
   Ford, who is active in numerous health-related charities, last
year recorded a 30-second public service announcement for use on
Michigan television and radio to educate viewers and listeners
about the danger from strokes.
</P>
<P>
   According to the American Heart Association, strokes killed
159,791 people in 1997 and are the third largest cause of death in
the United States behind heart disease and cancer. Strokes are also
the leading cause of long-term disability in the United States.
</P>
<P>
   Some 600,000 people suffer a stroke each year. Women account for
61 percent of stroke fatalities. An estimated 4 million Americans
have survived stokes.

OVERLOOKED ROYALS PITCHER MAKES YANKEES TAKE NOTICE
</HEADLINE>
  By JACK CURRY   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ The first time Blake Stein visited Yankee Stadium two
years ago, he kept his jacket on while he sat nervously in the
bullpen because he did not want any raucous fans to see the name on
his Oakland Athletics uniform. Some of Stein's teammates warned him
that the fans would verbally harass him if they found out who he
was, so Stein kept his jacket buttoned and tried to remain
anonymous.
</P>
<P>
   Stein, who is now with the Kansas City Royals, was not anonymous
Wednesday, and everyone noticed the name on his uniform because he
frustrated the New York Yankees in meandering to a 4-1 victory.
</P>
<P>
   It was a listless day at Yankee Stadium. The sun finally poked
through and it was warm, dry and humid, weather suitable for
playing baseball or taking a nap. The Yankees did more of the
latter against Stein.
</P>
<P>
   While Stein stymied the Yankees on one run and two hits in eight
innings, some Yankees did not feel as if they had been dominated
because Stein walked six and allowed base runners in eight innings.
But Stein stopped the Yankees in a rare way, feeding them fastballs
as he fell behind in the count and then getting them to sock
harmless fly balls to the deepest parts of the Stadium in left
field and center field.
</P>
<P>
   ``It helps me realize I do have a place here,'' Stein said. ``I
can pitch in the big leagues. The Yankees are one of the best teams
in baseball for the last four or five years and one of the best
this year. To come in and pitch this way is a really good
feeling.''
</P>
<P>
   The Yankees looked sluggish when the Royals rapped Denny Neagle
for three runs in the second inning, and they never really
recovered. Neagle's first pitch of the game produced a broken-bat
single, and his second pitch resulted in a bunt single. After three
pitches, Neagle furiously rubbed a baseball and waved to the fans
in the right-field bleachers who chanted his name. He should have
waved for help because it got stickier after his 21-pitch first.
</P>
<P>
   Neagle told Roger Clemens that he hates having difficult innings
early in games because it drains him. Sure enough, four of the
first five Royals clubbed hits in the second inning, and three of
them scored. Neagle did not have a decent slider or fastball, and
he felt helpless while losing for the first time in his four starts
as a Yankee.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everyone has those days when they struggle,'' said Neagle, who
gave up three earned runs and 11 hits in seven innings. ``I felt
like it was going to be one of those days where I battled. I
battled and kept us in the game.''
</P>
<P>
   Not really. Because of Stein, the Yankees were barely in the
game. So Stein, who entered the game with a 7-13 record and a 5.89
earned run average in his career, topped Neagle, who had been 2-0
with a 2.25 ERA in three starts for the Yankees.
</P>
<P>
   ``You scratch your head, you wonder how that could happen, but
you watched it first hand,'' Yankees manager Joe Torre said. ``A
guy goes out there as big as Stein and he can have his way.''
</P>
<P>
   Stein turns 27 today, and the fans behind the dugout definitely
knew who Stein was this time.
</P>
<P>
   ``They were saying, `Good job, don't ever do it again,''' Stein
said. ``When someone walked in the ninth, they said they'd hate to
see me lose this one, but it would be all right. They were pretty
complimentary.''  &QL;

   NORTON, Zimbabwe _ The parliamentary elections are over, but in
the rustling fields, black squatters are still occupying a thousand
white-owned farms. And even the governing party acknowledges that
``criminal elements'' have been causing havoc on some farms.
</P>
<P>
   On Wednesday, the opposition alliance of black union members and
white business owners brought the nation to a standstill, as
thousands of black employees stayed home from work and white
industrialists shut banks and stores to protest the farm invasions.
</P>
<P>
   President Robert Mugabe, whose party won a narrow majority in
Parliament a month ago, buoyed by his promise to redistribute land,
has refused to remove the squatters, despite several court orders.
</P>
<P>
   But he seemed to bow to the pressure Wednesday. He said the
squatters would leave most farms in a month, as the government
completes its redistribution plan. ``We will, in the process, be
removing all war veterans from the rest of the farms that will not
be resettled,'' Mugabe said at a news conference. ``The time frame?
I cannot be that exact. But certainly I want to say within this
month.''
</P>
<P>
   But here, on a sprawling tobacco farm an hour from the capital,
there is no sign of change. Squatters armed with machetes disturb
the uneasy peace. And it seems increasingly clear that Mugabe is
willing to do whatever is necessary to remake the hated colonial
map that left the tiny white minority in control of more than half
the country's fertile land.
</P>
<P>
   This week, government officials stunned the white farmers' union
and foreign donors with an announcement that they would soon
redistribute more than 3,000 white-owned farms, half the white
commercial farmland, to 500,000 peasant families.
</P>
<P>
   ``You're living in a state of anarchy,'' said Bob Sherriffs, 33,
whose family farm here has been occupied by black squatters and
earmarked for acquisition. ``You're living in a state of fear. One
minute you feel it will all come right. The next minute you feel,
`Is there any hope for us?'''
</P>
<P>
   Officials close to Mugabe said he was focused on his legacy,
determined to go down in history as the liberation hero, as the man
who wrested the land from the whites, who make up less than 2
percent of the population, and returned it to the blacks. So this
time, the squatters on the farm here did not disappear after the
election. They came back in bare feet and fraying clothes,
determined to sleep at the foot of Sherriffs' family property until
they had their own piece of land.
</P>
<P>
   The adversaries, white and black, stood side by side, with
Sherriffs on one side and the squatters on the other, all smiling
their polite ``Good morning'' in the awkward detente that has
become an accepted daily ritual.
</P>
<P>
   Zarimba Zarimba, 24, a squatter who has been living on the farm
since April, said he believed that the battle would soon be over.
Soon, he said, the whites will return the land that was stolen from
his ancestors decades ago. Soon, he said, he will be tilling his
own potatoes, tobacco and corn. He hopes that the transfer will be
peaceful, he added, but he is ready to fight.
</P>
<P>
   ``The nation wants land,'' Zarimba said. ``We will not leave
until we are all satisfied.''
</P>
<P>
   The pointed outrage of the white farmers and the steely
determination of government officials often mask a complicated
reality. High-ranking officials at the white farmers' union are
well aware that the 3,000 farms represent 2 million acres of land,
the very acreage of underused land that the union and Western
donors have agreed should be given over to landless peasants.
</P>
<P>
   Although the farmers have serious concerns about whether the
farms were properly selected, Westerners say union officials have
repeatedly promised and failed to deliver their own list of
underused farms.
</P>
<P>
   Mugabe, on the other hand, likes to fault whites for the slow
pace of land reform while his government has lacked the will, the
capacity and the cash to make redistribution a reality. Over the
years, his promises of speedy redistribution were viewed as hollow
campaign pledges that ushered in the start of each election season
and faded out after the votes had been counted.
</P>
<P>
   But now, after 20 years in power, Mugabe, 76, seems to feel a
sense of urgency. He has watched his popularity plummet. In June,
his party lost its overwhelming dominance in Parliament for the
first time since 1980, when the nation voted in a new opposition
party, the Movement for Democratic Change.
</P>
<P>
   On Wednesday, he watched the capital become a ghost town as
ordinary citizens ignored the state-controlled media's call for
people to report to work.
</P>
<P>
   Mugabe has been taking several steps to respond to his critics.
This week, the government finally devalued the Zimbabwe dollar, a
move that was quickly applauded. Last month, Mugabe formed a
Cabinet that now includes several highly respected business
leaders.
</P>
<P>
   Also Wednesday, Mugabe gave President Thabo Mbeki of South
Africa assurances that the government would deal with the
lawlessness on the farms. ``It's a matter that we discussed,'' said
Mbeki, who was visiting Mugabe and said he believed that the issue
would be resolved.
</P>
<P>
   Mbeki has heard that promise before. In April, Mugabe told Mbeki
that he would bring an end to the violence on the farms. In fact,
the violence intensified and further alienated Western donors, who
are desperately needed to rescue the flailing economy.

BOEING FACING $1.2 MILLION FINE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By JAMES WALLACE  
 c.2000 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEATTLE _ The Federal Aviation Administration Wednesday proposed
a record $1.24 million in fines against The Boeing Co. for
inadequate supplier oversight and for failing to quickly report
cracked parts on two older jetliners.
</P>
<P>
   In one case, Boeing waited 415 days _ instead of the required 24
hours _ to report that an operator had found a crack in the aft
pressure bulkhead of an older 737, the FAA said.
</P>
<P>
   Cracks in that area, if they grow, can cause rapid decompression
of the flight deck and cabin.
</P>
<P>
   All the incidents occurred from two to three years ago, and the
proposed fines are unrelated to a recently completed special FAA
audit of Boeing's quality control and manufacturing processes.
</P>
<P>
   A Boeing spokeswoman said the company has taken steps to fix the
problems noted by the FAA, and is in informal talks with the
federal agency that could lead to a settlement.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are talking to them (the FAA) about closing this out,''
said Boeing's Liz Verdier. ``Whether they reduce their fine is up
to them.''
</P>
<P>
   Should the $1.24 million in fines stand _ and that is unlikely
based on past practices in such matters _ it would be the largest
in Boeing's history.
</P>
<P>
   The FAA's biggest previous proposed fine against Boeing was for
$392,000 last July. The FAA said then that Boeing failed to report
a manufacturing defect on its 757s within 24 hours as required.
Boeing waited more than a year to notify the agency, the FAA said.
</P>
<P>
   Verdier said Boeing and the FAA have not yet settled the 1999
case, and the proposed fine has not been paid.
</P>
<P>
   In the latest case, the FAA proposed separate penalties of
$500,000 and $714,000.
</P>
<P>
   The smaller of the proposed fines is for failing to report
cracks in critical airframe structures within 24 hours as required
by law.
</P>
<P>
   In August 1997, the FAA said, Boeing was notified by the
operator of a 737-100 that three cracks had been found in the
horizontal stabilizer (the wing-like structure on the tail.) The
cracks were 1.1 inches, 2.3 inches and 12 inches long, the FAA
said.
</P>
<P>
   The stabilizer is a critical flight control surface and the
cracks could have, in the worst case, resulted in a ``reduced
structural capability'' of the stabilizer, the FAA said.
</P>
<P>
   The 737-100 is the oldest of the Boeing's 737 models and was
built in the late 1960s. There are only a few still flying today.
</P>
<P>
   Boeing did not notify the FAA of the cracks until July 1998,
some 298 days after first learning about them, the FAA said.
</P>
<P>
   The FAA also said that in September 1997, Boeing was notified by
the operator of a 737-200 (a 1970's model) that a 3.5-inch fatigue
crack was found in the aft pressure bulkhead. Boeing waited until
late November 1998 to notify the FAA.
</P>
<P>
   In both cases, Verdier said, Boeing delayed making reports to
the FAA because it had to wait to obtain the parts in question from
the 737 operators so they could be tested.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our procedure is to make a report within 24 hours of
determination of a potential problem,'' she said. ``We could not
make such a determination until we got the parts ... It took
months.''
</P>
<P>
   She said Boeing has improved its reporting methods in response
to the FAA's findings.
</P>
<P>
   ``We average about 100,000 messages a year from our operators,''
she said. ``We try and make a determination so that the
safety-related ones get passed to the FAA. That process has been
tightened and improved.''
</P>
<P>
   The FAA noted Boeing's efforts.
</P>
<P>
   ``Since the time of the alleged events, Boeing has cooperated
with the FAA in developing an improved reporting process that
exceeds the requirements of the regulation,'' the agency said in a
statement.
</P>
<P>
   The FAA's proposed $741,000 penalty is related to Boeing's
oversight of its suppliers and subcontractors. Boeing failed to
assure they adopted and adhered to the company's quality control
policies and procedures, the FAA said. The supplier actions
occurred more than two years ago, the FAA said, and did not
directly effect aircraft safety.
</P>
<P>
   In four separate cases, the FAA said, suppliers did not follow
Boeing's quality control practices.
</P>
<P>
   ``Failing to do so might have resulted in Boeing's use of
nonconforming materials to build airplanes,'' the FAA said.
</P>
<P>
   The violations came to light during FAA inspections of Boeing's
suppliers in late 1997 and early 1998.
</P>
<P>
   The contractors and suppliers are: Parker Control Systems of
Ogden, Utah; Aerospace Technologies of Port Melbourne, Australia;
Northrup Grumman's Grand Prarie, Texas, plant; and Kayaba
Industries of Tokyo, Japan.
</P>
<P>
   They were cited for a total of 17 different violations,
including improperly heat-treating products, failing to
periodically check tooling machines, failure to keep up with
certification for quality-control workers, and failing to make
corrections identified in past audits.
</P>
<P>
   Boeing said no substandard parts ever made it onto aircraft from
the contractors in question.
</P>
<P>
   ``Most of the violations were training and procedural issues,''
Verdier said.
</P>
<P>
   She said Boeing continues to work with its suppliers to improve
practices and to make sure the company's quality control procedures
are followed.
</P>
<P>
   Boeing has more than 3,500 worldwide suppliers.
</P>
<P>
   The FAA and Boeing also continue to talk about the findings of
the special audit that was started last December.
</P>
<P>
   The audit also found lax supplier oversight by Boeing.
</P>
<P>
   It was sparked by a series of embarrassing production and
quality control problems that resulted in defective parts being
installed on Boeing airplanes.
</P>
<P>
   Boeing and the FAA are currently developing an action plan to
address problems discovered during the audit. The findings won't be
made public until the action plan has been approved by the FAA.
</P>
<P>
   An FAA spokeswoman said Wednesday the proposed plan is under
review at the agency's headquarters in Washington, D.C.
</P>
<P>
   Since the audit, Boeing has increased scrutiny of its suppliers
and added more people to a unit that works with suppliers and
monitors the quality of parts.

<P>
   PHILADELPHIA _ Former President Gerald R. Ford was admitted to
the neurological intensive care unit of Hahnemann University
Hospital here Wednesday after suffering what doctors said was at
least one small stroke over the last three days.
</P>
<P>
   After a day of tests, he was listed in ``serious and improving''
condition, with the prognosis good for full recovery.
</P>
<P>
   ``The president should totally recover,'' Dr. Robert J.
Schwartzman, the hospital's chief neurologist, said in a briefing
late Wednesday afternoon.
</P>
<P>
   Ford, who is 87 and served as the nation's 38th president, was
in Philadelphia for the Republican National Convention. Only hours
before being admitted to the hospital, near the city's center, he
had been given a rousing salute by convention delegates for his
brief, generally calming and healing stewardship of the nation in
the embarrassing aftermath of Watergate.
</P>
<P>
   Ford arrived at the hospital at about 9 a.m. Wednesday,
complaining of dizziness, weakness in his left arm and an inability
to speak without slurring his words. He was admitted, hospital
officials later said, after an imaging scan indicated he had
suffered at least one stroke in the brain stem in the rear of his
head.
</P>
<P>
   It was Ford's second visit to the hospital in less than 10
hours, his first having occurred around midnight when, accompanied
by his usual Secret Service security detail, he walked in on his
own complaining of sinus pain. He was given some pain medicine and
released.
</P>
<P>
   Hospital officials defended their decision to release him
without further tests, saying they felt that they had sufficiently
responded to the symptoms they saw.
</P>
<P>
   ``All he sought was some pain relief,'' Dr. Wayne Satz, the
hospital's chief of emergency medicine, said.
</P>
<P>
   Asked what was different about the symptoms that led to a sinus
infection diagnosis first and later a diagnosis of a stroke, Satz
said the symptoms were more acute in the second hospital visit and
that Ford's wife, Betty, had reported that Ford had also felt ill
earlier in the week.
</P>
<P>
   On Monday, before heading for Philadelphia, Mrs. Ford told
doctors, Ford saw a doctor in Colorado, complaining then, as later,
of head pain.
</P>
<P>
   In the convention hall on Tuesday night, while Ford was being
honored, he appeared visibly tired and in one interview noticeably
slurred his words.
</P>
<P>
   News that he had been hospitalized injected a somber note into a
convention that up to then had been one big joyful celebration of
George W. Bush.
</P>
<P>
   Hahnemann doctors said they were treating Ford with
blood-thinners in an effort to diminish the likelihood of future
strokes. In someone his age, they emphasized, there was a greater
danger of another stroke than in someone younger.
</P>
<P>
   But a minor stroke is not unusual at that age.
</P>
<P>
   Schwartzman said Ford was ``perfectly awake, functioning
mentally _ that's not a problem.''
</P>
<P>
   A spokesman for the former president, Calvin McDowell, said Ford
was ``very alert and ready to go home.'' Should he continue to
recover without any complications, hospitals officials said, he
might be released in five or six days.
</P>
<P>
   ``He is able to take calls,'' McDowell said, ``but we are trying
to insist that he get some rest.''
</P>
<P>
   Schwartzman said he did not think Ford had suffered any brain
damage from the stroke.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think this will all clear, mainly in his balance center,''
he added. ``That should all recover.''
</P>
<P>
   Thomas Brott of the National Stroke Association, said it was
possible that the signs and symptoms Ford spoke about in his visit
to the hospital Tuesday night, when he complained of pain in his
face, dizziness and sleeplessness, would not have immediately
suggested to doctors that a stroke had occurred. Symptoms described
by a patient, Brott said, are often ambiguous and might point to a
cause more likely than a stroke, like an infection.
</P>
<P>
   On the same point, Schwartzman said that a mild stroke ``looks
like an inner ear infection sometimes, sometimes it's hard to tell
the difference.''
</P>
<P>
   A stroke is usually caused by a blood clot blocking a vessel in
the brain, so that cells beyond the blockage do not receive
nutrients, and can thus be injured or die.
</P>
<P>
   The cells affected in Ford's case are in the lower back of the
brain where motor activity, like balance, is controlled.
</P>
<P>
   In many cases, when the stroke is small, the damaged brain cells
can recover or the killed cells can be bypassed so that other
healthy cells can perform the same function, leading to complete
recovery.

<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Gerald R. Ford, an unelected president of the
United States who restored stability and honor to the White House
amid Watergate scandals, died (PUT DAY AND LOCATION HERE) at the
age of (PUT AGE HERE).
</P>
<P>
   Ford became America's 38th president during the depths of the
Watergate affair, taking office upon the resignation of President
Richard Nixon. He lost the presidency in a close election two years
later to Jimmy Carter, then the former governor of Georgia.
</P>
<P>
   Ford automatically became president at around 11:30 a.m. on Aug.
9, 1974, the moment Nixon's resignation letter reached Secretary of
State Henry Kissinger.
</P>
<P>
   Minutes later, Ford was sworn in by then-Chief Justice Warren E.
Burger and, in a televised speech from the White House East Room,
made the statement the country longed to hear and the one for which
he would always be remembered:
</P>
<P>
   ``My fellow Americans, our long national nightmare is over. Our
constitution works. Our great Republic is a government of laws and
not of men. Here the people rule . . .''
</P>
<P>
   And before a month was out, he took his most controversial
action as president, granting Nixon a ``full, free and absolute
pardon. . . .for all offenses against the United States which he. .
. .has committed or may have committed'' during his years as
president.
</P>
<P>
   The pardon, which Ford knew would stir deep anger among many
Americans and partisan criticism in Congress, was in many ways
typical of a quiet, dogged politician known for plowing ahead even
when he knew his actions would be unpopular.
</P>
<P>
   Years after leaving office, Ford, an avidly partisan Republican,
would declare that the president he admired most was an equally
partisan Democrat, Harry Truman. And the two would share a
reputation _ as men who navigated through public life on the basis
of directions from internal moral compasses, rather than according
to opinion polls or a perception of political climate.
</P>
<P>
   Born Leslie Lynch King Jr., son of Leslie and Dorothy Layer
Gardner King, on July 14, 1913, in Omaha, Neb., Ford grew up in
Michigan. His parents separated two weeks after his birth and his
mother took him to Grand Rapids to live with her parents.
</P>
<P>
   On Feb. 1, 1916, Dorothy King married Gerald R. Ford, a Grand
Rapids paint salesman, and they began calling her son Gerald R.
Ford Jr., although his name was not legally changed until Dec. 3,
1935. He was 14 years old before he knew that Gerald R. Ford was
not his biological father.
</P>
<P>
   He attended the University of Michigan and was a star lineman on
the university's national championship football teams in 1932 and
1933. In 1934, he was named the team's most valuable player.
</P>
<P>
   In a column he wrote a year ago for The New York Times _ in
which he went against the mainstream of his party and spoke out for
affirmative action _ Ford recalled a game between his Michigan
Wolverines and the Georgia Tech Yellow Jackets in which the Atlanta
school ``reputedly'' wanted the Michigan team's only black player
dropped from the roster.
</P>
<P>
   Members of the Michigan team were adamant that their black
teammate take the field, Ford wrote, but in the end, he chose not
to play.
</P>
<P>
   ``His sacrifice led me to question how educational
administrators could capitulate to raw prejudice,'' Ford wrote.
</P>
<P>
   After receiving his B.A. degree in political science and
economics at Michigan, he turned down pro football offers from the
Detroit Lions and the Green Bay Packers to enter the Yale Law
School, serving as an assistant football and boxing coach.
</P>
<P>
   Two future U.S. senators, William Proxmire of Wisconsin and
Robert Taft Jr. of Ohio, played on Yale football teams he helped
coach.
</P>
<P>
   After graduating from law school, Ford joined the Navy and
served during most of the major campaigns in the South Pacific.
</P>
<P>
   His biography on the Gerald Ford Library Web site notes that his
``closest call with death came not as a result of enemy fire,
however, but during a vicious typhoon in the Philippine Sea in
December 1944. He came within inches of being swept overboard.''
</P>
<P>
   Discharged as a lieutenant commander in 1946, Ford returned to
Grand Rapids. In 1948, he decided to challenge the incumbent
Republican for Congress and won by a large margin.
</P>
<P>
   The House of Representatives would be his political home for the
next 25 years. He served on the Public Works and Appropriations
committees and became House minority leader in 1965, unseating Rep.
Charles Halleck of Indiana.
</P>
<P>
   His reputation as a social conservative grew as he led
Republican opposition to many of the liberal programs of
then-President Lyndon B. Johnson between 1965 and 1969.
</P>
<P>
   Irked at Ford, Johnson was quoted as saying the House minority
leader had played in too many football games ``without his
helmet.''
</P>
<P>
   But Johnson also showed his regard for Ford by appointing him to
the Warren Commission, which investigated the assassination of the
late President John F. Kennedy. Ford became the last surviving
member of the commission, which was headed by then Chief Justice
Earl Warren.
</P>
<P>
   Ford supported Nixon in the 1968 and 1972 elections but never
realized his goal of becoming speaker of the House, where
Republicans failed to gain a majority during his service there.
</P>
<P>
   On Oct. 12, 1973, following the resignation of Vice President
Spiro Agnew, who pleaded no contest to tax evasion charges, Nixon
announced that he would nominate Ford for vice president. It was
the first time the Constitution's 25th Amendment, providing for
filling an empty vice president's office, was invoked.
</P>
<P>
   Democrats were not unanimously supportive, with many calling
Ford a man of mediocre ability and limited vision, but he was
overwhelmingly confirmed by both the House and Senate.
</P>
<P>
   Proxmire observed that although he thought the new vice
president had been wrong on almost every issue, ``he is a man that
the country may be looking for. He has the kind of wholesome
sincerity, the kind of loyal consistency that many voters may be
looking for. . . .''
</P>
<P>
   Only slightly over a year later, after succeeding Nixon, Ford
would nominate Nelson A. Rockefeller, one of America's richest men,
to succeed himself as vice president. For the first time in its
history, the country had both a president and a vice president
chosen under the 25th Amendment, rather than a national election.
</P>
<P>
   Ford survived two assassination attempts as president. Both
times, the assailants were women _ Lynette ``Squeaky'' Fromme and
Sara Jane Moore.
</P>
<P>
   Arguably the most athletic president in history, he acquired the
image of a stumbling klutz, thanks in part to a new television
show, ``Saturday Night Live,'' on which comedian Chevy Chase poked
fun, week-after-week, at the president because of a pair of events
that might otherwise have faded from notice: Ford's stumbling on
the steps of Air Force One and an errant golf shot that hit a
spectator on the head.
</P>
<P>
   When the two met at an event, Chase observed, ``You're a very
funny president.''
</P>
<P>
   ``You're a very funny suburb,'' Ford snapped back, referring to
the Washington suburb, Chevy Chase, Md.
</P>
<P>
   But the klutz image and the Nixon pardon were part of heavy
political baggage Ford took into the 1976 election, and with Sen.
Robert Dole of Kansas as his running mate, he lost one of the
closest presidential races in U.S. history to Carter.
</P>
<P>
   In the opening line of his inaugural address, Carter recognized
Gerald Ford's legacy: ``For myself and for our nation, I want to
thank my predecessor for all he has done to heal our land.'' Seated
behind him, Ford wept quietly.
</P>
<P>
   After leaving office Gerald Ford continued to speak out on
public affairs, lecturing in over 170 colleges and writing numerous
opinion pieces for newspapers and magazines. His autobiography, ``A
Time to Heal,'' was published in 1979.
</P>
<P>
   The Gerald R. Ford Foundation sponsors a pair of national
journalism awards, one for stories reporting on the presidency and
the other for stories about national defense issues. Winners in
2000 were Carl Cannon of the National Journal for stories about the
presidency and Russell Carollo of the Dayton Daily News for writing
about defense issues.

MORE SETBACKS FOR ISRAEL'S BARAK AS FOREIGN MINISTER RESIGNS 
</HEADLINE>
  (EDS: This version subs for the earlier story by Christopher S.
Wren) 
 By JOHN KIFNER   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   JERUSALEM _ Prime Minister Ehud Barak took another battering
Wednesday in the wake of the Camp David summit meeting when his
foreign minister resigned over Barak's willingness to compromise
with the Palestinians on Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
   The prime minister also faced four separate bills in the
Knesset, or parliament, calling for new elections that passed by
the same number of votes that would be needed to topple his
government in a no-confidence vote. The bills had no immediate
impact, but they served to further embolden the opposition.
</P>
<P>
   The resignation of Foreign Minister David Levy was not
unexpected. He had threatened to quit Wednesday if Barak did not
bring the right into a national unity government. And Levy, who is
known for his keen sense of which way the prevailing political
winds are blowing, had switched sides before when he resigned as
foreign minister from the cabinet of Barak's predecessor, Benjamin
Netanyahu.
</P>
<P>
   Barak, once a commando used to operating alone in enemy
territory, appeared unfazed, even cocky in the face of his latest
challenges, moving with a bouncy step and tight smile through the
tumult in the parliament. At one point, he sat next to Levy _ who
had just resigned with a fiery speech _ clapped him on the back and
shook his hand.
</P>
<P>
   With the parliament now in recess for its three-month vacation,
Barak and his dwindling supporters hope to reach some kind of an
agreement with the Palestinians, and possibly then go to new
elections on the prime minister's own terms, with the elections
serving as a kind of referendum on the peace effort.
</P>
<P>
   ``In a few more weeks the dust will settle,'' Barak said. ``We
may have three months to try and consolidate either the peace
negotiations or the government, and this may be the 90 days of the
most important period in the present Israeli agenda.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We will be able to broaden the base of the government and
continue into the future to achieve our objective,'' said Barak,
with apparent confidence.
</P>
<P>
   Yossi Sarid, a longtime peace advocate and chairman of the
10-seat Meretz party, which has supported Barak's government,
added: ``We have to gain time now, that is the recipe. We have to
gain a few months in order to gain something much more important,
because time won't do its part if we don't do ours. The time will
allow the achievement of an agreement with the Palestinians, and
this is possible.''
</P>
<P>
   But Limor Livnat, a stalwart of the right-wing Likud, shouted
scornfully, ``Don't try to pull any fast ones while the Knesset is
on recess.''
</P>
<P>
   The leader of the conservative Likud party, Ariel Sharon, warned
on Tuesday that what he called his ``Jerusalem Coalition'' would
``stand on guard,'' ready to call parliament back into session if
any agreement threatening Israeli sovereignty over all of Jerusalem
appeared likely.
</P>
<P>
   Before his resignation Wednesday, there had been signs that Levy
was seeking to return to his old home in Likud. During the Camp
David meeting, while he was acting prime minister in Barak's
absence, Levy made a sympathetic visit to hunger-striking settlers
outside the prime minister's residence.
</P>
<P>
   Wednesday, Levy spoke of the ``grave situation'' that had
developed because of the introduction of the once-taboo subject of
Jerusalem at Camp David.
</P>
<P>
   ``These things touch upon the soul of the people,'' he said.
``It turns out that we are talking about the very heart of ancient
Jerusalem. We are talking about things that the vast majority of
the people are connected in their soul, their past, present and
future.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I can say that the fact of an announcement that we would get
access to the Western Wall takes us backward to the time before the
establishment of the Jewish state,'' Levy added. ``Regarding the
Temple Mount, the Holy of Holies, they refused to understand the
connection of the Jewish people to the Holy of Holies. That is a
denial of our past in this land.''
</P>
<P>
   In all, five bills were introduced Wednesday calling for
dissolution of the parliament and new elections. But because they
will be referred to a committee controlled by Barak, the measures
can be bottled up and produce no immediate effect.
</P>
<P>
   The first bill, introduced by Likud's Silvan Shalom _ who said,
``the `prime minister of the people' has become the prime minister
of one man _ Ehud Barak'' _ received 61 votes in favor, 51 opposed
and six abstentions. Three similar bills each received the same
totals, and as some members drifted away, a final bill received 60
in favor, 47 opposed and six abstentions.
</P>
<P>
   Barak reportedly criticized his colleagues in the One Israel
party during a meeting Wednesday afternoon for not putting up a
decent fight, saying they were coming across as whining and
defeatist. Their problems did not reflect a state of total
collapse, he said, adding the faint-hearted should step aside.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, parliament Speaker Avraham Burg _ a potential
rival _ warned Barak that he was keeping too many decisions to
himself and would stand alone if he did not take other Labor Party
leaders into his confidence.
</P>
<P>
   In the immediate speculation over who would be named foreign
minister, the public security minister, Shlomo Ben-Ami, figured
prominently because the dovish history professor has been a senior
negotiator in the peace talks and meets frequently with Palestinian
security officials. There was also talk of Sarid, the Meretz party
chairman, but he is said to want to regain the Education Ministry
post he resigned in the vain hope of keeping the Shas Party, with
its crucial 17 seats, in Barak's coalition. Shas quit the
government on the eve of the Camp David meeting.
</P>
<P>
   The problems Barak has had in contending with recently changed
election procedures, which have resulted in a fragmented parliament
of small parties that pursue their own interests, were on full
display again Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   The five ultra-orthodox members from the United Torah Judaism
party were clumped in the back of the chamber not taking part in
the vote, saying they were under orders from their spiritual
leader, Rabbi Shalom Yosef Elyashiv, to abstain.
</P>
<P>
   Shouting Likud members descended on them and threatened that if
they did abstain, Likud would vote against a bill they have
sponsored granting additional government benefits to large
families. The five votes were duly cast against Barak.
</P>
<P>
   The parliamentary sessions have become so emotional that Burg,
in his summing up of the summer session, expressed concern that the
tension might lead to fisticuffs on the floor.
</P>
<P>
   ``If there is a prayer in my heart, it is that I won't be the
first Knesset speaker in whose term of office there was violence in
the Knesset,'' he said.

U.S. INVESTIGATES FATAL SUV CRASHES LINKED TO DISINTEGRATING
TIRES 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Fla.)   c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ A federal agency said Wednesday that it was
investigating 21 deaths in crashes of sport utility vehicles that
may have occurred because the tires disintegrated.
</P>
<P>
   The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration has received
193 complaints about accidents, including those that caused the 21
deaths, that took place when the tread on ATX, ATX II and
Wilderness tires made by Bridgestone/Firestone Co. separated. These
tires are found on sport utility vehicles and trucks.
</P>
<P>
   Complaints about these tires have trickled into the agency for
the last 10 years, but media attention given to accidents involving
ATX tires in Florida caused a jump in the number of accidents
reported, Elizabeth C. Neblett, a spokeswoman for the agency, said.
</P>
<P>
   The agency is working with Bridgestone/Firestone to analyze
complaints about the tires. Ford Motor Co. is also involved in the
agency's investigation because ATX and Wilderness tires on Ford
Explorers account for many of the accidents reported.
</P>
<P>
   On July 21, two families in Jacksonsville, Fla., filed separate
suits against Bridgestone/Firestone and Ford Motor contending that
tread on Firestone tires on Ford Explorers separated and caused the
death of two passengers.
</P>
<P>
   Similar suits concerning the tires have been filed since 1996.
</P>
<P>
   Both Firestone and Ford declined to comment about the lawsuits.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the accidents involving the tires occurred in warmer
areas of the country, according to documents on file at the NHTSA.
The majority of these were high-speed blowouts.
</P>
<P>
   The tire can disintegrate when the car is going over 60 miles an
hour according to Harry R. Baumgardner, the president of Tire
Consultants Inc. in Alpharetta Ga., a former supervisor of the
retreading of tires on Bridgestone/Firestone production lines, who
is now a consultant. ``The physical properties of the rubber is
inadequate to handle the stresses which are involved with the tire
running on the road, specifically when it's running in hotter
areas,'' said Baumgardner, who has testified in lawsuits about tire
safety.
</P>
<P>
   Bridgestone/Firestone denied the charges and said it is offering
free tire inspections. ``These are safe tires.'' said Christine
Karbowiak, a Bridgestone/Firestone spokeswoman. But the company is
encouraging owners to have their tires inspected at company-owned
Firestone Tire and Service Centers.
</P>
<P>
   The tires have been original equipment on Ford, General Motors,
Toyota, Nissan and Subaru vehicles for several years.
</P>
<P>
   Ford is conducting an independent investigation of Firestone
tires on its sport utility vehicles.

   Colin Powell made sense. Everyone likes the idea of Colin Powell
_ perhaps because almost no one knows where he stands on any
substantive political issue. But Condoleezza Rice? Can you honestly
say you knew who she was before Tuesday?
</P>
<P>
   I wonder, though, when the Republicans will get beyond trotting
people out and turn to doing something that might be meaningful for
people of color. For now, as only Rev. Jesse Jackson would put it,
``You got Colin Powell making speeches, but you got Trent Lott
making policy.''
</P>
<P>
   Powell, whose public political pronouncements have been mostly
confined to his brave support for volunteerism, finally embraced
the role so many have longed for him to play: front man, for a
party that has had few prominent black faces up front.
</P>
<P>
   Rice, Bush's chief foreign policy adviser, followed Powell on
Tuesday night by assuring us that her candidate is a tough guy who
will stand tall against our enemies, never mind all that talk about
his lack of ``gravitas.''
</P>
<P>
   National political conventions long ago mutated into television
shows, then pep rallies, a moment to put forth the best possible
face of a candidate. For the Republicans, still smarting from the
lessons of eight years ago, that means convincing America that they
aren't the party that hates women, minorities, and gays. Bully for
them.
</P>
<P>
   Between Reconstruction and the Depression, many blacks regularly
voted Republican, largely out of loyalty to the president who freed
the slaves. FDR changed that, and the civil rights movement that
followed made the exodus permanent. Despite all the social changes
of the past two generations, nothing has ever shaken the allegiance
of most of black America to the Democrats.
</P>
<P>
   In fairness, Bush has spent a considerable part of his down time
since he vanquished John McCain attempting to prove that
``compasssionate conservatism'' has something to say to those who
have long had no use for his party.
</P>
<P>
   He has offered to overhaul the Immigration and Naturalization
Service, to make it more compassionate to immigrants. He has touted
the improved test scores of black students in Texas. His campaign
has made sure we know he got 27 percent of the black vote when he
won election to his second term as governor in 1998.
</P>
<P>
   Still, W. has a tough row to hoe. Both his father, in 1992, and
Bob Dole, in 1996, barely broke into double digits among black
voters. Given the enormous popularity of the Clinton presidency
among blacks _ a popularity I'm not sure Clinton's policies fully
deserve _ George W. Bush doesn't figure to do much better than the
first George Bush. Bill Bradley thought he could make a run at the
black vote running against Al Gore in the primaries, and he has
been on vacation for months.
</P>
<P>
   Black America has a strange relationship with both parties, but
especially the GOP. Even black Republican candidates, such as they
are, win only sporadic support from black voters. That isn't an
accident, and no roster of speakers will be enough to change it.
</P>
<P>
   But the token gestures just keep on coming. If not for a traffic
accident and a few other mishaps, Massachusetts Republicans would
be patting themselves on the back right now for recruiting Jack E.
Robinson as a Senate candidate, even though under the best of
circumstances he would have absolutely no shot at toppling Edward
M. Kennedy.
</P>
<P>
   I wonder what the minority voters who are meant to be swayed by
the images flickering on their TV screens will find in the
Republican platform to bolster a belief in George W. Bush. I wonder
if he believes his revolving-door death penalty policy is just the
thing to make me feel safer and more secure. I wish he would talk
in something other than platitudes about how he would pick his
Supreme Court nominees. And as long as he and his supporters are so
comfortable invoking legacy, I can't help remembering that part of
his father's legacy is Clarence Thomas.
</P>
<P>
   The Republicans seem to be having themselves a fine party, and
I'm glad to see some blacks on the guest list. But I have some
questions about what happens when the party's over.

TEXANS, `LOUD AND PROUD,' PUTTING ON A GLITZY SHOW IN PHILLY
</HEADLINE>
  (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
 By BUD KENNEDY 
 c.2000 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHILADELPHIA _ In a late-breaking news bulletin from the
Republican National Convention, the three major networks have
learned that Texans can look really stupid.
</P>
<P>
   Texans can look stupid waving their cowboy hats and howling like
drunken cowboys at a wet T-shirt contest. Texans can look stupid
praying, as a few did Tuesday night in a petty protest against a
gay congressman giving a speech about free trade. Texans can even
look stupid when sitting still, particularly if adorned with Lone
Star flag sequined jackets and enough rhinestones to temporarily
blind Brit Hume.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. Sen. John McCain even asked the Texas delegates to sit down
and stop waving their hats during his speech Tuesday night.
Supposedly, he couldn't see the TelePrompTer.
</P>
<P>
   If only he could have calmed them down to start the week.
</P>
<P>
   And those get-ups. I'm not sure who is the worst-dressed here _
the Texas delegates or the street protesters.
</P>
<P>
   Bill Eastland, an Arlington alternate and the city's favorite
anti-tax crank, only grinned about the Texans' hokey show.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're loud and we're proud,'' he said. ``Hokey? We're Texans.
We LIKE hokey.''
</P>
<P>
   Speaking of hokey: At the time, he was standing in an old Army
National Guard mounted cavalry horse barn, at a party featuring
barbecued brisket, pork ribs and plenty of Shiner Bock. On stage,
Jerry Jeff Walker had just finished singing ``London Homesick
Blues'' and was going into ``Up Against the Wall Redneck Mother.''
</P>
<P>
   It may or may not console you to know that this party for Ennis
Congressman Joe Barton and 1,400 invited guests was thrown by
America's gas utility companies.
</P>
<P>
   It's not even the largest Texas barbecue this week.
</P>
<P>
   At a convention where the star is Texas Gov. George W. Bush, the
only serious conflict of the week may be at the buffet tables. Call
it the Battle of the Barbecue.
</P>
<P>
   For Wednesday's smoker showdown, Barton chose fellow Aggie and
Texas House candidate Charlie Geren of Fort Worth, who weighed in
with 450 pounds of beef brisket, 120 pounds of chicken and 120
pounds of sausage from his Railhead Smokehouse restaurant.
</P>
<P>
   ``Barton tried my barbecue at a party once, and he liked it,''
Geren said, hustling to keep the meat warm with Sterno pots because
there was no place to connect a power generator in the 1916-vintage
Pennsylvania State Armory cavalry barn.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hope I can keep these Yankees from puttin' sauce on it.''
</P>
<P>
   Geren is not the only North Texas pitmaster in town. Dallas
barbecue caterer Eddie Deen, partner in the Ranch Hand BBQ
restaurant in Terrell, was firing up his pit Wednesday to feed the
national press corps traveling with Bush. Deen, a cousin to the
Deen Meat Co. family in Fort Worth and former Mayor Edgar Deen,
catered beef for 15,000 at both Bush inaugurations in Austin. A
local newspaper called him ``W's man for BBQ.''
</P>
<P>
   Deen studied molecular biology at A&AMP;M. ``I've spent a lot of
time figuring out how different smokers and different heat
temperatures affect the protein molecule,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Up here, though, what's important is to put on a good Texas
show.''
</P>
<P>
   The final cowboy throwdown will be Thursday night after the
convention, when House Majority Leader Dick Armey of Ennis throws a
party starring Brooks &AMP; Dunn and serving Capital Q barbecue from
Washington _ with help from Bush's new hometown hangout, the
Citrano Bros. Coffee Shop Cafe in McGregor near the Bush spread in
Crawford.
</P>
<P>
   Sammy Citrano was headed to town Wednesday. He's bringing a
smoker and barbecue fixin's for 4,000.
</P>
<P>
   He'll cook with hickory wood. If it runs low, he can stoke the
fire with all those hats.

NEWS ANALYSIS: EVEN BY CONVENTION STANDARDS, GOP SHORT ON
SPECIFICS 
</HEADLINE>
   By R.W. APPLE Jr.   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHILADELPHIA _ It is all so murky, the rhetoric here, that you
might think yourself back in the presidential campaign of 1952,
when Dwight D. Eisenhower promised, ``I shall go to Korea,'' but
supplied no details about what he would do to end the war once he
got there.
</P>
<P>
   Or maybe 1968 or 1972, in the heyday of Richard Nixon, another
campaigner often short on specifics. Confident that he was well
ahead of Hubert Humphrey in 1968, he told the nation he would end
the war in Vietnam, but he never bothered to say what he had in
mind. Four years later, more confident, he stayed off the stump,
running the first Rose Garden campaign.
</P>
<P>
   This year, en route to the nomination for president, Gov. George
W. Bush of Texas has hammered the Clinton administration's foreign
policy, suggesting that it has been inept, ill-focused and lacking
in clear priorities.
</P>
<P>
   In a speech in Washington on May 23, he said ``the world has
changed faster than United States policy'' and called for a fresh
approach to nuclear weapons and a more comprehensive missile
defense system. At other times he has hinted he would spend less
energy on humanitarian missions and more on dealing with great
powers like China and Russia and with America's allies.
</P>
<P>
   But the first three nights of a Republican convention that Bush
had promised would lay new ideas before the American people,
including a night designated as an occasion to discuss national
security, produced few details of what a Bush administration might
do overseas. The speeches have been vague even by the lax standards
of convention oratory, an art form that was tailor-made for
bloviation.
</P>
<P>
   Most of what has been said dealt with Bush's personal qualities,
not with policy _ grist for People magazine, not Foreign Affairs.
</P>
<P>
   ``No specifics, no nuance,'' said the historian Michael
Beschloss. ``I think the lack of content may be unprecedented. They
argue that Bill Clinton paid less attention to foreign policy than
any president since Herbert Hoover, which may be fair. But they
have given no example here of how they would lead or where they
would go.''
</P>
<P>
   It may be that Bush himself will fill in the gaps when he
appears before the convention on Thursday night. But if so, he will
change the pattern that has emerged this week.
</P>
<P>
   On Monday, Colin Powell, chairman of the joint chiefs of staff
during the war in the Persian Gulf, talked almost exclusively about
domestic affairs, including the ills afflicting urban areas, the
need to pay more attention to the education of the nation's
children and the problems of minorities. Only at the end did he
look overseas, assuring the delegates that Bush ``will not repeat
the mistakes of the past and let our insurance policy, our armed
forces, fall into disrepair.''
</P>
<P>
   Tuesday's speeches consisted mostly of similar generalizations.
</P>
<P>
   Norman Schwarzkopf, who commanded American troops in the Middle
East in the war, said that American military strength had withered
since then. But he gave no prescription for rebuilding it, except
to voice a wish for ``another commander in chief named George Bush
with Dick Cheney on his team.'' Cheney, nominated Wednesday night
as Bush's running mate, served as defense secretary during the war.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. John McCain of Arizona, whom Bush defeated for the
nomination, said that Bush ``knows well that there is no safe
alternative to American leadership, and he will not squander this
unique moment in history by allowing America to retreat behind
empty threats, false promises and uncertain diplomacy'' _ an
indirect indictment of Clinton, presumably, but one unaccompanied
by even shadowy proposals for policy initiatives.
</P>
<P>
   Bush's main foreign-policy adviser, Condoleezza Rice, was only
slightly more forthcoming. She said that Bush would not regard the
American military as ``a global police force,'' without a clue as
to where and under what circumstances troops should be used; she
promised that Bush would move at the earliest possible date to
institute ``the deployment of effective missile defenses,'' without
saying when that might be, and asserted that Bush ``recognizes the
challenge the Chinese government poses to our interests and
values,'' without outlining how that challenge might be met.
</P>
<P>
   Much of what she said sounded like cheerleading, as when she
praised Bush _ ``the George W. Bush that I know'' _ as a man of
``uncommonly good judgment'' who is ``focused and consistent'' and
knows ``that we Americans are at our best when we exercise power
without fanfare and arrogance.''
</P>
<P>
   Wednesday night, Cheney joined in the chorus, praising Bush in
his advance text as ``a man who has the courage and the vision and
the goodness to be a great president.'' Big changes, he said, are
coming to Washington, after eight years of ``squandered
opportunities.'' He did not name them.
</P>
<P>
   Aside from promising, like almost everyone, to devote more
resources to the armed forces, Cheney also concentrated on life at
home. He talked about education and Social Security and working
together with Democrats to end the air ``of bitterness and ill will
and partisan strife'' in Washington, but not about Europe or Asia.
</P>
<P>
   Like Clinton eight years ago, Bush began the campaign with an
inconvenient dearth of foreign policy experience. Like Clinton, and
unlike Vice President Al Gore, his Democratic rival, he has no
service in Vietnam to dwell upon with pride.
</P>
<P>
   Early on, Bush surrounded himself with an impressive array of
national security experts, most of them veterans of past Republican
administrations, including Rice, Paul Wolfowitz, Robert Zoellick
and Richard Perle. (The notable exception is James A. Baker, one of
his father's secretaries of state, whose performance in his
father's unsuccessful 1992 campaign the younger Bush has often
faulted).
</P>
<P>
   In a ``coming-out'' speech at the Ronald Reagan Library near Los
Angeles last Nov. 19, George W. Bush won good marks for what most
experts considered a polished performance. His choice of Cheney
lent further heft on foreign policy to the ticket.
</P>
<P>
   But there remains a long list of issues on which the delegates,
and those across the country following the convention in the news
media, have so far heard little. Among them are strategies for
dealing with the intractable problems of Russia and China, the
issue of expanding NATO further into Eastern Europe, the manifold
complications of expanding free world trade and the doubts that
surround the present requirement that the Pentagon be prepared to
fight simultaneous wars in two different theaters of war.
</P>
<P>
   There are divisions within the Republican Party on issues like
Kosovo that have yet to be resolved.
</P>
<P>
   If Bush leaves too much unspoken for too long, he may hand Gore
a significant opening. Gore, after all, has had broad experience in
foreign-policy matters, first on Capitol Hill, then in the White
House. And while the Clinton administration has had its flops
overseas, in places like Africa and Haiti, it has also recorded
significant achievements, particularly in its efforts to promote
peace in Northern Ireland and the Middle East.
</P>
<P>
   But then, Bush may have decided that too much talk about foreign
policy is bad business. He has talked often to friends and
acquaintances about his father's loss to Bill Clinton eight years
ago, when the elder Bush focused on foreign affairs and the
Arkansas neophyte emphasized the economy.

FOR SEN. CONNIE MACK, GOP CONVENTION IS A HOME RUN

Washington Bureau of the NYT Regional Newspapers Group.) 
 By CARL HULSE   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHILADELPHIA _ It is only fitting that one of Sen. Connie Mack's
last political at-bats comes in the city where the name of his
legendary grandfather was synonymous with baseball for half a
century.
</P>
<P>
   For Mack, a Florida Republican who is retiring this year, the
Republican National Convention represents a personal trip around
the bases. His last convention as an elected official is being held
in the city where he was born and spent his youth, regularly
traveling with his parents to old Shibe Park at 21st and Lehigh to
watch the family's Philadelphia Athletics.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is completing the circle,'' said Mack, as he reminisced
Wednesday about his namesake grandfather, known to all as Mr. Mack.
</P>
<P>
   A catcher and middling hitter, the original Connie Mack became
manager and owner of the Athletics with the formation of the
American League at the turn of the 20th century. His teams went on
to win nine pennants and finish last 17 times before Mack, then in
his 80s, retired in 1950. The team eventually relocated to Kansas
City and then Oakland.
</P>
<P>
   Tall and thin, the elder Mack roamed the dugout in starched
civilian clothes and a straw boater, and appeared a bit austere.
But not in the eyes of his grandson.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was my grandfather and he always acted with kindness and
gentleness toward his grandchildren,'' said Mack. His assignment
when the aging manager traveled to Florida for spring training was
to wait in grandfather's room beginning at 5:30 a.m. so he could
provide any assistance needed when Mr. Mack awoke.
</P>
<P>
   Like his grandfather, the senator's name is actually Cornelius
McGillicuddy. And while his grandfather's team once adopted the
Republican elephant symbol as a mascot, Mack's political genes were
inherited from the other side of the family.
</P>
<P>
   A step-grandfather who was also a U.S. senator took Mack, his
parents and siblings to a political luncheon during the 1948 GOP
convention in Philadelphia. Mack, who was 7 at the time, recalls
that for some inexplicable reason he stood up during lunch and
yelled, ``I'm a Republican, I'm a Republican,'' drawing a
grandfatherly rebuke.
</P>
<P>
   ``My political career, without me knowing it, started here in
1948,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Mack, the third-ranking member of the Senate GOP leadership,
announced last year that he would not seek a third term this
November, and instead wanted to chart a new course in his life.
Republicans gathered at the convention are bemoaning his imminent
departure.
</P>
<P>
   ``My golly, the Senate is going to miss him,'' former President
Bush told Florida delegates Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Mack said the whirl of the convention can still stir his juices,
but that he is not second-guessing himself.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I listen to George Bush and Dick Cheney, I can feel my
political instincts become charged,'' Mack said. ``But it is a
totally different kind of environment now. I am more of an observer
at this stage than a participant.''
</P>
<P>
   Mack could have been much more. He had allies such as Senate
Majority Leader Trent Lott of Mississippi eager to push him for the
vice presidency, but Mack declared firmly that he wasn't
interested. His real shot at the No. 2 spot actually came in 1996,
when he was seriously considered by Bob Dole, who later said he
should have selected Mack instead of Jack Kemp.
</P>
<P>
   Mack said Dole might have been scared off by the prospect of
losing a GOP-held Senate seat if their ticket was elected. Mack
said Dole raised the issue during the interview for the job.
</P>
<P>
   ``Going in knowing we might lose a Senate seat, I'm sure that
was something that Bob Dole, with his years of leadership in the
Senate, certainly considered,'' Mack said.
</P>
<P>
   The Mack political line may not be at an end. His son, Connie,
32, is seeking a state legislative seat in South Florida. He is at
the convention with his father, getting some political tips from a
retiring pro.
</P>
<P>
   ``Being here together in Philadelphia is very special,'' Mack
said.

ADVISER TO SOME HOLLYWOOD STARS PLEADS GUILTY TO FRAUD
</HEADLINE>
  By DANNY HAKIM   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ The money manager who promised Hollywood stars and
other artists a safe investment haven pleaded guilty Wednesday to
fraud and admitted to misappropriating some of his clients' funds.
</P>
<P>
   ``What I built became so big that I lost control,'' said Dana C.
Giacchetto, whose Cassandra Group investment advisory firm counted
such stars as Leonardo DiCaprio, Matt Damon and Cameron Diaz among
its clients.
</P>
<P>
   Giacchetto, a 37-year-old Manhattan resident, was charged with
five criminal counts in federal court earlier this year and pleaded
guilty to one of them, fraud under the Investment Advisory Act.
Under terms of the plea agreement, he faces 46 to 57 months in
prison and restitution payments to fraud victims as well as a
possible fine. He is to be sentenced on Nov. 3 by Judge Robert P.
Patterson Jr. of the U.S. District Court in Manhattan. Under the
agreement, the other four counts will be dismissed, but Giacchetto
still faces continuing litigation with the Securities and Exchange
Commission.
</P>
<P>
   Giacchetto managed more than $100 million for more than 300
clients. The Cassandra Group, which he founded, billed itself as a
provider of conservative investments for clients who might be naive
about money.
</P>
<P>
   But according to court documents, Giacchetto misappropriated
more than $9 million of Cassandra clients' money by moving it from
a custodial account to bank accounts controlled by Cassandra. He
also misled some of his clients about why money was being withdrawn
from their accounts, telling them that it was being used to buy
bonds or other investments when it was not.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, Giacchetto used the money to cover a variety of
expenses, according to court documents. Some of the money was used
to pay rent on the Cassandra Group's Manhattan loft, to cover more
than $100,000 of airline tickets and helicopter rides, to pay
individual restaurant bills that in some cases exceeded $15,000,
and to donate $5,000 to the New York Police Scholarship Foundation.
</P>
<P>
   Dressed in light blue prison scrubs, the studious-looking
Giacchetto smiled and chatted amiably with his attorney, Ronald P.
Fischetti, until it was time for him to rise and address the court.
At that point, he began to weep, pausing several times to regain
his composure.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I started Cassandra Group I had the idea that artists
were taken advantage of and exploited,'' he said. ``I'd like to
apologize to everyone I caused harm to.''
</P>
<P>
   He continued: ``I pray and hope we will make reparations and
that no one will lose money. I intended that everyone would get
paid back.''
</P>
<P>
   Exactly how many people lost money is not yet clear, but
attorneys on both sides said they would work to determine that over
the next several months. Fischetti said that reports of Hollywood
stars losing money were exaggerated.
</P>
<P>
   ``None of these stars have lost a dime,'' he said, mentioning
DiCaprio and the actress Courtney Cox Arquette. He added that some
clients that claimed to have had money taken from them actually
lost money because of poor investments.
</P>
<P>
   ``In Hollywood, when a person falls from grace, all his friends
disappear,'' Fischetti added.
</P>
<P>
   But at least a dozen of Cassandra's clients lost ``significant''
amounts, according to Alexander M. Vasilescu, a senior trial
counsel for the SEC.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some have lost hundreds of thousands,'' he added. The rock
band Phish, he said, lost more than $1 million.
</P>
<P>
   Giacchetto was arrested on April 4 and released on a $1 million
bond the same day. He initially pleaded not guilty to all the
charges.
</P>
<P>
   Five days later, he obtained tickets from New York airports to
Los Angeles, Honolulu, Tokyo, Singapore, Germany and Italy,
according to court documents. He was taken into custody at Newark
International Airport on April 12 after violating the terms of his
parole by flying to Las Vegas. When he was arrested, he was
carrying 80 airline tickets and about $4,000 in cash.
</P>
<P>
   In court Wednesday, Giacchetto explained that his firm was named
for ``a prophetess who foretold the fall of Troy.'' Considering
Cassandra, he said the name he chose was ``fitting for someone
contemplating a long term in prison.''

   SEATTLE _ Trot Nixon's parents were still watching on TV back
home in North Carolina. In California, Ed Sprague's wife gave up
after 12 innings and went to bed. Pedro Martinez left Safeco Field
before midnight and returned to the team hotel to rest up for the
next start. Jason Varitek's wife was in Georgia, getting whatever
sleep she could get before their infant daughter woke up again.
</P>
<P>
   It was 3:42 a.m. back in Boston when Varitek squatted for the
271st time and signaled for a fastball from lefthander Jeff
Fassero. Varitek never caught the pitch. Seattle center fielder
Mike Cameron spanked it into the right-field seats and the Mariners
were 5-4 winners in 19 innings. It was the sixth-longest game in
100 years of Red Sox baseball.
</P>
<P>
   Tuesday's game took 5 hours 34 minutes, there were 508 pitches
thrown by 12 hurlers. Sox manager Jimy Williams used 20 of his 24
available players. Brian Daubach, Morgan Burkhart, and Sprague all
played first base. When it ended at almost quarter of 4 in the
morning, there were still 31,000 homes watching the Sox broadcast
back in New England.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wonder how many of 'em threw the remote control at the TV,''
said Sox reliever Derek Lowe. ``There's probably 22,000 at Radio
Shack today getting new controls.''
</P>
<P>
   Sox radioman Joe Castiglione said his producers got calls from
fans listening (on the Internet) in Germany, Australia, Hawaii, and
Samoa.
</P>
<P>
   ``We also heard from a lot of police departments,'' said
Castiglione.
</P>
<P>
   Varitek caught all 19 innings. He didn't get to sleep until 5
a.m., woke at noon, and was at the park at 3 p.m. to prep for
Pedro's first pitch Wednesday night.
</P>
<P>
   ``I tried to get to sleep when we got back,'' said Varitek.
``But it takes a little while to wind down. I'm probably not as
light on my feet today, but I'm all right.''
</P>
<P>
   Varitek, Lowe, Sprague, Rich Garces, Rolando Arrojo, Tim
Wakefield (who started the game and went eight innings), and Rheal
Cormier were among the first at the park Wednesday. Batting
practice was optional and many players arrived later than usual.
Wakefield said he was available for relief. Varitek said his legs
were fine.
</P>
<P>
   The Sox catcher is a Bunyonesque figure with legs that could
move a blocking sled carrying Rod Beck and Rich Garces. Varitek
said he never caught 19 innings before. That's more than a
doubleheader. He admitted he was getting a little weary when the
game stretched into the 14th inning.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had to really focus to keep my concentration, defensively,''
said Varitek. ``When the hitters would come up, I was trying to
remember how we got them out the other sive or six times they were
up. We did a good job with that.''
</P>
<P>
   Although Varitek worked the later innings, a collection of Sox
relievers and bench players _ people who'd already participated _
gathered in front of the enormous clubhouse TV and watched the end
of the game together.
</P>
<P>
   ``There was all of us in here and just nine dudes out there
still playing,'' said Beck, who pitched two innings of perfect
relief.
</P>
<P>
   Varitek won Monday's game with a three-run homer in the eighth
and had a chance to be the hero again, but he popped up the first
pitch he saw from Seattle closer Kazuhiro Sasaki with the bases
loaded and two out in the 19th.
</P>
<P>
   ``That was a better pitch than I had the night before when I hit
the homer,'' said the catcher, who went 1 for 9 on the night. ``I
just sliced through it.''
</P>
<P>
   Fassero, Friday's starter against the Royals at Fenway, had been
told before the game to be ready for bullpen duty because it was
his day to throw and the Sox pen went eight innings in relief of
Ramon Martinez Monday. Bryce Florie, who worked three innings
Monday, was the only Sox reliever who didn't pitch.
</P>
<P>
   Cameron was Seattle's leadoff batter in the 12th and saw 11
pitches before driving the fastball over the wall. He fouled off
seven two-strike serves.
</P>
<P>
   ``He fouled off everything I had,'' said Fassero.
</P>
<P>
   Varitek didn't stick around to see Cameron cross the plate.
Varitek walked straight to the dugout as the Mariners (and the
mascot, Moose, who was wearing pajamas) came out to greet their
hero.
</P>
<P>
   The postgame locker room food spread got some extra attention.
There would be no room service when the team got back to its hotel.
There were still a handful of autograph seekers outside the hotel
when the team bus pulled up after 2 a.m., Seattle time.
</P>
<P>
   ``I told 'em to go the (expletive) home,'' said Beck.

WRITERS TAKE STEPS TO SETTLE RESALE ISSUE
</HEADLINE>
 By FELICITY BARRINGER   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ A group representing free-lance writers, which is
seeking to establish the legitimacy of a central clearinghouse
through which writers can be paid for the resale of old articles _
the same way musicians are paid for the resale of old songs _ is
close to signing an agreement that would give new stature and
visibility to the clearinghouse.
</P>
<P>
   Jonathan Tasini, president of the National Writers' Union, and
Steven D. Brill, chief executive of Contentville, a new online
content distributor, said on Wednesday that they had reached an
agreement. It is now subject to the approval of the union's
executive board, which Tasini said he expected to receive on
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Under the agreement, the two men said, writers who find their
work listed for sale on Contentville.com can assert ownership of
the copyright to the material, and the content distributor will
agree either to pay a fee through the Publication Rights
Clearinghouse, the writers union's organization, or remove the
disputed work from the Contentville site.
</P>
<P>
   The question of online distribution of copyrighted works has
been underscored recently in the debate over Napster, which allows
computer users to exchange music over the Internet. But the issue
for writers is generally different, and the legal debate has taken
a different form.
</P>
<P>
   A federal appellate court decision last September in a case
brought by Tasini and the National Writers' Union struck down the
contention by several publishers _ including The New York Times
Co., Newsday and Time Inc. _ that electronic databases and archives
were analogous to ``collected works.''
</P>
<P>
   Had this view prevailed, free-lance writers _ of whom there are
tens of thousands _ would have been severely limited in claiming
copyright infringement when their works were included in electronic
databases like Lexis-Nexis.
</P>
<P>
   A spokeswoman for the Times Co. and the deputy general counsel
of Time Inc. said on Wednesday that they planned to appeal the case
to the Supreme Court later this month.
</P>
<P>
   When writers' works are sold, there is usually a clear transfer
of ownership. For example, a magazine like Adweek buys material
from a free-lancer. Sometimes writers sell first publication
rights; sometimes they sell the rights in perpetuity.
</P>
<P>
   Adweek then publishes the material. Some time later, it sells
the rights to its archive to a so-called content aggregator, like
Ebsco or Bell and Howell's Information and Learning group. That
aggregator can then resell the database of back articles to a
company like Contentville or Northern Light, or license its use by
a library or educational organization.
</P>
<P>
   Thus, a free-lancer like Steve Ditlea, who lives in the Bronx
and has written for publications from Adweek to Technology Review
to The New York Times, found 65 of his articles for sale on
Contentville.com not long after the site opened for business last
month.
</P>
<P>
   He called Technology Review and found that it had sold the
rights to Ebsco, which in turn had licensed them to Brill's new
site. ``He had the biggest single listing of all my stuff,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   Brill said on Wednesday that he did not know how much material
could potentially be covered by the tentative agreement.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have approximately 2,000 magazines' archives on the site,''
he said. ``We don't know what the universe is of articles there
whose copyright is owned by free-lancers.''
</P>
<P>
   Brill added, ``It's obvious that, to put it mildly, there was
some confusion.'' He and Tasini both said they would seek out
writers to let them know that their material might be for sale on
Contentville, suggesting that they sign up with the Publication
Rights Clearinghouse.
</P>
<P>
   Tasini said the tentative agreement ``opens us up to a whole new
arena whereby huge liabilities can be solved very quickly _ can put
reality behind the rhetoric that we are partners with publishers.''
</P>
<P>
   But Robin Bierstedt, the deputy general counsel of Time, said
that, as described, the Publication Rights Clearinghouse was an
untenable answer to copyright claims. Under current law, she said:
``You need permission in advance before using material. A scheme by
which payment comes after a claim is made doesn't work, unless
you've gotten permission up front.''

POLITICAL SURFING: AT LAST, SOMETHING TO REPORT
</HEADLINE>
 By RICK LYMAN   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   For a while, the cable television reporters and Internet
correspondents seemed energized, if a little startled, by the
prospect of actual news to report from the Republican National
Convention. Until Wednesday, as has been endlessly pointed out, the
convention had been a carefully scripted infomercial punctuated by
scattered protests and pundits on autopilot.
</P>
<P>
   But suddenly there was the disclosure that former President
Gerald R. Ford had gone to the hospital with what was thought to be
a sinus infection but was actually a stroke. That followed the
beginning of a whiff of a semi-controversy about former President
George Bush attacking President Clinton for attacking his son.
</P>
<P>
   The all-news channels and streaming Web sites suddenly had
something to cut back to regularly (correspondents standing outside
the hospital, promising updates on Ford's condition) and a fresh
bone to gnaw on (whether Bush should have kept quiet).
</P>
<P>
   Some news outlets that had done interviews with Ford on Tuesday,
before he was hospitalized, replayed the tapes throughout the
afternoon, so viewers could watch the 87-year-old former president
slurring his words.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, the pundit class was making much of Bush's
remark that he was growing irritated with President Clinton's
attacks on his son. This allowed Democrats and some pundits to
argue that Gov. George W. Bush of Texas apparently needed his daddy
to protect him.
</P>
<P>
   Teapot Dome it was not. But it was about the only spice on the
menu.
</P>
<P>
   Wednesday morning, when President Bush and his wife, Barbara,
appeared on ABC's ``Good Morning, America,'' he was promising to be
good. ``They're making a federal case about it,'' he said. ``It's
better to say nothing about it, future, now, nothing, period.''
</P>
<P>
   The show's host, Charles Gibson, however, knew raw meat when he
saw it and prodded once more. ``Not going to talk about it,'' Bush
insisted.
</P>
<P>
   Then Mrs. Bush jumped to her husband's aid, saying that his was
not really a personal attack, just an observation about the state
of the presidency.
</P>
<P>
   Again, Gibson detected sirloin. Oh, is there something wrong
with the state of the presidency? Has it been sullied? And who
might have been responsible for that?
</P>
<P>
   ``You know who I mean,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Bush tried to shush his wife. ``They're going to get all over
your case,'' he warned.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't care,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   There they were, working it out, right on live television. It
was like being a fly on the wall in Kennebunkport, Maine.
</P>
<P>
   By the end of the day, though, the pundits seemed to have gnawed
all the meat off the bone. Besides, Governor Bush had finally
arrived in Philadelphia after stalking the convention for three
days, and was himself criticizing Clinton and Vice President Al
Gore.
</P>
<P>
   ``The media is making too much of this,'' a former White House
communications director, Don Bauer, said in response to an e-mail
question on a live ``Talk Back'' segment on CNN. ``They love a
sideshow.''
</P>
<P>
   Speakout.com continued its experiment with MSNBC, offering Web
surfers the opportunity to rate the impact of the major convention
speeches as they were being delivered. Those at home could
manipulate bars on their computer screens as a speech was being
given to indicate whether they agreed or disagreed with the
speaker.
</P>
<P>
   The verdict on Sen. John McCain's speech on Tuesday night was
that men and women liked it much the same. Democrats and
independents were put off by the middle of the speech, when the
senator talked about national pride.
</P>
<P>
   This just in: A live Web cam trained on the convention podium at
2:20 p.m. showed two people standing next to a big plant, talking.
It was too dark to see who they were. Another Web cam, at 3:35
p.m., trained on the main entrance outside showed an empty golf
cart and a man leaning against a chain-link fence. His back was to
the camera, but he was wearing a bright green shirt.
</P>
<P>
   In a column for the CNN Web page, Robert Novak disclosed what
had been the unspoken scandal of this convention, the scarcity of
tickets to key events. Seats that once would have gone to party big
shots were going this year to major donors. The Republican
money-raisers have ``hijacked the party,'' complained the Ohio
Republican chairman, Robert Bennett.
</P>
<P>
   For political junkies, Howard Mortman, national editor for the
Hotline, the Web site produced by the National Journal Group,
continued his series of ``Extreme Mortman'' columns, in which he
makes the convention party scene. He wrote of seeing the pundit Ann
Coulter momentarily resist a television reporter's interview
request before she ``succumbed to the temptations of the forbidden
microphone fruit.''
</P>
<P>
   And Lewis Black, a political humorist reporting for the Comedy
Central cable network, complained in a streaming Web feed that he
and his colleagues had been refused floor credentials and had been
reduced to covering the event from a college dormitory several
miles away.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we had any brains, we could have been on a cruise ship,
watching it on television and sipping cocktails,'' Black said.
</P>
<P>
   Make ours a double.

GRAND RABBI SHLOMO HALBERSTAM, 92, LEADER OF BOBOV HASIDIM 
</HEADLINE>
   By BLAINE HARDEN   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Grand Rabbi Shlomo Halberstam, a Holocaust survivor
whose gentle charisma nurtured the exuberant postwar rebirth of the
Bobov Hasidic sect in Brooklyn and around the world, died at
Maimonides Medical Center on Wednesday after a long illness. He was
92.
</P>
<P>
   A regal-looking man with a great silver beard and horn-rimmed
glasses, Rabbi Halberstam was known for his love of dancing with
the Torah and for his artful way of sidestepping the internal
squabbles that plague other Hasidic sects.
</P>
<P>
   But his enduring accomplishment, Judaic scholars say, was
rebuilding the Bobov sect, a group of Jews based in southeastern
Poland that was nearly exterminated by the Nazis during World War
II.
</P>
<P>
   Under 55 years of his consistently conciliatory leadership, the
Bobovers became the leading Hasidic group in Borough Park, which is
the most Hasidic section of Brooklyn. It is a neighborhood, city
planners say, where the fertility rate is double that of New York
as a whole, where families with eight children are not unusual and
where Halberstam convinced ultra-Orthodox Jews that they could
thrive without compromising their way of life.
</P>
<P>
   At his funeral Wednesday, about 6,000 mourners crushed into
Bobover Yeshiva Bnei Zion at 15th Avenue and 48th Street, with an
additional 30,000 or so standing outside in steaming heat listening
to loudspeakers. During the ceremony, many mourners wailed and
ripped their clothing, signifying that the rabbi was like a father
to them.
</P>
<P>
   Halberstam's two sons spoke at the service. Rabbi Naftali
Halberstam, the eldest and the chosen successor in the Bobov sect,
escaped the Nazis with his father and came to New York after the
war. He spoke of his grandfather, the Bobover grand rabbi, who was
killed by the Nazis. The second son, Rabbi Ben Zion Halberstam,
said his father had picked up the ashes from the Holocaust and
created the community that was now mourning him.
</P>
<P>
   The Bobover Hasidim are part of an ecstatic religious movement
of the late 17th century that broke from traditional rabbinical
Judaism for reasons that included objections about materialistic
excess. The various sects among the Hasidim share similar beliefs,
with their differences owing to geographical origin, dress and
style of leadership among grand rabbis.
</P>
<P>
   The Bobovers, whose name derives from a village in southeastern
Poland, tend to look to their grand rabbi more than most other
sects for advice on business, marriage and family matters,
according to William B. Helmreich, a professor of sociology and
Judaic studies at the City University of New York.
</P>
<P>
   ``Bobover Hasidim is known for not emphasizing disputes,'' said
Helmreich, author of ``The World of the Yeshiva'' (Ktav, 2000).
``They are considered very open and tolerant to other groups.''
</P>
<P>
   Several Judaic experts said Halberstam enjoyed extraordinary
success in recruiting Jews in America to the Bobov sect because he
was both nonconfrontational and charismatic.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is a market economy in America in religion, and whoever
has the charisma attracts the most people,'' said Samuel Heilman, a
professor of Jewish studies and sociology at Queens College.
``Rabbi Halberstam was successful, and the numbers show that.''
</P>
<P>
   Heilman estimated there are 20,000 followers of the Bobov sect,
although some other Jewish leaders said the sect had more than
100,000 members who are concentrated in New York, Montreal,
Toronto, Miami and London.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike the Satmar and Lubavitch Hasidic sects, which are also
prominent in Brooklyn, the Bobovers have flourished with little
public infighting. A leadership squabble dating to the death 21
years ago of a grand rabbi continues to divide the Satmar sect, and
the Lubavitch movement remains riven by a dispute over whether
their late leader, Rabbi Menachem Mendel Schneerson, was the
Messiah.
</P>
<P>
   Halberstam years ago designated his oldest son as his successor,
Heilman said. At the funeral Wednesday, he said the congregation
enthusiastically welcomed the son as their new leader.
</P>
<P>
   Halberstam arrived in New York in the late 1940s, with only his
oldest son. The rest of his family had been killed. During this
time, according to Heilman, he apparently had a crisis of faith,
shaved his beard and lost his desire to be a rabbi. But he soon
recovered and, Heilman said, his crisis of faith proved
inspirational to many Orthodox Jews reeling in poverty and
psychological distress in the wake of the war.
</P>
<P>
   ``Many of his followers felt that if the rabbi can forgive God
for the Holocaust, then we can, too,'' Heilman said.
</P>
<P>
   Halberstam took great pleasure in dancing and singing. His
dancing frames a recent documentary movie about the Hasidim called
``A World Apart _ Hasidic Life in America.''
</P>
<P>
   Halberstam is survived by his two sons and five daughters, along
with many grandchildren and great-grandchildren.

MRS. CLINTON ASSAILS LAZIO ON `MULTIPLE CHOICE' STAND ON ABORTION
</HEADLINE>
   (With LAZIO) 
 By ELISABETH BUMILLER   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   OLD WESTBURY, N.Y. _ Hillary Rodham Clinton received the
endorsement of Planned Parenthood on Wednesday and used the
occasion to exhaustively criticize Rep. Rick Lazio, her Republican
opponent in the U.S. Senate race, for his position on abortion and
for what she implied was his petulant reaction to her attacks.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you say something that's accurate about someone's record,
if they don't want anybody to know about it, they say it's
negative,'' Clinton told a group of several hundred people at the
State University of New York here.
</P>
<P>
   ``So for weeks now, I have said that he sided with the insurance
companies and voted for the Republican patients' bill of rights
instead of a patients' bill of rights that will hold HMOs
accountable,'' she continued. ``And I mean, my goodness, he just
has gone crazy about that. He had everybody saying that that was so
negative, and so mean. I don't understand it. He's either going to
accept his record, or he's going to have to continue to try to run
away from it and avoid accountability for it.''
</P>
<P>
   Last year Lazio opposed a Democratic version of a so-called
patients' bill of rights that would give patients the right to sue
health maintenance organizations for mistreatment. Lazio supported
a Republican bill that instead would provide tax deductions to help
people pay their medical premiums.
</P>
<P>
   The Planned Parenthood endorsement, from both the national
organization and the New York state chapter, was hardly unexpected
for the first lady. But Gloria Feldt, the president of the national
Planned Parenthood organization, said that the group would have
stayed neutral if Clinton's former opponent, New York City Mayor
Rudolph Giuliani, had remained in the race. Giuliani is a strong
supporter of abortion rights.
</P>
<P>
   ``Once Lazio got in the race, it was an easy decision,'' Feldt
said.
</P>
<P>
   On her second day of a three-day campaign swing through the
heart of Long Island, Lazio's home territory, Clinton also said in
an interview that she thought she would win at least ``parts of''
the area. ``I have no illusions about how difficult it is for a
Democrat or for me to do well in the suburbs,'' she said, ``but I'm
not going to concede one vote.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton said she was startled by the favorable reception she
received this morning at the Hicksville station of the Long Island
Rail Road, where she greeted commuters. ``You know, I've been in
lots of different settings politically for a long time,'' she said.
``And when people really aren't interested in you, or really don't
like you, they let it be known. And I had so many people wishing me
luck, telling me they were going to vote for me. It was a big
surprise to me.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton made her remarks about Lazio during a 40-minute speech
on women's issues, when she said, as she has in the past, that
Lazio is not pro-choice on abortion rights but ``multiple choice.''
Although Lazio generally supports abortion rights, he opposes the
use of government money to pay for abortions.
</P>
<P>
   ``I believe in choice for all women, not just some women,''
Clinton said.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton was accompanied again Wednesday by her daughter,
Chelsea, who is taking a leave from Stanford University to campaign
with her mother and experience the last months of her father's
presidency. Chelsea, 20, sat next to her mother on the stage during
the introductory remarks at the college, then shook hands and
signed autographs on her own after the first lady's speech.

TMS adds Roos School 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Texas Motor Speedway has reached an agreement for its first
road-racing school. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The Bertil Roos Racing School is scheduled to conduct its array
of programs, ranging from half-day introductory to three-day
advanced driving, on the infield road-course layouts. Classes are
scheduled to begin in November for approximately 35 days of
activity. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``We've signed a lease with Bertil Roos, and that's exciting
news for road-racing fans in our area,'' said Eddie Gossage, TMS'
executive vice president and general manager. ``It gives us another
dimension of racing school you can take here, and they're looking
for a place that's warmer in the wintertime.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The addition of TMS is the final piece of an 18-month Roos
expansion plan that has included the development of programs at
Virginia International Raceway and additional dates at the school's
home facility, Pocono Raceway. The school is headquartered in
Blakeslee, Pa. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Roos' competition courses are Sports Car Club of
America-approved[ ,] and fulfill the schooling requirements for a
racing license. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``They do a great job, and it gives people another reason to
come to Texas Motor Speedway,'' Gossage said. ``We've just added
another 35 tourism days to the community.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Gossage also said he is close to signing a second road-racing
school _ believed to be operated by American Le Mans Series founder
Don Panoz _ for an extended term. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``We've got one other school we've come to terms with for
another 100 days,'' Gossage said. ``We haven't signed the paper,
but that will come shortly. There are some other elements to it.
It's more than rental of track time.''  &QL; 
 &QL; 
ALMS to switch date &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The American Le Mans Series' debut on the combined oval//infield
road-course at Texas Motor Speedway on Sept. 2 apparently will be a
one-shot deal for the Labor Day weekend. Series founder Don Panoz
told /{On Track/} magazine that the second Grand Prix of Texas will
kick off the 2001 ALMS season at TMS in early March. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``That appears to be the case,'' said Eddie Gossage, TMS'
executive vice president and general manager. ``Truth is, we
haven't firmed up anything yet. But if that's what they want to do,
that's fine.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   If the sports cars run in Fort Worth in March, it will give
Texas Motor Speedway major weekends in four consecutive months:
American Le Mans Series (March), NASCAR Winston Cup//Busch Grand
National (April), Championship Auto Racing Teams FedEx Series (May)
and Indy Racing Northern Light Series//NASCAR Craftsman Trucks
(June). &QL; 
 &QL; 
Truck sponsor signed &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Arlington-based Berryman Products has signed on as primary
sponsor for B.A. Wilson and the Sonntag Racing team in the NASCAR
Craftsman Truck Series. The company, which produces automotive
chemicals, will serve as primary sponsor through the rest of the
2000 season and be an associate on the team's Chevrolet in 2001. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Wilson, who has logged one top-10 finish for the Little
Elm-based team, is 22nd in points. The Carrollton resident plans to
return to Fort Worth for the O'Reilly 300 NCTS race at Texas Motor
Speedway on Oct. 13. The last word There's nothing but one spot in
racing, and if you've ever been there _ No. 1 _ you never want to
settle for second, third, fourth or whatever.'' _ A.J. Foyt, on the
goal for his rookie NASCAR Winston Cup program / nn

JORGE OSCAR DE MELLO FLORES, INFLUENTIAL BRAZILIAN, DIES AT 88 
</HEADLINE>
   By SIMON ROMERO    
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Jorge Oscar de Mello Flores, a businessman who worked behind the
scenes to influence important political events in Brazil, died on
Monday in Rio de Janeiro. He was 88.
</P>
<P>
   Flores was known for getting business interests to support the
military coup that deposed President Joao Goulart in 1964. He later
formed close ties with Humberto Castelo Branco, the army general
who took control of Brazil's central government.
</P>
<P>
   Through a lobby called the Brazilian Institute of Democratic
Action, which he formed, Flores continued after the coup to
organize the support of private companies and wealthy individuals
for authoritarian rule. The institute is believed to have collected
millions of dollars against Communism.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was unapologetic in his belief that Communism was a threat
to the economic well-being of Brazil,'' said Maria Celina D'Araujo,
a political scientist at the Fundacao Getulio Vargas, an economics
institute in Rio de Janeiro. ``He took a certain pride in being one
of the coup's top conspirators.''
</P>
<P>
   Flores stayed close to Gen. Castelo Branco but fell out with his
successor, Gen. Artur da Costa e Silva, in the middle to late '60s.
But though Flores' political influence waned, his economic power
did not.
</P>
<P>
   In 1969 he became president of Chase Manhattan's banking
operations in Brazil, a position he held until 1992, six years
after civilian rule was re-established. He then became president of
the Fundacao Getulio Vargas.
</P>
<P>
   Wielding political influence came naturally to Flores. He was
born into an upper-class family in Rio, then Brazil's capital, in
1912. Part of his family descended from Portuguese nobility who
arrived in Brazil in 1808.
</P>
<P>
   As a civil servant in Rio in the 1930s, Flores wove a formidable
network of connections, which he later used as a director of the
Sul America insurance group. He eventually invested in industrial
manufacturing and financial services businesses.
</P>
<P>
   In 1959 he founded Consultec, an economic consulting company,
together with Roberto Campos, a leading diplomat and right-wing
politician. Mario Henrique Simonsen, perhaps Brazil's most
influential economist, became a partner of Consultec at Flores'
urging.
</P>
<P>
   In some ways Flores was a precursor to the bankers and
economists who today shuttle between high-level jobs in Brazil's
private and public sectors, said Guilherme Fiuza, an editor of No.,
an online political and cultural newspaper in Rio.
</P>
<P>
   He was one of the eminences grises who are central to
deciphering the workings of Brazilian politics.
</P>
<P>
   For example in the 1970s Flores, having strengthened his ties
with the military government, smoothed Simonsen's path to the
Finance Ministry. He described a 1974 discussion with Gen. Golbery
do Couto e Silva, chief political strategist to President Ernesto
Geisel: ``We discussed the matter and we both decided it would be a
great solution for the country,'' Flores said of Simonsen's
appointment.
</P>
<P>
   Flores is survived by his wife, Wanda Dias Flores, a daughter
and a grandson.

   INDIANAPOLIS _ Calendars everywhere have been flipped over to
August, and Gasoline Alley at the Indianapolis Motor Speedway is
reverberating with the sounds of stock-car V-8 engines. It can only
mean that the Dog Days of NASCAR's championship season are upon us.
</P>
<P>
   Saturday's scheduled running of the Brickyard 400 here will
begin a stretch of 12 consecutive race weekends that is the longest
stint on the 34-event Winston Cup tour. The next scheduled
off-weekend is Oct. 29, well into football season and one week
after the Cup series mercifully rolls into Rockingham, N.C., for
its second visit to the North Carolina Speedway.
</P>
<P>
   Three of 12 races during this run will be contested on Saturdays
_ this weekend's seventh annual extravaganza before 320,000 fans at
the history-laden Speedway; the must-see fender-bending action of
night racing on the high-banked, half-mile Bristol Motor Speedway
on Aug. 26; and the similarly enticing under-the-lights race at
Richmond International Raceway on Sept. 9.
</P>
<P>
   Also included in this marathon is the second and final
road-course event of 2000 at Watkins Glen International on Aug. 13;
all the Labor Day weekend traditions associated with Darlington
Raceway on Sept. 3, and the last of the four restrictor-plate races
at the Talladega Superspeedway on Oct. 15.
</P>
<P>
   The results racked up during this stretch surely will reveal the
identity of the 2000 Cup champion.
</P>
<P>
   Native Texan Bobby Labonte is a tenuous 53 points ahead of Dale
Jarrett, the reigning series champion and winner of the 1999
Brickyard 400. And while third-place Dale Earnhardt's quest for an
unprecedented eighth Cup championship carries a ton of sentimental
weight among NASCAR's fandom, it is Jarrett whom Labonte will need
to beat for his first Cup title.
</P>
<P>
   Jarrett's fourth-place finish in the Pennsylvania 500 at Pocono
Raceway on July 23, combined with Earnhardt's flat-tire induced
25th-place result, allowed the former to pass ``The Intimidator''
and move to within striking distance of Labonte. Jarrett's finish
at Pocono was his 15th top-10 result in 19 starts, including his
lone victory in the season-opening Daytona 500. Jarrett's Pocono
result also was his 10th consecutive top-10 finish of the season.
</P>
<P>
   Sound familiar? It is exactly the same grind-it-out consistency
that carried Jarrett to the 1999 championship by 201 points over
Labonte.
</P>
<P>
   With his victory here last year, Jarrett joined Jeff Gordon as a
two-time winner of NASCAR's richest race and tacked 20 points onto
his championship lead (274 points) over runner-up Mark Martin.
Beginning with his Brickyard 400 victory _ the last of his four
victories in 1999 _ Jarrett recorded nine top-five and 12 top-10
finishes en route to joining his father, Ned, as a NASCAR champion.
</P>
<P>
   The current difference between Labonte and 10th-place Ricky Rudd
is 357 points, second at this juncture of the season only to the
1989 race (343 points) since the inception of the current scoring
system in 1975. Given that fact, Jarrett is pleased to be back at
IMS, one of his most productive arenas.
</P>
<P>
   ``It has been incredible this year with the competition,'' said
Jarrett, who has two victories, four top-five and four top-10
finishes in six Brickyard 400 starts. ``Being able to get in the
top-five, it shows we have performed reasonably well for the first
half of the season. But we feel like we can perform at a higher
level in the second half.''
</P>
<P>
   For Jarrett to overtake Labonte, and draw away from Earnhardt,
he will need to do just that. If Labonte were to continue at his
current pace of scoring 148.7 points per race (approximately
sixth-place finishes), Jarrett would need to average 153 points per
race (approximately fifth-place finishes) to pass him. And
Earnhardt, currently 107 points behind Labonte, would need to
average 156 points per race (approximately fourth-place finishes)
to overhaul them both.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's still a wide-open race,'' said Jarrett, driver of the No.
88 Quality Care Service/Ford Credit Taurus. ``I think there are
still 10 or 12 that have a legitimate shot at winning the
championship.''
</P>
<P>
   Beginning this weekend, the Dog Days of NASCAR will help reveal
the champion's identity ... as Dale Jarrett.

   INDIANAPOLIS _ A.J. Foyt did not single-handedly shape the
mystique surrounding the Indianapolis Motor Speedway. But the
history and traditions of the 2.5-mile rectangular oval would be
considerably less colorful without the contributions of Foyt, the
first four-time winner of the Indianapolis 500.
</P>
<P>
   Despite his open-wheel racing legacy, Foyt always has
appreciated the competitiveness of NASCAR's Winston Cup Series. And
he was foremost among the Indy-car crowd favoring the addition of
the Brickyard 400 to the IMS schedule in 1994. Foyt, who competed
in that first Brickyard at age 59, returns to the Speedway this
week as a first-time Cup car owner. And although his rookie team is
only beginning to look respectable, there is no doubt that A.J.
``owns'' the Speedway.
</P>
<P>
   ``You just bask in the glow,'' said veteran Rick Mast, Foyt's
latest full-time driver. ``It's pretty cool to go to Indy with A.J.
I went there a few years ago on qualifying day with him for the
Indy-car race and watched how these people responded to him. But I
also learned in 1994 when I got the pole ... A.J. was running that
day, and I spent a little bit of time with him. In fact, I asked
him for some advice on that particular day.''
</P>
<P>
   Winning the inaugural Brickyard 400 pole remains the highlight
of Mast's 13-year Cup career.
</P>
<P>
   Mast's eighth-place result at Pocono Raceway on July 23 was the
first top-10 Cup finish as a car owner for Foyt, whose patience and
pride have been stretched by his start-up operation.
</P>
<P>
   Mast made his debut for Foyt in the DirecTV 500 at Texas Motor
Speedway in Fort Worth on April 2. Mast drove the No. 14 Conseco
Pontiac Grand Prix to a 20th-place finish that day, securing a seat
formerly occupied by rookie Mike Bliss and the timeless Dick
Trickle. But when Mast failed to qualify for the subsequent events
at the Martinsville and Talladega speedways, Foyt blew a fuse.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's when I said, `I've got to make changes because this
ain't going to fly with myself or with my partner, Conseco,' ''
Foyt said. ``I got pretty disgusted because I'm not going to the
races to watch. If I can't have cars that are competitive and be up
front, that's not my style of racing. I just didn't go home, put my
tail between my legs and say, `Well, I just didn't cut it.' I felt
like I could put a team together that could make a big difference
and be competitive.''
</P>
<P>
   Foyt's reshaped team features Cup veteran and Texan Phillipe
Lopez as crew chief. Foyt also has started an in-house engine
program headed by builder David Evans. More significant, Foyt has
reassigned nephew Tommy LaMance from his championship and Indy
500-winning Indy Racing League program to the Winston Cup team.
LaMance is general manager of Foyt's Cup organization in Charlotte,
N.C.
</P>
<P>
   ``That way there, I've got a good report coming back to me 24
hours a day,'' said Foyt, who is not above dreaming about a
Brickyard 400 victory this weekend. ``It would mean a lot to me.
I've been very fortunate at Indianapolis Motor Speedway. To be able
to chalk up a Brickyard ... I know I would be so ecstatic; I
couldn't talk.''

   MEMPHIS, Tenn. _ Houston, you've become a problem.
</P>
<P>
   It was just 20 years ago under former coach Bill Yeoman that the
Cougars were a force playing in a relic called the Southwest
Conference. Lately, there have been few highs for ``Cougar High.''
While Conference USA provided Houston a safe haven when the SWC
folded, C-USA has had reasons to vote them off the island.
</P>
<P>
   In four seasons in C-USA, Houston has an overall record of 20-25
and an 11-12 league record (highlighted by a shared C-USA title in
1996). Since going 10-1 in 1990, Houston's overall record is
30-67-1. Over the past four seasons, Houston's attendance average
is 19,792.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have to develop a way to win consistently,'' Dana Dimel,
the Cougars' first-year coach, said at yesterday's C-USA media
meetings. ``We need to get to where we win seven to eight games
each season and are in the mix for the conference title every year.
We did that at Wyoming, and we can do it at Houston.''
</P>
<P>
   Two NCAA probations and a losing decade contributed to the
program's problems. But more than anything, Houston turned away
from Texas' fertile high school talent. Dimel, who for the past 13
years has recruited in the state, plans to change that. In May,
Dimel and his staff visited 700 Texas high schools. The message:
``This is Houston, we're back, we need you.''
</P>
<P>
   ``You have to understand the science of recruiting in Texas,''
said Dimel, a 10-year Kansas State assistant who was 23-12 in two
seasons at Wyoming. ``We're not going after the blue-chip recruit
that is considering Texas or Texas A&AMP;M. But even eliminating those
players, there's still a ton of talent in the state. We're looking
for good people who can run fast.
</P>
<P>
   ``Houston has the facilities, resources and the recruiting base
to be a solid program. And I think the conference needs us be a
solid contender.''
</P>
<P>
   Dimel isn't on Mission Impossible. Houston was 7-4 last season.
Senior quarterback Jason McKinley has started for three seasons and
appears a perfect fit for Dimel's offense, which features a
one-back set and lots of passing. Just don't expect a return to the
run-and-shoot and high-scoring games, Dimel said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Last year everybody had long faces all the time, coaches and
players,'' senior wide receiver Orlando Iglesias said. ``Now,
everybody is having fun. We had a winning record last year so deep
down we know we have what it takes to win.''
</P>
<P>
   Dimel said September will determine his team's fate in 2000. The
Cougars play at Rice, LSU and Texas with home games against Army
and SMU.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we can come out of September with a winning record, we
could have a good season,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   While Southern Mississippi, East Carolina and Tulane have had
flashes of success on the national scene, C-USA commissioner Mike
Slive said the league needs a healthy Houston.
</P>
<P>
   ``Not only is Houston a major market and a significant sports
town, it has served as our nexus in the state of Texas,'' he said.
``You have to look a program over a long period, not just a snap
shot. Houston has significant history and tradition. I think
they'll be able to bring back that kind of success.''

<P>
   PHILADELPHIA _ Burning to reclaim the White House after eight
years on the outside, the Republican Party nominated George Walker
Bush for president on Wednesday night and sent forth his running
mate with the most stinging and unabashedly partisan attack of the
convention.
</P>
<P>
   Dick Cheney, Bush's No. 2, asserted that the election of Al Gore
would perpetuate what he called the failed policies of President
Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are all a little weary of the Clinton-Gore routine,''
Cheney declared in his prepared remarks. ``But the wheel has
turned.''
</P>
<P>
   Then, appropriating Gore's slogan from the 1992 campaign as his
own, he said, ``It is time for them to go!''
</P>
<P>
   In the ritual roll call, the 22 votes from Cheney's home state
of Wyoming gave Bush just after 10 p.m. more than the 1,034 votes
needed for the nomination.
</P>
<P>
   Cheney, a secretary of defense under President Bush before
becoming a business executive, said he was lured back into public
service because of his belief in George W. Bush and his fear that
Gore's election would perpetuate everything that he believed was
wrong with Clinton's stewardship.
</P>
<P>
   Drawing a contrast with Bush's achievements as governor of
Texas, Cheney contended that the Clinton administration had made no
headway on Social Security, taxes or military readiness.
</P>
<P>
   Casting aside the high-minded oratory that had marked this
convention until now, Cheney portrayed Gore as mean-spirited by
reviving former Sen. Bill Bradley's pungent dismissal of Gore just
six days before the crucial New Hampshire primary: ``A thousand
promises. A thousand attacks.''

<P>
   FORT WORTH, Texas _ Mary O'Connell is one of the best equestrian
coaches in the world. She could have stayed in her hometown of
Dublin, Ireland, to teach. Or she could have coached at an elite
East Coast equestrian center. Instead, she chose Texas.
</P>
<P>
   Now, she spends most of the year in Fort Worth freelancing as an
equestrian instructor and travels back to Ireland in spring and at
the end of summer to coach.
</P>
<P>
   For O'Connell, 45, it's the best of both worlds.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't miss Ireland that much, because I get to go back quite
a bit,'' said O'Connell, who lives in Fort Worth with her husband,
Daniel, and 8-month-old son, Brendon. ``I like Fort Worth because
it's easygoing in the fast-paced world we live in _ even though the
heat is a bit hard for training horses.''
</P>
<P>
   Known professionally by her maiden name, Mary D'Arcy, O'Connell
will coach the Irish senior equestrian three-day event team at the
2000 Summer Olympic Games in Sydney.
</P>
<P>
   She has coached at all of the major equestrian championships
since 1990, including England's prestigious Badminton Horse Trials.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are blessed to have her here, because most of the big names
are on the East Coast or West Coast,'' said Dr. Terri Lindsay, a
student of O'Connell's. ``I would follow her anywhere she goes. She
sees the frustration as you learn and works you through it. She
always leaves you with something positive, so there is something
that always draws you back to her.''
</P>
<P>
   O'Connell came to Fort Worth in 1983 to work as a consultant for
the now-defunct Talland II, a riding center in Burleson.
</P>
<P>
   ``The opportunity was here at the time,'' she said. ``I liked
the town and the people. It was similar to Ireland because it
wasn't fast-moving and I enjoyed the Western heritage and the
Southern hospitality.''
</P>
<P>
   O'Connell now freelances at the Curragh Equestrian Center in
Fort Worth and at private farms. She occasionally helps local
Western riders who come to her wanting to improve their balance and
to learn ``flying changes,'' where the rider gets the horse to
switch leads during loping, the Western form of cantering.
</P>
<P>
   ``Western riding is a huge factor here, because years ago, with
the farms and ranches, they were outside riding on the farm,'' she
said. ``So they are natural riders.''
</P>
<P>
   O'Connell returned to Ireland last week to prepare her Olympic
riders for the three-day event, a triathlon of sorts that tests a
horse's and rider's ability in show jumping, dressage (often
described as horses performing ballet) and cross-country
competitions.
</P>
<P>
   Equestrian events made their debut in the Olympics in 1912.
Women were not allowed to participate in the events until 1952.
Now, it's the only Olympic sport where men and women compete
together.
</P>
<P>
   O'Connell's experience coaching Ireland's Young Riders (16- to
21-year-olds) three-day event team to their first gold medal at the
1995 European Championships helped catapult her into the Olympics
this year.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's everybody's dream as a coach or an athlete,'' O'Connell
said. ``The whole point of the Olympics is to compete as a
competitor or as a coach. This is a fulfillment of a lifetime's
worth of work.''
</P>
<P>
   O'Connell's road to the Olympics began at age 10, when a friend
convinced her to take riding lessons. She felt an instant
connection.
</P>
<P>
   ``My mother was a little horrified that I didn't go into the
normal pursuits of a lady,'' O'Connell said. ``Like being a flight
attendant, a beautician or a lawyer.''
</P>
<P>
   She continued to ride at a local pony club near Dublin, but
stopped for a year when she turned 13. That year was more than
enough, and she hasn't taken a break since.
</P>
<P>
   ``Once you get horses in your blood, its hard to get it out of
you,'' she said. ``After that, you go up to the riding school,
helping out on the holidays, and then you are there practically
every waking hour.''
</P>
<P>
   While in high school, O'Connell learned from the best, taking
the first of six teaching exams with the British Equestrian
Society. It was there that she learned how to teach people of all
ages and skill levels. She completed her training in only seven
years, compared to the 30 years it takes some people to finish.
</P>
<P>
   O'Connell said she decided to become an instructor because she
could compete and teach for a living.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't know at the time, but I seem to take to teaching
people,'' she said. ``That's something you discover over time.''
</P>
<P>
   O'Connell was quite the competitor as well.
</P>
<P>
   Among other accomplishments, she has won the Hunter Championship
at the Dublin Horse Show and placed second at the national
three-day event championship in Ireland.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was able to compete in all the disciplines, which is very
hard to do, which meant I was then able to coach all of them,'' she
said. ``If I didn't compete in them, it's like saying can you teach
me to drive a car, if you've never driven one.''

COWBOYS GUARD GARMON, SIDELINED SINCE 1998, WORKS TO CATCH UP
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients)

c.2000 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
 
 
 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   IRVING, Texas _ Kelvin Garmon's right leg bears no visible
reminders of the pain it put him through the past two years. Soon,
though, Garmon will need only to look at his wall to remember how
far he has come.
</P>
<P>
   The titanium rod and four screws that held Garmon's tibia
together for 10 months are being framed, along with the date of his
surgery _ Nov. 8, 1998 _ and the date he was drafted _ April 18,
1999. It will hang in a prominent place in his house.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's going to be something special, you know,'' said Garmon, a
former Haltom High School standout. ``It's one of those things that
when you get through it, you've got to be proud of what you did.''
</P>
<P>
   Garmon's football career is healing as satisfactorily as his
leg. After missing about 21 months after suffering a fractured bone
in his lower leg] near the end of his senior season at Baylor,
Garmon returned to competition Saturday when he started for the
Cowboys against the Pittsburgh Steelers.
</P>
<P>
   Garmon, filling in for injured All-Pro left guard Larry Allen,
played 18 plays in the Cowboys' 38-10 exhibition loss. By all
accounts, Garmon held his own.
</P>
<P>
   ``He needs to work on reacting to the quickness of the game,''
Cowboys offensive line coach Hudson Houck said. ``He needs to work
on exactly what his job is on each play. There are some real
subtleties that you only can learn through experience. Seeing a
number of different defenses and seeing a number of different
movements out of the defense comes with experience, and we're
trying to give him that.''
</P>
<P>
   Garmon was dealt a bad break on the first series of a 49-6
Baylor loss to Kansas State two seasons ago. In what Garmon calls
``a freak injury,'' he was running down the field when he was hit
by a fallen player. Garmon heard a pop, which was quickly followed
by a jolt of pain.
</P>
<P>
   ``Your whole body can't move. You just sit there like `uh, oh,'
'' Garmon said. ``When you have an injury like that, the first
thing you think is, `I'm not going to be able to play football
again.' Everything goes by so fast. You think about your family. A
hundred different things go through your mind in a second. You have
to settle down and get rid of the shock before you start thinking
clearly again.''
</P>
<P>
   James Bowden, an orthopedic surgeon in Waco, performed two hours
of surgery on Garmon's leg. When he was finished, Bowden told
Garmon that under the best of circumstances, Garmon could resume
his career in 2000.
</P>
<P>
   ``Kelvin had a bad fracture with a lot of swelling,'' Bowden
said. ``I told him there was no reason that it ought to affect his
career, but he had to be patient. ...It's not how strong the bone
is, but how strong the leg is. It was unreasonable to think he
could compete at the professional level in a year's time.''
</P>
<P>
   With his college career over and his pro career yet to begin,
Garmon suddenly had a cloudy future. Lying in his hospital bed,
Garmon briefly considered giving up football for a career in
radio/broadcast.
</P>
<P>
   ``At that time, he thought his football career was over,'' said
Garmon's father, Henry, who lives in Haltom City. ``He was upset.
We encouraged him. We told him it was going to heal back up, and
he'd be ready to play, no problem. It wasn't a career-ending
injury.''
</P>
<P>
   It was a career-interrupting injury, however.
</P>
<P>
   Garmon had expected to be selected by the fourth round of the
NFL Draft. Instead, with no chance to work out for scouts and no
hope of playing football in 1999, Garmon was the 243rd of 253
players drafted last year.
</P>
<P>
   The Cowboys put him on injured reserve, where he spent last
season ``chilling'' and gaining weight. Garmon, whose playing
weight is 325-330 pounds, tipped the scales at 365 pounds.
</P>
<P>
   A committed off-season saw Garmon lose pounds and gain strength.
He now can bench-press 500 pounds.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's a hard worker, and he competes,'' Cowboys right guard
Jorge Diaz said. ``That's what you look for in young guys. He's got
a great future ahead of him.''
</P>
<P>
   Garmon, 23, is a first-year player in a rookie's body. Although
he has served his rookie initiation and no longer is required to be
at a veteran's beck and call, Garmon's NFL experience amounts to
21/2 weeks of training camp and the first quarter of an exhibition
game.
</P>
<P>
   Although he currently has a starting job, Garmon has no
guarantees.
</P>
<P>
   Garmon will start again Saturday night when the Cowboys play the
Atlanta Falcons in Tokyo, but Allen's fractured right hand is
healing. And right tackle Erik Williams could decide to play this
season, moving Solomon Page back to right guard. Five is a crowd at
offensive guard.
</P>
<P>
   ``Kelvin Garmon is a rookie who hasn't played for two years. He
is a work in progress,'' Cowboys coach Dave Campo said. ``...I
think at this point right now, again it's early and I don't want to
put pressure on him, but I think he's made a tremendous amount of
progress. He has really kind of figured it out. He has figured out
what it takes. I'm pleased with him. That's all I can say. I'm not
going overly crazy, because we've got some other players who can
play, but hopefully, he's going to make enough progress to provide
us some depth.''
</P>
<P>
   It might not be enough to give him a leg up on his training-camp
competition, but at least Garmon again is standing on his own two
feet.
</P>
<P>
   ``When people look at adversity, sometimes they say, `I could do
it, but I don't want to,' '' Garmon said. ``They say it's easy, but
a lot of people don't do it. When I set a goal, I try to accomplish
it. When things go bad, you don't give up on your dreams. You may
have to work a little bit harder to get back to where everybody
else is, but that's what life is.'' \Nsubheds:Team departs The
Cowboys departed for Japan yesterday afternoon for their game
against the Falcons on Saturday night. The Cowboys never have won a
game on foreign soil, going 0-6-1, including a 34-23 loss to the
Houston Oilers in Tokyo in 1992. \Nsubheds:Diaz holding a
reputation Jorge Diaz, who again will start at right guard
Saturday, led the league in holding penalties two seasons ago. Line
coach Hudson Houck said better technique _ having Diaz use his feet
more _ has cured Diaz's ``bad habit.''
</P>
<P>
   Diaz figures a change of uniforms can't hurt.
</P>
<P>
   ``I felt like they were always looking at me,'' said Diaz, who
spent the first four years of his career with Tampa Bay. ``Once you
get a reputation for leading the league in penalties, the refs are
going to target you. They're going to watch you closer than anybody
else. They're not going to let you get away with anything.
Hopefully, this might disguise me. You never know, maybe it's just
a jinx.''

<TEXT>
<P>
   Boxes are stacked all around Dennis Franchione's office, packed
up and ready for the trip to a new home in the John Justin Athletic
Center. TCU football, it seems, is moving up, in more ways than
one.
</P>
<P>
   The Frogs are leaving dusty old Daniel-Meyer Coliseum behind for
state-of-the-art facilities down the street. The past is left
behind. The future is golden.
</P>
<P>
   The metaphor is perfect, since the Frogs are also moving into
new digs in the national preseason polls these days, too. You can't
pick up a preseason football publication without finding TCU ranked
in somebody's top 25.
</P>
<P>
   Try it. There they'll be, sitting at No. 21 (the most recent
College Football Writers' poll) or No. 17 (coming in your
``Star-Telegram'' Monday) or even a feisty _ and perhaps slightly
overenthusiastic _ No. 11 in another area newspaper's rankings.
</P>
<P>
   This bandwagon is so overloaded, the tires may go flat before
the opening kickoff at the University of Nevada on Sept. 9.
</P>
<P>
   But standing by, Fix-A-Flat in hand, is Franchione. His days are
already hectic and overfull and the season opener is still more
than a month away. Yesterday he was the keynote speaker at the
Texas High School Coaches Association convention in Houston. By
1:30 p.m., he was back at work in the office he will leave behind
for good sometime in the next 24 hours.
</P>
<P>
   That's another interesting metaphor, by the way, but we'll get
back to that one later.
</P>
<P>
   Franchione, as even-keeled as ever, has taken TCU's sudden
notoriety in stride. Excited, yes; hysterical, no. Cautiously
optimistic, yes; starry-eyed, no.
</P>
<P>
   He understands perfectly that the Frogs are the current flavor
of the month. He also knows that could change faster than a snow
cone melts in August once the hitting starts for real.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's like I've told our players,'' Franchione said. ``All this
preseason publicity is based on what last year's team accomplished
and how many returning starters we have, but the 2000 team hasn't
done anything yet. The '99 team set the table for us to be
mentioned in this way.
</P>
<P>
   ``The truth is, we lost some pivotal guys and we have to replace
them. We still have a lot of work to do and some things to figure
out once fall camp gets under way.''
</P>
<P>
   Blah, blah, blah, blah. Coach-speak. That's not going to stem
the runaway optimism and Franchione knows that, just as he
understands why the major polls might favor the Frogs with their
first preseason ranking since the 1960 team opened at No. 11.
</P>
<P>
   ``They look and see you've got a Heisman Trophy candidate
\RLaDainian Tomlinson\S who led the nation in rushing, and then
you've got one of the 18 finalists for national defensive player of
the year \RDE Aaron Schobel\S,'' Franchione said. ``They see you've
got 10 offensive starters and eight defensive starters back off an
8-4 team.
</P>
<P>
   ``Then they look at the schedule and say, `Hey, these guys look
like they ought to be pretty good.' We have that potential if we
can stay healthy. But sometimes you're as vulnerable as a couple of
sprained ankles.''
</P>
<P>
   The positives to such a lofty preseason ranking are obvious.
Moving up in the polls is a lot easier if a team starts there
rather than trying to come from back in the pack. Team morale might
be at its highest ever. Ticket sales are up. Fans have been talking
about Tomlinson and TCU football all summer, an unheard-of
phenomenon in these parts.
</P>
<P>
   It's the flip side that worries Franchione.
</P>
<P>
   ``Obviously expectations are out of control,'' he said with a
nervous laugh. ``I haven't done a good job of managing those
things. People keep talking about us going 11-0 or something.
That's pretty difficult to do. Every year there are teams that try
to do that and very, very few that actually accomplish it.''
</P>
<P>
   But Franchione is smart enough not to poor-mouth his team
either. The Frogs just might be as good as people think. Or even
better.
</P>
<P>
   ``Last year, people put some expectations on us, too,'' he
pointed out. ``I was nervous about it, because those kids were
still somewhat fragile from the 1-10 team and we got off to a slow
start. Then we came back and won the last five games and hung in
there.
</P>
<P>
   ``In '98, we learned how to win. In '99 we learned how to live
with winning and expectations. This team, I think, is prepared for
all this.''
</P>
<P>
   The maturation process for the Frogs started with that 5-0 run
to end the '99 season, including the upset of East Carolina in the
Mobile Alabama Bowl.
</P>
<P>
   ``They've known since January or February, when the article came
out in ``The Sporting News'' \Rabout the possibility of the Frogs
going 11-0\S what people are thinking,'' Franchione said. ``Their
whole demeanor is different. We know we have to stay focused and
determined. We know there are no gimmes on our schedule. There's a
maturity there we haven't seen before.
</P>
<P>
   ``The best part is the players' attitude. It's like, `We can do
this. We've been there. We've been in these battles. We've beaten
good teams like the USCs and East Carolinas. We can do it again.'''
</P>
<P>
   In fact, there's not a game on the schedule the Frogs can't win,
but if you want to make Franchione cringe, just mention 11-0. Then
duck.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not my favorite topic, you understand,'' he said sourly.
``The worst thing we can do as players is talk about going 11-0.
Everyone hates to hear us say it, but we have to take it a day at a
time and a game at a time.''
</P>
<P>
   That's one coaching homily Franchione can forget to pack. As
true as it may be, at this stage of the game, nobody's buying it.
</P>
<P>
   The Frogs are moving into a new neighborhood. Keeping up with
the Joneses just got a lot harder.

C-USA COACHES RECEIVE TASTE OF INTERNET

<P>
   MEMPHIS, Tenn. _ Before meeting with reporters at yesterday's
Conference USA media gathering, the league's players and coaches
spent some time talking to 20 chairs in an empty room. Call it
Virtual Reality Interviewing.
</P>
<P>
   The comments of the coaches and players went live over the
Internet on the conference's Web site (www.c-usasports.com). Later
in the day, more sound and video clips were archived on the Web
site.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is the first time we've been able to do something like
this,'' C-USA assistant commissioner Brian Teter said. ``We're
using another element of technology to make things available for
our media and fans.''
</P>
<P>
   Despite the unusual aspect of speaking to an empty room, the
``virtual interviews'' were a hit.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not much of an Internet guy, but I think it's something
that will be good for the fans,'' Southern Mississippi coach Jeff
Bower said. ``But it was kinda tough talking to a bunch of
chairs.'' \Nsubheds:Briefly Southern Miss was a narrow winner in
preseason predictions by the league's coaches. The Golden Eagles
had five first-place votes and 76 total points. East Carolina, with
four first-place votes and 75 points, was picked to finish second.
Louisville was picked to finish third, followed by Memphis,
Alabama-Birmingham, Cincinnati, Houston, Tulane and Army.
</P>
<P>
   Heading into its fifth season, C-USA has four bowl tie-ins. The
league added the Motor City and the first-year Galleryfurniture.com
bowls to its existing roster of the Liberty and the Mobile Alabama.
``The bowls we're affiliated with now reflect our geography,''
C-USA commissioner Mike Slive said. ``Adding those two bowls to
bring us to four has worked out nicely.'' The nine-team league will
pull in a little more than $3.5 million in bowl revenue this
season.
</P>
<P>
   TCU joins C-USA next year, but the school had a presence at
yesterday's media meetings thanks to a stack of the school's
football guides.
</P>
<P>
   Alabama-Birmingham coach Watson Brown said he's one of the few
people who hasn't advised his brother, Texas coach Mack Brown, on
who to play at quarterback _ Major Applewhite or Chris Simms. ``I
did tell him this _ he can send either one of them to me,'' Watson
said. ``Doesn't matter which one, just pick one and send him to
Birmingham.''

ASBESTOS-RELATED DISEASE RISK NEGLIGIBLE TO HOME GARDENERS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By ANDREW SCHNEIDER  
 c.2000 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Commercial gardeners, nursery workers and others
who handle vermiculite on a regular basis could face a significant
risk of asbestos-related disease, but the risk for home gardeners
is negligible, according to a yet-to-be-released Environmental
Protection Agency study.
</P>
<P>
   The EPA plans to release a final version of the national study
of asbestos contamination of garden and packaging products within
10 days.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, the agency is conducting additional tests. But some
members of the vermiculite industry are already saying the EPA's
research is flawed.
</P>
<P>
   Investigators in Seattle and Washington, D.C., repeatedly tested
more than three dozen lawn products bought in 11 states during the
past five months.
</P>
<P>
   The initial round of tests found measurable levels of asbestos
in five brands of vermiculite. The remaining lawn products tested _
blends of soil, fertilizers and vermiculite _ were either free of
asbestos or contained only trace amounts.
</P>
<P>
   The intricate assessments of the risk of using
asbestos-contaminated vermiculite show that home gardeners who use
the product once a year for 30 years face a negligible risk of
contracting cancer from the asbestos. However, commercial
gardeners, nursery workers and people using bulk vermiculite on a
regular basis, also for 30 years, could face a greatly increased
cancer risk, depending on the material used.
</P>
<P>
   Preliminary assessment for the workers' group calculated a risk
that could mean as much as one additional cancer for every 100
workers using the tainted vermiculite.
</P>
<P>
   Although government agencies differ over what degree of
increased risk will trigger official action, most agree that
anything greater than one extra cancer per 1,000 people is serious.
</P>
<P>
   The EPA's concern over vermiculite surfaced in January when the
Seattle Post-Intelligencer, as part of its continuing examination
of the issue of asbestos regulation, had several
vermiculite-containing products analyzed. Asbestos was detected and
the results were given to the EPA's regional office.
</P>
<P>
   The regional office did its own tests, which also found asbestos
in the products.
</P>
<P>
   EPA's national headquarters then ordered additional surveys and
hired Versar Inc., a consulting firm the EPA used 15 years ago to
investigate vermiculite in consumer products, to conduct the new
tests.
</P>
<P>
   The final EPA report _ a combination of Region 10's and Versar's
work _ was expected in early July. But after a July 6 meeting at
agency headquarters with members of the vermiculite industry, the
EPA agreed to do more tests and risk assessment.
</P>
<P>
   The meeting included senior EPA officials; scientists from
Versar; officers of The Vermiculite Association (TVA);
representatives from The Scotts Co. and the Schundler Co., two of
the nation's largest producers of lawn and garden products; and
representatives of W.R. Grace &AMP; Co. and Virginia Vermiculite, who
run the country's two largest vermiculite mines.
</P>
<P>
   EPA officials gave the gathering a list of the products tested
and where they were bought.
</P>
<P>
   The group was not shy about expressing concern over EPA's
methods.
</P>
<P>
   ``Based on comments made at the meeting, TVA has grave concerns
that the planned Versar report of the testing may inappropriately
emphasize Versar's few findings of asbestos and thus be
misconstrued by the public,'' association President Michael Allen
wrote on July 18 to John Melone, director of the EPA's National
Program Chemical Division.
</P>
<P>
   Allen listed questions about 16 areas of the testing.
</P>
<P>
   The association was especially concerned over the EPA's
admission that the analytical results were ``mixed,'' says Charles
Simmons, a Washington lawyer who briefly was a spokesman for the
United Kingdom-based TVA.
</P>
<P>
   ``We interpreted this to mean that the agency is experiencing
substantial difficulty in identification and quantification'' of
the asbestos in the vermiculite, Simmons said, but acknowledged
that the EPA did not provide its complete test results.
</P>
<P>
   Details of the testing
</P>
<P>
   Discussions with those familiar with the testing and a review of
EPA documents obtained by the Post-Intelligencer indicate the
agency's scientists are having no problem identifying or
quantifying asbestos detected in the samples.
</P>
<P>
   Several methods of testing with increasing sensitivity _ all
long-accepted procedures _ were and are being used. But there was
inconsistency in some results.
</P>
<P>
   For example, examination of vermiculite from one sample would
detect no asbestos, but a subsequent analysis of another sample
from the same bag would find asbestos. Scientists say these
differences are partly a result of the non-homogeneous nature of
the products. The asbestos is a contaminant of some vermiculite
ore, and the hazardous fibers are not uniformly distributed in the
material.
</P>
<P>
   The level of asbestos in vermiculite will differ not only from
mine to mine, but also within the mines themselves.
</P>
<P>
   ``Human exposure to respirable asbestos is a very serious
concern,'' Simmons added, and cautioned: ``Asbestos is not expected
to be associated with all vermiculite.''
</P>
<P>
   The existence alone of asbestos in a product does not present a
serious health risk unless those fibers are inhaled or ingested. So
EPA investigators in Seattle and at Versar simulated how consumers
might use vermiculite.
</P>
<P>
   In a 10-foot-square, plastic-lined room in a Washington, D.C.,
suburb, scientists, wearing sensitive air filters, emulated how a
home gardener would likely use vermiculite. Asbestos fibers, in
some cases at relatively high levels, were found in microscopic
examination of the air filters.
</P>
<P>
   Although the EPA is the lead agency in this study, its findings
_ because they deal with products sold in the marketplace and the
health of workers using vermiculite _ would have to be acted upon
by the Consumer Product Safety Commission and the Occupational
Safety and Health Administration.
</P>
<P>
   Neither agency would publicly discuss its views on the testing
done thus far, but several people in OSHA and other sections of the
Department of Labor expressed concern at what they characterized as
a surprisingly high exposure threat to workers.
</P>
<P>
   The EPA's role in testing the products is authorized under the
Toxic Substances Control Act, which was passed by Congress in the
mid-'70s, said Stephen Johnson, EPA's deputy assistant
administrator for the Office of Prevention, Pesticides and Toxic
Substances.
</P>
<P>
   ``TSCA gives us broad authority to regulate chemicals such as
asbestos, lead and PCBs and so forth,'' Johnson said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We could mandate labeling. We could limit or restrict the use
of the material. We could ban the material from use. There are
provisions which allow us to initiate a civil suit for an imminent
hazard to deal with the situation.''
</P>
<P>
   But the EPA's actions and those of CPSC and OSHA will depend on
the level of asbestos documented in the final report, something he
declined to discuss.
</P>
<P>
   ``Generically,'' Johnson said, ``in the area of additional
cancer risks, our general benchmark for taking action is when we
start to see numbers that exceed one additional death per 100,000
to one in
</P>
<P>
   1 million. That's when we become somewhat concerned. If we start
to see numbers of one added death in 1,000 to one in 10,000 for the
general population, then those numbers are of real concern to us.''
</P>
<P>
   The debate over fibers
</P>
<P>
   Some in EPA and OSHA believe the industry's expected attack on
the reports will dust off the frequently used industry rebuttal:
The fibers were not asbestos, but only look like asbestos.
</P>
<P>
   The groundwork for this argument has been laid in a letter to
Melone dated July 14 from Virginia Vermiculite, which is owned by
Robert Sansom, a former EPA associate administrator and White House
staff member under Ronald Reagan.
</P>
<P>
   The 25-page package was to ``provide (Melone) with information
on `true asbestos' vs. `non-asbestiform' ... which can also exist
in a fiber-like form.''
</P>
<P>
   The letter also questioned a micro-photograph of a fiber handed
out in the July 6 meeting: ``This particle, according to the
experts that testified before OSHA, is not an asbestos-type
particle.''
</P>
<P>
   Asbestos is a generic term used to describe a number of
naturally occurring fibrous minerals, including chrysotile,
amosite, crocidolite, anthophyllite, actinolite and tremolite. All
have been proved to cause fatal diseases.
</P>
<P>
   The asbestos and stone industries have long and, for the most
part successfully, argued that six fibers regulated by the
government are the only true asbestos. Physicians who have treated
asbestos, vermiculite and talc miners and workers say if a fiber
looks like asbestos and kills like asbestos, the government ought
to regulate it.
</P>
<P>
   More than 37 million pounds of vermiculite are produced in the
United States each year from ore mined by Grace in South Carolina
and Virginia Vermiculite in Louisa, Va., according to the U.S.
Geological Survey.
</P>
<P>
   The ore is exfoliated _ heat-treated _ which causes it to
expand, popcornlike. There are 20 exfoliating plants in 13 states,
the USGS said, selling processed vermiculite to hundreds of
companies in scores of industries.
</P>
<P>
   In November, the P-I reported that vermiculite ore from a
now-closed mine owned by Grace in Libby, Mont., had caused
asbestos-related disease and deaths among miners and their families
for decades.
</P>
<P>
   That ore was sent to hundreds of exfoliating plants, where it
caused more fatal asbestos-related disease.
</P>
<P>
   The major uses of the product are in agricultural and
horticultural work, as well as insulation and construction.
</P>
<P>
   Thousands of workers _ ranging from those who use vermiculite as
a base for swimming pools, to plasterers, cement mixers and
insulation installers _ are exposed to far greater amounts of
vermiculite than horticultural workers.
</P>
<P>
   OSHA declined to comment publicly on the EPA report and what the
findings might mean to other vermiculite workers.
</P>
<P>
   When the EPA releases this study, it will be the fourth time in
20 years the agency reported on dangers of asbestos-contaminated
vermiculite to consumers and workers.
</P>
<P>
   Even though the first three investigations _ 1980, 1985 and 1991
_ documented significant risk of increased cancer from exposure to
the tainted feather-weight mineral, neither the EPA nor any other
government agency took action.
</P>
<P>
   These studies were among dozens of government reports done on
Libby vermiculite that the P-I reported last year were shelved and
ignored by the EPA.
</P>
<P>
   An EPA spokeswoman wouldn't comment on why no action has been
taken, saying the agency's inspector general is investigating.
</P>
<P>
   P-I reporter Carol Smith contributed to this story.

 PATRICK T. McGAHN JR., LAWYER FOR CASINOS, DIES AT 72  
 By IVER PETERSON    
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Patrick T. McGahn Jr., a colorful casino lawyer and South Jersey
Democratic Party leader who helped bring gambling to Atlantic City,
died Sunday in Somers Point, N.J. He was 72.
</P>
<P>
   He had suffered a stroke on Thursday, his family said.
</P>
<P>
   Until the 1979 statewide referendum that legalized gambling in
New Jersey, McGahn was famous mainly for his outsize personality
and for his devotion to the U.S. Marine Corps. As a young Marine
second lieutenant, he was awarded a Navy Cross and other
decorations in Korea.
</P>
<P>
   McGahn, Paddy to his friends, found his metier as a leader of
the campaign to bring casinos to the East Coast. He was a member of
the Committee to Rebuild Atlantic City, which was created to revive
the crumbling old resort town, and he went on to be local counsel
for the big casinos that moved east from Nevada once the gambling
referendum passed.
</P>
<P>
   McGahn's older brother, Joseph, a physician, was elected to the
State Senate in 1979, the same year the casino referendum passed. A
controversy involving the brothers exemplified the way McGahn could
roil the political waters.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. McGahn, who died earlier this year, held up a judicial
appointment sought by Gov. Brendan T. Byrne, a Democrat. The
nominee, Gerald Weinstein, accused Patrick McGahn of having his
brother bottle up the nomination and of demanding something in
return for releasing it. A resulting state investigation cleared
Patrick McGahn of charges of influence peddling but enmeshed the
agency in accusations that it was being used for political
purposes.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sometimes Paddy's style of politics was a little in-your-face,
and I didn't agree with all of his views,'' said State Sen. William
L. Gormley of Atlantic County, a Republican, ``but he was a
wonderful friend. He had the kind of personality that filled the
room.''
</P>
<P>
   Gormley was speaking on the floor of the Republican National
Convention in Philadelphia, where he was wearing the tie that
McGahn had brought him from a post-war trip to Korea. It was
emblazoned with elephants.
</P>
<P>
   McGahn, the son of an Atlantic City saloon keeper, was born in
1928 and attended local parochial schools before graduating from
Mount St. Mary's College in Emmitsburg, Md., with a bachelor's
degree.
</P>
<P>
   He is survived by his wife, Mercedes Walsh McGahn, four
children, six grandchildren and a great-grandchild.

GM WILL BUILD ENGINE PLANT IN BUFFALO AREA 
</HEADLINE>
   By JOSEPH P. FRIED   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   General Motors will build a $500 million high-tech engine
manufacturing plant at its complex in the Buffalo suburb of
Tonawanda, saving 600 well-paying jobs through the largest
private-sector investment in western New York state in many years,
Gov. George E. Pataki said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Had the company chosen to build the plant in another state or in
Canada or Mexico, something state officials said GM had been
considering, it would have been a major blow to the Buffalo area
because the 600 blue-collar jobs would have been phased out from
the Tonawanda complex's 3,800 existing jobs.
</P>
<P>
   As it is, the Buffalo metropolitan area's unemployment rate was
5 percent in June compared with a 4.3 percent rate statewide. And,
the Buffalo area has been adding jobs at a much slower rate than
the state has over all. In the 12-month period ending in June, the
number of jobs in the area increased by 2,300, or 0.4 percent, the
lowest job growth rate in any metropolitan area in the state. The
job increase rate statewide was 2.1 percent.
</P>
<P>
   ``The threat was very strong to move the 600 jobs,'' said
Charles A. Gargano, chairman of the Empire State Development Corp.,
in an interview. ``They said they were looking at different
locations.'' Among the other options, officials said, were the 10
other engine plants the company has in the United States, Canada
and Mexico.
</P>
<P>
   State and GM officials said the Tonawanda site was selected for
the plant partly because of what Gargano called the state's
incentive package, which included a commitment to spend $9 million
to upgrade streets around the site and water and sewage facilities.
They also cited an agreement permitting more flexible work rules
that GM reached with the union.
</P>
<P>
   The Tonawanda complex produces four-, six- and eight-cylinder
engines, and Gargano said that GM planned to phase out some of the
old production lines there. The plant to be added at the site is
intended to produce a six-cylinder, all aluminum, inline engine
that will be used in a wide variety of GM cars and light trucks.
</P>
<P>
   Construction of the new plant is to begin later this year, and
the plant is scheduled to begin operation in early 2003. Gargano
said the construction alone would provide 600 jobs in the building
trades.

LAZIO APPEARS ON CONTROVERSIAL TALK SHOW
</HEADLINE>
 By RANDAL C. ARCHIBOLD   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Rep. Rick Lazio returned to New York on Wednesday
from the Republican National Convention, and, among other stops,
appeared on the radio talk show of Bob Grant, who once drew
criticism for derogatory remarks about blacks and Hispanics.
</P>
<P>
   Lazio spent about 20 minutes chatting with Grant and a few of
his listeners on WWOR.
</P>
<P>
   Grant, a commentator for nearly 30 years, was fired from WABC in
1996 for what station managers said was an inappropriate remark
about the death in a plane crash of Ron Brown, the former commerce
secretary. Before that, he publicly feuded with New Jersey's
Republican governor, Christine Todd Whitman, in 1994. Once a
frequent guest, Whitman vowed never to appear again on his show
after a visit in which she objected to Grant's racially charged
rhetoric.
</P>
<P>
   He has toned down his commentary _ ``I got a bum rap,'' he said
on Wednesday _ and Lazio's appearance was uneventful.
</P>
<P>
   Lazio was asked friendly and routine questions about his Senate
campaign against Hillary Rodham Clinton, and he responded
cheerfully.
</P>
<P>
   At a news conference before the show, Lazio sought to draw a
contrast with Grant's past.
</P>
<P>
   ``I stand for inclusion,'' said Lazio, who appeared on the show
a few times before he entered the Senate race in May. ``I think my
record reflects that very, very clearly. Bringing people together,
finding common ground. I will be responsible for my remarks and
myself.''
</P>
<P>
   Lazio's aides said he had accepted Grant's invitation as part of
an effort to appear on a variety of television and radio shows.
``Rick does a lot of interviews,'' said Dan McLagan, his chief
spokesman. ``He has been interviewed on over 25 media outlets in
the last 36 hours, from CNN to America's Black Forum to MTV.''
</P>
<P>
   McLagan also noted that Lanny J. Davis, President Clinton's
former special counsel and a supporter of Clinton's candidacy,
appeared on the Grant show last week. Howard Wolfson, a spokesman
for Clinton, said Davis was not a paid adviser and only contacts
the campaign when he is planning to appear on a television show to
speak about Clinton's candidacy.
</P>
<P>
   Wolfson said Lazio should have skipped the show because of
Grant's past.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was willing to run with Pat Buchanan on the Independence
Party line to win votes. He is willing to go on Bob Grant to win
votes,'' Wolfson said. ``I'm beginning to wonder what he won't do
to win votes.''
</P>
<P>
   Lazio also appeared Wednesday on the O'Reilly Factor on the Fox
News Channel. In the first installment of a two-part interview that
concludes on Thursday, he answered questions on several topics,
including abortion. Lazio said he is pro-choice, but has been
criticized by Clinton for not supporting public financing of
abortions and opposing late-term procedures.
</P>
<P>
   In the interview, he suggested that life begins at conception.
``I believe there is a very special status when there is
conception,'' Lazio said, who added that he nevertheless believes
government should not make abortions illegal.

CHINA BLOCKS CHEN'S EFFORT TO COMPETE FOR U.S. 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Calif.)   By JERE LONGMAN with ELLIOTT DENMAN   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Eight years after she won the first Olympic race-walking
competition for women as a Chinese athlete, Yueling Chen hoped to
win another medal, this time as a U.S. citizen, at the 2000 Summer
Games in Sydney, Australia.
</P>
<P>
   However, China has protested her participation as an American,
and given the citizenship requirements of the Olympics, it appears
than Chen will have to watch the Sydney Games as a spectator.
</P>
<P>
   Chen, who competed for China as Chen Yueling but prefers the
Western listing of her name, obtained her U.S. citizenship on April
12. Last month in Sacramento, Calif., she finished second in the
20-kilometer (12.4-mile) walk at the U.S. Olympic track and field
trials, which conditionally qualified her for the Sydney Games in
September.
</P>
<P>
   However, an athlete who has competed in the Games for one
country must wait three years to compete for another country after
gaining citizenship in the new nation. This rule is meant to
prevent Olympic athletes from playing musical chairs with their
citizenship.
</P>
<P>
   A waiver can be granted, and frequently has been, but the
Chinese track-and-field federation has declined to issue one.
Tuesday, without explanation, the Chinese Olympic Committee
notified the U.S. Olympic Committee that it supported the Chinese
track federation's decision.
</P>
<P>
   The International Olympic Committee indicated Wednesday that it
would not get involved in this or other similar cases, saying it
was a matter for the Olympic committees of the United States and
China to decide.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't arbitrate these cases,'' said Franklin
Servan-Schreiber, an IOC spokesman.
</P>
<P>
   Barring IOC intervention, the case appears to be closed, said
Mike Moran, a spokesman for the USOC.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Earlier this year, even after U.S. Olympic officials traveled to
Havana to plead their case, Cuba denied to grant a waiver to Angel
Perez, a canoe-kayaker who had become a U.S. citizen.The IOC did
not intercede in that case.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think that's the end of it,'' Moran said Wednesday night.
``I don't think we have any wiggle room.''
</P>
<P>
   One senior IOC official, speaking on the condition of anonymity,
left some small opening, saying that China might be wise to
reconsider its position, considering that Beijing is bidding on the
2008 Summer Games and might not want to anger the United States.
Beijing lost by two votes to Sydney to become the host city of the
2000 Summer Games.
</P>
<P>
   ``It would be useful for the Chinese to approve that transfer,''
the IOC official said. ``America is a powerful country and can
always be helpful. People remember things like this. Good faith and
good form shown when things are delicate could make a difference.
Everything is important when you are bidding.''
</P>
<P>
   The Chinese and the U.S. Olympic committees enjoy cordial
relations, Moran said. Earlier this year, the Chinese granted
waivers for three athletes who had become U.S. citizens, two table
tennis players and a badminton player, he said. The difference is
that Chen has represented China in the Olympics and the others have
not, Moran said.
</P>
<P>
   Chen is the first Chinese woman to win a gold medal in track and
field, and is perhaps the most successful Chinese athlete ever to
attempt to compete for another country, which may explain China's
reluctance to grant her a waiver.
</P>
<P>
   ``She is clearly higher profile because of her past success,''
Moran said. ``That may be it.''
</P>
<P>
   Now living in Escondido, Calif., the 27-year-old Chen said that
China's refusal to let her compete for the United States was
``unbelievably unfair to me.''
</P>
<P>
   In a statement issued through her agent, Derek Boosey, Chen
recalled the words of the French baron, Pierre de Coubertin, who
founded the modern Olympics and said the most important thing was
to compete.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's all I want to do,'' Chen said. ``I just want to
compete.''
</P>
<P>
   Chinese Olympic officials could not be reached for comment.
</P>
<P>
   At the 1992 Summer Games in Barcelona, Spain, Chen won the
inaugural 10-kilometer (6.2-mile) walk for women in a controversial
decision after the Russian walker, Alina Ivanova, crossed the line
first, only to be disqualified for technical violations. Race
walkers must keep one foot on the ground at all times. Three years
earlier, Chen had set a world record in the 10-kilometer walk in 43
minutes 52.1 seconds. After she won in Barcelona in 44:52, a statue
of Chen was erected in her home town of Taeling, in Liaoning
province.
</P>
<P>
   In 1993, Chen immigrated to the United States, receiving a green
card as an alien with extraordinary ability, and Chinese athletic
officials did not protest the move, she said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had done all that I could for China,'' she said. ``I had won
a gold medal, and I no longer wished to compete.''
</P>
<P>
   She attended two universities in California and became fluent in
English. She changed her mind about competing and wanted to enter
the 20-kilometer walk, which is making its debut for women, in
Sydney.

APPRAISING THOSE EMPLOYEE APPRAISALS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DIANE STAFFORD  
 c. 1999 The Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Management guru Edward Deming once called performance appraisals
a deadly disease.
</P>
<P>
   Many employees _ and the supervisors assigned to write them _
agree.
</P>
<P>
   The annual employee evaluation, especially when tied to ``and
here's what your raise will be,'' is an atrocious practice.
</P>
<P>
   Here's why:
</P>
<P>
   - Many managers aren't properly trained in how to give
constructive feedback.
</P>
<P>
   - ``One size fits all'' appraisal forms make a mockery of
individual assessments.
</P>
<P>
   - It takes time to do appraisals well, and most managers are too
busy to devote that time.
</P>
<P>
   - Once a year is not enough to provide usable job improvement
guidance to a worker.
</P>
<P>
   - Appraisals are supposed to be self-improvement tools. Instead,
they're often interpreted as punishment and justification for tiny
raises.
</P>
<P>
   - Evals shouldn't be one-way communication. The best ones foster
dialogue.
</P>
<P>
   There are plenty of human resource specialists who sell
consulting services and products designed to stop the annual plague
of poorly done appraisals. Chief among their suggestions is the
360-degree, or multisource, assessment.
</P>
<P>
   The very mention, however well intentioned, makes some managers
sweat.
</P>
<P>
   If you think single-source appraisals are time-consuming and
badly done by overstressed, ill-trained supervisors, just think of
the ripple effect when a whole bunch of people _ supervisors, peers
and subordinates _ are asked to weigh in as well.
</P>
<P>
   According to current ``best practice'' thinking, 360-degree
evals are a better way to get a variety of informed opinions about
an individual's work and share good suggestions for improvement. In
some organizations, that happens.
</P>
<P>
   When done right, 360-degree appraisals reduce the chance of
one-on-one bias between a supervisor and his or her employee, and
give a fuller picture of a worker's contributions. When done right,
they give the worker a clearer understanding of his or her
strengths, weaknesses and the impression he or she makes on others.
</P>
<P>
   Those are admirable benefits. But in the real world, the
possible benefits aren't always achieved.
</P>
<P>
   Many appraisal forms aren't individualized enough to be
meaningful. Many don't even measure the sought-after things. Many
evaluators get no training in how to write good evals. And most
supervisors are too busy with their ``real'' jobs to devote
sufficient time and attention.
</P>
<P>
   In the ideal work world envisioned by Deming and a succession of
other appraisal experts, performance evaluations would be
individualized, forward-looking rather than historical,
career-building and supportive.
</P>
<P>
   In the real world, performance appraisals more often are hastily
scribbled tick marks on a page, done on deadline so raises can be
dished out on workers' employment anniversaries.
</P>
<P>
   In the real world, I once watched a lawyer doing his assigned
part to evaluate associates at his law firm. He was checking off
ratings on a pile of standardized appraisal forms _ and watching a
baseball game at the time.

ONCE AGAIN, PEREZ DEMOTED TO BULLPEN
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By BRIAN DOHN  
 c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   PITTSBURGH _ With manager Davey Johnson's future with the
Dodgers hinging on the final two months of the season, he made a
move Wednesday that signified only winning matters.
</P>
<P>
   Johnson, with the blessing of the front office, shifted
high-priced but ineffective lefty Carlos Perez to the bullpen.
Moving into a starter's role will be $200,000-a-year rookie Matt
Herges, who is 8-0 with a 3.00 ERA in a team-high 44 relief
outings. His first major-league start is Tuesday against the
Chicago Cubs.
</P>
<P>
   Perez is 4-6 with a 5.67 ERA, and the only thing that's kept him
in the rotation this long is his contract.
</P>
<P>
   Johnson's decision comes after Perez's second consecutive
abysmal outing against Pittsburgh on Tuesday, when he was pulled
after allowing five runs on nine hits in four innings.
</P>
<P>
   ``Carlos' outing earned him a trip to the 'pen,'' Johnson said.
``I'm not dealing with that anymore. (Herges) has been a big guy in
my pen, and he takes on a lot of different roles, and he performed
a lot of different roles long man, set-up, close.''
</P>
<P>
   After being pulled from Tuesday's start, team sources said Perez
trashed the clubhouse and got in a shouting match with Johnson.
</P>
<P>
   ``I tried to make this work for a lot of reasons,'' Johnson
said. ``I wanted him to be successful. That's my job. (Tuesday) was
kind of the capper for me. We made a commitment, and I wanted to
make it work. Regardless of contractual status, you want to get
value for that. You want to get performance for value.''
</P>
<P>
   Despite not winning since May 20 and posting a 16.71 ERA in his
last two starts, Perez wasn't happy about the move. But Johnson was
so fed up by Perez that he didn't bother telling the pitcher about
the move.
</P>
<P>
   ``He made a decision, so what can I say?'' Perez said. ``I'm not
OK. I'm not a reliever. I don't understand because it's two bad
starts. He made the move so fast. I wait five days to pitch and
then give up a few runs in the first couple of innings. I felt OK
(Tuesday). I don't know why he took me out.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've never been like this in my career, never pitched like
this. As soon as I get here, too many things change. I get tired
with too much (stuff). I don't understand because it's two bad
starts.''
</P>
<P>
   Herges, 30, has started in the minors, including 21 starts for
Triple-A Albuquerque last season.
</P>
<P>
   General manager Kevin Malone, who signed Perez to a three-year,
$15.6 million deal after the 1998 season, said it was a move that
had to be made for the Dodgers' push toward the playoffs. They
entered the day three games behind San Francisco in the National
League West.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a very logical move,'' Malone said. ``Everyone always
talks about the money. But, money aside, we want our players in the
best position to win. Davey will always be looking at the lineup
and juggling with who's hot and who's not. I think you'll always
see him juggling things.''
</P>
<P>
   Though Perez was miffed about his demotion, he was given many
chances. And he's also had his situation well-chronicled. It began
with a 2-10 record and a 7.43 ERA last season. Perez's status was
in question all winter, and that continued in spring training.
Perez was arrested and charged with driving under the influence
during spring training, then was sent to the minors after bombing
in his first start in Montreal.
</P>
<P>
   An injury to Kevin Brown allowed Perez to hang around, but the
Dodgers had to come up with innovative ways to keep him motivated.
Twice, they had him sign papers waiving his right to decline a
minor-league assignment despite having accrued five years of
major-league service time. The Dodgers also shipped Perez to the
bullpen earlier this season.
</P>
<P>
   Perez's argument is he left four starts with leads that the
bullpen blew, but the feeling in the clubhouse was supportive of
the switch.
</P>
<P>
   ``We can't afford to flip a coin and see which Carlos Perez
shows up now,'' second baseman Mark Grudzielanek said. ``It's
crunch time.'' &QL;

BOARD AT A MISSOURI UNIVERSITY VOIDS EX-PRESIDENT'S EXIT CONTRACT 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By OSCAR AVILA  
 c. 1999 The Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WARRENSBURG, Mo. _ Central Missouri State University's board of
governors said Wednesday that it had voided former president Ed
Elliott's controversial exit contract after failing to reach a
buyout agreement.
</P>
<P>
   The board would not provide details because the vote on Tuesday
involved a personnel decision and ``pending litigation.'' One board
member said a lawsuit from Elliott was possible.
</P>
<P>
   ``We made the best offer we could,'' said board member John
Dralus of Kansas City, part of the majority. ``It wasn't
acceptable, so we needed to look at what was in the best interests
of the university.''
</P>
<P>
   The state's attorney general and auditor had criticized the
lucrative consulting contract as an inappropriate ``golden
parachute.'' Some legislators wanted to cut the university's budget
in protest.
</P>
<P>
   Elliott's contract remains a divisive topic statewide and on the
campus in Warrensburg, about 55 miles southeast of Kansas City.
</P>
<P>
   Nickie Foster, president of the board of governors, described
her colleagues as ``polarized.'' The measure passed 4-3, with the
four newest members making up the majority.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm disappointed,'' said Foster, of Osage Beach. ``I feel like
we're losing a valuable asset.''
</P>
<P>
   Elliott and his attorney declined to comment Wednesday, as did
Andrew Carroll, the university's attorney.
</P>
<P>
   In May, the board voted to renegotiate the exit contract. Last
week, the board unanimously approved a buyout, but Elliott rejected
the proposal on Monday. He submitted a counteroffer that the board
did not accept.
</P>
<P>
   The board and Elliott agreed on a lump-sum payment of $225,000,
but Elliott's counteroffer sought to keep other benefits. For
example, Elliott wanted the option of buying a university-provided
car, while the university demanded the return of all property
within two weeks.
</P>
<P>
   As the negotiations continued, the tide of sentiment among some
in the public and on the board of governors had turned against
Elliott.
</P>
<P>
   The popular president announced his retirement in October 1998
after 14 years on the job. Two months later, the board approved a
professional services contract with Elliott, who officially stepped
down on Aug. 1, 1999.
</P>
<P>
   The contract paid Elliott $152,850 in salary and $180,969 in
benefits while he is on sabbatical leave until Oct. 31 of this
year. He was then to get a total of $287,590 in salary and benefits
over the next two years.
</P>
<P>
   Elliott also was to receive other benefits, such as the use of a
car, computers, a cell phone and other equipment. He and his wife,
Sandra, also received perks such as health benefits and tickets to
campus events, even though she was not a university employee.
</P>
<P>
   The three-year contract was worth $621,000 in salary and
benefits.
</P>
<P>
   The contract drew investigators from the state auditor's and
attorney general's offices. Board members later told the auditor
that the contract was justified because of Elliott's fund-raising
skills.
</P>
<P>
   Around the same time, Gov. Mel Carnahan appointed four new
members to the board of governors. That left only three members who
were part of the board when the original contract was approved.
</P>
<P>
   At the new board's first meeting in April, State Auditor Claire
McCaskill said the deal contained provisions not included in any
higher-education contract in state history.
</P>
<P>
   McCaskill was out of the state Wednesday but released a
statement through her office that said: ``The board did the right
thing. Ed Elliott was an outstanding president but his retirement
contract was way out of line, considering it was to be financed
with taxpayer dollars.''
</P>
<P>
   At the April meeting, the counsel to the state attorney general
told the board that precedent made it illegal to raise the salary
of an administrator during his term of service. Elliott's exit
contract could be voided because his original term still had one
year left, the counsel said.
</P>
<P>
   The board said it voided the contract based on that legal
judgment. The new members _ Robert Russell, E. Lenita Johnson,
Janet Sanders and Dralus _ voted to void. Foster, John Lenox and
Lynn Harmon opposed the measure.
</P>
<P>
   Attorney General Jay Nixon said the university board did the
``proper and responsible thing.'' His office has offered to assist
the board if Elliott sues to restore the exit contract.
</P>
<P>
   ``It would not surprise me if he sought redress from the
courts,'' Nixon said.
</P>
<P>
   The board's decision also found support among state legislators
who had railed against the contract during this year's session.
Rep. Martin Hohulin, a Lamar Republican, even proposed cutting the
university's budget to draw attention to Elliott's contract.
</P>
<P>
   Hohulin said Wednesday that he applauded the board's decision.
But he said universities needed to be more accountable so other
administrators would not receive similar ``sweetheart deals.'' He
said he expected legislators to push measures for greater state
oversight.
</P>
<P>
   ``As a legislator, I don't want to be in the university
administrative business,'' he said. ``On the other hand, I want to
make sure that tax dollars are spent wisely.''
</P>
<P>
   In her audit, McCaskill looked at all severance packages given
in the past five years to top administrators and coaches at
Missouri's four-year public colleges. She found problems in three
of 14 such contracts, but her sharpest criticism was aimed at
Central Missouri State's board of governors.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Harold Caskey, a Butler Democrat, had gone as far as filing
a bill to remove the Elliotts' names from the university's student
union.
</P>
<P>
   Caskey on Wednesday said he had no opinion on the board's vote
but thought the public scrutiny would have a positive effect on
other universities.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think all the criticism gave a heads-up to other
institutions,'' Caskey said. ``I hope they learned that they need
to be very mindful that they are spending taxpayer dollars.''

NEW LOOK EMERGES AS GOP CHANGES 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By KEVIN MURPHY and STEVE KRASKE  
 c. 1999 The Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHILADELPHIA _ The story of the Republican National Convention
that ends today is its bid _ through a cross-cultural array of
speakers, entertainers, ideas and promises _ to give a new look to
the Grand Old Party.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a historic convention'' for the Republicans, said Kansas
City native Hector V. Barreto before speaking to the delegates
Wednesday night.
</P>
<P>
   Barreto, a Los Angeles businessman and a campaign coordinator
for George W. Bush in California, said the party's commitment to
minorities is for real.
</P>
<P>
   Republicans say that commitment shows in their platform. The
preamble says ``we are the party that ended slavery'' and is home
to all Americans, ``particularly minorites and immigrants.''
</P>
<P>
   The platform further calls for more affordable public housing,
urban renewal, Social Security reform, low-income tax credits and
reduced taxes for the poor.
</P>
<P>
   Skeptics warn that the GOP must now follow through on its
platform commitments, and they don't believe the party's new look.
Except for the speakers, dancers and singers, they point out, the
convention's delegates are vastly white and largely wealthy.
</P>
<P>
   ``I really think the Republican convention is a masquerade ball
designed to conceal the real identity and special interest agenda
of the same old party,'' said Dagoberto Vega, spokesman for
Democrat Al Gore's campaign. ``This doesn't reflect the face of
America.''
</P>
<P>
   About 4 percent of the 2,066 convention delegates are black and
1 percent are Hispanic, according to an Associated Press survey.
Men make up 61 percent.
</P>
<P>
   The number of black delegates, about 80, is up from about 50
four years ago, surveys show.
</P>
<P>
   Democrats, who unlike Republicans have official goals for
minority participation, estimated Wednesday that 20 percent of the
delegates to its upcoming convention are black and 10 percent are
Hispanic. Half are women.
</P>
<P>
   ``We ask the state parties to make their delegations look as
much like America as possible,'' said Rick Hess, a Democratic
spokesman.
</P>
<P>
   Republicans, including party nominee George W. Bush, call
Democratic goals ``quotas.'' Critics say that stand, and the
party's opposition to affirmative action, are the main reasons to
doubt the party's attempt to build a new image.
</P>
<P>
   One of the key moments at the convention came Monday night when
retired Gen. Colin Powell challenged the party on affirmative
action. Delegates applauded his comments. But Bush, campaigning the
next day in West Virginia, sidestepped questions about Powell's
stand.
</P>
<P>
   ``I agree with Colin Powell that Republicans need to do more to
reach out to minorities,'' he said in an interview with Cox News.
``We've got a lot of work to do. And I agree with him that I'm the
man to do it for the Republican Party.''
</P>
<P>
   Karen Hughes, Bush's communications director, said Bush what he
calls ``affirmative access'' but opposes race-based quotas because
``he believes quotas divide and Balkanize our society.''
</P>
<P>
   Daryl Duwe, a spokesman for the Missouri Republican Party, said
the system the Democrats use in selecting convention delegates
isn't fair.
</P>
<P>
   ``That wouldn't guarantee that the most deserving people get to
go,'' Duwe said. ``Those who work hardest ought to go.''
</P>
<P>
   But former Kansas City Mayor Emanuel Cleaver says the
Republicans' drive for diversity is like a husband never bringing
his wife roses and then suddenly bringing her dozens of them when
he falls out of favor.
</P>
<P>
   ``They've probably overdone it to the point that it doesn't even
look or feel legitimate,'' said Cleaver, who was Kansas City's only
black mayor.
</P>
<P>
   Republicans acknowledge that changing the look of their
convention is not enough to win over minority voters.
</P>
<P>
   ``The party has to go beyond that,'' said Mark Parkinson who is
at the convention as chairman of the Kansas Republican Party. ``The
public is too sophisticated for there simply to be images not
followed up by action.''
</P>
<P>
   Barreto, who is a former Texan and is on the U.S. Hispanic
Chamber of Commmerce board of directors, said there is reason to
believe Bush could deliver on his pledge to help Hispanic and other
minorities.
</P>
<P>
   As Texas governor, Barreto said, Bush appointed Hispanics to
high offices such as secretary of state. Test scores of Hispanics
have risen during the Bush era, as have the number of
minority-owned businesses, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Bush received more than 40 percent of the Hispanic vote in his
re-election for governor in 1998. He got an estimated 27 percent of
the black vote, according to a survey by several news
organizations.
</P>
<P>
   Mike Barrera, president of the Hispanic Chamber of Commerce of
Greater Kansas City, said Bush's efforts to reach out to minorities
is a way to portray himself as a moderate with broad appeal.
</P>
<P>
   ``He is the first Republican nominee who does not kow-tow to the
right,'' said Barrera, adding he is not necessarily for Bush.
``It's not just the right thing to do, it's the prudent thing to
do.''
</P>
<P>
   Godwin OPara, a black Republican delegate from Wichita, said
Democrats should stop assuming they will get the votes of minority
voters and those voters should not assume Democrats are in their
corner.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Democrats take them for granted,'' the native Nigerian
said. ``They say, if they don't vote for us, who are they going to
vote for? Republicans?''
</P>
<P>
   Ron Freeman, who is not at the convention but is a black Kansas
City area resident and former Republican congressional candidate,
said Bush is opening the door to minority participation.
</P>
<P>
   ``It has to be disconcerting to Al Gore and the Democratic
party,'' Freeman said. ``We don't have to vote Democratic because
everyone before us has.''
</P>
<P>
   A poll CBS and The New York Times did July 20 found 84 percent
of black respondents planned to back Gore, compared to 6 percent
for Bush, with the rest uncommitted. A poll conducted by Knight
Ridder Newspapers last month gave Gore just a 50-34 percent lead
among decided Hispanic voters.
</P>
<P>
   While Bush has little chance of getting more overall minority
voters than Gore, modest success could decide a close election,
said Barbara Sinclair, political scientist at the University of
California-Los Angles.
</P>
<P>
   ``What they figure is, if they can cut into the near monolithic
Democratic support, that may be enough,'' Sinclair said.
</P>
<P>
   Doug Hattaway, another spokesman for Gore's campaign, said there
are plenty of holes in Bush's Texas record when it comes to looking
after the interests of minority voters.
</P>
<P>
   Hattaway said Bush has never visited the poorest border towns of
Texas, has opposed legislation to curtail hate crimes and has
backed tax breaks for the oil industry while rejecting better
health insurance for low-income families. ``The Republican
convention is an illusion of inclusion,'' Hattaway said.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. Rep. Harold Ford Jr., a Tennessee Democrat, said Bush and
the Republicans have to follow through on the good will they have
tried to create.
</P>
<P>
   ``Even Bush admits his party is not living up to all that it
intends to be,'' Ford said. ``I applaud him. I just hope we can
point to some tangible examples of them actually doing something.''

MAN CHARGED WITH FATALLY STABBING STUDENT IN BROOKLYN IN 1999 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Kan.)   (Editors: Antoinne, in 3rd graf, is cq.) 
By SHAILA K. DEWAN and WILLIAM K. RASHBAUM    
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ In a murder case that drew national attention but
seemed to be growing colder by the month, the police on Wednesday
charged a man with fatally stabbing Amy Watkins, a young graduate
student from Kansas, on a Brooklyn street a year and a half ago.
</P>
<P>
   The man, David Jamison, 27, admitted to his role in the killing
in a videotaped statement, a senior law enforcement official said.
Jamison had a history of petty crimes and drug violations, the
police said. He was arrested Wednesday morning at his home in the
Park Slope section of Brooklyn, mere blocks from where the stabbing
took place, and was later charged with first-degree murder, robbery
and possession of a weapon.
</P>
<P>
   Two other men, Pierre Antoinne, 26, an unemployed house painter,
and Felix Rodriguez, 21, a warehouse worker, were being questioned
by the police, relatives of the men said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   After the stabbing, on March 9, 1999, the police were left with
a highly publicized crime and few clues. There were no known
witnesses, and the killer had been careful to obscure any
fingerprints by wrapping the murder weapon, a six-inch kitchen
knife, in a white plastic bag before using it.
</P>
<P>
   More than six months after Watkins, who had moved to New York
from Kansas to attend the Hunter College Graduate School of Social
Work, was robbed and killed, investigators reported that despite
thousands of hours of work, their leads had dwindled to zero. Their
only hope was that the killer would turn himself in, commit another
crime in front of witnesses or tell someone about the stabbing. A
$10,000 reward went unclaimed.
</P>
<P>
   The police said hundreds of people had been questioned since the
killing, but Jamison's name had never come up. At various times,
the police theorized that the crime was committed by a homeless man
or a boyfriend of Watkins, according to a senior investigator.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, detectives got a break, an investigator said Wednesday:
a suspect in an unrelated case tried to trade information about the
stabbing for leniency. Jamison had told that suspect about the
attack on Watkins, the investigator said.
</P>
<P>
   News of Jamison's arrest came as a surprise to Watkins' friends
and family, many of whom said they had given up hope that the
killer would be found.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was as if it had all happened again,'' said Lawrence
Watkins, her father, a history teacher at the Dominican Academy in
Manhattan. ``What I'm feeling right now is that old wounds are
being reopened.''
</P>
<P>
   Adam Green, Watkins' boyfriend at the time of her death, said he
had moved out of the neighborhood where she was killed. He said he
had thought that the police would never find a suspect. ``A good
part of me hoped it would stay that way,'' he said. ``I was not in
need of a name and a face, because that wasn't going to change
anything for me.''
</P>
<P>
   Watkins, who was 26 when she was killed, grew up in Topeka,
Kan., and enrolled at the University of Kansas to become a painter.
But a year and a half into college, she switched her major from art
to social work.
</P>
<P>
   In its brutality and apparent randomness, her killing was the
kind of homicide that had become an increasing rarity in New York
City, with crime declining. For that reason, it drew national
attention and tabloid headlines. Watkins' dedication to helping
others, particularly women who were victims of violence, and the
shock that the killing sent through the gentrified area near
Prospect Park made the story even more compelling.
</P>
<P>
   On that cold March night, Watkins, described by one classmate as
``a soldier of social work,'' was on her way home from the Bronx
Community Center where she worked with battered women. Residents on
the quiet street heard two screams, and found her less than two
blocks from her apartment with a knife in her back, surrounded by
fallen groceries. Her purse was later found nearby.
</P>
<P>
   The police said their initial suspicion, that the motive was
robbery, was borne out Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   According to Jamison's statement, investigators said, he and the
two other men were in a neighborhood luncheonette when they saw
Watkins walk by and decided that she would be ``an easy mark.''
</P>
<P>
   Marie West, the sister of Pierre Antoinne, said the police told
her that they believed that Antoinne and Rodriguez were present
when Jamison is alleged to have killed Watkins.
</P>
<P>
   But West and two other relatives of the suspects who were
waiting in the lobby of a police station house Wednesday night said
the men had nothing to do with the murder.
</P>
<P>
   Veronica Corea, 25, Jamison's sister-in-law and Rodriguez's
sister, acknowledged that Jamison had been in trouble with the law
_ he has prior arrests for robbery, petty larceny and drug dealing
_ but she said he was not violent.
</P>
<P>
   West said her brother was not capable of murder.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's an idiot and a moron, but he wouldn't be able to do
that,'' she said. ``If you knew my brother, he's a real coward. He
doesn't have the heart to do that.''
</P>
<P>
   The police said Rodriguez was cooperating with investigators,
but Antoinne was not. Antoinne, a Haitian citizen, began serving a
state prison term for an attempted drug sale in 1995. On Jan. 25,
1996, state records indicate, he was paroled to the U.S.
Immigration and Naturalization Service. A police investigator said
Antoinne might have been deported to Haiti under a special program
and then returned, illegally, to the United States.

NEW LOOK EMERGES AS GOP CHANGES

<P>
   PHILADELPHIA _ The story of the Republican National Convention
that ends today is its bid _ through a cross-cultural array of
speakers, entertainers, ideas and promises _ to give a new look to
the Grand Old Party. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a historic convention'' for the Republicans, said Kansas
City native Hector V. Barreto before speaking to the delegates
Wednesday night. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Barreto, a Los Angeles businessman and a campaign coordinator
for George W. Bush in California, said the party's commitment to
minorities is for real. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Republicans say that commitment shows in their platform. The
preamble says ``we are the party that ended slavery'' and is home
to all Americans, ``particularly minorites and immigrants.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The platform further calls for more affordable public housing,
urban renewal, Social Security reform, low-income tax credits and
reduced taxes for the poor. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Skeptics warn that the GOP must now follow through on its
platform commitments, and they don't believe the party's new look.
Except for the speakers, dancers and singers, they point out, the
convention's delegates are vastly white and largely wealthy. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``I really think the Republican convention is a masquerade ball
designed to conceal the real identity and special interest agenda
of the same old party,'' said Dagoberto Vega, spokesman for
Democrat Al Gore's campaign. ``This doesn't reflect the face of
America.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   About 4 percent of the 2,066 convention delegates are black and
1 percent are Hispanic, according to an Associated Press survey.
Men make up 61 percent. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The number of black delegates, about 80, is up from about 50
four years ago, surveys show. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Democrats, who unlike Republicans have official goals for
minority participation, estimated Wednesday that 20 percent of the
delegates to its upcoming convention are black and 10 percent are
Hispanic. Half are women. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``We ask the state parties to make their delegations look as
much like America as possible,'' said Rick Hess, a Democratic
spokesman. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Republicans, including party nominee George W. Bush, call
Democratic goals ``quotas.'' Critics say that stand, and the
party's opposition to affirmative action, are the main reasons to
doubt the party's attempt to build a new image. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   One of the key moments at the convention came Monday night when
retired Gen. Colin Powell challenged the party on affirmative
action. Delegates applauded his comments. But Bush, campaigning the
next day in West Virginia, sidestepped questions about Powell's
stand. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``I agree with Colin Powell that Republicans need to do more to
reach out to minorities,'' he said in an interview with Cox News.
``We've got a lot of work to do. And I agree with him that I'm the
man to do it for the Republican Party.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Karen Hughes, Bush's communications director, said Bush what he
calls ``affirmative access'' but opposes race-based quotas because
``he believes quotas divide and Balkanize our society.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Daryl Duwe, a spokesman for the Missouri Republican Party, said
the system the Democrats use in selecting convention delegates
isn't fair. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``That wouldn't guarantee that the most deserving people get to
go,'' Duwe said. ``Those who work hardest ought to go.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   But former Kansas City Mayor Emanuel Cleaver says the
Republicans' drive for diversity is like a husband never bringing
his wife roses and then suddenly bringing her dozens of them when
he falls out of favor. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``They've probably overdone it to the point that it doesn't even
look or feel legitimate,'' said Cleaver, who was Kansas City's only
black mayor. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Republicans acknowledge that changing the look of their
convention is not enough to win over minority voters. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``The party has to go beyond that,'' said Mark Parkinson who is
at the convention as chairman of the Kansas Republican Party. ``The
public is too sophisticated for there simply to be images not
followed up by action.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Barreto, who is a former Texan and is on the U.S. Hispanic
Chamber of Commmerce board of directors, said there is reason to
believe Bush could deliver on his pledge to help Hispanic and other
minorities. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   As Texas governor, Barreto said, Bush appointed Hispanics to
high offices such as secretary of state. Test scores of Hispanics
have risen during the Bush era, as have the number of
minority-owned businesses, he said. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Bush received more than 40 percent of the Hispanic vote in his
re-election for governor in 1998. He got an estimated 27 percent of
the black vote, according to a survey by several news
organizations. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Mike Barrera, president of the Hispanic Chamber of Commerce of
Greater Kansas City, said Bush's efforts to reach out to minorities
is a way to portray himself as a moderate with broad appeal. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``He is the first Republican nominee who does not kow-tow to the
right,'' said Barrera, adding he is not necessarily for Bush.
``It's not just the right thing to do, it's the prudent thing to
do.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Godwin OPara, a black Republican delegate from Wichita, said
Democrats should stop assuming they will get the votes of minority
voters and those voters should not assume Democrats are in their
corner. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``The Democrats take them for granted,'' the native Nigerian
said. ``They say, if they don't vote for us, who are they going to
vote for? Republicans?'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Ron Freeman, who is not at the convention but is a black Kansas
City area resident and former Republican congressional candidate,
said Bush is opening the door to minority participation. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``It has to be disconcerting to Al Gore and the Democratic
party,'' Freeman said. ``We don't have to vote Democratic because
everyone before us has.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A poll CBS and The New York Times did July 20 found 84 percent
of black respondents planned to back Gore, compared to 6 percent
for Bush, with the rest uncommitted. A poll conducted by Knight
Ridder Newspapers last month gave Gore just a 50-34 percent lead
among decided Hispanic voters. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   While Bush has little chance of getting more overall minority
voters than Gore, modest success could decide a close election,
said Barbara Sinclair, political scientist at the University of
California-Los Angles. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``What they figure is, if they can cut into the near monolithic
Democratic support, that may be enough,'' Sinclair said. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Doug Hattaway, another spokesman for Gore's campaign, said there
are plenty of holes in Bush's Texas record when it comes to looking
after the interests of minority voters. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Hattaway said Bush has never visited the poorest border towns of
Texas, has opposed legislation to curtail hate crimes and has
backed tax breaks for the oil industry while rejecting better
health insurance for low-income families. ``The Republican
convention is an illusion of inclusion,'' Hattaway said. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   U.S. Rep. Harold Ford Jr., a Tennessee Democrat, said Bush and
the Republicans have to follow through on the good will they have
tried to create. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``Even Bush admits his party is not living up to all that it
intends to be,'' Ford said. ``I applaud him. I just hope we can
point to some tangible examples of them actually doing something.''

 PHILADELPHIA: a thousand attacks.'' 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Cheney's address capped Bush's night of triumph that had been
meticulously crafted for weeks, if not months. Even so, it was a
political and emotional peak for the two-term governor, former
baseball team owner and son of a former president who did not
rocket onto the public stage until he first won election as
governor in 1994.
</P>
<P>
   Just eight years ago, Republicans gathered in Houston to
nominate Bush's father for a second term _ only to have their
president ousted by Bill Clinton. But Wednesday night, Cheney
planned to stand before the 2,066 delegates to tell them that the
era of Clinton and Gore had been one of dashed hopes and squandered
opportunities.
</P>
<P>
   Cheney depicted Gore as intimately connected to an
administration that had been mired in scandal and was clearly
seeking to turn Gore's attacks on Bush's ``risky tax scheme'' back
against the vice president.
</P>
<P>
   ``In this election, they will speak endlessly of risk,'' Cheney
said. ``We will speak of progress. They will make accusations. We
will make proposals. They will feed fear. We will appeal to hope.
They will offer more lectures, and legalisms, and carefully worded
denials. We offer another way _ a better way _ and a stiff dose of
truth.''
</P>
<P>
   Cheney's comments were his harshest thus far against the
Democrats, and left no doubt that despite his mild-mannered
demeanor, the Bush campaign intends to employ him in the somewhat
traditional role of running mate as attacker. In his acceptance
speech four years ago as Bob Dole's No. 2, Jack Kemp was far more
restrained; he mentioned Clinton only once, and his sharpest words
were casting Democrats as ``elitist.''
</P>
<P>
   The speech by the vice presidential nominee is usually delivered
on the final night of the convention _ and is usually overshadowed
by the one delivered by the head of the ticket. But by giving
Cheney his own night, the campaign was able to showcase Bush's
running mate.
</P>
<P>
   And though Bush had planned the break with tradition well before
Cheney was chosen, the move offered the public an opportunity to
take a measure of a man who has been out of the public eye since
leaving the Pentagon eight years ago after playing a key role in
the Persian Gulf War.
</P>
<P>
   Cheney's speech provided delegates with yet another reason to
revel in a quadrennial gathering that has been remarkably devoid of
controversy _ in public at least.
</P>
<P>
   After his defeat to Clinton, former President George Bush had
been shunned at many Republican events. But this week, delegates
expressed supreme confidence that his son was their best hope to
retake the White House.
</P>
<P>
   Wednesday night was clearly the most festive of the week on the
convention-hall floor, as delegates tossed beach balls amid blaring
Motown music. The one somber note on the otherwise exuberant mood
was many delegates' preoccupation with the health of former
President Gerald Ford.
</P>
<P>
   Ford, who had delighted party loyalists on Tuesday night when he
appeared on the floor as part of a tribute to past Republican
presidents, was admitted to a hospital here Wednesday after
suffering at least one minor strokes.
</P>
<P>
   As he delivered the invocation, Steve Young, the former
quarterback for the San Francisco 49ers, asked a special blessing
for Ford's recovery.
</P>
<P>
   Cheney had been Ford's chief of staff at the White House. From
there, he was elected as a congressman from Wyoming, rising to the
rank of Republican whip.
</P>
<P>
   While acknowledging that Cheney's speech was the most hard-edged
of the convention, Bush's aides insisted that it did not violate
their pledge to keep the discourse from Philadelphia largely
high-minded and positive.
</P>
<P>
   ``The secretary's speech sets a new tone,'' said Ari Fleischer,
a spokesman for Bush. ``It draws contrasts with Vice President
Gore, but far more respectfully than typical politicians.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush has said to expect some barbs aimed at Gore. Yet some
passages in the speech veered closely to the personal _ especially
those that linked Gore to Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   ``As the man from Hope goes home to New York,'' Cheney said, ``
Gore tries to separate himself from his leader's shadow. But
somehow we will never see on without thinking of the other.''
</P>
<P>
   Then, he added, ``Does anyone, Republican or Democrat, seriously
believe that under Gore the next four years would be any different
from the last eight?''
</P>
<P>
   In the eight days since Bush named him as his running mate,
Cheney has found himself largely on the defensive, fighting off
attacks by Democrats that his voting record was too conservative
for most voters. They concentrated on his opposition to the Head
Start pre-school education program and his votes against a ban on
armor-piercing bullets.
</P>
<P>
   But in his speech Wednesday night, Cheney did not even allude to
the controversy _ or his own ideology _ and instead took the
opportunity to say glowing things about his former boss, then
President Bush, and about Bush's son.
</P>
<P>
   Governor Bush, who arrived in Philadelphia Wednesday after a
six-day tour through six states carried by Clinton and Gore in 1992
and 1996, took to the sprawling stage at the convention hall
Wednesday afternoon to run through his acceptance address for
Thursday night.
</P>
<P>
   Expressing, perhaps, Bush's disdain of long-winded addresses _
and perhaps his own self-assuredness _ his aides said that his
acceptance speech might be the shortest in years.
</P>
<P>
   Karen Hughes, the campaign's communications director, said that
Bush speech had been completed and that _ allowing for applause
lines _ it would last roughly 38 minutes. In contrast, acceptance
speeches by his father in 1992 and Bob Dole in 1996 each ran 57
minutes.
</P>
<P>
   Beyond the effort Wednesday night for Cheney to extoll Bush's
virtues, the program was intended as an opportunity for the party
to highlight its signature economic issue: tax cuts.
</P>
<P>
   But _ as throughout the convention _ the focus was on portraying
the party not as the party of plutocrats, as Democrats have long
sought to label it, but as a party of working people.
</P>
<P>
   ``Tax cuts matter to every American, especially the working
poor,'' Gov. James Gilmore of Virginia said in his prepared
remarks.
</P>
<P>
   To drive home the point, featured speakers included a Hispanic
small-business owner, Hector Barreto, who spoke of how Bush would
help entrepreneurs by reducing the burden of taxation and
regulation, and Kim Jennings, a single mother, who spoke about how
Bush's tax plan would help her edge toward the middle class.
</P>
<P>
   Democratic officials countered that the Republicans were trying
to distract attention from the fact that Bush's tax cut proposals
would disproportionately benefit the wealthy. And Gore's aides
pressed their case that both the Republican tax cuts passed this
year by Congress and those proposed by Bush would endanger the
nation's newfound fiscal health and the economy's long-term
prospects.
</P>
<P>
   The very theme of the evening, ``prosperity with a purpose,''
contained a tacit acknowledgment that the economy is hearty, a fact
that could ultimately be expected to help Gore.
</P>
<P>
   When Bush arrived at the airport here Thursday morning, he was
greeted with a red-carpet welcome, replete with a fife and drum
corps and a replica of the Liberty Bell which he gonged. Then he
was off to the Philadelphia Museum of Art for what was billed as a
Hispanic welcome event. Latin music blared.
</P>
<P>
   Bush was introduced by his Hispanic-American nephew, George P.
Bush, who said, ``Are you excited about electing a president who
represents the diversity of our society?''
</P>
<P>
   The governor and his wife, Laura, then appeared along with Sen.
John McCain and his wife, Cindy. Bush praised his one time bitter
foe _ who offered a tribute to him at the convention on Tuesday _
as a ``living example of duty, honor and country.''
</P>
<P>
   The two couples then stood with a batch of Latino children who
sang what was called a ``Spanglish'' version of America the
Beautiful.''
</P>
<P>
   From there, Bush was off to a Republican gala lunch that was
expected to raise $10 million for the party. A large, almost life
sized, backdrop of the White House viewed from the South Lawn was
beamed on the stage behind Bush.
</P>
<P>
   In his speech on Thursday, Bush said, he would ``share with
America how proud I am and how much I love my parents.'' He told
the crowd, ``I want to thank you from the bottom of my heart. If
all goes well, if all goes well, you're looking at the next
president of the United States. God bless you.''

APPRAISING THOSE EMPLOYEE APPRAISALS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DIANE STAFFORD  
 c. 1999 The Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Management guru Edward Deming once called performance appraisals
a deadly disease.
</P>
<P>
   Many employees _ and the supervisors assigned to write them _
agree.
</P>
<P>
   The annual employee evaluation, especially when tied to ``and
here's what your raise will be,'' is an atrocious practice.
</P>
<P>
   Here's why:
</P>
<P>
   - Many managers aren't properly trained in how to give
constructive feedback.
</P>
<P>
   - ``One size fits all'' appraisal forms make a mockery of
individual assessments.
</P>
<P>
   - It takes time to do appraisals well, and most managers are too
busy to devote that time.
</P>
<P>
   - Once a year is not enough to provide usable job improvement
guidance to a worker.
</P>
<P>
   - Appraisals are supposed to be self-improvement tools. Instead,
they're often interpreted as punishment and justification for tiny
raises.
</P>
<P>
   - Evals shouldn't be one-way communication. The best ones foster
dialogue.
</P>
<P>
   There are plenty of human resource specialists who sell
consulting services and products designed to stop the annual plague
of poorly done appraisals. Chief among their suggestions is the
360-degree, or multisource, assessment.
</P>
<P>
   The very mention, however well intentioned, makes some managers
sweat.
</P>
<P>
   If you think single-source appraisals are time-consuming and
badly done by overstressed, ill-trained supervisors, just think of
the ripple effect when a whole bunch of people _ supervisors, peers
and subordinates _ are asked to weigh in as well.
</P>
<P>
   According to current ``best practice'' thinking, 360-degree
evals are a better way to get a variety of informed opinions about
an individual's work and share good suggestions for improvement. In
some organizations, that happens.
</P>
<P>
   When done right, 360-degree appraisals reduce the chance of
one-on-one bias between a supervisor and his or her employee, and
give a fuller picture of a worker's contributions. When done right,
they give the worker a clearer understanding of his or her
strengths, weaknesses and the impression he or she makes on others.
</P>
<P>
   Those are admirable benefits. But in the real world, the
possible benefits aren't always achieved.
</P>
<P>
   Many appraisal forms aren't individualized enough to be
meaningful. Many don't even measure the sought-after things. Many
evaluators get no training in how to write good evals. And most
supervisors are too busy with their ``real'' jobs to devote
sufficient time and attention.
</P>
<P>
   In the ideal work world envisioned by Deming and a succession of
other appraisal experts, performance evaluations would be
individualized, forward-looking rather than historical,
career-building and supportive.
</P>
<P>
   In the real world, performance appraisals more often are hastily
scribbled tick marks on a page, done on deadline so raises can be
dished out on workers' employment anniversaries.
</P>
<P>
   In the real world, I once watched a lawyer doing his assigned
part to evaluate associates at his law firm. He was checking off
ratings on a pile of standardized appraisal forms _ and watching a
baseball game at the time.

 &HT;    Jordan abandons Georgia Senate bid
 &HT;    By Kathey Pruitt
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Airline entrepreneur Lewis Jordan, the self-proclaimed
``fresh face'' some national Republican leaders felt could be their
best chance for reclaiming a U.S. Senate seat in Georgia, abruptly
pulled out of the race Wednesday evening.
</P>
<P>
   Jordan's typewritten statement, issued nearly four hours after
the close of the first day of candidate qualifying for the seat of
the late Sen. Paul Coverdell, narrowed the contest to two top
contenders: Democratic former Gov. Zell Miller and Mack Mattingly,
a Republican who won the Senate seat nearly 20 years ago.
</P>
<P>
   Coverdell died two weeks ago of a brain hemorrhage. A Nov. 7
special election will fill the remaining four years of his term.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am personally honored to have been urged so strongly to
represent the people of Georgia in this important race,'' Jordan
said. ``However, in the interest of party unity and after careful
consideration of what I believe is in the best interest of my
family, I have chosen not to run.''
</P>
<P>
   He could not be reached for further comment.
</P>
<P>
   Georgia Republicans can now wage a three-month campaign without
splitting themselves between two major GOP candidates, which could
have given Miller_ appointed by Democratic Gov. Roy Barnes to
temporarily fill the post _ a clearer shot at winning the unexpired
term.
</P>
<P>
   Throughout the week, some top state GOP leaders attending the
party's national convention in Philadelphia warned against fielding
more than one Republican candidate.
</P>
<P>
   In the end, Jordan, a political novice, opted out. But the
decision likely will give the 56-year-old founder of ValuJet _ now
AirTran Airways _ the option for a future career in statewide
Republican politics, if he so choses.
</P>
<P>
   Reached Wednesday night in Philadephia, Georgia GOP chairman
Chuck Clay first heard of Jordan's decision from reporters. But he
praised Jordan's handling of the situation and said he was both ``a
little bit sad'' and ``relieved'' that Republicans apparently will
have one candidate _ Mattingly _ to rally around in the contest
against Miller.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've always said I prefer there be a single candidate; we look
stronger if we stay united,'' Clay said. But he also said the
decision not to qualify was totally Jordan's. ``I could 100 percent
support Lewis Jordan. I could 100 percent support Mack Mattingly.''
</P>
<P>
   At least one national Republican hasn't been as generous. U.S.
Sen. Mitch McConnell of Kentucky has said this week that Jordan
appeared to be the stronger candidate because the short,
three-month race ``is one of those occasions where you need a
candidate who can probably self-fund the race.'' McConnell, as
chairman of the National Republican Senatorial Committee, controls
substantial campaign purse strings.
</P>
<P>
   Jordan had told Georgia delegates

 &HT;    Cartoon museum can keep Mickey
 &HT;    By Bill Douthat
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. _ A judge saved Mickey Mouse from a sort
of museum prison Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Judge Walter Colbath ordered the earliest known drawings of the
world's most renowned rodent be left hanging in the International
Museum of Cartoon Art in Boca Raton. A bank seeking to foreclose on
a loan to the museum had sought custody of the 36 pencil-drawn
sketches. A plan for their transfer would have locked them away in
a special vault at the Norton Museum of Art in West Palm Beach, far
from public view.
</P>
<P>
   Cheers rang out when word of the judge's decision reached the
cartoon museum staff about noon. ``There have been plenty of
hoorays around the building,'' said museum operations director
Jeanne Greever. ``We are pleased, happy and relieved.''
</P>
<P>
   Greever said she's particularly pleased that the valuable
sketches will remain on public display rather than being stuck ``in
a dark closet.''
</P>
<P>
   Colbath said SunTrust's demand that the drawings be moved to a
vault at the Norton would be expensive and place the fragile
artwork at unnecessary risk.
</P>
<P>
   An art conservator estimated it would cost $3,600 to prepare the
36 sketches to be moved.
</P>
<P>
   SunTrust can put a sign next to the cartoon display noting to
the public that the bank is entitled to possession, the judge
ruled.
</P>
<P>
   ``That is what we had offered SunTrust two months ago,'' said
Nancy Colman, attorney for the museum. ``We are very excited with
the ruling.''
</P>
<P>
   It's not known if the bank will post a sign or appeal the
judge's decision. The bank's attorney, Lisa Hermann, did not return
phone calls Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Colbath last month granted SunTrust the right to possess the
drawings, but said the court would determine how the transfer of
custody would take place.
</P>
<P>
   The bank said it wanted the art work because the museum has
defaulted on its mortgage. The drawings, valued by the museum at
$3.7 million, were pledged as collateral for the loan.
</P>
<P>
   The museum owes $1.1 million on a $3 million mortgage it took
out in 1995.
</P>
<P>
   Boca Raton Councilwoman Susan Whelchel said she has had numerous
calls about whether the city should step in and help the embattled
museum. One way to help would be to place a city library there. The
problem would be parking.
</P>
<P>
   ``While we have this opportunity, I think it might behoove us to
talk about it at the (Aug. 21) council meeting,'' Whelchel said.
</P>
<P>
   The Mickey Mouse drawings appear on six storyboards with six
drawings and were created in 1927 for the animated film ``Plane
Crazy,'' a spoof of the mania with aviator Charles Lindbergh.
</P>
<P>
   Visitors to the cartoon museum in Mizner Park have increased
since the controversy over the mouse drawings, Greever said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everyone who comes in goes directly to them,'' she said.

 &HT;    Controversy brews over Stroh marker
 &HT;    By Tim O'Meilia
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. _ How much is a Stroh Brewery historic
site marker worth if it was once mounted on the Detroit brewery,
long since demolished, of a company that no longer makes beer?
</P>
<P>
   Maybe as much as $5,000, figures John McCarthy, one of the
owners of Adam &AMP; Eve Architectural Salvage, which sought bids on
the 5-foot tall aluminum marker on the online auction house eBay
during the weekend.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's not much interest here, but some bar owner in Detroit
would love to have this,'' McCarthy said.
</P>
<P>
   Stroh's had been a major brewer in the Midwest for 150 years,
since Bernhard Stroh emigrated from Germany and began selling his
own brew from a street cart. It says so on the marker.
</P>
<P>
   Michigan put the historic marker on the building in 1978.
</P>
<P>
   Now, how much is it worth if it's stolen property?
</P>
<P>
   ``It's the property of the state of Michigan,'' said Laura
Ashlee, a coordinator in the Michigan Historic Preservation Office.
It says as much in small print at the bottom of the inscription on
the marker.
</P>
<P>
   The Stroh family, now in the real estate business, didn't know
the marker was missing until they learned that Adam &AMP; Eve was
trying to sell it. When the brewery was demolished in 1985 or 1986,
the marker and other architectural artifacts were stored in a
company warehouse, said John Stroh III, president and CEO of the
company. The warehouse has been broken into several times, but no
one realized the marker was missing, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm sure this fella bought it legitimately from someone,''
Stroh said, but he still wants it back.
</P>
<P>
   Adam &AMP; Eve bought it last fall as part of an eclectic collection
of artifacts from the yard of former Ocean Ridge mansion owner
Philip Schwab _ a collection it paid $100,000 to salvage, the most
the West Palm Beach firm has ever paid.
</P>
<P>
   Schwab once owned a nationwide demolition firm but his firm went
into bankruptcy and his $6 million estate was sold in foreclosure.
</P>
<P>
   Schwab's firm did not demolish the Stroh brewery, Stroh said.
</P>
<P>
   McCarthy has removed the marker from the eBay auction _ no bids
were made during the four days it was offered.
</P>
<P>
   But he said, ``We're not just going to hand it over.''
</P>
<P>
   Said Michigan's Ashlee: ``When something says `property o'
right on it, you ought to have a little idea who it belongs to.''
</P>
<P>
   But McCarthy said he wants to see a police report or other
documentation that the marker was stolen.
</P>
<P>
   All he's received so far is several e-mails from a Michigan
State Enforcement Department agent threatening him with arrest.
</P>
<P>
   ``To have someone say we're going to take it away or you're
going to jail is not every nice,'' McCarthy said. ``They ought to
thank us for saving it.''
</P>
<P>
   Michigan isn't backing down either: ``We have no intention of
asking the taxpayers of Michigan to purchase property they already
own,'' Ashlee said.
</P>
<P>
   Stroh said, ``My strong preference is to work this out
amicably.''
</P>
<P>
   And where would the marker go if it were returned to Michigan?
Ashlee and Stroh said probably in front of the Stroh's real estate
offices, several blocks from where the old brewery stood.

PHILADELPHIA DIARY: A FUND-RAISER, A FAMILY REUNION AND THE ROCK 
</HEADLINE>
 
(Adds item at end about lost donation) 
ATTN: Conn., N.Y., Ga.  By ALEX KUCZYNSKI AND MATTHEW PURDY   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHILADELPHIA _ It is your decision, America.
</P>
<P>
   Dinner at Alain Ducasse for two might set you back $500, but
lunch with Gov. George W. Bush and 3,099 of his best friends on
Wednesday ran to at least twice that at the Pennsylvania Convention
Center.
</P>
<P>
   But who needs foie gras poached in pepper court bouillon when
you can get soggy Caesar salad and a glass of bathtub-warm pinot
grigio (if you were one of the lucky ones).
</P>
<P>
   Bush chose to make his public party debut on Wednesday at the
Republican convention's biggest fund-raiser, which seemed in step
with Wednesday night's convention message of ``prosperity with a
purpose.'' The lunch certainly added to the party's prosperity,
raking in $10 million, party officials said.
</P>
<P>
   Bush and his wife, Laura, attended; so did his brother, Gov. Jeb
Bush of Florida, and Dick Cheney.
</P>
<P>
   Bush's nephew, George P. Bush, the thinking woman's Ricky
Martin, showed up and flashed his extremely white teeth and spoke
heart-melting Spanish with one woman.
</P>
<P>
   The lunch had the feeling of any fund-raiser: rubber chicken, an
earnest children's chorus (to which no one listened) and lots of
schmoozing. But there was one big difference for most of the donors
at the lunch, at least according to the wife of a governor who
pleaded for anonymity.
</P>
<P>
   Safely ensconced in the ladies room, she peered excitedly into
her plastic goody bag, the donor's version of a child's birthday
party bag. The contents: a notepad with a Republican National
Committee logo, a T-shirt and a Kit-Kat bar.
</P>
<P>
   ``You would think for that much money, you'd at least get a
bottle of perfume,'' she complained.
</P>
<P>
   Prosperity, alas, has its limits.
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A Familiar Face Returns
</P>
<P>
   With his familiar mop-top and full face, he could have been Pete
Rose at an old-timer's game the way fans angled for autographs and
snap shots with yesterday's hero.
</P>
<P>
   Newt Gingrich may be out, but he's not down.
</P>
<P>
   He's a member of the convention's overcrowded chattering class,
yakking online, on radio, on television.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm back to where I was before I was speaker, walking around
spreading new ideas,'' Gingrich said.
</P>
<P>
   The recent Gingrich idea that got the most attention was
registering online (at Web sites for Macy's and Williams-Sonoma)
for gifts for his coming wedding. But Gingrich said he and his
soon-to-be third wife were simply doing ``what most modern couples
do.''
</P>
<P>
   The ideas that really excite him these days are about science
and technology. He's studying and writing about technology,
advising corporations on strategic planning and, this week,
providing commentary on Fox Television.
</P>
<P>
   Gingrich wasn't invited to the convention podium. First off, as
he says, ``the Republican Party hardly needs to build its strength
among white males.'' His brand of conservatism, even within the
Republican Party, often seemed as compassionate as a nail gun. And
since he used his 1996 convention speech to talk most memorably
about beach volleyball, apparently none of this convention's theme
nights seemed like a perfect fit.
</P>
<P>
   So what if he doesn't have a leading role in the convention he
calls the beginning of ``chapter four of the modern conservative
movement.''
</P>
<P>
   After all, the third chapter was entitled ``The Contract with
America,'' he said with a satisfied smile.
</P>
<P>
   Protests Falling Flat
</P>
<P>
   Pity the protester.
</P>
<P>
   The crowds weren't overwhelming. The convention flowed smoothly.
Philadelphia residents actually cheered when the police arrested
them. Phildelphia, so far, doesn't compare to the protests over
world trade issues in Seattle, or even in Washington, D.C.
</P>
<P>
   ``Seattle was like a 9, because they declared martial law,''
said Henry Schwab, 27, a self-described traveling activist.
``Philadelphia's like a 4. D.C. was like a 5.5.''
</P>
<P>
   A Hispanic Welcome
</P>
<P>
   One of Bush's first stops on Wednesday was the Philadelphia
Museum of Art for what was billed as a Hispanic welcome event.
Latin music blared. But while Hispanic children were up on the
stage and Hispanics up front, the crowd was filled with a sizable
contingent of blond, non-Hispanic, College Republicans waving
``Viva Bush'' signs.
</P>
<P>
   One of them, David Standness, 21, said he was part of a bunch of
College Republicans who came by bus from Minnesota.
</P>
<P>
   Bush was introduced by his Hispanic-American nephew, George P.,
who said, ``Are you excited about electing a president who
represents the diversity of our society?''
</P>
<P>
   A Family Reunion
</P>
<P>
   About 60 Bush family members _ all the siblings, the parents,
most or all of the siblings' kids _ planned an early dinner at the
Ritz Carlton. For the Bushes, national political conventions have
become family reunions. One campaign aide who is staying near the
family ay the Wyndham Hotel described the scene as ``very
exuberant, with lots of children running up and down the hall.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a lot of fun for the cousins,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The Rock Growls Back
</P>
<P>
   It ain't easy being mean.
</P>
<P>
   Dwayne Johnson, aka the Rock, introduced Dennis Hastert, the
speaker of the House, at Wednesday night's session. Why?
</P>
<P>
   It seemed appropriate that the World Wrestling Federation's most
celebrated wall of meat, Johnson, would introduce Hastert, who was
once a wrestling coach.
</P>
<P>
   Not everyone was happy about the invitation. As the Rock was
practicing his recitation on the convention floor (``Can you
s-m-e-l-l what the Rock is cooking?'' he wailed into the
microphone, flexing his shoulders so the seams on his white dinner
jacket swelled), L. Brent Bozell, the president of the Parents
Television Council, was steaming.
</P>
<P>
   ``This will hurt the Republicans in more ways than they can
possible imagine,'' Bozell said in a telephone interview. ``Any
time a Republican gives a speech about raunch or violence, the
bottom of the barrel stuff, people will be able to point to the
Rock, and his introduction of Hastert, and they will be able to say
that the Republicans sponsored and approved of and celebrated the
biggest superstar of raunch and violence. How vastly stupid can
they be?''
</P>
<P>
   On CNN, the Rock slammed back at Bozell, calling him ``an
extremist who represents a radical organization.'' And he stared
into the camera and chewed out Bozell. ``Grow up,'' he said. ``What
we do is entertainment.''
</P>
<P>
   A donation lost, then found
</P>
<P>
   Campaign money is flowing so heavily here that some of it
spilled right onto the ground.
</P>
<P>
   Brian Woodward, a reporter for The Philadelphia Inquirer, said
he found an envelope on the ground outside the convention hall on
Tuesday marked with the words ``$5,000 and Advo.'' Inside the
partly opened envelope he found a $5,000 check made out to ``McHugh
for Congress'' from the Advo political action committee.
</P>
<P>
   Advo Inc. is a direct-mail company in Connecticut, and Rep. John
M. McHugh, a Republican from Watertown, N.Y., is chairman of the
postal service subcommittee of the Government Reform Committee.
</P>
<P>
   Woodward, who found the envelope while walking to The Inquirer's
convention office, tracked down McHugh and gave him the check. ``He
was taken a little aback,'' Woodward said. ``He started talking
about how Advo tried to find lost children and that's their real
passion,'' referring to the company's direct-mail program aimed at
advertising missing children.
</P>
<P>
   Woodward said McHugh explained that he was expecting a check
from company representatives, but that they had apparently dropped
it.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not a lot of money in the scheme of things,'' Woodward
said. ``It's just a little glimpse of the stuff that's happening
here.''

UNUSUALLY RAINY SEASON RUINING VACATIONS FROM CAPE MAY TO CAPE
COD 
</HEADLINE>
   By MARIA NEWMAN with EDWARD WONG   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   POINT PLEASANT BEACH, N.J. _ For the first few soggy, gray days
of her family's two-week vacation that started here on Saturday,
Barbara Cagliostro had a simple question: Where is everyone?
</P>
<P>
   Cagliostro, who lives in Armonk, N.Y., said her family had been
coming here for eight years and had never seen it this empty.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were wondering, is it just the weather, or is it that
people don't want to come to the Jersey Shore anymore?''
</P>
<P>
   As many of her fellow vacationers could have told her, it's the
weather.
</P>
<P>
   From Cape May to Cape Cod, rainy, dank days have turned many
family vacations into waterlogged duds.
</P>
<P>
   On Wednesday, Cagliostro was resting on a blue vinyl lawn chair
on the deck of her seaside rental, enjoying the first truly sunny
day of her vacation. The day before, Jenkinson's Beach here was
closed because of the weather. Lifeguards were told to go home
early in the day because it was so overcast. As Cagliostro sunned
herself, her children sold hand-painted seashells to passers-by on
the boardwalk for a quarter apiece: ``Even their sales have been
down,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   It was not clear whether Wednesday's sunshine was just a respite
or a turn in the weather. Meteorologists said this July was the
coldest one on record in the New York metropolitan region, and one
of the wettest. And so far, August looks like it might start off
just as damp. Thunderstorms are predicted for Thursday in much of
the area, the National Weather Service said, although the weekend
could be clear.
</P>
<P>
   ``It should be a pleasant summer weekend,'' said Ingrid
Amberger, meteorologist with the National Weather Service in
Brookhaven, N.Y. She said the long-range forecast for August was
for normal rainfall.
</P>
<P>
   At Jenkinson's Beach and Pavilion, the weather has meant fewer
people in the amusement park, fewer crowds to watch the Elvis
impersonators parachuting out of planes, and miserable business for
local shops.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, while much of New England and Long Island has been
drenched, there has been more gray weather than rain here.
</P>
<P>
   Diana Szala of Robbinsville, N.J., in Mercer County, heard the
predictions of rain for Tuesday, but headed to Jenkinson's Beach
with her three nieces anyway. When they arrived, the water was
off-limits to swimmers, but she and her nieces could still sit on
the beach, which is all they wanted to do anyway. And the overcast
day brought a boon: they didn't have to pay the entry fee to get on
the beach, or the $6 for parking.
</P>
<P>
   ``If they had been charging, we wouldn't have come on the
beach,'' Szala said. ``What if we had paid $16.50 to get in, and
then in half an hour it rained? We figured if it was nice enough,
we'd just walk on the boardwalk. So we're lucky they're not
charging today.''
</P>
<P>
   People in other parts of the region have been coping with cabin
fever as their vacations were rained on.
</P>
<P>
   In Amagansett, on Long Island, the rain drove Janice Horowitz
and her husband, Richard Bookstaber, to stock up on arts and crafts
projects for their two children. The family began their two-week
summer rental, which they would only say cost them ``thousands,''
on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   On Monday, Bookstaber and his children went swimming in the
ocean despite a drizzle. The next day, they went to a bowling alley
that was so crowded the manager was taking reservations, Horowitz
said. She decided to go shopping in East Hampton, but found that
much of the village parking lot was flooded, forcing her to turn
back.
</P>
<P>
   On Martha's Vineyard in Massachusetts, which had a day and a
half of sun between July 16 and July 30, Jill Sacks and her family
from Westchester County, N.Y., have spent much of their time
watching water drip from the kitchen ceiling and mice scurrying
across the floors. The swimming pool _ the main reason why the
family was renting the house _ has overflowed twice.
</P>
<P>
   Sacks said the family had decided to forgo a trip to the
Mediterranean partly because they thought they would spend time in
the pool.
</P>
<P>
   ``It feels like September, or the end of August, when the
hurricanes come in,'' Sacks said Tuesday. ``It's driving rain, and
it's relentless.''
</P>
<P>
   On Wednesday, finally, the sun shone on Martha's Vineyard for a
few minutes in the morning.
</P>
<P>
   The weather has taken its toll on other outdoor activities. In
the Berkshires in Massachusetts, the renowned Tanglewood music
series has taken a hit because of the rains, said Caroline Smedvig,
a spokeswoman for the Boston Symphony Orchestra, which performs
every weekend in the series.
</P>
<P>
   The concerts usually draw their largest crowds, up to 15,000
people, on Sunday afternoons. But last Sunday, only about 5,100
tickets were sold _ 19 of those out on the lawn, Smedvig said.
</P>
<P>
   In Point Pleasant Beach, some families were taking the gloomy
weather in stride, partly because they could find other things to
occupy their time. Even with the ocean off limits to swimming,
there was the amusement park. Tuesday, children could go on all the
rides for one price of $10. There was also the Jenkinson's
Aquarium, or the arcades and miniature golf. For the grown-ups,
there was the Tiki Bar.
</P>
<P>
   Dave Korey, a police detective from Millstone, N.J., in Monmouth
County, has been checking the weather reports on his laptop
computer, in between going out to the beach with his wife, Karen,
and children Mikayla, 3, and Dave, 1.
</P>
<P>
   ``You've got to take the good days with the bad,'' Korey said.
</P>
<P>
   This is the second year the couple has rented a house on the
boardwalk for three weeks, and they came well prepared for whatever
nature threw at them. They made two trips from home to stock up
their three-week rental with enough videos and toys, such as a
children's pool, to keep their children busy, they said.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the clouds, it has been warm enough to go swimming,
Korey said. ``Yesterday they could have made a commercial out here,
or a picture for a postcard, because there was no one on the
beach,'' he said. ``It's been great.''

REPORTS OF WEST NILE ACCELERATING RAPIDLY
</HEADLINE>
 By ERIC LIPTON   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ The number of birds and mosquitoes testing positive
for West Nile virus in New York state is accelerating rapidly,
state health officials reported on Wednesday, a finding that is
inspiring yet more pesticide spraying in New York City, on Long
Island and in other areas.
</P>
<P>
   As of the end of July, the state had confirmed 67 infected birds
and 25 samples of mosquitoes that were carrying the virus. But in
just the last two days, those totals jumped to 115 birds and 38
samples of mosquitoes, state officials said.
</P>
<P>
   No human cases have been reported so far this year as a result
of the mosquito-borne virus. Last year, seven people in the New
York region died and 55 became seriously ill from West Nile virus.
</P>
<P>
   In New Jersey, the virus had been confirmed in 15 birds as of
July 31, and in Connecticut, it was confirmed in one bird in
Stamford on Monday, as in mosquitoes there earlier. And in
Massachusetts, officials last week reported their first infected
bird.
</P>
<P>
   Within New York state, the reach of the virus has also grown in
the last week, with a report for the first time this year that
infected birds had been found far from New York City, in Ulster
County and in the village of Liverpool, near Syracuse.
</P>
<P>
   The most intense evidence of the virus continues to surface in
the New York City area, especially on Staten Island.
</P>
<P>
   Mayor Rudolph Giuliani announced on Wednesday that health
officials had confirmed 15 additional infected birds, two in
Manhattan and 13 on Staten Island. This means that as of Wednesday,
the total number of infected birds found this year in New York City
had doubled to 32.
</P>
<P>
   The mayor announced said the the city would expand its pesticide
campaign. Given the finding of the infected bird in Central Park
and growing signs of resurgent mosquito populations there and in
Alley Pond Park in Queens, Giuliani also announced that the city
would respray the two parks, both of which were treated with
pesticides late last month.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Neal L. Cohen said that city officials were working
intensely to try to ensure that any human cases were identified. To
date, the city has ruled out 160 possible cases while it awaits
test results from some 40 people with West Nile-like symptoms.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are very, very actively looking,'' Dr. Cohen said.
</P>
<P>
   West Nile-related pesticide spraying has also taken place, or is
scheduled, in Liverpool and in Suffolk County, on eastern Long
Island, where officials reported on Wednesday that the virus had
been confirmed in 13 samples of infected mosquitoes collected on
July 17 and in 12 additional birds.
</P>
<P>
   In Suffolk, the infected mosquitoes appear to be concentrated in
Belmont Lake State Park in Babylon, which was sprayed with
pesticides the day after the infected mosquitoes were collected.
</P>
<P>
   John R. Bianchi, a spokesman for the National Audubon Society,
said he thought pesticide spraying had been excessive. The spraying
might present a risk to humans and wildlife, he said. City
officials have offered assurances that the treatments are safe.

TEEN IS ACCUSED OF RAPING 4-MONTH-OLD GIRL 
</HEADLINE>
   By ROBERT HANLEY    
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   HACKENSACK, N.J. _ A 4-month-old infant was raped in her baby
sitter's apartment in Passaic last week, and a teen-age relative of
the sitter's was ordered held on $200,000 bail Wednesday on charges
of aggravated sexual assault, the authorities said.
</P>
<P>
   The baby girl underwent surgery for genital injuries inflicted
during the assault, which occurred on July 24, and was hospitalized
for nearly a week, said Boris Moczula, first assistant prosecutor
in Passaic County.
</P>
<P>
   Moczula said county investigators were surprised at the age of
the girl when they first learned of the attack, and verified her
age at St. Joseph's Hospital in Paterson after the surgery. She is
thought to be the youngest victim of a sexual assault in Passaic
County history, he said.
</P>
<P>
   The suspect, Marios Patino Cabrera, 18, was arrested on July 27.
As he appeared in New Jersey Superior Court in Paterson on
Wednesday, detectives arrested the baby sitter and accused her of
giving investigators false information about the attack.
</P>
<P>
   ``Evidence suggests she knew an assault occurred,'' he said. The
baby sitter, Rosalba Rodriguez, 24, was charged with endangering
the welfare of a child for failing to seek medical help for the
baby and, later, lying to investigators, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Cabrera, who works in a clothing factory in Newark, is believed
to be a cousin of the baby sitter's husband and lives in their
apartment in Passaic with several other relatives of the couple.
Moczula said the residents, as well as the victim's family, were
illegal immigrants from Mexico. Rodriguez had served as the
infant's baby sitter since May, he said.
</P>
<P>
   The attack occurred about 11:30 a.m. on July 24, after the
baby's father had left her at Rodriguez's apartment before he went
to work, Moczula said. In midmorning, he said, Rodriguez placed the
baby on her bed to sleep. The assault is thought to have occurred
there, Moczula said.
</P>
<P>
   In early afternoon, the baby sitter called the infant's mother
at work and told her that the baby had bled while being given a
bath. The baby sitter said she thought the bleeding was caused by a
diaper that had been put on backward, Moczula said.
</P>
<P>
   The baby's mother examined her and found injuries to her
genitals. The baby was discharged from St. Joseph's Hospital last
weekend.

<P>
   PHILADELPHIA _ Burning to reclaim the White House after eight
years on the outside, the Republican Party nominated George Walker
Bush for president on Wednesday night and sent forth his running
mate with the most stinging and unabashedly partisan attack of the
convention.
</P>
<P>
   Dick Cheney, Bush's No. 2, asserted that the election of Al Gore
would perpetuate what he called the failed policies of President
Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are all a little weary of the Clinton-Gore routine,''
Cheney declared. ``But the wheel has turned.''
</P>
<P>
   Then, appropriating Gore's slogan from the 1992 campaign as his
own, he said, ``It is time for them to go!''
</P>
<P>
   In the ritual roll call, the 22 votes from Cheney's home state
of Wyoming cast at 10:04 p.m. gave Bush more than the 1,034 votes
needed for the nomination. As Latin music blared, the hall erupted
in a prolonged ovation as jubilant delegates, many of them dancing,
were awash in a sea of beach balls, confetti, balloons and banners
that proclaimed, ``Bush-Cheney.'' Former President Bush and his
wife, Barbara, jumped to their feet to join in.
</P>
<P>
   Cheney, a secretary of defense under President Bush before
becoming a business executive, said he was lured back into public
service because of his belief in George W. Bush and his fear that
Gore's election would perpetuate everything that he believed was
wrong with Clinton's stewardship.
</P>
<P>
   Drawing a contrast with Bush's achievements as governor of
Texas, Cheney contended that the Clinton administration had made no
headway on Social Security, taxes or military readiness.
</P>
<P>
   Casting aside the high-minded oratory that had marked this
convention until now, Cheney portrayed Gore as mean-spirited by
reviving former Sen. Bill Bradley's pungent dismissal of Gore just
six days before the crucial New Hampshire primary: ``A thousand
promises. A thousand attacks.''
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Cheney's address capped Bush's night of triumph that had been
meticulously crafted for weeks, if not months. Even so, it was a
political and emotional peak for the two-term governor, former
baseball team owner and son of a former president who did not
rocket onto the public stage until he first won election as
governor in 1994.
</P>
<P>
   Just eight years ago, Republicans gathered in Houston to
nominate Bush's father for a second term _ only to have their
president ousted by Bill Clinton. But Wednesday night, Cheney
planned to stand before the 2,066 delegates to tell them that the
era of Clinton and Gore had been one of dashed hopes and squandered
opportunities.
</P>
<P>
   Cheney depicted Gore as intimately connected to an
administration that had been mired in scandal and was clearly
seeking to turn Gore's attacks on Bush's ``risky tax scheme'' back
against the vice president.
</P>
<P>
   ``In this election, they will speak endlessly of risk,'' Cheney
said. ``We will speak of progress. They will make accusations. We
will make proposals. They will feed fear. We will appeal to hope.
They will offer more lectures, and legalisms, and carefully worded
denials. We offer another way _ a better way _ and a stiff dose of
truth.''
</P>
<P>
   Cheney's comments were his harshest thus far against the
Democrats, and left no doubt that despite his mild-mannered
demeanor, the Bush campaign intends to employ him in the somewhat
traditional role of running mate as attacker. In his acceptance
speech four years ago as Bob Dole's No. 2, Jack Kemp was far more
restrained; he mentioned Clinton only once, and his sharpest words
were casting Democrats as ``elitist.''
</P>
<P>
   The speech by the vice presidential nominee is usually delivered
on the final night of the convention _ and is usually overshadowed
by the one delivered by the head of the ticket. But by giving
Cheney his own night, the campaign was able to showcase Bush's
running mate.
</P>
<P>
   And though Bush had planned the break with tradition well before
Cheney was chosn, the move offered the public an opportunity to
take a measure of a man who has been out of the public eye since
leaving the Pentagon eight years ago after playing a key role in
the Persian Gulf War.
</P>
<P>
   Cheney's speech provided delegates with yet another reason to
revel in a quadrennial gathering that has been remarkably devoid of
controversy _ in public at least.
</P>
<P>
   After his defeat to Clinton, former President George Bush had
been shunned at many Republican events. But this week, delegates
expressed supreme confidence that his son was their best hope to
retake the White House.
</P>
<P>
   Wednesday night was clearly the most festive of the week on the
convention-hall floor, as delegates tossed beach balls amid blaring
Motown music. The one somber note on the otherwise exuberant mood
was many delegates' preoccupation with the health of former
President Gerald Ford.
</P>
<P>
   Ford, who had delighted party loyalists on Tuesday night when he
appeared on the floor as part of a tribute to past Republican
presidents, was admitted to a hospital here Wednesday after
suffering at least one minor strokes.
</P>
<P>
   As he delivered the invocation, Steve Young, the former
quarterback for the San Francisco 49ers, asked a special blessing
for Ford's recovery.
</P>
<P>
   Cheney had been Ford's chief of staff at the White House. From
there, he was elected as a congressman from Wyoming, rising to the
rank of Republican whip.
</P>
<P>
   While acknowledging that Cheney's speech was the most hard-edged
of the convention, Bush's aides insisted that it did not violate
their pledge to keep the discourse from Philadelphia largely
high-minded and positive.
</P>
<P>
   ``The secretary's speech sets a new tone,'' said Ari Fleischer,
a spokesman for Bush. ``It draws contrasts with Vice President
Gore, but far more respectfully than typical politicians.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush has said to expect some barbs aimed at Gore. Yet some
passages in the speech veered closely to the personal _ especially
those that linked Gore to Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   ``As the man from Hope goes home to New York,'' Cheney said, ``
Gore tries to separate himself from his leader's shadow. But
somehow we will never see on without thinking of the other.''
</P>
<P>
   Then, he added, ``Does anyone, Republican or Democrat, seriously
believe that under Gore the next four years would be any different
from the last eight?''
</P>
<P>
   In the eight days since Bush named him as his running mate,
Cheney has found himself largely on the defensive, fighting off
attacks by Democrats that his voting record was too conservative
for most voters. They concentrated on his opposition to the Head
Start pre-school education program and his votes against a ban on
armor-piercing bullets.
</P>
<P>
   But in his speech Wednesday night, Cheney did not even allude to
the controversy _ or his own ideology _ and instead took the
opportunity to say glowing things about his former boss, then
President Bush, and about Bush's son.
</P>
<P>
   Governor Bush, who arrived in Philadelphia Wednesday after a
six-day tour through six states carried by Clinton and Gore in 1992
and 1996, took to the sprawling stage at the convention hall
Wednesday afternoon to run through his acceptance address for
Thursday night.
</P>
<P>
   Expressing, perhaps, Bush's disdain of long-winded addresses _
and perhaps his own self-assuredness _ his aides said that his
acceptance speech might be the shortest in years.
</P>
<P>
   Karen Hughes, the campaign's communications director, said that
Bush speech had been completed and that _ allowing for applause
lines _ it would last roughly 38 minutes. In contrast, acceptance
speeches by his father in 1992 and Bob Dole in 1996 each ran 57
minutes.
</P>
<P>
   Beyond the effort Wednesday night for Cheney to extoll Bush's
virtues, the program was intended as an opportunity for the party
to highlight its signature economic issue: tax cuts.
</P>
<P>
   But _ as throughout the convention _ the focus was on portraying
the party not as the party of plutocrats, as Democrats have long
sought to label it, but as a party of working people.
</P>
<P>
   ``Tax cuts matter to every American, especially the working
poor,'' Gov. James Gilmore of Virginia said in his prepared
remarks.
</P>
<P>
   To drive home the point, featured speakers included a Hispanic
small-business owner, Hector Barreto, who spoke of how Bush would
help entrepreneurs by reducing the burden of taxation and
regulation, and Kim Jennings, a single mother, who spoke about how
Bush's tax plan would help her edge toward the middle class.
</P>
<P>
   Democratic officials countered that the Republicans were trying
to distract attention from the fact that Bush's tax cut proposals
would disproportionately benefit the wealthy. And Gore's aides
pressed their case that both the Republican tax cuts passed this
year by Congress and those proposed by Bush would endanger the
nation's newfound fiscal health and the economy's long-term
prospects.
</P>
<P>
   The very theme of the evening, ``prosperity with a purpose,''
contained a tacit acknowledgment that the economy is hearty, a fact
that could ultimately be expected to help Gore.
</P>
<P>
   When Bush arrived at the airport here Thursday morning, he was
greeted with a red-carpet welcome, replete with a fife and drum
corps and a replica of the Liberty Bell which he gonged. Then he
was off to the Philadelphia Museum of Art for what was billed as a
Hispanic welcome event. Latin music blared.
</P>
<P>
   Bush was introduced by his Hispanic-American nephew, George P.
Bush, who said, ``Are you excited about electing a president who
represents the diversity of our society?''
</P>
<P>
   The governor and his wife, Laura, then appeared along with Sen.
John McCain and his wife, Cindy. Bush praised his one time bitter
foe _ who offered a tribute to him at the convention on Tuesday _
as a ``living example of duty, honor and country.''
</P>
<P>
   The two couples then stood with a batch of Latino children who
sang what was called a ``Spanglish'' version of America the
Beautiful.''
</P>
<P>
   From there, Bush was off to a Republican gala lunch that was
expected to raise $10 million for the party. A large, almost life
sized, backdrop of the White House viewed from the South Lawn was
beamed on the stage behind Bush.
</P>
<P>
   In his speech on Thursday, Bush said, he would ``share with
America how proud I am and how much I love my parents.'' He told
the crowd, ``I want to thank you from the bottom of my heart. If
all goes well, if all goes well, you're looking at the next
president of the United States. God bless you.''

 &HT;    BUSH IS NOMINATED; CHENEY VOWS VICTORY
 &HT;    By KEN HERMAN

<TEXT>
<P>
   PHILADELPHIA _ George W. Bush, governor of Texas and scion of a
political family that includes a former president, on Wednesday
night officially claimed the Republican presidential nomination
that he won in March when he vanquished his last GOP foe.
</P>
<P>
   At 9:03 p.m. EDT, Wyoming cast its 22 ballots for Bush, putting
him over the 1,034 delegates he needed to clinch the nomination. A
four-minute celebration ensued, with delegates dancing amid
bouncing beach balls and sparkling confetti.
</P>
<P>
   Delegates also ratified Bush's choice of Dick Cheney, a former
Wyoming congressman, as their vice presidential nominee. Cheney
accepted and went right after the Democrats.
</P>
<P>
   ``What are we to make of the past eight years?'' he said, ``I
look at them and see opportunities squandered. The wheel has
turned. And it is time. It is time for them to go.''
</P>
<P>
   The final line echoed a chant led by Al Gore at the Democratic
National Convention in New York in 1992, when Bill Clinton won the
nomination. The Clinton-Gore ticket went on to defeat President
George Bush.
</P>
<P>
   Cheney, a longtime Washington insider who served as defense
secretary for President Bush, may not be the ideal symbol of
change. But he used his prime-time speech to tout Republican
strengths, particularly those of the man who will now lead the
ticket as he tries to avenge the 1992 loss.
</P>
<P>
   ``I see in our nominee the qualities of mind and spirit our
nation needs, and our history demands,'' Cheney said. ``Big changes
are coming to Washington. To serve with this man, in this cause, is
a chance I would not miss.''
</P>
<P>
   The biggest, and best change, Cheney said, would begin the
moment White House changes hands.
</P>
<P>
   ``These have been years of prosperity in our land, but little
purpose in the White House. Bill Clinton vowed not long ago to hold
on to power until the last hour of the last day. That is his right.
But, my friends, that last hour is coming. That last day is near,''
he said, drawing a loud ovation.
</P>
<P>
   He also joined in Bush's promise of a new tone in Washington.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the last eight years that city has often become a scene of
bitterness and ill will and partisan strife,'' Cheney said.
</P>
<P>
   Bush's nomination came on the third night of a ``rolling roll
call vote.'' Former President Bush and his wife, Barbara, joined
the celebration as their son secured the nomination, clapping to
the Latino music that filled the arena.
</P>
<P>
   Wednesday night's session began on a more somber note, though,
with Republicans offering their good wishes for former President
Gerald Ford, who was hospitalized after suffering one and possibly
two strokes. Doctors said Ford's prognosis was good.
</P>
<P>
   Bush, who will deliver his vision for the party in his
acceptance speech tonight, practiced his key line during a
Wednesday sound check on the massive stage.
</P>
<P>
   ``My fellow Americans,'' he said as applause welled up from
delegates and others in the First Union Center while the convention
was not in session, ``I accept your nomination.''
</P>
<P>
   Earlier Wednesday, Bush said he senses a nation hungry for his
brand of leadership and ready to reject Gore.
</P>
<P>
   ``Let me tell you what I am seeing and what I'm feeling. I'm
feeling Americans ready for change,'' Bush said at a Republican
National Committee fund-raising luncheon. ``They don't want four
more years of Clinton-Gore. They want somebody to appeal to our
better angels, not our darker impulses. And that's exactly what
Dick Cheney and I are going to give them.''
</P>
<P>
   At Gore headquarters in Nashville, the Democrats were ready with
an answer to Cheney's question about the past eight years, offering
a chart documenting the nation's recent prosperity.
</P>
<P>
   ``Cheney helped bring about the days of deficits, debt and
recession in the 1980s. He would help George W. Bush bring them
back,'' said Douglas Hattaway, spokesman for the Gore campaign.
</P>
<P>
   Bush is countering with a ``prosperity with a purpose'' message
that was Wednesday night's theme.
</P>
<P>
   Bush arrived in Philadelphia on Wednesday morning and went right
to work on his effort to change the party's demographics, starting
the day with a morning rally aimed at Latinos. Bush was introduced
by nephew George P. Bush, son of Florida Gov. Jeb Bush and his
Mexican-born wife, Columba.
</P>
<P>
   ``Are you guys excited about electing a president who represents
the diversity of our society, who we can count on to change the
Republican Party so that it starts to represent our views and our
faces and our diversity?'' George P. Bush asked the crowd, calling
his uncle ``somebody who represents our people, who represents our
culture.''
</P>
<P>
   The GOP presidential candidate's first words were in Spanish.
</P>
<P>
   ``Vamos a ganar,'' said Bush, prior to bringing former foe John
McCain and wife, Cindy, on stage.
</P>
<P>
   Bush, who is fluent in Spanish, was telling the crowd, ``We are
going to win.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Juntos podemos,'' Bush said. ``Together we can. Together, we
can make sure every child can read in America. Together, we can
make sure entrepreneurship spreads its wings. Together, we can make
sure el sueno americano es para todos que vivan en esta pais. And
junta podemos ganar en noviembre. Muchas gracias.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush's seamless transition into Spanglish told the crowd that
the ``American dream is possible for all those who live in this
country. And together we can win in November. Thank you very
much.''
</P>
<P>
   From the museum steps, Bush went to a far more traditionally
Republican setting, a luncheon gala sponsored by donors, including
lobbyists and corporate sponsors, who paid $1,000 to $250,000 to
enjoy New England crab cakes and Virginia custard.
</P>
<P>
   The event brought the party $10.1 million in unlimited,
unregulated soft money that the party will use to back Bush and
other GOP candidates. There were 109 companies and individuals
listed as co-chairmen, a title earned by giving or raising
$250,000.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know we ask and we ask and we ask again,'' Brad Freeman, a
California businessman and longtime Bush friend, told the audience
of 3,000 at the Pennsylvania Convention Center. ``But we do it all
because it is important.''
</P>
<P>
   Terry McAuliffe, the Democrats' top fund-raiser and convention
head, said the Republicans have been ``shameless'' in their pursuit
of money, particularly soft money, at the convention. The
Democratic National Committee will not raise soft money at its
convention in Los Angeles, which begins Aug. 14, McAuliffe said.
</P>
<P>
   The party will hold one fund-raiser during the Democratic
convention, headlined by Barbara Streisand and Whoopi Goldberg,
which is expected to raise $3 million to $4 million in hard money,
he said.
</P>
<P>
   Bush, the prime beneficiary of the GOP money, told the donors
their efforts will pay off.
</P>
<P>
   ``If all goes well, you're looking at the next president of the
United States,'' he said.

BUSH AND CHENEY NOMINATED TO LEAD GOP BACK TO WHITE HOUSE  
</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)   (EDs: Updates with quotes; pickup: Bush aides said.)   
 By STEWART M. POWELL   
 c.2000 Hearst Newspapers
<TEXT>
<P>
   &LR; PHILADELPHIA _ Republicans on Wednesday night formally
nominated George W. Bush to carry their hopes of regaining the
White House in the Nov. 7 election and roared with approval as vice
presidential nominee Dick Cheney hammered the Clinton-Gore
administration with sharply partisan rhetoric.
</P>
<P>
   Cheney, enthusiastically accepting the nomination as Bush's
running mate, quickly shed his legendary cool, telling cheering,
bell-ringing delegates that the Clinton-Gore administration had
``squandered'' opportunities amid prosperity, provided ``little
purpose'' to the White House and wearied the nation with the
``Clinton-Gore routine.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush, the two-term governor of Texas, watched the formalities
from his hotel suite surrounded by family members, including his
wife Laura, their twin 18-year-old daughters and his siblings _
including Florida Gov. Jeb Bush.
</P>
<P>
   Bush had taken the same stage at the 22,000-seat convention hall
only a few hours earlier to get familiar with the setting for his
own acceptance speech on Thursday night. Bush, saying his 38-minute
address was ``ready to go,'' tested the convention hall sound
system with a stentorian recitation of his most essential line:
``My fellow Americans, I accept your nomination.''
</P>
<P>
   The nominations cleared the way for the front-running campaign
to receive almost $68 million in federal funds.
</P>
<P>
   Republicans breathed a collective sigh of relief after word
spread that former President Gerald Ford, 87, was in stable
condition at the intensive care ward of a local hospital after
suffering one and possibly two small strokes. Ford had walked into
Philadelphia's Hahnemann University Hospital under his own power
with a briefcase in hand about 9 a.m. after suffering slurred
speech, dizziness and weakness in an arm Tuesday night. Dr. Robert
Schwartzman, chief of neurology at the hospital, said Ford was
expected to recover.
</P>
<P>
   Cheney's address to the GOP convention gave the 59-year-old
former Wyoming congressman a chance to reintroduce himself to
America after being thrown on the defensive by Democratic criticism
of his conservative voting record during 10 years in the House
before becoming President Bush's defense secretary in 1989. Cheney
named President Clinton or Vice President Al Gore at least nine
times in his remarks as part of the GOP strategy to hamstring their
misdeeds. Cheney never mentioned Clinton's sexual dalliance with
former White House intern Monica Lewinsky or the impeachment that
followed but referred to the scandal indirectly, saying that Bush,
``a man of principle, a man of honor'' would ``repair what has been
damaged.''
</P>
<P>
   Cheney stole a cherished campaign line used by Gore during the
Clinton-Gore campaign that unseated President Bush in 1992,
reciting Clinton-Gore missteps and repeatedly declaring, ``It's
time for them to go.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Big changes are coming to Washington,'' Cheney promised during
remarks that were crafted with the help of John McConnell, one of
George W. Bush's most experienced speech writers. ``On the first
hour of the first day, (Bush) will restore decency and integrity to
the Oval Office.''
</P>
<P>
   Cheney, recalling his decision to leave Washington and enter the
energy services industry with Dallas-based Halliburton Corp. in
1995, said that
</P>
<P>
   he had ``never expected to be in this position.'' But Cheney
said that he agreed to undertake his maiden national campaign at
Bush's side because ``to serve with this man in this cause is a
chance I would not miss.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush had announced his selection of Cheney in late July.
</P>
<P>
   Cheney addressed the Republicans on the 10th anniversary of the
Iraqi invasion of Kuwait that brought him to national attention as
a savvy wartime defense secretary during the Persian Gulf War. His
wife of 36 years, Lynn Cheney, introduced him as a ``fabulous
father,'' a patient fly fisherman and man who was rarely a
``chatterbox.'' Mrs. Cheney added: ``He will be a very, very good
vice president.''
</P>
<P>
   Karen Hughes, Bush's campaign spokeswoman, said the governor
hoped that Cheney's address would ``remind people that Secretary
Cheney is a statesman who brings a depth of experience to the
Republican ticket.'' Hughes said Cheney's congressional voting
record had been ``misrepresented'' by Democratic critics who were
quick to portray the ex-lawmaker as a conservative opposed to
abortion rights, the Head Start early education program, gun
control and strict environmental standards.
</P>
<P>
   Bush aides said they were buoyed by ongoing polling that showed
the Bush-Cheney ticket gaining strength against a ticket led by
Gore. A Voter.com-Battleground survey showed the Bush-Cheney ticket
widening its margin from 8 percentage points over the weekend to 13
percentage points in polling that ended Tuesday night.
</P>
<P>
   Bush led Gore 49 percent to 36 percent in a four-way match-up
that included Green Party candidate Ralph Nader, who had 4 percent,
and Reform Party contender Pat Buchanan who had 1 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Republicans' formal nomination of Bush and Cheney cleared the
way for their campaign to immediately receive $67.6 million in
federal funds to conduct their campaign through election day. Bush
receives the federal funds despite privately financing his primary
campaign with more than $80 million raised from donors in an
unprecedented financial juggernaut that left rivals, including Sen.
John McCain, R-Ariz., in the dust.
</P>
<P>
   Sharon Snyder, spokeswoman for the Federal Election Commission
in Washington, D.C., said the Bush-Cheney campaign could receive a
wire transfer of the federal funds from the U.S. Treasury as early
as Thursday, following approval by the six-member commission. The
GOP had already received $13.5 million to stage the convention.
``We're ready to go,'' Snyder said. &QC; 
Federal law provides the presidential candidates from the major
parties equal federal funding after their selection as nominees.
The law limits the candidates to spending that amount, although the
candidates also benefit from unlimited, unregulated so-called
soft-money spending by parties and political action groups on their
behalf.
</P>
<P>
   Bush, sweeping into Philadelphia from a five-state, five-day
barnstorming tour of swing states, rang a replica of the Liberty
Bell at the airport and quickly reached out to the nation's
influential Hispanic community by addressing a rally of Hispanic
Republicans in English and Spanish.
</P>
<P>
   Standing before a banner at the Philadelphia Museum of Art that
declared ``a new day'' in Spanish, Bush told several thousand
supporters gathered at the top of stone steps made famous in the
``Rocky'' series of movies that ``there's a better day for America;
there's a better day for all.'' Bush added in Spanish and English:
``Together we can win in November.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush also kept up the GOP's torrid pace of campaign fund raising
pace with an appearance at a $10 million luncheon gala that will
benefit the Republican National Committee's efforts to help both
the Bush-Cheney ticket and Republican candidates for the House and
Senate.
</P>
<P>
   Bush stood before a giant projection of the White House's South
Lawn that made it look as though he and Cheney were actually
standing on the lawn looking back toward the executive mansion that
has been inhabited since then-Arkansas Gov. Bill Clinton ousted
President Bush in 1992.
</P>
<P>
   Bush offered his cadre of well-heeled donors a ``report from the
field'' based upon triumphant visits since last Friday to Arkansas,
Missouri, Kentucky, Ohio and West Virginia. ``Let me tell you what
I'm seeing and what I'm feeling _ I'm feeling America is ready for
a change,'' Bush told his delighted audience. ``They don't want
four more years of Clinton-Gore. ... America is hungry for new
leadership and that is exactly what Dick Cheney and I are going to
give them.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush added: ``If all goes well _ if all goes well _ you're
looking at the next president of the United States.''
</P>
<P>
   GOP chairman Jim Nicholson told the Republican donors that he
had ``never seen a party more united and more resolved to win.''
</P>
<P>
   The violent protests that rocked Philadelphia on Tuesday,
leading to at least 350 arrests, sharply abated Wednesday, with
small platoons of protesters carrying out mostly peaceful
demonstrations.

DEBATE OVER SCIENCE STANDARDS IN KANSAS IS FAR FROM OVER 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By KATE BEEM  
 c. 1999 The Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   KANSAS CITY, Mo. _ Moderates who have regained control of the
Kansas Board of Education vow to reopen the debate over science
standards that play down the role of evolution.
</P>
<P>
   Come January, at least three moderate Republicans or their
Democratic challengers will join three other moderates on the
board, guaranteeing a shift back toward the philosophical middle
after the board's four-year lean to the right.
</P>
<P>
   And evolution, along with other issues from math to teacher
licensing, will make a comeback.
</P>
<P>
   Sue Gamble, who defeated incumbent Linda Holloway, said
Wednesday that she had discussed the future of the standards with
the two other moderate winners and the four board members who voted
against the standards.
</P>
<P>
   ``The voters have spoken,'' said moderate Bruce Wyatt, a Salina
lawyer who beat a conservative for the Republican nod in the 6th
District race.
</P>
<P>
   The 10-member board oversees the state's 304 school districts.
All members serve four-year terms, and half the members face voters
every two years.
</P>
<P>
   The storm over evolution broke a year ago, when the five
conservatives and one moderate voted to adopt science standards
that deleted references to the age of the Earth, the big-bang
theory of creation and some references to evolutionary theory.
</P>
<P>
   Proponents of the standards said they allowed local districts to
decide whether to teach evolution or another theory. But critics
said the decision set Kansas education back and was an
embarrassment.
</P>
<P>
   The conservatives have used their five-plus-one majority since
1998 but as early as next week could lose one of those crucial
votes.
</P>
<P>
   Wednesday night, a Republican committee in north-central Kansas
was to recommend a candidate to finish the term of former board
member Scott Hill, a conservative who moved from Abilene to Montana
earlier this year. The appointment would be made by Gov. Bill
Graves, who has allied himself with the moderates and endorsed
Wyatt in the primary.
</P>
<P>
   Saline County Republican leaders indicated earlier this summer
that they would like Graves to appoint the winner of the primary.
That's Wyatt, and should he be appointed, he could assume the seat
as early as Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Moderates are calling their near-sweep of the Republican state
board primaries a referendum on solid education, which they say
includes teaching evolution.
</P>
<P>
   What's more, moderates such as Gamble hope to broaden state
assessment tests and try to reclaim the school-to-work program,
which a deadlocked and leery board passed off to another Kansas
governmental agency.
</P>
<P>
   Kansas voters usually favor Republicans in the general election,
but should Democrats win these seats in November it woudn't matter,
predicted Val De Fever, a moderate state board member from
Independence.
</P>
<P>
   All the Democrats, including incumbent Bill Wagnon of Topeka,
have said they want to rescind the new science standards in favor
of those written by science teachers. Those standards would elevate
evolution to a concept unifying all scientific disciplines.
</P>
<P>
   In the November election, only one state board race should focus
on evolution.
</P>
<P>
   Incumbent conservative Steve Abrams of Arkansas City, who helped
write the controversial science standards, won his primary Tuesday
and will face Democrat Wayne Holt of Haysville.
</P>
<P>
   If Abrams wins, he will rejoin one other conservative _ John
Bacon of Olathe _ and a moderate, Harold Voth of Haven, who often
votes with the conservatives.
</P>
<P>
   Bacon said Wednesday that he did not doubt that moderates would
do as they say, but he said he wouldn't support changing the
standards again.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'll be there,'' Bacon said. ``And I'll be part of the
discussion.''
</P>
<P>
   Usually low-profile, this year's five state board races gained
national attention, thanks to the evolution decision. They were
featured on ABC's ``Nightline'' and the ``CBS Evening News,'' among
other programs. Three times in the last year the evolution issue
made the front page of The New York Times.
</P>
<P>
   Nationally, the race between Holloway and Gamble came to
symbolize the issue. Holloway was the board's mouthpiece after the
board's August 1999 vote, when national and international media
descended on Kansas.
</P>
<P>
   After conceding defeat Tuesday night, Holloway said she and
other conservatives had taken a stand for academic freedom, for
allowing more than one theory of life's origins to be taught in
science classes, and so launched an idea that can't be stopped.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think the dogma will stand,'' she said. ``Too many
people have had a chance to think about this (evolution).''
</P>
<P>
   And that's not such a bad thing, said the Rev. Barry Lynn of
Americans United for Separation of Church and State, which
disagreed with the board's decision a year ago. Reopening the
discussion allows science to rebut what Lynn called false
information put out by creationists.
</P>
<P>
   ``When people realize what the nature of general science is,
they reject that far-right view and adopt a sensible middle
ground,'' Lynn said.

N.J.'S MCGREEVEY TIPS HAT TO SUPPORTERS, INCLUDING DEMOCRATS FROM
16 COUNTIES 
</HEADLINE>
   By RONALD SMOTHERS   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   TRENTON, N.J. _ Having outrun an attempt by Sen. Robert
Torricelli to sprint past him toward the Democratic nomination for
New Jersey governor, Mayor James McGreevey of Woodbridge took a
symbolic victory lap Wednesday at a news conference in Trenton,
showing off the state and county party leaders who have rallied to
his side.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is what unity looks like,'' McGreevey said as he stood
among a group of 50 party leaders and lawmakers who he said
represented both South and North Jersey, as well as cities and
suburbs. It included Democratic leaders from 16 of 21 counties and
many of the party's state legislators.
</P>
<P>
   The leaders were assembled by the state party chairman, Thomas
Giblin, who said that without Torricelli's potentially divisive
efforts for the nomination, the party would be stronger.
</P>
<P>
   McGreevey, who was the party's nominee in 1997 and lost by a
narrow margin to Gov. Christie Whitman, had been moving without
competition toward the 2001 nomination until a few weeks ago, when
Torricelli began an effort to line up Democratic leaders behind his
potential candidacy. But over the weekend, McGreevey secured the
crucial endorsements of leaders in populous Essex County. On
Monday, Torricelli announced he would not run for governor.
</P>
<P>
   Torricelli has refused to offer an endorsement for McGreevey,
and mentioned two other Democrats he said might seek the
nomination: Reps. Bill Pascrell of Paterson and Frank Pallone Jr.
of Long Branch. Pallone confirmed Wednesday that he was considering
a run for the nomination.
</P>
<P>
   But Brad Lawrence, a spokesman for the McGreevey campaign, said
it would be hard to mount a challenge with just the potential
backing of leaders in the five counties not represented in
Wednesday's show of support. Those counties are Camden, Monmouth,
Morris, Passaic and Burlington.
</P>
<P>
   Wednesday, McGreevey was gracious and stopped short of saying
that he had replaced Torricelli as the ``the 800-pound gorilla'' of
state Democratic politics, adding, ``I have the gray hairs to prove
it.''
</P>
<P>
   Among the leaders at Wednesday's event was Joseph Ferriero,
Democratic chairman in Bergen County, the state's most populous and
Torricelli's home county. Earlier in the week, Ferriero was in a
quandary, unwilling to oppose a favorite son but still strongly
attracted to the candidacy of McGreevey. When Mayor Sharpe James of
Newark held a news conference with other Essex County Democrats on
Monday to support McGreevey, Ferriero was in the audience.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was there to show my support for McGreevey,'' he said of his
nervous wait on the sidelines. ``But if Bob Torricelli was a
candidate, I would have to support him because he is our local
senator. But today, with Bob not in the race, I'm free.''
</P>
<P>
   Lawrence, of the McGreevey campaign, said that in contrast to
the frantic pace of the last two weeks, McGreevey would use the
more leisurely atmosphere of the coming months _ when the
presidential and senatorial campaigns take center stage _ to bring
other Democratic leaders into the fold.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is still some hard work needed to heal,'' Lawrence said,
``but today is the beginning.''

<TEXT>
<P>
   PHILADELPHIA _ Burning to reclaim the White House after eight
years on the outside, the Republican Party nominated George Walker
Bush for president on Wednesday night and sent forth his running
mate with the most stinging and unabashedly partisan attack of the
convention.
</P>
<P>
   Dick Cheney, Bush's No. 2, asserted that the election of Al Gore
would perpetuate what he called the failed policies of President
Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are all a little weary of the Clinton-Gore routine,''
Cheney declared. ``But the wheel has turned.''
</P>
<P>
   Then, appropriating Gore's slogan from the 1992 campaign as his
own, he said, ``It is time for them to go!''
</P>
<P>
   In the ritual roll call, the 22 votes from Cheney's home state
of Wyoming cast at 10:04 p.m. gave Bush more than the 1,034 votes
needed for the nomination. As Latin music blared, the hall erupted
in a prolonged ovation as jubilant delegates, many of them dancing,
were awash in a sea of beach balls, confetti, balloons and banners
that proclaimed, ``Bush-Cheney.'' Former President Bush and his
wife, Barbara, jumped to their feet to join in.
</P>
<P>
   Cheney, a secretary of defense under President Bush before
becoming a business executive, said he was lured back into public
service because of his belief in George W. Bush and his fear that
Gore's election would perpetuate everything that he believed was
wrong with Clinton's stewardship.
</P>
<P>
   Drawing a contrast with Bush's achievements as governor of
Texas, Cheney contended that the Clinton administration had made no
headway on Social Security, taxes or military readiness.
</P>
<P>
   Casting aside the high-minded oratory that had marked this
convention until now, Cheney portrayed Gore as mean-spirited by
reviving former Sen. Bill Bradley's pungent dismissal of Gore just
six days before the crucial New Hampshire primary: ``A thousand
promises. A thousand attacks.''
</P>
<P>
   Cheney's address capped Bush's night of triumph that had been
meticulously crafted for weeks, if not months. Even so, it was a
political and emotional peak for the two-term governor, former
baseball team owner and son of a former president who did not
rocket onto the public stage until he first won election as
governor in 1994.
</P>
<P>
   Just eight years ago, Republicans gathered in Houston to
nominate Bush's father for a second term _ only to have their
president ousted by Bill Clinton. But Wednesday night, after being
introduced by his wife, Lynne, Cheney stood before the 2,066
delegates and told them that the era of Clinton and Gore had been
one of dashed hopes and squandered opportunities.
</P>
<P>
   Cheney depicted Gore as intimately connected to an
administration that had been mired in scandal and was clearly
seeking to turn Gore's attacks on Bush's ``risky tax scheme'' back
against the vice president.
</P>
<P>
   ``In this election, they will speak endlessly of risk,'' Cheney
said. ``We will speak of progress. They will make accusations. We
will make proposals. They will feed fear. We will appeal to hope.
They will offer more lectures, and legalisms, and carefully worded
denials. We offer another way _ a better way _ and a stiff dose of
truth.''
</P>
<P>
   Cheney's comments were his harshest thus far against the
Democrats, and left no doubt that despite his mild-mannered
demeanor, the Bush campaign intends to employ him in the somewhat
traditional role of running mate as attacker. In his acceptance
speech four years ago as Bob Dole's No. 2, Jack Kemp was far more
restrained; he mentioned Clinton only once, and his sharpest words
were casting Democrats as ``elitist.''
</P>
<P>
   The speech by the vice presidential nominee is usually delivered
on the final night of the convention _ and is usually overshadowed
by the one delivered by the head of the ticket. But by giving
Cheney his own night, the campaign was able to showcase Bush's
running mate.
</P>
<P>
   And though Bush had planned the break with tradition well before
Cheney was chosen, the move offered the public an opportunity to
take a measure of a man who has been out of the public eye since
leaving the Pentagon eight years ago after playing a key role in
the Persian Gulf War.
</P>
<P>
   Cheney's speech provided delegates with yet another reason to
revel in a quadrennial gathering that has been remarkably devoid of
controversy _ in public at least.
</P>
<P>
   After his defeat to Clinton, former President George Bush had
been shunned at many Republican events. But this week, delegates
expressed supreme confidence that his son was their best hope to
retake the White House.
</P>
<P>
   Wednesday night was clearly the most festive of the week on the
convention-hall floor, as delegates tossed beach balls amid blaring
Motown music. The one somber note on the otherwise exuberant mood
was many delegates' preoccupation with the health of former
President Gerald Ford.
</P>
<P>
   Ford, who had delighted party loyalists on Tuesday night when he
appeared on the floor as part of a tribute to past Republican
presidents, was admitted to a hospital here Wednesday after
suffering at least one minor strokes.
</P>
<P>
   As he delivered the invocation, Steve Young, the former
quarterback for the San Francisco 49ers, asked a special blessing
for Ford's recovery.
</P>
<P>
   Cheney had been Ford's chief of staff at the White House. From
there, he was elected as a congressman from Wyoming, rising to the
rank of Republican whip.
</P>
<P>
   While acknowledging that Cheney's speech was the most hard-edged
of the convention, Bush's aides insisted that it did not violate
their pledge to keep the discourse from Philadelphia largely
high-minded and positive.
</P>
<P>
   ``The secretary's speech sets a new tone,'' said Ari Fleischer,
a spokesman for Bush. ``It draws contrasts with Vice President
Gore, but far more respectfully than typical politicians.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush has said to expect some barbs aimed at Gore. Yet some
passages in the speech veered closely to the personal _ especially
those that linked Gore to Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   ``As the man from Hope goes home to New York,'' Cheney said, ``
Gore tries to separate himself from his leader's shadow. But
somehow we will never see on without thinking of the other.''
</P>
<P>
   Then, he added, ``Does anyone, Republican or Democrat, seriously
believe that under Gore the next four years would be any different
from the last eight?''
</P>
<P>
   In the eight days since Bush named him as his running mate,
Cheney has found himself largely on the defensive, fighting off
attacks by Democrats that his voting record was too conservative
for most voters. They concentrated on his opposition to the Head
Start pre-school education program and his votes against a ban on
armor-piercing bullets.
</P>
<P>
   But in his speech Wednesday night, Cheney did not even allude to
the controversy _ or his own ideology _ and instead took the
opportunity to say glowing things about his former boss, then
President Bush, and about Bush's son.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Governor Bush, who arrived in Philadelphia Wednesday after a
six-day tour through six states carried by Clinton and Gore in 1992
and 1996, took to the sprawling stage at the convention hall
Wednesday afternoon to run through his acceptance address for
Thursday night.
</P>
<P>
   Expressing, perhaps, Bush's disdain of long-winded addresses _
and perhaps his own self-assuredness _ his aides said that his
acceptance speech might be the shortest in years.
</P>
<P>
   Karen Hughes, the campaign's communications director, said that
Bush speech had been completed and that _ allowing for applause
lines _ it would last roughly 38 minutes. In contrast, acceptance
speeches by his father in 1992 and Bob Dole in 1996 each ran 57
minutes.
</P>
<P>
   Beyond the effort Wednesday night for Cheney to extoll Bush's
virtues, the program was intended as an opportunity for the party
to highlight its signature economic issue: tax cuts.
</P>
<P>
   But _ as throughout the convention _ the focus was on portraying
the party not as the party of plutocrats, as Democrats have long
sought to label it, but as a party of working people.
</P>
<P>
   ``Tax cuts matter to every American, especially the working
poor,'' Gov. James Gilmore of Virginia said in his prepared
remarks.
</P>
<P>
   To drive home the point, featured speakers included a Hispanic
small-business owner, Hector Barreto, who spoke of how Bush would
help entrepreneurs by reducing the burden of taxation and
regulation, and Kim Jennings, a single mother, who spoke about how
Bush's tax plan would help her edge toward the middle class.
</P>
<P>
   Democratic officials countered that the Republicans were trying
to distract attention from the fact that Bush's tax cut proposals
would disproportionately benefit the wealthy. And Gore's aides
pressed their case that both the Republican tax cuts passed this
year by Congress and those proposed by Bush would endanger the
nation's newfound fiscal health and the economy's long-term
prospects.
</P>
<P>
   The very theme of the evening, ``prosperity with a purpose,''
contained a tacit acknowledgment that the economy is hearty, a fact
that could ultimately be expected to help Gore.
</P>
<P>
   When Bush arrived at the airport here Thursday morning, he was
greeted with a red-carpet welcome, replete with a fife and drum
corps and a replica of the Liberty Bell which he gonged. Then he
was off to the Philadelphia Museum of Art for what was billed as a
Hispanic welcome event. Latin music blared.
</P>
<P>
   Bush was introduced by his Hispanic-American nephew, George P.
Bush, who said, ``Are you excited about electing a president who
represents the diversity of our society?''
</P>
<P>
   The governor and his wife, Laura, then appeared along with Sen.
John McCain and his wife, Cindy. Bush praised his one time bitter
foe _ who offered a tribute to him at the convention on Tuesday _
as a ``living example of duty, honor and country.''
</P>
<P>
   The two couples then stood with a batch of Latino children who
sang what was called a ``Spanglish'' version of America the
Beautiful.''
</P>
<P>
   From there, Bush was off to a Republican gala lunch that was
expected to raise $10 million for the party. A large, almost life
sized, backdrop of the White House viewed from the South Lawn was
beamed on the stage behind Bush.
</P>
<P>
   In his speech on Thursday, Bush said, he would ``share with
America how proud I am and how much I love my parents.'' He told
the crowd, ``I want to thank you from the bottom of my heart. If
all goes well, if all goes well, you're looking at the next
president of the United States. God bless you.''

 NEW APPLE MONITORS ONLY WORK WITH LATEST G4S
<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR; BY HENRY NOOR &LR;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; CHRONICLE SENIOR WRITER &LR;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; 2000 San Francisco Chronicle &LR;
</P>
<P>
   Q: &LR; I've been thinking for a while about replacing the 15-inch &LR; 
 &LR; monitor I now have on my Power Mac G4 with an Apple 21-inch &LR; 
 &LR; Studio Display. But when I finally made up my mind last week &LR;   &LR; and
went to the Apple online store to order one, it wasn't &LR;   &LR; there.
What happened, and, more important, where can I get one? &LR;
</P>
<P>
   A: If you really want that particular monitor, hurry over to a
different online outlet or your favorite local dealer, and if you
see one in stock, snap it right up _ it'll soon be hard to find.
</P>
<P>
   That's because Apple abruptly discontinued its 21-inch model,
along with all the other monitors it had been selling, when it
introduced the G4 Cube and updated the rest of its desktop line at
last month's Macworld Expo. At the same time, the company rolled
three new and improved monitors _ 15- and 22-inch flat panels and a
17-inch CRT _ but they're designed only for the new Power Mac G4s
(including the new G4 Cube); they won't work with the original G4
series, or with any other older Mac.
</P>
<P>
   The reason is that the new monitors rely on a newfangled,
Apple-invented port and cable called the Apple Display Connector
(ADC). It carries not only video signals, but also electric power
to the display and data to and from the two-port USB hubs built
into the monitors' bases. Because the monitors have no other way to
get power, and earlier computer and video card don't have ADC
connectors and anyway don't provide power, there's no way to mix
the old with the new.
</P>
<P>
   That may change: Apple says it's open to talking to companies
that might want to design an adapter that would make the new
displays usable on older Macs (or even PCs, I suppose). But no such
device has been announced yet, and when and if one appears, it
probably won't be cheap, because it will have to include a power
supply.
</P>
<P>
   Besides, the new lineup doesn't even include a 21-inch monitor,
and the 22-inch Apple Cinema Display still costs a staggering
$3,999.
</P>
<P>
   I did some checking with Bay Area dealers and online discounters
earlier this week, and most of them still had the discontinued
21-inch display in stock.
</P>
<P>
   But if you can't find one, or you're not quite ready to buy,
don't panic _ dozens of other companies, including such giants as
NEC, Samsung, Sony and ViewSonic, will continue to offer 21-inch
and other displays that work with your G4. They won't match the
color and styling of your system as closely as the old Apple model,
but many of them offer comparable quality, often at lower prices.
</P>
<P>
   All of this is a little ironic: It was only last year that Apple
finally abandoned the proprietary display connectors it had been
using since the 1980s (the ``DB-15'' style _ not to mention the
even odder ``high-density'' connector that came with the first
Power Macs in 1994) and switched to industry-standard plugs.
</P>
<P>
   Fortunately, the company hasn't completely renounced these
standards; at least for now only the new monitors are strictly
dependent on the company's latest proprietary scheme. The Cube and
the other new G4s still have a conventional VGA connector alongside
the new ADC, so customers in the opposite situation from yours _
people hoping to use an existing monitor with a new Mac _ don't
need to worry; any standard monitor should just plug and play when
connected to that port on a new G4.
</P>
<P>
   Q: I have about 800 dates that I have entered in a database in
AppleWorks. The format is mm/dd/yy. I want to sort these by year.
However, when I sort using the ``Sort records'' command, I get a
list sorted by month first, e.g. January (1), then December (12),
then October (10), next comes February (2) and so forth. I have
been unable to find a process or formula to sort by year, month and
day, in the above format. None of the ``dummy'' books or the Mac's
user manual help. I have tried placing the year first, e.g. yy/
mm/dd. This gives me the year sort, but the months are still out of
sorts. Hope you can help.
</P>
<P>
   A: There are lots of problems with AppleWorks 6, even after two
recent updates, but as far as I can tell, this isn't one of them _
I made several test databases of my own and can't reproduce your
problem.
</P>
<P>
   It's conceivable that some odd extension conflict on your system
is causing it, but my guess is something else: I'll bet that when
you created your database, you made the date field a ``text'' type
field. It's easy to do, because that's the default type in
AppleWorks, and it works for most fields in most simple databases.
But when you sort on such a field, the program won't know it's
working with date information _ it will interpret the data as a
simple string of numbers and therefore put your records in the odd
order you're seeing.
</P>
<P>
   To solve the problem, open your database, go to the Layout menu
and choose ``Define Fields.'' You'll see a screen listing all the
fields in your database, and if my guess is right, you'll see
``Text'' listed as the type next to your date field. To change it
to ``Date,'' click on the field name to select it, then click on
the ``Modify'' button, then choose ``Date'' from the pop-up menu
labeled Type.
</P>
<P>
   Once you've made that change, your data should sort in proper
chronological order.
</P>
<P>
   By the way, if you're using AppleWorks 6.0 or 6.0.3, it's well
worth your while to upgrade to the latest version, 6.0.4. You can
download a free updater at
 &LR; asu.info.apple.com/swupdates.nsf/artnum/n11700 &LR; .

<P>
   PRINTING FAVORITES
</P>
<P>
   Q: I use Internet Explorer 4.5 to browse the Web from my iMac.
I'd like to print out a list of the Web sites on my Favorites menu,
but I can't figure out how. I've even looked in a number of
reference books, but I haven't been able to find any answers. Can
you help?
</P>
<P>
   A: That's a simple question that deserves a simple answer.
Unfortunately, it doesn't have one. I did finally dig up a few
solutions, but none is completely satisfactory.
</P>
<P>
   The problem, as you evidently discovered, is that IE 4.5 (or
5.0, for that matter) won't print either its Favorites ``pane'' or
its more-detailed Favorites window.
</P>
<P>
   Not finding any pertinent advice in IE's Help file, and seeing
that neither of the two shareware utilities I've previously
recommended for other printing problems _ Net-Print and WebPrint
Plus _ solves this one, I appealed for assistance to the PR person
for Microsoft's Mac applications. An hour or two later, I had an
answer: ``There is not a direct command inside IE that automates
this, but here is a way to print out the Fav's:
</P>
<P>
   From the File menu in IE, choose Open File. Navigate to System
Folder: Preferences: Explorer. Open the file named Favorites.html.
Choose Print from the File menu.''
</P>
<P>
   That works, as long as all you need printed are the names of
your Favorites, together with the brief descriptions many sites
embed in the HTML code for their pages.
</P>
<P>
   What you don't get are the URLs _ the actual Web addresses of
your Favorites. Without them, you or anyone else reading your
printout would have a hard time getting to the sites listed.
</P>
<P>
   But the only ways I found to get a printout including the URLs
are all pretty complicated. The simplest is probably to open the
Favorites page, as above, then choose Source from the View menu. A
new window will open, containing the HTML source code for the page,
which includes the names, descriptions and URLs. You can print that
page right from IE, but you'll probably want to copy its contents
into your word processor so you can get rid of the ugly code
cluttering it up.
</P>
<P>
   An alternative is to take and print a screen shot of IE's
Favorites window. Go to the Favorites menu and click ``Organize
favorites.'' Open any closed folders and, if necessary, adjust the
width of the Name column (by clicking just to the left of the line
that separates the column headers) and of the whole window, so all
URLs will be displayed in full.
</P>
<P>
   Now, to save that screen, you'll need one of the Mac's more
obscure keyboard shortcuts: press your CapsLock key, then,
simultaneously, Command-Shift-4. Your cursor will turn into a sort
of bull's eye. Put it anywhere in IE's Favorites window and click.
</P>
<P>
   That will save a picture of that window, in PICT format, on your
startup hard drive _ it will be saved in the root (main) directory
of your startup hard drive under the name Picture 1 (or Picture 2,
3, whatever, if you've previously created other screen shots).
</P>
<P>
   If you have too many favorites to fit all at once in the window,
scroll down and take another screen shot; repeat as necessary. Now
rename these files to something more meaningful and, if you wish,
move them to a new folder so they won't clutter up your main
directory.
</P>
<P>
   To print them, you can open them with just about any Mac
graphics or word processing program, including SimpleText, the
mini-editor that comes with the Mac OS. To make sure the URLs don't
get spread across a page break, you may want to go to the Page
Setup command on the File menu and switch to landscape (horizontal)
orientation or reduce the scale to less than 100 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Aside from the convoluted procedure, the problem with this
approach is that what you end up with is just a picture, so you
can't edit or even copy the site names or URLs. A third solution
that avoids this problem is to download a $30 shareware utility
called URL Manager Pro, which you can find at
 &LR; www.url-manager.com &LR; .
</P>
<P>
   Install it, then use its ``Get from Browser'' command to bring
in your IE Favorites.
</P>
<P>
   The names and URLs of these sites will be shown in URL Manager
Pro's main window. You could print them from there, but there's a
problem: The program simply cuts off the ends of addresses too long
to fit in two lines. If you enter the truncated URL in your
browser, it won't work.
</P>
<P>
   You can work around this by using URL Manager Pro's Export
command to save the list as text. That way, you'll get the full
URL, along with site names and descriptions, in a tab-delimited
text file. The downside to this approach is that such files are
pretty hard to read unless you import and reformat them with a word
processor or spreadsheet _ yet more steps.
</P>
<P>
   If anyone has a better solution, let me know and I'll include it
next month.
</P>
<P>
   TIP OF THE MONTH
</P>
<P>
   There are lots of great add-on utility programs _ most of them
shareware _ that make it easier to open files, folders and
applications you use regularly, but I've recently discovered one
that's even more flexible. Called Drop Drawers, it lets you line
the sides of your screen with small tabs.
</P>
<P>
   When you move the mouse over them, they slide out to reveal a
``drawer'' where you can store just about anything you use
regularly: Aliases to files, folders and applications, URLs for Web
sites, e-mail addresses, snippets of text (complete with character
styling if you wish), even pictures, movies and sounds.
</P>
<P>
   The program is from Sig Software, and you can get more
information and download a copy at
 &LR; www.sigsoftware.com/dropdrawers/index.html &LR; . If you keep it, don't
forget to pay the $15 shareware fee.
</P>

and what version of the Mac OS you're using.

 CHATTING WITH SOUND, PICTURES
<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR; BY CARRIE KIRBY &LR;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; CHRONICLE STAFF WRITER &LR;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; 2000 San Francisco Chronicle &LR;
</P>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ &LR;   &LR; When Jayson Agagnier chats online with his
4-month-old nephew, the two sit in front of Internet cameras so
that they can see each other while they talk.
</P>
<P>
   The San Francisco resident also likes to use a laptop with a
cellular modem and Webcam to capture images of the city's streets _
as viewed from the front of a cable car.
</P>
<P>
   With permission from Muni, he attaches a camera to the front of
a cable car about once a month and beams the images to his personal
Web page.
</P>
<P>
   He can capture only still photos that update every few seconds,
but faster cellular modems will soon be available that will allow
him to broadcast live video as the car rolls from the wharf to
downtown.
</P>
<P>
   Welcome to the fast-moving world of Webcasting.
</P>
<P>
   Internet cameras have been around as long as the World Wide Web
itself. Until recently, plugging a camera into a computer and
broadcasting images of yourself to the world was something only
geeks did. The Web is still full of live cameras showing the
insides of computer labs.
</P>
<P>
   Today, the availability of cheaper cameras and free Web-based
services are making broadcasting pictures and live video onto the
Internet so easy that regular people are using Webcams to share
special moments with family or hold everyday conversations.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, Web sites such as SpotLife and Camarades are supplying
everything needed for free online camera use with the hope that Web
broadcasting can be as common a way to stay in touch as e-mail.
</P>
<P>
   To be sure, a few barriers remain before Webcasting can become
part of our daily lives. For people without broadband Internet
connections, video images move slowly and appear jerky.
</P>
<P>
   And because many free services list all their members in a
directory and don't offer password-protected private
videoconferencing, some broadcasters may find that they are
sacrificing their privacy to go online.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the setbacks, it is relatively easy to be a Webcaster.
</P>
<P>
   Today's Webcams are capable of recording still pictures, video
and audio. Unlike digital cameras, Webcams have to be physically
attached to a computer to work.
</P>
<P>
   Users plug the Webcam into the computer and then log on to
SpotLife or a similar Web site, which guides them through an easy
setup process that usually takes about half an hour.
</P>
<P>
   It didn't use to be this easy. Before these free Webcasting
services came along, would-be Internet broadcasters had to spend a
lot of time setting up servers and figuring out how to make
pictures appear on their personal Web pages. Now it's not even
necessary to have a Web page to broadcast, because the Web sites
mentioned above provide a place to store video and images online.
</P>
<P>
   Analyst Jeremy Schwartz said sharing video online like Agagnier
and his nephew do is the natural next step in the evolutionary
chain from e-mailing photos and greeting cards.
</P>
<P>
   ``The use of rich media (images, video and sound) as a
communications method among consumers is just going to go through
the roof,'' Schwartz said. In a recent report for his employer,
Forrester Research, Schwartz predicted that in five years, when
broadband DSL or cable modem connections are more common, 92
percent of consumers will use visuals and audio to communicate on
the Internet once a month.
</P>
<P>
   The price of Webcams are falling, from about $300 a few years
ago to less than $100. Last month, mainstream Webcam use got a
boost when Compaq began including a Logitech QuickCam and SpotLife
software with each Presario it sells.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Webcam technology is getting better and more fun to
use. Traditional Webcams show photographs, updated periodically _
as slowly as once every 15 minutes, or as rapidly as 30 times a
second.
</P>
<P>
   In the past, Webcams have been silent. But now, broadband
connections and free Webcasting services make it possible for
ordinary people to broadcast streaming videos and sound.
</P>
<P>
   Another developing technology, cellular modems, is making it
possible to use Webcams to show the folks at home what you're doing
on vacation. Like cell phones, cellular modems are mobile, giving
Webcasters the freedom to leave their homes and capture outdoor
scenes.
</P>
<P>
   Some say Webcam technology still has room for improvement.
Warren Slocum, San Mateo county clerk, and his two children use
Webcams to chat with Slocum's father a few times a week. ``It's not
like a smooth motion picture, but the quality is OK for what it
is,'' Slocum said.
</P>
<P>
   While he and his father found setting up the cameras easy,
Slocum said it took awhile to get used to talking to a camera while
looking at the computer screen. The experience is more like using a
walkie-talkie than a telephone, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``You have to get in the rhythm _ one person talks, the other
person listens. You can't be talking simultaneously,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Because both Slocum and his father have a Webcam, they both can
see each other while they talk.
</P>
<P>
   Web broadcasters, though, can easily interact with friends who
don't have Webcams by using text chat. Camarades and most other
online Webcam sites offer chat rooms that appear right next to or
below the Webcam image, so the users can chat and view video at the
same time.
</P>
<P>
   Others use their Webcams to record video, then send it as an
e-mail attachment or post it online.
</P>
<P>
   Not everyone will feel comfortable opening family events or
conversations to the public. While some Webcam services, such as
SpotLife, make it possible to protect broadcasts with a password so
only the intended viewer can see it, other services, such as
Camarades, don't have password protection.
</P>
<P>
   Albert Chlubna, a Camarades user who lives in Pacifica, has
experienced harassment from unintended viewers. In exchange for its
free service, Camarades requires all broadcasters to be listed in
its directory. That means anyone who wants to can see any of the
content.
</P>
<P>
   Chlubna set up a Webcam on Camarades so his girlfriend could see
him from her home in Australia. But he soon began receiving daily
unwanted e-mails and instant messages from men he didn't know.
</P>
<P>
   Recently he posted an indignant message on his page, telling
viewers that he is not ginterested in receiving any comments.
</P>
<P>
   A little unpleasantness is not too large a price to pay in
exchange for the free service, Chlubna said. But he has a warning
for new Web broadcasters: ``Be prepared for harassment. You open
yourself up to it.''
</P>
<P>
   Other camera users see things they don't want to see when
browsing through the camera directories listed on Camarades and
other Webcast services. Some sites, such as SpotLife, ban sexual
and violent content. Others, including Camarades, permit adult
content, but only in a designated adult section.
</P>
<P>
   Both SpotLife and Camarades offer special sections for families
and children, but some users complain about cameras displaying
adult material in these special areas.
</P>
<P>
   A host of Camarades' family section, Ohio dad Denver Harris
spends about two evenings a week looking at the different Webcams
listed in his section. Recently he found someone broadcasting adult
content, and he sent the person a stern e-mail asking him to stop.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to using volunteer monitors such as Harris,
Camarades and many other sites encourage viewers to report naughty
broadcasters.
</P>
<P>
   Each user page on Camarades has a ``cyberpatrol'' button.
Pushing it takes a snapshot of the broadcast and submits it to
Camarades staff, who will remove the camera from the site if they
deem the image offensive.

 VCS STILL BETTING ON TECH COMPANIES
<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR; BY PETER SINTON &LR;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; CHRONICLE SENIOR WRITER &LR;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; 2000 San Francisco Chronicle &LR;
</P>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ Despite the jittery stock market since March,
venture capital investors continue to pour near record amounts of
money into Internet and other startups.
</P>
<P>
   In the past quarter, 1,054 U.S. companies received $17.2 billion
in venture financing, according to a report issued yesterday by
VentureOne Corp., a San Francisco research firm that tracks VC
investments. The number companies which received VC money was 30
fewer, or 3 percent, and the amount of money was down $1 billion,
or 6 percent, from the previous quarter.
</P>
<P>
   So far this year, VC firms have invested almost as much money in
private companies as they did during all of 1999. Midway through
2000, 2,138 companies raised $35.4 billion, just $2 billion less
than the $37.4 billion raised by 3,153 companies during all of last
year.
</P>
<P>
   In the most recent April through June quarter, information
technology companies enjoyed their strongest quarter ever,
receiving $10.1 billion, or 10 percent more than the previous
quarter. That increase may come as a surprise since the
technology-laden Nasdaq index declined 13 percent during the same
period.
</P>
<P>
   ``The recent public-market fluctuations led many industry
watchers to anticipate an overall drop in activity,'' said Sasha
Talebi, VentureOne's director of research. ``But in fact, companies
in most sectors have weathered the storm and continue to receive
financing from their venture backers, as well as valuable advice on
adapting their business models to the current climate.''
</P>
<P>
   Internet-related companies across all industry sectors accounted
for a record 86 percent of all money invested in the past quarter
and 79 percent of all deals. But not all Internet niches are hot.
</P>
<P>
   Investments in infrastructure companies went up 29 percent in
the second quarter after going up 47 percent in the first quarter
from the last quarter of 1999.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, e-commerce investment, which fell 50 percent between
the fourth quarter of 1999 and the first quarter of this year, fell
an additional 32 percent in the second quarter over the previous
quarter. That drops dot-com investments to 3 percent of all
Internet investments, the lowest percentage in almost three years.
</P>
<P>
   In recent months, VC investors repeatedly have delivered
additional cash to companies that delayed or canceled plans to sell
stock to the public. Yesterday, for example, Linuxcare Inc. of San
Francisco said it raised $30 million in third-round financing from
various VC and corporate backers.
</P>
<P>
   Linuxcare, which provides technical support and services for
Linux operating software, planned to raise $70 million in April
with an initial public offering. But it canceled IPO plans after
Chief Executive Officer Fernand Sarrat resigned as a result of
conflicts with the company's directors and investors suddenly lost
their appetite for many high-tech stocks.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of companies that queued up to go public have gone back
to the venture capital well,'' said Paul Vais, general partner of
Patricof &AMP; Co. in Palo Alto, which led Linuxcare's previous round
of financing in December.
</P>
<P>
   Pat Lambs, who heads Linuxcare's office of the CEO while the
company recruits a permanent replacement to Sarrat, said that the
company's early backers and new ones such as Lehman Brothers
Venture Capital ``stepped up to the plate immediately.''
</P>
<P>
   Fortunately, ``there is no shortage of companies that need
funding and no shortage of funds to be put to work,'' Vais said.
</P>
<P>
   Several VC firms including Spectrum Equity Investors, Softbank
Venture Capital and Mayfield Fund, each raised $1 billion or more
for their latest investment funds.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've seen a lot of dot-com fatalities and less willingness to
finance highly speculative business plans,'' said Vais. ``Weak
companies are getting weeded out but that's healthy.''

 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)   &HT;    Ford recovering from stroke
 &HT;    Former president's condition termed good by doctors
 &HT;    
 &HT;    
 &HT;    
 &HT;    By LETITIA STEIN 
c. 2000 Houston Chronicle &HT;    
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHILADELPHIA _ Former President Ford remained in good condition
Wednesday at a hospital here after suffering one, possibly two,
small strokes while in town for the Republican National Convention.
</P>
<P>
   Ford continued to experience some imbalance and slurring of
speech into the evening, said doctors who predicted a full recovery
for the 87-year-old former president from Michigan. He remains in
the intensive care unit, a hospital spokeswoman said Wednesday
night.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think the president should totally recover from this,'' said
Robert Schwartzman, chief of neurology at the Hahnemann University
Hospital. ``He has a little trouble with his speech, a little
trouble with swallowing, but he should totally recover.''
</P>
<P>
   Ford was admitted to the hospital in downtown Philadelphia about
9 a.m. Wednesday when doctors diagnosed a small brain-stem stroke.
He had been treated at the hospital the previous night for pain in
the right side of his face but was immediately released without
further examination.
</P>
<P>
   Based on conversations with former first lady Betty Ford,
doctors said there is cause to believe the former president
experienced an initial stroke earlier in the week, when he was
reportedly off balance.
</P>
<P>
   Doctors said Ford exhibited different symptoms when he came to
the hospital Wednesday morning than during his first visit after
his appearance at the Republican convention Tuesday night. Doctors
diagnosed a sinus infection and gave him some antibiotics.
</P>
<P>
   Doctors said Ford will remain hospitalized here for five to six
days to undergo further evaluation. Philadelphia doctors have been
in touch with a family physician who was treating Ford for pain in
his tongue.
</P>
<P>
   Doctors said Ford appeared calm and was fully aware of what had
occurred. Betty Ford was upset but holding up well.
</P>
<P>
   By late afternoon, Ford was ``saying that he feels great and
that he'd like to go home,'' said physician Carole Thomas.
</P>
<P>
   Republicans honored Ford during a tribute to former GOP
presidents at the convention Tuesday night. Ford appeared to be in
fine health, waving with both hands to an enthusiastic crowd.
</P>
<P>
   America's 38th president, Ford assumed office on Aug. 9, 1974,
after President Nixon resigned in the face of almost-certain
impeachment for his involvement in the Watergate scandal.
</P>
<P>
   Ford was the first American president to serve as both vice
president and president without being elected to either position.
In 1976, Ford was narrowly defeated for the presidency by Jimmy
Carter after pardoning Nixon for any crimes related to Watergate.
</P>
<P>
   Texas Gov. George W. Bush, who arrived Wednesday to claim his
party's presidential nomination, said he called Betty Ford and that
she sounded hopeful that her husband would make a full recovery.

 FORMER DESIGN DIRECTOR AT WIRED HAS GROWN TIRED OF SAN FRANCISCO

<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ One of the plum jobs in magazine design is about
to open up.
</P>
<P>
   Daniel Carter, design director at Wired, is moving to Los
Angeles, leaving big shoes to fill at the groundbreaking magazine.
</P>
<P>
   In an e-mail, Wired Editor in Chief Katrina Heron said, ``Daniel
is a supremely gifted designer (with a long, though not continuous,
history at Wired) and also a very skilled manager and motivator of
his team _ he will be very difficult to replace.''
</P>
<P>
   Even though plenty of people didn't like it, and still don't,
Wired's pioneering design has left its mark all over tech
publishing. One needs only look to the Industry Standard and
Business 2.0 _ both founded by Wired alumni _ to see the influence.
</P>
<P>
   Carter was at Wired at the start, working under legendary
designers John Plunkett and Thomas Schneider. He left the magazine
after only two years, first starting his own design studio and then
helping to launch the Standard.
</P>
<P>
   When Conde Nast bought Wired in 1998, Carter came back and
helped give the magazine a cleaner, more readable look _ while
keeping some of the trademark edge.
</P>
<P>
   He said he and Heron sought to make Wired ``what it should be
now, a more mature, well-established magazine. It's not a young
teenager screaming for attention, but more of a fast-running
adult.''
</P>
<P>
   He's most proud of April's cover, with its clean, simple design
touting Bill Joy's provocative article, ``Why the future doesn't
need us.''
</P>
<P>
   It appears, though, that two years at Wired is Carter's limit.
He's promised Heron he'll keep working from Los Angeles until the
end of the year, and she said she's in no hurry to fill his
position.
</P>
<P>
   His new wife, Aimee Marquis Carter, is design director for the
Industry Standard's new Grok magazines, which will premiere in
mid-August.
</P>
<P>
   The Carters figure they'll open their own design studio, but
other than that, Daniel Carter isn't sure what path his career will
take.
</P>
<P>
   What the Yountville native does know, at age 31, is that he
needs to leave San Francisco _ partly because he wants to live in a
bigger, more bustling city; partly because he's tired of running
into dot-com millionaires; and partly because he can't afford a
house and was just evicted from his rental for the second time in a
little more than a year.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is less about leaving Wired and more about leaving San
Francisco,'' Carter said. ``The factors were numerous.''
</P>
<P>
   DEJA VU: The Industry Standard may have more in common with
Wired than merely its look or its pedigree.
</P>
<P>
   &LR; COL. 1 of MEDIA03 (23968 ) &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &LR;  The Standard's parent company, International Data Group, said in
November that it was eyeing a potential public stock offering for
the Standard by mid-2000.
</P>
<P>
   That was before the Nasdaq's debacle in April killed most
Internet IPOs, and you don't hear that talk coming out of IDG
anymore. Of course, it's not too hard to think of another tech
magazine that came even closer to an IPO but never got out of the
gate: Wired.
</P>
<P>
   John Battelle was Wired's managing editor at the time of the
failed IPO of 1996, when the market proved unwilling to give big
bucks to an unprofitable enterprise.
</P>
<P>
   Does that give Battelle _ the founder and chief executive
officer of the Standard _ any deja vu?
</P>
<P>
   ``Living through Wired got me very, very sure of one thing,''
Battelle said. ``You should never go public until you're ready.
It's not about the market. It's if your company is ready.''
</P>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR; Um, wasn't the problem more with the market, not with Wired's
business? After all, within two years of Wired's failed IPO, plenty
of money-losing companies scored huge valuations on Wall Street.
</P>
<P>
   Battelle says the issue is moot, because the Standard has ``four
times the revenue Wired had and a (ship)-load of profits, and a
great management team.'' He says the Standard, in its first two
years, has grown to more than 340 employees and revenue in the
``nine figures'' (read: more than $100 million). Because it remains
privately held, he doesn't have to reveal specifics.
</P>
<P>
   ``The only sense of deja vu I might have about Wired was the
rocket ride,'' Battelle said. ``This has been even faster and
bigger than Wired in terms of the raw numbers.''
</P>
<P>
   An IPO, Battelle said, ``is not a requirement of our business,
nor is it something we've ruled out. ... It's one of several
options we continue to consider.''
</P>
<P>
   BACK TO CALIFORNIA: It's moving week for former Chronicle
columnist Herb Greenberg, who has had enough of the East Coast and
is returning to the Golden State _ although not to the Bay Area.
</P>
<P>
   Greenberg, a columnist with TheStreet.com, is keeping his job,
but moving from New Jersey to San Diego.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's the great thing about working for an Internet
publication,'' Greenberg said. ``I write from my home in New
Jersey, why not in San Diego?''
</P>
<P>
   His move also reflects that he no longer appears on television,
as TheStreet's show was canceled in a dispute between the company
and Fox, which was airing it. He said he also doesn't need to be
near Wall Street for the kind of reporting he does.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've never been a big let's-go-do-lunch type of guy,'' he
said. ``I do the phone. I'm on the phone all the time. It's more
effective. Different journalists have different opinions, but I do
two columns a day. I don't have time to screw around at lunch.''
</P>
<P>
   TAKING PITCHES: It was the sort of event a public relations firm
should dream of, but instead the flacks blew it worse than any
World Series pitch from Mitch ``Wild Thing'' Williams.
</P>
<P>
   A softball team composed of folks from the San Francisco office
of the PR firm Golin/Harris was scheduled to play a media team
consisting of reporters from Newsweek, the New York Times, ZDNet
and National Public Radio, as well as authors and free-lancers like
Po Bronson and Ethan Watters.
</P>
<P>
   The media team, the Elucidators, was at the appointed Presidio
field Monday at 9 p.m., but Golin/Harris never showed up.
</P>
<P>
   ``For once we were ready to take their pitches, and they blew
it,'' Newsweek's Brad Stone told Poynter Institute media columnist
Jim Romenesko.
</P>
<P>
   Naturally, Golin has a spin on the story. ``It just proves we
work harder than the journalists,'' said Golin account executive
Jackie Jones, who hastened to add, ``I'm kidding!''
</P>
<P>
   She said her team figured it was playing some average Joes, not
media heavies. ``If we had known, then not only the 10 players on
the team, but our entire office would have been there,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Jones wants a rematch, but Stone won't hear of it. ``Maybe we'll
meet in the playoffs, and we can settle the grudge then,'' Stone
said in an e-mail.
</P>
<P>
   But don't bet on it: Stone boasts that the Elucidators are 3-1,
while Golin/Harris is 0-4.
</P>
<P>
   MERCS, MORE OR LESS: Readers of certain editions of the San Jose
Mercury News will get an expanded definition of ``local news'' this
month.
</P>
<P>
   According to an internal e-mail, a staffing shortage has led the
Merc to merge its Valley, South Valley and Coast editions into one
big combination ``local and state edition.''
</P>
<P>
   From the memo, I gather that when the copy editors and graphic
designers return from vacation after Labor Day, local news will
once again be local in those particular editions.

SUBTLE CONTROL OVER THE PODIUM
</HEADLINE>
 By ADAM NAGOURNEY   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHILADELPHIA _ Like nearly all the speakers who have taken the
sprawling and colorful stage at the Republican convention here,
Melissa Hart, a candidate for Congress from Pennsylvania, made sure
to submit an early draft of her remarks to aides to Gov. George W.
Bush for review and approval.
</P>
<P>
   It was returned, she said on Wednesday, with just one
instruction: Cut it to a minute from 90 seconds, with no direction
on what she should take out.
</P>
<P>
   Her experience was not unusual. The week has been characterized
by rigid displays of discipline, with Bush's lieutenants roaming
the floor with schedules that list the precise second that each
event is supposed to occur, and delegates being handed daily
talking points to guide their interviews with reporters.
</P>
<P>
   But the control over what is being said from the stage has taken
a decidedly subtler form, albeit with precisely the uniform result
sought by Bush's aides.
</P>
<P>
   Four years ago, speeches at the Republican convention in San
Diego were diligently reviewed and monitored by convention
organizers, who insisted that speakers promise to stick to their
script before allowing them to go on. This year, convention
organizers have used a velvet hammer on a receptive cast to achieve
a uniformity of message, as well as a near silence on topics like
abortion, gun control and President Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   The planners have built each night around a specific theme,
carefully choosing elected officials and members of the public who
can speak to that theme. The elected officials are given broad
guidelines on what to say and are told as well what not to say: no
harsh attacks that can recall the convention of 1992. One speaker,
however, was given a pass from that rule: Dick Cheney, who took
several shots tonight at Clinton and Vice President Al Gore.
</P>
<P>
   The public figures were asked to submit all speeches for review.
The main concerns of the ``auditors,'' as the convention speech
screeners are called, has been to keep the talks short and upbeat,
so as not to interfere with the snappy, happy production
Republicans organizers are seeking to present to the American
public, according to speakers and convention officials alike.
</P>
<P>
   That is not to suggest that dissidents are clamoring for floor
time. ``There just hasn't had to be the usual arm-twisting,'' one
of Bush's senior advisers said, with clear relief.
</P>
<P>
   These are different times, and Republican leaders have made the
best of them. There are no rebels trying to commandeer the
microphone, and no opposition candidates vying for attention.
Indeed, the most potentially risky moment for Bush's convention
organizers should have been when Sen. John McCain of Arizona, who
lost the nomination to Bush, appeared on Tuesday. But McCain had
submitted his speech to Bush in advance, and not a single change
was demanded.
</P>
<P>
   ``I saw the draft,'' said Mike Murphy, formerly McCain's
strategist. ``It went to Bush and I saw the draft after it came
back. I can't remember a single change.''
</P>
<P>
   McCain was one of Bush's sharpest critics in the primaries,
saying at one point that the governor ``twists the truth'' like
Clinton, and he was the only major rival of the Texas governor to
speak at the convention. Yet in this environment, where Republicans
are intent on not doing anything that might distract from the march
to the nomination, McCain was not about to harm his future standing
with the party.
</P>
<P>
   Beyond the question of McCain, Bush's absolute control of the
convention has been evident every night in the choice of speakers
and their content, the result of a team that includes Andrew Card,
former secretary of transportation who is chairman of the
convention, and Ed Gillespie, who is in charge of assigning and
reviewing each day's events. With such a free hand, Bush's advisers
built each evening around a theme.
</P>
<P>
   In interviews, many speakers said they were given only general
marching orders. Rep. Vito J. Fossella, the Staten Island
Republican, was asked to speak on Social Security, an interest with
which he has been identified in the House and all his life, since
his great-grandfather, James A. O'Leary, a congressman who
represented Staten Island from 1936 to 1944, voted to create Social
Security. ``The conversation was very straightforward: They asked
me if I'd be interested in speaking on Social Security and
Medicare,'' Fossella said.
</P>
<P>
   ``They said they wanted a positive speech,'' he said. ``That was
it.''
</P>
<P>
   A Republican aide assigned to help work with speakers in 1996
and this year said there was a marked difference in the process
this time. The aide said that one of the main speakers, Gen. Colin
Powell, was allowed to tinker with his speech up to two hours
before he went on. That would not have been permitted when Bob Dole
was nominated by a more divided convention in 1996.
</P>
<P>
   ``They would not put a word on the teleprompter until it was
scrubbed,'' the aide said of 1996. ``This time, it seemed all they
were concerned about was the number of words.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, a number of speakers said that time, not substance,
seemed to be the top concern of Bush's convention organizers. Sen.
Arlen Specter of Pennsylvania said that when he submitted his
greeting to convention planners for review, they left in a veiled
reference to Specter's support of abortion rights, but asked him to
cut a joke that put a positive spin on W.C. Fields' famously
disparaging remark about the city and his home state, just to save
a few minutes.
</P>
<P>
   Specter said he told them that he wanted the joke to stay. And
it did.

 CHIRON REPORTS SURPRISINGLY STRONG PROFITS
<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR; BY TOM ABATE &LR;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; CHRONICLE STAFF WRITER &LR;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; 2000 San Francisco Chronicle &LR;
</P>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ Chiron Corp. reported second-quarter earnings
Wednesday that far exceeded Wall Street's expectations, but
analysts reading between lines wondered whether the biotech giant
isn't headed for a second-half slowdown.
</P>
<P>
   On first reading the numbers looked great, as the Emeryville
firm reported earnings of 30 cents per share, beating analysts'
estimates by 9 cents a share.
</P>
<P>
   Profits from continuing operations rose to $57 million, up 67
percent from the $34 million (18 cents per share) that the company
reported during the same period last year.
</P>
<P>
   Chiron said its second-quarter revenues rose to $241 million, up
27 percent from its $189 million in sales a year ago. Chiron's
vaccines business drove the increase, contributing $92 million in
the quarter _ a stunning 136 percent increase over the $39 million
in vaccine sales the company reported this time last year.
</P>
<P>
   But some analysts came away from a post-earning conference call
with the impression that Chiron expected its earnings to dip the
rest of the year.
</P>
<P>
   Chiron issues a 12-month earnings-per-share target to guide
analysts. Before yesterday's announcement, the company's target was
78 cents per share. Yesterday, it raised that figure to between 80
and 85 cents.
</P>
<P>
   This puzzled analysts. The company had already beat year-to-date
earnings expectations by 9 cents. To boost the annual target from
only two to seven cents per share suggests that Chiron expects its
earnings will drop two cents in the second half.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's what one would read between the lines,'' said Viren
Mehta, a principal at Mehta Partners in New York.
</P>
<P>
   Chiron declined to elaborate on its earnings forecast.
</P>
<P>
   Jim McCamant, who follows Chiron for the Medical Technology
Stock Letter in Berkeley, said analysts were also concerned about a
recent string of disappointments with Chiron's experimental drugs.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, for instance, the company halted clinical trials of a
drug for osteoarthritis. In March, one of its heart medications
failed a clinical trial. In September, it paused work on an ulcer
remedy.
</P>
<P>
   ``Wall Street still has a feeling that Chiron can't get drugs on
the market,'' McCamant said.
</P>
<P>
   McCamant said analysts are also irked that Chiron is still
sitting on more than $1 billion in cash it earned in 1998 after it
sold off a business unit. The company has repeatedly said it
planned to use some of that money to acquire promising late-stage
drugs, ``but it still hasn't done that,'' McCamant said.
</P>
<P>
   Joyce Lonergan, Chiron's vice president for investor relations,
emphasized that this was, after all, a very strong quarter. She
said that if Chiron has a problem with Wall Street, it stems from
the company's unusual business model.
</P>
<P>
   Investors tend to value drug and biotech firms based on
blockbuster products, Lonergan said. But Chiron's sales flow from a
series of niche products _ vaccines, a handful of drugs and a new
blood-testing business _ that are obviously profitable without
being home runs.
</P>
<P>
   Lonergan said Chiron's short-term prospects of expanding its
vaccine business in Europe are good, and it is poised to turn its
blood-testing unit into a big revenue engine in 2001.
</P>
<P>
   As for using its cash horde to acquire new products from smaller
startups, she said Chiron has looked and will continue to look but
won't be pushed into buying.
</P>
<P>
   ``The cash is something we are going to spend carefully, not
just burn,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   McCamant said Chiron also has an ace in the hole that it can't
officially factor into its earnings forecasts. In recent months,
Chiron has won key court battles in a long-running patent fight
with the Swiss drug giant Roche. McCamant believes Roche is on the
verge of settling the dispute _ which would mean a big cash payment
and royalties for Chiron.
</P>
<P>
   Lonergan said Chiron is ``in a real dialogue'' with Roche but
declined to comment further.
</P>
<P>
   Chiron shares gained 13 cents yesterday to close at $44.75. The
report was released just before the market closed.

 WEBCASTING SERVICES HELP END EQUIPMENT HASSLES

   SAN FRANCISCO _ One problem with personal Webcasting is that the
moments you most want to share with distant relatives _ weddings,
new babies _ are often spent instead buying and setting up
equipment to do the job.
</P>
<P>
   Recognizing this, services are popping up to help people
broadcast those special moments with a minimum of hassle.
</P>
<P>
   At San Jose's Good Samaritan hospital, many new parents are
introducing their infants with a free service called
BabyPressConference.com.
</P>
<P>
   Months in advance, the parents-to-be give the company e-mail
addresses of friends and relatives. When the big day arrives, the
parents call BabyPressConference.com to schedule a conference
within the following 24 hours. The company then informs the
invitees of the show time, Web address and password.
</P>
<P>
   The parents and baby go to a special Webcasting room in Good
Samaritan's maternity area, where they log into
BabyPressConference.com, smile into the camera, and begin talking
to their audience.
</P>
<P>
   Viewers can type in questions, which appear on the parents'
computer screen. The parents reply, speaking into the camera.
</P>
<P>
   A popular request: Hold the baby closer to the camera so we can
see who she looks like.
</P>
<P>
   The system is so easy to use that parents conduct the news
conference without help from hospital staff.
</P>
<P>
   Since introducing the service in April, Good Samaritan has
played host to 40 Webcasts, with 100 expectant parents signed up,
said Melanie Norall, the hospital's community relations director.
The service is free to the hospital, parents and viewers.
BabyPressConference.com hopes to profit from selling baby gifts to
viewers.
</P>
<P>
   There are glitches, especially if viewers use dial-up
connections. For example, if the video feed freezes for a few
seconds after a question is typed in, a viewer might miss the
parents' answer.
</P>
<P>
   Similar services have been offered for weddings and funerals.
Some wedding chapels and churches Webcast ceremonies. For example,
Las Vegas' A Little White Chapel shows a wedding every six minutes,
24 hours a day, on the Discovery Channel's Web site
 &LR; (www.discovery.com &LR; ).
</P>
<P>
   The San Mateo county courthouse Webcast weddings on Valentine's
Day last year but doesn't offer the service on a regular basis.
</P>
<P>
   In Scottsdale, Ariz., a funeral home, Messenger Mortuaries,
Webcasts funerals on a password-protected site.

 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)   &HT;    Bush arrives at convention amid fanfare
 &HT;    Cheney speech questions integrity of Clinton-Gore
 &HT;    
 &HT;

c. 2000 Houston Chronicle &HT;    
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHILADELPHIA _ The tightly scripted Republican convention
Wednesday moved closer to its anticipated climax as George W. Bush
arrived with great fanfare in Philadelphia while his running mate
Dick Cheney roused delegates by questioning the integrity of the
Clinton-Gore team.
</P>
<P>
   Cheney's stinging prime-time speech provided the first
opportunity for many voters to hear Bush's surprise pick for vice
president, a former oil executive and Wyoming congressman who
served as President Bush's defense secretary during the Persian
Gulf War.
</P>
<P>
   Republicans hoped that his nationally televised performance
would dispel doubts about Cheney sown by Democrats who have have
relentlessly attacked him for being too conservative, too tied to
the oil industry and too close to Bush's father.
</P>
<P>
   The generally upbeat day, however, had a down note as former
President Ford, who attended the convention earlier in the week,
was hospitalized after suffering one or two small strokes. The
87-year old Ford was expected to remain in the hospital for several
days but doctors predicted he would fully recover.
</P>
<P>
   Cheney, who served as Ford's chief of staff, sent good wishes to
his ex-boss as he began his acceptance speech.
</P>
<P>
   On the streets of Philadelphia, demonstrations, which had turned
violent the day before, remained peaceful as Bush arrived in the
city and attended a festive Latino rally and later a fund-raiser.
</P>
<P>
   At the convention, delegates continued their nominating roll
call , with the Wyoming delegation delivering the votes necessary
to put Bush over the top.
</P>
<P>
   And the theme of the evening was ``Prosperity with a Purpose,''
an effort by Republicans to showcase their tax proposals, many of
which are opposed by the Clinton administration.
</P>
<P>
   But the evening largely belonged to Cheney, a soft-spoken
Washington insider who last week quit his job as head of the
Dallas-based Halliburton, the world's largest oil field service
company, to join the Bush ticket.
</P>
<P>
   In a sharp departure from Bush's pledge to eliminate attacks on
Democrats at the convention, Cheney offered up a speech replete
with red-meat lines, that included a prediction of the end of the
Clinton-Gore era.
</P>
<P>
   ``That last day is near, '' he said to roars and applause. ``The
wheel has turned and it is time. It is time for them to go.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The time for them to go'' refrain, was the same chant that Al
Gore led Democratic delegates in at their 1992 national convention
in reference to President Bush.
</P>
<P>
   Cheney repeatedly hammered on the integrity theme, pledging that
he and Bush will repair the ethical damage caused by Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   ``On the first hour of the first day he will restore decency and
integrity to the Oval Office,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Cheney made scant mention of his record during six terms as
congressman, a highly conservative one that Democrats have said
provides evidence he is out of the mainstream. Democrats are
currently running television spots in Philadelphia pointing to a
series of votes including his opposition to Head Start, the clean
water act and a resolution calling for the release of South
Africa's anti-apartheid leader Nelson Mandela.
</P>
<P>
   And they have seized on the fact that he was in Bush's Cabinet
as evidence that the candidate's father is really pulling the
strings in his son's campaign.
</P>
<P>
   Cheney was introduced by his wife, Lynne, an outspoken critic of
liberal cultural trends. Referring to one her husband's favorite
pastimes, she said, ``one of the keys to understanding Dick Cheney
is understanding fly fishing. It is not a sport for the impatient.
It is not a sport for chatter boxes.''
</P>
<P>
   Cheney also spoke of her husband's devotion to their two grown
daughters, Elizabeth and Mary, who were also in the arena.
</P>
<P>
   Mary, who is gay, has caused a stir in part because her father
has opposed gay related legislation including allowing gays in the
military. Furthermore, Republican delegates once again endorsed a
party platform that does not endorse legal protections for gays.
</P>
<P>
   A former lesbian-gay corporate relations manager for Coors
Brewing Co., Mary Cheney has taken some time off to help her
father's campaign.
</P>
<P>
   Gay rights is one of the hot button social issues that has
severely divided Republicans over the years.
</P>
<P>
   On Tuesday members of the Texas delegation protested the fact
that an openly gay Congressman Rep. Jim Kolbe, R-Ariz, was allowed
to address the convention by silently praying during his speech.
</P>
<P>
   Cathie Adams, a delegate from Dallas and president of the Texas
Eagle Forum, said she did not want to comment on Mary Cheney's role
in the convention.
</P>
<P>
   But she said, ``I have sadness for the family.''
</P>
<P>
   The third evening of the convention stressed economics, a tricky
theme for the Republicans, who must convince voters in a time of
prosperity that they should reject the status quo.
</P>
<P>
   While tax cuts have long been a central tenet of Republican
economic philosophy, polls show voters less enthused about such
proposals at a time when their stock portfolios and 401K retirement
accounts are reaping rich returns.
</P>
<P>
   Although Bush has proposed a tax cut, since the primaries he
rarely talks about it as a top priority.
</P>
<P>
   However, the Republicans in Congress have pushed through a
series of smaller targeted tax cuts aimed at reducing the burden on
married couples and the families of the deceased that they believe
will sell well with voters. Clinton has threatened to veto the
elimination of the marriage penalty and estate taxes claiming they
will eat up too much of the projected surplus.
</P>
<P>
   At the convention the party featured average voters to highlight
a number of their economic proposals, including a farmer, a small
business owners.
</P>
<P>
   ``First and foremost we believe in tax cuts, ''said retiring
Rep. John Kasich, R-Ohio, who waged a brief campaign for president
last year.
</P>
<P>
   They also touted Bush's plan to revamp the Social Security
system by letting younger people invest a portion of their
retirement taxes in the private market. Democratic presidential
candidate Al Gore has attacked the plan, claiming it would be too
risky and expensive.
</P>
<P>
   And at their daily news conference in Philadelphia, Democrats
trotted out several labor and tax experts, as well as as former
``Golden Girls'' star Rue McLanahan to criticize Bush's retirement
plan and other stands.
</P>
<P>
   They singled out Bush's belief that state's should be able to
opt out of federal minimum wage laws.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is extremism with a smile,''said McLanahan.
</P>
<P>
   Irasema Garza, director of the Women's Bureau at the U.S. Labor
Department and a South Texas native,said Bush seems to be oblivious
to the fact that so many Hispanic women and children are suffering
on the Texas-Mexico border.
</P>
<P>
   Garza urged Hispanics to look beyond what she called ``Brown
Day'' at the convention, where the party spotlighted several Latino
acts and speakers.
</P>
<P>
   ``For God's sake, all they have to do is look at his
record,''she said. ``Forty percent of Latino children live in
poverty. There is no inclusion. We have never been part of that
party.''

<TEXT>
<P>
   PHILADELPHIA _ Just six years ago, when George W. Bush ran for
governor of Texas, even his parents expected him to lose.
</P>
<P>
   It was his younger brother Jeb who held the family's confidence
and aspirations, who had diligently prepared for his bid to become
governor of Florida in 1994. George W., in contrast, had come to
his ambitions haphazardly, and his mother, Barbara, flatly tried to
discourage his seemingly quixotic resolve. Friends and family
members say that the elder Bushes worried that George W. would be
forced to bow again, as he had several times before, to failure.
</P>
<P>
   But that story had a surprise ending: while Jeb lost, George
won. And in the process, George Walker Bush launched himself,
without any grand plan or intricate forethought, on a trajectory
that on Thursday will place him in the spotlight here as the
Republican nominee for president, continuing along what historians
may some day recall as a most remarkable path to the White House.
</P>
<P>
   Bush is almost an accidental candidate, a cocky and cheerful
fellow who drifted through much of his life and who was largely
unknown in America until he assumed his first political office five
and a half years ago. Yet he now leads the polls and will have, if
elected, one of the thinnest resumes in public service of any
president in the last century.
</P>
<P>
   Bush's exceptional trajectory also means that he remains a
riddle wrapped in layers of paradox. It would be too much to
describe him as the Republican Party's blind date, but there still
is a great deal about his beliefs and leadership style _ about the
kind of president he would be _ that remains unknown.
</P>
<P>
   He is a man who sometimes tortures the English language,
puzzling audiences with references to the ``vile'' hemisphere
(instead of ``vital'') and tailpipe ``admissions'' (``emissions''),
and mystifying a group of New Hampshire schoolchildren during
Perseverance Month when he earnestly counseled them, ``You've got
to preserve,'' as if they should all rush out to can tomatoes.
</P>
<P>
   Yet he has a dazzling charm, tremendous social skills, a bold
self-confidence, growing political savvy, great popularity among
the Texans who know him best _ and a past littered with opponents
who underestimated him. Those who have worked with Bush, Democrats
as well as Republicans, mostly say that contrary to all the jokes,
he is smart, shrewd and a quick study.
</P>
<P>
   The paradoxes go on. He is the law-and-order candidate, the
amiable governor who presides over a stream of executions, the
preacher of traditional moral values, the mover behind a convention
that called for giving young people the ``moral strength'' to
resist drugs. And yet he was arrested twice in college for pranks,
and he avoided military service in Vietnam, abused alcohol and
dances around questions in ways that suggest that he used illegal
drugs himself.
</P>
<P>
   He steers a profoundly conservative path. And yet he can startle
lily-white Republican audiences full of stout women in pearls with
sympathetic remarks about Mexican immigrants.
</P>
<P>
   He is the ultimate outsider candidate, dripping with scorn about
the ways of Washington and disdainful of Ivy League institutions,
always deeply proud of his frontier roots in the rattlesnake
country of Midland, Texas. And he is the ultimate insider
candidate, a Yale and Harvard graduate whose Rolodex brims with the
names of corporate and political titans, and blue-blooded enough
that even as a little boy he realized on a visit to his relatives
that his best friend should not have drunk from the fingerbowls.
</P>
<P>
   Like most Republicans, he rejects quotas used for affirmative
action as unfair. Yet he never complained about the fairness of
preferences that in the 1950s helped boys like him get into high
schools like Andover or colleges like Yale, because their fathers
had gone there before. Judging from his high school grades and
college board scores, he almost certainly would not have been
accepted at Yale without his family ties.
</P>
<P>
   Better than virtually any other politician in America today,
Bush reflects Kipling's ideal _ ``If you can talk with crowds and
keep your virtue, or walk with kings _ nor lose the common touch.''
He has already hobnobbed with Queen Elizabeth II and gets along
equally brilliantly with beer-bellied baseball fans; he would be a
gold medalist in small talk if it were an Olympic sport. Yet he is
the scion of one of America's most prominent political families.
</P>
<P>
   (The word ``dynasty'' is taboo around the Bushes, arousing such
annoyance that its mention sometimes turns Bush's charm congealing
into something close to icy fury. But Bush is a direct descendant
of President Franklin Pierce on his mother's side and of a more
recent president on his father's side.)
</P>
<P>
   He is exceptionally casual and unpretentious, sometimes goofy.
When mealtime approached recently on his campaign plane, the flight
attendant handed him a small piping-hot towel, and he did what
passengers typically do, rubbing his fingers and mouth. But then he
unfolded the towel, draped it over his face and leaned toward the
person next to him as if playing peek-a-boo.
</P>
<P>
   Where, oh where, was the Republican presidential candidate?
Hiding beneath a soggy square of terrycloth, as he pursued an
office that embodies gravitas and dignity.
</P>
<P>
   Always quick to lampoon bigwigs, Bush used to entertain friends
with splendidly cruel impressions of some of his father's more
haughty cabinet members. And now this man who delights in deflating
important people may himself become the most important person in
the world.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   BY NATURE, NOT A POLITICAL PERSON &QL;
</P>
<P>
   It is too early to resolve these paradoxes with any certainty,
and Bush, somebody positively allergic to what he dismisses as
``psychobabble,'' is not much help in this. But it may be possible
to venture a few useful clues.
</P>
<P>
   One is that Bush is _ and perhaps always has been _ more of a
``people person'' than a political person. In high school and
college, he always sought to be the center of attention but showed
no interest in political debate. Marlin Fitzwater, who was
President Bush's spokesman, says that in the late 1980s and early
'90s, when he saw the Bush children at the family retreat in
Kennebunkport, Maine, or in Washington, young George was amiable,
but far from political.
</P>
<P>
   ``George W. almost never showed interest in politics or
policy,'' Fitzwater recalled. ``I can't remember us ever talking
about policy, in fact. In those days, he was in the oil business in
Midland, at first, and then involved in baseball, and so we would
talk about that or we'd chat about what was in the newspaper or
about sports.''
</P>
<P>
   Fitzwater added: ``George W. was so apolitical in the way he
approached the presidency and the family that I was shocked when he
ran for governor.''
</P>
<P>
   That may overstate the case. Bush, who was born on July 6, 1946,
has been around politics since he helped his father campaign for
the Senate in 1970 (giving such good pep talks, remembers Anson
Franklin, then an aide to his father, that some people even then
said he was a better speaker than his father). But when he helped
his father run for the Senate, or later for president, he seemed
impelled more by love and loyalty than by passion about the issues.
Friends say that when he ran unsuccessfully for the House of
Representatives in 1978, he was motivated not by deep-seated
ideological convictions but by the thought that it would be cool to
be a congressman.
</P>
<P>
   In adulthood, one of the best ways to be in the spotlight and
get the loudest laughs for your jokes is to be successful in
politics, and Bush has seemingly drifted toward that spotlight less
because of bedrock political beliefs than because he enjoys it and
is good at it. But there is also something more: the pressure to
uphold his family legacy of public service and the expectations it
created.
</P>
<P>
   ``He admired his father tremendously and wanted to live up to
the expectations that his family had for him and for all members,''
recalled Ted Livingston, a roommate at Yale.
</P>
<P>
   This Bush legacy offers another clue to understanding him. Deep
in the family aristocratic tradition there is a commitment to
public service that is easy to mock as a version of the white man's
burden _ a sort of Bushes' burden. One of Bush's early heroes was
his grandfather, Prescott Bush, an impossibly tall, impossibly
severe financier who would have died rather than kiss a baby. Yet
Prescott Bush subjected himself to the indignity of electioneering
to be elected senator. A Republican, he was pragmatic and
nondoctrinaire in much the same way as his grandson, and he became
one of the first senators to denounce Joseph McCarthy.
</P>
<P>
   Herbert S. Parmet, a historian and biographer of President Bush,
said he believed that the younger Bush's political career arose
from that family legacy honoring public service. His political
flexibility, his talk of inclusiveness and his speeches about
``compassionate conservatism'' all reflect Bush family values,
Parmet said.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's easy to ridicule,'' he acknowledged. ``But it comes out
of the family, out of noblesse oblige and all that.''
</P>
<P>
   OPERATING ON INSTINCT RATHER THAN INTELLECT
</P>
<P>
   Another clue is that in place of an ideology, Bush seems to have
something milder and sketchier _ call it instinct. It is not rigid
or deeply partisan, and its essence is to incline toward
pro-business policies, tax cuts and limited government. In recent
years, Bush has fleshed it out a bit more, relying upon right-wing
thinkers and writers like Marvin Olasky and Myron Magnet, who have
written books harshly criticizing 1960s liberalism and the welfare
state. In a note to Magnet, Bush praised him for having ``charged
our intellectual batteries.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, these batteries often seem like AAAs. Bush is
determinedly anti-intellectual, gives little evidence of having
thought out a political philosophy, waffles on many issues and
often jokes about his fondness for reading the executive summary
and skipping the long report. All this means that he is not exactly
a blank slate, but a relatively illegible one.
</P>
<P>
   The famous pop quiz that he flunked last year, about foreign
leaders, may have been silly in some respects, but it perhaps got
at something deeper: this is a man who is often casual about
geopolitical information, and it is another way in which he is an
unusual and sometimes awkward candidate. Bush seems deeply ot of
sync with America's elite, dismissive of its icons and ignorant of
what it regards as essential information.
</P>
<P>
   Left to his own devices, on his campaign plane, Bush talks more
about his pets than his proposals. When heading back home to Austin
after a campaign trip, he talked about his upcoming weekend.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'll be reading policy,'' he declared with an exaggerated and
mock seriousness. Then he grinned and admitted, ``No, I'll probably
take a few naps.''
</P>
<P>
   Yet some of his advisers say that all this places him in greater
touch with the American heartland.
</P>
<P>
   To understand the world around him, Bush reaches first not for
policy papers but for his Bible. He says he reads it every day.
When asked to name his favorite philosopher-thinker, he simply
replied: ``Christ, because he changed my heart.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush does not wear his Methodist faith on his sleeve, does not
thump on his Bible and is reluctant to talk about his views on
evolution _ but his religious beliefs are an important part of who
he is.
</P>
<P>
   If Bush has an ideology, it is personal, not political; it is
simply loyalty. It is a deep loyalty to his father and to friends
who have stood by him and his family. Many of his top aides have
been friends for many years or decades, and loyalty was again a
subtext when Bush chose as his running mate Dick Cheney, the
defense secretary under President Bush. The Texas governor was not
merely going to restore honor and integrity to the White House, as
he pledged in many a stump speech. He was going to reunite the
personnel.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   BENEATH A SIMPLE EXTERIOR, A SKILLFUL POLITICIAN
</P>
<P>
   Bush often seems an echo of Prince Hal, the likable but
dissolute son of King Henry IV in Shakespeare's plays. Hal sobers
up when he inherits the crown as Henry V _ and ultimately becomes a
model leader who is a better ruler for his past wildness. One of
the most interesting questions about Bush is whether he will grow
in the same way.
</P>
<P>
   Certainly there are signs that he has matured. For much of his
life, his awesome people skills were undermined by his volatile
temper, his sharp tongue, his tendency to hold grudges. But when he
ran for governor in 1994, his opponent, Ann Richards, thought it
would be easy to goad him into losing his cool and humiliating
himself; instead he surprised friends and rivals alike with his
steadiness under pressure and a newfound discipline.
</P>
<P>
   That discipline and self-restraint have been evident in a taut
campaign this year, in which Bush kept his temper in check and
relentlessly stayed ``on message.'' After a divisive primary
season, he managed better than many had expected to unite the
Republican Party and get what he wanted in this convention.
</P>
<P>
   Central to this political success is his campaign style. Bush's
years as a farmer of wild oats left him with a down-to-earth manner
that resonates with voters in a way his father's and grandfather's
styles never quite did.
</P>
<P>
   ``I never thought of myself as a bad campaigner,'' President
Bush mused in a recent interview. ``After all, I was elected
president of the United States. And I like people and all. But I
think George is better.''
</P>
<P>
   Friends of the family overwhelmingly second that. Indeed, the
very things that critics often denounce in George W., such as his
anti-intellectualism and uninterest in policy details, come across
to many voters as an unpretentiousness and fundamental likability
that are his greatest political strengths.
</P>
<P>
   One aspect of Bush's personality that irritates his critics and
endears him to his supporters is that he seems to have a mere
human-sized ambition. One sometimes gets the sense that Vice
President Al Gore wanted to be president from second grade; little
Georgie wanted to be a major league baseball player.
</P>
<P>
   Bush has always put a priority on having a good time. Of his
schoolbook Latin, the phrase that he summons from memory is,
characteristically: ``ubi, ubi sububi.'' It is a sophomoric pun,
which he translates as: ``Where, oh where, is your underwear?''
</P>
<P>
   Even now, Bush balances his ambition with his desire for
comfort. It is important to him; he carries his own feather pillow
on the road, goes out of his way to vow that the couches will be
``comfortable'' in the house he is building on his Texas ranch.
</P>
<P>
   ``During the Democrat convention, it's traditional for a
candidate to go out of the news, which I plan to do,'' Bush mused
recently. ``We started thinking about a lot of places to go. I
said, `I want to go to my own place, my own bed, my own house, my
own dog.' So that's what I'm going to do.''
</P>
<P>
   Of course, for most of his life Bush had little reason to be
pretentious. Until the late 1980s, he was simply a struggling
oilman in Texas, albeit the son of the vice president, and his
career took off mostly after he became a part-owner of the Texas
Rangers baseball team in 1989, and then was elected governor of
Texas in 1994.
</P>
<P>
   His name and connections helped him, of course, and without them
it is difficult to imagine that he would be a candidate today (a
proposition that Bush does not really argue with, although he hates
to talk about it).
</P>
<P>
   But Bush's underdog victory as governor did not seem to be a
harbinger at first; ``Bush'' was then a four-letter word in many
Republican circles, a reminder of a president who had broken his
no-new-taxes pledge and surrendered the White House after one term
to those exasperating Clintons.
</P>
<P>
   But then Governor Bush was re-elected in 1998 with an
astonishing 69 percent of the vote, and his fortunes soared. He
became the great Republican hope, the money poured in, and he was
crowned as the presidential front-runner.
</P>
<P>
   There was a bumpy stretch in the primaries after Sen. John
McCain won in New Hampshire, but within six weeks Bush had
recovered his footing. He has been almost constantly ahead of Al
Gore ever since.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps it is this front-runner status, or more likely a trait
ingrained since childhood, but Bush campaigns as an utter stranger
to self-doubt. He seems certain that he will win. One result is
that he reaches out to formidable policy advisers; he does not seem
to worry that he will look ignorant in comparison _ or, more
searchingly, that he should, like them, devote himself more
energetically to understanding the world.
</P>
<P>
   This self-confidence can also breed trouble. He is so sure of
himself, his own good intentions and the prospect that people will
see him as he wants to be seen, that he is often perceived as
arrogant. His confidence can also lead him to stumble.
</P>
<P>
   When he spoke at Bob Jones University in the primary season,
despite its founder's record of anti-Catholic comments and the
school's notorious reputation for racism, he seemed unprepared for
the fallout and taken aback by it. He assumes that he should be
judged inclusive for his willingness to speak to the National
Association for the Advancement of Colored People, rather than
exclusive and insensitive for his speech at Bob Jones.
</P>
<P>
   Likewise, he seemed surprised that people would see his pick of
Cheney, a rich, white relic of his father's administration, as
contradicting his portrayal of himself as a fresh voice, an
outsider, an agent of a new inclusiveness in the Republican Party.
</P>
<P>
   Bush's self-confidence leaves him one of the least neurotic
people on the planet, and also one of the least inclined to examine
himself. He glides along, glibly and optimistically, confident that
his innate cleverness will make up for whatever else he lacks,
deliberately ignoring the slings and arrows of his outrageous good
fortune.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't read half of what you write,'' he told the press corps
on his campaign plane last month, in a bit of pregnant banter
suffused with equal parts defiance and mischievous charm.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't listen to half of what you say,'' one of the
reporters shot back.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's apparent,'' Bush replied, never missing a beat, ``in
the other half of what I read.''

   ANAHEIM, Calif. _ Only 53 games remain in the Angels' 2000
season. Of those, 32 are on the road.
</P>
<P>
   Of the 13 teams the Angels will visit between now and season's
end, eight have winning records.
</P>
<P>
   First, the Angels are off to Cleveland for a three-game series
beginning Friday, and if they're to to make up ground on Oakland in
the American League wild-card race, it's going to be against teams
in the Central Division. The team's record suggests that can be
done _ the Angels are 18-13 against AL Central opponents this
season.
</P>
<P>
   NICKNAMES: There's nothing particularly new about nicknamed
baseball teams. It's a tradition perhaps as old as the game itself.
</P>
<P>
   There was the ``Murderer's Row Yankees'' of 1927; the ``Gashouse
Gang'' Cardinals of the 1930s; the ``Miracle Mets'' in 1969; and
the ``We are Family'' Pirates of 1979.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe the Angels will find their way into that group. Their
penchant for playing close games may deserve some recognition.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, 10 of the club's last 20 games have ended in one-run
decisions. In those games, the team is 5-5 and 23-18 overall _ the
most one-run games in the major leagues.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, 11 of the Angels' 20 games since the All-Star break
have been decided in the seventh inning or later.
</P>
<P>
   In all, the Angels have 27 come-from-behind wins, and 15 of
those came in their final at-bat.
</P>
<P>
   It's not exactly the ideal way to win, although manager Mike
Scioscia thinks it builds character.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't feel comfortable with that, but I have a lot of
confidence in our ability to come back,'' he said. ``It is a grind
though and it does become mentally taxing to try to come back they
way they have time after time. But they keep doing it and meeting
the challenges. But, I'd much rather see them get out in front and
stay in front.'' &QL;

POLITICAL SURFING: AT LAST, SOMETHING TO REPORT
</HEADLINE>
 
(Adds a new four-graph top, changes for transition in fifth graph,
eliminates last paragraph of story. ) By RICK LYMAN

<P>
   Perhaps it was when the musician Kenny Gamble stepped to the
microphone and yelled _ ``Peace, everybody'' _ and then,
dissatisfied with the lackluster response from the Republican
delegates, forcefully added: ``Did you hear me? I said, peace!''
</P>
<P>
   Or perhaps it was when Rep. Joe Scarborough of Florida brought
his rock band, the Regular Joes, to the stage at the Republican
National Convention and warmed up the crowd with a little poetry,
``Unite, not divide, so once again we can look at the White House
with pride.''
</P>
<P>
   Or maybe it was when Fox News tracked down a giddy delegate
wearing a hat that had a live plant on its crown and a slender
chain hanging from the brim along with a four-inch ``E.'' What did
it mean? ``Bush,'' she said, pointing to the plant. ``And chain-E,
Cheney.''
</P>
<P>
   But surely CNN's Bernard Shaw was not alone when he shook his
head with disbelief, asking, ``The Republican convention?''
</P>
<P>
   The cable television reporters and Internet correspondents
seemed energized, if a little startled, by the prospect of actual
news to report from the Republican National Convention. Until
Wednesday, as has been endlessly pointed out, the convention had
been a carefully scripted infomercial punctuated by scattered
protests and pundits on autopilot.
</P>
<P>
   But suddenly there was the disclosure that former President
Gerald R. Ford had gone to the hospital with what was thought to be
a sinus infection but was actually a stroke. That followed the
beginning of a whiff of a semi-controversy about former President
George Bush attacking President Clinton for attacking his son.
</P>
<P>
   The all-news channels and streaming Web sites suddenly had
something to cut back to regularly (correspondents standing outside
the hospital, promising updates on Ford's condition) and a fresh
bone to gnaw on (whether Bush should have kept quiet).
</P>
<P>
   Some news outlets that had done interviews with Ford on Tuesday,
before he was hospitalized, replayed the tapes throughout the
afternoon, so viewers could watch the 87-year-old former president
slurring his words.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, the pundit class was making much of Bush's
remark that he was growing irritated with President Clinton's
attacks on his son. This allowed Democrats and some pundits to
argue that Gov. George W. Bush of Texas apparently needed his daddy
to protect him.
</P>
<P>
   Teapot Dome it was not. But it was about the only spice on the
menu.
</P>
<P>
   Wednesday morning, when President Bush and his wife, Barbara,
appeared on ABC's ``Good Morning, America,'' he waspromising to be
good. ``They're making a federal case about it,'' he said. ``It's
better to say nothing about it, future, now, nothing, period.''
</P>
<P>
   The show's host, Charles Gibson, however, knew raw meat when he
saw it and prodded once more. ``Not going to talk about it,'' Bush
insisted.
</P>
<P>
   Then Mrs. Bush jumped to her husband's aid, saying that his was
not really a personal attack, just an observation about the state
of the presidency.
</P>
<P>
   Again, Gibson detected sirloin. Oh, is there something wrong
with the state of the presidency? Has it been sullied? And who
might have been responsible for that?
</P>
<P>
   ``You know who I mean,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Bush tried to shush his wife. ``They're going to get all over
your case,'' he warned.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't care,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   There they were, working it out, right on live television. It
was like being a fly on the wall in Kennebunkport, Maine.
</P>
<P>
   By the end of the day, though, the pundits seemed to have gnawed
all the meat off the bone. Besides, Governor Bush had finally
arrived in Philadelphia after stalking the convention for three
days, and was himself criticizing Clinton and Vice President Al
Gore.
</P>
<P>
   ``The media is making too much of this,'' a former White House
communications director, Don Bauer, said in response to an e-mail
question on a live ``Talk Back'' segment on CNN. ``They love a
sideshow.''
</P>
<P>
   Speakout.com continued its experiment with MSNBC, offering Web
surfers the opportunity to rate the impact of the major convention
speeches as they were being delivered. Those at home could
manipulate bars on their computer screens as a speech was being
given to indicate whether they agreed or disagreed with the
speaker.
</P>
<P>
   The verdict on Sen. John McCain's speech on Tuesday night was
that men and women liked it much the same. Democrats and
independents were put off by the middle of the speech, when the
senator talked about national pride.
</P>
<P>
   This just in: A live Web cam trained on the convention podium at
2:20 p.m. showed two people standing next to a big plant, talking.
It was too dark to see who they were. Another Web cam, at 3:35
p.m., trained on the main entrance outside showed an empty golf
cart and a man leaning against a chain-link fence. His back was to
the camera, but he was wearing a bright green shirt.
</P>
<P>
   In a column for the CNN Web page, Robert Novak disclosed what
had been the unspoken scandal of this convention, the scarcity of
tickets to key events. Seats that once would have gone to party big
shots were going this year to major donors. The Republican
money-raisers have ``hijacked the party,'' complained the Ohio
Republican chairman, Robert Bennett.
</P>
<P>
   For political junkies, Howard Mortman, national editor for the
Hotline, the Web site produced by the National Journal Group,
continued his series of ``Extreme Mortman'' columns, in which he
makes the convention party scene. He wrote of seeing the pundit Ann
Coulter momentarily resist a television reporter's interview
request before she ``succumbed to the temptations of the forbidden
microphone fruit.''
</P>
<P>
   And Lewis Black, a political humorist reporting for the Comedy
Central cable network, complained in a streaming Web feed that he
and his colleagues had been refused floor credentials and had been
reduced to covering the event from a college dormitory several
miles away.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we had any brains, we could have been on a cruise ship,
watching it on television and sipping cocktails,'' Black said.

NADER LETS HIS FEELINGS KNOWN AT REPUBLICAN CONVENTION 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Fla.)   By ADAM NAGOURNEY   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHILADELPHIA _ It took the presence of Ralph Nader _ consumer
advocate, professional gadfly and himself a candidate for president
of the United States _ but something finally happened here
Wednesday night that, one assumes, was not in the Republican Party
script.
</P>
<P>
   Right in the middle of the presidential roll -call, Nader
charged out on the convention floor, plopped himself in front of
the Florida delegation, and began tearing into the Republican Party
and its candidate for president, George W. Bush.
</P>
<P>
   ``Why am I here?'' Nader asked as he found himself in the midst
of a rolling mosh pit of delegates and reporters. ``I wanted to
observe this thing in action. This is the most specular display of
cash-register politics in the history of our country.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The message,'' he continued, patiently answering questions
from any reporter who had one, ``is to go home and rethink what
they're doing to the country when they sell the political system to
corporate interests.''
</P>
<P>
   As a rule of thumb, Green Party candidates for president of the
United States are not allowed on the tightly guarded floor of the
Republican convention, where everyone _ even elected Republican
leaders _ wear credentials strung around their neck. Nader was
displaying a broadcast media credential, courtesy of a reporter
from WBAI, a Pacifica Radio station in New York, who took him out
on the floor for an interview.
</P>
<P>
   Although polls show that Nader's campaign has cut into support
for Vice President Al Gore, his venture Wednesday night onto the
floor was met with something less than an enthusiastic reaction
from the Florida delegates, who seemed a little shocked to realize
what was going on in front of them. First there were chants of
``Go, Bush! Go, Bush!''
</P>
<P>
   Then, Mel Martinez, a delegate from Orlando, stepped forward to
thrust a Bush-Cheney sign into his hands. Nader courteously thanked
him for the souvenier, and promised to relish it.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, with pedestiran traffic at a complete stop, Al
Cardenas, stepped forward. ``Excuse me, Mr. Nader: I'm the chairman
of the Florida delegation and this is our area,'' he said. He
informed Nader that he would be welcome to join the Republican
Party, but in the meantime, he said, it was time for Nader to go.
And, with a little prodding from other Republican delegates on the
floor, he did.

   Even in death, Bullock's presence will reign
</P>
<P>
   Texas Democratic legend's widow to address GOP convention
</P>
<P>
   By CLAY ROBISON &QL; 
and ALAN BERNSTEIN &QL; 
c. Houston Chronicle
</P>
<P>
   PHILADELPHIA _ In life, Texas legend Bob Bullock haunted the
dreams _ and sometimes the waking hours _ of legislators, lobbyists
and even governors because of his dominant role in the state's
lawmaking process.
</P>
<P>
   Now, the late lieutenant governor's spirit may start to haunt
his longtime political home, the Democratic Party.
</P>
<P>
   If there is a supernatural world, Bullock's specter certainly
will be hovering over the Republican National Convention tonight,
(-- THURSDAY AUG. 3-- ) applauding George W. Bush's leadership
credentials and a friendship that transcended partisanship.
</P>
<P>
   Bullock's widow, Jan, will do the honors. She will speak to
Republican delegates and a national television audience in a salute
to Bush just before he accepts the GOP presidential nomination.
</P>
<P>
   Bush has said that he also will talk about Bullock in his
acceptance speech to bolster his efforts to appeal to Democrats and
independents.
</P>
<P>
   ``I knew Bullock was going to reappear. I just didn't know when
or where,'' state Sen. John Whitmire, D-Houston, quipped in a
telephone interview about tonight's mentions of Bullock.
</P>
<P>
   Whitmire was a key legislative committee chairman who often felt
Bullock's footprint on his backside.
</P>
<P>
   Jan Bullock, still a close friend of Bush and his wife, Laura,
said that her husband, if he were alive, would probably be on the
stage.
</P>
<P>
   ``If the governor had asked him, he would have,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Austin political consultant George Christian, a Democrat who
supports Bush and knew Bullock well, agreed.
</P>
<P>
   But, he added, the lifelong Democrat ``may have had to hold his
nose around some of the (Republican) delegates, though, and they
may have had to hold theirs.''
</P>
<P>
   In her first address to a national political convention, Jan
Bullock said that she will discuss her husband's friendship with
the governor and the ``way they worked so well.''
</P>
<P>
   Bob Bullock, a crusty Democratic veteran of four decades in
Texas politics often did not get along with governors from his own
party.
</P>
<P>
   To the surprise of many in Austin, he and Bush hit it off almost
immediately when the Republican stepped into the governor's office
in 1995. Bullock and Democratic House Speaker Pete Laney were
instrumental in delivering the legislative victories Bush now brags
about in his presidential campaign.
</P>
<P>
   Bullock became a mentor and a personal friend to Bush. And as
early as 1996, Bullock encouraged him to run for president. He said
Bush would make a ``great president.''
</P>
<P>
   Bullock died at age 69 in June 1999, five months after retiring
from office and only a few days after Bush had launched his
national campaign.
</P>
<P>
   In a eulogy, Bush praised the late Texas leader for reaching out
to a ``green governor, across parties and generations.''
</P>
<P>
   Associates of Bush and Bullock say that Bush actually reached
out first, meeting with Bullock several times before the Republican
had won the 1994 gubernatorial election to promise that he would
continue Texas' bipartisan lawmaking tradition.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think that he (Bullock) was first of all intrigued that Bush
was so brash'' and confident of winning the election, said Tony
Proffitt, a longtime Bullock spokesman.
</P>
<P>
   ``I imagine there was a little bit of feeling each other out,''
Christian said, noting that associates of both men were initially
surprised that their relationship developed so well.
</P>
<P>
   ``Bullock was irascible and tough to deal with, but Bush
understood how to work with him,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Some people, Christian added, believe ``that had more to do with
his (Bush's) success as governor than anything.''
</P>
<P>
   To the chagrin of many Democrats, Bullock endorsed Bush for
re-election in 1998 over Democratic challenger Garry Mauro, even
though Mauro had worked for Bullock and Bullock was godfather to
one of Mauro's children.
</P>
<P>
   Texas Democratic Party Chairwoman Molly Beth Malcolm criticized
Bush for resurrecting Bullock's name for political gain.
</P>
<P>
   ``I find it offensive that George Bush doesn't have any problem
continuing to use and embellish a story about a man who can no
longer speak for himself,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Malcolm said that Bullock's backing of Bush was based on
personal relationships, not on politics.
</P>
<P>
   ``Democrats supporting George Bush are an exception. They are a
small minority of the total Democrats in Texas,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Whitmire, said he will vote for Vice President Al Gore, the
likely Democratic nominee, for president. But he said it was fair
game for Bush to use his ties to Bullock to reinforce the message
that he is a uniter.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a very legitimate position to stake out,'' Whitmire said.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can't undo the facts. The political rhetoric is political
rhetoric, but the facts are that Governor Bush had an excellent
relationship with both parties in Texas. Speaker Laney and
(Lieutenant) Governor Bullock worked closely with Bush.
</P>
<P>
   ``I believe it is correct for the Bush people to draw contrasts
from his working relationship in Texas with how the system is run
in Washington, where they barely speak to each other,'' Whitmire
added.
</P>
<P>
   Admitting to some pre-speech nervousness, Jan Bullock said she
was ``really happy to be able to support George and Laura. They're
such extraordinary people.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm pretty independent (politically). I vote for the person,
rather than the party,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   During his first legislative session as lieutenant governor in
1991, Bullock appointed only Democrats to Senate leadership
positions. He started appointing Republicans in 1993, as Republican
strength in the Senate started to grow.
</P>
<P>
   ``By 1993, (Bullock) was compassionate,'' said state Sen.
Florence Shapiro, R-Plano, playing off Bush's campaign theme of
compassionate conservatism. ``You know the old expression _ better
late than never.''

 &HT;    By STEVE LASH 
c. 2000 Houston Chronicle &HT;    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ President Clinton has postponed the federal
execution of a convicted South Texas killer to give him time to
seek a presidential reprieve under new federal clemency guidelines.
</P>
<P>
   Former drug dealer Juan Raul Garza was to be executed Saturday
for three murders committed in the early 1990s while he was a drug
runner. He would have been the first federal prisoner to be
executed since 1963.
</P>
<P>
   Houston attorney Greg Wiercioch said his client was ``obviously
pleased'' with the postponement until Dec. 12 and was reviewing the
new guidelines, issued Wednesday, in preparation for filing a
clemency petition. He will ask Clinton to commute Garza's sentence
to life in prison without a chance for parole.
</P>
<P>
   The presidential postponement was expected. Clinton's spokesman
Jake Siewert said last month that the president planned to delay
Garza's execution in light of the Justice Department's tardiness in
issuing guidelines on death-penalty clemency petitions.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton ordered the department last spring to issue the new
guidelines. He said existing procedures, which had applied to all
federal prisoners, set no firm deadlines for filing clemency
petitions in capital cases.
</P>
<P>
   Such a free-wheeling schedule failed to account for condemned
defendants' special need for quick resolution of their requests due
to their imminent executions, Clinton said.
</P>
<P>
   A federal jury in Brownsville in 1993 convicted Garza, a major
drug dealer in South Texas, of killing three associates to further
his illegal business. He was sentenced to death under the federal
1988 Anti-Drug Abuse Act, which lets prosecutors seek the death
penalty against ``drug kingpins'' who kill as a stock in trade.
</P>
<P>
   The Supreme Court refused to hear Garza's appeal in November
1999.
</P>
<P>
   In his clemency petition, Wiercioch said he anticipates arguing
to the president that Garza's death sentence was unfair in light of
similar federal prosecutions. In those cases, prosecutors did not
seek the death penalty even though the defendants had killed more
people than Garza had, Wiercioch said.
</P>
<P>
   The attorney added that he is awaiting a Justice Department
survey on the ethnic composition of federal death row inmates. The
government's results, expected within the next few weeks, might
enhance his argument that death sentences are sought and meted out
more often against Hispanics, such as Garza, and other minorities,
Wiercioch said.
</P>
<P>
   Garza, who moved more than 7,000 pounds of marijuana through
South Texas from 1982 to 1992, killed Erasmo de la Fuente, whom
Garza blamed for losing a marijuana shipment, and de la Fuente's
associate Gilberto Matos. Following those 1990 slayings, Garza
killed Thomas Albert Rumbo the next year when Rumbo agreed to help
authorities after being caught helping to ship marijuana.
</P>
<P>
   Garza sits on death row in Terre Haute, Ind., one of about 20
condemned federal prisoners, including Oklahoma City bomber Timothy
McVeigh. These prisoners can avail themselves of the new clemency
rules after they exhaust all their court appeals.
</P>
<P>
   The guidelines do not carry the force of law and the president
remains free to disregard them so long as he does not violate a
defendant's constitutional rights.
</P>
<P>
   Under the guidelines, condemned convicts may petition only once
for clemency unless ``exceptional circumstances'' come to light
after the request is filed. Other federal defendants are permitted
to reapply a year after a clemency denial.
</P>
<P>
   The guidelines allow condemned defendants 30 days from the date
their execution is scheduled in which to ask the president to
commute their sentences. The new procedures presume quick action by
the president.
</P>
<P>
   The 30-day clock for Garza will not start until the guidelines
are printed in the Federal Register, the official recorder of U.S.
agency actions. The guidelines' publication is expected soon.
</P>
<P>
   All petitions and supporting documents go first to the Justice
Department's office of pardon attorney, as is the current practice.
</P>
<P>
   In a new provision for capital cases, the defendants' lawyers
may ask to appear before the pardon attorney to plead their cases.
But victims and prosecutors also have an opportunity to testify
before the pardon attorney in opposition to the clemency requests.

COMMENTARY: THE GOP'S CONVENTIONAL WISDOM 
</HEADLINE>
   (SUBS 10th and 11th grafs to reflect Wednesday night's events at
convention)  
 By WILLIAM SAFIRE    
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHILADELPHIA _ The purpose of a political convention used to be
to select a presidential candidate. That ended a generation ago,
but three other purposes remained:
</P>
<P>
   First was to have the party identify what it stood for, as state
leaders and national candidates hammered out internal compromises
on the anvil of the party platform.
</P>
<P>
   Next was to draw a sharp contrast with the policies and
priorities of the other party. The final purpose of a convention,
especially in modern times, has been to enable candidates to
introduce themselves to a national audience. In this vital showcase
of acceptance, the chosen leader is supposed to unify his party
and, with the nation paying attention, smite the political foe and
present his own vision.
</P>
<P>
   But this week we are enduring a non-political political
convention. No contesting views means no news; this leads to less
coverage and diminishing interest. What is politics without the
clash of ideas? What's the use of a great political showcase
without a partisan show?
</P>
<P>
   By vitiating the first two purposes of a convention _ no
internal dissent allowed, and then no external issues clearly drawn
with the opposition _ George W. Bush offers voters in a prosperous
time little compelling reason to switch control of the White House.
That, in turn, undercuts his ability to showcase both what's in his
heart and what's on his mind.
</P>
<P>
   Here is the tactical reason Bush operatives give for repressing
internal GOP dissent: If, for example, the anti-abortion plank had
been amended to make it palatable to most Republican voters,
pro-life absolutists in at least seven states would have triggered
a floor fight. That would have negatively dominated news of the
convention as well as alienated the ``base.'' (By such hardball did
Pat Robertson get his payoff and do the Democrats keep their
powerful gender-gap issue.)
</P>
<P>
   But what of the traditional role of the party out of the White
House in carrying the battle to the Ins?
</P>
<P>
   Again, the tactical, practical reasoning: Voters are turned off
by partisan bickering. Because impeachment was not popular, overt
criticism of any Clinton scandal, from lying under oath to illegal
Asian fund raising, is taboo. The only permitted reference is
oblique: Women speakers talk of ``restoring respect'' or promise
Bush will ``tell the truth,'' allowing alert viewers to impute
dishonor or untruthfulness to the White House incumbent,
whatsisname.
</P>
<P>
   This oratorical delicacy averts the dreaded
``mean-spiritedness,'' which pollsters say is death to a candidate.
And because Pat Buchanan's diatribe at the 1992 Republican
convention declaring cultural war helped elect Bill Clinton,
managers of this convention of consensus continue to overreact,
insisting on only sweetness and light, patriotic fervor and
passion-free compassion.
</P>
<P>
   That's why we saw Colin Powell limit himself to a single
sentence of party irregularity, and watched a wistful John McCain,
in a moving expression of loyalty to country and party, ignore the
campaign finance issue on which he campaigned. It was left to Dick
Cheney to save the day for partisanship _ which he did. By
suppressing internal dissent on the platform and about primary
reform, and by muting vigorous criticism of Democratic policy, the
GOP _ except for Cheney _ drained its 2000 convention of vitality.
</P>
<P>
   My right-wing brethren are loath to knock this. Because Clinton
stole conservatives' clothes on curbing welfare and stole swing
voters' hearts by harping on hope, many approve stealing the
Clinton approach to campaigning.
</P>
<P>
   But touchy-feely, above-the-battle mutual back-patting, so
universally advised by consultants, smacks of smugness, and calls
to mind the candidate atop the wedding cake.
</P>
<P>
   My ideological allies will say I'm a controversialist who needs
a public scrap to sell his wares. (How do they know what's in my
heart?)
</P>
<P>
   Not every expression of outrage at hypocrisy on high is ``the
politics of personal destruction.'' Not every wave of media boredom
is a ``vast conspiracy'' to deny coverage. Not every reminder of
demonstrable lying is ``beating a dead horse.'' Not all
spiritedness is mean-spiritedness.
</P>
<P>
   And if Bush's smiling-in-lockstep strategy backfires, the next
GOP convention may be much livelier.

EDITORIAL: MR. BUSH'S NEXT SPEECH 
</HEADLINE>
   c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The New York Times said in an editorial on Thursday, Aug. 3:
</P>
<P>
   When Gov. George W. Bush addresses the Republican Convention
tonight, in the most important speech of his career, he will face
an oddly difficult challenge of his own making. For four days
Philadelphia has echoed with uplifting talk about diversity,
inclusion, family values and ``compassion.'' On Tuesday night the
vice-presidential nominee, Richard B. Cheney, added a strong dose
of partisan combativeness by turning Vice President Al Gore's 1992
attack line _ ``It's time for them to go'' _ back on the Democrats.
But what is still missing is any discussion of the specific
policies and programs that Bush intends to present to the country.
Even Republican policies that the delegates hold dear _ tax cuts,
distrust of government, privatizing Social Security _ have scarcely
received mention from the podium. Bush's task tonight is to go
beyond broad themes and begin to add some substance to this
campaign.
</P>
<P>
   To be sure, passionate generalities about leaving no child
behind and restoring American military strength are part of an
honorable tradition of political oratory, and it is heartening to
hear a leading Republican emphasize government that cares. But
after four days, one has a right to expect something more
nutritious. One of the few speakers to make a clear policy point in
Philadelphia this week was Gen. Colin Powell, who supported
affirmative action for minorities _ a policy the platform rejects.
Republican opposition to abortion, gun control, campaign finance
reform and the rights of patients to sue health maintenance
organizations are core items on the party's agenda. They have
hardly been mentioned from the podium in Philadelphia.
</P>
<P>
   In shunting aside the party's traditional wedge issues in favor
of pleasing banalities, Bush's political strategists are no doubt
confident in their political judgment. Even the seasoned movement
conservatives who support Bush are withholding their criticism,
apparently certain that hiding their positions in a fog of
generalities is the right way to go this year.
</P>
<P>
   But it should give Republicans some pause that the convention's
television ratings have slipped sharply, perhaps because viewers
have not encountered much in the way of ideas and policies. Cheney,
for his part, did raise the energy level by showing how the
Bush-Cheney ticket will use the attack-by-comparison to tie Gore to
President Clinton and attempt to discredit both. Wheeling out what
will probably be key words of the fall campaign, Cheney called Bush
``a man of principle, a man of honor'' who will ``restore decency
and integrity to the Oval Office.'' He also placed the lightly
experienced Texas governor in a GOP leadership pantheon of Gerald
Ford, Ronald Reagan and George H.W. Bush.
</P>
<P>
   The Cheney performance cut against Bush's assertions that he
does not like attack politics, although he is likely to salt his
own speech tonight with language designed to remind voters of the
Clinton administration's ethical problems. But it is also time for
Bush to begin leveling with Americans on what he plans to do. He
could start by laying out exactly why the economy needs the
proposed 10-year, $1.9 trillion tax cut that would start in 2002
and eat up the federal surplus. It may sound odd to say it, but the
time has come for Republicans to stand up for what they believe. &QL;

   ARLINGTON, Texas _ The Rangers had 13 hits against the Chicago
White Sox last night, and there seemed to be a story behind almost
every one of them.
</P>
<P>
   Not only did the 13 hits support pitcher Rick Helling in a 7-2
victory against the White Sox, but it gave insight into how the
Rangers are coping offensively with the recent loss of Ivan
Rodriguez and David Segui. For a team that just lost its two
leading hitters in the course of nine games, the Rangers are still
scoring runs.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think this team is going to hit, regardless,'' first baseman
Rafael Palmeiro said. ``I really believe that.''
</P>
<P>
   The Rangers finished 5-4 on the homestand, batting .298 and
scoring 57 runs. That's an average of 6.3 runs per game, not bad
for a team that lost Rodriguez in the first inning of the first
game and traded Segui to the Cleveland Indians halfway through the
homestand.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've still got some good hitters on this team,'' catcher Bill
Haselman said. ``If we put together some good at-bats, we're more
than capable of having some big innings and that's what we've been
doing lately.''
</P>
<P>
   The big inning yesterday was a four-run third inning, and once
again Haselman and Gabe Kapler were in the middle of it.
</P>
<P>
   Kapler had a run-scoring double in the third to extend his
hitting streak to 16 games, and he's batting .379 in that stretch.
Haselman, who had a run-scoring single on his way to a 3-for-4
night, is hitting .342 in his past 11 games.
</P>
<P>
   Kapler's double came right after the White Sox walked Palmeiro.
Manager Johnny Oates said, with Rodriguez and Segui gone, one of
the keys to the Rangers' offense in the final two months will be
finding some hitters who can protect Palmeiro. He was walked three
times last night and is on pace to walk a career-high 102 times
this season.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's not getting any pitches to hit right now,'' Oates said.
``He's going to have to be patient, but it's important someone
protect Raffy. He's our big gun.''
</P>
<P>
   Said Kapler: ``I see it as a big challenge. Obviously I don't
care if I'm as hot as a firecracker the rest of the year, teams
would still rather pitch to me than Raffy. But it's still a great
challenge. I just have to harness my anger when I see somebody
pitch around somebody to face me. I don't like it.''
</P>
<P>
   Rusty Greer could also help, and he snapped out a minor slump
with a 3-for-4 effort.
</P>
<P>
   The White Sox didn't pitch around Palmeiro in the seventh, and
he led off with a double against left-handed reliever Kelly Wunsch.
Kapler moved him to third with a grounder and, with the Rangers
leading 4-2, that set up what Oates said was the biggest hit of the
game.
</P>
<P>
   With left-hander Ricky Ledee due up, Oates sent up right-hander
Chad Curtis to pinch hit, and he singled through the drawn-in
infield to make it 5-2.
</P>
<P>
   The at-bat showed two things. One is the Rangers may want to
look at Ledee, but Oates is still going to make every move
necessary to win the game. Second, it showed Curtis, despite not
being happy with less playing time, still has a role to fill.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's a valuable part of the club,'' Oates said. ``I've got a
roster of 25 players, and I'm going to do everything I can to put
everybody in a situation where they can succeed, just like if we
were one game out.''
</P>
<P>
   Said Curtis, ``As long as I'm here, I'm going to do everything I
can to help us win.''
</P>
<P>
   Haselman brought home Curtis with a double to left-center, and
Mike Lamb made it 7-2 with a single to center. Lamb was 2-for-4
last night, raising his average to .297, the highest by a rookie in
the majors this year.
</P>
<P>
   He's part of the reason why the Rangers lead the American League
with a .291 team batting average. Despite all else, they can still
hit.
