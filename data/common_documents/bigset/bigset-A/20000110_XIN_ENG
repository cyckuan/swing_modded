<HEADLINE> Iranian Foreign Minister Meets Britain's Blair in London </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, January 10 (Xinhua) -- Iran's Foreign Minister Kamal
Kharrazi, on a landmark visit in Britain aimed at strengthening
relations between the two nations, met British Prime Minister Tony
Blair here on Monday.
</P>
<P>
Kharrazi, the first Iranian minister to visit Britain since the
1979 Islamic Revolution, held talks with Blair for half an hour at
the prime minister's official residence in Downing Street.
</P>
<P>
"The prime minister was encouraged. He believes Kharrazi's
visit is an important landmark in Iran's reintegration into the
international community," Blair's spokesman told reporters after
the meeting.
</P>
<P>
He said the two leaders "discussed the importance of removing
misunderstandings and past grievances" between the two countries.
</P>
<P>
Kharrazi's visit follows the main breakthrough in the bilateral
ties between Iran and Britain 18 months ago when the two agreed to
compromise over the affair of British writer Salman Rushdie.
</P>
<P>
After late Iranian leader Ayatollah Khomeini issued a death
warrant for the British author of The Satanic Verses in 1989, the
relations between Britain and Iran has turned sour and come to a
standstill.
</P>
<P>
In Late 1998, the Iranian government stated that it has no
intention to do anything to carry the warning out. And the two
countries have recently upgraded their relations to full
ambassadorial level
</P>
<P>
Kharrazi was due to hold detailed talks on Monday afternoon
with Foreign Secretary Robin Cook.
</P>
<P>
"Even where there are differences, and some are very real,it
makes sense to talk about them. We have taken the policy of
engagement at a steady and deliberate pace," a senior Foreign
Office official said before Cook meets Kharrazi.

<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, January 10 (Xinhua) -- Productivity in British
companies is growing at its fastest rate for more than three years,
according to a report released Monday by the Institute of
Management Services.
</P>
<P>
The Institute's index, which measures the rate of change of
productivity across 1,400 manufacturing and service-sector
companies, rose to 56.9 in December last year - the highest figure
since the index began in 1996.
</P>
<P>
Latest official figures from the Office for National Statistics
also showed productivity in the three months to October last year
rising at the rapid annual rate of 5.2 percent.
</P>
<P>
Economists believe the high growth rate of productivity means
that the British economy can expand at a relatively rapid rate
without necessarily triggering rises in inflation.

DAR ES SALAAM, January 10 (Xinhua) -- Tanzanian President
Benjamin Mkapa Monday stressed the need to empower Tanzanians for
self-development through education.
</P>
<P>
Addressing a ceremony for the 30th anniversary of the founding

ignorance and diseases.
</P>
<P>
The center must be sustained because the three "enemies" still
exist in the country today, he said.
</P>
<P>
He said there is need to put even greater emphasis on the
education for self reliance since the new century will be governed
by science and technology.
</P>

"What we must do now is to come up with new ideas and
strategies to ensure this center can address the specific needs of
the 21st century, and to increase efficiency in the delivery of
services," he stressed.
</P>
<P>
Kibaha Education Center was constructed and handed to Tanzania
by the Danish government 30 years ago.

<HEADLINE> EgyptAir Sends Additional Experts to U.S. for Crash Investigation </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, January 10 (Xinhua) -- The Egyptian flag carrier EgyptAir
will send an additional team of experts to New York next week to
join their colleagues in the investigation of last October's
EgyptAir plane crash, EgyptAir chairman Fahim Rayan has said.
</P>
<P>
The EgyptAir Boeing 767 crashed into the sea on October 31
shortly after taking off from New York, the United States, killing
all 217 people aboard.
</P>
<P>
Rayan said the plane "plummeted because of something that
happened in its tail." But he did not say whether it was an
accident or an act of sabotage.
</P>
<P>
He said the Egyptian team now working in the U.S. with American
investigators has rebutted all allegations raised against the plane
crew.
</P>
<P>
Citing leaked information from U.S. investigators, U.S. press
had cast suspicion on the co-pilot Gamil al-Batoti, alleging that
he might have crashed the plane to commit suicide. The unconfirmed
charge has enraged the Egyptians.
</P>
<P>
Some clearance companies have been contracted to ship the
belongings of the victims to Cairo, Rayan added.

<HEADLINE> No Compromise on Golan: Syrian Raido </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAMASCUS, January 10 (Xinhua) -- There will be no compromise on
the Golan Heights and its full return to Syria is unnegotiable,
Damascus Radio said Monday in its political comment.
</P>
<P>
The comment also criticized the Israeli negotiators for
manoeuvering to change the mission of the border demarcation
committee.
</P>
<P>
The committee was formed by the Syrian and Israeli negotiators
to define the borders of June 4, 1967, between the two countries.
The Israeli side tries, according to the radio, to change its
mission to the discussion of the withdrawal from the Golan Heights
under illegitimate pretexts that go against the principles of the
peace process.
</P>
<P>
Since the first day of the second round of the Syrian-Israeli
talks in Shepherdstown, West Verginia, the U.S., the Israeli side
has placed obstacles such as the concentration on the two
committees on security arrangements and normalization of relations
rather than the committees on border demarcation and water, the
radio noted.
</P>
<P>
Israel seeks to divert the talks from the full withdrawal from
Golan Heights, the basic element of the Middle East peace process,
to its security claims, it added.
</P>
<P>
In response, U.S. President Bill Clinton stepped in to help
resume the nogotiations of the four committees simultaneously, the
radio pointed out, adding that the U.S. tabled a "positive work
paper" that could serve, despite some reservations, as a basis for
the talks.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Israeli sources close to the talks asserted that the
current round faces some difficulties that might not hinder the
negotiating process.
</P>
<P>
Despite Clinton's efforts, the talks do not seem to have made
any breakthough, Radio Israel said. It quoted the White House
spokesman as saying that the talks were going on but they were
difficult and complicated.

<HEADLINE> Pro-Israeli Militiaman Killed in South Lebanon </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIRUT, January 8 (Xinhua) -- A member of the pro-Israeli South
Lebanon Army (SLA) was killed Monday in a bomb attack by guerrillas
in south Lebanon, security sources said.
</P>
<P>
The SLA man was killed when a bomb exploded in his post at Tuhra
in the central sector of the Israeli occupied border zone in south
Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
The Iranian-backed Hezbollah, or Party of God, claimed the
responsibility for the attack, saying in a statement that one of
his groups detonated a bomb in the SLA's outpost, killing or
wounding SLA members.
</P>
<P>
This is the first fatality suffered by the militia since the
start of this year. Last year at least 20 militiamen were killed in
south Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
The militia is helping Israeli forces to patrol the security
zone established by the Jewish state in 1985 with a claimed aim to
protect its north from Lebanese guerrillas' cross-border attacks.
</P>
<P>
Hezbollah has been leading a guerrilla war in the south trying
to drive the Israelis and their Lebanese allies out of the country.

<HEADLINE> More Rabies Cases Uncovered in Istanbul </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ANKARA, January 10 (Xinhua) -- Over 95 percent of the rabies
incidents recorded in the first nine months of last year in
Turkey's Marmara and western Black Sea regions took place in
Istanbul, the biggest city of the country.
</P>
<P>
The ratio showed a sharp rise when compared to 88 percent in
1998 and only 10 percent in 1988, Turkish Daily News quoted data
from the Pendik Veterinary Control and Research Institute as saying
Monday.
</P>
<P>
Kaya Demirozu, director of the institute, said this ratio
indicated that the general assumption that rabies is confined to
underdeveloped parts of the country was wrong.
</P>
<P>
Rabies, a disease passing by animal especially dogs' bite and
leading to potential death within a few days, is most often seen in
India, the Middle East, Africa and eastern Europe. Turkey is one of
the countries with the highest rate of rabies incidents involving
humans.
</P>
<P>
Demirozu blamed the increase of rabies cases in Turkey's big
cities for local authorities incapable of controlling stray dogs on
the streets.
</P>
<P>
It was reported that about 300,000 vagrant dogs roamed the
streets of big cities in Turkey. Some people called for local
authorities taking these dogs under control and keeping them in
shelters to prevent possible rabies.
</P>
<P>
Demirozu said it was technically impossible for authorities to
burden the heavy financial costs. "The most effective measure is to
adopt the street dogs and to develop a control mechanism which will
act to ensure that they are looked after properly," he said.
</P>
<P>
He also suggested punitive measures be taken against those who
abandon dogs.

<HEADLINE> New Chairman of German Jewish Community Elected </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>

<P>
BERLIN, January 10 (Xinhua) -- Paul Spiegel,62 years old
businessman from Duesseldorf, was elected Sunday the new chairman
of Germany's Central Council of Jews.
</P>
<P>
Because of the death of former chairman Ignatz Bubis last
August the nine-member executive of the German jewish central
council must choose the new leader of their organization.
</P>
<P>
There are two candidates -- Paul Spiegel and Charlotte
Knobloch, 67, head of Munich's Jewish community.
</P>
<P>
Spiegel won election with 6 to 3. Chancellor Gerhard Schroeder
praised Spiegel for his unremitting efforts for Jews in Germany.
</P>
<P>
At the press conference after election Spiegel said that one
of the most important tasks during his tenure of office is the
integration of jewish immigrants.
</P>
<P>
There are 80,000 Jews living in Germany. The key problem for
Spiegel is still improving relations between Jews and Non-Jews in

<HEADLINE> States Urged to Raise Minimum Age for Recruitment, Participation in Conflict </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, January 10 (Xinhua) -- Special Representative
of the U.N. Secretary-General for Children and Armed Conflict,
Olara A. Otunnu, on Monday urged States to raise minimum age for
recruitment and participation in conflict from 15 to 18 years.
</P>
<P>
The statement was made on the occasion of the final session of
the United Nations Working Group on the Draft Optional Protocol to
the Convention on the Rights of the Child held from January 10 to
21 in Geneva.
</P>
<P>
"I appeal to all states to co-operate actively in current
efforts to bring the work on the draft optional protocol to a
successful conclusion. I urge the establishment of 18 as the
minimum age for both recruitment -- voluntary or compulsory -- and
participate in armed conflict," Otunnu said.
</P>
<P>
"The age limit must apply both to Government and non-State
entities and for both international and internal armed conflicts,"
the Special Representative said.
</P>
<P>
"Such a decision would be consistent with many recent
development in the campaign to secure the protection, right and
welfare of children in the context of armed conflict," he added.
</P>
<P>
It is estimated that there are currently 300,000 young persons
under the age of 18 -- some as young as seven or eight, girls as
well as boys -- taking part in hostilities around the world.

<HEADLINE> Putin's Popularity Continues Soaring in Polls </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, January 10 (Xinhua) -- Russian Acting President
Vladimir Putin's popularity has soared to 56 percent, according to
results of a recent opinion poll released Monday.
</P>
<P>
If the presidential elections were held on January 4, the date
when the poll was conducted by the All-Russia Center for Public
Opinion Studies (VTsIOM), Putin, who has already announced his bid
to join the race, would win an overwhelming 56 percent of the
votes, the Interfax news agency reported.
</P>
<P>
The poll, which involved 1,600 respondents, has a margin of
error of 4 percent.
</P>
<P>
It represented a seven-percentage point increase in comparison
with the previous poll taken on December 27, three days before
Boris Yeltsin's abrupt announcement of his early retirement as
head of state.
</P>
<P>
The step-down was seen as an attempt to further boost Putin's
chances of winning the presidential balloting, which has been
moved up from June 4 to March 26.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the ratings of Communist leader Gennady Zyuganov
have dropped from 19 percent to 14 percent in the same period,
while those of former Prime Minister Yevgeny Primakov have edged
up one point to 10 percent, Interfax said.
</P>
<P>
Liberal Yabloko party leader Grigory Yavlinsky's ratings have
remained steady at 3 percent, according to the VTsIOM.

<HEADLINE> Iraq Accuses U.S. for Blocking Approval of Goods Contracts </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, January 10 (Xinhua) -- Iraq on Monday accused
the United States of putting on hold contracts for the export to
Iraq of humanitarian goods with the use of flimsy pretexts..
</P>
<P>
In a letter to the United Nations, Iraq's Permanent
Representative to the U.N., Saeed Hasan said with the support of
the United Kingdom, the United States of America continues to
obstruct implementation of the memorandum of understanding and the
oil-for-food programme using a number of illegal stratagems,
including abuses of its membership of the Security Council
Sanctions Committee.
</P>
<P>
"As at 30 December 1999, the number of contracts on hold was
778, with a total value of $1.27 billion," Hasan said.
</P>
<P>
"When putting contracts on hold, the United States usually
claims that there is insufficient information in the contracts or
that the materials are dual-use. These claims are invalid and
amount to interference in the concerns of the Secretariat and the
Office of the Iraq Programme," Hasan said.
</P>
<P>
"It is clear from the foregoing that the Secretariat is
responsible for ensuring that the contracts submitted meet the
Committee's procedural requirements and are consistent with the
distribution plan. The Secretariat is also responsible for
monitoring the arrival and distribution of humanitarian goods in
Iraq," Hasan said.
</P>
<P>
"Nevertheless, the representative of the United States ignores
the responsibility for the Secretariat, just as he ignores the
distribution plan approved by the Secretary-General, and subjects
each contract to his own particular scrutiny," he said.
</P>
<P>
"The attitude reflects the superficial manner of thinking that
leads to such situations as this and indicates that the United
States has no objective standards for civilized international
relations," he added.
</P>
<P>
The oil-for-food programme began to be implemented in late
1996 and is aimed to ease the humanitarian crisis in Iraq caused
the U.N. sanctions which has been in place since Iraq's invasion
of Kuwait in 1990.

<HEADLINE> Syrian-Israeli Negotiations Move Toward Recess without Result </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
U.S. State Department spokesman James Rubin announced that the
peace talks were moving toward a recess.
</P>
<P>
It was not immediately clear when or where the talks, which
began a week ago, would resume. However, Rubin said Israeli Prime
Minister Ehud Barak and Syrian Foreign Minister Faruk Shareh were
likely to meet again "sooner rather than later."
</P>
<P>
Nothing has been agreed upon during the week-long talks as
Syrians and Israelis were entangled in their differences over
whether an Israeli withdrawal from the Golan Heights or the
security arrangement was first discussed in their negotiations.
</P>
<P>
Barak planned to return home later on Monday and Shareh was
expected to leave thereafter.
</P>
<P>
There had been speculation during the weekend that Barak and
Shareh would leave lower-level officials behind to hammer out
details of a future accord, but U.S. officials said that
substantive differences still need to be overcome.
</P>
<P>
U.S. Secretary of State Madeleine Albright, who has stayed the
whole week in Shepherdstown for mediation, met with Barak earlier
on Monday, then was holding talks with Shareh. Clinton decided on
Monday not to return here after his failure on Sunday night to
rescue the dead-locked talks.
</P>
<P>
Clinton said on Monday that there still existed "great tension"
between Syria and Israel.
</P>
<P>
"This will be a time of great tension where all people will
have to search for wisdom and understanding, where there will be
great reluctance to open the closed fist and walk out into a new
era," he told a White House ceremony marking the end of Ramadan,
the Muslim holy month of fasting.
</P>
<P>
A source close to the Syrian delegation said the issue of the
demarcation of borders remained a sticking point, with Syrians
insisting that Israel pull back to the June 4, 1967 border on the
eve of the Middle East war.
</P>
<P>
But Israel has yet to reveal its intention of how much land it
would cede to Syrian. Instead, it asked first of all for security
arrangement before it considers the pull back.

<HEADLINE> Zimbabwe Tries Best To Promote Export </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, January 10 (Xinhua) -- Zimbabwe's export promotion
body, Zimtrade, will concentrate its efforts on assisting local
companies this year to increase production and to meet the demand
of larger foreign markets, Zimbabwe News Agency reported Monday.
</P>
<P>
Zimtrade's assistant Chief Executive John Mangudya was quoted
as saying that low production level of the local companies is the
main prohibitive factor to exporting.
</P>
<P>
He noted that most foreign markets, especially those in the
developed countries, require large quantities of goods which the
local companies can not satisfy.
</P>
<P>
Zimtrade would therefore explore possibilities of producing
cheap finance as it is one of the main factors necessary to
increase production levels, he said.
</P>
<P>
According to Mangudya, although Zimtrade introduced several
schemes and concepts which included the matching grant scheme and
bonded warehouses in 1999, these were yet to be fully utilized by
exporters.

<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, January 10 (Xinhua) -- Zimbabwe Monday formed a
steering committee to assist the Electoral Supervisory Commission
(ESC) in supervising and monitoring the voter registration
exercise.
</P>
<P>
Zimbabwe will hold its parliamentary elections in March this
year.
</P>
<P>
The committee comprising political parties and civic
organizations was set up following criticism by the opposition
political parties and some civic organizations saying that the
process would not be free and fair if it is conducted by the
Registrar-General's Office.
</P>
<P>
The decision to form the steering committee was reached last
Thursday after a meeting between the opposition political parties,
the ESC and Home Affairs Minister Dumiso Dabengwa.
</P>
<P>
According to ESC Chairman Peter Hatendi, about 4,000 monitors
are required countrywide for the exercise.
</P>
<P>
The major problem is lack of adequate resources to enable
monitors to supervise or monitor the voter registration exercise,
which is to start on Saturday, he said.
</P>
<P>
Some representatives from the civic organizations demanded a
vice chairman for the steering committee to be chosen among the
political parties so that the committee can not stifle them since
they are stakeholders.

<HEADLINE> Angola to Host Women's National Championship </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUANDA, January 10 (Xinhua) -- Angola's war-torn central city
of Huambo will host on January 30 the 11th women's national
championship, the Angolan Basketball Federation announced on
Monday.
</P>
<P>
It will be the first national tournament to be held in the
central highland since the Angolan government troops gained a
great military victory in the area, said Secretary General of the
federation Albino Figueiredo.
</P>
<P>
Huambo was confirmed as the host after an on-the-spot
investigation of the conditions and preparations, he said, noting
that he is confident that Huambo can successfully lodge the
national tournament.
</P>
<P>
Huambo, the second largest city of Angola with a population of
800,000, was the main target for attack for both the government
troops and the rebels in the over-25-year civil conflict and
suffered the most brutal destruction.
</P>
<P>
The city was for a long time besieged by troops and guns.
Everyday, thousands of bombs exploded in the center of the city,
destroying most of the buildings and streets.
</P>
<P>
Currently there are some 180,000 displaced persons living in
the city, in dire need for food and other necessities of life.
</P>
<P>
In early 1990s, Huambo has been the political capital of the
rebel National Union for the Total Independence of Angola.
</P>
<P>
Basketball is very popular in Angola. The country's men's
basketball team is one of the strongest teams in the African
continent and won the African Championship in August, 1999.

<HEADLINE> Israel Not Present Proposal on Borders to Syria: FM </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, January 10 (Xinhua) -- Israel did not present
proposals on borders to the Syrians during the current Israeli-
Syrian peace talks in the United States, Israeli Foreign Minister
David Levy said Monday.
</P>
<P>
Upon his return from the talks in the U.S., Levy told reporters
at the Ben Gurion International Airport that the two sides at the
peace talks in Shepherdstown, West Virginia, only presented their
positions on key issues to be discussed and no decisions have been
made so far.
</P>
<P>
But the peace talks, which started last Monday, have built up
confidence for both sides and have laid a solid foundation for the
two sides to strike a peace deal in a short time, he said.
</P>
<P>
He rejected the reports on Sunday by London-based Al-Hayat
newspaper that Prime Minister Ehud Barak has proposed to Syria on
the border issue, indicating Israel is ready to withdraw from the
Golan Heights to the international border of 1923 demarcated by
French and British mandate, which would mean a full Israeli
withdrawal.
</P>
<P>
The border issue will be discussed in the later stage of the
peace talks and Israel insisted that normalization of ties, water
rights and security arrangement be solve first, he said.
</P>
<P>
He added that the London-based Arabic-language newspaper's
report about the content of the "working document" was also
inaccurate.
</P>
<P>
Al-Hayat on Sunday published in details about the "working
document" presented to the two negotiating teams by U.S. President
Bill Clinton which summarized positions of both sides on key issues
and suggested the U.S. ideas for their settlement.
</P>
<P>
The next round of talks should be held soon, the Israeli
minister said.
</P>
<P>
Levy returned home earlier than the other members of the Israeli
delegation due to his planned visit to Morocco this week.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Israeli opposition parties urged again on Monday that
Barak should present to the public about the peace talks as soon as
he returns home.
</P>
<P>
During the talks, the two sides have to solve the issues on
water, security arrangements, borders, normalization of ties,
before striking a peace treaty.
</P>
<P>
Syria and Israel held their first highest-level meetings last
December in Washington after a 45-month break.
</P>
<P>
Both sides agreed to continue their talks for possible
agreements on the several issues, the most important of which is
the Golan Heights, snatched by Israel in the 1967 Middle East war.

<HEADLINE> Iran Cuts Down Costs of Major Gas Project </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, January 10 (Xinhua) -- Iran said on Monday that it has
successfully cut down by 20 percent the cost of the 2-billion-U.S.
dollar gas project of South Pars in the Gulf.
</P>
<P>
Managing Director of South Pars Oil and Gas Company Asadollah
Salehi-Foruz said the cost of the project has dropped to 1.6
billion dollars.
</P>
<P>
The National Iranian Oil Company (NIOC) signed an agreement in
October 1998 with an international consortium comprising Total SA
of France, Gazprom of Russia and Petronas of Malaysia over the
project.
</P>
<P>
The agreement was concluded in defiance of the 1995 United
States sanction threat which bans investment of more than 20
million dollars in Iran's energy sector.
</P>
<P>
Salehi-Foruz said that under the agreement, Iranian companies
undertook to carry out 30 percent of the project and signed a 600-
million-dollar agreement with the main partner Total to do the job,
the Islamic Republic News Agency reported.
</P>
<P>
He said that Petronas is now carrying out the first stage of the
project except for the digging of 12 wells, for which an Iranian
company is responsible.
</P>
<P>
The consortium of Total, Gazprom and Petronas is expected to
carry out the second and third stages.
</P>
<P>
The gas field will be operational by October 2001, he added.

<P>
In his speech to the open Security Council session on AIDS in

degradation, ethnic conflicts, bad or inadequate governance,
widespread violations of human rights.
</P>
<P>
The new challenges also cover illiteracy and ill health, the
growing problem of inequality both within and between states,
Annan said, "And, above all, the exclusion of many of the world's
people from the benefits of globalization, whereby nearly half the
human race is condemned to remain in lingering, stubborn poverty."
</P>
<P>
"No part of the world is exempt from these problems," he said.
"But Africa, it seems, has more than its share."
</P>
<P>
"Of the 48 least developed countries in the world, 33 are in
Africa," he said. "Out of two dozen or more conflicts raging
around the world, roughly half are in Africa."
</P>
<P>
"Fifteen sub-Saharan African countries are currently faced with
exceptional food emergencies," he said. "In the Democratic
Republic of Congo alone, over 10 million people's food supplies
are threatened by civil strife."
</P>
<P>
"And out of 11 million orphans so far left by the global
epidemic, 90 percent are African children," he said.

<TEXT>
<P>
Annan, who delivered his speech to an open Security Council
session on AIDS in Africa, said, "Not that AIDS is a purely
African problem. There are many countries outside Africa,
especially in Asia and Eastern Europe, where it is spreading at an
alarming rate."
</P>
<P>
"But nowhere else has AIDS yet become a threat to economic,
social and political stability on the scale that it now is in
southern and eastern Africa," he said. "The impact of AIDS in that
region is no less destructive than that of warfare itself."
</P>
<P>
"Indeed, by some measure it is far worse," he said, adding that
last year, "AIDS killed about 10 times more people in Africa than
did armed conflict."
</P>
<P>
"By overwhelming the continent's health services, by creating
millions of orphans, and by decimating health workers and teachers,
AIDS is causing social and economic crises which in turn threaten
political stability."
</P>
<P>
"HIV/AIDS is not only an African problem," he said. "It is
global and must be recognized as such. But within that
international obligation the fight against AIDS in Africa is an
immediate priority, which must be part and parcel of our work for
peace and security in that continent."
</P>
<P>
A month ago, the United Nations held the first high-level
meeting of African governments and U.N. agencies directly involved
in the fight against AIDS, along with donor governments, private
corporations and non-governmental organizations.
</P>
<P>
At the meeting, Annan called on international community to
formulate, by next May, a response commensurate with the scale of
the crisis.

<HEADLINE> UNDP Calls for Three-Front War Against AIDS </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Mark Brown, administrator of UNDP, told the open Security
Council session that over the final years of the last century, the
international community has "woefully neglected the new causes of
conflict."
</P>
<P>
"View this as a three-front war: the classrooms and clinics of
Africa, the families of Africa; and third, international action --
the critical support needed to back Africa's frontline," he said.
</P>
<P>
"An extraordinary depletion of the region's human capital is
underway," he said. "There are estimates that the number of active
doctors and teachers in the most affected countries could be
reduced by up to a third in the coming years," he said.
</P>
<P>
"Yet schools and clinics are not only at the heart of any
defensive strategy for dealing with the consequences of the
epidemic, they spearhead the offensive for cultural and behavioral
change," he said.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Brown suggested the 15-nation Security Council,
which has the primary responsibility for the maintenance of the
world peace and security, support Africa's frontline efforts to
combat the disease, promote inter-country cooperation, increase
resources and coordinate response to boost the efforts to fight
against AIDS.

<HEADLINE> AIDS and HIV Are Twin Evils, UNAIDS Leader Says </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Speaking to the open session of the U.N. Security Council, Piot
said, "Conflict and HIV are entangled as twin evils."
</P>
<P>
In one study, 17 percent of raped women, previously negative,
became sero-positive, he said. "Refugee men and particularly women,
become highly vulnerable to HIV infection."
</P>
<P>
"Indeed, another study showed that refugee women were six times
more likely to become infected in camps than the outside
population," he said.
</P>
<P>
As a consequence, AIDS also imposed negative impact on economic
and social development in Africa, he said. "Visibly, the epidemic
is eroding the social fabric of many communities; but the long-
term macro impact -- the systemic damage to the political and
economic fabric of Africa -- are still evolving."
</P>
<P>
Over the last year, many African leaders have spoken out in
unprecedented ways, breaking the silence and the stigma of the
epidemic, he said. "The challenge is formidable."
</P>
<P>
Over the last year, African governments, the United Nations,
international donors, civil society and the private sector have
come together to form a new international partnership against AIDS
in Africa, he said.
</P>
<P>
Last month, the U.N. Secretary-Generel, Kofi Annan, asked
UNAIDS and other relevant U.N. agencies to formulate a response
commensurate with the epidemic.

terrorism, which is aimed at cutting financial support to groups
and individuals engaged in terrorism.
</P>
<P>
The convention was proposed by France after the 1998 attacks
against the U.S. embassies in Nairobi and Dar es Salaam.
</P>
<P>
The French ambassador to the United Nations Alain Dejammet
signed the convention, which is also expected to be adopted by the
United States, Britain, the Netherlands, Finland and Sri Lanka,
reported Agence France-Presse.
</P>
<P>
An approval by 22 countries is needed to put into force the
convention, which has already been endorsed by the U.N. General
Assembly.
</P>
<P>
The convention will add to a number of other U.N. anti-
terrorist conventions, including those against hijacking, hostage-
taking, and bomb attacks.
</P>
<P>
It calls for judicial cooperation between different states in
lifting banking secrets and even confiscating money for
compensating the victims of terrorism.

<HEADLINE> French Truckers to Continue Imposing Road Blockade </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, January 10 (Xinhua) -- The employers of France's
trucking companies announced on Monday they will continue imposing
blockade on entry points at the frontier to protest the 35 hour
work week law and rise of oil and gas prices.
</P>
<P>
Agence France-Presse quoted a spokesman of the National
Federation of Road Transport as saying that the decision was made
at ``a meeting of crisis'' of four unions of employers of trucking
companies.
</P>
<P>
Truckers established on Monday about 50 blockade points at the
land and maritime frontier with other European countries.
</P>
<P>
Some 2,000 lorries were mobilized by the employers to ban
foreign trucks from entering France while ordinary vehicles were
allowed free circulation.
</P>
<P>
The blockade has triggered a wave of protest from truckers of
other countries such as Britain, who were virtually taken hostage
by French truckers who staged blockade in nearly every winter
season over the past several years.

<HEADLINE> UN Committee Meets on Child Rights Protection </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GENEVA, January 10 (Xinhua) -- The United Nations Committee on
the Rights of the Child began a three-week meeting here Monday
with the promotion and protection of children's rights in eight
countries at the top of the agenda, according to the United
Nations Office at Geneva (UNOG).
</P>
<P>
During the meeting on January 10-28, independent experts will
examine reports of India, Sierra Leone, Costa Rica, the former
Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia, South Africa, Armenia, Peru, and
Grenada, said the UNOG.
</P>
<P>
The committee was formed in 1991 to monitor the implementation
of the Convention on the Rights of the Child, the most complete
statement of children's rights ever made and the first to give
these rights the force of international law.
</P>
<P>
The countries to attend this session are among the 191 to have
ratified or acceded to the Convention, a number that makes the
treaty the most widely accepted human rights instrument ever. Only
Somalia and the United States have not yet ratified it.
</P>
<P>
During this three-week session, the committee may also pursue
the elaboration of general comments based on the various
principles and provisions of the Convention. It is expected to
pursue its discussion of ways and areas in which existing
cooperation with various relevant bodies could be further
strengthened to enhance the promotion and protection of the rights
of the child.
</P>
<P>
The panel will also discuss the organization of its future work,
as well as the procedure to be followed in the consideration of
reports by States parties.

<HEADLINE> Swiss Say Goodbye to Boeing 747 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GENEVA, January 10 (Xinhua) -- Swissair's only Boeing 747 Jumbo
Jet in service landed at Zurich's Kloten airport Monday, marking
the end of an era in Swiss aviation history.
</P>
<P>
A large crowd turned out at Kloten to witness the landing of
the last 747 to carry Switzerland's national flag, which took off
from the American city.
</P>
<P>
Swissair plans to replace the 747s with Airbus 340s within two
years.
</P>
<P>
The 747 revolutionized intercontinental travel in the 1970s
with its unmatched combination of size and range, giving it the
lowest operating costs in the industry. The aircraft carries up to
350 passengers and set a number of records for non-stop flights.
The 747 became a favorite of airlines and passengers alike.
</P>
<P>
Swissair decided to acquire the aircraft in 1967, and the first
Swissair 747 went into service in 1971. Over the years,
Switzerland's national carrier acquired seven jumbos, spending
about one billion U.S. dollars.

to improve bilateral relations.
</P>
<P>
The prisoners were released and handed over to officials with

backing rebels on their respective lands.
</P>
<P>
Under the peace agreement, both countries would halt hostility
by stopping backing each other's rebels and restoring full
diplomatic relations. And they have decided to send ambassadors
to each other's capital cities by the end of February.

KAMPALA, January 10 (Xinhua) -- Danish Foreign Minister Niels
Helveg Petersen arrived here Monday morning for a five-day visit
to Uganda.
</P>
<P>
An official with the Danish Embassy to Uganda who preferred
anonymity said: "Our foreign minister is expected to hold talks
with President Yoweri Museveni on Friday, but the timing is not
yet confirmed."
</P>
<P>
The official, however, did not disclose the purpose of this

</P>
<P>
Besides, Petersen is also expected to meet with Ugandan Prime
Minister Apolo Nsibambi and House Speaker Francis Ayume.
</P>

During his stay in Uganda, the minister will visit
Denmark-funded projects, National Medical Stores and the AIDS

</P>
<P>
Denmark is one of the key donors in Uganda. Its assistance to
the African country during 1999 amounted to 55 million U.S.
dollars. The assistance was channelled in sectors like health,
agriculture, roads, water, sanitation as well as governance and
democratization process.

<HEADLINE> Zimbabwe's Mineral Production Down </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, January 10 (Xinhua) -- Zimbabwe's mineral production
fell by six percent in the year to May 1999 due to depressed
mineral prices on the international markets, a major finance
institution has said.
</P>
<P>
The depressed markets have led to the closure of a number of
mines in Zimbabwe and the loss of thousands of jobs, said Finhold
in its 1999 group annual report released here on Monday.
</P>
<P>
However, the institution said that notwithstanding the six
percent fall in output, the total value of minerals produced
during the period under review rose substantially, largely due to
the depreciation of the Zimbabwean dollar.
</P>
<P>
The mining sector contributes nearly eight percent to the
country's Gross Domestic Product and provides about 35 percent of
the foreign currency earnings.

<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, January 10 (Xinhua) -- The Joint Military Commission
(JMC), tasked with monitoring the fragile Democratic Republic of
the Congo (DRC) peace process, faces serious financial constraints
to carry out its duties.
</P>
<P>
Zimbabwean Vice President Simon Muzenda made the remarks on
Monday at a meeting with visiting Japanese envoy Tetsuro Yano.
</P>
<P>
"The problem we have with the DRC is funds for the JMC. We have
 difficulties in trying to get proper funds to get the commission
working in full," he said.
</P>
<P>
However, Yano, member of the House of Councilors and chairman
of the Committee on Foreign Affairs and Defense, said: "I think it
will be difficult to help you on the issue you raised of funding
for the JMC."
</P>
<P>
The JMC has been holding meeting lately to craft a solution to
the shaky cease-fire which has been violated several times.
</P>
<P>
The war broke out in the DRC in August 1998 after a rebel
movement backed by Uganda and Rwanda tried to oust President of
the DRC Laurent Kabila.

BONN, January 10 (Xinhua) -- BMW and the Williams racing team
Monday officially unveiled their Formula One car for the coming
season while saying an unnamed main sponsor had finally been
signed, according to reports from Munich.
</P>
<P>
The sleek car driven onto the stage bore BMW's colors of white
with blue racing stripes and marked the return of the German auto
manufacturer to the circuit after a 12-year absence.
</P>
<P>
But the new livery wasn't emblazoned with the logo of a main
sponsor, leaving the Williams team boss to squash the ongoing
reports the team faced a 40 million U.S. dollars budget gap.
</P>
<P>
Frank Williams said the new sponsor would be announced in
Barcelona at the end of January.
</P>
<P>
Williams said BMW-Williams hadn't settled on a second driver
behind two-time world champion Michael Schumacher's younger
brother, Rolf. The team is still negotiating with last year's
driver, Alex Zanardi, while testing two young drivers.
</P>
<P>
BMW will have its latest engine, the FW 22-B, installed in time
for test runs at Barcelona. But Schumacher, who drove a Super-Tec
from Renault last year, already was high on the engine.

<HEADLINE> Extensive Agricultural Reforms Necessary: Turkish President </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ANKARA, January 10 (Xinhua) -- Turkish President Suleyman
Demirel said Monday that Turkey must carry out "extensive" reforms
in its agriculture during its integration process with the European
Union.
</P>
<P>
Demirel said that "we must drop the population of people who
make their living on agriculture to the level of developed
countries," the Anatolia News Agency reported.
</P>
<P>
At present, agriculture occupies a very little share of national
income in Turkey even though almost half of its population lives
off the sector, a high rate compared with the figure of only 8
percent in the EU.
</P>
<P>
The president said that "when compared to the EU, it is clear
that agricultural employment rate is too high and productivity is
too low in Turkey."
</P>
<P>
He stressed that Turkey must face the problem and solve it
through industrialization, adding that the country must lay down
new regulations to livestock breeding and other agricultural
policies.
</P>
<P>
Turkey was accepted as the EU candidacy to a full membership at
the EU Helsinki summit last December and has committed itself to
overall reforms in political, economic and social fields to meet
the required EU standards.

The two presidents held a meeting, which was also attended by
Turkish Foreign Minister Ismail Cem, reported the Anatolia News
Agency. But no statement was issued about the meeting.
</P>
<P>
Aliyev also met with Turkish Chief of General Staff, Huseyin

</P>
<P>
The meeting was closed to the press. During the day, Aliyev went
to Gulhane Military Medicine Academy to have a health check-up.
</P>
<P>
Turkey has forged close political and economic ties with the
Caucasian country since it became independent as a result of the
collapse of the former Soviet Union a decade ago.
</P>
<P>
To meet its rising energy demand, Turkey will have to import
huge volumes of oil and natural gas form the oil- and gas-rich
Caspian states. 
</P>
<P>
Turkey, Georgia and Azerbaijan signed an agreement in Istanbul
last November to establish a 1,730-kilometer pipeline running from
Azerbaijani capital of Baku to Turkey's Mediterranean port city of
Ceyhan.
</P>
<P>
The 2.4-billion-U.S.-dollar project is expected to be completed
in the year 2004.

The meeting, chaired by U.S. Vice President Al Gore whose
country is holding the Security Council presidency for the month
of January, touched upon "the situation in Africa: the impacts of
AIDS on peace and security in Africa."
</P>
<P>
U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan, who has been attaching great
importance to peace and development on the African continent since
he assumed office in 1997, is expected to deliver a speech at the
Council meeting.
</P>
<P>
"The Secretary-General will welcome the emphasis given to
African problems by the Security Council at the start of the new
millennium, and particularly the fact that its first meeting is
devoted to the problem of AIDS in Africa, which was already the
subject of a high-level meeting in December between African
governments, U.N. agencies, donor governments, private
corporations and NGOs (non-governmental organizations)," U.N.
spokesman Fred Eckhard said.
</P>
<P>
The meeting also marked the first time for the five new non-
permanent Security Council members to attend the Council meeting
since they were elected by the 188-member General Assembly in
October last year.
</P>

Bangladesh, Jamaica, Mali, Tunisia and Ukraine joined the 15-

<P>
In sub-Saharan Africa, still the global epicenter of the AIDS
disease, new evidence shows clearly for the first time that women
infected with HIV, the virus that causes AIDS, outnumber men.
</P>
<P>
Fifty-five percent of infected adults in sub-Saharan African
are women, which means more than six HIV-positive women for every
five HIV-positive men, UNAIDS, the U.N. agency on AIDS, said late
last year.
</P>
<P>
Studies in several countries have found that African girls aged
15-19 are five to six times more likely to be HIV-positive than

<P>
HARARE, January 10 (Xinhua) -- Zimbabwean President Robert
Mugabe has accepted an invitation to attend a week-long session of
the United Nations Security Council aimed at bringing peace to the
Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC).
</P>
<P>
Mugabe told reporters here on Monday after a two-hour meeting
with DRC President Laurent Kabila that he would be attending the
session where several issues, such as lack of resources, the delay
in deployment of peacekeepers to the DRC and the U.N.'s attitude
toward African conflicts as compared to its response in other
parts of the world, will be discussed.
</P>
<P>
Zimbabwe, DRC, Angola, Namibia, Uganda, Rwanda and Zambia were
invited to attend the special session, which will be held in New
York on January 24-28.
</P>
<P>
Mugabe said, "We will discuss issues that include the lack of
resources, the delay in implementing of the resolution to deploy
peacekeepers. The delay worries us. We expect the U.N. to
demonstrate some sense of urgency."
</P>
<P>
Zimbabwe, Angola and Namibia deployed troops in August 1998 to
help President Kabila fight rebels.
</P>
<P>
Asked if he was also attending the special session, Kabila
said, "I have just received my invitation here that came from the
United States Ambassador to the UN Richard Holbrooke. I need time
to study it and I will give my answer when I get back to
Kinshasa."
</P>
<P>
"I came to Zimbabwe to consult my ally. We evaluated the
situation in the Congo and we also spoke about the Lusaka peace
agreement.  Obviously we are disappointed by the numerous
violations," he said.
</P>
<P>
"We want to recommend to the Joint Military Commission to do
all in its power to stop these violations. As far as the allied
are concerned we respect the agreement," he said.
</P>
<P>
Kabila arrived here on Sunday to hold talks with Mugabe.

the run-up to the presidential elections in March.
</P>
<P>
He told reporters in his Kremlin office that the main goal of
the shake-up was to come up with a reliable coordinator in
government affairs. Finance Minister Mikhail Kasyanov, who was
promoted to the cabinet's only first deputy prime minister, was
just such a coordinator, Putin said.
</P>
<P>
However, Putin's press secretary Mikhail Kozhukhov said it was
still premature to talk about Mikhail Kasyanov's being appointed
prime minister soon.
</P>
<P>
He said Putin, appointed acting president following Boris
Yeltsin's abrupt resignation on December 31, has recently been
spending much time outside the government building, which is why
he would like a man he completely trusts "to hold the fort."
</P>
<P>
The appointment of a financial and economic expert as first
deputy prime minister is testimony to how much attention Putin is
attaching to that sphere, Kozhukhov said.
</P>
<P>
Putin has repeatedly talked about the necessity to reshuffle
the government and the executive branch and to bring new ideas
there. Kasyanov now has a chance to transform these plans into
practice, the Interfax news agency quoted the spokesman as saying.
</P>
<P>
Kozhukhov said Putin's decision to refrain from bigger
reshuffles and opt for a new arrangement of "roles" was a
reflection of Putin's maturity in personnel affairs.
</P>
<P>
In the government shake-up Monday, Putin also demoted two
former deputy prime ministers. Nikolai Aksyonenko, who used to be
first deputy prime minister and railway minister, kept only the
ministerial post. The other first deputy prime minister, Viktor
Khristenko, was made deputy prime minister.
</P>
<P>
Sergei Shoigu, originally minister for civil defense and
emergency situations, was promoted to the post of deputy prime
minister. Shoigu's pro-government Unity Party scored a surprising
victory in the December 19 parliamentary elections.
</P>
<P>
In addition, Putin also dismissed Kremlin Property Chief Pavel
Borodin, saying he would be given another job. There are reports
that Borodin would be assigned the post of state secretary of the
Russia-Belarus Union.
</P>
<P>
Borodin has been widely accused of involvement in high-level
corruption scandals, but both the Kremlin and Borodin himself had
denied corruption charges.

<HEADLINE> Health Canada Braces for Killer Flu </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
OTTAWA, January 10 (Xinhua) -- Health Canada is bracing for a
killer flu expected to strike the country in three months.
</P>
<P>
A second flu could make its rounds locally between late
February and the end of April in the wake of the current epidemic
of Influenza A Sydney virus, the agency warned Sunday.
</P>
<P>
Since mid-November, Influenza A has killed 11 Canadians, mostly
the elders with weakened immune systems.
</P>
<P>
Health Canada said in its latest warning that it is assembling
a meeting of experts from the whole country in Toronto to discuss
local readiness.
</P>
<P>
A solution could be a flu vaccine created from hen's eggs, and
without vaccines being widely available, up to 50,000 Canadians
could die from a new round of killer flu outbreak, according to
the health agency.
</P>
<P>
Every 20 to 40 years, the flu virus has a major shift, making
the existing vaccine stockpiles useless and the people's immune
systems unprepared to tackle the new bug, the agency said.

<P>
ATHENS, January 10 (Xinhua) -- Greece's inflation rate rose
from 2.6 percent in November to 2.7 percent in December 1999, the
National Statistics Service (NSS) said Monday.
</P>
<P>
The inflation rate last year was significantly lower than the 3.
9 percent and 4.7 percent in the two previous years and the NSS
predicted a continuing fall in the country's inflation rate this
year.
</P>
<P>
It said Greece achieved the inflation rate below 3.0 percent
last year mainly due to the decline of prices in fruits, cars,
telephone charges and electricity.
</P>
<P>
The Greek government believes the drop in fuel prices and
winter sales, which get under way Monday and will last till the
end of February, will have a favorable effect on the inflation
rate.

BERLIN, January 10 (Xinhua) -- German Chancellor Gerhard
Schroeder has canceled a meeting in Berlin with acting Russian
President Vladimir Putin for fear of anti-Chechnya war protest, a

<P>
Schroeder had invited Putin for talks in Berlin before he was

</P>
<P>
Schroeder decided not to hold the talks due to fears of street

Soon after Putin's appointment as acting Russian head of state,
Schroeder considered having a meeting with him during the Swiss
international economic forum that will be held in Davos, a small
city in the east of Switzerland.
</P>
<P>
It is reported that Putin responded to the invitation by saying
that according to the Russian constitution he cannot travel abroad

<P>
LAGOS, January 10 (Xinhua) -- Nigeria's national soccer team
captain and Turkey-based striker Daniel Amokachi will not make the

final squad for the African Nations' Cup tournament because of
injury, assistant team coach Amodu Shaibu said.
</P>
<P>
Shaibu said injuries and lack of form among key players had
significantly weakened the team before the competition which
begins on January 22.
</P>

Shaibu is working with Dutch coach Jo Bonfrere to prepare the
team for the cup which Nigeria won in 1980 and 1994.
</P>
<P>
Amokachi, who has not seen action for Turkish club Besiktas
this season, asked to be in Nigeria's preliminary squad of 31 for
preparations for the 16-nation finals.
</P>
<P>
Shaibu said three newly-invited players would report to camp on

<HEADLINE> China Opposes Using Religion to Split Nation </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, January 10 (Xinhua) -- China today reiterated its
position that it firmly opposes any ethnic separatist activity
that takes advantage of religion.
</P>
<P>
State councilor Ismail Amat told a national conference on
religion work, which opened here today, that considering the
arduous work to be done this year, China will adhere to the reform
and opening-up policy while firmly resisting hostile overseas
forces that use religion to infiltrate into China.
</P>
<P>
He said that over the past 10 years, China has prevented
hostile overseas forces from using religion to split the nation,
and has safeguarded stability in ethnic minority regions.
</P>
<P>
The official attributed this success to the implementation of
President Jiang Zemin's instructions concerning religion, and the
implementation of the Party's religion policy.
</P>
<P>
He noted that China has strengthened the management of
religious affairs while guiding religion to adapt to socialism.

<HEADLINE> Int'l Business Interest in HK Resurges </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, January 10 (Xinhua) -- Thanks to the substantial
downward readjustment in price and strong economic fundamentals
over the past two years, the international interest in Hong Kong
as a business hub has resurged, a senior government official said
here Monday.
</P>
<P>
"There has been a resurgence of international interest in Hong
Kong now that the worst of the Asian financial turmoil is behind
us," Chau Tak Hay, secretary for Trade and Industry, said at the
opening ceremony of Viasystems Asia-Pacific Headquarters in Hong
Kong.
</P>
<P>
Chau said the Viasystem's choice of Hong Kong as the home of
its Asia-Pacific headquarters is a concrete evidence that Hong
Kong continues to be a favored business center for multinational
businesses.
</P>
<P>
Founded in 1996, the company has now emerged as one of the
world's largest independent suppliers of printed circuit board
industry, offering services to its customers around the world.
</P>
<P>
A recent survey conducted on regional representation by
overseas companies has recorded an increase in the number of
regional headquarters and regional offices in 1999 over 1998.
</P>
<P>
The substantial downward readjustment in price in the past two
years has rendered Hong Kong more competitive in cost terms, Chau
said.
</P>
<P>
Office rentals and the cost of staff accommodation have fallen
by some 30 percent since the height of the property market boom in
1997, and the level of operating cost has also dropped
significantly, Chau added.
</P>
<P>
At the same time, Hong Kong's economic fundamentals remain
strong, he said. Hong Kong's world-class transport,
telecommunications and financial infrastructure, strong legal
system and tradition, low and simple taxation, clean and stable
government, as well as the position as the gateway to the Chinese
mainland, are all treasured by international investors, Chau
stressed.
</P>
<P>
The government's policy drive towards the promotion and
development of innovation and technology is another reason why
international business should choose to locate in Hong Kong, Chau
added.

KUWAIT CITY, January 10 (Xinhua) -- Saudi Arabia on Monday sent
a planeload of relief supplies to Venezuela as the first of planned
two batches to flood-hit victims in the South American country.
</P>
<P>
The relief materials, ordered by Saudi King Fahd Ibn Abdul-Aziz,
included 65 tons of foodstuffs, tents, blankets and medicine.
</P>
<P>
The second batch of relief will be flown to Venezuela in a few
days, according to reports from the Saudi capital Riyadh carried by
the Kuwait News Agency.
</P>
<P>
Floods and mudslides devastated Venezuela's Caribbean coast
areas last month. The worst natural disaster that hit the South
American country in 50 years buried scores of villages, killing
thousands of people and leaving more than 150,000 homeless.

<HEADLINE> Another Session of Final-Status Talks Ends </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, January 10 (Xinhua)-- Another session of the final-
status talks between Israeli and Palestinian negotiating teams
ended in the West Bank city of Ramallah on Monday, but made little
headway.
</P>
<P>
During the session, Palestinian chief negotiator Yasser Abed
Rabbo claimed the Palestinian refugees' rights to return to their
homeland and Israel's compensations to the Palestinian refugees for
their property losses and sufferings, but the claim was rejected by
the Israeli negotiating team headed by Oded Eran.
</P>
<P>
However, Palestinian sources said the two sides agreed to
continue their discussions on the refugee issue at the next
session.
</P>
<P>
According to figures issued by the Palestinian side, there are
over three million Palestinian refugees now living in Lebanon,
Syria, Jordan and other countries of the world.
</P>
<P>
Those refugees have been divided into two categories, namely
those who were forced to leave Israel during the 1948 War and
others who left Palestine to take refugee in other places during
the 1967 Middle East War.
</P>
<P>
Israel has said that it will never allow those refugees who left
Israel during the 1948 War to return to Israel.
</P>
<P>
Israel also said that it may consider to compensate those
refugees for their property loses, or seek internationally to help
solve their financial problems.
</P>
<P>
For those refugees who left during the 1967 Middle East War,
Israel will only allow them to gradually return to the Palestinian
controled areas in the West Bank and Gaza Strip.
</P>
<P>
The Palestinian side insists that all the Palestinian refugees
must be allowed to return to their homeland and those who left
Israel do have the "rights" to return to their homes inside Israel.
</P>
<P>
The Palestinian refugee problem is one of the key issues pending
solutions during the final-status talks.
</P>
<P>
The two sides have also to reach a framework agreement on other
issues such as border, water, Jewish settlement and Jerusalem by
Mid- February under the Sharm El Sheikh peace deal.
</P>
<P>
The deal also obliges them to reach a final peace treaty on
those issues by September this year.

<HEADLINE> World Economic Situation Strengthening: BIS  General Manager </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SINGAPORE, January 10 (Xinhua) -- Central bank governors
gathering here for an informal meeting Monday said they were
pleased that the world economic situation is strengthening and the
Asian economy is recovering faster than earlier expected.
</P>
<P>
General Manager of the Bank for International Settlement (BIS)
Andrew Crockett told a press briefing following a one-day informal
meeting of central bank governors that the economic outlook is
favorable and the projected growths globally are now higher than
projections a year ago.
</P>
<P>
The year 2000 is expected to be a year of acceleration over
1999, he said.
</P>
<P>
The governors were noting that the economic situation is
strengthening and at the same time there is no evidence of
acceleration in inflation, he said.
</P>
<P>
Crockett said the governors came to a conclusion that economic
activity is strengthened and monetary policies will have to be
framed in the context of general gradual acceleration of economic
activity.
</P>
<P>
In response to a question about the strength of the U.S. stock
market, Crockett said there was a discussion about the factors
behind the strength of the U.S. stock market and the differential
performances of the technology stocks and other stocks, and
governors recognized that no body could forecast what the market
will do and vigilance had to be maintained in the face of market
developments.
</P>
<P>
At a discussion earlier in the day, Crockett said it was
recognized that debt liquidity management is part of financial
architecture.
</P>
<P>
He said one of the problems that contributed to the Asian
financial crisis was the fact that capital flow is volatile and
countries may be vulnerable to this capital flow, more vulnerable
if they have a particular set of liabilities.
</P>
<P>
Describing the meeting as "serious" and "fairly standard,"
Crockett said no conclusion was reached at the meeting which was
not designed to produce any conclusion.
</P>
<P>
He also said participants reviewed economic development and
market development and there was no discussion specifically on
what individual central bank would do.
</P>
<P>
The meeting was attended by representatives from the Reserve
Bank of Australia, the People's Bank of China, the European
Central Bank, the Hong Kong Monetary Authority, the Reserve Bank
of India, Bank of Indonesia, Bank of Japan, Bank Negara Malaysia,
the Central Bank of the Philippines, the Monetary Authority of
Singapore, South African Reserve Bank, Bank of Korea, Bank of
Sweden, the Bank of England, and the Federal Reserve Bank of New
York.

<HEADLINE> New Sea Port Opened in Somalia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOGADISHU, January 10 (Xinhua) -- Two Somali warlords have
inaugurated a new natural seaport called Jasira Port which is only
12 km southwest of the capital Mogadishu.
</P>
<P>
The first two vessels reached Jasira Port marking the official
opening and functioning of the new installation on Sunday.
Warlords Muse Sudi Yalahow and Abdi Hassan Awaleh Qaybdid told the
crowd that attended the inauguration of seaport that this new
installation is free from politics and that businessmen from all
sides of Mogadishu have paid the contribution for its functioning.
</P>
<P>
According to sources close to the new administration of the
seaport, each large vessel will be charged with 6,000 U.S.
dollars, while 3,000 dollars will be charged on the small ones.
</P>
<P>
The sources furthermore indicate that the two warlords will
take 50 percent of the amount each vessel is charged with for
guaranteeing the security of the seaport and its surroundings,
while the businessmen who paid the contributions will share the
rest.
</P>
<P>
The businessmen have also reorganized their battle wagons with
the aim of escorting the commodities to the destination stores in
the main markets of the capital.
</P>
<P>
The ordinary citizens and businessmen welcomed the opening of
this seaport as another step forward, for the commodities might
even cheapen since it is closer to Mogadishu than any other
seaport.

<HEADLINE> Namibia Police Kill Angolan Refugee by Mistake </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, January 10 (Xinhua) -- A six-year-old Angolan
refugee was shot dead by the Namibian police on Monday morning,
South African Press Association reported.
</P>
<P>
Namibian police spokesman Hophni Hamufungu said a man was also
wounded when the police opened fire on a group of people, thought
to be National Union for the Total Independence of Angola (UNITA)
rebels, in Rundu area close to Namibia's northeastern borders with
Angola,
</P>
<P>
According to Hamufungu, the refugees crossed into Namibia from
Angola late Sunday to flee an upsurge in fighting between UNITA
rebels and the Angolan government forces.
</P>
<P>
"Police first fired warning shots and some of the people didn't
heed and ran off. Then they started to shoot at them suspecting
they could be UNITA elements," Hamufungu said.
</P>
<P>
The security in northeastern Namibia has been cemented since
three French tourists was killed by the UNITA rebels last Monday.

<HEADLINE> Higher Taxes Cut Traffic at Romanian-Serb Borders  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BUCHAREST, January 10 (Xinhua) -- The road traffic crossing the
border from Romania into Yugoslavia decreased sharply after the
Serbs raised the international car insurance tax (the Green Card)
following the New Year's Eve.
</P>
<P>
The number of motor vehicles crossing the border into Serbia
through the Iron Gates I customs point averaged 20 cars per day, a
big drop from 200-150 before the application of the higher tax,
the Nine O'clock daily reported Monday.
</P>
<P>
Depending on vehicle and validity period, the Serb Green Card
now costs a monthly 150 DM for cars, 350 DM per month for tourist
coaches and an annual 2,500 DM for tourist coaches and long-
distance trucks.
</P>
<P>
Before January 1 when Yugoslavia was a member of the Council of
Insurance Offices along with 43 other European countries, the
insurance tax paid by a tourist crossing from Romania into
Yugoslavia was far cheaper, only a monthly 40 U.S. dollars as
compared with the monthly 150 DM (about 79 U.S. dollars) now
charged by the Serbs.
</P>
<P>
After Yugoslavia ceased to be a member of the European system,
Serbs who cross into Romania have to pay the Green Card upon
entering the country at the customs house which in Romania is 919,
000 lei (about 51 U.S. dollars) for cars and 2,262,000 lei (about
124 dollars) for tourist buses.

BUCHAREST, January 10 (Xinhua) -- President of the European
Commission (EC) Romano Prodi will start a two-day visit to Romania
Wednesday, the first leg of his tour to the East European nations
with which the European Union (EU) will hold admission
negotiations.
</P>
<P>
Accompanied by European Commissioner for the EU Enlargement
Gunter Verheugen, Prodi will make his first trip to Romania after

agency.
</P>
<P>
Prodi is expected to hold talks with Romanian Prime Minister
Mugur Isarescu and Foreign Minister Petre Roman on the EC's

and Bulgaria, which was part of the EU enlargement strategy.
</P>
<P>
Observers said Prodi's visit will provide a real chance to

<HEADLINE> Iranian Foreign Minister Begins Visit to Britain </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, January 10 (Xinhua) -- Iranian Foreign Minister Kamal
Kharrazi arrived here Monday for a two-day visit to Britain in an
attempt to improve the relations between the two countries.
</P>
<P>
This is the first high-level official visit to Britain by an
Iranian minister since the 1979 Islamic Revolution.
</P>
<P>
During his stay here, Kharrazi is expected to meet Prime
Minister Tony Blair and Foreign Secretary Robin Cook.
</P>
<P>
The visit follows the main breakthrough in the bilateral ties
between Iran and Britain 18 months ago when the two agreed to
compromise over the affair of British writer Salman Rushdie.
</P>
<P>
After late Iranian leader Ayatollah Khomeini issued a death
warrant for the British author of The Satanic Verses in 1989, the
relations between Britain and Iran has turned sour and come to a
standstill.
</P>
<P>
In Late 1998, the Iranian government stated that it has no
intention to do anything to carry the warning out. And the two
countries has recently upgraded their relations to full
ambassadorial level.
</P>
<P>
However, British officials said British-Iranian relations will
always be sensitive for historical and other reasons.
</P>
<P>
During Kharrazi's visit, Britain will raise concerns about
Iran's "implacable hostility toward Israel, its human rights
record and the fears of its possible plans to develop weapons of
mass destruction".
</P>
<P>
British Foreign Secretary Robin Cook "will make it clear the
visit does not mean that Britain endorses everything going on in
the country," Blair's spokesman told reporters before Kharrazi's
arrival.

<P>
WASHINGTON, January 10 (Xinhua) -- The following are major news
items in leading U.S. newspapers Monday.
</P>
<P>
The Washington Post:
</P>
<P>
-- In handing over the Panama Canal, the United States also
bestowed on the Panamanian government something far less desirable-
-thousands of acres littered with unexploded mortar shells,
grenades and other munitions from decades of arms testing and
training by the U.S. Military.
</P>
<P>
-- British officials confirmed Sunday that they had caught
Libya trying to smuggle components of Scud missiles through London
and said they would file a complaint through newly established
diplomatic channels.
</P>
<P>
The New York Times:
</P>
<P>
-- Fighting raged in Chehnya's mountains and lowlands, even
though Russia's acting president had declared a halt to air and
artillery strikes on the capital to mark a holiday period. News
reports said rebels had surrounded the headquarters of the Russian
commandant in one town.
</P>
<P>
-- Prime Minister Ehud Barak of Israel had a final dinner with
President Bill Clinton and Syria's foreign minister, hashing out a
path to an elusive peace deal. The dinner came at the end of an
inconclusive week of talks, but one that all sides said had
finally resulted in a framework for negotiations between Israel
and Syria.
</P>
<P>
The Wall Street Journal
</P>
<P>
-- Russian attacks resumed against rebels in Chechnya's capital
after a pause Moscow announced Friday for Orthodox Christmas.
Soldiers are reportedly encountering heavy resistance, and some
interviewed by Western journalists said the extent of the
casualties is being covered up as elections near.
</P>
<P>
-- Cuban-American leaders suspended protests over a decision to
return Elian Gonzalez to his father in Cuba after a House Chairman
subpoenaed the six-year-old boy to testify on February 10. That
puts off a January 14 INS deadline for his return.

<HEADLINE> Magic Johnson Signs with Swedish Team </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
STOCKHOLM, January 10 (Xinhua) -- NBA great Magic Johnson has
signed a new two-year contract with Magic M7, a Swedish team he
bought last year.
</P>
<P>
The team manager Steve Haney said on Monday that Johnson signed
the deal two days ago with Majic M7, a team from the Swedish town
of Boras.
</P>
<P>
The 40-year-old basketball legend, who won Olympic gold and
five NBA championships with the Los Angeles Lakers, will return to
Sweden this week for five league matches, starting with a January
14 game in Gothenberg against Sundsvall Dragons.
</P>
<P>
Magic M7 changed its name from M7Boras after they made the
agreement with Johnson. Last year M7Boras finished fifth in the
Swedish league and missed the play-off.
</P>
<P>
Johnson, who led his team to an 84-60 victory over Sallen from
Uppsakka in October, said he picked the Swedish league because he
was impressed by the interest in basketball when he was here for
an exhibition team event in 1996.
</P>
<P>
For the last three years, Johnson has turned his hand to
business, with his company, Magic Johnson Enterprise, branching
into cinemas, a record company and a basketball camp.
</P>
<P>
Johnson tested HIV-positive in 1991. He retired at the start of
the 1991-92 season but made a brief comeback, playing for the
United States "Dream Team" who won gold at the 1992 Barcelona
Olympics.
</P>
<P>
Johnson returned to the game again in January 1996 and played
half of the season but when the Lakers were eliminated from the
playoffs, Johnson retired for good from the NBA.

<HEADLINE> UCI Introduces Compulsory Health Tests </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GENEVA, January 10 (Xinhua) -- UCI, the world governing body of
cycling, announced Monday that all professional riders will be
subject to the world's first comprehensive and compulsory health
tests.
</P>
<P>
The International Cycling Union said in Lausanne that the move,
which will come into effect immediately, is aimed to combat in an
optimum manner the problem of undetectable substances.
</P>
<P>
Cycling, which has been rocked by drugs scandals in recent
years, introduced health tests last year, but the new rules create
uniform requirements, which must also be adopted by national
cycling federations.
</P>
<P>
Under the regulations, every rider will have to undergo
cardiological and eyesight tests before joining a professional
team for the first time. Tests are then repeated every two years
throughout the rider's career.
</P>
<P>
Teams must also organize yearly blood, urine and cardiological
tests, along with more limited testing of blood and urine four
times a year.
</P>
<P>
Riders who refuse to cooperate, or whose results are abnormal,
can be banned from riding by the doctor supervising the tests.
</P>
<P>
UCI has been developing its medical monitoring program for
several years with riders who are found to have a red blood cell
count above 50 percent given a compulsory 15-day ban on health
grounds.
</P>
<P>
The new rules also require every rider to provide a personal
record of medical treatment specifying any substances from UCI's
list of restricted drugs which have been legitimately prescribed.

<HEADLINE> Shanghai Sets Export Goal of 20 Billion U.S. Dollars </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHANGHAI, January 10 (Xinhua) -- Shanghai officials in charge
of foreign trade and economic cooperation disclosed today that the
city's export target for this year is 20 billion U.S. dollars, 1.
21 billion U.S. dollars more than last year.
</P>
<P>
Statistics show that the net export increase for the city was
over 2.8 billion U.S. dollars in 1999, up 17.8 percent over 1998,
and was second nationwide, behind only south China's Guangdong
Province.
</P>
<P>
To maintain this progress, the municipal government will amend
its policies on export enterprises according to their operational
conditions, and will strengthen the cooperation of technology,
other industries, and exports to optimize export commodity
structures, said Shanghai Vice-Mayor Chen Liangyu.
</P>
<P>
Export value last year accounted for one-fourth of the city's
total industrial output value, thereby accelerating the city's
economic growth. Of note is that foreign-funded enterprises are
playing a key role in the increase of exports, accounting for 55.
69 percent of the city's total.

stability and development.
</P>

He said that all far-sighted statesmen should have a clear
understanding of this historic tide and go along with it. In the

<HEADLINE> Weizman Dismisses Report on Resignation </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, January 10 (Xinhua) -- Israeli President Ezer Weizman
Monday dismissed a report that he will announce his resignation
soon over a funding scandal surrounding him in the last two weeks,
saying he has no intention of resigning.
</P>
<P>
Yoav Yitzhak, an investigative journalist who broke the story
late last month that Weizman had received nearly half a million U.
S.dollars from a French businessman between 1988 and 1993 without
reporting or paying taxes, announced Monday that Weizman is to
resign in the coming days.
</P>
<P>
He said people close to the president are pressuring him to step
down before the matter becomes further complicated.
</P>
<P>
This is the second time within a week that Yitzhak claimed the
president is on the verge of resigning.
</P>
<P>
In response, Weizman told Israel Radio that there is no truth to
the latest announcement released by Yitzhak, adding that he has no
intention of resigning the office of President.
</P>
<P>
The president said he will only comment on the details after the
State Attorney's office finishes its investigation over this
matter.
</P>
<P>
Weizman has admitted that he received the disclosed money, 453,
000 U.S. dollars, from French businessman Eduoard Seroussi, a long-
time friend of his, but said the money was received only as a
nontaxable personal gift before he was elected president in 1993.
</P>
<P>
His supporter said that the money was used to pay for medical
treatment for his son Shaul, who was seriously wounded in war and
died in a car accident in 1991.
</P>
<P>
There were reports last week that Ofer Nimrodi, the indicted

<HEADLINE> Sharon Not Allowed to Address Rally on Golan </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, January 10 (Xinhua)-- Opposition Likud Party leader
Ariel Sharon will not be allowed to address the Golan Heights issue
at an anti-withdrawal rally in Tel Aviv Monday evening, the Golan
Settler's Council announced Monday.
</P>
<P>
The council is to hold the rally at Rabin Square, but has
decided not to include the Likud party in its struggle for Golan,
the announcement said.
</P>
<P>
Sharon was invited to sit on the platform but was told that no
political speeches will take place at the rally, it said.
</P>
<P>
The council's strategy toward the national referendum on the
question of Israel's withdrawal from the Golan Heights is to break
the public equilibrium by wining over supporters for Prime Minister
Ehud Barak.
</P>
<P>
The council said organizing the rally is aimed at turning the
struggle into a popular one, not political and not partisan.
</P>
<P>
The council has intensified its activities since the
announcement of the resumption of the Israeli-Syrian peace talks
earlier last monday.
</P>
<P>
It opposes any possible concessions to the Syrians by the
government during the peace talks, including full Israeli
withdrawal from the Golan Heights and dismantlement of their
settlements on the Golan.
</P>
<P>
Israel occupied the Golan Heights during the 1967 Middle East
War.
</P>
<P>
Israel's withdrawal from the Golan, along with water, border,
security arrangement and normalization of ties between the two
countries, are the key issues to be settled during the peace talks.

<HEADLINE> Philippines' Estrada Reaffirms Support for  Concord </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, January 10 (Xinhua) -- Philippine President Joseph
Estrada said Monday that his support for proposed economic reforms
via the Constitutional Correction for Development (Concord)
process remains strong.
</P>
<P>
However, Estrada said this initiative should now give way to
more urgent measures pending in Congress.
</P>
<P>
The president said in a news release that he intends to
disseminate to the public information about the Concord to help
them learn about its benefits and advantages and encourage
enlightened discussions on the issue.
</P>
<P>
He said providing the people with enough and accurate
information about his proposed economic reforms through the
Concord will help ensure that the majority of Filipinos, not just
one sector of society, decide the outcome of this initiative.
</P>
<P>
"Majority of the people don't understand what the Concord is.
That's why I said that the Constitution should be discussed and
not fought over to make sure that the final decision on this issue
would come from the majority," he said.
</P>
<P>
In his Report to the Nation last Saturday, Estrada said he was
temporarily grounding the Concord and would focus instead on
working for congressional approval of more feasible short-term
economic measures with "less cost to national unity."
</P>
<P>
These measures include reforms in the banking industry, retail
trade, revenue collection, and the power sector, as well as bills
that will generate more jobs, provide more funds for mass housing
and provide safety net to sectors most vulnerable to globalization.
</P>
<P>
Various surveys have shown that an overwhelming majority of
Filipinos are opposed to the Concord, particularly the lifting of
restrictions on foreign ownership of land and key industries.

<HEADLINE> Fighting Intensifies in Southern Philippines </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, January 10 (Xinhua) -- The fighting between government
troops and the separatist Moro Islamic Liberation Front (MILF)
intensified in the southern Philippines on Monday as the
government dispatched tanks and more troops to the site of
conflict.
</P>
<P>
Military reports reaching here said two rebels were killed and
10 government soldiers were wounded from last Saturday to Monday.
One civilian was killed on Monday by a stray bullet.
</P>
<P>
The fighting started last Saturday in Maguindanao province in
the southern Philippines hours after Muslims culminated their
Ramadan, Islam faithfuls' month-long fasting season.
</P>
<P>
On Monday, MILF rebels blocked a critical stretch of highway in
Maguindanao province, denying commuters as their fighting against
government troops escalated.
</P>
<P>
The MILF rebels also flagged down several private vehicles,
including a media van, to serve as "shield" against advancing
government forces along the highway.
</P>
<P>
Some 5,000 evacuees from nearby villages fled to safer grounds
as intense fighting continued in the area.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the Army's Sixth Infantry Division dispatched tanks
to the site of conflict in a bid to disperse some 300 MILF men
holding the highway.
</P>
<P>
And additional ground troops were also sent to the area to
augment troops presently locked in battle with the guerrillas.
</P>
<P>
Observers fear the new encounter would hamper anew the peace
talks between the government and the MILF which are due to resume
on January 17.

<HEADLINE> Storm Shatters French Railway Company's Hope of Profit making </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, January 10 (Xinhua) -- The storm that hit France during
the 1999 Christmas season has shattered the hope of the French
state railway company SNCF to make a profit by the year 2001, said
SNCF president Louis Gallois Monday.
</P>
<P>
The SNCF registered a sales figure of 77.8 billion francs (13
billion U.S. dollars) in 1999 and its deficit dropped to 73
million francs (12 million dollars) from 649 million francs (108
million dollars) in 1998.
</P>
<P>
But an estimated 500 million franc (84 million dollar) loss
caused by the storm will make the company impossible to make a
profit this year, said Gallois.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the SNCF will spend another 500 million francs in
2000 to adjust itself to the 35-working-week law which comes into
force this year, he added.
</P>
<P>
As a result of the storm, 15,000 points on French railways were
cut by fallen objects such as trees, while the breakdown of
electricity in many parts of France forced trains to a standstill
on many lines.

<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, January 10 (Xinhua) -- French truckers who are
protesting against the 35-hour work week have blocked three
highways linking France and Belgium by mid-day Monday.
</P>
<P>
The highway linking the northern city of Lille with Belgium's
Gent has been completely blocked, said the center of information
and coordination of road transport CRICR.
</P>
<P>
The blockade has caused a traffic jam of seven kilometers on
the road from Tourcoing in northern France to Rekkem, the border
entry point on A22 expressway.
</P>
<P>
The drivers who are not joining the protest are using a
national deviation road which passes through Belgium's Mouscron to
replace A22, said the CRICR.
</P>
<P>
On the expressway A27 from Lille to Brussels, striking truckers
have set up a two-day blockade at Baisieux in northern France,
forcing the road authorities to close the highway to avoid a more
serious traffic jam.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, truckers blocked a third trans-national expressway,
A16, which links France and Belgium along the sea coast, said the
CRICR.

PARIS, January 10 (Xinhua) -- Frenchman Fabrice Santoro jumped
to the top of the world rankings Monday under the new, year-long
system after he won the Doha ATP tour event on Sunday.
</P>

Santoro, 27, beat Germany's Rainer Schuttler to win the event
which made him garner 50 points to lead the rankings ahead of
compatriot Jerome Golmard, Australian Lleyton Hewitt and Schuttler
who all have 35 points.

designed to simplify the previous set-up which was based on a
rolling calculation of best tournament performances.
</P>
<P>
Elite players (the top 50) will be required to compete in all
nine of the newly named Tennis Masters Series, the four Grand Slam
events and at least five other tournaments of their choice. Miss
an event and it's zero points, just like in Formula One racing or
professional golf.
</P>
<P>
Players not ranked high enough can count other lower level
tournaments to make up the minimum total of 18 events played.

<P>
LANZHOU, January 10 (Xinhua) -- Construction started today on
the Baoji-Laozhou railway section, which will run in northwest
China from Shaanxi Province to Gansu Province, and is expected to
play an important role in the economic development of the western
region of the country.
</P>
<P>
The 487-km-long project consists of 95 railway bridges, and 90
tunnels totaling 62,500 meters. It will be built in four years at
an investment expected to be some 9.88 billion yuan (about 120
million U.S. dollars), according to the project director.
</P>
<P>
This rail section, which is also part of the new Europe-Asia
land bridge, will increase the daily transportation capacity on
the line to 16 return trains and the annual cargo transportation
to 13 million tons.
</P>
<P>
The previous railway section running through these two
provinces was opened in October 1952, the first to run through
China from west to east. Because it can no longer satisfy the
increased transportation needs due to national economic growth
since the 1980s, the second line has become essential, said the
project managers.

time in over half a century.
</P>
<P>
The National Bureau of Statistics (NBS) will create methods of

</P>
<P>
NBS official Li Qiang said that most of the private enterprises

owned and collective enterprises, the mainstays of the country's
economy. However, private enterprises have grown rapidly in the
past 20 years, and now account for nearly 20 percent of the
country's industrial output.
</P>
<P>
Since 1998, the NBS has set up data banks for enterprises of
various types of ownership, drafted detailed plan for surveying
private enterprises, and already started conducting surveys in
several industries.
</P>
<P>
Li said that since China now has more than 1.2 million private
enterprises, the only possible method of gathering data from them
is via sample surveys. The central government and some local
governments have already earmarked funds for this work.

<HEADLINE> China to Put Statistics System On-line </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, January 10 (Xinhua) -- China will create an Internet-
based national statistics system in two years to enhance
transparency of social and economic operations and increase
international statistics exchange and cooperation.
</P>
<P>
A national meeting of heads of local statistics bureaus held
here today announced that construction of the 400-million-yuan
statistical information project is well underway.
</P>
<P>
So far, a three-tier electronic data network has been set up
connecting the National Bureau of Statistics (NBS) with local
statistics bureaus at the provincial level and in some major
cities.
</P>
<P>
All 31 provinces, municipalities directly under the central
government and autonomous regions have now opened their own
websites of official statistics on the Internet.
</P>
<P>
The electronic data network has improved the efficiency of
statistics bureaus and the data quality..
</P>
<P>
The China Statistical Information Network, run by the NBS, has
attracted 140,000 viewers since it was launched on February 26,
1999.
</P>
<P>
The NBS not only has released official statistics on-line, but
also has used the electronic network to collect and process
reports from 180,000 industrial enterprises in China sent directly
to the network.
</P>
<P>
Using the electronic network to collect data has helped prevent
local government interference in the compilation of official
figures.
</P>
<P>
Xu Tiefu, director of the Information Center of the NBS, said
that the hardware of the China Statistical Information Network now
approaches the technological level of similar ones in Western
countries.
</P>
<P>
The network is able to transmit data at a speed of 2.88 mega-
bytes per minute and has a huge data banks. One website operated
by the Tianjin Municipal Statistics Bureau contains 40 billion
bytes of information, equal to 20 billion Chinese characters.
</P>
<P>
Xu said that in the next two years the NBS will focus on
expanding the electronic network to cover county-level data and
developing various services for the average Internet user.

<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, January 10 (Xinhua)-- Israeli and Palestinian
negotiating teams on Monday continued their final-status talks in
the West Bank city of Ramallah, with the Palestinian refugee issue
on top of the agenda.
</P>
<P>
Palestinian chief negotiator Yasser Abed Rabbo told reporters
before the session that the Palestinian side is ready to discuss
with the Israeli team the ways to address the rights of Palestinian
refugees to return to their homeland under the signed agreements.
</P>
<P>
According to figures issued by the Palestinian side, there are
over 3 million Palestinian refugees now living in Lebanon, Syria,
Jordan and other countries of the world.
</P>
<P>
They have been divided into two categories, namely those who
were forced to leave Israel during the 1948 War and others who left
Palestine to take refuge in other places during the 1967 Middle
East war.
</P>
<P>
Israel has said that it will never allow those refugees who left
Israel during the 1948 War to return to Israel.
</P>
<P>
Israel also said that it may consider compensating those
refugees for their property losses, or seeking international funds
to help solve their financial problems.
</P>
<P>
For those refugees who left Palestine during the 1967 Middle
East war, Israel will only allow them gradually to return to the
Palestinian controled areas in the West Bank and Gaza Strip.
</P>
<P>
The Palestinian side insists that all the Palestinian refugees
must be allow to return to their homeland and those who left Israel
do have the "rights" to return to their homes inside Israel.
</P>
<P>
Palestinian refugee problem is of the key issues pending
solutions during the final-status talks which started last
September.
</P>
<P>
The two sides have to reach a framework agreement on other
issues such as borders, water, Jewish settlement and the final
status of Jerusalem by mid-February under the Sharm el Sheikh peace
deal signed last September. The two sides also set a target date to
reach a final peace treaty by September this year.

<HEADLINE> Australian Aviation Authority Grounds Planes Using  Bad Fuel </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, January 10 (Xinhua) -- The Civil Aviation Safety
Authority (CASA) of Australia Monday grounded thousands more small
aircraft in eastern Australia due to the fuel contamination crisis
of the Mobil company.
</P>
<P>
The new directive, previously requiring pre-flight tests only,
was extended Monday afternoon to all aircraft which used fuel
produced from Mobil's Altona Avgas refinery between November 21
and December 23 last year.
</P>
<P>
CASA ordered the aircraft to remain on the ground after new
facts emerged about the contamination.
</P>
<P>
"There is now evidence of the contamination in a white or clear
form which had previously been undetected," a CASA spokesman said
in a statement.
</P>
<P>
"The new form of the contamination means the fuel systems of
aircraft that used the problem Mobil 100/130 Avgas cannot easily
be cleaned," he said.
</P>
<P>
Until now, aircraft owners and operators had been looking for
black deposits in fuel systems as evidence of contamination.
</P>
<P>
The black deposits were formed when the contaminant reacted
with the copper in aircraft fuel system parts.
</P>
<P>
"Information from Mobil now indicates the white or clear
contamination deposits are formed when the contaminant reacts with
carbon dioxide in air," the spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
CASA was working urgently with Mobil to develop a standard
field test to determine if an aircraft had the contamination, he
added.

<TEXT>
<P>
LUANDA, January 10 (Xinhua) -- The visit paid by President of
the United Nations Angolan Sanctions Committee Robert Fowler will
give the Angolan government an incentive to continue its efforts
for achieving a durable peace, a former rebel leader was quoted by
an official newspaper as saying on Monday.
</P>
<P>
Jorge Valentim, a secretary of the Renovated Commission of the
National Union for the Total Independence of Angola (UNITA), said
he was satisfied with the arrival of Robert Fowler.
</P>
<P>
According to the official newspaper Jornal de Angola, Jorge
Valentim, responsible for external affairs of the Renovated UNITA,
said that Fowler had done a lot for a total isolation of the
rebel leader Jonas Savimbi.
</P>
<P>
Fowler arrived in Luanda on Saturday, beginning his one-week
visit to the war-torn southwest African country.
</P>
<P>
He will discuss with the Angolan government on how to reinforce
the UN sanctions against UNITA rebels, especially diamond embargo.
</P>
<P>
Fowler will also visit the cities newly captured by the
government troops in the central highland such as Andulo and
Bailundo which are considered as major rebel strongholds.

<HEADLINE> Cargos Through Tanzanian Seaports Decrease </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, January 10 (Xinhua) -- Cargos through Tanzanian
sea ports fell by 9.1 percent in the year 1998/1999 despite the
increasing number of ships calling at these ports, a Bank of
Tanzania report said recently.
</P>
<P>
According to the Economic and Operations Report of the Bank of
Tanzania for the year which ended on June 30 1999, cargos conveyed
through the Tanzanian ports of Dar es Salaam, Tanga and Mtwara
declined from 4.4 million tons in 1997/1998 to four million tons
during the year under review.
</P>
<P>
The report said this was due to economic hardships and
political instability in the neighboring countries using Tanzanian
ports, including Uganda, Rwanda, Burundi, the Democratic Republic
of the Congo, Zambia and Malawi.
</P>
<P>
The annual report quoted figures from the Tanzania Harbors
Authority as saying the number of ships calling at the Tanzanian
ports increased by 23.9 percent, from 4,618 ships in1997/1998 to
5,724 during the year under review.
</P>
<P>
Deep sea ship calls increased by 8.8 percent from 724 ships to

MOSCOW, January 10 (Xinhua) -- Russian Acting President
Vladimir Putin reshuffled the cabinet Monday, promoting Finance
Minister Mikhail Kasyanov to the post of first prime minister and
demoting two other deputy prime ministers.
</P>
<P>
Nikolai Aksyonenko, who used to be first deputy prime minister
and railway minister, kept only the ministerial post. The other
first deputy prime minister, Viktor Khristenko, was made deputy
prime minister, the Interfax news agency reported, citing the
Kremlin press service.
</P>
<P>
Sergei Shoigu, originally minister for civil defense and
emergency situations, was promoted to the post of deputy prime
minister. Shoigu's pro-government Unity Party scored a surprising
victory in the December 19 parliamentary elections.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Putin dismissed Kremlin Property Chief Pavel
Borodin, saying he would be given another job. Borodin has been
widely accused of involvement in high-level corruption scandals.
</P>
<P>
Interfax said Putin has changed the structure of the federal
government and from now on, the prime minister will have seven
deputies with one first deputy.

<HEADLINE> WTO Entry to Promote China's Telecom Reform (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, January 10 (Xinhua) -- The China-U.S. deal on China's
entry into the World Trade Organization (WTO) has given an impetus
to the country's ongoing reform of the telecommunications industry,
said Wu Jichuan, minister of information industry.
</P>
<P>
"Without entry into the WTO, the reform of China's telecom
business would still be cruising along its set course," said Wu at
an interview with Caijing, the latest monthly edition of
Securities Market Weekly. "The signing of the Sino-U.S. agreement
on China's WTO entry has made the issue of the telecom reform only
more urgent," he said.
</P>
<P>
Many WTO member countries allow foreign investors to hold 20-40
percent of the shares in their telecommunications sector, and
China has promised even bigger shares after joining the WTO, said
the minister.
</P>
<P>
This demonstrates the China's government's sincere desire for
accession into the WTO, he said, adding that China is still a
developing country and can hardly meet requirements that are too
high for its reality.
</P>
<P>
"We have made this promise during our transition period to a
market economy, at a time when there is not a special law on
telecommunications and the legal system is not yet complete and
sound," Wu said.
</P>
<P>
In 1997, China Telecom restructured its mobile communications
business to set up an independent company, which was later listed
in the Hong Kong and New York stock exchanges. Foreign investors
hold 25 percent of the share capital of China Telecom (Hong Kong),
which has six provincial mobile telecommunications companies.
</P>
<P>
"In fact, we have met the requirements as determined in the
Sino-U.S. agreement as early as two years ago," Wu said.

divided the China Telecom into four companies, setting up fixed

while transferring the paging service to China Unicom.
</P>
<P>
Wu said that his ministry will soon release a set of
regulations on the management of Internet service providers (ISPs),
adding that the ministry approves and supervises ISP businesses
and is not responsible for approving Internet content providers (
ICPs).
</P>
<P>
"Of course, the Ministry of Information Industry must know the

and international calls are higher than what they should be while

<HEADLINE> China to Punish Officials for False Figures </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, January 10 (Xinhua) -- The Chinese government is to
give sterner punishment to local government officials who are
found to report false statistics to higher authorities this year,
warning that they will be dismissed from their positions if caught
doing so.
</P>
<P>
Liu Hong, director of the National Bureau of Statistics (NBS),
told a national meeting of heads of local statistics bureaus here
today that this year the central government will adopt stronger
law enforcement measures to safeguard the integrity of official
figures.
</P>
<P>
"The focus will be on discovering and punishing people who
illegally use their power to intervene in composing official
statistics, especially those who cheat for political or financial
gain by way of false statistics," he said.
</P>
<P>
Recently the Chinese government decided not to promote or give
important positions to officials who distort statistics and to
remove them from the current positions for previous wrong-doings
in other positions.
</P>
<P>
Li Qiang, director of the Department of Statistical Design and
Management of the NBS, told Xinhua that in recent years, many
local governments have exaggerated the growth rate of local
economy as they reported the statistics to the central government.
However, he noted that local government figures about gross
domestic product (GDP) were accurate.
</P>
<P>
Since 1999, the NBS has begun using surveys to reflect the
rapid changes in China's economy. This year, it will ask the
country's 5,000 biggest industrial enterprises and 3,000 major
real estate companies to directly report their figures to the NBS.
The move is aimed to prevent local governments from intervening in
calculating statistics.
</P>
<P>
The efforts were recognized by the World Bank, as it sent two
delegations to investigate statistics systems in local governments
in China last year. The World Bank decided that official GDP
figures of the Chinese government are accurate. It has stopped
readjusting these figures in its estimation of China economy since
1999.
</P>
<P>
The United Nations, the International Monetary Fund and other
international organizations have also accepted the accuracy of
Chinese official statistics. They recognized that the composing of
the figures conforms with international practice.
</P>
<P>
Liu said that since many key government projects are entering
their final phase this year, the government should watch for the
growing tendency among local governments to exaggerate the
achievements.
</P>
<P>
He said that the NBS will continue to carry out the directions
that Chinese President Jiang Zemin and other top government
officials made on cracking down on statistics fraud. It will put
improving quality of official statistics at the core of its agenda
this year.

<HEADLINE> Senior CPC Official Meets Mongolian Party Secretary </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, January 10 (Xinhua) -- Wei Jianxing, member of the
Standing Committee of the Political Bureau of the Central
Committee of the Communist Party of China (CPC), said here today
that China has high regard for its good-neighborly relations with
Mongolia and hopes the two countries will continue to be "good
friends" and "good neighbors."
</P>
<P>
Wei, also member of the Secretariat of the CPC Central
Committee, also told B. Delgermaa, general secretary of the
Mongolian National Democratic Party (MNDP), who is visiting here,
that the CPC and the Chinese Government will continue to respect
the independence and sovereignty of Mongolia and the approach the
Mongolian people chose for their country's development.
</P>
<P>
The CPC and the MNDP have maintained a good relationship. Wei
said that the CPC is willing to further develop the relationship
with the MNDP and other parties of Mongolia under the principles
of independence, complete equality, mutual respect and non-
interference in each other's internal affairs.
</P>
<P>
Delgermaa said her party is also ready to further develop a
friendly and cooperative relationship with the CPC to help improve
state-to-state relations.
</P>
<P>
China and Mongolia established diplomatic relations 50 years
ago. Mongolian President Nachagyn Bagabandy paid a state visit to
China in 1998 while Chinese President Jiang Zemin visited Mongolia
last year.
</P>
<P>
During their visit, the two presidents declared to build up a
long-term, stable, healthy, mutual-trust relationship based on
good-neighborliness, friendship and cooperation in the 21st
century.

<HEADLINE> 100 Cancer Survivors Greet New Millennium </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, January 10 (Xinhua) -- About 100 cancer survivors
gathered at the Great Hall of People in Beijing today to celebrate
the first Spring Festival in the new millennium.
</P>
<P>
Fan Banhan, a six-year-old boy from north China's port city of
Tianjin, who has recovered from brain cancer, hid his rosy face in
his mother's arms to avoid the glare of photographers' flashbulbs.
</P>
<P>
"I was desperate when the doctor told me that my son had brain
cancer a year and a half ago," said the boy's mother, Liu Guofen.
"His weight fell to 19 kilograms after a brain operation and some
chemotherapy, and he looked very ill."
</P>
<P>
Like many cancer survivors who gathered here today, Banhan's
family finally turned to traditional Chinese medicine. After
several months of taking an herbal medicine, the boy began to put
on weight and his cheeks have regained their healthy glow.
</P>
<P>
He was one of the "100 anti-cancer fighters" honored by the
International Cancer Healing Association and the Zhenguo
Industrial Group.
</P>
<P>
Someone dies of cancer every six seconds in the world, and the
disease claims 1.05 million lives each year in China, or 15
percent of the total mortality figure, said Wang Zhenguo,
president of the association, who added that conquering cancer is
a common wish of all people.
</P>
<P>
He said that the activity is to advertise the positive effects
of traditional Chinese medicine and inspire cancer patients to
fight against their disease by taking strength from the
experiences of cancer survivors.
</P>
<P>
Eleven cancer survivors from the United States, Japan, Thailand,
Malaysia and other countries as well as from Taiwan and Hong Kong,
and 89 cancer survivors from the Chinese interior area, who have
recovered with the help of traditional Chinese medicine, attended
today's party.
</P>
<P>
"Cancer does not mean death," said Huang Po, a 39-year-old man
from Changchun City in northeast China's Jilin Province. He was
diagnosed with lymphoma in 1994, and almost lost his will to live.
</P>
<P>
However, after a period of therapy that combined western and
Chinese medicines, his health returned and he was strong enough to
complete a four-month bicycle tour. He and other cancer survivors
rode bicycles from his hometown to Zhuhai City in south China's
Guangdong Province late last year to greet the return of Macao to
the motherland.
</P>
<P>
"We spent 110 days on the trip across east China," said the
tall traveler. "We told people we met during the trip that cancer
is not incurable if prompt and proper therapies are applied."
</P>
<P>
He is raising money for another trip to west China, and will
continue to advertise the combined cancer-fighting therapies of
western and Chinese medicines.
</P>
<P>
"I will tell every cancer patient I meet that 'you can become
as healthy as me tomorrow'," he said.

<HEADLINE> mee011005 hke -- Iranian Foreign Minister Pays Landmark Visit to UK </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, January 10 (Xinhua) -- Iranian Foreign Minister Kamal
Kharrazi left here for London on Monday morning on a groundbreaking
visit since the 1979 Islamic revolution in Iran, the state-run
television reported.
</P>
<P>
Before his departure, Kharrazi said that it is the time for the
two countries to prepare the ground to build bilateral ties based
on mutual respect, mutual interest and non-interference in each
other's internal affairs.
</P>
<P>
He said that he would discuss most important bilateral and
international issues with British officials and explore ways for
cooperation in economic, cultural and other fields between the two
countries.
</P>
<P>
Kharrazi also said that he would voice Tehran's "displeasure"
over the "insulting" article published by the London daily Times.
</P>
<P>
On its millennium issue, the Times reprinted the 1989 obituary
which termed the religious verdict by late Iranian supreme leader
Ayatollah Musavi Khomeini against the life of the British writer
Salman Rushdie as "a disaster".
</P>
<P>
Iranian Foreign Ministry summoned the British charge d'affaires
to Tehran Neil Crompton in protest to the article and called for an
apology from London.
</P>
<P>
British ambassador to Iran Nicholas Brown on Friday expressed
regret over the issue soon after he returned to Tehran trying to
calm down the Iranian anger.
</P>
<P>
Brown said that his government is eagerly awaiting the ground-
breaking visit of the Iranian foreign minister to London, and
Kharrazi's visit and his scheduled meeting with British Prime
Minister Tony Blair and Foreign Secretary Robin Cook are of special
importance to the British government.
</P>
<P>
Iran and Britain promoted their relations to ambassadorial level
last May after the two countries agreed to put aside the issue of
Rushdie, who was sentenced to death by Khomeini in 1989 for alleged
blasphemy against Islam in his controversial novel "the Satanic
Verses".

<HEADLINE> Malaysia's Largest State to Develop Commercial Agriculture </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUALA LUMPUR, January 10 (Xinhua) -- Sarawak, Malaysia's
largest state, will make efforts to develop the agriculture
commercially as it tries to be a leading food producer in the
country, the State's Agriculture and Food Industry Minister Adenan
Satem said Monday.
</P>
<P>
Various new concepts which are commercially viable will be
implemented for the long term as Sarawak, one of the two states in
East Malaysia, has vast tracts of idle land, he said at his Hari
Raya (Festival Day) (Muslims' New Year) open house in the state,
Bernama news agency reported.
</P>
<P>
Some 1.5 million hectares of land, an area bigger than any
state in peninsular Malaysia, has yet to be developed in Sarawak.
</P>
<P>
"We must put in more effort in value-added terms through the
processing of raw materials for the benefit of the people of the
state," he was quoted as saying.
</P>
<P>
"Sarawak needs a paradigm shift ... we cannot depend on
subsistence agriculture but need a market as well as good
agricultural management," he said.
</P>
<P>
He said his ministry had discussed with new federal Agriculture
Minister Effendi Norwawi the possible pooling of resources to meet
this objective.
</P>
<P>
He said the state and federal ministries would look into ways
to make the food industry more value-added oriented for the state'
s agricultural output and products.

<HEADLINE> Share Prices Close Higher on Singapore Stock Market </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SINGAPORE, January 10 (Xinhua) -- Share prices closed higher
with mixed results on Singapore stock market on Monday as earlier
gains in the day could not be sustained in the absence of fresh
leads.
</P>
<P>
The benchmark Straits Times Index (STI) ended the day 27.64
points up at 2,433.68.
</P>
<P>
Total volume increased to 389.19 million shares worth 746.87
million Singapore dollars (about 450.11 million U.S. dollars).
Countering against the overall upward trend of the STI index,
however, losers outpaced losers 186 to 144 with 167 counters
unchanged.
</P>
<P>
The larger block was the 22.35 million parcel by OUB DBeCw01
which was transacted at 0.48 Singapore dollars per share. It was
followed by Benefun which had 22.08 million units done. Kingboard
was the next with 14.40 million counters changing hands.
</P>
<P>
Venture became the biggest gainer of the day after it
skyrocketed 320 cents to close at 29.20 Singapore dollars.
Chartered rose by 100 cents to a finish of 11.20 Singapore dollars.
PacCent climbed by 60 cents to end at 17.70 Singapore dollars.
</P>
<P>
On the downside, ShangAsia led the descent of the day incurring
a loss of 115 cents to close at 8.25 Hong Kong dollars. DBS shed
50 cents to finish at 24.50 Singapore dollars. CityDev retreated
45 cents to end at 9.00 Singapore dollars.
</P>
<P>
Dealers said that the market opened higher on the back of gains
in New York last Friday.
</P>
<P>
They added that, however, sentiment was dampened in the
afternoon after Prime Minister Goh Chok Tong said he was concerned
about the euphoria over internet stocks.

PARIS, January 10 (Xinhua) -- French soldiers serving in the U.
N. force in East Timor have ended their three-month mission and
will leave the newly independent state in a few days, Agence
France-Presse (AFP) said Monday.
</P>
<P>
About 100 French soldiers have run a field hospital since last
October near the airport of Dili, the capital of East Timor, AFP

(INTERFET) as saying.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, some 600 Australian soldiers of INTERFET have also
ended their mission and will leave East Timor Monday evening,
according to AFP.
</P>
<P>
The French and Australian soldiers will be replaced by forces
of other countries joining the INTERFET, which was established by
the United Nations Security Council for bringing order to East
Timor.

<HEADLINE> S. Korea's Short-term Debt Up  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SEOUL, January 10 (Xinhua) -- South Korea's short-term external
debt, which the nation must repay within one year, hit 38 billion
U.S.dollars last November, up 7.3 billion from the previous year,
the Ministry of Finance and Economy said Monday.
</P>
<P>
It accounted for 28 percent of total external liabilities, up 7.
4 percentage points year-on-year.
</P>
<P>
Short-term external debts rose because firms were importing
more goods and materials on credit to meet the surging demand for
their products amid the fast economic recovery.
</P>
<P>
A surge in short-term external liabilities was one of major
causes of the financial crisis in late 1997 which forced South
Korea to borrow a rescue loan of 58 billion U.S. dollars from the
International Monetary Fund in December 1997.
</P>
<P>
However, the current level of short-term external debt remained
comparatively low and the country already had sufficient foreign
reserves to absorb future external shocks, some experts said.
</P>
<P>
South Korea's total external debts stood at 135.7 billion U.S.
dollars last November, down 300 million from the previous month
while total external bonds rose to 144.1 billion U.S. dollars, up
4.3 billion.
</P>
<P>
As a result, net external debt, which is the difference between
external liabilities and bonds fell to negative 8.4 billion U.S.
dollars, showing that the country has more money to collect than
to repay.
</P>
<P>
South Korea became a net creditor country last September for
the first time since 1979 and has maintained its position
thereafter.

<HEADLINE> Shas Slams NRP Rabbis' Ruling on Golan </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, January 10 (Xinhua) -- Israel's powerful religous
party Shas has described a ruling by the rabbis of the National
Religious Party (NRP) on the future of the Golan Heights as
politically-motivated.
</P>
<P>
NRP rabbis, led by former chief rabbi Avraham Shapira, last week
ruled that the Golan Heights is part of the land of Israel,
indicating that the Heights cannot be handed over to the Syrians
even if Prime Minister Ehud Barak signs a peace deal with Syria.
</P>
<P>
Both Shas and NRP are coalition partners of the Barak government
with Shas having 17 members in the Knesset (parliament) and NRP
five members.
</P>
<P>
The ruling on the future of the Golan, to be made by Shas
spiritual leader Rabbi Ovadia Yosef, is very much likely to
differ from that of the NRP, Shas Council of Torah Sages (SCTS)
Secretary General Raphael Pinphasi told The Jerusalem Post
newspaper on Monday.
</P>
<P>
"In our case, the rabbis' decision will be based on Halacha
(religious teachings) and not on politics," Pinphasi said.
</P>
<P>
Yosef has not made his final decision on the Golan issue, but he
is widely expected to issue a ruling that Golan is not part of the
land of Israel.
</P>
<P>
Before reaching a final decision, Yosef has embarked on a series
of meetings with politicians, army generals and political party
leaders to learn the facts about what a peace deal with Syria would
entail.
</P>
<P>
President Ezer Weizman has already met with Yosef and asked him
to back Barak on striking a peace deal with Syria.
</P>
<P>
Opposition Likud leader Ariel Sharon has called on Yosef several
times and urged him to fight against Barak's move for a full
withdrawal from the Golan.
</P>
<P>
Israel occupied the Golan Heights during the 1967 Middle East
war and Israel's return to Syria of the Golan is one of the key
issues being discussed at the ongoing Israel-Syria peace talks,
which started at Shepherdstown, West virginia, last Monday.
</P>
<P>
Barak is scheduled to return home on Tuesday, leaving behind the
Israeli experts to continue the peace talks with their Syrian
counterparts in the United States.
</P>
<P>
Shas maintains a moderate stance on the Middle East peace
process and its support is very important for Barak to conclude a
peace deal with Syria.

<HEADLINE> Japanese PM Visits Cambodia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PHNOM PENH, January 10 (Xinhua) -- Japanese Prime Minister
Keizo Obuchi arrived here Monday to begin his three-day official
visit to Cambodia at the invitation of Cambodian Prime Minister
Hun Sen.
</P>
<P>
Obuchi and his party were greeted at the Pochentong
international airport by Prime Minister Hun Sen and other senior
government officials.
</P>
<P>
Obuchi's visit to Cambodia is the first in more than 40 years
by a Japanese prime minister.
</P>
<P>
The aim of the visit is to exchange the views on strengthening
the bilateral relations and developing economic and trade
cooperation between the two countries, including the financial
assistance offered to Cambodia for the constructions of irrigation
and roads and other infrastructure.
</P>
<P>
During his stay, Obuchi will be received in a Royal Audience by
King Norodom Sihanouk and pay courtesy calls on Senate President
Chea Sim and National Assembly President Prince Ranariddh, as well
as to hold discussions with Prime Minister Hun Sen.
</P>
<P>
The two prime ministers will also preside over the signing
ceremony of two Exchanges of Notes concerning the projects for
improvement of the National Tuberculosis Center and of the
National Route 6 Siem Reap section.
</P>
<P>
Japan is the one of the key donor countries to Cambodia. Its
total economic aid to Cambodia has reached about 700 million U.S.
dollars since 1992, while the loans amounted to 40 million U.S.
dollars, according to official figure.
</P>
<P>
Obuchi and his party will visit Angkor Wat on Wednesday, then
they will fly to Laos and Thailand to continue their three-nation
Asia tour.

<HEADLINE> Prospect of Thai Gifts, Home Decorations Bright:  Research </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, January 10 (Xinhua) -- Exports of Thai gifts and home
decorations have a bright prospect in the international market as
sales increased in the past four years, Thai Farmers' Bank
Research Center said here Monday.
</P>
<P>
The center said in a report that exports of Thailand-made gifts
and home decorations have increased from 31.18 billion baht (840
million U.S. dollars) in 1996 to 47.21 billion baht (1.28 billion
dollars) in 1998.
</P>
<P>
The center forecast that export of these products in 1999 might
be 45 billion baht (1.22 billion dollars), a slight decline
compared with that of 1998 due to economic slowdown in importing
markets and stronger baht.
</P>
<P>
Major importing markets for the Thai gifts and home decorations
include the United States, the European Union and Japan, with
exports to the American market accounting for some 45 percent of
the total value.
</P>
<P>
However, the center suggests that local producers further
upgrade the style and quality of their products in order to
increase their competitiveness against major competitors,
including China, South Korea, the Philippines, Indonesia, Mexico
and countries of the European Union.

<HEADLINE> Fierce Fighting Reported in Chechnya </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>

<P>
MOSCOW, January 10 (Xinhua) -- Fierce fighting has been going
on over the past 24 hours in Chechnya and the Russian federal
troops said 26 servicemen were killed and over 30 wounded, the
Itar-Tass news agency reported Monday.
</P>
<P>
The situation in Argun and Shali has stabilized, Tass said,
quoting officers with the federal troops' North Caucasus
headquarters in Mozdok.
</P>
<P>
In Gudermes, the rebels seized a school building and held an
unspecified number of people hostage.
</P>
<P>
Victor Kazantsev, commander of the North Caucasus federal
grouping, announced a curfew in Shali, Argun and other residential
areas in the breakaway republic.
</P>
<P>
"One can move around only by day. Movement will be forbidden
at night," Tass quoted Kazantsev as saying.
</P>
<P>
Only women, children and old people will be defined as
refugees with the curfew in place, and all others will be subject
to identity checks, Kazantsev said.
</P>
<P>
On Sunday, federal aircraft ran more than 50 bombing missions
on targets in the Vedeno and Argun gorges. Su-25 attack planes, Su-
24 bombers and Mi-24 helicopters were involved in the operation.
</P>
<P>
Sixteen strongholds, seven vehicles, 11 firing positions, four
air defense installations, two communication centers, one arms

<HEADLINE> Afghan War Veteran Elected Governor of Moscow Region </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>

<P>
MOSCOW, January 10 (Xinhua) -- Boris Gromov, a popular Soviet-
era general, won the Sunday elections for governor of the Moscow
region, according to preliminary results released Monday.
</P>
<P>
Gromov garnered 48.08 percent of the votes, beating former
Russian State Duma speaker Gennady Seleznyov by some two
percentage points. The State Duma is the lower house of parliament.
</P>
<P>
The two failed to win an absolute majority in the first round
of balloting on December 19.
</P>
<P>
The Moscow region covers a large swathe of land around the
Russian capital, but does not include the city. Regional governors
command large powers and automatically have a seat in the
country's Federation Council, or upper house of parliament.
</P>
<P>
The defeat of Seleznyov, a leader of the Russian Communist
Party, was seen as a setback for the party, which, despite a
strong showing in December's parliamentary election, is finding it
hard to appeal beyond its core supporters.
</P>
<P>
Gromov commanded Soviet forces at the last stage of Moscow's
invasion of Afghanistan. In 1989 he oversaw the pullout of troops
and was the last Soviet officer to leave Afghan soil.
</P>
<P>
In a statement released Monday, Gromov thanked the Moscow
region's electorate for their support.
</P>
<P>
"The victory is valuable to me first of all because I am an
ordinary man like you," the Itar-Tass news agency quoted him as
saying.
</P>
<P>
Seleznyov, however, complained of irregularities in the ballot-
counting process, Tass reported.

<HEADLINE> Macao SAR Preparatory Committee Holds Last Meeting </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, January 10 (Xinhua) -- Members of the Preparatory
Committee for the Macao Special Administrative Region (SAR) today
held their last meeting, attended by top Chinese leaders Jiang
Zemin, Li Peng, Zhu Rongji, Li Ruihuan, Hu Jintao, Wei Jianxing
and Li Lanqing.
</P>
<P>
President Jiang Zemin said he appreciated the committee's work
over the year. He said the committee has played an important role
in the successful establishment of the Macao SAR and Macao's
smooth handover.
</P>
<P>
Macao's return to the motherland is another big event in China'
s history, succeeding Hong Kong's return. Gone are the days of
China being overridden by foreign powers, Jiang said.
</P>
<P>
The president pointed out it was China's development and
stability that ensured the smooth transition.
</P>
<P>
The "one country, two systems" policy put forward by late
leader Deng Xiaoping has directed the future of Hong Kong and
Macao and will make Taiwan's return possible, the president said.
</P>
<P>
He believed that Macao people will try their best to build an
even more beautiful region in the new century.
</P>
<P>
Jiang also expressed his hope that the committee members will
continue their efforts to support the work of the Macao SAR
government, led by Chief Executive Ho Hau Wah, and contribute to
the region's long-term development and stability.
</P>
<P>
Vice-Premier Qian Qichen, chairman of the Preparatory Committee,
and Chief Executive Ho Hau Wah of the Macao SAR government also
addressed the meeting.

<HEADLINE> Major News Items in Leading Israeli Newspapers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, January 10 (Xinhua) -- The following are major news
items in leading Israeli newspapers Monday.
</P>
<P>
The Jerusalem Post:
</P>
<P>
-- Both Syria and Israel responded positively to a seven-page U.
S.-formulated "working document" summing up positions in the peace
talks, U.S. State Department spokesman James Rubin said Sunday.
</P>
<P>
With the current round of talks expected to close Monday night,
four working committees held their first meeting Sunday to discuss
border, water, security, and normalization issues.
</P>
<P>
Haaretz:
</P>
<P>
-- The bridging proposal presented last week by the U.S. to the
Israeli and Syrian negotiating teams, which summarized areas of
accord and discord between the two sides, could become the basis
for an eventual "core agreement," U.S. State Department spokesman
James Rubin said.
</P>
<P>
But he said that Israel and Syria will face enormous decisions
and it should not be expected that those decisions are to be made
in a matter of days.
</P>
<P>
Maariv:
</P>
<P>
-- Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak has denied a report in
Sunday's London-based al-Hayat newspaper that, according to the U.
S. "working document," Israel has agreed to a full pullback from
the Golan Heights.
</P>
<P>
Barak's spokesman said that Israel will not present any concrete
position on the border issue until it receives clarifications on
security and normalization issues.
</P>
<P>
Yediot Aharonot:
</P>
<P>
-- Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak will launch an effort to
persuade his cabinet to back his nominee for Bank of Israel
governor, David Klein, who now heads the central bank's monetary
and foreign currency divisions.
</P>
<P>
A key part of Barak's campaign will be to win the votes of four
Shas ministers. They are now leaning toward voting against Klein,
who is perceived as hawkish on monetary policy as outgoing governor
Jacob Frenkel.

<HEADLINE> Asia Pacific Parliamentary Forum Meeting Opens in  Australia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, January 10 (Xinhua) -- Parliamentarians from more
than 20 countries gathered here on Monday for the opening of the
8th Annual Meeting of the Asia Pacific Parliamentary Forum (APPF).
</P>
<P>
Opening the forum, Australian Governor-General Sir William
Deane said he hoped the three-day meeting would renew and develop
national friendships.
</P>
<P>
"I am confident that it will, like previous meetings, be a
significant force in promoting the region's stability and welfare
and for the advancement of the economic and social well-being both
of the member countries of the region and of their people," Deane
said.
</P>
<P>
In his speech at the opening ceremony, APPF President and
former Japanese prime minister Yasuhiro Nakasone cited India-
Pakistan tensions, DNA cloning and Japanese natural disasters as
subjects of particular interest to him.
</P>
<P>
At the annual meeting, delegates will discuss issues including
East Timor, the Korean Peninsula, nuclear and missile
proliferation in the Asian region, drugs, money laundering and
debt relief for poor countries.
</P>
<P>
The APPF is a loosely-structured forum of national
parliamentarians and was founded by Nakasone.
</P>
<P>
First staged in Tokyo in 1993, the forum seeks to provide
opportunities for national parliamentarians of the Asia Pacific
region to identify and discuss matters of common concern and
interest and to highlight them in a global context.
</P>
<P>
It also seeks to examine the critical political, social and
cultural developments resulting from economic growth and
integration and to encourage and promote regional cooperation at
all levels.

<HEADLINE> Manila Dismisses Fears Against Deployment of Marines </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, January 10 (Xinhua) -- The Philippine government
dismissed Monday fears aired against the plan to deploy Marines in
Metro Manila, saying it does not mean the miniaturization of the
metropolis which has a population of millions.
</P>
<P>
In a press release, Presidential Spokesman Jerry Barican said
the move is not an impeachable offense, adding that the
apprehensions were raised by "those who do not understand the
intent" and the mechanisms involved in the deployment of the
marines.
</P>
<P>
Earlier, Senator Juan Ponce Enrile warned that the deployment
of Marines could open Philippine President Joseph Estrada to
impeachment moves, saying it could endanger general political and
economic climate, sending wrong signals to foreign and domestic
investors.
</P>
<P>
Barican said the point raised by Enrile is baseless, as he
explained that the 1,000 Marines deployed in Metro Manila will not
be making the arrests, but will simply be assisting policemen in
their drive against criminality.
</P>
<P>
He said the Marines will be dressed in khakis and will not be
allowed to carry long arms as they do in battle, but will instead
have side arms.
</P>
<P>
"This does not constitute miniaturization, except to those who
do not understand the intent" of the plan, Barican said, as he
noted that even the Senate and the House of Representatives employ
Marines to secure the premises of their buildings.
</P>
<P>
He added that Marines have also been tapped to provide security
in other offices of some government agencies, but no objection has
been raised against the move.
</P>
<P>
Barican expressed optimism that the deployment of the Marines
could help ensure peace and stability and put an end to petty
crimes committed around shopping malls.
</P>
<P>
"The Marines is a highly disciplined unit," he said, adding
that these groups could serve well the government's peace and
order programs.

KAMPALA, January 10 (Xinhua) -- Cholera has claimed a total of
2,267 lives in Uganda since outbreak in 1997, a report from the
Ministry of Health said.
</P>
<P>
The National Cholera Task Force said in the report that 228 of

cholera in that year compared with 41 in 1998.

<P>
Though 52,000 people have survived the disease, cholera
persisted because of poverty and poor hygiene that is the most

<HEADLINE> S. Korean GDP Recovers to Pre-crisis Level in 1999 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SEOUL, January 10 (Xinhua) -- South Korea was the only one
nation to have its gross domestic product (GDP) recover to pre-
crisis levels among crisis-hit Asian countries last year.
</P>
<P>
In a Monday report on the comparison of the economic activities
between 1997-1999, the Finance and Economy Minister said that
South Korea's GDP, in the first nine months of last year,
registered 102 percent of that of 1997's figure when a financial
crisis had not yet spread nationwide.
</P>
<P>
However, the GDPs of other Asian countries, such as Thailand,
Indonesia and Malaysia, stood at 86-97 percent.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, South Korea's industrial output and shipments from
warehouses posted 112 percent and 114 percent of that of the same
time of 1997. In exports, the 1999 performance amounted to 106
percent of 1997.
</P>
<P>
Earlier this month, the Organization of Economic Cooperation
and Development (OECD) described the South Korean economy as a
model of a nation which has successfully overcome the crisis,
which began to grippe the country in November 1997 due to
corporate failures and bad loans of financial institutions in late
1997.

<TEXT>
<P>
SEOUL, January 10 (Xinhua) -- South Korea has earmarked 5.34
trillion won (about 4.66 billion U.S. dollars) for military
programs this year, including the introduction of air-to-ground
Harpy guided missiles, said a spokesman of the Defense Ministry
Monday.
</P>
<P>
The figure accounts for 37 percent of the nation's total
defense budget of 14.44 trillion won (one dollar equals to 1,100
won) for the fiscal year 2000.
</P>
<P>
"To help improve our military's striking force, we will spend a
total of 1.45 trillion won on 38 projects this year, including 60
billion won for the introduction of some 100 air-to-ground Harpy
guided missiles," said the spokesman.
</P>
<P>
The Israeli-made Harpy missiles are capable of striking any
anti-air missile radar within a radius of 150 kilometers after
remaining airborne for four to six hours.
</P>
<P>
Other major programs to enhance striking force will include the
acquisition of large-caliber multiple launching rocket systems and
surface-to-surface, surface-to-air, air-to-ground guided missiles.
</P>
<P>
The ministry has also set aside 230 billion won (one dollar
equals to 1,100 won) to improve the military strategic
intelligence and battlefield surveillance capability, with
installing a long-range radar on Ulnung Island which can cover an
area within a radius of 500 kilometers.
</P>
<P>
For bettered basic and mandatory force capability, the ministry
has decided to invest 1.3 trillion won (one dollar equals to 1,100
won) in 58 projects this year, including the acquisition of K-9
155 mm self-propelled artillery and new minesweepers.
</P>
<P>
Among the programs will cover those for the reinforcement of
operational bases, ammunition and combat equipment acquisition,
and training equipment modernization.
</P>
<P>
In addition, the spokesman said the ministry will use 310
billion won (one dollar equals to 1,100 won) on 32 research and
development projects concerning next-generation weapon systems.

<HEADLINE> French Truckers Block Road Border Entries </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, January 10 (Xinhua) -- French truckers began blocking
from Monday morning several road border entries with Germany,
Switzerland, Italy, Belgium and Spain to protest the 35-hour work
week law of the Socialist government.
</P>
<P>
At Lauterbourg on the French-German border, all lorries from
Germany were blocked, said officials of the public highway
authorities.
</P>
<P>
The French truckers, who stage blockade nearly every winter,
are unhappy with the government's 35-hour work week law which is
coming into force this year.
</P>
<P>
But this year's blockade is organized by the employers rather
than the unions.
</P>
<P>
Truckers formed a blockade in Saint-Louis at the road border
entry with Switzerland, as well as at Huningue, Ottmarsheim and
Neif-Brisach on the German border, said the National Federation of
Road Transportation.
</P>
<P>
In Biriatou on the French-Spanish border, truckers opened a
leeway for some vehicles after reaching an agreement with the
local authorities, that allowed them to block all lorries from
entering France until mid-day Monday.
</P>
<P>
Truckers also blocked the access to the tunnel of Frejus on the
French-Italian border, causing an eight kilometer long traffic jam,
said police.
</P>
<P>
In Rekkem on the French-Belgian border, about 400 trucks were
blocked from entering France mid-night Sunday.

<HEADLINE> mee011001 hke -- Over 69 Moderate Parliamentarian Hopefuls Barred from Polls in Iran </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, January 10 (Xinhua) -- Iran's conservative-dominated
supervisory board has barred at least 69 pro-reformist
parliamentarian hopefuls in Tehran constituency from running in the
polls next month, local daily Iran News reported Monday.
</P>
<P>
Informed sources told the paper on Sunday that those who were
disqualified are mainly outspoken journalists, clerics and members
of the opposition Freedom Movement of Iran.
</P>
<P>
The board assigned by the hardline Guardians Council has
informed the pro-moderate Interior Ministry of the move, but the
names of those disqualified would not be published unless upon
their formal request.
</P>
<P>
Moderate newspapers reported that the board even denied the
rights of 30 to 50 deputies in the present Majlis (parliament) from
running in the polls next month.
</P>
<P>
Under a law recently passed by the parliament, the Guardians
Council must provide written proof for any rejections and hear
complaints from disqualified candidates.
</P>
<P>
A total of 6,860 people have registered to run for the
parliamentary elections slated for February 18, and 6,459
candidates got their candidacy approved.
</P>
<P>
More than 30 moderate leaders last week voiced their deep
concern over the moves by the powerful conservatives, who dominate
most of the country's state organs, to bar prominent reformists
from running in the polling by screening qualifications of the
candidates.
</P>
<P>
The moderates in an open letter called on President Mohammad
Khatami to guarantee the fairness of the forthcoming parliamentary
elections.
</P>
<P>
"You should give warnings to all election officials to abide by
the law, in order to prevent any tensions or riots," the letter
said.
</P>
<P>
Newspapers said that the Guardians Council, which is empowered
to supervise elections, has tightened the screening process with
stricter conditions, such as participation in pro-Islamic
demonstrations and mass Friday prayers.
</P>
<P>
However, Iran's supreme leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei on
Saturday turned down the complaints by the moderates and urged the
moderates and conservatives to settle their disputes under relevant
laws.
</P>
<P>
"In case of any difference of opinion between the Interior
Ministry as the executive body and the Guardians Council as the
supervisory body of the elections, they should solve them among
themselves," said Khamenei Saturday at a prayers congregation to
mark the end of the Islamic fasting month of Ramadan.
</P>
<P>
Terming the polling as "sensitive," both the conservatives and
moderates have launched their campaigns months ago to win more
seats in the next Majlis.
</P>
<P>
The conservatives expect to maintain their majority in the
Majlis while the moderates are willing to grasp more seats to pave
the way for the political reforms advocated by President Khatami.

<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, January 10 (Xinhua) -- Two rebels were killed and 10
government soldiers were wounded from last Saturday to Monday in
the fighting between the Philippine government troops and the
separatist Moro Islamic Liberation Front (MILF), reports said
Monday.
</P>
<P>
According to the official Philippine News Agency (PNA), the
fighting started in Maguindanao province in the southern
Philippines hours after Muslims culminated last Saturday heir
Ramadan, Islam faithful month-long fasting season.
</P>
<P>
On Monday, MILF rebels blocked a critical stretch of highway in
Maguindanao province, denying commuters as their fighting against
government troops escalated.
</P>
<P>
The PNA said MILF rebels also flagged down several private
vehicles to serve as "shield" against advancing government forces
along the highway.
</P>
<P>
However, the owners of the seized vehicles were released later
by the rebels, said the PNA.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, reports from ABS-CBN TV station said thousands of
residents in Maguindaao province have fled their homes due the
escalating fighting.
</P>
<P>
Observers fear the new encounter would hamper anew the peace
talks between the government and the MILF which are due to resume
on January 17.

<HEADLINE> Vietnam Boosts Agro-forestry Produce Processing  Industry </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HANOI, January 10 (Xinhua) -- Vietnam has been attaching
importance to the development of the agro-forestry produce
processing industry and has made progress in the field.
</P>
<P>
Vietnam's agro-forestry produce processing enterprises obtained
a total output value of more than 374.67 million U.S. dollars in
1999, an increase of 12 percent over 1998, according to a report
of Vietnam News Agency Monday.
</P>
<P>
Value of processed outputs of food, coffee, rubber, fruit and
vegetable posted year-on-year increases ranging from 8 percent to
20 percent.
</P>
<P>
The agricultural sector exported 4.5 million tons of rice in
1999, 700,000 tons more than 1998.
</P>
<P>
It also exported 460,000 tons of coffee for 644 million dollars,
260,000 tons of rubber for 151.6 million dollars, 16,120 tons of
cashew nuts for 98 million dollars, 36,000 tons of tea for 46.6
million dollars, 57,000 tons of ground nuts for 35 million
dollars, and 4,217 tons of meat for 6.44 million dollars.
</P>
<P>
To further boost development of the agro-forestry produce
processing industry, Vietnam's Ministry of Agriculture and Rural
Development (MARD has devised many projects on farm and forestry
produce processing.
</P>
<P>
To carry out the national program of 1 million tons of sugar
this year, MARD has operated 41 out of 44 sugar mills throughout
the country, and increased sugarcane growing area in 1999 by 20
percent and sugar output by 37 percent.
</P>
<P>
It has instructed agricultural and rural development services
in 12 northern mountain provinces to implement plans for tea
production in the 1999-2000 crop, and to plant 10,000 hectares of
tea and import 2 million tea cuttings from China, India, and Sri
Lanka to produce new high-yield strains.
</P>
<P>
Besides, one million hectares in the Mekong Delta and another
300,000 hectares in the Red River Delta were zoned off to grow
rice for export last year.

<HEADLINE> Clinton's Meeting With Barak, Shara Ends With No Result </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHEPHERDSTOWN, W. Va., January 9 (Xinhua) -- President Bill
Clinton's intervention in the bogged-down Syrian-Israeli
negotiations on Sunday night appeared to be another failure in his
attempt to keep the peace talks to be moving forward.
</P>
<P>
Mike Hammer, White House's spokesman, said after Clinton's two-
and-half-hour meeting with Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak and
Syrian Foreign Minister Farouk al-Shara, that "no decision has
been made whether the president will come back tomorrow."
</P>
<P>
Earlier, when Clinton was holding a trilateral meeting with
Barak and Shara, another White House spokesman Joe Lockhart
already seemed to have expected that result, by telling reporters
that issues being negotiated "are difficult and complex."
</P>
<P>
It was the fifth time within a week that Clinton flew to the
West Virginian reclusive town of Shepherdstown to intervene in the
discussions, having moved nowhere because of procedural dispute
between Syria and Israel.
</P>
<P>
Before Clinton's departure for Shepherdstown, a U.S. official
said Clinton planned "to meet with the parties, to take stock of
where we are and to keep urging the process forward."
</P>
<P>
"Tonight might not be the final moment of presidential
involvement in this round. If called for, he could still do
something tomorrow morning," he said.
</P>
<P>
Asked how the talks were going as he walked to his helicopter
at the White House to travel to Shepherdstown, Clinton said simply,
"Well."
</P>
<P>
Israeli Prime Minister Barak planned to leave for home on
Monday. He was led by Secretary of State Madeleine Albright on
Sunday for a tour of an American Civil War battlefield at Antietam
Creek. Asked about the peace talks with Syria, Barak called them a
tough battle.
</P>
<P>
"There is no doubt it will be a tough diplomatic battle. It is
impossible now to forecast how long it will last, or the results,"
he said.
</P>
<P>
Syria has insisted that Israel withdraws from the Golan Heights
to the line of June 4, 1967, on the eve of the Middle East war.
Such a pullback would put Syria on the edge of the Sea of Galilee,
which Israel takes as a main water reservoir.
</P>
<P>
Israel has said the depth of its pullback would be determined
by the scope of security arrangements and peaceful ties.
</P>
<P>
Any progress that the peace talks could make depends upon the
core issue, which, however, shows no sign to be immediately solved.
</P>
<P>
U.S. State Department spokesman James Rubin, asked for the main
achievement of the first week of the talks, said, "We have
developed a work pace that allows us to hold out hope that a core
agreement can be reached. Whether it will be achieved is an open
question."
</P>
<P>
"We don't think it should drag out for years, but we do
understand that these are very monumental decisions that will take
time," he said.
</P>
<P>
The Syrians and Israelis are now focusing their attention on a
U.S.-drafted "working document", presented by Clinton on Friday to
Barak and Syrian Foreign Minister Farouk al-Shara.
</P>
<P>
Rubin said Monday would be a full working day for the
negotiators. After that, the program is uncertain.

<HEADLINE> Top Chinese Bank Increases Fixed Asset Investment Loans </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, January 10 (Xinhua) -- The Industrial and Commercial
Bank of China (ICBC), the country's largest commercial bank,
increased its loans to fixed asset investment projects in 1999.
</P>
<P>
A bank spokesman said the ICBC loaned a total of 110 billion
yuan in 1999 to fixed asset investment projects, including 57
billion yuan to road, power, telecommunications and other
infrastructure projects, and 53 billion yuan to those for
technical upgrading.
</P>
<P>
The spokesman said a large proportion of the bank's loans went
to technical upgrading projects in key industries and key
enterprises, as well as works involving the production of key
industrial equipment.
</P>
<P>
The bank also extended its support to the industrialization of
high technologies. For example, its loans to several mobile phone
developers in Beijing, Shenzhen and Xiamen will help China acquire
the technology for the production of key parts and thus sharpen
the country's competitive edge in the international market, the
spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
In the sector of infrastructure, the bank has since 1998
provided 40 billion yuan in loans to 65 highway projects involving
a total mileage of 4,500 kilometers.
</P>
<P>
According the spokesman, the bank will increase its loans for
the improvement of old industrial bases and the development of the
western regions in 2000.
</P>
<P>
It will also increase loans in both RMB and foreign currencies
to non-state-owned enterprises and foreign-funded enterprises, as
well as loans to non-production and non-circulating projects, the
spokesman said.

<HEADLINE> Chinese President Meets U.S. Congressmen </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, January 10 (Xinhua) -- Chinese President Jiang Zemin
met with a group of U.S. congressmen here this morning at the
Great Hall of the People, with each side stressing that mutual
understanding between China and the United States is a must if
their relationship is to grow.
</P>
<P>
The group, who are here as guests of the Chinese People's
Institute of Foreign Affairs (CPIFA), was led by Matt Salmon.
Sander Levin, another U.S. congressman invited by CPIFA, also
attended the meeting.
</P>
<P>
Jiang said that at the turn of the century, the development
process of the Sino-U.S. relationship demonstrated that the growth
of the healthy ties between these two influential countries is not
only in their common interests but also conducive to world peace,
stability and development.
</P>
<P>
He said that all far-sighted statesmen should have a clear
understanding of this historic tide and go along with it. In the
new millennium, both sides should recognize and deal appropriately
with developments that are in the fundamental interests of both
the Chinese and American peoples and the people in the world, with
"wisdom, strength and a strategic perspective."
</P>
<P>
Jiang pointed out that the Sino-U.S. relationship is now in a
pivotal phase with both good opportunities and challenges ahead. "
As long as the three Sino-U.S. joint communiques and the
commitments made by the U.S. side can be strictly observed, and
the Taiwan issue and other key issues be properly handled, Sino-U.
S. ties will see steady improvement and development," he said.
</P>
<P>
Jiang also stressed the need to further the mutual
understanding between the two countries. He again called the
bilateral agreement signed by China and U.S. on China's accession
into the World Trade Organization (WTO) a "win-win" deal, which is
beneficial for the all-round growth of Sino-U.S. economic and
trade cooperation.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese president hoped U.S. congressmen will be active in
the development of bilateral trade relations and the improvement
and growth of bilateral ties in general.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. congressmen expressed their admiration to China's long
history and its current thriving economy. They believed that the
growth of the U.S.-China relationship is significant for the two
countries and the future of the world.
</P>
<P>
They also pledged they would actively support the U.S.-China
deal on China's WTO entry and agreed to make continuous efforts
for the realization of permanent normal trade relations with China
for the sound development of U.S.-China relations.

HARARE, January 10 (Xinhua) -- The Zimbabwean government pays
100 million Zimbabwean dollars (2.6 million U.S. dollars) in
interest daily to service part of its domestic debt, the daily
Herald reported on Monday.
</P>
<P>
The interest is paid on short to medium-term Treasury Bills
issued by the government to raise money to fund its temporary
requirements.
</P>
<P>
Interest on Treasury Bills has more than doubled over the past
two years in line with the prevailing high rates of inflation and
the general decline in the economic environment.
</P>
<P>
The interest rate has shot to around 60 percent from 28 percent
as of September 1998. This means that the government is now
paying more than twice as much interest on Treasury Bills as it
did in September 1998.
</P>
<P>
"Rising domestic debts is a major factor behind the current
high interest rate environment, which is negatively impacting on
private sector investment," the DiscounT@=HZ.H,]9rently at 61.2 percent, while minimum lending

<P>
WELLINGTON, January 10 (Xinhua) -- New Zealanders experienced
the second warmest year on record in 1999.
</P>
<P>
The National Institute of Water and Atmospheric Research (NIWA)
of New Zealand Monday said in a media release that the last year
of the millennium was one of extreme variations, with the country
experiencing heat waves in five months and 16 separate floods.
</P>
<P>
It said the average temperature nationwide was 13.3 degrees
Celsius, which is marginally down on the record set in 1998.
</P>
<P>
Invercargill, the southernmost part of New Zealand's South
Island, had its sunniest year since records began in 1914 while
Wellington, the country's capital, was the sunniest of the four
main centers, ahead of Christchurch, Auckland and Dunedin.
</P>
<P>
The La Nina weather pattern dominated the early part of the
year and was responsible for the warm dry weather.

WELLINGTON, January 10 (Xinhua) -- New Zealand, a country with
a population of 3.8 million, has 2.7 million licensed drivers and
2,485,730 licensed vehicles.
</P>
<P>
The ratio of 65 vehicles for every 100 people in the country is
one of the highest in the world, just after the United States.
</P>
<P>
Briefing papers prepared by the New Zealand Land Transport
Safety Authority for Transport Minister Mark Gosche said Monday
that there is about 91,900 kilometers of road in the country, an
unusually large amount for the population it serves.
</P>
<P>
The road toll had fallen from a peak of 795 in 1987 to 502
deaths in 1998, after the introduction of compulsory breath
testing, speed cameras and graphic advertisements," the papers
said.
</P>
<P>
"Despite the successes shown, the road toll has fluctuated over
the last three years around an arithmetic average of 518 deaths,"
the papers said.
</P>
<P>
New Zealand's road accident statistics rate it among the worst,
at 21, in the 28-member Organization of Economic Cooperation and
Development countries.
</P>
<P>
According to the papers, alcohol, speeding and not wearing a
seat belt contributed greatly to the fatal crashes.

BANGKOK, January 10 (Xinhua) -- Indonesia will remain the

<HEADLINE> 10-Hour Family Siege in Australia Ends Peacefully </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, January 10 (Xinhua) -- A man surrendered to police in
Perth, Western Australia state, on Monday after allegedly shooting
his wife in the arm and holding five members of his family hostage
overnight.
</P>
<P>
The 38-year-old man was being questioned by police, who said
they expected to lay charges later Monday.
</P>
<P>
The man's wife was hospitalized overnight with a flesh wound to
the arm, but nobody else was hurt during the 10-and-a-half-hour
stand-off.
</P>
<P>
Senior Sergeant Glen Potter from the tactical response group
said the siege began shortly after 10 p.m. Sunday when police
received an emergency call from a woman who said she had been shot.
</P>
<P>
When they arrived police found the woman outside her house with
a gunshot wound to her arm.
</P>
<P>
However, they were prevented from entering the house by the
woman's husband who they said was armed with a rifle.
</P>
<P>
Also inside the house were the couple's four children aged
between seven and 17 and the man's 69-year-old father.
</P>
<P>
Potter said police negotiators worked throughout the night to
help resolve the situation.
</P>
<P>
He said the man was distressed and had been involved in
extensive talks with negotiators by telephone.
</P>
<P>
The dispute was domestic in nature and the man had not
threatened his children, he said.
</P>
<P>
The man had made no demands and had not threatened police,
Potter added.

<HEADLINE> UN Envoy Ends Mission in Cambodia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PHNOM PENH, January 10 (Xinhua) -- The U.N. secretary-general
personal representative in Cambodia, Lakhan Mehrotra, was received
by National Assembly President Prince Norodom Ranariddh and Prime
Minister Hun Sen Monday before he ends his more than two years of
mission here.
</P>
<P>
In his speech at the farewell reception at the National
Assembly, Prince Narariddh warmly praised the role played by
Mehrotra and the United Nations as a whole in Cambodia's peace and
national reconciliation.
</P>
<P>
"He is not only a great pillar in peace coordination and
cooperation with international community members, with the king,
and with all political leaders in Cambodia, but also a real
architect of the new peace settlement process and national
reconciliation," Ranariddh said.
</P>
<P>
"With his accomplished mission, Mehrotra has really given hope
to the Cambodian people to rebuild a new future," he added.
</P>
<P>
Many parliamentarians and some diplomatic envoys in Cambodia
were also present at the reception.
</P>
<P>
Mehrotra went to meet with Prime Minister Hun Sen after the
farewell reception. The prime minister also expressed his thanks
to Mehrotra for his works in Cambodia.
</P>
<P>
The U.N. office was opened about six years ago by the then U.N.
Secretary-General Boutros Boutros-Ghali when the U.N. Transitional
Authority in Cambodia ended its peacekeeping mission here in late
1993.
</P>
<P>
The purpose of the office when it was set up was to monitor
security and human rights and serve as a liaison with the
Cambodian government.
</P>
<P>
Hun Sen said, "Now that security has been returned to the
country, the office's mandate has run its course."
</P>
<P>
"The Cambodian permanent representative to the U.N. can take
all responsibility for relations with the U.N., without the U.N.
special representative in Cambodia," said Hun Sen.
</P>
<P>
The U.N. office was formally closed on December 31 at the
request of the Cambodian government which has said it was no
longer needed.
</P>
<P>
Mehrotra will leave Phnom Penh on Wednesday and his next post
is Jakarta.

<HEADLINE> Nepali Economy Expected to Grow by 6 Percent </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KATHMANDU, January 10 (Xinhua) -- After a slowdown over the
past five years, Nepal's economy is expected to bounce back with a
growth rate of about 6 percent, bolstered by robust growths in the
agricultural sector and foreign trade, The Kathmandu Post reported
Monday.
</P>
<P>
The half-yearly estimates of the gross domestic product (GDP)
by the Central Bureau of Statistics put the expansion of the
economy at an impressive 5.5 to 6 percent in the current fiscal
year ending mid-July 2000, the English daily said.
</P>
<P>
If this projection is realized, it will be the first time that
the GDP targets set by the Ninth Five-year Plan ending 2002 will
be materialized.
</P>
<P>
The Nepali economy grew by an average 3.6 percent in the last
five years. It slipped to the low equilibrium after attaining a
growth of 7.9 percent, a record high in 15 years, in the fiscal
year 1993/94.
</P>
<P>
The major boost to the economy this year comes from the
agricultural sector, which is expected to grow by 4 percent point
or more for the first time in five years. Other sectors are
expected to grow by more than 7 percent.
</P>
<P>
The agricultural sector, which contributes more than 40 percent
of the GDP, grew by a meager 1.1 percent last year.
</P>
<P>
Though the agricultural sector is on the steering, it is the
upturn in manufacturing activities, foreign trade and development
expenditure that has played a key role in the economic recovery.
</P>
<P>
All these sectors are developing in a positive direction in the
first quarter of the current fiscal year: Export is growing by
more than 30 percent, import 35 percent, the manufacturing index
about 10 percent and development expenditure an average of 35
percent.
</P>
<P>
What's more encouraging, the expected high growth for this year
is likely to be attained at a low level of inflation. The Urban
Consumer Price Index already subsided to a historic low of 2
percent from around 10 percent at the beginning of the current
fiscal year.
</P>
<P>
Experts hope that the macroeconomic stability reinforced by low
inflation and political stability would secure a long-term
economic revival in Nepal.

<TEXT>
<P>
NEW DELHI, January 10 (Xinhua) -- India's inflation rate
declined by 0.2 percent to touch 2.93 percent on December 23, 1999,
triggered by a drastic drop in vegetable prices.
</P>
<P>
According to the Reserve Bank of India, the inflation has come
down after touching a 27-week-high of 3.13 percent in the previous
week.
</P>
<P>
The inflation rate during the corresponding week in 1998 was 5.
34 percent.
</P>
<P>
The lower rate of inflation during most parts of 1999 was
mainly on account of a comparison with a higher base in 1998 when
overall prices were up following an abnormal increase in vegetable
prices.

WASHINGTON, January 9 (Xinhua) -- Already with the second-worst
record in the NBA, the Golden State Warriors got some more bad
news on Sunday when they placed forward Chris Mills and guard John
Starks on the injured list.
</P>
<P>
Mills, the team's second-leading scorer, underwent surgery on
his right ankle on December 29 and has missed the last three games.
There is no timetable for his return.
</P>

manager Garry St. Jean on December 27, have the worst record in
the Western Conference at 6-26 and are in the midst of an eight-
game losing streak. Five of those losses have come under St. Jean.

with tendinitis in his left knee. He is the third on the club in
scoring, averaing 15.1 points in 26 games.
</P>

<HEADLINE> Businessmen Behind Conspiracy to Kill S. Lankan President: Reports </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
COLOMBO, January 10 (Xinhua) -- A group of top-rung businessmen
were directly linked to an alleged conspiracy to assassinate Sri
Lankan President Chandrika Kumaratunga last month, press reports
here said Monday.
</P>
<P>
Those businessmen, angered by their failure to clinch
government tenders and gain other financial benefits, extended
their support to the main opposition United National Party during
last month's presidential election, said the reports.
</P>
<P>
To achieve their own objectives, they also planned the
conspiracy in collaboration with the separatist Liberation Tigers
of Tamil Eelam(LTTE), said the reports.
</P>
<P>
The LTTE has been fighting for a homeland for minority Tamils
in Sri Lanka's north and east since 1983.
</P>
<P>
The government has blamed the LTTE for the suicide bomb attack
on Kumaratunga on December 18 at her final presidential election
rally in Colombo.
</P>
<P>
Kumaratunga had said she lost eyesight in her right eye due to
the bomb attack which killed 24 people and wounded more than 100
others.
</P>
<P>
The Criminal Investigations Department (CID) was continuing to
look into the conspiracy and more startling revelations will be
expected within the next few days, the reports said.
</P>
<P>
The CID has taken in Renuka Shanmuganathan, the wife of a
millionaire businessman, for questioning in connection with the
conspiracy.
</P>
<P>
CID sources claimed that they were on the trail of the
conspiracy group which also included two private newspapers'
editors and some army officials who wanted to set up a military
regime in the island country.

<HEADLINE> Clinton Makes Fifth Intervention in Syrian-Israeli Talks </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHEPHERDSTOWN, W. Va., January 9 (Xinhua) -- U.S. President
Bill Clinton re-entered the Syrian-Israeli peace talks late on
Sunday in an attempt to keep almost stalled negotiations to move
forward.
</P>
<P>
It was the fifth time within a week that Clinton flew to the
West Virginian reclusive town of Shepherdstown to intervene in the
talks moving nowhere because of procedural dispute between Syria
and Israel.
</P>
<P>
A U.S. official said Clinton planned "to meet with the parties,
to take stock of where we are and to keep urging the process
forward."
</P>
<P>
"Tonight (Sunday night) might not be the final moment of
presidential involvement in this round. If called for, he could
still do something tomorrow morning," the official said before
Clinton flew in by helicopter from Washington.
</P>
<P>
Asked how the talks were going as he walked to his helicopter
at the White House to fly to Shepherdstown, Clinton said simply: "
Well."
</P>
<P>
Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak, who was led by U.S.
Secretary of State Madeleine Albright on Sunday for a tour of an
American Civil War battlefield at Antietam Creek, planned to leave
for home on Monday.
</P>
<P>
Describing the peace talks with Syria as a tough diplomatic
battle, Barak said: "It is impossible now to forecast how long it
will last, or the results."
</P>
<P>
Syria has insisted that Israel withdraw from the Golan Heights
to the line set on June 4, 1967, on the eve of the Middle East war.
Such a pullback would put Syria on the edge of the Sea of Galilee,
which Israel takes as a main water reservoir.
</P>
<P>
Israel has said the depth of its pullback would be determined
by the scope of security arrangements and peaceful ties.
</P>
<P>
Any progress that the peace talks could make depends upon this
core issue, which, however, shows no sign of being immediately
solved.
</P>
<P>
Asked about the main achievement of the first week of the talks,
U.S. State Department spokesman James Rubin said: "We have
developed a work pace that allows us to hold out hope that a core
agreement can be reached. Whether it will be achieved is an open
question."
</P>
<P>
"We don't think it should drag out for years, but we do
understand that these are very monumental decisions that will take
time," he added.
</P>
<P>
The Syrians and Israelis are now focusing their attention on a
U.S.-drafted "working document," presented by Clinton on Friday to
Barak and Syrian Foreign Minister Farouk al-Shara.
</P>
<P>
Rubin said Monday would be a full working day for the
negotiators. After that, the program is uncertain.

YANGON, January 10 (Xinhua) -- Myanmar produced 3,089 tons of
cotton yarn in the first eight months of 1999, 29.62 percent more
than the 2,383 tons produced in the same period of 1998.
</P>
<P>
According to the latest data published by the Central
Statistical Organization, Myanmar also produced 10,703,854 meters
of cotton fabrics in the eight-month period, up 61 percent over
the same period of 1998 which saw a production of 6,646,608 meters.
</P>
<P>
In 1998, Myanmar produced 3,913 tons of cotton yarn and 10,889,
415 meters of cotton fabrics.

<P>
Myanmar's annual cultivated area of cotton is 283,500 hectares
while the annual production of ginned cotton stands at 160,000
tons, of which long-staple cotton accounts for 82 percent.
</P>
<P>
To maintain the enthusiasm of cotton growers and relieve the

<HEADLINE> Electric Power Production Drops in Myanmar </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
YANGON, January 10 (Xinhua) -- Electric power generated by the
state-run Myanmar Electric Power Enterprise (MEPE), the main
electricity supplier of the country, totaled 2.722 billion
kilowatt-hours (kwh) in the first eight months of 1999, a 6.84-
percent drop from a year earlier.
</P>
<P>
According to the latest figures of the official Economic
Indicators, the installed capacity of the MEPE was 1,058 megawatts
(mw) at the end of August 1999.
</P>
<P>
The figures also show that in 1998, the MEPE produced a total
of 4.279 billion kwh of electricity.
</P>
<P>
Other official statistics indicate that the MEPE added a total
installed capacity of 509 mw in the past 11 years, of which
natural gas power plants represented 255 mw while steam power
plants took up 143 mw and hydro-electric power plants 111 mw.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Myanmar is building five more hydro-electric power
plants -- Paunglaung, Zaungtu, Mone, Thaphanseik and Maipan. Of
them, Paunglaung, Mone and Thanphanseik are being built by China.
</P>
<P>
These five power plants, upon completion, will add 407 mw more
to Myanmar's installed generating capacity and thus ease the
serious electricity shortage in the country.

</P>
<P>
Executive Chairman Kristiono of the Indonesian Forestry

<HEADLINE> Philippine Forex Reserves Hit 15B Dollars in 1999 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, January 10 (Xinhua) -- The Philippines' gross
international reserves (GIR) last year amounted to 15 billion U.S.
dollars,exceeding the 14.7-billion-dollar target set by the
government for 1999, Philippine Daily Inquirer reported Monday.
</P>
<P>
The 1999 GIR was also 39 percent bigger than the previous year'
s 10.793 billion dollars, said the newspaper.
</P>
<P>
The paper quoted preliminary data from the Central Bank of the
Philippines as saying the higher-than-expected full-year figure
could be attributed to the huge dollar and other foreign currency
inflows during the holiday season.
</P>
<P>
The GIR consists of the central bank's holdings of gold,
special drawing rights from the International Monetary Fund,
foreign investment and foreign exchange.
</P>
<P>
The full-year GIR of 15 billion dollars is equivalent to
roughly three months' worth of interest and import payments.
</P>
<P>
A healthy GIR position helps boost investors' confidence in the
local economy since it demonstrates the country's ability to pay
for its imports and maturing obligations, the paper said.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the country's balance of payments surplus or BOP in
1999 was seen to hit 3.5 billion dollars, also higher than the
central bank's target of 3.2 billion dollars.
</P>
<P>
The central bank said the higher than expected BOP surplus is a
good indication that the economy is starting to recover. BOP
refers to the total foreign exchange transactions between the
domestic economy and the rest of the world.
</P>
<P>
For year 2000, the central bank is targeting to post a GIR of
17.4 billion dollars and a BOP surplus of 2.5 billion dollars, sad
the paper.

As a result, the two trains crashed 50 kilometers northeast
Hamar, leaving 19 people dead and more than 30 others injured.

<HEADLINE> Philippine Congress Opens Special Session </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, January 10 (Xinhua) -- The Philippine Senate and the
House of Representatives will start their special sessions later
Monday to discuss this year's 651-billion-peso (16.3 billion U.S.
dollars ) budget that has been stalled at the congress.
</P>
<P>
According to Manila Bulletin, the five-day special session
called by Philippine President Joseph Estrada will also take up
other pending priority bills earlier agreed upon by the
Legislative-Executive Development Advisory Council.
</P>
<P>
The deliberation of the year 2000 national budget bogged down
after the house refused to concede to the senate's version of the
national budget that has been reduced to 644 billion pesos (16.1
billion dollars) due to a projected huge budget deficit.
</P>
<P>
Senate leaders had justified their action by saying that the
revenue collection target of the government is unrealistic and
that if not resolved it will further bloat the country's budget
deficit to an unmanageable level.
</P>
<P>
The newspaper said congress leaders remain skeptical about
whether a bicameral committee could come up with a consolidated
version of the 2000 national budget.
</P>
<P>
Senate Finance Committee Chairman John Osmena had earlier said
it would be "useless and counterproductive" for both houses of
congress to hold a special session in the absence of a
consolidated bicameral conference committee report on the budget.
</P>
<P>
Representative Joker Arroyo said that if President Joseph
Estrada is not insisting on his request for the congress to fund
an additional 30 billion pesos (750 million dollars) in internal
revenue allotment for local governments, the budget can be
approved immediately.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Senator Gregorio Honasan asked congress leaders to
prioritize the passage into law of a joint resolution creating a
joint congressional oversight committee on the Philippines-U.S.
Visiting Forces Agreement.
</P>
<P>
Honasan noted that joint military exercises between American
and Filipino troops will resume early next month despite the
absence of the oversight committee that would monitor the conduct
of such exercises.

<HEADLINE> Roundup: Myanmar Endeavors for Polio Eradication by Duan Tingchang </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
YANGON, January 10 (Xinhua) -- Myanmar is a country uniquely
situated between polio-free countries (China and Laos) and those
with widespread poliovirus transmission (India and Bangladesh).
</P>
<P>
Myanmar, along with other countries in the world, is
endeavoring to eradicate polio by the year 2000 and has marked the
national immunization days (NIDs) for five consecutive years since
1995.
</P>
<P>
Millions of children under five in the country were given oral
polio vaccine (OPV) annually in these days.
</P>
<P>
In the first four years of Myanmar's NIDs, 5.33 million, 5.5
million, 5.503 million and 5.8 million children respectively
received polio immunization in 1995, 1996, 1997 and 1998,
attaining a coverage of above 95 percent in these years, according
to official statistics.
</P>
<P>
In the fifth year of the NIDs of which December 12, 1999, was
the first day and the second day will be January 16, 2000, a total
of 5.9 million children under five are expected to be covered.
</P>
<P>
For the implementation of NIDs in Myanmar, almost all basic
staff of the country's Ministry of Health are mobilized annually
to form tens of thousands of vaccination teams, reinforced by a
large number of volunteers estimated at 180,000.
</P>
<P>
The activities were also carried out with assistance and
cooperation, both technical and financial, from U.N. agencies such
as the World Health Organization, U.N. Children's Fund and U.N.
Development Program, Japanese, Australian and South Korean
governments and international non-governmental organizations.
</P>
<P>
The country's NIDs activities were launched simultaneously with
its neighbors such as Nepal, India, Bhutan, Bangladesh, the
Maldives, Thailand and China's Yunnan Province.
</P>
<P>
Myanmar has had four cross-border meetings with China, aimed at
coordinating polio eradication efforts.
</P>
<P>
Although there was no wild polio virus circulation reportedly
detected in Myanmar, the country is keeping a constant vigil for
possible importation of cases from polio-endemic countries in the
region.
</P>
<P>
For this purpose, additional "mop-up" campaigns were
implemented near the end of 1999 in high-risk border areas where
vaccination coverage is low and wild poliovirus is in circulation.
These campaigns will continue in the year 2000.
</P>
<P>
Myanmar is adopting four basic strategies to achieve the
eradication of poliomyelitis -- high levels of routine
immunization coverage for three doses of OPV, national
immunization days, a sensitive acute flaccid paralysis
surveillance system and mop-up immunization campaigns.
</P>
<P>
Since Myanmar targets to eradicate polio by the year 2000,
citizens in the country are being urged to ensure that every
Myanmar child is fully immunized before he is one year old and
every child under five gets an extra dose of OPV during the NIDs.

<HEADLINE> Myanmar's Fertilizer Output Up </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
YANGON, January 10 (Xinhua) -- Myanmar produced 101,185 tons of
chemical fertilizer in the first eight months of 1999, 39 percent
up over the same period of 1998, when the production was 72,759
tons, according to the latest figures of the Central Statistical
Organization.
</P>
<P>
The figures also show that in 1998, the country produced 112,
086 tons of fertilizer.
</P>
<P>
Myanmar has only three fertilizer plants, which produce
annually a total of about 120,000 tons of urea.
</P>
<P>
Myanmar needs 800,000 tons of chemical fertilizer annually and
its domestic production is not enough for meeting the demand. The
country has to import 680,000 tons of fertilizer annually which
accounts for 85 percent of the country's total demand.
</P>
<P>
Since January 1999, Myanmar has reclaimed more than 400,000
hectares of vacant, virgin, fallow and continuous increase of
cultivated areas, the demand for chemical fertilizer also grows,
hence the increased need for imports.
</P>
<P>
To develop agriculture, the Myanmar government has exempted
import duties on agricultural materials including chemical
fertilizer.

<HEADLINE> Maradona to Return to Argentina for Treatment </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BUENOS AIRES, January 9 (Xinhua) -- Argentinian football legend
Diego Maradona arrived back here Sunday evening, five days after
he started to receive treatment in Uruguay for an alleged cocaine
overdose.
</P>
<P>
Maradona boarded an ambulance plane at Laguna del Sauce, near
Punta del Este, 140km east of Montevideo with his wife Claudia
Villafane. The 39-year-old former Argentine World Cup skipper was
brought to the plane in an ambulance but was able to walk on board.
</P>
<P>
He touched down at the Argentine capital's Jorge Newbery
airport at 20.05 P.M. local time (2305 GMT), Argentine television
reported.
</P>
<P>
The former star was admitted to intensive care last Tuesday
with what was described by his doctor as a life-threatening heart
condition. Tests on Wednesday revealed he was suffering from a
cocaine overdose.
</P>
<P>
On Saturday, Maradona denied through his lawyer that he had
been on drugs in Uruguay. His lawyer said Maradona told him that
he had not taken drugs since coming to Uruguay at the New Year.
</P>
<P>
Maradona's doctor Alfredo Cahe will accompany him to the Fleni
clinic in the Argentine capital, where he is expected to undergo
intermediate care and further tests.
</P>
<P>
An extensive rehabilitation program was said to be worked out
for him. But it was yet to decide where it will take place.

<HEADLINE> U.N. Committee Blocks 23 Transportation Contracts: Iraq </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BGHDAD, January 10 (Xinhua) -- Iraq's Transportation Ministry
announced Monday that the U.N. Sanctions Committee had blocked the
approval of 23 contracts the ministry signed with foreign companies
under the oil-for-food program.
</P>
<P>
A spokesman for the ministry held the U.S. and British envoys at
the Sanctions Committee responsible for blocking those contracts
concluded with companies from France, Spain, India, Turkey,
Austria, China and Russia, the Iraqi News Agency reported.
</P>
<P>
The spokesman said those contracts were for the purchases of
crane spare parts and engines used in the railway sector, iron
wheels, strand iron, pillars and communication equipment.
</P>
<P>
He pointed out that the non-approval of those contracts had
severe impacts on the transportation sector as well as on the
delivery of foodstuffs, medicines and other humanitarian supplies
imported under the oil-for-food program.
</P>
<P>
The U.N. imposed harsh economic sanctions on Iraq in 1990
following its invasion of Kuwait. To alleviate the suffering of the
Iraqi people, the U.N. started to implement the oil-for-food
program in Iraq in December 1996.
</P>
<P>
Under the oil-for-food program now in its seventh phase, Iraq is
allowed to export 5.2 billion U.S. dollars worth of oil every six
months to buy humanitarian supplies for its people reeling under
the U.N. sanctions.
</P>
<P>
Most of the humanitarian goods imported by Iraq under the oil-
for-food deal arrive at Iraq's southern ports through sea line, and
then are transported to other parts of the country.
</P>
<P>
The spokesman said that like other sectors, the transportation
sector had suffered a lot due to the continuation of the U.N.
sanctions, and that the contracted items only represented minimum
need to rehabilitate this sector.
</P>
<P>
Baghdad has repeatedly accused the U.S. and British envoys at
the Sanctions Committee of deliberately blocking the approval of
its contracts and impeding the implementation of the humanitarian
program.

<HEADLINE> France Ready to Help on Cyprus Issue: French Official </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NICOSIA, January 10 (Xinhua) -- Michel Voisin, visiting chairman
of the French delegation to the Parliamentary Assembly of the
Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE),
expressed here Monday readiness to help in the settlement of the
Cyprus issue.
</P>
<P>
Voisin, together with Vice-Chairman of the French delegation
Jean-Claude Lefort, arrived here Monday on a three-day visit.
</P>
<P>
Speaking to press after a meeting with Cyprus President Glafcos
Clerides, Voisin said they discussed stability in the Mediterranean
region.
</P>
<P>
Stability and peace in the Mediterranean are a result of
economic cooperation among regional countries, he said.
</P>
<P>
Voisin also praised the "very close cooperation" between the
delegations of the two countries at the OSCE Parliamentary
Assembly, adding that this cooperation has often resulted in
positive amendments to various OSCE documents and declarations.
</P>
<P>
The two French parliamentarians also met with Speaker of Cyprus'
House of Representatives (parliament) Spyros Kyprianou.
</P>
<P>
Voisin said after the meeting that when France undertakes the
presidency of the European Union in the second half of 2000, it
will keep its promises regarding Cyprus.
</P>
<P>
"A solution can only come through a political settlement of the
issue," and should be based on the principles of the OSCE,
including security, economy and respect of human rights, Voisin
added.
</P>
<P>
Cyprus has been divided into Greek and Turkish Cypriot
communities since 1974 when Turkey invaded and occupied the
northern third of the island after a failed pro-Athens coup. 
</P>
<P>
United Nations-sponsored proximity talks between the two
communities were held last month in New York in an effort to pave
the way for finding a solution.

<HEADLINE> 32 Kidnappings Happen in Colombia This Year </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
According to the source of the 32 abductions, eight were by
guerrillas from Colombia's Revolutionary Armed Forces (FARC); five
by the Army of National Liberation (ELN) and the rest were by
common delinquents making themselves pass off as guerrillas. In
recent years 51 foreigners have been kidnapped, Americans and
Germans being those more vulnerable to abduction in the country.
</P>
<P>
The first case of a foreigner carried off this year is Spaniard
Angel Blanco Munoz, who seemingly is in ELN power, while it is
believed that American Robert Hunt, whose whereabouts have not
been known since last January 2, also was abducted. Furthermore,
on the National Army's list there appear Mexicans Oscar Contreras
Gutierrez, kidnapped on July 20, 1996, and Rodolfo Antonio de la

<HEADLINE> Belgium Starts Border Control For Amnesty </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BRUSSELS, January 10 (Xinhua) -- Belgium started Monday a three-
week border control in order to launch amnesty for some 70,000
illegal immigrants.
</P>
<P>
From now on, illegal immigrants in Belgium can register for
residence permits if they meet certain requirements.
</P>
<P>
Under the Schengen agreement in effect in the 15-country
European Union (EU), all border controls had been eliminated
between 10 of the 15 EU members.
</P>
<P>
However, it has been easier for illegal immigrants to take
advantage of the EU's integration policy to move around the
Schengen zone once they enter one of the 10 countries: Belgium,
France, the Netherlands, Germany, Greece, Luxembourg, Portugal,
Austria, Italy and Spain.
</P>
<P>
The European Commission, the EU's executive body, said Belgium
had notified it of a three-week suspension of the Schengen accord
for amnesty, but the Belgian government wanted to extend the
border control indefinitely to prevent criminal gangs from taking
advantage of the amnesty aimed at non-Belgian residents with
legitimate grounds for seeking asylum.
</P>
<P>
The EU executive spokesman, Leonello Gabrici, said Belgium's
move did not breach the Schengen pact, which allows passport-free
travel within participating EU states while at the same time
tightening checks at the special zone's external borders.
</P>
<P>
Currently, Britain and Ireland still refuse to join the
Schengen agreement while Denmark, Sweden and Finland are in the
process of participating.

UNITED NATIONS, January 10 (Xinhua) -- U.N. Secretary-General
Kofi Annan will consult with the Security Council members on the
names of candidates for the chief of the new U.N. weapon
inspection regime for Iraq, U.N. spokesman Eckhard said on Monday.
</P>
<P>
The spokesman said there are more than two names on the list
and the Secretary-General is expected to announce the appointment
of the Chairman of the United Nations Monitoring, Inspection and
Verification Commission (UNMOVIC) on Friday.
</P>
<P>
Because the issue is unresolved, it remained difficult to say
how the announcement will be made on Friday, Eckhard added.
</P>
<P>
The United Nations Security Council adopted a resolution last
month which created the new U.N. weapons inspection regime for
Iraq called UNMOVIC. It replaces the United Nations Special
Commission(UNSCOM) in charge of dismantling Iraq's weapons of mass
destruction.
</P>
<P>
UNSCOM withdrew from Iraq days before the U.S.-led military
strikes against Iraq in December 1998. It has not returned to
resume its normal work since then. Iraq has barred it from
returning.

<HEADLINE> Iranian Foreign Minister Meets British Counterpart </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, January 10 (Xinhua) -- Iran's Foreign Minister Kamal
Kharrazi Monday afternoon met British Foreign Secretary Robin Cook.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at the start of the meeting, Kharrazi, the first
Iranian minister to visit Britain since the 1979 Islamic
Revolution, said he would discuss with Cook issues concerning the
two counties' interests.
</P>
<P>
The two ministers were due to agree to a memorandum of
understanding on cooperation to combat drug trafficking.
</P>
<P>
The arrival of Kharrazi in London followed the main
breakthrough in relations between Iran and Britain 18 months ago
when the two countries agreed to differ over the affair of British
writer Salman Rushdie and to put it behind them.
</P>
<P>
After late Iranian leader Ayatollah Khomeini issued a death
warrant for the British author of "The Satanic Verses" in 1989,
the relations between Britain and Iran have turned sour and come
to a standstill.
</P>
<P>
In late 1998, the Iranian government stated that it has no
intention to do anything to carry the warning out. And the two
countries have recently upgraded their relations to full
ambassadorial level.
</P>
<P>
However, British officials said British-Iranian relations will
always be sensitive for historical and other reasons.
</P>
<P>
Earlier Monday, Kharrazi held talks with British Prime Minister
Tony Blair. Their meeting mainly concentrated on the Middle East
peace process, drugs and weapons of mass destruction.

<HEADLINE> Hong Kong, Singapore Rated Freest Economies Worldwide </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, January 10 (Xinhua) -- Hong Kong and Singapore are
the most economically free jurisdictions in the world, according
to a new study released concurrently Monday in Washington and in
Hong Kong.
</P>
<P>
The study, Economic Freedom of the World: 2000 Annual Report,
published by the Washington-based Cato Institute and Canada's
Fraser Institute, in conjunction with institutes from 53 other
countries, ranks 123 economies on their level of economic freedom.
</P>
<P>
Hong Kong and Singapore currently share top position as the
freest jurisdictions in the world followed by New Zealand (3), the
United States (4), and Britain (5). Other countries ranking near
the top of the list include Ireland, Canada, Australia, the
Netherlands, Luxembourg, and Switzerland.
</P>
<P>
The least free economies include Myanmar (123), the Democratic
Republic of Congo (122), Sierra Leone (121), Rwanda (120),
Madagascar (119), and Guinea-Bissau (118).
</P>
<P>
The study shows a clear relationship between freedom and
prosperity. Countries that score in the top quintile of economic
freedom have a much higher gross domestic product (GDP) and growth
rate. Also, life expectancy in the top quintile is 20 years longer
than that found in the bottom quintile.
</P>
<P>
"This publication is important to developed and developing
countries alike because it shows the critical role that economic
freedom plays in achieving and maintaining prosperity," said Ian
Vasquez, director of the Project on Global Economic Liberty at the
Cato Institute.

<HEADLINE> Britain Hit by Worst Flu for Decade </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, January 10 (Xinhua) -- British Health Secretary Alan
Milburn said Monday that the current flu crisis could become the
most serious in 10 years.
</P>
<P>
Figures announced by Milburn showed cases of flu continuing to
rise steeply, and in some areas, patients had been sent to private
hospitals for treatment.
</P>
<P>
National Health Service (NHS) hospitals in England, Scotland,
Wales and Northern Ireland have already been stretched to the
limit by large numbers of seriously-ill patients, and the
situation was not expected to ease quickly.
</P>
<P>
Milburn said that although the outbreak was not expected to
match Britain's last epidemic, in 1989 and 1990, it could still be
the most serious since then.
</P>
<P>
Earlier government claims that flu had reached epidemic level
were strongly criticized.
</P>
<P>
The government's Chief Medical Officer Professor Lima Donaldson
said at the weekend that the health service had been confronted
with a "serious epidemic."
</P>
<P>
The Conservative Party said this is a "convenient excuse" for
the failure of the NHS to cope with a normal seasonal surge in flu
levels due to underlying problems such as shortages of beds and
nurses.
</P>
<P>
The last official figures released by the flu monitoring
service put the number of cases per 100,000 people at 144 although
the interim results for the most recent week are thought to have
increased this to approximately 200.
</P>
<P>
The official threshold for an epidemic in England, Wales and
Northern Ireland is 400 cases per 100,000.
</P>
<P>
The last declared epidemic, in 1989/90, saw a peak of 534 cases
per 100,000, and saw 29,000 flu-related deaths were reported.

<P>
ABUJA, January 10 (Xinhua) -- Chinese Foreign Minister Tang
Jiaxuan arrived here Monday evening on a three-day official visit
to Nigeria at the invitation of Foreign Minister Alhaji Sule
Lamido.
</P>
<P>
Tang was greeted at the Nnamdi Azikwe International Airport by
Nigerian Minister of State for Foreign Affairs Duben Anyiam and
other government officials.
</P>
<P>
Also greeting the 10-member delegation at the airport were
Chinese Ambassador to Nigeria Liang Yingchu and other officials
of the Chinese Embassy in Nigeria.
</P>
<P>
In a written statement distributed upon his arrival, Tang said
that Nigeria, which has a large population endowed with rich
natural resources, is a country of influence in Africa and plays
an important role in both regional and international affairs.
</P>
<P>
Over the years, the Chinese minister said, China and Nigeria
have conducted fruitful cooperation in the political, economic,
trade, cultural, educational and other fields.
</P>
<P>
The two countries have developed profound friendship through
supporting and assisting each other constantly and closely in
international affairs, he said.
</P>
<P>
Tang said that the Chinese government and people are ready to
work with Nigeria to upgrade the existing friendship and
cooperation between the two countries to a new level.
</P>
<P>
Nigeria is the first leg of the minister's five-nation African
tour, which will last till January 20.
</P>
<P>
Tang's current tour will also take him to Namibia, Zimbabwe,
Mozambique and Seychelles.
</P>
<P>
During his stay in Nigeria, the minister is scheduled to meet
President Olusegun Obasanjo and Vice President Atiku Abubakar and
other government officials.
</P>
<P>
Before his departure from Beijing, a statement issued by the
Chinese Foreign Ministry said that "Tang's visit to Africa at the
dawn of the new century and the new millennium indicate, once
again, that the Chinese government attaches great importance to
Sino-African relations as well as its solidarity and cooperation
with developing countries."
</P>
<P>
The visit would undoubtedly further promote the development of
Sino- African friendly relations characterized by long-term
stability and all-
round cooperation toward the 21st century, the statement said.

<HEADLINE> S. Africa's Population to Reach 44.7 Million </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, January 10 (Xinhua) -- South Africa's population
is estimated to reach 44.7 million this year, the Bureau of Market
Research at the University of South Africa said in a research
report published on Monday.
</P>
<P>
Of the population, 77.4 percent will be black, 11.7 percent
white, 8.4 percent coloured and 2.5 percent Asian.
</P>
<P>
Earlier projections indicated a population figure of about 80
million by 2021, but factors such as declining fertility levels
and life expectancies due to AIDS put that figure closer to 50
million, the report said.
</P>
<P>
The life expectancy for black people is expected to decrease
from the projected 57.6 years in 2001 to 50.1 years at the end of
2021, and that of coloured people from 61.8 to 61.6 years.
</P>
<P>
The life expectancy of Asians is expected to increase from 66.8
to 69 years and that of white people from 72.3 to 73.1 years.
</P>
<P>
The age distribution of the population is also expected to
change significantly. As a result, children under 10 years
constituted about 23.5 percent of the population in 1996, a
projected 17.2 percent would be in that age group in 2021.
</P>
<P>
The number of pensioners -- people aged 60 and older -- would
increase from 6.4 percent of the total population in 1996 to 10.8
percent in 2021, the report said.

wants to challenge that, the appropriate thing to do is to
challenge it in a legal way."
</P>
<P>
"Anybody's free to express their opinion about this and whether
they think they did right or wrong," Clinton said.
</P>
<P>
Following the INS decision, Clinton and Attorney General Janet
Reno endorsed the ruling of the INS to return the Cuban boy by
January 14.
</P>
<P>
Clinton repeatedly stressed that the case should be kept out of
any political process.
</P>
<P>
However, Gore, who is campaigning for the Democratic
presidential nomination, said the case should be appealed to U.S.
courts.
</P>
<P>
"It's not clear to me that they (INS officials) have the
experience and expertise to really address a question like that,"
Gore said.
</P>
<P>
"Due process ... requires that a question like this be
adjudicated by those who have the body of law that applies and the
experience in such cases," Gore added.
</P>
<P>
But Clinton affirmed that the INS has made a right decision
based on the law and regulations.
</P>
<P>
"What I tried to -- what I have successfully done, I think, is
to make sure we got through the decision without it becoming
overly politicized... I think they (INS officials) did that to the
best of their ability.

<HEADLINE> U.S., India Reach Trade Agreement </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>

<P>
WASHINGTON, January 10 (Xinhua) -- India has agreed to
eliminate barriers in agriculture, textiles and other key sectors
so that U.S. producers could enter the huge market, the Clinton
administration said Monday.
</P>
<P>
U.S. Trade Representative Charlene Barshefsky said India would
lift more than 1,400 specific import restrictions in accordance
with an agreement, signed last week with Deputy U.S. Trade
Representative Susan Esserman. Half of the restrictions will be
lifted within three months; the rest will be lifted by April 1,
2001.
</P>
<P>
"Eliminating these restrictions will provide -- for the first
time in 50 years for some products -- market access opportunities
for U.S. producers in key sectors such as textiles, agriculture,
consumer goods and a wide variety of manufactured products, and at
the same time will stimulate investment, competition, and economic
activity in India," Barshefsky said in a statement.
</P>
<P>
India agreed to lift these import bans and licensing
requirements following a World Trade Organization (WTO) ruling in
August 1999, which found New Delhi in violation of its market-
access obligations as a WTO member.
</P>
<P>
India has reached similar agreements with the European Union,
Japan and other countries to remove these barriers by April 2003.

<HEADLINE> Italian, Japanese FM Discuss U.N. Reform </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ROME, January 10 (Xinhua) -- Italian Foreign Minister Lamberto
Dini and his Japanese counterpart, Yohei Kono discussed here
Monday issues on United Nations' reform.
</P>
<P>
A statement from the Italian foreign ministry, where the two
diplomatic chiefs met, said that Dini illustrated "Italy's
position on the reform of the UN Security Council which is not
designed to be opposed to Japan's legitimate aspirations" for a
seat on the Council.
</P>
<P>
The statement added that "what are unacceptable are solutions
that penalize Italian interests. What must be sought is a solution
that makes the Council more representative and more democratic
through its enlargement, which should include a seat for the
European Union."
</P>
<P>
Japanese Foreign Minister Kono, who arrived Rome last Saturday,
was said to have "recognized Italy's important role" within the UN
and, in particular, voiced his government's "appreciation" for the
participation of an Italian contingent in the UN peace force
deployed in East Timor.
</P>
<P>
Japan and Italy respectively hold and will next hold the
rotating presidency of the G8, the Group of Seven most
industrialized countries plus Russia.
</P>
<P>
Thus Monday's talks also allowed for an examination of the
agenda for the next G8 summit as well as attempts to revive the
stalled process to reform the World Trade Organization, after the
failed summit in Seattle last year.
</P>
<P>
On bilateral issues, Dini and Kono stressed the "need to give a
boost to the flow of two-way direct investments, also to strike a
new balance in relations that are currently lopsided towards trade.
"
</P>
<P>
They also examined the prospects for developing bilateral
relations in a variety of areas, especially in the framework of
the important initiatives slated to be part of the 2001 Italy in
Japan event.

<HEADLINE> 65th Berlin Int'l "Green Week" to Be Held </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>

<P>
BERLIN, January 10 (Xinhua) -- The 65th Berlin International
Agricultural Fair, "Green Week," will be held on January 14 to 23.
</P>
<P>
Companies from 60 countries and more than 1600 exhibitors are
expected to attend the fair. It is the biggest one in its history,
said Axel Thimm of the Berlin fair company.
</P>
<P>
The "Green Week" is the largest food, agriculture and
gardening show that the food industry regards as testing grounds
for its new products.
</P>
<P>
For visitors the "Green Week" perhaps provides a good tasting
place for various foods. They can come with empty stomach and
taste every kind of food as much as possible.
</P>
<P>
During the "Green Week" more than 250 symposia will be held. "
In view of the global markets, Green Week has gained greatly in
importance," the German Farmers Federation DBV said. The fair
offers unique chances for international contacts.
</P>
<P>
Many German states will use this fair for showing their own
products and their own images, for example, Brandenburg, an
eastern state, where Berlin is located, will present 30 new
products.
</P>
<P>
 The "Green Week" started from a general farming fair in 1926
and developed into a increasingly specialized fair during which a
large number of symposia were arranged. For instance, the "Fruit
Logistica" special symposium has become the leading fair for the
worldwide fruit trade.

<HEADLINE> Y2K Scare Not Completely Over </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>

<P>
OTTAWA, January 10 (Xinhua) -- The Y2K scare is not completely
over as the world has entered a leap year with another hurdle to
appear on February 29, Canadian media reports warned Monday.
</P>
<P>
"There are two tests. One was the rollover on January 1 and
the other is coming up on February 29 to see if the Leap Year
works. If people didn't code correctly, Feb. 29 could cause
problems," the Ottawa-based IT/net Consulting Inc. was quoted as
saying.
</P>
<P>
Many Canadian companies will be continuing to monitor their
systems until March 1, according to the local media.
</P>
<P>
As some computers may not expect a leap day this year, they
may skip ahead to March 1. But the major disasters some were
predicting have been avoided, the media said.
</P>
<P>
So far, there have been no reports of major Y2K problems in
the country. This is not to say that there won't be any minor
glitches in the weeks to come, the media noted.

<HEADLINE> Gadhafi's Visit To Brussels Still Needs Approval </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BRUSSELS, January 10 (Xinhua) -- The European Commission said
Monday that the possible visit of the Libyan President, Moammar
Gadhafi, to Brussels still needs to be approved by all members of
the 15-nation European Union (EU).
</P>
<P>
The EU executive's spokesman, Gunnar Wiegande, said any such
visit has to be approved by the EU member states. He said EU
foreign ministers will meet on this topic in Brussels next Tuesday
as part of the Euro-Mediterranean Barcelona process.
</P>
<P>
Wiegande also said that EU foreign relation commissioner Chris
Patten has consulted this matter with European Commission
President Romano Prodi and he expressed his political desire to
make contacts with the Libyan leader.
</P>
<P>
A spokesman for the Libyan leader said last Thursday that the
idea of a visit to Brussels was mentioned in a telephone
conversation between Prodi and Gadhafi. The call was made by the
Libyan leader to coincide with the Christmas festivities.
</P>
<P>
However, the European Commission is not yet prepared to admit
sending an official invitation to the Libyan leader. But it sent a
telegram last Thursday to current EU presidency Portugal and the
other 14 EU member states urging them to contemplate an official
invitation through the normal diplomatic channels.
</P>
<P>
According to the EU executive branch, the EU's approval cannot
yet be taken as ready as the resumption of diplomatic contacts
with Libya. It is conditional on Gadhafi's acceptance in writing
of the criteria and legislative achievements of the Barcelona
process.
</P>
<P>
Portuguese Foreign Minister Jaime Gama said last week that the
initiative of Gadhafi's visit may be attributed to "the special
relationship between Libya and Italy." "The Italians are the main
ones sensitive to this issue," the minister added.
</P>
<P>
Libya is Italy's biggest oil supplier and Italy accounts for
the bulk of exports to its former colony.
</P>
<P>
EU-Libya relations have improved significantly since Tripoli's
acceptance last year of the call to extradite for trial in the
Netherlands two Libyans suspected of involvement in the Lockerbie
air disaster over Scotland in December 1988.

<HEADLINE> IMF Says Ready to Help Ecuador on Dollarization </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, January 10 (Xinhua) -- The International Monetary
Fund (IMF) said on Monday it was ready to provide technical
assistance as Ecuador adapts its fiscal and banking systems to
cope with government plans to introduce the U.S. dollar.
</P>
<P>
A brief statement by IMF Managing Director Michel Camdessus
also said the IMF was ready to send a "fact-finding mission" to
the South American country.
</P>
<P>
"In light of the announcement yesterday by the government of
Ecuador of its intention to move the economy to full dollarization,
the IMF is prepared to send a fact-finding mission to Quito to
provide technical assistance in adapting their fiscal and banking
strategies to dollarization," Camdessus said.
</P>
<P>
"Once suitable measures are identified, IMF management looks
forward to working with the authorities to support their economic
program," he added.
</P>
<P>
Ecuadorean President Jamil Mahuad said on Sunday that
dollarization, which would effectively scrap the currency and
bring in the U.S. dollar, was Ecuador's best way out of its
economic chaos. Ministers said the move would slash inflation and
help Ecuador stabilize its recession-hit economy.
</P>
<P>
The IMF has been negotiating with Ecuador for months in an
effort to finalize agreement on an economic program that could be
underpinned by an IMF loan. Finance Minister Alfredo Arizaga said
on Monday that the dollarization plan meant Ecuador no longer
needed IMF cash.

<HEADLINE> Russian General: Shali, Argun Under Federal Control </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, January 10 (Xinhua) -- A ranking Russian general said
Monday that federal troops have secured control of the Chechen
towns of Shali and Argun, which came under rebel infiltration from
Sunday.
</P>
<P>
Colonel-General Viktor Kazantsev, commander of federal forces
in the North Caucasus, told the ORT public television that up to
150 rebels were killed and some 100 wounded in the fighting.
</P>
<P>
He said the rebels' action in Shali and Argun were planned in
advance to distract federal troops from Grozny, the Chechen
capital.
</P>
<P>
"They did not achieve it and sustained losses," Kazantsev said.
</P>
<P>
He said his troops now control not only the plains but also
most of the mountains of the breakaway republic and that the
entire territory of Chechnya will soon come under federal control.
</P>
<P>
However, he said "there is no rigid deadline" for the campaign,
which was launched last September following armed Chechen
incursions into neighboring Daghestan and a series of terrorist
bombings, also blamed on Chechen militants who killed over 300
people in three Russian cities.
</P>
<P>
"We act according to the situation, plan independent actions by
sector, and this has yielded results -- minimal losses among our
troops and peaceful citizens and maximum losses among militants,"
Kazantsev said.
</P>
<P>
He also accused the rebels of staging an information war.
Reports that they had "seized Gudermes and will take Achkhoi-
Martan and Urus-Martan," three other towns in Chechnya, were
groundless, he said.
</P>
<P>
Kazantsev said the Defense Ministry lost one serviceman in
Shali and three were wounded. Two interior troops were killed and
three wounded there.
</P>
<P>
He acknowledged heavier federal casualties in Argun, where a
column of interior troops were ambushed, with 10 killed and 15
wounded.
</P>
<P>
Earlier Monday, Russian Acting President Vladimir Putin
condemned the rebels for staging attacks following the federal
troops' suspension of hostilities for the days marking the end of
Ramadan, the holy Muslim month of fasting.
</P>
<P>
What the rebels did thereafter, however, demonstrated once
again that they "are people without clan or tribe or faith, (they
are) simply bandits," the Interfax news agency quoted Putin as
saying.
</P>
<P>
He said the rebels were trying to destroy evidence of their
involvement in the terrorist blasts last summer in the Russian
cities.
</P>
<P>
"It has become completely evident to us that all the terrorist
acts, in particular the bombings in Moscow, Volgodonsk and
Buinaksk, were prepared in Urus-Martan, on territory controlled by
Chechen fighters," Putin said.
</P>
<P>
The latest rebel action was an attempt to "evade responsibility,
" he said.

<HEADLINE> Clinton Launches All-out Effort For China's Entry Into WTO </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, January 10 (Xinhua) -- U.S. President Bill Clinton
launched an "all-out effort" Monday to push the Congress to
facilitate China's accession to the World Trade Organization (WTO).
</P>
<P>
At a press conference at the White House, Clinton announced
that a team consisting of his international economic cabinet
members and his Policy Council coordinators will launch the "all-
out effort". The team will be led by Commerce Secretary William
Daley and White House deputy chief of staff Steve Ricchetti.
</P>
<P>
Delay led the White House war room in 1993 in the
administration's successful drive to win approval of the North
American Free Trade Agreement with Canada and Mexico.
</P>
<P>
"This year we face major challenges and opportunities in our
relationship with China in foreign and security policy, economic
policy, and trade," Clinton said.
</P>
<P>
"All those issues come together in one opportunity for the
American people -- what we stand to gain when China enters the
World Trade Organization," he said. "But to lock in our benefits,
we first must grant China permanent normal trade relations status.
"
</P>
<P>
Clinton said the U.S.-China agreement on China's entry into WTO
reached at the end of last year was "a good deal for America" as
American products will gain better access to China's market in
every sector, from agriculture to telecommunications to
automobiles.
</P>
<P>
"Bringing China into the WTO is a win-win decision," he said. "
I will be working hard over the coming weeks and over the coming
months to make sure we do not let this opportunity slip away."
</P>
<P>
The White House will concentrate on rounding up Republican
votes to admit China to the WTO this year, White House officials
said.
</P>
<P>
Clinton is expected to meet with his full cabinet on January 19
to discuss ways and means to win the Republican support on the
issue.

<HEADLINE> Expert: Growth in Economic Inequality Between Nations Ceased </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, January 10 (Xinhua) -- Between 1960 and 1989, the
pace of economic inequality between rich and poor nations slowed
to a halt, largely due to the economic resurgence of China, a
researcher of the Pennsylvania State University said.
</P>
<P>
"During the 1960s, 1970s and 1980s, the rich nations did in
fact get richer, but not at a faster rate than the poor nations
got richer," said Dr. Glenn Firebaugh, professor of sociology, in
a news release received here Monday.
</P>

"This observation does not mean that all poor nations are
keeping up," he said. "Many small poor nations are slipping
further behind -- yet, because of China, the average income in
poor nations grew just as fast as the average income in rich
nations."
</P>
<P>
"One important implication for U.S. business is that, when
China is included, the overall market in poor nations is expanding
faster than it is in rich nations, since population is growing
much faster in poor nations than in rich nations while per capita
incomes are growing at a similar pace overall for both groups," he
added.

Economic inequality between countries has to do with ratios,
rather than gaps expressed in absolute numbers, according to
Firebaugh. In terms of absolute wealth, the gap between rich and
poor nations continued to widen between 1960 and 1989, but the
income increase in percentages was about the same for rich and
poor nations.
</P>
<P>
Firebaugh also stressed that no study of income between rich
and poor nations could be accurate without considering the vast
size of China, which has 20 percent of the world's people.
</P>
<P>
"Significant economic growth of China between 1960 and 1989 was
a key factor in reducing income inequality between rich and poor
nations," he said.
</P>
<P>
Firebaugh's research period ended with the watershed year of
1989, marked by the sudden disintegration of the Soviet Union.
This resulted in a somewhat different configuration of nations, as
the various Soviet republics emerged as independent nations after
1989.
