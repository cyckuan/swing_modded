<HEADLINE> Barak Asks Desney Not to Bow to Arab Pressure </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, September 17 (Xinhua) -- Israeli Prime Minister Ehud
Barak has asked the Walt Desney World not to yield to Arab
pressure regarding Israel's participation in Desney's millennium
celebrations at Epcot Park in Florida.
</P>
<P>
In a statement issued Friday, Barak blasted the Arabs for their
efforts to stop an Israeli pavilion from opening at the park.
</P>
<P>
It was reported that Israel has planned to stage an exhibit
emphasizing Jerusalem inside its pavilion.
</P>
<P>
The Arab delegations to the celebrations strongly oppose the
exhibit, arguing that it bears political impact by designating
Jerusalem as Israel's capital.
</P>
<P>
Members of the Arab delegations, which included ambassadors
from Morocco and the United Arab Emirates, presented on Wednesday
Walt Desney World's President Al Weiss with a memo outlining their
objections to the exhibit. They also asked Desney to remove the
exhibit from the pavilion, otherwise, the Arab nations would
boycott the celebration.
</P>
<P>
Weiss planned to talk to Arab leaders again on Friday to
head off the controversy over Israel's exhibit.
</P>
<P>
"Efforts to harm Israel's standing on Jerusalem as its capital
failed in the past and would fail in the future," Barak said in
his statement, adding that Israel does not expect Desney to yield
to such pressures.
</P>
<P>
Israeli Foreign Ministry sent a letter to Disney Chairman
Michael Eisner Wednesday, which expressed Israel's confidence
that the exhibit will be presented in its entirety.
</P>
<P>
With the participation of about 35 countries, the 15-month
Desney celebrations are scheduled to open on October 1.

<HEADLINE> Jobs, Crime, Italians' Prime Concerns, Surveys Says </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ROME, September 17 (Xinhua) -- A scarcity of jobs and a rise in
crime proved to be by far the most pressing of Italians' worries
in the latest six-monthly survey of national thinking carried out
by the Italian National Council for the Economy and Employment
(CNEL).
</P>
<P>
Of those polled, 48 percent said creating jobs was the prime
concern though over 50 percent of those interviewed in some
southern areas cited joblessness as the nation's biggest problem.
</P>
<P>
The number of those prepared to approach the problem by making
the labor market more flexible rather than via state intervention
rose by 2 percent.
</P>
<P>
Those ready to back flexible, lower-paid and less guaranteed
contracts rose to 45 percent, compared to 39 percent against.
</P>
<P>
A close second in the national rankings of bugbears was crime,
with 20 percent of the 4,500 interviewed putting it in top slot, a
rise of 3 percent on the previous survey.
</P>
<P>
In the field of politics, the number of those polled in favor
of neo-liberal free-market solutions was up 3-5 percent in the
last two years, to 30 percent.
</P>
<P>
Those holding to what the survey called "conservative"
positions was steady at around 53 percent.
</P>
<P>
On ways to fight crime, the CNEL found that the Italians are
about evenly divided between those asking for stiffer sentences,
47 percent, and others who say that trials must be swift and
efficient.

<HEADLINE> At Least 27 Killed in Fighting in S. Somalia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOGADISHU, September 17 (Xinhua) -- At least 27 people were
killed and a dozen wounded in fierce fightings Friday morning in
southern Somalia between the Ethiopian backed breakaway faction of
the Somali National Front (SNF) and the SNF main stream.
</P>
<P>
According to independent sources from Garbaharrey town, the
SNF main stream, led by Omar Hajji Masalleh, launched the attack
in the early morning for the control of the regional capital,
Garbaharrey, in the border Gedo region and targeted the defectors'
positions.
</P>
<P>
Eyewitnesses contacted on the VHF radios said the SNF main
stream forces, which had been chased out of the town four days
ago, were equipped with heavy portable machine guns,
rocket-propelled grenades and assault rifles, while the breakaway
faction resorted to five battle wagons.
</P>
<P>
The defeated breakaway forces are reported to have fled to Luq
town where Ethiopian forces are in control since the beginning of
this year. According to eyewitnesses, no Ethiopian forces were
involved in the fighting.
</P>
<P>
There has been no word as yet from the side of the breakaway
SNF faction, which has been in close relation with the Ethiopian
forces. However, there are reports indicating that Buraleh's
forces are now regrouping for counter- attack.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the combined forces of the Rahanwein Resistance Army
(RRA) and the Digil Salvation Army (DSA) on one side and those of
Hussein Mohamed Aidid on the other went into clashes outside the
town of Qoryoley, about 120 kilometers south of Mogadishu.
</P>
<P>
According to sources from the region, more than nine people
were killed and at least 15 others wounded as the RRA and DSA
forces tried to take the town from the hand of Aidid's forces, who
since the beginning of this month have been digging defensive
trenches.
</P>
<P>
However, none of the two sides has gained any territories in
the fighting.

<HEADLINE> GA President Urges Equitable Representation, Gender </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, September 17 (Xinhua) -- The principle of
equitable geographical representation and gender balance must be
respected, particularly in the appointment of staff to senior
level positions, President of the General Assembly Theo-Ben
Gurirab stressed here Friday.
</P>
<P>
Speaking on the occasion of the United Nations Staff Day,
September 17, Gurirab said U.N. staff represents a microcosm of
the peoples of the world and more senior staff from developing
countries should be appointed to these senior positions.
</P>
<P>
On the challenges facing the United Nations, Gurirab said they
include but are not limited to issues as important as career
development, staff mobility, the safety and security of
humanitarian staff and protection of United Nations personnel as
well as human resources management in general.
</P>
<P>
On the threshold of the next century, the United Nations is
faced with momentous tasks, including issues such as its reform,
globalization, gender equality, sustainable development and
protection of the environment, regional conflict and the resulting
refugee crises, HIV-AIDS pandemic and the plight of children, he
said.
</P>
<P>
Addressing these issues requires foresight and dedication on
the part of Member States, and it also requires a cadre of
motivated staff, responding to the Charter requirements of
efficiency, competence and integrity, Gurirab said.

<HEADLINE> UK Gov't Admits Acting Illegally on GM Crop </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, September 17 (Xinhua) -- Britain's green campaigners
scored a victory over genetically-modified (GM) crops Friday when
the British government admitted that it acted illegally in
allowing trials of GM crops to go ahead.
</P>
<P>
Earlier in August, Friends of the Earth (FoE) presented papers
to the High Court in London, calling for a judicial review of the
British government's licensing of crop trials.
</P>
<P>
The environmental pressure group claimed that the government
was wrong to allow agrochemical firm AgrEvo UK to switch one of
its tests of GM rapeseed from spring to autumn planting without
submitting a new application to an advisory committee monitoring
the crops.
</P>
<P>
Speaking Friday at a news conference, Michael Meacher,
Britain's environment minister, said the government has decided
not to contest FoE's challenge to the legality of the tests.
</P>
<P>
"Following legal advice, the government has decided not to
contest the judicial review of proceedings instigated by Friends
of the Earth in respect of licensing of certain GM trials," said
Meacher.
</P>
<P>
"We are accepting that on this point we acted illegally," he
said, adding that the decision not to contest the judicial review
won by FoE was made on technical grounds and was not based on
fears over the crop's safety.
</P>
<P>
Meacher said that the British government's program of
farm-scale GM crop trials will continue.

<P>
HARARE, September 17 (Xinhua) -- Zimbabwe accused Friday the
Rebels in the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC) for
"systematically violating" the cease-fire agreement to provoke the
allied forces.
</P>
<P>
Zimbabwean Defense Ministry charged the rebels for looting
foodstuffs and domestic animals and abducting and killing
civilians.
</P>
<P>
The ministry spokesman Chancellor Diye said in a statement that
the rebels have killed several civilians in Kasai province last
week and shot at routine ration re-supply aircraft.
</P>
<P>
"The systematic attacks are probably meant to force the allied
forces to react so that they can claim that the allied forces have
breached the cease- fire and hence resume their military
offensives to gain more territory," he said.
</P>
<P>
Zimbabwe, Angola, Chad and Namibia have been fighting alongside
DRC President Laurent Kabila's soldiers to crash Rwandese and
Ugandan backed rebellions.

<HEADLINE> U.N. Condemns Fatal Attack Against Aid Worker in Sudan </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, September 17 (Xinhua) -- The death of an aid
worker from the U.N. Children's Fund (UNICEF), who was fatally
wounded in an ambush Wednesday during a campaign to vaccinate
children against polio, drew strong reactions from the UNICEF and
a top U.N. official for humanitarian affairs.
</P>
<P>
In a statement issued Thursday in New York, the UNICEF lamented
with profound regret and sorrow in the passing away of Ayub Sheikh
Yerow who died Thursday morning from a gun shot wound in a North
Mogadishu hospital.
</P>
<P>
Ayub was wounded on the evening of September 15 while traveling
by road on a planning assignment for the October National
Immunization Day to vaccinate approximately 1 million children in
Somalia.
</P>
<P>
"Dr. Ayub's death adds one more to a growing list of casualties
involving humanitarian workers courageously seeking to carry out
life-saving missions in extremely dangerous situations," the
UNICEF said, stressing that such attacks were a completely
unacceptable violation of international law and fundamental human
rights.
</P>
<P>
Echoing this statement, U.N. Under-Secretary-General for
Humanitarian Affairs Sergio Vieira de Mello said in a statement
that the attack served as "a grim reminder" of the impunity with
which lives are taken in conflict areas around the world.
</P>
<P>
"I trust that local authorities will take immediate measures
to apprehend those responsible and ensure that the safety of
humanitarian workers is guaranteed," de Mello said.

<HEADLINE> First Premature Baby Saved in UK Operation </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, September 17 (Xinhua) -- Surgeons have made British
medical history by operating on a baby while he was still in his
mother's womb, BBC reported Friday.
</P>
<P>
Baby Jaydon, now 13 days old, was the first premature baby in
Britain to receive a life-saving windpipe operation while he was
still halfway inside his mother's womb.
</P>
<P>
The operation, which took place at Newcastle-upon-Tyne's Royal
Victoria Infirmary in September, involved keeping the baby in
suspended labor while doctors unblocked his windpipe.
</P>
<P>
The baby's mother, Joanne Vasey, aged 17, went into labor when
she was only 32 weeks pregnant. Pre-natal scans suggested a
windpipe blockage, which meant the baby would suffocate as soon as
his umbilical cord was cut.
</P>
<P>
The only solution was to open the mother's abdomen and keep him
in pre-birth limbo so that he can still receive oxygen through the
umbilical cord.
</P>
<P>
A 20-strong medical team battled to correct the problem and the
45-minute operation was a success.
</P>
<P>
Similar operations have been carried out in the United States
before, but this is the first time it has been performed in
Britain.

<HEADLINE> UK Researcher Creates Novel Data Storage Technique </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, September 17 (Xinhua) -- A British professor has
developed a new data storage technology which promises to enable
palmtop PCs to carry as much data as a mainframe computer.
</P>
<P>
The technique is so efficient that "2,300 gigabytes of data can
be squeezed on to a device the size of a credit card," Financial
Times said Friday.
</P>
<P>
The technology, created by Ted Williams, emeritus professor of
electronic engineering in Britain's Keele University, relies on a
new family of metal alloys which allow huge amounts of information
to be stored inside the material.
</P>
<P>
It then operates in conjunction with a new optical method of
accessing the information on multiple levels inside the material
using sophisticated software.
</P>
<P>
The system, which has no moving parts, is said to be far more
reliable than existing PC hard disks. As it uses much current
hardware technology, the devices can also be quickly put into
production after a short development period.
</P>
<P>
"The technology is scaleable, either up or down, so that even
wristwatches will be capable of handling a memory capacity of more
than 100 gigabytes," professor Ted Williams was quoted as saying.

<HEADLINE> Final Status Talks Highly Delicate, PLC Says </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
RAMALLAH, September 17 (Xinhua) -- The final status talks
between the Palestinians and Israel are highly delicate and
sensitive, said Chief of the Palestinian Legislative Council Ahmed
Qureia (Abu-Alaa) Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Abu-Alaa made the remarks in his opening address to the
Palestinian Expert Conference on Final Settlement in Ramallah, the
West Bank.
</P>
<P>
The interim stage was the outcome of a political rally on the
Arab, regional and international arenas under the new
international situation following the second Gulf War, he said,
stressing that the peace process in the Middle East can not
succeed without the rules and provisions of the U.N. resolutions.
</P>
<P>
Abu-Alaa summed up the targets of the Palestinian people as the
termination of the three-decade Israeli occupation, the removal of
all Jewish settlements, the return of all Palestinians in exile,
and the founding of an independent Palestinian state with
Jerusalem as its capital as well as integration with the Arab
nation.
</P>
<P>
He underlined the importance of complete separation between the
interim stage and the final status talks, and halting the
settlement activity.
</P>
<P>
Organized by the International Organization for Dialog and
Democracy, the three-day conference is chaired by Hanan Ashrawi,
member of the the PLC and deals with issues of the final status
talks.

<HEADLINE> Cyprus' Defense Minister Visits Greece </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NICOSIA, September 17 (Xinhua) -- Cyprus Defense Minister
Socrates Hasikos left here Friday for an official visit to Greece
for talks with his Greek counterpart Akis Tsohatzopoulos.
</P>
<P>
Hasikos said before departure that the two sides will discuss
bilateral cooperation in defense and will review a joint defense
pact signed in November 1993.
</P>
<P>
Under the pact, Greece will provide air, sea and land coverage
to Cyprus in case of a new Turkish offensive against the island.
</P>
<P>
The minister also announced that Cyprus' annual National Guard
exercise codenamed "Nikiforos" has been brought forward to
October 2 to 7.
</P>
<P>
He said that the military manoeuvre "will take place as it is
the only exercise our small army carries out."
</P>
<P>
Explaining why the exercise has been brought forward, he said
"President Clerides is now in New York for important meetings and
the government decided it would be better it took place before any
talks."
</P>
<P>
Clerides has been in the U.S. since Thursday to address the
U.N. General Assembly and he will hold talks with
U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan and other key players in efforts
to settle the Cyprus issue.
</P>
<P>
A new effort is now underway for peace talks to be resumed at
the end of October and Annan is expected to extend invitations to
the Greek Cypriot and Turkish Cypriot sides to attend the talks.
</P>
<P>
Cyprus has been divided into the Turkish Cypriots-controlled
north and the Greek Cypriots-dominated south since 1974 when
Turkish troops invaded and occupied the northern third of the
island in the wake of a failed coup seeking union with Athens.
</P>
<P>
Negotiations have not been held for the past two years, due to
preconditions set by the Turkish side for recognition of the
breakaway state in northern Cyprus.
</P>
<P>
The Turkish side also demands establishment of a confederation
of two states on the island.

<HEADLINE> News Analysis: What Causes Economic Crisis in </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUANDA, September 17 (Xinhua) -- Scarcity of foreign currencies
and the fluctuation of exchange rate manipulated by speculators
are listed by the Angolan government as the main causes of the
current economic crisis distorting the war-torn country.
</P>
<P>
Angolan President Jose Eduardo dos Santos presided over an
emergent meeting of the Council of Ministers in Luanda Thursday,
at which ministers and experts also attributed the economic crisis
to the reduction of goods supply, the augmentation of public
expenditure and the existence of a large amount of counterfeit
notes.
</P>
<P>
It is true that the country has no enough foreign currencies to
fill the bottomless abyss in the exchange market, for Angola is a
country that is making a living on the mono-economy, namely on
petroleum export.
</P>
<P>
The long-term depression of the price of petroleum in the world
market since 1997 has distorted the southern African country. The
lowest price under 10 U.S. dollars per barrel early this year gave
a decisive punch to the country, which was forced to abandon its
fixed rate of exchange on July 3.
</P>
<P>
In consequence of the low petroleum price and the so-called
manipulation of the exchange market, the national currency
readjusted kwanza saw a sharp decline in its value.
</P>
<P>
At this moment, the exchange rate in readjusted kwanza against
U.S. dollar has reached seven million readjusted kwanza for one
dollar, devaluating by 900 percent in three months. On July 2,
readjusted kwanza was officially priced at 700,000 for one dollar.
</P>
<P>
It is also recognized by analysts here that the reduction of
goods supply and the existence of counterfeit notes also perturbed
the economic order. But all the reasons aforementioned are not
the fundamental cause of the economic crisis.
</P>
<P>
However, what is the fundamental cause of the economic crisis?
Local analysts pointed out that it is the civil war.
</P>
<P>
Angola is the second largest oil-producing country in
sub-Saharan Africa, and is abundant in diamond resource. For a
country with only ten million population, the rich mineral
resources mean great potential in economic development. But the
war impeded it from going ahead.
</P>
<P>
The 25-year-old civil war has destroyed most of the
infrastructures around the country, created over two million
displaced people in need for food, potable water and other
necessities, and mined a lot of the principal roads and then
prevented the government from exploring for more mineral
resources.
</P>
<P>
The impact of war on agriculture is most terrible. Due to the
rampant war all around the country, most farmers and peasants were
forced to leave their villages for cities and towns, where the
cultivated land is rare.
</P>
<P>
Since some local governments organized self-sufficient
agricultural production, the displaced people can not get the
necessary means of production such as tools and seeds.
</P>
<P>
Also due to the ambushes frequently launched by the rebel
National Union for the Total Independence of Angola (UNITA),
transportation columns encountered a lot of difficulties on their
way to the interior parts of the country as they have to cross the
rural areas controlled by the UNITA rebels led by Jonas Savimbi.
</P>
<P>
UNITA has recently changed their tactics. They drove many
rural residents into the cities and besieged them, in a bid to
force the government to pay more attention to helping the
displaced people and to scatter the strength of the government
troops.
</P>
<P>
It is very difficult for the government troops to find their
enemies, for the UNITA rebels have scattered into small groups and
hid in forests and rural areas.
</P>
<P>
But the attack on civil vehicles and small villages are
worrying the government.
</P>
<P>
So, what the displaced people can do is to wait. They have
little food, water and seeds. To them, money means nothing because
there are few goods supply due to the difficult transportation.
</P>
<P>
In big cities such as the national capital city of Luanda,
people are also living a miserable life, with the fast rising
prices of the daily necessities.
</P>
<P>
Because the country imports most of food and other necessities,
the Angolan people are suffering from the fluctuating exchange
rate of the readjusted kwanza against the U.S. dollar. But during
the period of war, production of food and those necessities is
impossible.
</P>
<P>
That is the dilemma all Angolans are facing. Most people have
expressed their eagerness for the end of war as soon as possible,
which will lighten their way to the happy life.

<HEADLINE> FSA Tells Consumers Not to Be Fobbed Off </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, September 17 (Xinhua) -- New research shows nearly one
in four people feel they have been badly treated by a financial
institution, but they often don't know how to complain and
frequently give up too easily.
</P>
<P>
In the case of young people aged 16-24, the research found no
one who pursued their complaint further. This may have something
to do with poor levels of financial education, the research says.
</P>
<P>
According to the financial regulator, the Financial Services
Authority (FSA), people should not allow themselves to be fobbed
off, but should follow up their complaints.
</P>
<P>
To help consumers, the FSA Friday launched its first guide to
making a complaint. It contains tips for effective complaints.
</P>
<P>
It shows how to write a firm but polite letter to a bank,
insurance company or other financial company, how to follow up the
complaint and who to go to if no agreement can be reached.
</P>
<P>
Christine Farnish, director of consumer relations at the
launching, said, "People are often reluctant to complain in this
country. But we shouldn't be shy, and we need to complain more
effectively."
</P>
<P>
"Remember firms also need feedback from consumers, otherwise
they won't know what's going wrong and how to put it right," he
added.

<HEADLINE> Syrian FM to Meet Albright in New York </HEADLINE>

DAMASCUS, September 17 (Xinhua) -- Syrian Foreign Minister
Farouq al-Sharaa will meet U.S. Secretary of State Madeleine
Albright in New York on the sideline of the coming session of the
U.N General Assembly, diplomatic sources said here on Friday.
</P>
<P>
Al-Sharaa will leave for New York on Saturday after a stopover
in Paris to continue his talks with Albright on the Middle East
peace process and the U.S. efforts to resume the peace talks on
the Syrian and Lebanese tracks.
</P>
<P>
Albright will also meet Israeli Foreign Minister David Levy in
New York.
</P>
<P>
U.S. Assistant Secretary of State for the Middle East Martin
Indyk and U.S. Middle East Envoy Dennis Ross will perform shuttle
diplomacy in the region to convey the viewpoints of both Israel
and Syria and to narrow the gaps between the two countries, the
sources said.
</P>
<P>
Syria insists that Israel withdraw its troops to the borders of
June 4, 1967, and recognize the principles established in the
previous talks with the former Israeli government of Rabin.
</P>
<P>
Political observers expect that intensive diplomatic activities
in the region in the coming months could lead to the resumption of
the peace talks on the Syrian and Lebanese tracks which have been
stalled for three years.

<HEADLINE> Foreign Direct Investment in Tanzania to Surpass </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, September 17 (Xinhua) -- Foreign direct
investment (FDI) in Tanzania this year is projected to reach 231.4
million U.S. dollars, compared with 181.5 million during the
1997/98 fiscal year, Tanzanian President Benjamin Mkapa said
Friday.
</P>
<P>
In a speech with a copy available here, Mkapa told the National
Press Club in Washington D.C., USA, that with the improvement of
investment environment in his country, foreign direct investments
kept pouring in.
</P>
<P>
The Tanzanian president, who is on a working visit to the
United States, attributed the increasing FDI to political
stability, correct economic and fiscal policies in the east
African country.
</P>
<P>
In addition, Mkapa said Tanzania has investment incentives that
offer a well-balanced package, especially in mining. Transfer of
capital and profits is allowed and currency is freely convertible
in Tanzania, he noted.
</P>
<P>
Moreover, he said investments in Tanzania are protected against
 arbitrary nationalization and expropriation, and the Tanzania
Investment Center is being strengthened to be a truly one-stop
center that will assist investors in all issues.
</P>
<P>
The Tanzanian president also said that there are no
restrictions in enterprise entering into technology transfer
agreements, and any foreign business operating in Tanzania may
obtain credit for domestic financial institutions up to set
limits.
</P>
<P>
Mkapa said although Tanzania does not have facilities and
efficiency as good as the United States, the country is serious in
co-operating with foreign investors.
</P>
<P>
He asked U.S. investors, tourists and traders "to take a second
 objective look at Tanzania and the opportunities it offers."
</P>
<P>
In 1997, Tanzania was the sixth largest destination for inward
direct investment in sub-Saharan Africa.
</P>
<P>
In 1994/95, foreign direct investment in Tanzania was only
104.1 million dollars.

<HEADLINE> Yugoslavia Sees KLA Disarmament as Farce </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, September 17 (Xinhua) -- Yugoslavia has said
the disarmament of the Kosovo Liberation Army (KLA) was a farce
because the rebel group was hiding its best weapons in Albania,
Macedonia and secret storage spots inside Kosovo, the Yugoslav
province.
</P>
<P>
The statement came as Vladislav Jovanovic, charge d'affaires of
the Yugoslav Mission to the United Nations, was speaking at a
press conference here.
</P>
<P>
"They surrender what is old-fashioned, vintage and not of much
importance," he said. "But what is really modern and efficient
they conceal."
</P>
<P>
"Everybody knows that," he said.
</P>
<P>
The senior Yugoslav diplomat accused NATO and the United
Nations of backing the KLA and its goal of an independent Kosovo,
and of encouraging KLA fighters to join the police, the civilian
administration of towns and villages, and a new national guard.
</P>
<P>
This has undermined a United Nations resolution and violated
the sovereignty and territorial integrity of Yugoslavia, he said.
</P>
<P>
Security Council Resolution 1244, adopted on June 10, demands
that every State Member and the world body fully respect the
sovereignty and territorial integrity of the Federal Republic of
Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
Russia insists on the complete disbanding and demilitarization
of the rebel army and sees the new force as part of international
attempts to weaken the hold on the province of its traditional
ally, Serbia, a Yugoslav republic.
</P>
<P>
Jovanovic made the statement as he introduced the second volume
of "NATO Crimes in Yugoslavia: Documentary Evidence," which
provides further information and evidence about the crimes of NATO
and its members that participated in the aggression against his
country from April 25 to June 10.
</P>
<P>
The first volume was published at the end of May 1999.
</P>
<P>
The U.S.-led NATO, without the authorization of the United
Nations Security Council, unilaterally launched 79-day air strikes
on Yugoslavia, a sovereign and independent country, thus violating
the U.N. Charter and international law.

<HEADLINE> Study Links High Blood Pressure to Osteoporosis </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, September 17 (Xinhua) -- Researchers from Britain and
the United States said Friday they have found the first proof that
women with higher blood pressure are more likely to suffer from
osteoporosis later in life.
</P>
<P>
The scientists, from St George's Hospital in London, the London
School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, and the University of
Pittsburgh, established the link after studying more than 3,500
elderly women from four areas in the United States.
</P>
<P>
They measured bone density, rate of hip bone loss and blood
pressure in those post-menopausal women and the measurements were
repeated three and a half years later.
</P>
<P>
The study found that women with higher blood pressure had
greater and faster loss of bone minerals than those with lower
blood pressure.
</P>
<P>
Even when adjusted for factors which affect either osteoporosis
or high blood pressure, such as smoking, the researchers found
there was still a significantly greater bone loss among
hypertensive women.
</P>
<P>
Previous research showed hypertensive people excrete higher
amounts of calcium in their urine than those with low blood
pressure.
</P>
<P>
Writing in The Lancet medical journal, the researchers
suggested that calcium lost in the urine is replaced through
calcium stripped from the bone, causing bone weakening, which
could eventually result in osteoporosis.
</P>
<P>
They suggested that changes to the diet, such as cutting salt
intake, could both reduce blood pressure and delay the onset of
osteoporosis in women.
</P>
<P>
"Decreased salt intake should therefore lessen the risk of
osteoporosis and hip fractures in elderly people and also have a
blood-pressure-lowering effect," they said.

GUILIN, China, September 17 (Xinhua) -- South Korea's newly-
formed combination Kim Taek Soo/Oh Sang Eun and world
championships beaten finalists Wang Liqin/Yan Sen of China are to
face off in men's doubles final of the '99 China Grand Prix Table
Tennis here tomorrow afternoon.
</P>
<P>
Kim and Oh scored a rallied 17-21, 21-19, 21-6 victory over
their teammates Lee Chul Seung/Park Sang Joon in the semi-finals
tonight. Ironically, Kim's former partner was Park.
</P>
<P>
Wang/Yan hardly broke a sweat as the world runner-ups left
their Belgian opponents Philippe Saive and Thierry Cabrera reeling
off in a 21-9, 21-4 rout.
</P>
<P>
Wang revealed after the match they would rather take on Lee/
Park than Kim/Oh since they had an impressive record against the
former while the latter was a newly-stricken partnership they had
no experiences with.
</P>
<P>
"We would have better chances if facing Lee/Park," the lanky
player said.
</P>
<P>
In the women's doubles category, top seeds Li Ju/Wang Nan made
short work of their younger teammates Zhang Yingying/Zhang Yining
21-18, 21-19. The world champions now entertain another Chinese
pair, Li Nan and Li Ling, who came from one set down to beat
Hungarian Csilla Batrofi/Krisztina Toth 17-21, 21-19, 21-6, in
tomorrow's final.

<HEADLINE> Y2K May Bring Economic Bottleneck in U.S.: Greenspan </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, September 17 (Xinhua) -- U.S. Federal Reserve
Chairman Alan Greenspan said Friday that there was a risk of
bottlenecks in the U.S. economy resulting from the fear of Year
2000 date change, but the probability of a widespread disruption
was negligible.
</P>
<P>
Speaking before the President's Council on Year 2000
Conversion, Greenspan said he was confident that the risk of any
widespread breakdown to critical business infrastructure from the
computer bug was negligible.
</P>
<P>
"The probability of a cascading of computer failures in
mission-critical systems is now negligible, given the testing that
has been done, the backup plans that are in place and the great
adaptability and ingenuity of the American worker," Greenspan
said.
</P>
<P>
But he cautioned that the economy could still be affected,
depending on how many businesses and consumers altered their
normal buying patterns because of unwarranted fears.
</P>
<P>
The Y2K concern stems from the fact that many older computers
and software recognize only the last two digits of the year,
meaning they might mistakenly interpret "00" as 1900.
</P>
<P>
Greenspan said the private sector had spent an estimated 50
U.S. billion dollars to upgrade computer systems so that they
would not misread the date.
</P>
<P>
"Many firms and government agencies have completed their
testing, and those institutions that were late off the block are
working very diligently to be ready by the end of the year," he
said.
</P>
<P>
In terms of economic impact, Greenspan said he was now more
concerned not about the possibility of major computer failures,
but how the public and businesses might alter their spending
patterns in the months ahead.
</P>
<P>
He said that should a large number of companies decide they
want to hold even a few extra days of inventories, then the
increase in production to accommodate such "stock building could
be quite large. Bottlenecks could develop and market pressures
could ensue."
</P>
<P>
He said an even greater impact on the economy could hinge on
"the uncertain response of the American consumer as year-end
approaches."
</P>
<P>
While Greenspan said only a small number of Americans were
telling pollsters that they planned to build large stockpiles of
food, water, fuel and cash as January 1 approaches, the economy
could be affected if a larger percentage of Americans started
taking such actions because of unwarranted concerns.
</P>
<P>
Greenspan's remarks followed a joint news conference Thursday
by all federal banking regulators to let the public know that the
financial system is now ready for the date change.
</P>
<P>
Comptroller of the Currency John D. Hawke Jr. said that "99.7
percent of all federally supervised financial institutions have
finished their renovations and tests of their systems."
</P>
<P>
He said the small number of banks who have not completed their
preparations "are receiving intensive, on-site supervision to
ensure that they, too, will experience no disruptions of the
systems their customers depend upon."

<HEADLINE> Britain Rejects Fayed's Diana Murder Charge </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, September 17 (Xinhua) -- The British Foreign Office on
Friday dismissed claims by Mohamed al-Fayed that the security
service had caused the death of Princess Diana and his son Dodi.
</P>
<P>
Henri Paul, the driver of the car in which the two died in
Paris two years ago, had acted by order of Britain's MI5 and MI6
security agencies and the French intelligence service, Harrods
store owner al-Fayed told BBC radio Friday.
</P>
<P>
"He drove into the tunnel under instructions of MI6 and MI5 and
French intelligence," al-Fayed said. "They killed him. They had to
kill him, of course."
</P>
<P>
A Foreign Office spokesman said the allegations were "baseless"
and "deeply upsetting to the Royal Family and the princess's
family."
</P>
<P>
Al-Fayed has persisted with his version of events despite a
French judicial inquiry that found Paul was drunk when his
Mercedes limousine crashed at high speed into a pillar in a Paris
road tunnel on August 31, 1997.

<HEADLINE> Nomads Urged to Keep Order in N. Uganda </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>

<P>
KAMPALA, September 17 (Xinhua) -- The Karimojong, a nomad
people in northeastern Uganda, have been urged to assist the
government to restore peace and sustain development in their
region.
</P>
<P>
This call was made by Uganda's State Minister in charge of
Northern Uganda Rehabilitation Omony Ojwok at the district or
Moroto in the region Friday, Radio Uganda reported in the evening
news.
</P>
<P>
He said that without the help from the local people, it would
be much more difficult for the government to restore peace in the
region characterized by cattle rustling.
</P>
<P>
Reports here said that as many as 500 Karimojong were killed
in the fierce battle between the Bokora and the Matheniko last
week. The government intervened by sending troops into the region
to restore peace.
</P>
<P>
A military gunship was reportedly used to disperse those
engaged in fighting between the two hostile groups. President
Yoweri Museveni has confirmed that the government troops have
killed some Karimojong warriors had been killed in the clashes.
But he declined to give the exact number.
</P>
<P>
The two groups often accuse each other of rustling cattle from
their respective camps and thus engage in fighting and counter
raid. Another report said that the Karimojong warriors have some
8,000 guns, a big threat to the regional peace.
</P>
<P>
There have been loud outcries from the Parliament demanding
disarming the warriors, but the government has not yet determined
to do so.
</P>
<P>
The Karamoja area has been neglected in terms of development
by all successive post-independence governments. It's semi-arid
and characterized by lack of water supply, draught, food shortage
and poor communications.
</P>
<P>
The people there are nomads moving around in search of pasture
and water for their cattle. Cattle rustling and insecurity have
been the common feature of Karamoja.

<HEADLINE> Irish Births Outside Wedlock Hit Record </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, September 17 (Xinhua) -- The number of births outside
marriage in the Irish Republic hit 4,275 in January-March this
year, its highest level since detailed records began in 1976, the
Irish Central Statistics Office (CSO) said Friday.
</P>
<P>
Of 13,388 births registered in the first three months of this
year, 32 percent were to unmarried parents, showed CSO figures,
according to a Reuters report filed from Dublin.
</P>
<P>
The number has risen steeply since 1976, when there were 640
births outside marriage in the first quarter out of 17,000 live
births, the data showed. It has more than doubled in the past
decade, from 1,670 in January-March 1989.
</P>
<P>
The total number of births in the republic has fallen from
around 70,000 in 1976, representing a rate of 21 births per 1,000
people, to around 52,000 or 14 per 1,000 last year, the CSO was
quoted saying.

PYONGYANG, September 17 (Xinhua) -- The economic situation of
the Democratic People's Republic of Korea (DPRK) has turned better

Hong Songnam said Friday.
</P>

<HEADLINE> UK Minister Sets Out Timetable for Digital TV Turn-On </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, September 17 (Xinhua) -- The switch from analogue to
digital TV in Britain could start as early as 2006 and be
completed by 2010, British Culture Secretary Chris Smith said
Friday.
</P>
<P>
However, speaking at the Royal Television Society conference in
Cambridge, England, he stressed that the introduction of the
"digital revolution" will depend on the progress made by British
broadcasters and manufactures, with viewers' interests coming
first.
</P>
<P>
Smith promised that the government will not switch off existing
television signals until at least 95 percent of viewers have
equipped themselves with digital sets or set-top boxes.
</P>
<P>
Before switch over, digital services will also have to be
available to 99.4 percent of the population, he said, adding that
the digital equipment must be affordable for a vast majority of
population, and including those on low and fixed income and older
people.
</P>
<P>
Smith also outlined his aim that following the switch over from
existing analogue to digital television, every home in the country
with a television and telephone would have access to the Internet.
</P>
<P>
In his speech to Britain's TV industry executives in which he
claimed it was an appropriate time to "think daring thoughts,"
Smith said, "I intend to provide you with as clear a timetable as
I can so that you can plan investment with confidence."
</P>
<P>
So far about 1.5 million households in Britain, representing
about 3 million adults, receive digital television through a
satellite dish, aerial or cable.
</P>
<P>
But analogue terrestrial signals are still the only source of
television for the 70 percent of British households who do not
subscribe to pay TV.
</P>
<P>
Commercial broadcasters have been urging Smith to name a date
to switch off traditional terrestrial signals, to encourage
consumers to buy new equipment and reduce uncertainty about their
multi-billion pound investment.

<HEADLINE> Burns Overcomes Mud to Lead China Rally </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HUAIROU, Beijing, September 17 (Xinhua) -- Subaru star Briton
Richard Burns led at the end of the first leg of the China Rally
on a day of attrition that saw 26 of the 67 cars that started
failed to complete the first day.
</P>
<P>
Burns will take a 19.8 seconds lead over Frenchman Didier
Auriol, driving a Toyota, into the second leg, while reigning
world champion Tommi Makinen of Finland, on a Mitsubishi, was
poised to strike in third place just 2.6 seconds behind Auriol.
</P>
<P>
Burns' teammate Juha Kankkunen, also a Finn, was fourth from
Carlos Sainz of Spain in the second Toyota and Finn Harri
Rovanpera in the sole remaining SEAT.
</P>
<P>
Both Ford Focus dirvers, Colin McRae and Thomas Radstrom,
failed to complete even one stage before retiring and were joined
on the sidelines by Piero Liatti, also SEAT, and Freddy Loix of
Mitsubishi from the factory - backed teams.
</P>
<P>
Amazingly both Ford cars damaged their suspensions in exactly
the same way after both hit the same obstable on the third turn of
the first special stage.
</P>
<P>
"We ran over the concerete which we had noted in the recce,
without regarding it as a major hazard, but unfortunatedly it
damaged the suspension too badly to continue," McRae said.
</P>
<P>
"It's just a samll area of reliability that we need to look at,
" he added.
</P>
<P>
Makinen set the early pace and led clearly before he hit a tree
on a right hand bend damaging his rear suspension and side of the
car. He lost about 30 seconds and had to climb through the window
to get out of his car at the service park.
</P>
<P>
Mitsubishi team mechanics repaired the car that was again
running strongly at the finish of the day.
</P>
<P>
"I am a bit disappointed to have made this mistake, because it
was going so well and we were leading by over half a minute,"
Makinen said.
</P>
<P>
"There is a long way to go and I think we can keep our World
Championship lead."
</P>
<P>
Burns had set a consevative pace that paid off well for him
today.
</P>
<P>
"I very deliberately ran at the pace I thought was right for me,
the car, and the conditions," he said.
</P>
<P>
"We are only a short way into an event that is new to most of
us, so tactically the next couple of days are very difficult to
call.'
</P>
<P>
Tomorrow is the longest and most grueling day of the event and
if the forecast showers arrive it will be difficult for all
drivers.

<P>
UNITED NATIONS, September 17 (Xinhua) -- A U.N. report
highlights the critical challenges and choices facing countries as
the global population passes 6 billion -- twice what it was in
1960.
</P>
<P>
Nafis Sadik, executive director of the United Nations
Population Fund (UNFPA), will launch the report, entitled "State
of World Population 1999," in London at a press conference at the
Foreign Press Association, starting at 11:00 a.m. local time (1000
GMT), on September 22, the UNFPA said Friday.
</P>
<P>
The Day of 6 Billion will be marked next month, October 12, and
more than 78 million people will be added this year. With more
than a billion young people entering their childbearing years,
population will continue to grow well into the 21st century,
specially in poor countries.
</P>
<P>
At a landmark 1994 conference in Cairo, 179 governments agreed
that population is closely linked to prospects for alleviating
poverty, empowering women and protecting the environment.
</P>
<P>
They acknowledged the right to reproductive health, and called
for gender quality and universal access to reproductive health
care including family planning.
</P>
<P>
The UNFPA helps developing countries to improve reproductive
health and family planning based on individual choice, and to
formulate population policies in support of sustainable
development.

<HEADLINE> Botswana's Economy to Be Boosted by Diamond Sales </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, September 17 (Xinhua) -- Botswana's economy will
be boosted by diamond sales of a forecast 680 million to 700
million U.S. dollars in August, according to a report reaching
here Friday.
</P>
<P>
"The way it is going it appears that the government budget will
have a big windfall this year," Permanent Secretary in the
Botswanan Ministry of Minerals, Energy and Water Affairs, Blackie
Marole, was quoted as saying Friday.
</P>
<P>
"Our (annual budget) was based on estimates that we would sell
75 percent of our total (diamond) production, but now it looks
like will sell the entire production," he noted.
</P>
<P>
Fleming Martin and Investec Securities reportedly forecast a
largest seventh sight on record from this year's seventh diamond
sight organized by De Beers' Central Selling Organization
responsible for marketing diamonds produced in Botswana and South
Africa.  The previous largest was 550 million dollars in 1995.
</P>
<P>
Investec predicted the August sight "could reach 700 million
dollars or above," and added that the De Beers' Central Selling
Organization was poised to sell more diamonds in 1999 than any
other year on record.
</P>
<P>
The Botswanan government in January forecast a budget deficit
of 400 million pula (80 million dollars) in the current fiscal
year ending on April 30 due to the expected poor performance of
the diamond industry.
</P>
<P>
The country's mining company, Debswana -- a joint venture
between South African diamond giant De Beers and the Botswana
government -- is the world' s largest diamond producer by value.
Last year alone, it produced more than 19,000 carats.
</P>
<P>
The sale of diamonds accounts for about 80 percent of
Botswana's export revenues and 33 percent of its GDP.

<HEADLINE> Albright Indicates Hopeful Relations with DPRK </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, September 17 (Xinhua) -- U.S. Secretary of State
Madeleine Albright said on Friday that the United States is
starting on a new and more hopeful road in its relations with the
Democratic People's Republic of Korea (DPRK) following its
relaxation of sanctions on Pyongyang.
</P>
<P>
The easing of sanctions on trade between Washington and
Pyongyang was announced earlier in the day by the President Bill
Clinton who made the move on the basis of some progress on the
Berlin talks between the two countries on September 12.
</P>
<P>
Albright also said a review of policy by presidential envoy
William Perry, a former defense secretary, advocating moves to
normalize relations in return for security assurances, "start us
down a new and more hopeful road."
</P>
<P>
"It's a road that holds out the possibility of long-term
stability and even eventual reconciliation on the Korean
peninsula," she told reporters at the State Department press
conference, where Perry stood alongside with her.
</P>
<P>
But she insisted on the justification of continuing presence of
37,000 U.S. troops stationed on the territory of South Korea,
saying it was necessary to defend the security interests of the
United States.
</P>
<P>
"If circumstances warrant that we go back to square one we
can do so without damage to our interests. If circumstances
require that we go down a different road altogether we will do
so to defend our interests," she said.

LUSAKA, September 17 (Xinhua) -- Fifty-nine Zambian soldiers
were sentenced to death Friday by the Lusaka High Court for their

The court also acquitted eight other soldiers and sentenced
another soldier to 21 years of imprisonment for misprision.

Judge Japhet Banda said in his four-hour judgement that Captain
Steven Lungu, Alias Captain Solo and Jack Chiti who are believed
to have masterminded the coup and other soldiers will be hanged.

Judge Banda released the eight on account that the prosecution
has failed to prove the overt acts of treason against them.

<HEADLINE> Namibian Refugees Still in Botswana </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, September 17 (Xinhua) -- The voluntary
repatriation of Namibian separatist refugees from Botswana had not
yet been resumed, South African Press Association (SAPA) reported
Friday.
</P>
<P>
"Of the 1,055 Namibians remaining in Botswana's Dukwe refugee
camp, 178 have registered for repatriation, but remain in
Botswana," SAPA quoted Botswanan government spokesman Andrew
Sesinyi as saying.
</P>
<P>
The United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR)
suspended the exercise after the August 2 disturbances in the
Caprivi region of Namibia.
</P>
<P>
Secessionist rebels attacked the major town in Caprivi, Katima
Mulilo, leaving 15 people dead.
</P>
<P>
The Namibians had then cracked down on more members of the
separatist group, SAPA said.
</P>
<P>
This led to the arrival in Botswana of 20 more asylum seekers
from the Caprivi.
</P>
<P>
The Namibians in Dukwe were the last of 2,500 separatists who
crossed into Botswana between October and December 1998.
</P>
<P>
They were seeking the secession of the Caprivi from the
Windhoek government and told the Botswana authorities they feared
for their safety as the Namibian Defense Force was moved into the
area.
</P>
<P>
In terms of the UNHCR convention on asylum seekers, to which
both Namibia and Botswana were signatory, the 2,500 people were
granted asylum in Botswana.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Tourists to Tanzania on Rise </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, September 17 (Xinhua) -- Tanzanian President
Benjamin Mkapa said Friday that the number of U.S. tourists to his
country has kept increasing in recent years.
</P>
<P>
"The number of American tourists coming to Tanzania rose from
14,807 in 1991 to 41,200 last year, 90 percent of whom came for
holiday and game viewing, and 10 percent combined business with
holiday," Mkapa said in Washington D.C. during a working visit to
the United States.
</P>
<P>
According to a copy of his speech made available in Dar es
Salaam, Mkapa said that more and more Americans are getting to
know Tanzanian tourist attractions and the number of those
visiting is rising faster than the global average, a trend which
encourages Tanzania.
</P>
<P>
He noted that Tanzania has decided to market itself more
vigorously in the United States.
</P>
<P>
The Tanzania president revealed that his country is working
together with relevant authorities to promote direct flights from
the United States to Tanzania so that tourists do not have to come
to the east African country through Europe.
</P>
<P>
Tanzania is proud of Kilimanjaro, the highest mountain in
Africa, Ngorongoro Crater, which is described as the "eighth
wonder of the world," and Selous, the largest game reserve in the
world and the oldest in Africa.
</P>
<P>
In addition, the country has an 880-kilometer coastline of
pristine beaches and numerous possibilities for water sports, and
exotic Spice Island of Zanzibar.
</P>
<P>
Tourism has become a pillar industry in Tanzania. Last year,
some 482, 000 tourists visited Tanzania, earning the country 570
million U.S. dollars in foreign exchange.

LONDON, September 17 (Xinhua) -- European markets ended
slightly higher Friday with Britain's FTSE 100 closing higher for
only the second time in nine sessions.
</P>
<P>
The index climbed strongly in the first few hours, at one point
gaining 47 points but slipped back all the way to its opening.
</P>
<P>
The mood picked up again as the U.S. market opened positively,
but with traders cautious, the gains were modest and the FTSE 100
closed up 25.2 points at 6039.8.
</P>
<P>
However, analysts and dealers took little comfort from the
market's rebound, amid persistent fears over rising rates on both
sides of the Atlantic.
</P>
<P>
German shares on the day surrendered earlier gains to slump
into negative territory as investors shrugged off Wall Street's
positive opening and sold core industrial stocks.
</P>
<P>
The electronic Xetra Dax finished down just 0.01 percent at
5303.94, paring earlier losses.
</P>
<P>
In Paris, share prices closed marginally higher, although off
the day's highs in a nervous market driven by rumors but held back
by a lack of real news, dealers said.

The CAC-40 index ended the day 3.77 points higher at 4644.32.

<HEADLINE> UN Urges All Parties Concerned to Respect </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, September 17 (xinhua) -- The United Nations
Security Council on Friday adopted a resolution which urges all
parties concerned to comply strictly with their obligations under
international law and put an end to deliberate targeting of
civilians in situations of armed conflict as well as attacks on
objectives protected under international law.
</P>
<P>
The move came after the Security Council held two-day long
debate on measures to protect civilians in armed conflict in
response to a report submitted by Secretary-General Kofi Annan
earlier this week containing recommendations on how the United
Nations could end the practice of targeting innocent
non-combatants.
</P>
<P>
In the resolution, the Security Council strongly condemned the
deliberate targeting by combatants of civilians in armed conflict
and demanded that all parties concerned put an end to such
violations of international humanitarian and human rights law.
</P>
<P>
Emphasizing the importance of preventing conflict which could
endanger international peace and security, the Security Council
highlighted the importance of implementing appropriate preventive
measures to resolve conflicts, including the use of United Nations
and other dispute settlement mechanisms and of preventive military
and civilian deployment, in accordance with the relevant
provisions of the Charter of the United Nations, resolutions of
the Security Council and relevant international instruments.
</P>
<P>
The Council affirmed the need to bring to justice, in an
appropriate manner, individuals who incite or cause violence
against civilians in situations of armed conflict or who otherwise
violate international humanitarian and human rights law.
</P>
<P>
Noting the deleterious impact of the proliferation of arms, in
particular small arms, on the security of civilians, the Council
stressed the importance of all member States, and in particular
States involved in manufacturing and marketing of weapons,
restricting arms transfers which could provoke or prolong armed
conflicts or aggravate existing tensions or armed conflicts.
</P>
<P>
The Council expressed its willingness to respond to situations
of armed conflict where civilians are being targeted or
humanitarian assistance to civilians is being deliberately
obstructed, including through the consideration of appropriate
measures at the Council's disposal in accordance with the Charter
of the United Nations and the relevant recommendations contained
in the report of the U.N. Secretary-General.
</P>
<P>
The Council decided to establish immediately an appropriate
mechanism to review further the recommendations contained in the
report of the Secretary-General and to consider appropriate steps
by April 2000 in accordance with its responsibilities under the
Charter of the United Nations.

<HEADLINE> Tanzania Targets Mineral Exports at $337M in 2002 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, September 17 (Xinhua) -- Tanzanian President
Benjamin Mkapa Friday came up with an ambitious goal that his
country's mineral exports should reach 337 million U.S. dollars in
three years.
</P>
<P>
"We have put in place a special regime of incentives for the
mining sector that has been acknowledged to be most competitive in
the industry worldwide," Mkapa said during a working visit to the
United States.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at the National Press Club in Washington D.C., Mkapa
said prospecting investments in Tanzania have risen from 630,000
dollars in 1990, to 77.27 million in 1994 and 95.89 million in
1997.
</P>
<P>
"Last year, 57.7 million U.S. dollars, an amount equivalent to
13 percent of Africa's total mineral prospecting budget, were
invested in Tanzania, putting us ahead of even South Africa and
Ghana," Mkapa said in a speech with a copy available in Dar es
Salaam.
</P>
<P>
"We expect that everything being equal, Tanzania's mineral
exports should rise from 22.6 million U.S. dollars to 337.2
million in the year 2002," he said.
</P>
<P>
The president said that Tanzania's gemstone exports have risen
from about 1.5 million dollars in 1990 to 8.1 million last year.
Some 655 million dollars have been invested in the first five gold
mines that should all come on stream in less than five years from
now.
</P>
<P>
Since 1980s, Tanzania has given incentives in taxation to
private investors both at home and abroad to tap its vast mining
potential. Obtaining licenses has also become less difficult.
</P>
<P>
Mkapa welcomed U.S. businessmen to invest in Tanzania, which is
 described by him as a country with political stability,
well-positioned geography, abundant natural resources and
favorable polices.

<HEADLINE> Internet Engineers Crisis Looming for Europe: Report </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, September 17 (Xinhua) -- Europe will face an Internet
engineering skills crisis early next century unless more young
people undergo training, warned a new report by the International
Data Corporation (IDC).
</P>
<P>
The report predicted that by 2002, Europe will see a shortfall
of almost 600,000 individuals possessing the fundamental skills to
design, build and manage the networks that are the bedrock of
almost every business and government worldwide.
</P>
<P>
It said that the situation will only worsen unless actions are
taken by European countries to train young people as engineers to
keep pace with the explosive growth of the Internet.
</P>
<P>
Among European countries, Germany is predicted to suffer the
most of the engineers crisis with a 31.7 percent shortfall by
2002, the UK ranked second with a 13.8 percent shortage, which is
followed by France, Italy and the Netherlands.
</P>
<P>
Although business has been discussing the skills shortage for
some time, experts said that it is not until now with the
explosive use of the internet that Europe is facing a new crisis
in terms of a networking skills shortage.
</P>
<P>
However, for people willing to learn, the shortage is offering
unprecedented career opportunities, the IDC report said.

<HEADLINE> Tanzania's Trade with U.S. in Encouraging Trend: </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, September 17 (Xinhua) -- Tanzanian President
Benjamin Mkapa said Friday that although the figures for his
country's trade with the United States are still low but the trend
"is very encouraging."
</P>
<P>
During a working visit to the U.S., Mkapa said exports from
Tanzania rose form 18.8 million U.S. dollars in 1996 to 31.5
million in 1998, an increase of 68 percent in only two years.
These exports for the U.S. were mainly coffee, fish, gemstones and
other precious metals, cotton fabrics and tea.
</P>
<P>
American exports to Tanzania, on the other hand, rose from 50.1
million dollars in 1996 to 66.8 dollars last year, a 33 percent
increase. These included clothing, textiles, information
technology equipment, milk, corn and wheat.
</P>
<P>
"My message during this visit is on the need to increase the
volume of trade both ways and to narrow the trade imbalance,"
Mkapa said at the National Press Club in Washington D.C.
</P>
<P>
In a speech with a copy made available in Dar es Salaam, Mkapa
said: "I certainly would appeal for Tanzanian products to be
accepted under a Generalized System of Preferences without much
ado."
</P>
<P>
"Where the trade imbalance cannot be redressed by increased
exports from Tanzania to the U.S., larger investments by American
companies in Tanzania will be helpful, as well as increased number
of American tourists visiting Tanzania," he added.
</P>
<P>
The Tanzanian president said he had been advised that at
present American investments in Tanzania range 15 million to 20
million dollars a year in sectors such as tourism, manufacturing,
construction, transport, petroleum, fishing and agriculture.
</P>
<P>
"I wish we could make it at least 10 times that amount," he
added.

<HEADLINE> Over 75% Mozambican Voters Registered </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MAPUTO, September 17 (Xinhua) -- Mozambique's voter
registration ended Friday, with around three quarters of the
potential electorate registered.
</P>
<P>
According to the latest figures from the Electoral
Administration Technical Secretariat, around 6.2 million out of an
estimated 8.3 million people above the voting age of 18 have
registered.
</P>
<P>
But that figure refers to data collected up until September 11,
and registration brigades in remote areas have not been able to
communicate their latest figures to the secretariat. Thus, the
real number of registered voters is certain to be higher than 6.2
million.
</P>
<P>
The number of people registered in 1994 for the country's first
multi- party presidential and parliamentary elections was
6,396,061.
</P>
<P>
If the final figure from this year's exercise is lower than
that, it would be regarded as a failure.
</P>
<P>
Some of the minor political parties, notably those in the
Mozambique United Opposition coalition, have demanded that voter
registration period be extended. But there seems no chance that
this demand will be granted.
</P>
<P>
Extending voter registration to September 30, as the coalition
demands, would throw the entire electoral timetable out of joint,
thus making it impossible to hold the elections on the scheduled
dates of December 3-4.
</P>
<P>
The publication of the final results from the registration is
scheduled for October 3.

<HEADLINE> Suspected Murderer of British Acquitted in Kenya </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, September 17 (Xinhua) --A former senior official of
Kenya Wildlife Service, Simon Makallah, was acquitted Friday of
the horrible murder in 1988 of British tourist Julie Ward in a
national wildlife reserve after a 43-day trial.
</P>
<P>
Dozens of Makallah's fellow Maasai tribe men, dressed in red
shawls and beads, celebrated the acquittal outside the courtroom.
</P>
<P>
John Ward, Julie's father, was stone-faced after hearing the
verdict and said that he wanted a retrial. He had spent about
600,000 U.S. dollars in the past 11 years to hunt the murderer.
</P>
<P>
Judge Daniel Aganyanya said that prosecutors had only offered
circumstantial evidence against Makallah.
</P>
<P>
However, Ward claimed that Makallah had repeatedly talked
privately to the court assessors who advised the judge on the
case.
</P>
<P>
In July the three assessors agreed that the chief warden of
Maasai Mara Wildlife Reserve at the time of the murder was not
guilty. In most cases, judges would follow the advice from
assessors in Kenya.
</P>

<HEADLINE> Emerging Markets in U.S. Create Grand Demand for </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LOS ANGELES, September 17 (Xinhua) -- There has been a growing
demand in the United States for high-tech battery-powered devices,
according to a market analysis released Friday.
</P>
<P>
The demand is being fueled by the proliferation of wireless
communications tools, photovoltaic applications and
government-supported programs encouraging electric vehicle
markets, said the analysis report from U.S. market research firm
Frost &AMP; Sullivan.
</P>
<P>
There is a growing need for fast charging miniature batteries
and chargers due to the demands of an increasing mobile society,
the report said. The greatest challenge for manufacturers of
miniaturized chargers is to avoid battery overheating. The problem
has been solved by some vendors that develop sophisticated
electronics which automatically switch to a lower charge when the
battery is generating excess heat.
</P>
<P>
The newest addition to the charger industry is the versatile
smart charger, that changes the way it charges depending on
battery type. Smart chargers contain intelligent circuitry that
can recharge batteries much faster than other technologies.
</P>
<P>
In addition to growth in the communication and information
technology industries that is driving the demand for battery
chargers, the report said, there is a potential for growth in
medical applications, such as wheel chairs and scooters, as they
become more user-friendly and as a result of increased demand from
the aging U.S. population.
</P>
<P>
The research firm said that with the constant influx of new
electronic products on the market, products quickly become
obsolete and are replaced by newer, better versions. Therefore
vendors must monitor trends in the marketplace and try to be
always competitive.

<P>
GENEVA, September 17 (Xinhua) -- The International
Telecommunication Union (ITU) and two other organizations have
joined their effort to expand electronic commerce to developing
nations by signing here Friday a Trust Fund partnership
agreement.
</P>
<P>
By the framework to be established under the partnership
agreement, the World Trade Center Geneva will assist the ITU in
expanding the Electronic Commerce in Developing Countries project
(EC-DC) using the World Trade Center network and its global
infrastructure of more than 300 centers in more than 100
countries.
</P>
<P>
Under the agreement, a projected 2.7 million U.S. dollars will
be channeled to the Fund every year for the next three years. The
contributions will consist of donations from members of WTC Geneva
and WISeKey, a Swiss company which also joined the partnership.
</P>
<P>
"The advent of the Internet has changed the way we communicate,
conduct business, learn and entertain. But above all, it changed
the way we shop and trade," he said.
</P>
<P>
"We must act swiftly and decisively to provide developing
economies with the infocommunication infrastructure needed to join
the digital economy if we do not want to create another form of
development gap," Utsumi added.

<HEADLINE> Britain Investigates "Landmines on Sale" at Arms Fair </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, September 17 (Xinhua) -- The British Ministry of
Defense is investigating claims that illegal anti-personnel mines
were on sale this week at a government-supported arms fair, local
reports said.
</P>
<P>
Channel 4 News reported that a Romanian state-owned company was
offering mines, which was declared illegal in Britain, for sale
during the defense Systems and Equipment International(DSEi)
exhibition held currently in Surrey, south-west London.
</P>
<P>
A spokesman of the Ministry of Defense told Channel 4 News all
exhibitors at the show had promised to abide by British law, and
the ministry had vetted publicity material "to ensure compliance".
</P>
<P>
He said the ministry "will investigate the allegations."
</P>
<P>
"If any company has contravened their undertaking then the UK
will vigorously take this up with the proper authorities in the
countries concerned," he said.
</P>
<P>
Shadow Defense Secretary Iain Duncan Smith said he was
"appalled" to hear mines were on sale at the fair, which is
heavily promoted by British Ministry of Defense and the arms
industry.
</P>
<P>
"After lecturing about anti-personnel mines and indeed passing
the Landmines Act in 1998, the government appears less than
vigilant in the UK by allowing these mines to be sold," Smith
said.
</P>
<P>
The possession or sale of the deadly weapons in Britain was
banned under the 1998 Landmines Act, following a campaign
highlighted by the late Princess Diana.
</P>
<P>
The DSEi exhibition was one of the biggest arms fairs in the
world. It was opened by British Defense Secretary George
Robertson on Tuesday and was scheduled to close on Friday.

<HEADLINE> Former FIFA Chief Supports S. Africa for World Cup Bid </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, September 18 (Xinhua) -- Former FIFA boss Joao
Havelange's support for South Africa's World Cup bid was welcomed
by the South African soccer top brass on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
Havelange, who initially stood behind Brazil's bid to host the
World Cup in 2006, this week made a surprise about-turn when he
called on his country to withdraw its candidature and support the
South African bid instead.
</P>
<P>
Brazil, England, Germany and Morocco are all in the race with
South Africa to host the prestigious tournament in 2006.
</P>
<P>
The South Africa Bid Committee chief executive Danny Jordaan
said Havelange's backing would prove a major boost to this country
's campaign and if Brazil had to pull out it would leave the race
strictly between Africa and Europe.
</P>
<P>
"If that happens it would now be between Africa and Europe to
win the bid," Jordaan said. "Havelange has always been supportive
of the idea that the global character of the game be entrenched
and he has shown this with the development of many of FIFA's
competitions under his presidency.
</P>
<P>
"For years he has been saying that the game should be universal
and his message is a massive boost to us.
</P>
<P>
"We have now received the backing for our bid of the three most
powerful men in the world sports. Already FIFA president Sepp
Blatter has come out in favour of our candidature and now
Havelange.
</P>
<P>
"Last week, the International Olympic Committee president Juan
Antonio Samaranch also gave us his backing at the start of the All-
Africa Games. We now have great heart and courage thanks to their
support," Jordaan said.
</P>
<P>
Jordaan felt that the hitches encountered in the All-Africa
Games would not in anyway affect the country's World Cup bid.
</P>
<P>
"We will sit down with the All-Africa Games authorities and
make a review of the Games. The Games are a mix of all different
sporting codes, while the World Cup is only about soccer. No, I
don't think the problems in the Games will affect our bid at all,"
Jordaan said.
</P>
<P>
Havelange said this week that Brazil's poor infrastructure
would harm its chances of getting the nod and felt pulling out now
would enhance the South Americans' hopes for 2010.
</P>
<P>
"I prefer to lose a finger than a hand. To win, you have to
know how to lose. If Brazil doesn't hold the Cup in 2006, I can
guarantee it will in 2010," he reportedly said.
</P>
<P>
Supporting an African bid would ensure the continent's four
votes would come to Brazil when the the world body names the 2010
host. If Brazil got the four votes from Asia and six from the
Americas, it would have enough to beat a bid from Europe, who have
eight votes.

Damishi Sango on Saturday voiced support for South Africa's bid to

"Surely, it's Africa's turn and South Africa has all it takes

<HEADLINE> Pak-China Ties Pivotal for Regional Peace: Minister </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, September 18 (Xinhua) -- Pakistani Information
Minister Mushahid Hussain Saturday said Pakistan has always held
that its relationship with China is pivotal for peace in the
region.
</P>
<P>
Pakistan's "strong, stable and strategic ties" with China will
further expand in the 21st century, said Mushahid while addressing
a seminar on "New China in the 21st Century".
</P>
<P>
As part of the Pak-China Friendship Week launched by the
Pakistani government Saturday, the seminar was jointly organized
by the Institute of Regional Studies and the Institute of
Strategic Studies.
</P>
<P>
Mushahid described the Pak-China relationship as a model among
third world countries and said it will further deepen and become
more multi-dimensional in the next century.
</P>
<P>
He appreciated China's consistent foreign policy, saying that
the country has always upheld U.N. principles and its stands on
various issues have been in consort with international norms.
</P>
<P>
China, he said, pursues a policy of non-interference in the
internal affairs of other countries and is firmly opposed to both
"regional and global hegemonism."
</P>
<P>
Mushahid appreciated the statesmanship and sagacity of the
Chinese leadership for managing a peaceful handover of Hong Kong
and felicitated China on the forthcoming return of Macao.
</P>
<P>
Speaking on the occasion, Chinese Ambassador to Pakistan Lu
Shulin reiterated his country's policy of further consolidating
its close relationship with Pakistan, stating that China will
always remain a most reliable friend of Pakistan.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese government and the Chinese people highly value the
traditional friendship with Pakistan, Lu said, adding that the two
countries will enjoy firm friendship and stability in the 21st
century.
</P>
<P>
"It is a firmly set policy for China to further consolidate and
develop our friendship and cooperation. This policy will never
change. China will, as always, remain the most reliable friend of
Pakistan," said the ambassador.
</P>
<P>
Delivering their speeches at the seminar, defense and
international relations experts said the deep friendship between
Pakistan and China not only serves the interests of the two
countries but also contributes to regional peace and global
stability.

<HEADLINE> UK Fast Food Chains Ban GM </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, September 18 (Xinhua) -- Britain's biggest fast-food
chains, including McDonald's and Burger King, have said they have
removed genetically-modified (GM) ingredients from their menus in
time for the introduction of new labeling laws.
</P>
<P>
Friends of the Earth surveyed 11 leading chains and found all
said they did not use GM soya or maize, according to BBC.
</P>
<P>
The British government has ordered all food containing GM
ingredients to be labeled from Sunday following implementation of
a European Union directive last September. Caterers, shops,
food-makers and restaurants must all comply or face fines.
</P>
<P>
Two of the companies surveyed, Pret a Manger and Domino's
Pizza, said they had removed GM derivatives while a further six
said they were removing them.
</P>
<P>
Pete Riley, senior food campaigner at FoE, said: "This survey
shows that restaurants recognise that customers do not want to eat
food containing GM ingredients or derivatives and that most are
now removing them as fast as they can."
</P>
<P>
"However, restaurants might well ask why they have to go to all
the trouble and expense to ensure that their meals don't contain
ingredients that neither they nor their customers want," Riley
said. "Surely the bill should be picked up by the big biotech
companies who stand to make vast sums of money from this new
technology."
</P>
<P>
Several major supermarket chains, including Sainsury's and
Marks and Spencer, are removing all GM ingredients from own-brand
ranges. Their decisions follow that of frozen food retailer
Iceland, which announced that none of its own-label produce would
contain GM ingredients in April 1998.

<P>
ATHENS, September 18 (Xinhua) -- Defense Ministers of Greece
and Cyprus held talks here Saturday and both sides reconfirmed the
joint defense policy between their two countries.
</P>
<P>
Greek Defense Minister Akis Tsohatzopoulos and his visiting
Cyprus counterpart, Sokratis Hasikou, discussed the further
support of the existing defense policies, cooperation in military
training and equipment, and the European prospect of the island
republic, which has been divided since 1974 when Turkish troops
invaded and occupied the northern third of Cyprus in the wake of a
failed coup seeking union with Athens.
</P>
<P>
Speaking after their talks, Tsohatzopoulos said that the better
climate created by the recent earthquakes in Turkey and Greece did
not influence the policy of securing stability and defense
capability. The defense strategy was influenced only by the
development of political and realistic elements, he added.
</P>
<P>
The joint military exercise would take place as scheduled from
October 2 to 7.

<HEADLINE> Private Sector Trade Through Shanghai Port Increasing Dramatically </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHANGHAI, September 18 (Xinhua) -- Imports and exports by China
's private sector at the port of Shanghai were worth 75.34 million
U.S. dollars for the January to August period, or 6.5 times the
amount for the same period last year, according to official
statistics.
</P>
<P>
For the first eight months, private businesses in China
exported 66.49 million U.S. dollars worth of goods and imported 8.
85 million U.S. dollars worth here, or 5.3 times and 7.9 times
more than last year's amount respectively on a year-on-year basis.
</P>
<P>
The rapid increase has been attributed to a new Foreign Trade
and Economic Cooperation Ministry policy at the beginning of the
year, allowing some private enterprises to handle their own export
and import business directly.
</P>
<P>
Shanghai Customs officials said that they will provide the same
preferential policies for the private sector as they do for state-
owned enterprises.
</P>
<P>
They also said that at present the market for private sector's
exports through the Shanghai port is mainly centered in India,
Italy and the United States. Hence, there is more room for
development, they added.

<HEADLINE> UK Government to Aid Farmers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, September 18 (Xinhua) -- The British Ministry of
Agriculture has confirmed that the government is to announce a new
aid package, worth around 80 million pounds (about 128 million
U.S. dollars), for cash-strapped cattle and sheep farmers in the
country.
</P>
<P>
Officials are putting the final touches to the package this
weekend and it is likely to be announced on Monday afternoon,
according to a BBC report.
</P>
<P>
The aim of the new subsidy is to help meet the cost of "red
tape" regulations which UK farmers say is adding to the price of
beef and lamb and making UK meat uncompetitive.
</P>
<P>
A spokesman said the new aid, to apply to farmers in England,
Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland, was fresh money and it would
help meet the extra costs imposed on farmers before sending their
animals to abbatoirs.
</P>
<P>
There would also be money to help meet the cost of the passport
scheme for beef cattle which was imposed in the wake of BSE. But
it was not clear yet whether the scheme would apply to pigs as
well as cattle and sheep.
</P>
<P>
The spokesman said this aid was aimed at reimbursing farmers
for the bureaucratic burdens which had been imposed on them.
</P>
<P>
The question of whether there should be help to buy up unwanted
sheep and other animals, as proposed by the Scottish and Welsh
Parliaments - was separate.
</P>
<P>
Nick Brown, the agriculture minister, was waiting to hear
details from the farming ministers in Edinburgh and Cardiff and
would then take it up with the European Commission.

<HEADLINE> Chinese Strongmen Are Climbing up Tough Road </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WEINAN, SHAANXI, China, September 18 (Xinhua) -- The Chinese
young strongmen do make their impacts in the fourth Chinese City
Games but are still climbing up a tough road for great feats in
the world.
</P>
<P>
As the weightlifting competitions concluded here on Saturday,
the strongmen aged under 20 surpassed three world junior marks by
three persons in eight categories.
</P>
<P>
Besides, two Asian junior records were attacked and six
national junior marks were set up in the City Games with all the
competitions to be concluded on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
Shi Zhiyong, a 19-year-old teenager from Xiamen, Fujian
province, surpassed two world junior records in the 62-kg category.
</P>
<P>
"I just hope to win the gold medal in the 2000 Olympic Games,
and to improve my skills to lift a two-lift total of 330 kgs,"
said the young strongman.
</P>
<P>
However, the concerned Chinese sports authorities are well
aware of the dire fact that no breakthrough was ever made in the
heavy classes as the City Games failed to produce any successor
for Cui Wenhua.
</P>
<P>
"Although five strongmen broke three national junior marks,
their winning results lag far behind the world bests by a huge
margin," said Qian Guangjian, secretary general of the Chinese
Weightlifting Association.
</P>
<P>
"And the worst nagging problem is the lack of future stars with
potentials as Shi Zhiyong, Guo Guan and Wu Qinghua all compete in
the smaller categories of either 62kg or 69kg classes," said the
official.
</P>
<P>
As a sport dated back to ancient Greece, weightlifting offers
eight gold medals for the strongmen in the Olympic Games.

<HEADLINE> AIDS Ails Farm Production in Africa </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
(By Chen Qiaoyan)
</P>
<P>
LUSAKA, September 18 (Xinhua) -- Agricultural production has
been affected in Sub-Saharan Africa as increasing number of
farmers die of AIDS.
</P>
<P>
According to a report released at the 11th International
Conference on AIDS and STDS (sexually transmitted diseases) in
Africa in Lusaka, the HIV/ AIDS pandemic is not only a health
issue, but also a serious problem for development in general.
</P>
<P>
HIV/AIDS has severely reduced the active production force in
the labor intensive agriculture sector, the report said.
</P>
<P>
In Zambia, maize output in some provinces fell by over 30
percent during 1997/1998 season.
</P>
<P>
Although lack of inputs and climatic conditions were partly to
blame for this decline, AIDS-related loss of labor attributed
largely to the reduction of output.
</P>
<P>
According to a report released by Joint United Nations Program
on HIV/ AIDS (UNAIDS) and World Health Organization, it is
estimated that in 1998, 7o percent of newly infected with HIV, the
virus which causes AIDS, live in Sub-Saharan Africa. And 83
percent of AIDS deaths have taken place in the region, which
accounts for only one-tenth of the world population, since the
epidemic started.
</P>
<P>
By the end of 1998, it is estimated that there were about 21.5
million adults and one million children infected with HIV in black
Africa.
</P>
<P>
A FAO study found that the commercial agriculture sector of
Kenya is particularly vulnerable to the epidemic and is facing a
severe social and economic crisis.
</P>
<P>
After studying the impacts, FAO is moving into a new phase of
examining the possible responses from the agricultural sector to
the epidemic. And it will jointly with UNAIDS issue a report,
which is entitled "The Sustainable Agricultural, Rural Development
and Vulnerability to HIV/AIDS."
</P>
<P>
The organization suggests that these challenges have to be
taken into account when outlining and implementing agricultural
and rural development programs in the region.

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, September 18 (Xinhua) -- The Central Committee of the
Chinese Communist Party (CPC), the State Council and the Central
Military Commission said in a decision today that they were
awarding medals to 23 scientists who made China's first atomic
bomb, its first H-bomb, and its first satellite.
</P>
<P>
The nuclear bomb and satellite development were some of the
greatest achievements of the past 50 years, something the whole
Chinese nation feels proud of, the decision said.
</P>
<P>
China detonated its first atomic bomb on October 16, 1964 and
its first H-bomb on June 17, 1967. On April 24, 1970, it put its
first satellite into orbit. These successes demonstrated the
creativity of the Chinese and had a far-reaching effect in China
and abroad and laid a solid foundation to improve China's global
status, it said.
</P>
<P>
In the process, a legion of excellent scientists and
researchers was produced, who have made great contributions to the
country's hi-tech developments and industries, it said.
</P>
<P>
The awarding of meritorious service medals for these
specialists on the eve of the 50th anniversary of the People's
Republic of China will increase Chinese people's revolutionary
spirit and support the traditions and help implement the strategy
of revitalizing the nation and increasing military strength
through science and technology, the decision said. It asked the
nation to learn from these people, to rally around the CPC Central
Committee with Jiang Zemin at its core, and to strive to be more
successful in the reforms, opening up, and modernization.

<HEADLINE> Runner Lan Lixin Wins Second Gold in City Games </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
XI'AN, China, September 18 (Xinhua) -- Runner Lan Lixin, a
disciple of coach Ma Junren, took her second gold medal in the
fourth Chinese City Games here on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
As the track and field competitions concluded, two Asian junior
records were surpassed in the Chinese City Games in both the women
's pole vault and the women's 4x400m relay with neither Asian nor
world marks.
</P>
<P>
Lan, who triumphed in the 1,500 meters on Thursday, enjoyed her
clear advantage by taking the women's 5,000 meters in 15:29.25,
but her winning mark is still far behind the world mark of 14:28.
09 set by her compatriot Jiang Bo in October, 1997.
</P>
<P>
"Our runners are a competitive group," said Lan Lixin, 20,
world 1,500m junior champion who clocked 4:10.05 in France in July,
1998," Coach Ma has urged us to run for the gold medal by
displaying our strength on the track."
</P>
<P>
The men's 5,000m race was also won by Ma's disciple Li Aiguo,
who was eventually disqualified as he stepped upon the shoe of his
opponent in the final sprint.
</P>
<P>
However, of the 43 gold medals offered in the athletics
competitions, at least five disciplines coached by Ma Junren stand
atop the podium.
</P>
<P>
The women runners from Dalian, Liaoning province, remain the
dominating force in the middle and long-distance races as they
took the top two places in the 1,500 meters wherein seven runners
entered the 12-member final.
</P>
<P>
"Our athletes have displayed their strength on the overall
level, and we hope for more good results in future in the world
with our scientific training and administration," said Shan
Xiutang, assistant director of the Chinese Athletics
Administrative Center.
</P>
<P>
Ma Junren, who attended the City Games as an observer, stole
the limelight in the world track arena in 1993 when his women
disciples took titles in the 1993 world championships in Stuttgart,
Germany with two games records.
</P>
<P>
In September, 1993, three world records were created by his
women runners, including Wang Junxia and Qu Yunxia, in the 1,500m,
3,000m and 10,000m races at the seventh Chinese National Games in
Beijing.

<HEADLINE> Xinhua Article on Continued Fight Against Falun Gong </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, September 18 (Xinhua) -- The Xinhua News Agency, in a
commentator's article today, says that China needs to be
completely successful in the fight against the Falun Gong cult.
</P>
<P>
So far, there has been some success in the struggle against Li
Hongzhi and his illegal organization and the majority of Falun
Gong practitioners in China have severed ties with the group, the
article says. But people also need to be aware of the fact that
although the social tumor of Falun Gong has been removed, viruses
have not been fully destroyed and are still attacking society, it
says.
</P>
<P>
A small number of Falun Gong core members have not reconciled
themselves to their failures and are attempting to oppose the
government, society, and the public, the article says, and the
struggle against the organization is a serious political fight
that could be long and complicated.
</P>
<P>
While the education and transforming of the majority of Falun
Gong practitioners continues, people should do their best to
isolate and attack Li Hongzhi and other core members and punish
them in accordance with the law, it says.
</P>
<P>
Stability is in the fundamental interest of the country,
especially when the nation is preparing to celebrate the 50th
anniversary of the People's Republic of China, it says. So people
need to be vigilant against the hidden dangers left by the Falun
Gong organization and take prompt and resolute action to nip them
in the bud and be completely successful in the fight against the
organization, it concludes.

<HEADLINE> Chinese President Praises Nuclear Scientists (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, September 18 (Xinhua) -- President Jiang Zemin praised
the Chinese scientists who made the country's first atomic bomb, H-
bomb, and satellites in the 60s and early 70s, at a commendation
meeting here today.
</P>
<P>
Jiang said that the scholars and scientists helped strengthen
China's scientific and defense capability and helped lay the
cornerstone of China's global position through their untiring
efforts over several generations. China has become one of the few
countries with independent knowledge of nuclear and space
technology and is setting the pace in some key technological
fields, he said.
</P>
<P>
The meeting was sponsored by the Central Committee of the
Communist Party of China (CPC), the State Council, and the Central
Military Commission (CMC) and presided over by Li Peng, the
chairman of the National People's Congress Standing Committee.
Premier Zhu Rongji made the announcement to hold the meeting to
commend 23 experts, seven of whom are deceased and one of whom is
in hospital.
</P>
<P>
Jiang, also general secretary of the CPC Central Committee and
chairman of the CMC, conferred the meritorious services medals in
person to the 15 scientists who were present at the meeting. He
said that the decision to develop nuclear weapons and satellites
was made by Mao Zedong in the 50s and 60s to counter the extortion
and monopoly of nuclear power by some major countries and to boost
China's defense capability and safeguard world peace.
</P>
<P>
He quoted Deng Xiaoping as saying that without atomic warheads
and the H-bomb or its own satellite, China could not have become a
major country with important influence or have attained the
international status it has today.

China detonated its first atomic bomb on October 16, 1964 and
fired its first ground-to-ground missile with a nuclear warhead on
October 27, 1966. On June 17, 1967, it exploded its first nuclear
bomb in the air, and on April 24, 1970, it launched its first
satellite. Jiang said that these were scientific miracles that
took place under fragile material and technological conditions.
</P>
<P>
He named five important principles learned from this that
should still be followed:
</P>
<P>
-- Upholding unified leadership of the CPC and giving full play
to the political advantages of socialism in China;
</P>
<P>
-- Self-reliance and creativity in science and technology
exploration and actively learning key technology from foreign
countries;
</P>
<P>
-- Trying to do certain things and not doing others and
focusing on development of new and high technology and science;
</P>
<P>
-- Greater investment in education and technology and experts
being paid more respect; and
</P>
<P>
-- Making an effort to improve management for quality and
efficiency.
</P>
<P>
Jiang stressed the implementation of the strategy of
rejuvenating the country through science and education. He asked
Chinese scientists to keep abreast of international research
developments and to cultivate a new generation of experts and
talented people to contribute to the economic development and
national security of China.
</P>
<P>
Also present at the meeting along with 6,000 people from
various walks of life were the other members of the Standing
Committee of the Political Bureau of the CPC Central Committee Li
Ruihuan, Hu Jintao, Wei Jianxing and Li Lanqing.

<HEADLINE> Int'l Conference for Gurkhas Opens in Nepal </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KATHMANDU, September 18 (Xinhua) -- An international conference
for equal rights to Gurkha soldiers who served in the British army
began in Kathmandu Saturday.
</P>
<P>
The conference began with a mass rally of about 30,000
ex-Gurkha soldiers and their families who paraded four kilometers
from the neighboring Lalitpur to Kathmandu.
</P>
<P>
At the three-day conference, the plight of retired Gurkha
soldiers from the British army and their families will be
discussed and participants will look for ways for their demands
for equal treatment and pensions to be satisfied.
</P>
<P>
The main purpose of the conference is to raise international
attention for the plight of retired Gurkha soldiers and their
families and to demand equal rights as the British soldiers, said
Yam Bahadur Gurung, general secretary of the central committee of
the Gurkha Army Ex. Servicemen Organization (GAESO).
</P>
<P>
"This is the first international conference of the kind, as we
have invited delegates from 37 countries, such as Britain, Sweden,
Germany, America, Russia, Portugal, India, and so on," said
Gurung, who served in the British army from 1969 to 1979 and was a
lieutenant.
</P>
<P>
Some of the delegates are lawyers, historians, human rights
activists , anthropologists, he said.
</P>
<P>
GAESO has been pushing for equal pensions for retired Gurkha
soldiers for the past five years. It has put forward four demands
for them: pensions for all former Gurkha soldiers who were sent
back without any pensions; equal pensions with their British
counterparts; residential visas for Britain and arrangement of
education and employment for the half-educated children of former
Gurkha soldiers.
</P>
<P>
GAESO said that according to official estimates of the British
government, about 450,000 Nepali soldiers had fought for Britain
during the First and Second World Wars, and 2,500 to 3,000 Nepali
soldiers are still serving in the British army.
</P>
<P>
After retirement, a British soldier receives 760 U.S. dollars
per month, but his Nepalese counterpart gets only 32 dollars per
month. Some Gurkha soldiers who fought during the two world wars
were sent home even without any pension.
</P>
<P>
"We are not begging, we are just seeking for equal rights,"
said Gurung.
</P>
<P>
All those who took part in the rally held a sign with slogans
on it. Some of them read: "We want justice for living." "Stop
discriminations against the Gurkhas." "We want equal rights from
the British government."
</P>
<P>
The British army started to draft Gurkhas in 1816 under the
Sugauli Treaty signed between Nepal and the East India Company of
Britain. Altogether 15,000 Gurkha soldiers have been killed in
wars so far.

<HEADLINE> Auriol Steps into Driving Position </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HUAIROU, Beijing, September 18 (Xinhua) -- Frenchman Didier
Auriol drove his Toyota into a 10.7-second advantage after 16
stages in the China Rally on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
Auriol, who is second in the world championship following Tommi
Makinen, took up the front running at the end of the second leg of
the rally with only six much easier stages left in the 11th round
of the World Rally Championship.
</P>
<P>
The major drama of the day was the retirement of world champion
Makinen who stopped his Mitsubishi in the final stage of the day
with suspension failure.
</P>
<P>
Overnight leader Briton Richard Burns of Subaru remains in
second place, a comfortable 48.6 seconds ahead of the second
Toyota Corolla driven by Spaniard Carlos Sainz.
</P>
<P>
Juha Kankkunen, also from Subaru, is a distant fourth almost
four minutes behind the leader and in turn 1:30.6 ahead of his
fellow Finn Harri Rovanpera in a SEAT.
</P>
<P>
Auriol finished the day with his heart beating just a little
bit faster than at the start.
</P>
<P>
"The last stage was just unbelievable," he said. "It was so
slippery - you could be in sixth gear at 180kmh and try to brake
and the car just wouldn't slow down, it kept sliding and sliding.
</P>
<P>
"It happended many times and was very difficult on the heart.
It was a nightmare. I never want to do that again."
</P>
<P>
Makinen, who is seeking for his fourth straight world win, had
moved back into third place before that stage and looked ready to
mount a strong challenge on the final day.
</P>
<P>
The Finn was clearly the quickest driver on the day with four
fastest times before his demise, but his 10-point advantage on the
drivers championship could have been completely cut off if Auriol
would have won the China Rally.
</P>
<P>
Burns and Sainz shared the remaining benchmarks with speeds
much higher than on day one.
</P>
<P>
Over half the starting field have now succumbed to the rough
roads and bad weather as the rally has announced 37 retirements so
far, with 30 cars still running.
</P>
<P>
Japanese Toshihiro Arai of Subaru led the Group N field by 29.7
seconds from Hamed Al Wahaibi of Oman with Gustavo Trelles of
Uraguay a distant third.

</P>
<P>
The Community Planting Days, organized by the Provisional Urban

<HEADLINE> Advance Team of U.N. Force to Arrive in E.Timor Sunday </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, September 18 (Xinhua) -- A 13-member advance team of
the United Nations multinational force is scheduled to arrive on
Sunday in Dili, capital of East Timor, Antara news agency reported
Saturday.
</P>
<P>
In a telephone interview with Antara, Chief of the Military
Operational Command in East Timor Maj. Gen. Kiki Sjahnakri said
the advance team and the martial law authority will discuss the
arrival and the task of the main body of the U.N. force.
</P>
<P>
The team had been scheduled to arrive in Dili on Saturday, but
the U.N. has delayed its arrival.
</P>
<P>
Kiki said the fact that both the Indonesian Military (TNI) and
the U.N. had yet to agree on the cooperation scheme might have
caused the delay.
</P>
<P>
In a bid to create a conducive climate prior to the arrival of
a multinational force in Dili, the martial law authority in East
Timor has continued seizing guns from pro-integrationist groups,
Antara said.
</P>
<P>
Streets in Dili remained deserted on Saturday, as arson and
looting committed by refugees and unarmed members of pro-autonomy
groups again erupted in several parts of Dili, Antara said, adding
that security personnel were forced to open fire in the air to
drive away the arsonists and the looters.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the plan to drop food supplies from airplanes agreed
to by TNI, the U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) and the
International Commission of the Red Cross (ICRC) has not been
started due to technical problems.
</P>
<P>
TNI, the UNHCR and the ICRC had yet to find the right place to
drop the food deliveries for East Timorese taking refuge in safer
places, Kiki said.

<HEADLINE> Unfancied Liu Guozheng Wins Men's Singles Title </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GUILIN, China, September 18 (Xinhua) -- Last minute substitute
Liu Guozheng became the revelation of the '99 China Grand Prix
Table Tennis Championships as the unfancied Chinese paddler won
the men's singles title here on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
Liu, entering the tournament as the understudy of injury-hit
former world champion Kong Linhui, toughed out a 21-11, 17-21, 12-
21, 21-15, 21-19 victory over South Korean Lee Chul Seung in the
final and pocketed 12,500 U.S. dollars prize money.
</P>
<P>
It was the first major title for Liu, one of the unsung heroes
from the star-studded Chinese men's squad, and it came the hard
way.
</P>
<P>
He took the biggest scalp of the tournament by eliminating his
world champion teammate Liu Guoliang, who he is not related to
though they bear similar names, in the third round, before
overcoming another glamour Chinese compatriot Wang Liqin, ITTF Pro-
Tour finals winner, in the semi-finals earlier today.
</P>
<P>
"Today is a very important day in my career," said the jubilant
player, "Finally I translated my training efforts into a major
title."
</P>
<P>
Liu Guozheng revealt that he had an impressive record against
Liu Guoliang in the training camp but lack of strong nerves at
crucial moments often cost him in the big events.
</P>
<P>
But the absence of top European players, especially Sweden's
Jan-ove Waldner, Vladimir Samsonov of Belarus and Croatian Zoran
Primorac, made Liu's triumph less convincing in a depleted men's
singles field.
</P>
<P>
In the following men's doubles final, Chinese duo Wang Liqin/
Yan Sen thrashed the South Korean pair Kim Taek Soo/Oh Sang Eun 21-
15, 21-19 to take the gold and ensure the host nation make it four
out of four in an another major tournament.
</P>
<P>
Earlier today, Chinese world number three Li Ju scored a walk-
over victory over Chinese-born German Qianhong Gotsch, who quit
the final due to a fever after a gutsy four-set win over world
champion and top seed Wang Nan in the semi-finals.
</P>
<P>
Li Nan and Lin Ling toppled the world championships-winning
combination Wang Nan and Li Ju to claim the women's doubles title.
</P>
<P>
Last month China swept the board at the 45th table tennis world
championships, bagging home all five gold and silver medals on
offer.
</P>
<P>
The China Grand Prix, an ITTF Pro-Tour event, officially came
to end here today.

<HEADLINE> Havelange: Brazil Should Back South Africa in World Cup Bid </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SAO PAULO, September 17 (Xinhua) -- Former FIFA President Joao
Havelange has obviously changed his mind as he voiced out his
support to South Africa in its bid for hosting the 2006 World Cup
finals.
</P>
<P>
Havelange, who had been one of the main supporters of the
Brazilian bid, said his country's lack of infrastructure hurt its
chances. South Africa, Morocco, Germany and England are other
bidding sides for soccer's quadrennial championship.
</P>
<P>
"I would like the 2006 Cup to be in South Africa and the
following one in Brazil," Havelange was quoted at a ceremony
Thursday to promote an international congress for soccer-related
businesses.
</P>
<P>
Heading FIFA for more than two decades, Havelange was
considered a key lobbyist for Brazil's bid. However, he said his
reversal was simply for increasing Brazil's chances of succeding
in getting the Cup in 2010.
</P>
<P>
"I prefer to lose a finger than a hand. To win, you have to
know how to lose," he was quoted as saying. "If Brazil doesn't
hold the Cup in 2006, I can guarantee it will in 2010."
</P>
<P>
Havelange suggests that supporting an African bid now will
ensure the continent's four votes when the FIFA Executive
Committee choses the 2010 host.
</P>
<P>
If Brazil also gets all four votes from Asia and six from the
Americas, it would virtually assure itself a bid from Europe,
which has eight votes.
</P>
<P>
However, the Asian Football Confederation have irked some in
South America by publicly arguing that CONMEBOL should give up its
half berth in the 2002 finals to Asia.
</P>
<P>
Asia had been demanding five full berths and the half from
South America along with a half offered by Europe would have met
that demand. The AFC and FIFA president Sepp Blatter last week
signed an agreement in which the Asian confederation agreed to its
4 1-2 berths without further threatening to boycott the event's
qualifiers rounds.
</P>
<P>
Brazil is the only country in the world to win the tournament
four times. The 2002 World Cup will be jointly staged by Japan
and South Korea.

<HEADLINE> Australian Swimmer Awarded in Cuba </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HAVANA, September 17 (Xinhua) -- With President Fidel Castro's
presence, Cuba on Friday awarded Australian woman swimmer Susie
Maroney a "heroine of world sport" for completing marathon swims
to and from the Caribbean island.
</P>
<P>
Maroney, 24, received the title in a special ceremony attended
by Cuban government officlas, just days after finishing an
exhausting swimming odyssey of more than 35 hours from Jamaica to
Cuba.
</P>
<P>
It was her third swim of more than 145 kilometers in the last
few years. She had previously crossed from Cuba to the United
States in 1996 and from Mexico to Cuba in 1998.
</P>
<P>
At the ceremony in Havana's Palace of the Revolution, the
Australian swimmer received a special certificate from Cuba's
Council of State, which described her an "extraordinary heroine of
world sport" for her brave swims.
</P>
<P>
Castro presented her with the certificate, planting a kiss on
both her cheeks.
</P>
<P>
"I am very honoured to be here. I am overwhelmed with
everybody's kindness," Maroney said after receiving the award. "I
fell in love with Cuba in 1996 when I first attempted Cuba to the
United States. The water was so blue and beautiful," she added.
</P>
<P>
The Cuban president had designed and donated the shark cage
that protected the swimmer during her latest crossing from Montego
Bay, Jamaica to Marea del Portillo beach in Cuba's eastern Granma
Province.
</P>
<P>
The Australian completed her latest swim Tuesday despite waves
whipped up by the passage of Hurricane Floyd, early damage to the
shark-cage, and numerous jelly-fish stings. "I love the challenge,
pushing my body," she said.
</P>
<P>
Cuban swimmer Rodolfo Falcon, a two-time Olympic champion, read
a tribute to Maroney praising both her feats in the water and
achievements as a humanitarian campaigner for various health
causes such as leukaemia victims and the disabled.
</P>
<P>
Senior Cuban sports' officials presented Maroney with three
trophies for the crossings. The ceremony was broadcast live
across Cuba on state TV.

<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, September 18 (Xinhua) -- Nearly half a million Overseas
Filipino Workers (OFWs) were deployed all over the world in the
first half of this year as the Philippine government almost
doubled the number of pre-employment orientation seminars for
prospective OFWs during the period, said an official report.
</P>
<P>
The report, which was released here by the presidential office,
said that 458,278 OFWs were deployed over the year's first
semester, as against the 452,550 persons who found overseas
employment a year earlier.
</P>
<P>
It said 359,819 of these newly deployed OFWs bagged land-based
jobs, while the remaining were sea-based workers.
</P>
<P>
"The Philippine Overseas Employment Administration has been
doubling its efforts in its information campaign and workers'
employment programs so prospective OFWs can make wise decisions
before they apply for work abroad," the report said.
</P>
<P>
The agency has almost doubled to 476 pre-employment seminars
nationwide in the first six months of the year, compared with 246
in the same period of last year, it said.
</P>
<P>
According to official figures, over 4 million OFWs are working
in 182 foreign destinations and earn the country about 6 billion
U.S. dollars a year.

<HEADLINE> New UNFICYP Caretaker Chief Appointed </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NICOSIA, September 18 (Xinhua) -- Cypriot President Glafcos
Clerides has announced that Chilean James Holger will be the
caretaker chief of the U.N. Peacekeeping Force in Cyprus (UNFICYP).
</P>
<P>
Clerides made the announcement upon his arrival in New York on
Thursday night to the attend the 54th session of the U.N. General
Assembly.
</P>
<P>
Holger has served with the U.N. in Cyprus in the past and Dame
Ann Hercus, who has resigned as UNFICYP chief for personal
reasons, will leave at the end of the month, the Cyprus Mail
newspaper reported on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
Holger will be the caretaker chief until former Norwegian
Foreign Minister Jan Egland is appointed UNFICYP chief.
</P>
<P>
Hercus, from New Zealand, launched on-island contacts with
Cyprus' two sides last October with a view to make progress
towards the reduction of tensions and a settlement to Cyprus
problem.
</P>
<P>
Cyprus has been divided into the Turkish Cypriots-controlled
north and the Greek Cypriots-dominated south since 1974 when
Turkish Troops invaded and occupied the northern third of the
island in the wake of a failed coup seeking union with Athens.
</P>
<P>
The U.N. has been trying for decades to reunite the island with
a bi-communal federation formula, but the talks between the two
rival sides have been stalled since 1997.
</P>
<P>
The UNFICYP was established in 1964 and the 1,200-strong
peacekeepers are patroling the 180-kilometer line dividing the two
rival sides.

<HEADLINE> From Beiping to Beijing (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, September 18 (Xinhua) -- The Chinese capital, Beijing,
has become a prosperous modern metropolis in the past 50 years and
a symbol of New China.
</P>
<P>
The decision of the Chinese Communist Party Central Committee
to choose Beijing as the nation's capital provided a solid
foundation for the liberation of the whole country and the
estalishment of New China, and the Party has satisfied the people
with what it has achieved, says a former employee of the municipal
government, Ma Ju.
</P>
<P>
The city has preserved intact many historic sites that survived
artillery shells during the liberation of the city in late January
of 1949. Before the offensive was mounted, two soldiers were
dispatched to Qinghua University with a military map to look for
prominent architect Liang Sicheng, who was to be asked to mark all
the places of historic interest so as to avoid them from shelling.
</P>
<P>
The city served as the capital of 6 dynasties. It gained a new
life when the People's Liberation Army seized the city on January
31, 1949. On the morning of March 23, the CPC Central Committee
leaders Mao Zedong, Zhu De, Liu Shaoqi, Zhou Enlai and Ren Bishi
left their headquarters in the village of Xibaipo for Beijing,
which was called Beiping at that time.
</P>
<P>
A preparatory meeting of the First National Committee of the
Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference (CPPCC) was
convened in Beiping on June 15. Six panels were organized to make
preparations for the first meeting of the CPPCC National Committee
and for the formation of a democratic united government.

The Kuomintang chose Nanjing as its capital, because of its
heavy dependence on the imperialists and its closeness to the
imperialist center Shanghai, but the People's Republic of China
did not need to select Nanjing because it is the Chinese people's
country and relies on the Chinese people, Shen Yanbing, a writer
and deputy head of Panel Six, wrote in a report to the first CPPCC
National Committee meeting.
</P>
<P>
Shen cited Beiping's political, cultural, and ideological
significance and geological advantages to convince the CPPCC
members that it would be the ideal location for the capital of New
China. He also proposed that it be renamed Beijing.
</P>
<P>
On September 27, the First Plenary Session of the CPPCC
National Committee approved the national flag design, the capital,
and the anthem, and then Beiping was renamed Beijing.
</P>
<P>
On October 1, Mao Zedong declared the Central People's
Government of the People's Republic of China founded, and a new
chapter opened in the history of the country and of Beijing.

<HEADLINE> Estrada Says Marcoses Have No Deal to Call off </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, September 18 (Xinhua) -- Philippine President Joseph
Estrada said Saturday that the family of the late President
Ferdinand Marcos could not have backed off from a compromise deal
with his administration, as there is no deal to speak of in the
first place.
</P>
<P>
In a weekly program aired over the People's Television here,
Estrada stressed that all agreements involving the Marcoses should
go through the Presidential Commission on Good Government (PCGG)
headed by former Justice Magdangal Elma.
</P>
<P>
"In the first place, how can they call off a deal that does not
exist?" the president said.
</P>
<P>
The president was reacting to reports that the Marcoses had
withdrawn from a 75-25 percent share deal supposedly worked out
with the government in its efforts to recover the alleged
ill-gotten Marcos wealth.
</P>
<P>
The reports quoted an unnamed relative of the Marcoses as
saying the deal was cut off since President Estrada could not
"defend" his decision to enter into a compromise settlement with
them.
</P>
<P>
"There is no agreement to defend. How can we defend it when
there is no agreement to speak of?" Estrada said.
</P>
<P>
Estrada said he has already assured former President Corazon
Aquino that the government will not enter into an agreement with
the Marcoses on their alleged ill-gotten wealth.
</P>
<P>
He said that Elma, a former executive secretary and trusted
ally of Corazon Aquino, would be the first to know about any deal
with the Marcoses because this would have to go through him.

COLOMBO, September 18 (Xinhua) -- At least 56 Sinhalese
villagers were killed by Tamil rebels who attacked three villages
in eastern Sri Lanka in the early hours of Saturday morning,
police sources said.
</P>

Sri Lanka on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The LTTE said in a statement that 22 Tamil civilians were
killed and 41 others wounded in an air raid on the village of

<HEADLINE> Piracy under Control in HK: Customs Commissioner </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, September 18 (Xinhua) -- Piracy in Hong Kong is now
under control as the sale of pirated compact discs in many
notorious shopping arcades has been shrinking sharply.
</P>
<P>
John Tsang Chun-wah, commissioner of customs and excise, made
this remarks at his "Letter from Hong Kong" broadcast on Radio
Television Hong Kong Saturday morning.
</P>
<P>
The customs had allocated a great deal of resources to this
area of work, he said, adding that the department had the largest
dedicated professional enforcement team in the world to tackle the
piracy problem.
</P>
<P>
"This reflects our strong commitment and determination to wipe
out the illicit business," Tsang stressed.
</P>
<P>
Regarding the fight against the retail sale of pirated goods, a
185-member Special Task Force was set up in late June this year to
combat the sale of pirated compact discs at street level.
</P>
<P>
"In addition, we have also maintained a close liaison with the
police. Intelligence is exchanged regularly and joint operations
against notorious shopping centers and shops on the streets are
mounted periodically," he noted.
</P>
<P>
To tackle the problem, he said the customs had redirected the
enforcement strategy of the Intellectual Property Investigation
Bureau aiming at high-level piracy activities so as to track down
the source of pirated compact discs by taking proactive actions at
the manufacturing, storage and import or export levels.
</P>
<P>
Tsang said the move had been enhancing the effectiveness of
their enforcement actions.
</P>
<P>
He also disclosed that intelligence suggested that after the
recent series of vigorous enforcement actions, many copyright
pirates had moved their illicit business to neighboring
territories.
</P>
<P>
In order to further strengthen the scope of Customs'
enforcement, he went on, the government was considering the
introduction of other new legislation.
</P>
<P>
Tsang said like many other advanced places in the world, piracy
in Hong Kong had become a social problem, which could not be
solved merely by legislative and enforcement means.
</P>
<P>
"Tough customs is only a law enforcement agency, we have
recently been working with other government departments and the
industry to heighten public awareness of the need to protect
intellectual property rights," he added.

<HEADLINE> HK Strives for Quality Assurance in Schools </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, September 18 (Xinhua) -- The schools, the community
and the Education Department of Hong Kong were called Saturday to
concert their efforts to achieve the target of providing quality
education.
</P>
<P>
The remark came at a ceremony to grant certificates of
appreciation to 18 seconded school heads and teachers and 39 lay
members in recognition of their contribution to the Quality
Assurance Inspection (QAI).
</P>
<P>
The Education Department has been adopting a whole school
approach to school inspection, the QAI, since the 1997/98 school
year.
</P>
<P>
The QAI involves several domains of school education, such as
management and organization, teaching and learning, school ethos
and support for students.
</P>
<P>
In addition to professional staff from the ED, experienced
front-line educators and lay members are invited to participate in
the QAI team.
</P>
<P>
Addressing Saturday's ceremony, Fanny Law, director of
education, stressed that the participation of the front-line
educators and lay members was important to the success of QAI.
</P>
<P>
"Now that 19 per cent of the government's annual expenditure is
invested on education and the public is increasingly concerned
over the effectiveness of school education, it is imperative for
us to develop a thorough mechanism of quality assurance which
encourages accountability," she said.
</P>
<P>
Also officiating at the ceremony, William Lo, chairman of the
Advisory Committee on QAI, reported on the latest development of
the QAI.
</P>
<P>
Ever since its implementation, responses from the schools
inspected have been generally positive.
</P>
<P>
Schools are able to identify their strengths and possible areas
for improvement by participating in the highly transparent QAI
exercise. They can eventually engage themselves successfully in
self-evaluation and self-improvement.
</P>
<P>
"Experience sharing and dissemination of good practice among
schools, encouraging school self-evaluation and identifying areas
of school improvement would be the main focus for this year's
training and publicity activities," Lo said.
</P>
<P>
He noted that the Education Department would lay emphasis on
offering post-inspection support and guidance to schools that need
improvement.
</P>
<P>
The Education Department has collated the information on the
performances of 46 schools inspected in the 1998/1999 school year
and produced an annual summary report on QAI for schools'
reference.

CANBERRA, September 18 (Xinhua) -- Officials of the United
Nations Saturday stepped up the air delivery of emergency food to
displaced people in East Timor.
</P>
<P>
U.N. official David Wimhurst said in the northern Australian
city of Darwin that the U.N. planned to conduct two more flights,
dropping 20 tons of food to two areas outside the East Timor
capital Dili, following Friday's two flights over the same region.
</P>
<P>
Wimhurst said the U.N. World Food Program was also bringing in
a specially equipped aircraft from South Africa to conduct the
food drops that so far have been performed by Royal Australian Air
Force (RAAF) C-130 transport aircraft.
</P>
<P>
He said the U.N. planned to use the special aircraft for high
altitude "snow-dropping" of individual 200-gram packets of
high-protein biscuits.
</P>
<P>
Two RAAF aircraft Friday delivered 20 tons of rice to three
different areas of East Timor.
</P>
<P>
Wimhurst said the humanitarian situation in certain areas of
East Timor remained serious and the air dropping of food was only
a temporary solution until proper food deliveries could be
arranged on the ground.

BEIRUT, September 18 (Xinhua) -- Lebanon's highest Muslim
clerics have denounced a planned Walt Disney Co. exhibit in the
United States depicting Jerusalem as Israel's capital, calling on
Muslims and Arabs to boycott the company's products.
</P>
<P>
"This criminal Zionist Jewish firm is holding an exhibition to

Shamseddine, head of the Higher Shiite Council, as saying.
</P>
<P>
The country's Shiite spiritual leader called on the media to
show statistics throughout the week revealing the money Walt
Disney earns from Arabs and Muslims.

"This is not millions of dollars but billions, from small toys
to advertisements and cartoons. This company has firms and shops
in every Arab city," Shamseddine said.
</P>
<P>
The Grand Mufti Sheikh Mohammed Rashid Qabbani, the country's
Sunni spiritual leaer, echoed the sentiment, calling on "Arabs and
Muslims to boycott all industrial and commercial institutions
which advertise the theme: Jerusalem, Israel's capital.

15-month millennium celebration at the company's Florida theme
park on September 30, was designed to "acknowledge and honor the
people of Israel."

<HEADLINE> Ugandan President Writes to Rwanda Over Clashes in </HEADLINE>

Congo
</P>
<P>
KAMPALA, September 18 (Xinhua) -- Ugandan President Yoweri
Museveni has sent a formal message to Rwanda stating Uganda's
stand on the probe report of the recent clashes between the two
countries' troops in Kisangani in the Democratic Republic of the
Congo (DRC).
</P>
<P>
He is expecting a formal response to the report from Kigali,
Saturday's New Vision quoted security sources as saying.
</P>
<P>
After the two countries' responses have been considered, the
two neighbors will agree on a position on the probe report, an
official attending a security meeting at State House was quoted
as saying Friday.
</P>
<P>
The report said that Museveni has been angry with Rwandan Vice
 President and Minister of Defense Paul Kagame following the
release of the probe report on the August 14-17 clashes in which
both sides sustained heavy losses.
</P>
<P>
Museveni told the six-hour meeting Friday that he had advised
Kagame not to go public with the report compiled by Uganda Army
Commander Jeje Odongo and his Rwandan counterpart Kayumba
Nyamuswa.
</P>
<P>
Press reports here said that Kagame spilled the secrets of the
report while addressing the Rwandese National Assembly Thursday,
saying that Uganda was "100 percent responsible" for inciting the
fighting.
</P>
<P>
Uganda's Army High Command has rejected the probe report,
citing it is biased and inconclusive and recommended setting up a
new inquiry team to expose the real causes of shoot-out in the
DRC.
</P>
<P>
It is reported that both parties have downplayed their losses
and accused each other of provoking the four-day exchange of fire
in the third largest city in the DRC.

<HEADLINE> Warriors Center Dampier Undergoes Knee Surgery </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, September 17 (Xinhua) -- Already undermanned in the
middle, the Golden State Warriors likely will be without center
Erick Dampier for the start of the training camp.
</P>
<P>
The team announced on Friday that Dampier underwent successful
arthroscopic surgery on his left knee on Thursday to repair torn
cartilage, the lateral meniscus under the kneecap.
</P>
<P>
Dampier, who signed a multi-year contract in the offseason to
remain with the Warriors, suffered the injury during a recent
workout in Mississippi. Dampier is slated to start rehabilitation
immediately.
</P>
<P>
The 25-year-old will wear a brace for two weeks, at which time
he will begin a strength and conditioning program and be re-
evaluated periodically. Training camp is scheduled to start in
early October.
</P>
<P>
Acquired from Indiana in 1997, Dampier has averaged 10.7 points
and 8.3 rebounds per game in two season with the Warriors.
</P>
<P>
If Dampier is sidelined for an extended period of time, Adonal
Foyle likely would fill in at center. In two years with Warriors,
Foyle, a 1997 first-round pick, has averaged just 2.9 points per
contest.

<HEADLINE> Top Seed Wang Nan Bumped out at China Grand Prix </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GUILIN, China, September 18 (Xinhua) -- World number one women'
s paddler Wang Nan was bumped out of the '99 China Grand Prix
Table Tennis Championships final by Chinese-born German Qianghong
Gotsch here on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
The 20-year-old Chinese attacking player, who crowned herself
as the new queen of the sport in last month's world champoinships
at Eindhoven, the Netherlands, fell to a defensively-minded Gotsch
15-21, 21-17, 13-21, 12-21 in one of the semi-finals on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
Wang's perishment completed an anticlimax to the three-day ITTF
Pro-Tour event which closes this afternoon after top two men's
singles players, Liu Guoliang and Ma Lin, both from China, made a
premature exit one after another in Friday's competitions.
</P>
<P>
"Wang had a major injury problem with her left arm," said Lu
Yuansheng, head coach of the Chinese women's team. "And that cost
her, especially when tackling a top defensive player like He
Qianghong (as she was formerly known)."
</P>
<P>
It's the first time Wang, whose European shakehand style is
normally vunerable against defensive players, and the former
Chinese paddler faced off each other, Lu revealt.
</P>
<P>
Post-world championships fatigue also played a role in her
premature failure, Lu said.
</P>
<P>
"You'll find it hard to motivate yourself after a major triumph
in the world championships. You just can't work up yourself under
less pressure like competing such tournament," Lu said.
</P>
<P>
Wang threw away the first set in a blink before taking the
second 21-17, but Gotsch spiked up her defensive play with some
fast-attacking flavor in the following two sets, to which the
defending champion failed to respond.
</P>
<P>
As the game wore on, Wang apparently lost her fighting spirits
in a battle of patience, spurting out unforced errors and always
being the losing end of the lengthy rallies.
</P>
<P>
A gallant Gotsch, refusing to be intimidated by Wang's
trademark powerful forehand smashes and a full house of partisan
crowd, pumped her fists after finally bring down the world
champion to size.
</P>
<P>
The veteran player, ranked seventh in the ITTF world rankings,
will have to battle against another Chinese opposition in the
shape of Li Ju, who thrashed her teammate Li Nan 21-14, 21-17, 21-
16 in the other semi-final.

started with Genghis Khan, who founded ancient Mongolia and whose
grandson Kublai Khan established the Yuan Dynasty (1271-1368).
When he is now compiling books on local history, Qi likes to grow
flowers, vegetables and fruit trees in his small courtyard of a
bungalow in the city of Dongsheng, in the southwest part of the
Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region.
</P>
<P>
He resigned from the vice-chairmanship of north China's Inner
Mongolia Autonomous Regional Committee of the Chinese People's
Political Consultative Conference (CPPCC) in 1998.
</P>
<P>
When he was just 16, Qi helped his grandfather in political
affairs, and he ascended the throne four months before New China
was founded on October 1, 1949.
</P>
<P>
"I was in great fear at that time for I didn't know what the
central government would do to a feudal prince," he said.

<HEADLINE> Kenya to Sack Corrupt Officials </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, September 18 (Xinhua) -- Instant Dismissal awaits
corrupt civil servants, Kenya's Head of Civil Service Richard
Leaky has warned.
</P>
<P>
East African Standard newspaper Saturday quoted Leakey as
saying that corruption was a cancer that must be eliminated at all
costs and the vice had pushed the country into doldrums.
</P>
<P>
Civil service cutback will be implemented within the next three
months and steps are being taken to ensure staff are disciplined
and accountable to the public, Leakey said at an anti-corruption
workshop.
</P>
<P>
Corruption has undermined efficiency and ruined Kenya's
relationship with the outside world especially the donor
community, he said.
</P>
<P>
He decried the level of corruption in Kenya by narrating how a
resident in central Kenya's Rift Valley Province had to labor in
order to secure a birth certificate for his new-born child.
</P>
<P>
Richard Leaky was appointed to head of civil service in July as
part of economic recovery plan of Kenyan President Daniel Arap
Moi.
</P>
<P>
Kenya's economy has been in decline since the International
Monetary Fund suspended a 205 million U.S. dollars loan to Kenya
in protest at corruption in the east African country in 1997.

He turned his allegiance to the Chinese Communist Party in
August 1949, and thought that he would be permitted to earn a
living as a teacher. To his surprise, he was elected a banner head
in March 1950.
</P>
<P>
"I became a prince again. However, this time it was quite
different from before. I had no servants and what I needed to do
then was to serve the residents in my banner," said he.
</P>
<P>
He then was promoted to vice chairman of the Ih Ju League in
southwest Inner Mongolia in July 1956, a position he had held
until the chaotic Cultural Revolution started in 1966.
</P>
<P>
He spent a lot of time studying the daily lives of the
residents during his tenure as vice chairman of the Ih Ju League.
And in 1979, he was appointed vice chairman of the Inner Mongolia
Autonomous Regional Committee of the CPPCC.
</P>
<P>
"Great changes have taken place in my country in the past fifty
years. Now, I can either take cars or airplanes. The best
transportation for me when I was a prince was just a horse," he
said.
</P>
<P>
Up to now, he has compiled 30 books on the local history based
on what he has learned at work and his own observations.
</P>
<P>
"What I have experienced convinced me that it is the wise
policies of the Central Government on ethnic minorities, the
regional autonomy policy in particular, that have led to political
stability and harmony among the ethnic groups, as it has taken
into consideration every ethnic group's interests," he said.
</P>
<P>
He is now working on his autobiography called "the Last Prince
in China," which compares his experiences as a prince and a
government official in New China.

PRAGUE, September 17 (Xinhua) -- Slovakian President Rudolf
Schuster and his visiting Czech counterpart Vaclav Havel said at a
joint press conference on Friday that the cold period between the
two countries has come to an end and a new era of cooperation has
begun.
</P>
<P>
They said there are no major political or ethnic problems
remaining unsolved.
</P>
<P>
Czech President Havel began his first ever, two-day state visit
to Slovakia on Friday and has held talks with the Slovakian
president in Bratislava, capital of Slovakia.
</P>
<P>
The two presidents revealed that the two countries have largely
reached agreement on property division, with only a few technical
problems requiring further discussions.
</P>
<P>
The agreement is expected to be signed by the prime ministers
of the two countries within this year, according to them.

<HEADLINE> Thai Importers Suffer Big Blow From Yen's Rise </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, September 18 (Xinhua) -- Thai importers are suffering
a double blow from the yen's rapid rise and the baht's weakness
against the greenback, The Nation reported Saturday.
</P>
<P>
The newspaper quoted the latest report of the Thai Farmers
Research Center that imports will become more expensive and
inflation was likely to rise significantly, given that Japan is
the largest source of Thai imports with a yearly average of over
10 billion U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
Thailand mainly imports capital items, semi-finished goods and
raw materials, such as machinery and equipment, currency and
steel, chemical products and automobiles from Japan.
</P>
<P>
The center said the higher yen value will result in higher
import costs. Given the rising price of oil, inflation will soon
go up very fast.
</P>
<P>
The Thai currency's weakness will also give importers a harder
time as the price of their imported goods will jump in line with
the falling baht value.
</P>
<P>
On the contrary, Thai exporters are reaping a windfall from the
higher yen value, which jumped to 103.55 yen against the U.S.
dollar on September 15, giving exporters greater competitiveness.
</P>
<P>
Thai products will become much cheaper in yen terms, which will
bolster the prospects for the country's overall export
performance.
</P>
<P>
The center also said yen's rise will lead to an ever-larger
Thai trade deficit with Japan. The gap gets wider each year and
tends to rise in line with a stronger yen.
</P>
<P>
In addition, the center predicted that external debts of
Thailand would rise dramatically. Yen-denominated loans now
account for over 33 percent of all external debts in Thailand.
</P>
<P>
Moreover, the research house said that the stronger yen would
lead to a higher capital inflow from Japan and that more Japanese
investors were likely to relocate to other Asian economies,
including Thailand.

<HEADLINE> Bangladeshi Experts oppose Idea of Community Clinics </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DHAKA, September18 -- The government plans to set up 13,500
community clinics by 2003 for delivery of Essential Service
Package (ESP), but many experts oppose the idea.
</P>
<P>
ESP is a major component of the fifth five-year health sector
reform program known as Health and Population Sector Program
(HPSP).
</P>
<P>
The concept of Community Clinic has bee adopted in the HPSP to
ensure health and family planning services at grassroots level and
easy access to healthcare services. One clinic costing about Taka
200,000 ( around 4000 U.S. Dollars) would be set up for every 6000
rural people.
</P>
<P>
However, setting up of community clinics to provide healthcare
is opposed by many experts, according to a report published by the
local newspaper " The Daily Star" on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
Utilization of healthcare facility at present is less than 40
percent which is considered "Quite poor", they mentioned.
</P>
<P>
The government over the years established some health
complexes, health sub-centers at union level and subsequently set
up more and more health centers. but unfortunately, it proved to
be of little help for the targeted population, they said, adding
the existing healthcare facilities must be made more efficient
before undertaking any new venture for healthcare facility.

<HEADLINE> KLA to Complete Disarmament Process: KFOR </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BELGRADE, September 17 (Xinhua) -- NATO peacekeepers in Kosovo
(KFOR) said Friday that the Kosovo Liberation Army (KLA) will
complete its disarmament process by the midnight of Saturday.
</P>
<P>
In a statement issued in Kosovo's capital of Pristina, the KFOR
said that the KLA has so far surrendered more than 10,000 pieces
of weapons, and those they are keeping to protect their barracks
will be turned to the peacekeepers on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
After Saturday, the KLA members could wear their uniforms only
in the areas controlled by the KFOR. A "Kosovo Corps" consisting
of 5,000 people will be established after the KLA is disarmed,
said the statement.
</P>
<P>
However, the Yugoslav press said that the United Nations has
never authorized the international peacekeepers in Kosovo to set
up such a corps, and that what they are intending to do is to
legalize the status of the ethnic Albanian rebels.
</P>
<P>
Under Resolution 1244 of the UN, Saturday is the deadline for
the KLA's disarmament.
</P>
<P>
Yugoslavia, which insists that the KLA be completely disarmed
and disbanded, has said the disarmament of the Kosovo Liberation
Army (KLA) was a farce because the rebel group was hiding its best
weapons in Albania, Macedonia and secret storage spots inside
Kosovo, the Yugoslav province.
</P>
<P>
The statement came as Vladislav Jovanovic, charge d'affaires of
the Yugoslav Mission to the United Nations, was speaking at a
press conference here.
</P>
<P>
"They surrender what is old-fashioned, vintage and not of much
importance," he said. "But what is really modern and efficient
they conceal."
</P>
<P>
The senior Yugoslav diplomat accused NATO and the United
Nations of backing the KLA and its goal of an independent Kosovo,
and of encouraging KLA fighters to join the police, the civilian
administration of towns and villages, and a new national guard.
</P>
<P>
This has undermined a United Nations resolution and violated
the sovereignty and territorial integrity of Yugoslavia, he said.
</P>
<P>
Security Council Resolution 1244, adopted on June 10, demands
that every State Member and the world body fully respect the
sovereignty and territorial integrity of the Federal Republic of
Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
Russia insists on the complete disbanding and demilitarization
of the rebel army and sees the new force as part of international
attempts to weaken the hold on the province of its traditional
ally, Serbia, a Yugoslav republic.

<HEADLINE> Hurricane Floyd Takes Last Bite in Eastern Canada </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
OTTAWA, September 17 (Xinhua) -- Hurricane Floyd took one last
bite in eastern Canada, leaving tens of thousands of people
without power Friday.
</P>
<P>
Up to 40,000 people in Quebec are rendered out of power in
addition to another 1,300 people plunged into blackout in the
Atlantic provinces of New Brunswick and Nova Scotia.
</P>
<P>
The CTV reported damage caused by the downgrading Floyd, which
was still powerful enough to knock down trees, power lines and
houses in Halifax, Nova Scotia.
</P>
<P>
The television also reported minor injuries caused by traffic
accidents in the storm, which brought 13 centimeters of rain to
some areas, with strong winds moving at 104 kilometers an hour at
its worst.
</P>
<P>
Maritime Canada braced for the advent of the storm as early as
Wednesday, when schools were closed in the southern part of Nova
Scotia and water surfers were warned to stay away from the beach,
where waves were witnessed surging five to seven meters high ahead
of the storm.
</P>
<P>
Hurricane Floyd has caused at least 19 deaths and millions of
dollars in damage since it first pounded the Bahamas Tuesday with
winds blowing at 250 kilometers an hour.
</P>
<P>
Over 3 million Americans were reported fleeing their homes when
the storm landed late Tuesday in Florida and then moved across
Georgia, Carolinas, Virginia, Maryland, New Jersey, New York and
Washington.

<HEADLINE> Hoya, Trinidad to Square off in Welterweight Blockbuster </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, September 17 (Xinhua) -- The biggest non-
heavyweight fight in more than a decade takes place Saturday night
in Las Vegas when Oscar de la Hoya, the unbeaten WBC champion,
squares off with Felix Trinidad, the undefeated IBF titleholder.
</P>
<P>
De la Hoya, "the Golden Boy" (31-0, 25 KOs), is the sport's
most marketable commodity and the linchpin of HBO's boxing empire.
He has crossover appeal and, at 26, is still in his prime.
</P>
<P>
"I want to knock him out for my fans," de la Hoya said. "I
know I can do it. I'm very prepared for this fight. May the best
man win."
</P>
<P>
The 26-year-old Trinidad (35-0, 30 KOs), a Puerto Rican who
speaks little English, has been protected from the media by his
father and trainer, Felix Sr., who also was a boxer. Trinidad's
allure is stunning knockout power that is offset by a suspect chin.
</P>
<P>
"I will knock de la Hoya out," Trinidad said through an
interpreter. "That's the only way I can win and I know he can't
handle my power. Remember, you heard it here first."
</P>
<P>
The fight has drawn incredible interest from fight fans who see
the bout as possibly the first in a classic series. Most compare
the matchup to the first Sugar Ray Leonard-Thomas Hearns bout in
1981.
</P>
<P>
"He is like Tommy Hearns in this match, bigger, a stronger
puncher with great power in both hands," de la Hoya said. "I'm
kind of like Sugar Ray, because I can box and punch. Like Hearns
and Leonard, our styles are different, and that will make for a
very exciting match."
</P>
<P>
Oddsmakers agree on the competitiveness of the fight, with de
la Hoya a slight 6-5 favorite. De la Hoya also has the edge in
purse, receiving at least 15 million U.S. dollars while Trinidad
gets $10 million.
</P>
<P>
The bout is expected to be the biggest grossing non-heavyweight
fight of all time and among the top five events in pay-per-view
history. When de la Hoya fought Pernell Whitaker in April 1997,
the bout recorded 800,000 buys. At 49.95 U.S. dollars, this fight
should generate more than 40 million U.S. dollars in PPV revenue.
</P>
<P>
"I am ready to get in the ring and show that there can only be
one undefeated champion, and it's going to be me," de la Hoya said.
</P>
<P>
"I know he will get the majority of the fans that night,"
Trinidad added. "It doesn't matter. It will be just him and me in
the ring."
</P>
<P>
De la Hoya is 20-0 in title fights while Trinidad has made 14
successful defense.

<HEADLINE> NBA Board Approves Rules Changes Geared Toward Offense </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, September 17 (Xinhua) -- The NBA went back to the
future on Saturday as its Board of Governors approved rules
changes that hopefully will reduce rough play and improve
offensive flow, an element that has eroded during the 1990s.
</P>
<P>
The rules modifications were recommended in June by a special
committee and were used during summer league games. They will be
implemented in the 1999-2000 season.
</P>
<P>
"These rules will help us fine-tune and improve the look and
flow of our game," NBA senior vice president of basketball
operations Rod Thorn said. "We realize there will probably be a
transitional period for everyone involved to get used to the
changes, but we believe that they will improve the game."
</P>
<P>
Scoring dropped for the 10th straight year last season to 91.6
points per game, four points lower than the 1997-98 season and the
lowest averages since the inception of the shot clock in 1954.
The NBA Finals between the San Antonio Spurs and New York Knicks
produced the two lowest five-game point totals in history.
</P>
<P>
The two biggest changes involved a reduction in hand-checking
and the 24-second clock, which will not be reset or reset to just
14 seconds after certain violations.
</P>
<P>
A defender no longer will be allowed to make contact with his
hands or forearms on an offensive player above the foul line
extended. Quick players such as Philadelphia 76ers guard Allen
Iverson were being slowed by physical play ranging from a hand on
the hip to being shoved off course.
</P>
<P>
On non-shooting fouls, illegal defense warnings and kicked or
punched balls, the shot clock will not be reset if already above
14 seconds and will be reset to 14 seconds if below 14 seconds.
</P>
<P>
The belief is that extra possessions will be generated by these
new guidelines. Previously, the shot clock always was reset to 24
seconds in those situations.
</P>
<P>
The board also approved a five-second rule which forces a
player to shoot, pass or pick up his dribble if he begins
dribbling with his back toward the basket below the foul line
extended.
</P>
<P>
This rule would prevent players such as Houton Rockets forward
Charles Barkley and Indiana Pacers guard Mark Jackson from backing
in opponents and bringing team play to a grinding halt.
</P>
<P>
Finally, defenders will be allowed to leave the men and chase
the ball or pressure another offensive player as long as they are
on the strong side of the court.
</P>
<P>
The 16-member committee was made up of players, coaches,
general managers and owners. NBA commissioner David Stern and
deputy commissioner Russ Granik sat in on the meetings and
supervisor of officials Ed Rush made a video presentation that
showed the increase in physical play and the incremental
deterioration of offensive flow.
</P>
<P>
In 1989, the league scoring average was 109 points per game.
It dipped below 100 points per game in the 1995-96 season and only
one team -- the Sacramento Kings -- averaged triple figures last
season.
</P>
<P>
The new rules should lead to an increase in fouls as players
get acclimated. In June, Thorn maintained the NBA referees would
call games as they were instructed -- a serious bone of contention
in baseball this season.

<HEADLINE> U.S. "Dream Team" to Face Russia for Fed Cup Title </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, September 17 (Xinhua) -- A formidable United States
team featuring four of the top five players in the world will be a
heavy favorite against Russia when the two nations meet for the
Federation Cup title, beginning Saturday.
</P>
<P>
The best-of-five series will take place at Stanford University
on the hardcourt surface in California as the U.S. looks to extend
its own record of 15 Fed Cup titles.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. squad will be comprised of reigning U.S. Open champion
Serena Williams, Wimbledon champion Lindsay Davenport, Serena's
older sister and world No. 3 Venus and world No. 5 Monica Seles.
</P>
<P>
Serena Williams beat Seles in the U.S. Open quarter-finals and
Davenport in the semi-finals before upsetting top-ranked Martina
Hingis of Switzerland to win her first Grand Slam singles title.
The 17-year-old moved up to a career-high No. 4 in the WTA Tour
rankings with her performance in New York.
</P>
<P>
Substituting for an injured Seles in the Fed Cup semi-finals
against Italy, Serena provided the clinching win in the 4-1 series
victory. Making their Fed Cup debut, the Williams sisters
combined for all four victories.
</P>
<P>
Davenport, 23, came up short in her bid to defend her U.S. Open
title, but remained at No. 2 in the world.
</P>
<P>
The 19-year-old Venus Williams lost to Hingis in the U.S. Open
semi-finals, but she teamed with Serena to win the doubles title
and most likely will be the doubles tandem this weekend.
</P>
<P>
A nine-time Grand Slam champion, Seles is the oldest player on
the team at 25. She owns a 11-1 record in Fed Cup competition.
</P>
<P>
Led by Elena Likhovtseva and Tatiana Panova, Russia defeated
Slovakia 3-2 in the semifinals after upsetting a strong French
team in the opening round. Likhovtseva and Panova will be joined
by Elena Dementieva and Elena Makarova for the final.
</P>
<P>
Russia has never won a Fed Cup title, but reached the final in
1988 and 1990. This will be the fourth meeting between the two
nations, and the United States has won all three previous meetings.

<P>
BRASILIA, September 17 (Xinhua) -- Brazilian Foreign Minister
Luiz Felipe Lampreia has refused to meet with a representative
from the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia (FARC), who is
visiting Brazil to seek official support.
</P>
<P>
According to the "Journal do Brazil" Friday, the FARC
representative, identified only as "Ramirez," said the guerrillas
desire to open a representative office in Brasilia, and want the
Brazilian government to recognize them as "a belligerent force."
</P>
<P>
Without Brazilian support, Ramirez said, the United States
lacks excuses for military intervention against FARC, the biggest
guerrilla group in the western hemisphere.
</P>
<P>
Ramirez also said the FARC wants a meeting between its top
leader, Manuel Marulanda Velez, and Brazilian President Fernando
Henrique Cardoso, in order to deny the United States' claim that
FARC is involved in drug-trafficking.
</P>
<P>
The Venezuelan and Brazilian governments have declared that
they are opposed to U.S. military intervention against Colombia.

<HEADLINE> Indonesia Seriously Preparing 2001 SEA Games, Says Official </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, September 18 (Xinhua) -- Indonesia is seriously
preparing its athletes to regain the overall title in the 21st
Southeast Asian (SEA) Games in Kuala Lumpur in 2001 by starting
intensive discussions with 36 sports organizations on their
training programs.
</P>
<P>
The National Sports Council (KONI) official in charge of
athletes development Mochammad Hindarto said that KONI asked the
organizations to decide the number of athletes and coaches for the
games and handed over training guidelines.
</P>
<P>
"All organizations must make details of the guidelines in their
training programs. We will discuss the programs in a coordination
meeting in Puncak, West Java, on September 27. The discussion
will be attended by officials from KONI's provincial chapters, the
ministry of education and culture and sports experts," he said.
</P>
<P>
Hindarto said the training programs would link with the
programs for the 2002 Asian Games in Pusan, South Korea. KONI has
sent a proposal on the programs to the state minister of youth
affairs and sports office requesting financial support for two
years training programs starting this year.
</P>
<P>
However, Hindarto declined to mention the budget figure.
</P>
<P>
He hoped the state ministry's office would respond, at the
latest, in November.
</P>
<P>
"If they don't respond in November, KONI will stage courses for
coaches, who are grooming athletes for the 2000 National Games.
We'll provide them with skills to prepare their athletes better
for the 2001 SEA Games," he was quoted by The Jakarta Post's
Saturday issue as saying.
</P>
<P>
KONI's Chairman Wismoyo Arismunandar urged the All-Indonesian
Soccer Federation (PSSI) to arrange a better training program to
win the most prestigious gold medal in the 2001 Games.
</P>
<P>
"Indonesia has failed to win the gold medal since the 1991 SEA
Games. KONI urges PSSI to win the gold medal as well as to pursue
the overall title in 2001," said Nugraha Besoes, PSSI secretary
general,after meeting Wismoyo to report on the PSSI's national
congress next week.

<HEADLINE> Indonesian Sports Minister Against Sending Athletes </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, September 18 (Xinhua) -- Indonesian Minister of Sports
and Youth Affairs Agung Laksono said he would be against sending a
sporting delegation to 2000 Olympic Games in Sydney, "if Australia
carries on with its unfriendly attitude towards Indonesia".
</P>
<P>
The minister said that the political ties between Indonesia and
Australia were experiencing the biggest decline due to the
unfriendly statements by Australian officials over the East Timor
crisis.
</P>
<P>
"If the tension goes from bad to worse, what do we send
athletes to Australia for? Athletes are the nation's ambassadors.
What do we send the ambassadors for, to a country which looks
arrogant and less amicable," he was quoted by The Indonesian
Observer Saturday as saying.
</P>
<P>
The Indonesian government on Thursday canceled a security pact
with Australia, denouncing Australia's attitude and actions on the
East Timor issue.
</P>
<P>
Anti-Australia sentiment has grown stronger all over Indonesia
with demonstrators taking to the streets everyday slamming
Australia.
</P>
<P>
Agung said: "Given the prevalent attitude of Australia, the
Indonesian government must heed the people's sentiments. If the
ties worsen and if Australia is persistent in its arrogant
attitude and remains repugnant to us. Well, what's the use of
participating in the Olympics?"
</P>
<P>
However, he said that preparations, including the campaign to
win places at Sydney Olympics through qualifications, were and
would be going ahead as planned.
</P>
<P>
Indonesia has been assured of participation in Sydney in
athletics, badminton, archery, swimming, surfing and taekwondo,
whilst weightlifting, boxing and tennis are the only other three
disciplines in which Indonesian athletes have better prospects for
qualifying.

<HEADLINE> Interview: Laos Promotes Rice Production, Multilateral Trade to Save Crisis-Hit Economy: Lao FM </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, September 18 (Xinhua) -- Laos has taken various
measures to alleviate the impact of the financial crisis on the
already weak economy, Lao Deputy Prime Minister and Foreign
Minister Somsawat Lengsavad told Xinhua in an interview in the Lao
capital of Vientiane recently.
</P>
<P>
When introducing the current economic situation of one of the
least developed countries in the world, the minister said that the
financial crisis took a heavy toll of the Lao economy.
</P>
<P>
He admitted that his country's economy has shown signs of
serious problems even before the crisis, which broke out in
mid-1997 from its southern neighbor Thailand.
</P>
<P>
"The domestic production could not meet the demand of the
people, while the infrastructure of the country is lagging far
behind due to years of war," the minister said.
</P>
<P>
He particularly mentioned the infrastructure construction of
the country, saying that it could not be sustained due to the
budget deficit.
</P>
<P>
The country's revenue stands at more than 200 million U.S.
dollars, while the deficit is at 100 million dollars, accounting
for nearly 50 percent of the budget.
</P>
<P>
The country's infrastructure has been mainly dependent on
foreign aid, he said.
</P>
<P>
As for Laos' foreign trade, Somsawat said that too much
imports, especially imports from Thailand, is the major problem
his country, the only landlocked state in southeast Asia, is
facing.
</P>
<P>
In Vientiane, which borders Thailand by the Mekong river, about
70 percent of the goods sold in local stores are from the opposite
side of the river.
</P>
<P>
Some 80 percent of Laos' external trade are conducted with
Thailand, which made the Lao economy vulnerable to any turmoil in
Thailand, the minister said.
</P>
<P>
As a result, the country was plunged into a deeper mire than
its neighbor after the latter devalued its currency, the baht, in
July 1997.
</P>
<P>
The Lao currency, the kip, has been depreciated to 9,400-9,700
kips against the U.S. dollar now from 920 kips to the greenback in
July 1997.
</P>
<P>
The fluctuation of the kip further dampened the economic
situation as foreign investors shunned the country, the minister
said.
</P>
<P>
To alleviate the impact of the crisis, the Lao government has
taken a series of measures, among which the increase of rice
production has been greatly highlighted.
</P>
<P>
The country has been focusing on the expansion of the planting
of double-harvest rice to feed its people, the minister said.
</P>
<P>
In 1991, the country had only 25,000 hectares of such rice,
while in 1997-1998 season, the area for the rice had increased by
28,000 hectares to 53,000 hectares, and in 1998-1999 season, the
area increased to 87,000 hectares.
</P>
<P>
It is expected that in the upcoming 1999-2000 season,
double-harvest rice will be planted in at least 100,000 hectares
of land in Laos.
</P>
<P>
"When there is no problem feeding the people, there will be no
need to import so many goods," the minister said.
</P>
<P>
Laos is also trying to avoid being too dependent on Thailand in
trade by promoting trade with other neighbors like Vietnam and
China.
</P>
<P>
As part of the efforts to lure foreign investment, the country
worked out a foreign investment management act, which was amended
in 1997 and passed by the parliament later.
</P>
<P>
The act has helped to create a friendly investment environment.
As a result, more than 30 countries and regions have come to Laos
for investment with contract amount totaling six billion dollars.
</P>
<P>
"The financial crisis has given Laos a lesson, making the
country realize the importance of being independent," the minister
said.
</P>
<P>
The country now plans to make full use of its own resources,
trade with more countries and attract more foreign investment so
as to bring the country out of the crisis, he said.

<HEADLINE> Sri Lanka Launches Massive Electricity Program </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
COLOMBO, September 18 (Xinhua) -- Sri Lanka has launched a
9.665 billion rupees (138.2 million U.S. dollars) program with
foreign loans to augment its electricity transmission system in a
bid to meet the increasing power demand, officials said Saturday.
</P>
<P>
The program is assisted by Credit Institute of Restoration and
Reconstruction (KFW) of Germany, the World Bank, the Overseas
Economic Cooperation Fund (OECF) of Japan, the Norwegian
government and the Asian Development Bank (ADB) in the form of
soft loans, said a spokesman for the Ministry of Power.
</P>
<P>
He said the KFW would provide 765 million rupees (11 million
dollars) to establish a new grid substation at Kelaniya and
rehabilitate another at Ratmalana, both in Colombo's suburbs.
</P>
<P>
The replacing of the grid substation at Kolonnawa with a new
one and the upgrading of the Pannipitiya grid substation, funded
by the World Bank with 2.7 billion rupees (38.6 million dollars),
will remedy the shortcomings in the supply of electricity in the
Colombo area by the year 2002, the spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
The installation of the new grid substations in Ratnapura and
Athurugiriya in central Sri Lanka at a cost of 3.4 billion rupees
(48.6 million dollars) assisted by the OECF of Japan will also
improve the electricity transmission system covered by them.
</P>
<P>
The proposed new grid substation in northern Vavuniya at a cost
of 300 million rupees (4.3 million dollars) with Norwegian
assistance will also enable the government to restore the power
supply to the Northern province in the first quarter of the year
2001.
</P>
<P>
The ministry is also working on a project to install 12 grid
substations at a cost of 2.5 billion rupees (35.7 million dollars)
with ADB assistance, the spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
About 55 percent of 18.5 million Sri Lankans have access to
electricity. The government has decided to observe 1999-2009 as a
decade of power development in a move to provide every household
with electricity.

<P>
Editor's note: The People's Republic of China celebrates its
50th founding anniversary this year and Xinhua will release 10
stories on key facts and figures on the nation's economic and
social developments over the last half century. This is the fourth
in the series.
</P>
<P>
BEIJING, September 18 (Xinhua) -- The lives of the Chinese
people have improved tremendously since the founding of the People
's Republic of China in 1949, especially since 1978, when the
country started its reform and opening policy. This is indicated
by the following facts and figures:
</P>
<P>
The average disposable income for China's urban residents was 5,
425 yuan in 1998, up 220 percent up from the 1978 level in real
terms.
</P>
<P>
From 1949 to 1998, annual cash income for China's rural
residents rose from 44 to 2,162 yuan, up 48-fold.
</P>
<P>
The actual spending of each Chinese was 2,973 yuan in 1998,
compared to 80 yuan in 1952.
</P>
<P>
China's private saving deposits reached 5,340.7 billion yuan in
1998, up by 6,200 times over that of 1952, and 254 times over 1978.
</P>
<P>
In 1998, food accounted for 45 percent of the total spending of
China's urban residents, and 53 percent of that of rural residents.
</P>
<P>
At the end of 1998, 68 percent of China's urban families lived
in flats, 74 percent of them had bathrooms or toilets in their own

<HEADLINE> Wang Junxia's Run in 1993 Worlds "Greatest Ever" </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, September 17 (Xinhua) -- The startling race of Chinese
woman long-distance runner Wang Junxia at the fourth world
championships in 1993 is rated as the greatest ever on the world
record books.
</P>
<P>
British statistician Howard Grubb, from Reading University,
compiled the 200 all-time bests in each track event from 100
meters up to marathons. He then compared the speeds of the
athletes at each distance and saw a smooth trend for both men and
women.
</P>
<P>
He identified the very best performances by spotting which
world records stuck out above the general trend.
</P>
<P>
By comparison, Grubb concluded that Wang's 10,000m run in
Stuttgart, Germany six years ago was the best world mark.
</P>
<P>
According to the statistician, the most remarkable performances
are as follows (compared to an average of 100%):
</P>
<P>
1. Wang Junxia -- 10,000m -- September 1993 -- 102%
</P>
<P>
2. Wang Junxia -- 3,000m -- September 1993 -- 101.5%
</P>
<P>
3. Haile Gebrselassie -- 10,000m -- June 1998 -- 101.1%
</P>
<P>
4. Michael Johnson -- 200m -- August 1996 -- 100.9%
</P>
<P>
In accordance with the analysis, the women's 5,000m record
should be the most vulnerable to attack, rating just 98.9% whilst
the men's event lying furthest below average is the 100m.
</P>
<P>
Maurice Green, the world's fastest man at 9.79 seconds over the
distance, should be aiming for 9.71 seconds to reach Grubb's
predicted world record.
</P>
<P>
However, Grubb acknowledges that some will disagree with his
approach. "The particular conditions of a race, if the weather
was hot or cold, if a pacemaker was used, could have an effect,"
he said.

<HEADLINE> Colombian Rebels Want Resumption of Dialog with Government </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SANTAFE DE BOGOTA, September 17 (Xinhua) -- Colombia's National
Liberation Army (ELN), the second largest rebel group in the
country, announced Friday that it would like to resume direct
peace talks with the government.
</P>
<P>
This message came from Thursday's meeting between an ELN leader
and business leaders in Caracas, which was aimed at breathing life
into stalled peace talks between the guerrilla group and the
Colombian government.
</P>
<P>
The meeting, initiated by Venezuelan President Hugo Chavez and
authorized by the Colombian government, was attended by business
leaders, Colombian Attorney General Jaime Bernal Cuellar and ELN
Central Committee delegate Pablo Beltran.
</P>
<P>
One of the business leaders, Sabas Pretelt, said that the peace
talks between the ELN and the government could be resumed even
before the release of some 56 hostages the ELN took during three
mass kidnappings in the first half of 1999.
</P>
<P>
The ELN will hope to seek an agreement with the government on
creating a buffer zone, similar to the one granted to the
Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia (FARC), the largest
guerrilla group in the country, Pretelt said.
</P>
<P>
Contacts between the government and the ELN broke off after the
rebel group staged two mass kidnappings involving a commercial
airliner and a church congregation in April and May.
</P>
<P>
The death toll of Colombia's civil war has exceeded 35,000 in
the last decade, as guerrillas, right-wing death squads and the U.
S.-trained army battle for control.

<HEADLINE> U.N. Delays Multinational Force Arrival in Dili: Indonesian Military </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, September 18 (Xinhua) -- The United Nations has
delayed the arrival of an advance team of the International Force
in East Timor (Interfet) in Dili, capital of East Timor, according
to the Indonesian Military (TNI).
</P>
<P>
"The transfer of mandate to restore peace and order in East
Timor from TNI to the multinational force remains hanging in the
balance. I've received a call from Cilangkap (TNI Headquarters)
that the advance team will not come by Saturday or early next
week," Maj. Gen. Kiki Syahnakri, head of the Restoration Operation
Command in East Timor, said Friday.
</P>
<P>
He said the fact that both TNI and the United Nations had yet
to agree on the cooperation scheme might have caused the delay.
</P>
<P>
He added that he also received a call from TNI Headquarters
that Interfet Commander Maj. Gen. Peter Cosgrove would not come to
Dili on Saturday as scheduled.
</P>
<P>
Cosgrove was scheduled to lead a 250-member advanced team,
which would include 65 British Gurkhas, to Dili on Saturday. The
first 2,000 of some 8,000 international soldiers were expected to
follow the advance team in a couple of days.
</P>
<P>
"Ideally, the transfer of military command should take place a
week after the main body of the U.N. multinational force sets foot
in East Timor," Kiki was quoted by The Jakarta Post Saturday as
saying.
</P>
<P>
Despite the delay, the withdrawal of TNI troops continued on
Friday.
</P>
<P>
TNI said in a statement on Friday that some 8,000 troops in
East Timor have left or were on their way out of the territory and
entering the border town of Atambua in the western half of Timor
island.
</P>
<P>
As of Thursday, there were one Marine unit and 12 Army
battalions in East Timor, as well as 8,000 police and 5,000
members of the local military command.
</P>
<P>
Kiki said his troops blocked off all access to Dili to prevent
pro-Jakarta militias from attacking the multinational force.
</P>
<P>
"We have set up a post in Tasitolu, west of Dili, where we
conduct a weapon search on everybody entering the capital," Kiki
added.

<HEADLINE> China to Regulate Foreign-Involved Surveying </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, September 18 (Xinhua) -- China will reinforce
management of foreign-involved surveying and mapping activities,
today's "China Daily" reports.
</P>
<P>
The paper cited Huang Yunkang, deputy director of the State
Bureau of Surveying and Mapping, as saying that according to
Chinese laws any foreigners who wants to conduct surveying and
mapping activities within China's borders and territorial waters
must report to the Chinese authorities.
</P>
<P>
The paper explains that in recent years some foreigners have
surveyed parts of the country without first reporting to the
Chinese authorities.
</P>
<P>
In a case, a foreign exploration team carried out surveying and
mapping of regions along the Great Wall without registering with
the State surveying and mapping administration department, the
paper reveals.
</P>
<P>
According to Huang, the activity of surveying and mapping is a
matter of national sovereignty and security.

PANAMA CITY, September 17 (Xinhua) -- Panama must get
politically and economically closer to the Central American region,
of which it is part geographically, to achieve a better economic
development, a Panamanian councilman said Friday.
</P>
<P>
Panamanian Councilman Julio Crespo said that if Panama links
itself to Central America more closely, this country will obtain a
bigger economic development and a solid political integration at a
Latin American level.
</P>
<P>
Crespo made this statement during a ceremony held here
commemorating the 178 years of the Central American countries
independence from the Spanish dominion, an event attended by high
ranking government officials and diplomatic corps.
</P>
<P>
The councilman said that Panama is an important link in that
geographical chain of Central American countries and that its
leaders must have among their goals to speed up the integration
that will permit them to share their economic and political
experiences.
</P>
<P>
Panama plays an important role, because of its geographical
position, in the development of commerce between North, Central
and South America, he said.

<HEADLINE> EU: Disagreements With Mexico Unresolved </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MEXICO CITY, September 17 (Xinhua) -- European Union (EU)
ambassador to Mexico Manuel Lopez Blanco said Friday that customs
tariff disagreements have hampered negotiations of a free trade
agreement (FTA) between the European bloc and this Latin American
country.
</P>
<P>
The EU "does not understand" why Mexico demands more
flexibility in the rules of origin for the automobile and
electronics sectors than what it obtained in the North American
Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) with the United States and Canada,
Lopez Blanco said.
</P>
<P>
"We (the EU and Mexico) are not near an agreement. One or more
rounds of talks are necessary because there are important matters
that require deeper studies," said Lopez Blanco.
</P>
<P>
According to Lopez Blanco, there are disagreements in some 200
custom tariffs in the chapter of rules of origin.
</P>
<P>
Mexico demands that automobile and electronics exports with 40
percent of national parts from Mexico be granted a preferential
treatment in the European market. The EU rejected it on the ground
that this proposal would benefit foreign producers to export their
products to Europe.
</P>
<P>
The EU representative said that Mexico's positions on both
issues would inhibit investment in the Latin American country,
which risks to become only a processor of intermediate goods.
</P>
<P>
The EU asks Mexico to reduce tariffs to 10 percent or lower by
the year 2005, and "we are waiting for an interesting answer from
Mexico" in the next round of talks scheduled for September 27,
said the diplomat.

<TEXT>
<P>
SANTIAGO, September 17 (Xinhua) -- The Chilean Foreign Ministry
confirmed Friday to have recalled the country's ambassador to
Spain Sergio Pizarro Mackay.
</P>
<P>
According to a press release, Pizarro Mackay was recalled by
Foreign Minister Juan Gabriel Valdes to report on diplomatic
activities in Spain.
</P>
<P>
Pizarro will meet with Valdes in New York on the occasion of
the UN General Assembly meeting to be held there next week, then
return to Madrid, said the release.
</P>
<P>
Diplomatic sources here said the recall was taking place in the
delicate period when Chile is fighting for the return of its life-
long senator Augusto Pinochet from London.
</P>
<P>
Chile insists that the courts of Spain and Britain have no
jurisdiction over Pinochet.
</P>
<P>
Pinochet, 83, has been under arrest in London since last
October 16 on the request of a Spanish judge. Spain wants him to
be extradited to its territory for trial. A hearing on the request
is to begin on September 27.

WASHINGTON, September 17 (Xinhua) -- At least 29 people were
killed in the Unite States as Hurricane Floyd swept up the eastern
seaboard in the past few days with record rains that flooded
scores of towns and forced the evacuation of three million people
from communities, officials said Friday.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, thousands of homes and businesses were damaged, and
over one million households were without power in Virginia,
Maryland, Delaware, Pennsylvania, New Jersey and Connecticut
States. Utility companies warned that many would be without
electricity into the weekend.

rescue over 1,000 people from roofs and trees after the torrential
rains of Hurricane Floyd.
</P>
<P>
In southeastern Pennsylvania State, more than 4,000 people were
homeless Friday after torrential rains sent rivers over their

U.S. President Bill Clinton Friday declared an emergency in New
Jersey because of Hurricane Floyd, opening the way for the state

<HEADLINE> Exiled Paraguayan Former General to Return Home </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MONTEVIDEO, September 17 (Xinhua) -- Former Paraguayan General
Lino Oviedo, who went into exile in Buenos Aires after a political
crisis in March, has decided to return home, one of his lawyers
said here on Friday.
</P>
<P>
Oviedo ordered his four lawyers to prepare a detailed report of
the juridical and political circumstances awaiting him in his
country.
</P>
<P>
Lawyer Carlos Galeano Perrone said, "Despite our opposition,
General Oviedo has the firm will of returning to Paraguay."
</P>
<P>
Oviedo went into exile on March 29 after the assassination of
Vice-president Luis Maria Argana six days earlier and the
resignation of then President Raul Cubas Grau.
</P>
<P>
His self-exile and extradition requests have adversely affected
Paraguay's diplomatic disputes with Uruguay and Argentina. The
tree countries and Brazil are members of the Southern Common
Market.

<HEADLINE> Party Leader Congratulates Launch of New Newspaper </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, September 18 (Xinhua) -- A senior Party leader
published an article in today's "People's Daily" to congratulate
the launch of a new newspaper, "Study Times", saying that the
whole Party should attach importance to study, and be good at
study.
</P>
<P>
Hu Jintao, a member of the Standing Committee of the Political
Bureau of the Chinese Communist Party Central Committee, says that
the creation of the newspaper by the Party School of the CPC
Central Committee is of great significance, because it follows
President Jian Zemin's instructions on better studying Marxism.
</P>
<P>
The paper will serve as a "garden" for officials and
intellectuals to exchange views on study, according to Hu, who is
also President of the Party School.
</P>
<P>
Hu says that study is linked with the ups and downs of the
course of the Party, and historical lessons should be remembered
by Party members, particularly, by leading officials.
</P>
<P>
He cites many of late Chairman Mao Zedong's instructions on the
importance of study, saying that the social stability, the
development of national economy, and the achievements scored in
socialist construction are all the results that the Party is good
at study.
</P>
<P>
Hu says that Deng Xiaoping also stressed the significance of
study, which would help the Party to achieve the success of the
reform and opening up and the modernization campaign.
</P>
<P>
Because China is in a critical historical period when the
international situation is quite complicated and science and
technology are evolving so fast, the Party should attach greater
importance to study so as to catch up with the time and win people
's support, he stresses.
</P>
<P>
What the Party should study hard includes the following
categories: Marxism, Leninism, Mao Zedong Thought, Deng Xiaoping
Theory, and various modern knowledge ranging from economics to
military tactics, according to the official.
</P>
<P>
He notes that the fight against the Falun Gong cult headed by
Li Hongzhi further shows the importance of study and the
strengthening of the Party's disciplines.
</P>
<P>
He urges that the "Study Times" be run by people with political
consciousness who always adhere to the Party's line of
emancipating mind and seeking truth from facts.

<HEADLINE> Production of Pearls and Gems Drops in Myanmar </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
YANGON, September 18 (Xinhua) -- The production of precious
minerals in Myanmar dropped in 1998-99 fiscal year, which ended on
March 31, compared with the previous fiscal year.
</P>
<P>
According to the figures of the country's Central Statistical
Organization, in the 1998-99, Myanmar produced 1.256 million
kilograms of jade, 5.588 million carats of rubies, 2.4 million
carats of sapphire, 981,297 carats of spinel and 12.59 kilograms
of pearls.
</P>
<P>
The production of these precious items respectively dropped by
percentage of 41.68, 24.29, 60.17, 5.49 and 5.24 as compared with
the 1997-98.
</P>
<P>
Myanmar holds gems emporiums annually, putting on sale the
country's locally-produced gems, jade, pearl and jewelry through
the tender system or competitive bidding.
</P>
<P>
Such sale of Myanmar's precious stones has started since 1964
and the promotion of sale has also been strived by adding mid-year
gems emporiums every year since 1992.
</P>
<P>
The country earned a total of 271.3 million U.S. dollars from
the past 36 annual and seven mid-year gems emporiums which
attracted annually hundreds of gems merchants from over a dozen
countries and regions, mostly from China's Hong Kong, Thailand,
Japan and Singapore.
</P>
<P>
Myanmar, a well-known producer of jade, ruby and sapphire in
the world, is striving to create a systematic gem market in line
with its market-oriented economic system introduced in late 1988.
</P>
<P>
In addition to permitting the local private sector to mine and
process gems in the country, the government has also set up joint
ventures with companies from Thailand, Malaysia and Israel to
carry out gems extraction and processing.

UNITED NATIONS -- Yugoslavia has said the disarmament of the
Kosovo Liberation Army (KLA) was a farce because the rebel group
was hiding its best weapons in Albania, Macedonia and secret
storage spots inside Kosovo, the Yugoslav province.
</P>
<P>
The statement came as Vladislav Jovanovic, charge d'affaires of
the Yugoslav Mission to the United Nations, was speaking at a
press conference here. "They surrender what is old-fashioned,
vintage and not of much importance," he said. "But what is really
modern and efficient they conceal." The senior Yugoslav diplomat
also accused NATO and the United Nations of backing the KLA and
its goal of an independent Kosovo, and of encouraging KLA fighters
to join the police, the civilian administration of towns and
villages, and a new national guard. (UN-Kosovo)

pact signed in November 1993. Under the pact, Greece will provide
air, sea and land coverage to Cyprus in case of a new Turkish
offensive against the island. (Cyprus-Greece-Visit)

WASHINGTON -- U.S. President Bill Clinton has decided to ease
sanctions against the Democratic People's Republic of Korea (DPRK),
allowing more trade between the two countries.
</P>
<P>
The measure, the first since the end of the Korean War in 1953,
will allow most consumer goods to be available for export to the
DPRK and will allow the import of DPRK goods into the United
States, White House spokesman Joe Lockhart said Friday.
Restrictions on transportation, banking and personnel movements
between the U.S. and the DPRK will also be relaxed, according to
the spokesman. (US-DPRK-Sanctions)

BRUSSELS -- Chairman of NATO's Military Committee, Admiral

Army (KLA) would partly become a police force in the future.
</P>
<P>
The new committee chief, who took office in May, said that the
ethnic Albanian rebel group will be disbanded and transformed into
civilian societies as the deadline falls Sunday. He said the KLA
men will be helped to find jobs and part of them will become
policemen in the province protected by the international forces.
The KLA hopes to transform about half of its 10,000 men into a
civilian defense corps. Rebel officials regard the corps as the
first step toward the creation of a "national army." (NATO-KLA-

<HEADLINE> South Africa Bid Chief: England Has No Chance </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, September 17 (Xinhua) -- England will have no chance of
staging the World Cup 2006 finals, South Africa's bid chief
claimed on Friday.
</P>
<P>
According to local reports on Friday, Danny Jordaan, who leads
South Africa's bid, fired another salvo in the war of words
between South Africa and England over the bid to host soccer's
showpiece.
</P>
<P>
Quizzed over his dismissive attitude towards England, he said
UEFA's expected support for the German bid made Germany "a
formidable candidate".
</P>
<P>
He claimed South Africa and Germany were the only major
contenders, and that South Africans overwhelmingly support their
country's bid. "Hosting will also make a major contribution to
the economy of South Africa, addressing the very issues, like
poverty and unemployment, which our critics suggest we are
neglecting by pursuing the bid," said Jordaan.
</P>
<P>
Answering questions about South Africa's high crime rate,
Jordaan pointed to 55 major sporting events hosted in South Africa
in recent years, saying 11.4 million people had been involved
without any major incident.
</P>
<P>
"I find it bizarre that South Africa is hosting the 2003 World
Cup in cricket without facing a barrage of crime queries," he said.
"Yet, when it comes to soccer three years later, the fortune-
tellers amongst you seem to think crime will have worsened."
</P>
<P>
However, the All Africa Games have been plagued by a number of
incidents overlooked by Jordaan - including the mugging of a
hockey official, the arrest of a police officer guarding the Games
for car theft, the carjacking of two Games officials and the
firing of gunshots near a bus carrying competitors.

<HEADLINE> O'Neill Vows to Overcome Leicester "Lunacy" </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, September 17 (Xinhua) -- Martin O'Neill is staying as
Leicester manager - but the long-term future of the club is still
up in the air.
</P>
<P>
O'Neill revealed on Friday lunchtime that he will not quit
Filbert Street in the wake of the boardroom power struggle which
has seen chief executive Barrie Pierpoint insist that the manager'
s allies, club chairman John Elsom and plc chief Sir Rodney Walker
resign.
</P>
<P>
The duo are adamant they did not quit at a meeting last Friday
but with four members of the board - Pierpoint and directors Roy
Parker, Gilbert Kinch and Philip Smith - not recognising their
authority, the situation is nothing short of farcical.
</P>
<P>
O'Neill's confirmation of "I am staying" at the club's training
ground brought applause from the 20 or so fans who had gatecrashed
the news conference.
</P>
<P>
They were the same people who had brandished A4 leaflets
proclaiming "Pierpoint out, Parker out" - two of which were placed
on cars belonging to the Leicester manager and Kinch, who met O'
Neill on Friday.
</P>
<P>
At that meeting Kinch asked the former Northern Ireland
international if he knew of a conversation between himself and
Elsom on Wednesday, when the chairman was asked if he would step
down from the board - an option he rejected.
</P>
<P>
And while O'Neill acknowledged the issue must be brought to a
satisfactory conclusion as soon as possible, he also demonstrated
again whose side he is on.
</P>
<P>
He refused to be drawn over whether he would like to work under
Pierpoint, his long-standing adversary, and he said: "I would
prefer it if Mr Elsom stayed as the chairman of the football club
and Sir Rodney Walker continued as chairman of the plc.
</P>
<P>
"I've worked with three chairman in four years and I didn't
envisage working for another one as quickly as this.
</P>
<P>
"They maintain their stance that they haven't resigned, that
they only stormed out of the meeting, and I believe them," he said.

<HEADLINE> Venezuelan Oil Basket Price Increases </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CARACAS, September 17 (Xinhua) -- The Venezuelan oil basket
price increased this week by 1.7 U.S. dollars to reach 20.40
dollars per barrel because of a rise in demand, the Mines and
Energy Ministry announced on Friday.
</P>
<P>
The Venezuelan oil basket average price increased this week to
13.75 dollars per barrel, 4.75 dollars above the average sale
price of nine dollars foreseen in the 1999 budget of the nation.
</P>
<P>
The prices of crude increased since the implementation on March
12 of an agreement between independent organizations and the
Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) that cut
daily output by 2.1 million barrels a day. The agreement will be
in effect until next April.
</P>
<P>
Acting Mines and Energy Minister Alvaro Silva Calderon said
Thursday that output cuts will be maintained despite middlemen
pressures for OPEC to release part of the production retained
during its September 22 conference in Vienna.

LONDON, September 17 (Xinhua) -- English soccer second division
club Reading said Friday that they welcome an application from
Glenn Hoddle for their vacant manager's job, but they will not
approach the former England boss.
</P>
<P>
Club chairman John Madejski, who sacked former boss Tommy Burns
Thursday, insisted there was no rush to find a replacement. "We
will be pleased to hear from Glenn in exactly the same way as we
will be pleased to hear from anybody else interested in the job."
</P>
<P>
He added: "But we are not getting into the business of
approaching anybody. I have learned from the appointment of Tommy
Burns that high profile managers don't always give you everything
they want and sometimes the low profile managers do.
</P>
<P>
"Everybody was absolutely delighted when Tommy joined the club
and he did an awful lot of good. However, in 66 games in charge
he only won 20.
</P>
<P>
"We invested plenty of money in players but I don't believe in
continuing to throw money at things. I can't keep throwing money
down a black hole. I have to get results because this football
club is currently losing 200,000 pounds a month."
</P>
<P>
Madejski said he had telephoned new caretaker manager Alan
Pardew inviting him to take the manager's job on a temporary basis.
Pardew then contacted former England number two John Gorman who
agreed to join as his assistant.
</P>
<P>
"There is no rush to appoint a new manager," added Madejski. "
It's so important to get it right. We have a very good squad of
players and there's no need to rush when we have Alan and John in
charge.
</P>
<P>
"I hope they throw their hats into the ring for the new job. I
would be delighted if they are so successful that we have to keep
them," he added.

<HEADLINE> Guatemalan Foreign Minister Criticizes U.S. Warning </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MEXICO CITY, September 17 (Xinhua) -- Guatemalan Foreign
Minister Eduardo Stein on Friday criticized Washington's warning
against U.S. citizens visiting the Central American country.
</P>
<P>
Reports reaching here from Guatemala City quoted Stein as
saying that the recent warning from the U.S. State Department
citing increased criminal acts against U.S. citizens undermines
the image of Guatemala.
</P>
<P>
Stein considered it "alarming and distressing" that the United
States should exaggerate situations that are common to any
traveler or tourist in any other place of the world.
</P>
<P>
He added that the Guatemalan government is worried about the U.
S. description of the country.

<HEADLINE> Taylor Signs New Deal with Watford </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, September 17 (Xinhua) -- Graham Taylor has given
Watford a major boost ahead of Saturday's home clash with Chelsea
by signing a new three-year deal on Friday.
</P>
<P>
Chairman Elton John led the celebrations, saying: "Securing
Graham's services has always been the key and I'm personally
delighted that he has committed his immediate future to the club."
</P>
<P>
Taylor's new deal came hot on the heels of confirmation that
Saracens rugby club owner Nigel Wray is to join the Watford board.
</P>
<P>
And there will shortly be a flotation by the club's holding
company - Watford Association Football Club (Holdings) Limited -
to raise five million pounds.
</P>
<P>
Taylor recognizes that he faces a task of David v Goliath
proportions against Gianluca Vialli's men at Vicarage Road.
</P>
<P>
Chelsea are the first of the "big three" to visit the
Premiership new boys and Taylor knows he cannot match them for
quality.
</P>
<P>
"Chelsea are so far ahead it is hard for clubs like ourselves
to keep in touch," said Taylor.
</P>
<P>
"They have so many illustrious names - and that's just on their
substitutes' bench - but we have got to try and catch a lift in
their slipstream.
</P>
<P>
"With due respect to Bradford, Wimbledon and Aston Villa, who
have visited Vicarage Road, our Premiership home campaign really
gets under way on Saturday," he added.

<HEADLINE> Humanitarian Aid Reaches East Timor </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, September 17 (Xinhua) -- The World Food Program
(WFP) on Friday dropped 15 metric tons of rice and blankets at
three locations in East Timor, the United Nations announced
Friday.
</P>
<P>
This was the first humanitarian assistance to reach East Timor
since many local people fled into the mountains due to violence
following the August 30 referendum on independence. More airdrops
are planned for Saturday, WFP said.
</P>
<P>
The International Committee of the Red Cross brought in to the
capital of Dili Friday two plane loads of mostly high-protein
biscuits the same day.
</P>
<P>
The U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) Sadako Ogata
was on her way to Indonesia Friday to talk with the Indonesian
authorities about how to help the people relocated to West Timor,
U.N. spokesman Fred Eckhard said.
</P>
<P>
In another development, the Indonesian military sent to quell
the violence after martial law was imposed ten days ago, began to
pull out of East Timor Friday.
</P>
<P>
There will be about two Indonesian battalions, or 4,000 troops
expected to stay on to secure essential utilities such as water
and electricity for the arrival of the U.N. authorized
multinational force (MNF), Eckhard said.
</P>
<P>
So far eight countries have expressed "firm commitments" to the
MNF with negotiations underway for a number of Southeast Asian
countries to take part in the force, Chief of the Australian
Defense Force Admiral Chris Barrie was quoted as saying.
</P>
<P>
The U.N. Security Council endorsed Wednesday the establishment
of the MNF to restore peace and security in East Timor and U.N.
Secretary-General Kofi Annan hoped that the force would get there
as soon as possible.
</P>
<P>
An advance unit is expected to arrive in East Timor on Monday,
according to Australian sources.

<HEADLINE> Colombian Rebels to Start Talks with Gov't </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SANTAFE DE BOGOTA, September 17 (Xinhua) -- Colombia's National
Liberation Army (ELN), guerrilla of Colombia, would accept to
start direct peace talks with the government, it was announced
here on Friday.
</P>
<P>
A business leader who attended Thursday's meeting with an ELN
leader in Caracas announced it here.
</P>
<P>
The Caracas meeting, sponsored by Venezuelan President Hugo
Chavez and authorized by the Colombian government, was attended by
business leaders, Colombian Attorney General Jaime Bernal Cuellar
and Pablo Beltran, ELN central committee delegate.
</P>
<P>
One of the business leaders, Sabas Pretelt, said that the talks
can be held even before the release of some 56 hostages captured
during three mass kidnappings registered in the first half of this
year.
</P>
<P>
Another important point is an agreement on a zone of distension
similar to the one granted by the government to the Revolutionary
Armed Forces of Colombia (FARC) to hold peace negotiations.
</P>
<P>
FARC is the largest rebel group in Colombia followed by ELN.
</P>
<P>
Contacts between government and the ELN broke off after the
rebel group staged two spectacular mass kidnappings of a
commercial airliner and a church congregation in April and May.
</P>
<P>
Colombia's civil war has cost more than 35,000 lives in the
last decade, as guerrillas, right-wing death squads and the
U.S.-trained army battle for control.
