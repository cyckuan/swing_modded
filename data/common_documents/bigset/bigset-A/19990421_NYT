SECURITY TIGHT AT L.A. AREA SCHOOLS

<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ As violence exploded at a suburban Denver high
school, Los Angeles school officials offered assurances Tuesday
that city campuses were secure but no measures could make them
immune to a similar attack.
</P>
<P>
   ``We try to be prepared to keep students safe. When something
like this happens in other districts, we do look at everything
again,'' said Hilda Ramirez, a spokeswoman for the district.
</P>
<P>
   Since a 1984 sniper attack at a city elementary school, the Los
Angeles Unified School District has required each of its 899
schools and centers to develop individualized crisis prevention
plans, officials said.
</P>
<P>
   A crisis team of up to 20 people at each school coordinates
preventive measures, assesses the impact of incidents, advises
administrators how to proceed and coordinates intervention and
counseling, officials said.
</P>
<P>
   Larger protective measures also are in place.
</P>
<P>
   Principals at every middle and high school are required to
conduct random checks of students with hand-held metal detectors at
least once a day, school officials said.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, 307 uniformed school police officers patrol the
district's campuses, monitoring the comings and goings of more than
697,000 students.
</P>
<P>
   All LAUSD schools are ``closed campuses'' with only one entrance
open during the school day. The tragedy at Columbine High School in
Littleton, Colo., occurred on an open campus with several entrances
and exits, which decreases the security of a school, officials
said.
</P>
<P>
   ``No institution is fail-safe,'' said the LAUSD's Daniel Isaacs,
assistant superintendent in charge of school operations. ``But our
school district is at the forefront in terms of preventing violence
and the use of weapons by students.''
</P>
<P>
   In the wake of other recent school shootings across the country,
school districts in suburbs around Los Angeles' San Fernando Valley
stepped up security and started to track idle threats and profile
students with a potential for violence.
</P>
<P>
   In the Antelope Valley northeast of Los Angeles, Antelope Valley
Union High School District has eight campus supervisors and a Los
Angeles County sheriff's deputy on each of its campuses. The
district also recently put security fences around each school and
installed surveillance cameras on its campuses.
</P>
<P>
   In the Santa Clarita Valley north of Los Angeles, guards stand
at gated entrances to schools in the William S. Hart Union High
School District.
</P>
<P>
   At Simi Valley Unified School District campuses in the Simi
Valley northwest of Los Angeles, teachers use a verbal code _ a
simple phrase announced over the address system _ to warn the staff
to lock classroom doors in a way that won't frighten students.
Following the LAUSD's lead, the district also is in the process of
devising a crisis plan for emergency situations.
</P>
<P>
   In the Conejo Valley Unified School District, northwest of Los
Angeles in Thousand Oaks, often rated the safest city in America,
nonuniformed security officers monitor entry and exit points, and
check the identification of visitors and students. School employees
also use cell phones and cameras to keep watch over the schools.
</P>
<P>
   ``The more you hear what has happened (in Colorado) and the kind
of firepower these individuals had and their lack of concern if
they lived or not, it suggests unfortunately this kind of horrible
terrorism can happen anywhere in America,'' said Richard Simpson,
assistant superintendent of the Conejo Valley district.
</P>
<P>
   It's not clear what policies were followed at Columbine High.
Deborah Fallon, a spokeswoman for the Colorado Education
Association, said the state's 176 districts set their own policies.
</P>
<P>
   June Arnette, associate director of the National School Safety
Center in Westlake Village in Los Angeles' Conejo Valley, stressed
there is ``no magic bullet or quick fix to cure school violence.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Programs must include prevention, intervention and security. A
single effort focused on one of those three things won't work,''
Arnette said. ``We need to somehow convince students that they must
report their fellow students if they think they will commit
violence.''
</P>
<P>
   Richard Lieberman, an LAUSD psychologist and a member of the
emergency response team the National Association for School
Psychologists deployed to the sites of school shootings, said the
district's most effective preventive measure is ``The Gate
Keeper.''
</P>
<P>
   The program encourages students, staff members and parents to
identify students who demonstrate signs of violence, Lieberman
said.
</P>
<P>
   Students prone to react violently generally have a history of
bullying, victimizing, rejection or persecution, Lieberman said.
The four most prominent signs of children with violent tendencies
are cruelty to animals, fire setting, bed-wetting and a lack of
remorse for actions that harm others, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``When kids talk about suicide or violent actions, we teach
staff, students and parents to act immediately and seek help,''
Lieberman said.
</P>
<P>
   ``The media plays the large-scale events up so every school in
America worries this will happen in their school district. The fact
is schools are safe havens for children.''
</P>
<P>
   Less than 1 percent of child deaths happen on school campuses,
Lieberman said. But the top three causes of child deaths _
homicide, suicide and accidents _ impact schools in every district
throughout America constantly, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``What we're learning is children need less psychotherapy and
more a sense of . . . safety and security,'' Lieberman said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We know the warning signs and we know the troubled children.
We do not know which one is going to go off. So at best we can try
to identify all the at-risk kids and intervene early.''

<P>
   When he heard the noise in the hall, Adam Foss leaned out of the
choir room, the room where the confident singers of Columbine High
School outside Littleton, Colo., rehearse the kinds of songs that
student choruses have sung for generations.
</P>
<P>
   Hours later, he remembered seeing the barrel of a shotgun. He
remembered seeing a flash of fire. He remembered seeing a teacher
go down. He realized he was trapped in a school under siege.
</P>
<P>
   Foss, 18, said had scrambled back into the choir room, he said.
and herded the other students into a closet, an 8-foot-by-8-foot
room, the kind of musty, stuffy place where robes or sheet music
are stored. Not knowing whether the gunman had pushed into the
choir room and was poised to blast the closet or had gone away,
Foss and his friends barricaded the door with a filing cabinet and
waited.
</P>
<P>
   The boys peeled off their shirts _ the closet was hot and
stuffy, and they dared not open the door. They lifted one or two
classmates with asthma who had trouble breathing toward the
ceiling, where the ventilation seemed to be better. Together, they
waited as the minutes ticked by on the tensest afternoon of their
lives, until police swept through the school and shouted that it
was safe to come out.
</P>
<P>
   But in that terrifying moment early in the afternoon, the
everyday routine of a suburban high school had given way to
uncertainty, and then to panic, as two assailants familiar with the
layout of the school moved through the halls, guns blazing. Later
the authorities said they had every reason to know their way around
the school: They were students there. Bullets zipped through the
walls of a science classroom. Glass doors burst in a shower of tiny
fragments. Pipes ruptured as the assailants set off explosions that
penetrated the walls of the two-story building.
</P>
<P>
   Some students froze where they were _ by their lockers, in the
cafeteria, at their desks. Others tried to make a quick getaway,
hoping not to catch the attention of the gunmen. ``Me and my
friends got to my car and drove off,'' said a student whom The
Associated Press identified only as Janine. Eliza Madden, a
16-year-old sophomore, fled barefoot after losing her sandals in
the confusion.
</P>
<P>
   Still others tried to sneak out. Some had an easier go of it
than others. Foss' twin brother, Nick, had been in a bathroom when
the shooting started and was grazed on the head by a bullet. He
tried to pull himself to freedom through a crawl space in the
ceiling, but as his mother explained it later, the ceiling gave way
under his weight and he tumbled to the floor in a classroom.
Eventually, he made it out.
</P>
<P>
   In the halls, shots ricocheted off lockers as the gunmen in
trench coats and combat boots opened fire with what students said
were semi-automatic weapons. One teacher tried to call the police.
One of the gunmen shot the teacher in the head, said a sophomore,
Jenny Matthews.
</P>
<P>
   ``At first we thought it was fireworks, then we saw them
shooting,'' another student, Jake Apoeaca, told the AP. ``He saw us
and then he started shooting at us. Then a guy in a white T-shirt
threw two hand grenades on the roof. We hit the ground and then we
started running.''
</P>
<P>
   Teachers told students to do whatever they could to do to get
out. In the cafeteria, students began crawling across the floor. In
the library, smoke from the fusillade set off a fire alarm. Amanda
Stair, a 15-year-old sophomore, told The Rocky Mountain news that
one of the gunmen shot the alarm. All around her, students around
her cried and screamed. `` `Don't worry,' they said,'' she
continued, referring to the gunmen. `` `You're going to be dead in
a few minutes.' ''
</P>
<P>
   Some students with cellular telephones called relatives to say
that they had not been hit. Kendra Curry called her grandmother and
said that she was huddled with Adam Foss and the others in the
choir room. Curry's mother, Lorie, said that the grandmother then
let the rest of the family know that Kendra was safe.
</P>
<P>
   Outside Columbine, hundreds of police officers from the Denver
area were preparing to retake the school, room by room. Frantic
parents were sent to an elementary school less than a mile away,
where they waited for word of their children. From times to time,
teachers at the elementary school would tell parents milling about
on the sidewalk to come in, that children had been brought there
and were inside on the stage.
</P>
<P>
   There were parents at the elementary school who could not find
their children. One woman was talking on a cell phone, crying and
saying: ``Her name is not on any list. They don't know where she
is.''
</P>
<P>
   At the high school, students were running to freedom, their
hands over their heads. Some dashed out a back door and past a
yellow fire truck, while others followed police officers who were
running backward as they crossed the nearest street. The students
boarded buses in groups of 40 or so _ school buses and city buses
that had been waiting to carry them to the nearby elementary
school. First one bus, then 5 to 10 minutes later, another one.
</P>
<P>
   As the buses lumbered into the driveway at the elementary
school, red, tear-stained faces could be seen looking out the
windows, looking for parents and friends _ who were, of course,
straining to see who was aboard.
</P>
<P>
   As the buses came to a stop, the parents cried out their
childrens' names: ``Ashley,'' ``Jody,'' ``Mickey.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Obviously the parents who found their children are happy,''
said Gov. Bill Owens. ``The other ones ... '' His voice trailed
off.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Scott Carlon, a 16-year-old sophomore, was standing in front of
the elementary school. As he started to talk about what he had seen
at the high school, a girl named Jane ran up and said, ``Call your
mom. Is your sister OK.?''
</P>
<P>
   He did not know.
</P>
<P>
   One mother and daughter saw each other and embraced, crying and
trembling as their anxiety turned to relief. The mother, Isabel
Naslund, said that she had scrambled over fences and past
roadblocks to reach the elementary school.
</P>
<P>
   Her daughter Julie, a 15-year-old freshman, described an attack
that had surprised and, at first, confused students and teachers
alike.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everybody thought it was a joke, a senior prank,'' she said.
Students had been expecting an onslaught of balloons filled with
shaving cream a few days ago, she said, but that did not happen. So
when the popping started, she said, many students figured it was
just the seniors acting up.
</P>
<P>
   Carlon said that he had been in the auditorium when the gunmen
opened fire. ``I looked out into the hall and to my left, there was
a guy right there, shooting,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   In the auditorium were three teachers and about 40 students, he
said. They locked the doors, sealing themselves in and, they hoped,
the attackers out. ``About every minute we would hear a big bang, a
bunch of big bangs,'' he said, ``with gunshots in between.''
</P>
<P>
   He said that a custodian came in and told everyone to lie down,
then explained a route that would lead out out of the building
safely. They escaped in about half an hour.

<P>
   BELGRADE _ At last, NATO has owned up to the Kosovo convoy
massacre _ but grudgingly, without any real expression of sorrow
and with a lot of unanswered questions.
</P>
<P>
   Brigadier General Leaf referred only to ``the accident scene''
while NATO's spokesmen _ asked Monday what he felt on watching
video of a bomb explosion that killed innocent civilians _ replied
with stunning inadequacy: ``I felt a sense that this is
regrettable.''
</P>
<P>
   This hardly matched the human misery and torn corpses we saw on
the road between Prizren and Djakovica last week.
</P>
<P>
   Nor was General Leaf's presentation entirely accurate. Reporters
did not claim refugees had been killed by machine-gun fire, only
that there were signs they may have been straffed by cannon or
machine-gun fire; we were not told if the A-10s _ which carry
cannons and were present at the scene _ opened fire.
</P>
<P>
   Nor did we learn where the mysterious ``intelligence
information'' suggesting the refugee convoy was a ``VJ'' (Yugoslav
army) column came from.
</P>
<P>
   From America's new friends in the Kosovo Liberation Army,
perhaps? And why did the later ``intelligence'' _ to the effect
that the Serb military do not usually travel in long convoys _
reach the American F-16s too late to stop the attacks?
</P>
<P>
   Last week, President Clinton told the world only one NATO bomb
was dropped. Monday, we learned that nine GBU-12 500-lb. bombs had
been dropped on the Kosovo refugees.
</P>
<P>
   We also learned that the markings of bomb parts found at the
scene by the ``Independent of London'' corresponded exactly to the
NATO ordnance dropped on April 14.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is possible that there were civilian casualties at both
locations,'' General Leaf said, referring to the four attack areas.
``Possible'' was not the word to cover the reality of the burned
skeletons and eviscerated civilians we saw last week.
</P>
<P>
   Were there Serb military vehicles mixed up in the convoy, as
General Leaf suggested? If there were, none were hit _ for the only
wreckage marks on the tarmac were those of tractors and trailers
that still stood on the highway.
</P>
<P>
   I did see Serb special forces and police using civilian cars on
that same highway the following day _ and General Leaf was correct
when he said the Serb military use civilian vehicles.
</P>
<P>
   But what does that imply? That NATO can open fire on every milk
float driving through Kosovo?
</P>
<P>
   The general did his best to prove the pilots had ``acted in good
faith.'' He pointed out the horror felt by an F-16 pilot who saw
house-burning on the ground before he attacked.
</P>
<P>
   But NATO pilots are not supposed to drop bombs according to
their emotions _ and the impression General Leaf left behind was of
a gung-ho air force whose intelligence was first wrong and then _
when it was right _ came too late to avoid the slaughter.
</P>
<P>
   Despite ``reports'' that survivors claimed they were attacked by
Serb aircraft, the general admitted there was no military
verification of this.
</P>
<P>
   Yes, NATO came clean _ up to a point _ which is something the
Serbs would not have done; and if the purpose of the briefing was
to put the convoy massacre behind it before NATO celebrated its
50th birthday, the tactic was probably successful.
</P>
<P>
   But Monday's admissions would have carried more moral weight if
they had included some remorse for the terrible thing that was done
on the road to Prizren last week.
</P>
<P>
   The final message was simple: we did it _ but don't blame us. &QL;

<P>
   BELGRADE _ At last, NATO has owned up to the Kosovo convoy
massacre _ but grudgingly, without any real expression of sorrow
and with a lot of unanswered questions.
</P>
<P>
   Brigadier General Leaf referred only to ``the accident scene''
while NATO's spokesmen _ asked Monday what he felt on watching
video of a bomb explosion that killed innocent civilians _ replied
with stunning inadequacy: ``I felt a sense that this is
regrettable.''
</P>
<P>
   This hardly matched the human misery and torn corpses we saw on
the road between Prizren and Djakovica last week.
</P>
<P>
   Nor was General Leaf's presentation entirely accurate. Reporters
did not claim refugees had been killed by machine-gun fire, only
that there were signs they may have been straffed by cannon or
machine-gun fire; we were not told if the A-10s _ which carry
cannons and were present at the scene _ opened fire.
</P>
<P>
   Nor did we learn where the mysterious ``intelligence
information'' suggesting the refugee convoy was a ``VJ'' (Yugoslav
army) column came from.
</P>
<P>
   From America's new friends in the Kosovo Liberation Army,
perhaps? And why did the later ``intelligence'' _ to the effect
that the Serb military do not usually travel in long convoys _
reach the American F-16s too late to stop the attacks?
</P>
<P>
   Last week, President Clinton told the world only one NATO bomb
was dropped. Monday, we learned that nine GBU-12 500-lb. bombs had
been dropped on the Kosovo refugees.
</P>
<P>
   We also learned that the markings of bomb parts found at the
scene by the ``Independent of London'' corresponded exactly to the
NATO ordnance dropped on April 14.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is possible that there were civilian casualties at both
locations,'' General Leaf said, referring to the four attack areas.
``Possible'' was not the word to cover the reality of the burned
skeletons and eviscerated civilians we saw last week.
</P>
<P>
   Were there Serb military vehicles mixed up in the convoy, as
General Leaf suggested? If there were, none were hit _ for the only
wreckage marks on the tarmac were those of tractors and trailers
that still stood on the highway.
</P>
<P>
   I did see Serb special forces and police using civilian cars on
that same highway the following day _ and General Leaf was correct
when he said the Serb military use civilian vehicles.
</P>
<P>
   But what does that imply? That NATO can open fire on every milk
float driving through Kosovo?
</P>
<P>
   The general did his best to prove the pilots had ``acted in good
faith.'' He pointed out the horror felt by an F-16 pilot who saw
house-burning on the ground before he attacked.
</P>
<P>
   But NATO pilots are not supposed to drop bombs according to
their emotions _ and the impression General Leaf left behind was of
a gung-ho air force whose intelligence was first wrong and then _
when it was right _ came too late to avoid the slaughter.
</P>
<P>
   Despite ``reports'' that survivors claimed they were attacked by
Serb aircraft, the general admitted there was no military
verification of this.
</P>
<P>
   Yes, NATO came clean _ up to a point _ which is something the
Serbs would not have done; and if the purpose of the briefing was
to put the convoy massacre behind it before NATO celebrated its
50th birthday, the tactic was probably successful.
</P>
<P>
   But Monday's admissions would have carried more moral weight if
they had included some remorse for the terrible thing that was done
on the road to Prizren last week.
</P>
<P>
   The final message was simple: we did it _ but don't blame us. &QL;

   After five days of denials and evasions, NATO has finally come
clean and admitted what this newspaper's correspondent, Robert
Fisk, and others have been reporting from the ground: it was Allied
planes that were responsible for the attack on a refugee convoy
southeast of Djakovica last Wednesday, with the loss of up to 80
civilian lives.
</P>
<P>
   NATO still rejects the notion that Allied aircraft could have
been responsible for machine-gunning some of those slaughtered. Its
generals continue to argue that the Serbs may have removed signs of
military vehicles between the time of the attack and the visit of
Western journalists.
</P>
<P>
   Such prevarication is unnecessary, as the admission is belated.
Accidents do happen in the fog of war. The mistaken Djakovica
attacks bears no equivalence to the deliberate massacres that have
been perpetrated by the Serbs.
</P>
<P>
   NATO and its spokesmen should have trusted the public with the
truth from the start.
</P>
<P>
   What is worrying is not so much the incident itself, although
that is tragic enough, but what it tells us of Allied tactics.
</P>
<P>
   The slaughter on the Djakovica road was the result of bombing
from high altitude in a war in which NATO still feels fearful of
engaging the enemy at close quarters.
</P>
<P>
   Although Allied commanders are reluctant to admit it, the
initial month of bombing has damaged Serbian logistics but it has
not taken out President Milosevic's air defenses.
</P>
<P>
   Low-flying aircraft remain vulnerable to his fixed defenses and
to the hand-held rockets that his troops carry. At the same time,
the dispersal of the Serbian paramilitaries in Kosovo makes it
extremely difficult to target them accurately.
</P>
<P>
   That is no counsel of despair, just one of sober realism. Having
entered this war, however ill-prepared, the Allies must win it.
That requires clear-eyed assessment within NATO and honesty to the
public at large. &QL;

<P>
   BELGRADE _ It's not every day the wife of the Serbian leader
writes to Her Majesty's Secretary of State for Foreign and
Commonwealth Affairs. Even rarer when she jots a note to the
Foreign Office while the RAF is bombing her country.
</P>
<P>
   But Mira Markovic _ childhood sweetheart and wife of President
Slobodan Milosevic, Belgrade University professor of Marxism, and
Serbian housewife (a very powerful one, it should be added) _ is
very, very angry.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was with some ten days' delay,'' she wrote in an open
letter to Robin Cook, ``that I learned how you publicly stated that
my children and I are not in Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
   ``My first reaction at hearing that was surprise. Could it be
that the Foreign Minister of Great Britain has really nothing
better to do than care what my children and I are doing?''
</P>
<P>
   Irony, readers will have noted, is a principal ingredient of
Mrs. Markovic's letter _ she used it to deadly effect in 1995, when
she chastised the would-be defenders of the Serb cause in Bosnia
and Croatia for idling away their hours in Belgrade restaurants.
</P>
<P>
   ``I will allow that you may be idle,'' she berates Cook, ``that
you do not have enough state affairs to attend to, and that you
lack family and personal obligations, so that you spend much of
your ample free time caring about other people's private lives.''
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Markovic and her two children, Marija and Marko, are very
much in Yugoslavia, she says; the Milosevic family does not own
five villas abroad, as the Foreign Secretary claimed.
</P>
<P>
   Yugoslavia is far too beautiful to waste money on such luxuries
abroad, she claims, even if the President and his wife had the
money to buy them. ``We could hardly afford to, for financial
reasons of course,'' she adds.
</P>
<P>
   By lying about them, Cook ``wanted to send a message to the
world public that my children and I are dishonest and fearful. To
your regret and to our fortune, you will not succeed in your
intentions _ not where my country nor my family are concerned.''
</P>
<P>
   Yugoslavia, Mrs. Markovic adds, has become the ``capital of
international resistance'' to world domination.
</P>
<P>
   The full flavor of her text, however, can only be appreciated by
direct quotation. ``My daughter is still an editor of the most
popular youth radio program in Yugoslavia...my son is in uniform
and cares about his small new family. My children have highly
developed patriotic sentiments, they are indeed courageous, rather
smart and extremely beautiful...
</P>
<P>
   ``As for me, every day, I am at the headquarters of the Party of
the Yugoslav Left in which I am very active. The citizens of my
country can watch me on TV news several times a week...
</P>
<P>
   ``My children are I are in our place as all Yugoslavs. The fact
that you think we fled our country reminds me of an old saying
among my people _ a thief thinks that everybody else is a thief.''
</P>
<P>
   Then comes the body-blow for Cook: ``How come you thought we
fled? Perhaps because if a similar situation befell your country,
you and your family would flee _ if you had one, of course.
</P>
<P>
   ``I did not commence (this letter) with the customary `dear
sir,' because you are not behaving like one.''
</P>
<P>
   Of course, there's an old saying among British people _ that
hell hath no fury like a woman scorned. But then again, Cook
probably knows that already. &QL;

 By JAMES BROOKE   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   LITTLETON, Colo. _ In the deadliest school massacre in the
nation's history, two young men stormed into a suburban high school
here at lunch time Tuesday with guns and explosives and killed as
many as 23 people and wounded at least 20 in a six-hour siege, the
authorities said.
</P>
<P>
   Beginning at 11:15 a.m., the gunmen, wearing ski masks, stalked
through Columbine High School as they shot semiautomatic weapons
and tossed explosives at students and teachers, with one student
being hit nine times in the chest by shrapnel, the authorities
said. Gunshots continued to ring out at the school for hours, and a
bomb exploded in the school parking lot.
</P>
<P>
   At about 3 p.m., hundreds of police officers evacuated the
building and searched for the suspected gunmen _ both juniors at
the school _ who were found dead of self-inflicted gunshot wounds
in the library, with what appeared to be bombs around their bodies,
a sheriff's spokesman, Steve Davis, said.
</P>
<P>
   ``It appears to be a suicide mission,'' Sheriff John Stone said.
</P>
<P>
   Kaleb Newberry, 16, said: ``I was in class and one teacher came
in and basically told us to run for our lives, I saw a girl maybe
five paces behind me fall. She was shot in the leg, but a teacher
helped her. It was so scary, so close to home.''
</P>
<P>
   Another student, 14-year-old Katie Corona, said she was trapped
in a classroom with her teacher and about 30 classmates for hours.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought I was going to die,'' she said. ``I really didn't
think I was going to make it. We would hear shots, then we heard
crying. We had no clue what was going on.''
</P>
<P>
   Some victims were forced to wait inside the school for rescue.
By early evening, bodies had not been removed because of the crime
scene investigation and the possible presence of explosives, a
spokesman for the Jefferson County Sheriff's Department said. No
precise death toll was announced.
</P>
<P>
   Davis said at a news conference Tuesday night that two other
students at the school, thought to be friends of the gunmen, were
in custody for questioning in connection with the shooting.
</P>
<P>
   Students said the gunmen were part of a group of misfits who
called themselves the trench coat mafia and appeared to aim at
minority members and athletes at the 1,800 student school, as well
as peers who had poked fun at them in the past.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everyone around me got shot and I begged him for 10 minutes
not to shoot me,'' one young woman, who was not identified, said in
an interview broadcast on CNN Tuesday night. ``And he just put the
gun in my face and started bleeding everywhere and stared laughing
and saying it was all because people were mean to him last year.''
</P>
<P>
   Another student, who said she heard more gunshots while hiding
in the closet with a teacher and some friends, said she kept
thinking to herself: ``This can't be happening to our school.''
</P>
<P>
   ``You should be safe at school,'' added a second young woman,
who also was not identified. ``This should be a safe place.''
</P>
<P>
   The mass shooting was the first at an American school during
this academic year, but revived memories of similar tragedies that
struck six different communities last year and set off national
alarms about teen-age violence. The nation's previous worst school
shooting occurred last March when four girls and a teacher were
shot to death and 10 people were wounded during a false fire alarm
at a middle school in Jonesboro, Ark.
</P>
<P>
   Tuesday, President Clinton dispatched a crisis-response team to
aid the Littleton community and the victim's families.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't know yet all the hows or whys of this tragedy;
perhaps we will never fully understand it,'' the president said in
a nationally televised news conference. ``St. Paul reminds us that
we all see things in life darkly, that we only partly understand
what is happening.
</P>
<P>
   He added: ``We do know that we must do more to reach out to our
children and teach them to express their anger and to resolve their
conflicts with words, not weapons.''
</P>
<P>
   A sunny spring day turned into a bloody nightmare for this
suburb of 35,000 people southwest of Denver, as ambulances ferried
the injured past tennis courts, a baseball diamond and a packed
student parking lot.
</P>
<P>
   Frantic parents swarmed at a nearby elementary school after the
police secured the high school; one woman was crying into her cell
phone: ``Her name is not on any list. They don't know where she
is.''
</P>
<P>
   Lisa Appleton, 16, a sophomore, waited in front of the
elementary school just before 8 p.m. for news of her best friend,
Julie Toms, who had been missing since students began leaving the
school. ``I can't even feel it,'' she said. ``There's no way to
know whether she's dead or alive.''
</P>
<P>
   At about 3 p.m., SWAT team police officers used a fire truck and
an armored car to get close to the building, and dozens of students
raced out of the two-story building, some slipping in the mud,
others holding up their hands in the air or behind their heads. The
police said they feared that the gunmen would try to escape by
mingling with the trapped students.
</P>
<P>
   One bloodied student broke out a second-floor window, and
climbed down into the hands of the police.
</P>
<P>
   As police officers established a wide perimeter around the
school, stunned students and school workers gathered on nearby
tree-lined streets and told of the chaos and horror inside the
building.
</P>
<P>
   As fire alarms rang in the halls, students who had seen the
gunmen trampled each other to get out of the building, running
through one exit where three bodies lay on a staircase.
</P>
<P>
   Trapped inside, others took refuge in classrooms, bathrooms, and
a choir room, frantically barricading doors with desks and file
cabinets.
</P>
<P>
   ``Blood was going all over,'' a shaken girl said, as she was
comforted by her father outside the school.
</P>
<P>
   One cafeteria worker who had barricaded herself in a woman's
bathroom, said, ``We could hear them blowing the heck out of the
place.''
</P>
<P>
   Jonathan Ladd, a student, said, ``I heard gunshots going off,
bullets ricocheting off lockers.''
</P>
<P>
   Several trapped students used their cellular telephones to call
television stations when they could not get through on 911 lines.
</P>

   ``I hear a couple of gunshots, people running up and down,'' a
student said in a frightened whisper to KUSA-TV, a Denver
television station. Identifying himself only as James, he added,
``There are a bunch of kids downstairs, I can hear them crying.''
</P>
<P>
   Seemingly aware that the gunmen might be watching on a classroom
television set, he said ``I am staying upstairs,'' and then hung
up.
</P>
<P>
   In a state with a relatively low crime rate, the siege after the
shootings was broadcast live on television all afternoon and into
the evening without commercial breaks.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a cultural virus,'' Gov. Bill Owens of Colorado said
before hurrying to the scene. Noting that he felt particularly
affected by the tragedy because his 16-year-old daughter goes to a
suburban Denver high school, he said, ``We have to ask ourselves
what kind of children we are raising.''
</P>
<P>
   In midafternoon, police officers detained three young white men
wearing camouflage pants and black jackets after spotting them in a
park next to the high school. Later, they said they knew the gunmen
inside the high school. Emblazoned on the back of one man's jacket
were the words, ``Ban Religion'' and a red-painted stop sign
printed over a cross.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   The Trench Coat Mafia is a small band of about a dozen juniors
and seniors at Columbine who are easily recognized yet little
feared, according to people who live in the neighborhood near the
school. Regardless of the weather, they favor long black coats and
the Gothic look popularized by the rock singer Marilyn Manson,
neighbors said. Some even wear white pancake makeup and dark
eyeliner, according to one student.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was that devilish, half-dead, half-alive look,'' said Bret,
a 16-year-old sophomore who spoke on the condition that only his
first name be used.
</P>
<P>
   The group often gathered in the cafeteria after school. Chris
McCaffrey, manager of Angie's Restaurant a few blocks from the
school, said that residents have known about the group for about
five years, and that no one considered it a threat.
</P>
<P>
   ``Mostly it was just kids who nobody wanted to have anything to
do with,'' McCaffrey said. ``They weren't particularly feared. They
were just a bunch of punks who kind of hang around the school.''
</P>
<P>
   Students said the group was mostly boys, but that some girls
appeared to be closely associated with it. One student described
the group as ``nerds, geeks and dweebs trying to find someplace to
fit in.''
</P>
<P>
   Bret suggested the gunmen might have targeted athletes out of
resentment for their own lack of popularity and success at school.
</P>
<P>
   The students ``weren't really accepted as younger kids and as
they got older they were accepted by this group,'' Bret said.
``They got their fair share of being picked on. I could understand
that they might have targeted some of the more popular kids.''
</P>
<P>
   Those here were reminded of other school shooting incidents.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is about the seventh time it has happened,'' Bob Sapin, a
shaken student told a television station minutes after watching two
young men shoot students. ``I just can't believe it is happening at
my school.''

<TEXT>
<P>
   BELGRADE _ It's not every day the wife of the Serbian leader
writes to Her Majesty's Secretary of State for Foreign and
Commonwealth Affairs. Even rarer when she jots a note to the
Foreign Office while the RAF is bombing her country.
</P>
<P>
   But Mira Markovic _ childhood sweetheart and wife of President
Slobodan Milosevic, Belgrade University professor of Marxism, and
Serbian housewife (a very powerful one, it should be added) _ is
very, very angry.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was with some ten days' delay,'' she wrote in an open
letter to Robin Cook, ``that I learned how you publicly stated that
my children and I are not in Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
   ``My first reaction at hearing that was surprise. Could it be
that the Foreign Minister of Great Britain has really nothing
better to do than care what my children and I are doing?''
</P>
<P>
   Irony, readers will have noted, is a principal ingredient of
Mrs. Markovic's letter _ she used it to deadly effect in 1995, when
she chastised the would-be defenders of the Serb cause in Bosnia
and Croatia for idling away their hours in Belgrade restaurants.
</P>
<P>
   ``I will allow that you may be idle,'' she berates Cook, ``that
you do not have enough state affairs to attend to, and that you
lack family and personal obligations, so that you spend much of
your ample free time caring about other people's private lives.''
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Markovic and her two children, Marija and Marko, are very
much in Yugoslavia, she says; the Milosevic family does not own
five villas abroad, as the Foreign Secretary claimed.
</P>
<P>
   Yugoslavia is far too beautiful to waste money on such luxuries
abroad, she claims, even if the President and his wife had the
money to buy them. ``We could hardly afford to, for financial
reasons of course,'' she adds.
</P>
<P>
   By lying about them, Cook ``wanted to send a message to the
world public that my children and I are dishonest and fearful. To
your regret and to our fortune, you will not succeed in your
intentions _ not where my country nor my family are concerned.''
</P>
<P>
   Yugoslavia, Mrs. Markovic adds, has become the ``capital of
international resistance'' to world domination.
</P>
<P>
   The full flavor of her text, however, can only be appreciated by
direct quotation. ``My daughter is still an editor of the most
popular youth radio program in Yugoslavia...my son is in uniform
and cares about his small new family. My children have highly
developed patriotic sentiments, they are indeed courageous, rather
smart and extremely beautiful...
</P>
<P>
   ``As for me, every day, I am at the headquarters of the Party of
the Yugoslav Left in which I am very active. The citizens of my
country can watch me on TV news several times a week...
</P>
<P>
   ``My children are I are in our place as all Yugoslavs. The fact
that you think we fled our country reminds me of an old saying
among my people _ a thief thinks that everybody else is a thief.''
</P>
<P>
   Then comes the body-blow for Cook: ``How come you thought we
fled? Perhaps because if a similar situation befell your country,
you and your family would flee _ if you had one, of course.
</P>
<P>
   ``I did not commence (this letter) with the customary `dear
sir,' because you are not behaving like one.''
</P>
<P>
   Of course, there's an old saying among British people _ that
hell hath no fury like a woman scorned. But then again, Cook
probably knows that already. &QL;

   Q: WHY IS NATO NOT ARMING THE KLA?:
</P>
<P>
   A: Any formal decision to arm the KLA would have to be
authorized by the United States, which has specifically ruled that
out.
</P>
<P>
   Until it successfully persuaded the KLA to sign the Rambouillet
agreement, Washington regarded the KLA as little more than a
terrorist grouping, too weak and undisciplined to be effective as a
fighting force. Those suspicions persist.
</P>
<P>
   Washington also fears that victory for the KLA would strengthen
Kosovan claims for independence from Serbia, a change of border
that the U.S. fears would lead to a free-for-all in the Balkans and
strongly opposes.
</P>
<P>
   The precedents are not encouraging either. Arming Nicaraguan
guerrillas without Congressional approval got Ronald Reagan into
the biggest trouble of his presidency; the arms supplied to the
Afghan mujahidin following the Soviet invasion have subsequently
been used by the Islamic fundamentalist Taleban and may have
assisted anti-U.S. terrorists.
</P>
<P>
   Official denials, however, do not mean that the KLA will get no
U.S.-funded weapons: Washington repeatedly denied that it had
helped arm the Bosnian Muslims, but was forced eventually to admit
that it had.
</P>
<P>
   Q: NATO ESTIMATED MONDAY THAT SOME 3,000 ETHNIC ALBANIANS HAVE
BEEN MURDERED BY THE SERBS SINCE NATO BEGAN BOMBING ON MARCH 24. IS
THIS SORT OF SLAUGHTER UNPRECEDENTED THIS CENTURY?
</P>
<P>
   A: Alas no. In early 1919, as Belgrade reimposed its rule on the
province after the First World War, events were gruesomely similar
to those of today. Villages which resisted were bombarded.
</P>
<P>
   The enemy consisted of rebel bands of ethnic Albanians known as
kacaks (cedilla under `c'), equivalent of the modern Kosovo
Liberation Army.
</P>
<P>
   In January and February 1919 alone, 6,000 Kosovan Albanians were
killed and 3,850 houses destroyed, according to detailed figures
published later in Italy. &QL;

SENOR WENCES, VENTRILOQUIST WHO WAS A TV REGULAR, 103
</HEADLINE>
   (nk) 
 By RICHARD SEVERO   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Wenceslao Moreno, who started his career as an
unsuccessful bullfighter in Spain and then became Senor Wences, a
gifted ventriloquist who was able to transform his thumb and
forefinger into a convincing dummy that endeared itself to millions
of American television viewers in the 1950s and '60s, died Tuesday,
his 103rd birthday, at his home in Manhattan.
</P>
<P>
   He and his wife, Natalie, had lived on Manhattan's West Side for
more than 60 years. They also lived in Salamanca, Spain, Wences'
hometown.
</P>
<P>
   In a career that lasted more than eight decades, Wences
repeatedly proved himself a stellar part of the tradition that
included Edgar Bergen, Paul Winchell and other popular
ventriloquists who delighted audiences from the 1920s well into the
television age.
</P>
<P>
   What set Wences apart from everyone else was that his main
character was not carved out of wood, as were Bergen's Charlie
McCarthy and Winchell's Jerry Mahoney. Johnny, Wences' dummy, was
simply formed by his right hand. He painted lips on his thumb,
draped a ridiculous orange wig across his fist, stuck eyes on the
side of his hand, just below the wig, and let the hint of a body
dangle below. As soon as he began his act, this unlikely creation
came to life as Johnny, a lovable, impertinent little boy, not
unlike the boy Wences had been.
</P>
<P>
   It was shortly after the turn of the century in Spain that
Wenceslao Moreno found that he could imitate others and throw his
voice. In school, when one of his classmates was absent, he would
answer for him, and the teacher would mark the missing student
present.
</P>
<P>
   In those days, he had a friend named Paulo who lived next door.
The friend's mother would appear at an upstairs window and call for
her boy to come home.
</P>
<P>
   ``No, Mama,'' a voice sounding like Paulo would say. ``I refuse
to come into the house.'' When the mother demanded that her son
obey, the voice would continue in defiance: ``Mama, you attend to
your own business, and I will attend to mine.''
</P>
<P>
   Poor Paulo got the dickens on several occasions, until it was
discovered that he had not been the culprit.
</P>
<P>
   Other times Wences successfully imitated the voice of the
mailman, telling the tenants of his apartment house that the mail
was there and ready for distribution. (There were no mailboxes.)
All of the tenants would dutifully come down the stairs and
assemble at the front door, only to find that no mailman was there.
In one instance, an angry tenant dumped a pail of water on the real
mailman's head to teach him not to trifle with the residents of
that building.
</P>
<P>
   The little sprite of a voice and impish personality emerged to a
widespread audience decades later, in the United States in 1948,
when Wences made his television debut and introduced Johnny to
virtually the nation's entire television audience, which assembled
on Tuesday nights to watch Milton Berle's variety hour.
</P>
<P>
   Shortly thereafter he made the first of 48 appearances on Ed
Sullivan's show. Neither Sullivan nor his audience ever tired of
Wences.
</P>
<P>
   Wences' Johnny was not a rake or a wise guy, like Charlie
McCarthy. He was a disembodied insurrectionist whose single-minded
purpose was to nettle Wences in little ways, as small boys are wont
to do. And so, if Wences announced to his audience that a certain
trick was going to be ``very difficult,'' Johnny's little voice
would insist that it was ``easy.'' If Wences gave Johnny a dirty
look, Johnny would add, ``Difficult for you, easy for me.''
</P>
<P>
   In the conversations that ensued, Johnny would seem to be a
completely separate being from Wences, quite capable of saying
anything. There were no jokes, per se. Just snippets of silly but
strangely eloquent conversation. And the exchanges were always
polite, gentle; segments ended with kisses between Johnny and
Wences.
</P>
<P>
   Johnny was not the only star Wences developed. The other was
Pedro, a talking head in a covered box. Pedro was grouchy,
imperious, raspy. He almost did not become part of the act.
Originally, Pedro had a body that was crushed in a train wreck near
Chicago. Wences, salvaging the head, put it in a box. At first,
those who booked the act resisted; they did not think people would
relate to a head in a box. Wences prevailed and Pedro proved almost
as big a hit as Johnny.
</P>
<P>
   Whatever happened in the act, whatever pandemonium there might
be, Wences would always open the box and say to Pedro, ``You all
right?'' Pedro would always respond, ``S'all right,'' to which
Wences would say, ``Very good.'' If Wences presumed too much and
opened the box when Pedro preferred privacy, Pedro would demand,
``Shut the door!''
</P>
<P>
   When Pedro and Johnny were simultaneously in action, it seemed a
wonder that Wences could get through his shows in full control. He
had a palpable Spanish accent and there were times when some found
it difficult to understand him. The laughs came just the same; his
timing and the gentleness of his message were such that he
transcended the bounds of language.
</P>
<P>
   Wences, who was also a formidable juggler, started out as a
young torero in local bull rings near Salamanca. After several
bulls got the best of him, he turned to ventriloquism and juggling.
By the 1920s his renown in both fields was such that he was in
demand in Europe and Latin America. He first came to New York in
1935, where he appeared at the Club Chico in Greenwich Village.
</P>
<P>
   But it was not until he got on television that he became truly
famous. In addition to his appearances on the Berle and Sullivan
shows, Wences also appeared with Jack Paar, Steve Allen, Perry Como
and Jack Benny. He was seen in a specialty act in the 1947 movie
``Mother Wore Tights,'' starring Betty Grable and Dan Dailey. In
1963 he toured with Danny Kaye's International Revue.
</P>
<P>
   In 1996, Wences received the Lifetime Achievement Award from the
National Comedy Hall of Fame for his devotion ``to entertaining
generations of audiences and bringing countless hours of joy and
happiness to millions throughout the world.'' He was also honored
by New York City, which erected a blue street sign alongside the Ed
Sullivan Theater designating a block of West 54th Street from
Eighth Avenue to Broadway as Senor Wences Way.
</P>
<P>
   He remained vigorous well past his prime and was still working
in 1986, when he toured with Mickey Rooney and Ann Miller in
``Sugar Babies.'' His wife, who is his only survivor, said he got
that job because she was able to convince the producers that he was
a mere 75 years old, 15 years younger than he really was.

   SKOPJE, MACEDONIA _ NATO has acquitted itself with honor. Not
through its military efforts or in the political arena _ but
through the alliance's outstanding response to the aid crisis.
</P>
<P>
   Something unique happened last Thursday afternoon at the refugee
camp called Brazda, close to the border of Kosovo and Macedonia.
</P>
<P>
   It began after lunch with the sound of distant chanting on the
far side of the huge tent village. The cameramen and reporters
hurried in its direction, and around a corner emerged a remarkable
procession.
</P>
<P>
   It was a large crowd of children, several hundred in all, and
growing all the time, shouting, marching and waving placards. The
oldest were young teenagers, the youngest were toddlers, hoisted on
the shoulders of their elder siblings.
</P>
<P>
   The placards were in carefully printed English, the chanted
slogans in Albanian, and they were dominated by one word.
</P>
<P>
   It was hard to make out at first, because in Balkan languages,
it is pronounced with a short ``a,'' to rhyme with ``gateau.''
</P>
<P>
   ``NATTO! NATTO!'' shouted the marchers. ``Thank you, NATTO!''
</P>
<P>
   The demonstration was not organized by the children, of course _
a small group of frowning adult refugees discreetly marshalled the
youthful crowd, encouraging the tinier among them to hold their
placards aloft so that the photographers could get a better shot.
</P>
<P>
   But the sentiment was certainly genuine. ``Thank you NATO,''
read one of the more unwieldy placards, ``for the friendship that
you have shown Kosovar refugees.''
</P>
<P>
   Had there ever in history, before the war in the Balkans began
last month, been a pro-NATO demonstration?
</P>
<P>
   Throughout the Cold War years, as the military bulwark against
the forces of the Warsaw Pact, the North Atlantic Treaty
Organization brought a feeling of anxious security to the countries
of the West, but hardly the kind of high emotion which brings
crowds of kiddies out in praise.
</P>
<P>
   In capital cities from Belgrade to London, the noisiest
demonstrators of late have been those excoriating NATO _ for the
muddled planning and rather fruitless execution of its bombing
raids, culminating last Wednesday in the deaths of dozens of
fleeing refugees mistakenly bombed by an American F-16.
</P>
<P>
   But here in the camps, for the first two weeks of this crisis,
NATO has been everything _ the provider of food, water and shelter,
the guarantor of peace and security.
</P>
<P>
   NATO representatives watching the marching kiddies in Brazda
appeared perplexed, almost embarrassed, by the scene.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're, er, delighted of course that they have found what we've
done of value, especially the children,'' said Tim Cross, the
stalwart British brigadier responsible for logistics at the camp.
``Whenever we are asked, we will help.''
</P>
<P>
   Military presence in the camps was being scaled down throughout
last week, as NATO formally handed over their administration to the
United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR).
</P>
<P>
   By this weekend, the intention was that the 12,583 NATO troops
would return to training and preparing for their original task as
the NATO Peace Implementation Force _ the peacekeepers who,
theoretically at least, will one day enter a Kosovo free of Serbian
soldiers to enforce NATO's terms.
</P>
<P>
   But with tens of thousands more refugees expected to make the
crossing into Macedonia in the next few days, the chances are good
that NATO will soon be back building camps, and helping refugees _
the only job, so far, in which it has acquitted itself with honor
fully intact. &QL; 
 &LR;  &QL; 
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
    &UR; (STORY CAN END HERE AT 600. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS TO

 &LR;  &QL;
<P>
   Apart from being a much-needed public relations coup, at a time
of confusion and embarrassment within the organization, NATO's
transformation into humanitarian savior has implications for all of
the international aid-giving community.
</P>
<P>
   Tracing responsibility for the refugee crisis which has swamped
Macedonia and its neighbor, Albania, in the last three weeks is a
tricky undertaking, but it is certain that Slobodan Milosevic's
ethnic cleansing of Kosovar Albanians would have proceeded at a far
slower pace if NATO had not launched its air strikes.
</P>
<P>
   But having triggered the problem, and having completely failed
to anticipate its scale and speed, NATO did more to alleviate it
than any of the organizations which formally exist to deal with
refugees.
</P>
<P>
   NATO's response eclipsed that of the UNHCR, whose reputation as
the world's social security agency remains tarnished by its
handling of the first weeks of the crisis.
</P>
<P>
   As tens of thousands of Kosovars wallowed in mud for three days
at the Macedonian border earlier this month, the High Commissioner
for Refugees, Sadako Ogata, wrote to the NATO secretary-general,
Javier Solana, to admit that her organization had been
``overwhelmed.''
</P>
<P>
   The next day, NATO created a Refugee Support Coordination Center
at its Belgian headquarters in Mons.
</P>
<P>
   As of last Friday, NATO had flown in 4,083 tons of aid to
Macedonia alone, including 1,100 tons of tents.
</P>
<P>
   Theoretically, this was provided under the supervision of the
UNHCR. But between the elegant Mrs. Ogata and the hulking figure of
the NATO commander in Macedonia, Lieut.-General Mike Jackson, there
is little doubt who commands more authority.
</P>
<P>
   As a military command designed to wage war, NATO has obvious
advantages over the sprawling bureaucracy of the UNHCR and its
auxiliary agencies.
</P>
<P>
   When supplies were being flown into Macedonia, many of those
arriving on commercial aircraft were held up by customs. UNHCR
officials had to bite their lips and wait; NATO officers were able
to avoid the red tape altogether by ordering military transports to
bring the aid direct.
</P>
<P>
   Officially, the organization portrays itself as a willing, but
temporary, Good Samaritan with no intention of adopting a permanent
humanitarian role.
</P>
<P>
   Politically, as well, the issue is sensitive: earlier this
month, Russia complained in the United Nations that the UNHCR was
coming under NATO control.
</P>
<P>
   Apart from its humanitarian efforts, the conduct and progress of
the war has so far convinced almost no one. In the Macedonian
capital of Skopje, pro-Serb activists have been handing out
leaflets in which a few extra strokes have converted NATO's
distinctive star into a Nazi swastika.
</P>
<P>
   It will be hard for NATO soldiers to walk away from the relief
and gratitude in the camps, into the hostile, skeptical world
outside. &QL;

NATO STRIKES YUGOSLAV TV AND RADIO STATIONS 
</HEADLINE>

 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   BELGRADE, Yugoslavia _ NATO conducted its first airstrikes
against Yugoslav television and radio stations early Wednesday
morning, firing three cruise missiles at a 20-story office building
and putting three channels off the air.
</P>
<P>
   The building was burning on the top and bottom floors,
indicating that at least two of the missiles hit their target.
Lights continued to shine, eerily, on the middle floors.
</P>
<P>
   At least three private channels, TV Pink, TV Kosava and BK TV,
went dead in Belgrade, though Yugoslav state television remained on
the air.
</P>
<P>
   The building, which in the communist era housed the former
headquarters of the Central Committee of the Yugoslav Communist
Party, contained offices of two political parties: the Socialist
Party of Serbia, the party of President Slobodan Milosevic, and the
Yugoslav Left party, the party of his wife, Mirjana Markovic.
</P>
<P>
   The transmitters for radio and TV Kosava (``Radio Wind''), owned
by their daughter, Marija, were also on the building, one of the
highest in Novi Belgrade, across the river from downtown. BK TV, a
station owned by Braca Karic, whose brother, Bogoljub, is a
minister in the Serbian government, had its transmitter on the roof
and was knocked off the air. The brothers are considered close to
the Milosevic family.
</P>
<P>
   The three channels of state television, Serbian Radio and
Television, stayed on the air, showing an opera. Studio B, owned by
the city of Belgrade, which is governed by the more democratic
Serbian Renewal Movement, also kept operating.
</P>
<P>
   State television reported that NATO attacked the Zezbljev
bridge, the last one remaining over the Danube in Novi Sad, but it
was not immediately clear whether it was destroyed. On April 1 and
3, NATO destroyed the other two Danube bridges, blocking traffic up
and down the river. NATO says the bridges are a military target
because they could allow the resupply of the Yugoslav army in
Kosovo from the rich northern Serbian province of Vojvodina.
</P>
<P>
   The Pentagon and NATO had issued strong warnings that state
television's central office and transmission tower would be struck,
and Western television journalists had been ordered by their head
offices, for the second night in a row, to stay away from the
building. CNN, which had moved into offices in the state television
building, evacuated them on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   The building hit Wednesday morning also contained private
offices, including those of a business owned by the Serbian
Socialist Party; the party's information offices, and the offices
for the New Communist Movement of Yugoslavia, a part of the
Yugoslav Left party. TV Pink is owned by Zeljko Mitrovic, a
prominent member of that party.
</P>
<P>
   The modern building stands relatively isolated in a
nonresidential area, and there were no immediate indications of
casualties as the emergency workers arrived. But Belgrade's Studio
B television said some people were thought to be working in the
building on a night shift.
</P>
<P>
   The building is 400 yards from the Hyatt Hotel, where many
foreign journalists are staying.

BUSINESS TRAVEL: PASSENGERS TO EUROPE BE DELAYED BY TROOP
MOVEMENTS 
</HEADLINE>
  (duplication warning: also sent with `t' code) 
 (bl)  
 By EDWIN McDOWELL   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Although the Clinton administration has said it has no plans to
send U.S. troops to the Balkans, if in fact it does order large
numbers of troops there, many GIs as well as tons of cargo will
likely be airlifted on civilian planes. And depending on the
duration of the airlift, travelers bound even for Western Europe
can probably expect delays and inconvenience.
</P>
<P>
   The troop transport plan involving civil aircraft, named Civil
Reserve Air Fleet, was devised by the Pentagon and the airline
industry in 1952. As Robert J. Serling explains in his book, ``When
the Airlines Went to War'' (Kensington Books, 1997), although the
plan was drawn up during the Korean War, it was not used until the
1960s, when airlines assisted the rapid military buildup in
Vietnam.
</P>
<P>
   The airlines were used again during the Persian Gulf war, during
an even faster buildup. At that time, 11 civilian airlines, 3
overnight delivery airlines and 13 supplemental airlines answered
the call. They flew more than 5,300 missions, carried 64 percent of
the troops and just under 27 percent of the war cargo. Planes from
the overnight delivery fleets flew almost 900 of those flights.
</P>
<P>
   ``Many commercial pilots come from a military background, and if
they're in the Reserves and they're called to duty that could lead
to some crew scheduling headaches at major airlines,'' said Tim
Smith of American Airlines.
</P>
<P>
   Serling, speaking by phone Tuesday from his home in Arizona,
said: ``The civil planes have already been allocated for possible
use by the military in Yugoslavia. If they're needed, they'll be
pulled out of the fleets in stages and turned over to the Pentagon,
which will assign their routes and destinations.''
</P>
<P>
   CRUISE BOOKINGS AFFECTED BY KOSOVO CONFLICT
</P>
<P>
   The current NATO bombing campaign in the Balkans, meanwhile, is
exacting a growing toll on the travel industry. Carnival Corp. said
Monday that the conflict was hurting its cruise bookings to the
eastern Mediterranean, causing cancellations that would likely
affect its earnings. That same day Celebrity and Costa Cruises said
they would change some of their itineraries because of the
fighting.
</P>
<P>
   While few Americans have canceled reservations for late spring
or summer trips to Western Europe, travel agents worry that many
more will do so if hostilities drag on.
</P>
<P>
   Celebrity, owned by Royal Caribbean Cruises Ltd., has made
changes to two of the Celebrity Century's Adriatic cruises. Its
15-night trans-Atlantic crossing starting from Fort Lauderdale,
Fla., this Saturday will now end in Genoa, Italy, instead of
Venice, which is closer to the fighting. And its 12-day eastern
Mediterranean cruise scheduled to depart from Venice on May 16 will
instead leave from Savona, Italy.
</P>
<P>
   Costa, owned by Carnival, will move its Costa Classica and Costa
Victoria ships to Genoa from their Venice home port. In addition,
the Costa Victoria's seven-night cruises to Greece and Turkey,
scheduled to operate from May 9 through Oct. 31, have been changed
to a Greek island itinerary, departing from Genoa and returning to
Naples. Costa Classica's seven-night Greek island cruises from May
31 through Oct. 18 have been changed to a western Mediterranean
itinerary departing from Genoa and returning to Naples. &QL;

   SKOPJE, MACEDONIA _ NATO has acquitted itself with honor. Not
through its military efforts or in the political arena _ but
through the alliance's outstanding response to the aid crisis.
</P>
<P>
   Something unique happened last Thursday afternoon at the refugee
camp called Brazda, close to the border of Kosovo and Macedonia.
</P>
<P>
   It began after lunch with the sound of distant chanting on the
far side of the huge tent village. The cameramen and reporters
hurried in its direction, and around a corner emerged a remarkable
procession.
</P>
<P>
   It was a large crowd of children, several hundred in all, and
growing all the time, shouting, marching and waving placards. The
oldest were young teenagers, the youngest were toddlers, hoisted on
the shoulders of their elder siblings.
</P>
<P>
   The placards were in carefully printed English, the chanted

it is pronounced with a short ``a,'' to rhyme with ``gateau.''

   But the sentiment was certainly genuine. ``Thank you NATO,''
read one of the more unwieldy placards, ``for the friendship that
you have shown Kosovar refugees.''
</P>
<P>
   Had there ever in history, before the war in the Balkans began
last month, been a pro-NATO demonstration?
</P>

<P>
   NATO's most experienced planners are poring over U.S. Army
textbooks written in the Sixties which analyze Marshal Tito's
tactics against Yugoslavia's occupying Nazi troops during the
Second World War.
</P>
<P>
   The reason for the rapid revision is simple. Three weeks of
pulverizing bombardment by the West has not broken Serbian
President Slobodan Milosevic's resolve, or his army. This may be
because the Serbian ruler of Yugoslavia is using the tactics his
Croatian predecessor employed so successfully five decades ago.
</P>
<P>
   Tito's partisans used the classic guerrilla warfare methods of
hit-and-run, avoiding large-scale engagements, and hiding troops
and artillery in forests.
</P>
<P>
   Although the land war is yet to start in Kosovo, there are, for
NATO, haunting echoes in the current conflict.
</P>
<P>
   The much-vaunted degrading of Serb forces has been made
difficult by the fact that Milosevic's tanks and heavy guns are
well hidden and thus cannot be hit. While NATO has destroyed around
half of Serbia's MiG 29s most of the rest have disappeared.
</P>
<P>
   The strategy used by Milosevic and his high command is straight
out of the Tito manual: hang on in the face of overwhelming odds;
never meet the enemy on his own terms; decentralize and disperse
and live to fight another day.
</P>
<P>
   Allied pilots have been surprised by the lack of opposition from
Yugoslavia's integrated air defense system. By staying under cover,
however, it has been saved from destruction.
</P>
<P>
   The Western leaders broke a cardinal rule of warfare by
revealing that there were no immediate plans for a ground war. So
Milosevic was safe to unleash his ferocious campaign in Kosovo,
``cleansing'' the area of much of its Albanian population.
</P>
<P>
   James Gow, a Yugoslav military specialist at the Woodrow Wilson
Center in Washington, said: ``It's a kind of ducking and diving.
You can't have a straightforward stand-up fight. They'll always be
looking to do something that shifts the ground, in any way.''

<P>
   After seeing off Hitler, one of Tito's main preoccupations was
not to be swallowed up by Stalin.
</P>
<P>
   The Yugoslav army's All People's Defense Strategy, seen as a
``system of total defense,'' foresaw command and control being
devolved to the regions, and active involvement of the civilian
population. In the event of an invasion by Soviet and Warsaw Pact
armies, militias would play a full part in the fighting.
</P>
<P>
   For this policy to succeed, Marshal Tito and his advisers knew
they would have to rely on the loyalty and fortitude of the
civilian population.
</P>
<P>
   The Serb psyche has always been one of the underdog, unifying
against an outside enemy. Reports from Belgrade suggest that the
population is uniting behind the Milosevic regime in the face of
the NATO pounding.
</P>
<P>
   Anton Bebler, a former Yugoslav navy officer and analyst now
living in Slovenia, says that elements of Tito's ground war plans
have been retained by the present regime and are likely to be put
into practice if the alliance decide on a land incursion.
</P>
<P>
   There is, however, a crucial difference which will work to the
advantage of the West. The professional officer corps has been hit
by purges by Milosevic and the army is not the same as the one
which was prepared to fight and die for Marshal Tito, socialism and
an united Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
   Morale has been sapped by the humiliating defeats inflicted in
Slovenia in l991 and Croatia four years later, and by poor
leadership and low pay.
</P>
<P>
   In October Milosevic replaced the head of the state security
service with a crony from the police force. In November he fired
Momcilo Perisic, the experienced chief of staff who had complained
that his soldiers were being used to wage war on civilians in
Bosnia and Croatia.
</P>
<P>
   Bebler says president Milosevic may be in full control of the
armed forces, but at the cost of a less effective force.
</P>
<P>
   Not all those in the army have the appetite for the type of
grisly work Milosevic needed in Bosnia and now Kosovo. He has
relied on the 80,000-strong internal police force (MUP) and
paramilitaries.
</P>
<P>
   Robert Emerson, a security analyst who has studied the conflict,
said: ``These forces may be good at terrorizing civilians and
taking care of the lightly armed KLA (Kosovo Liberation Army) but
one waits to see how they would cope with the highly trained and
professional soldiers NATO will be using if there is a land war.
</P>
<P>
   ``Undoubtedly, Milosevic has gained from the experience of Tito
as the West is finding to its cost,'' Emerson says. ``But will he
have the right calibre of men to see this thing through the way
Tito could perhaps have done?'' &QL;

<P>
   NATO's most experienced planners are poring over U.S. Army
textbooks written in the Sixties which analyze Marshal Tito's
tactics against Yugoslavia's occupying Nazi troops during the
Second World War.
</P>
<P>
   The reason for the rapid revision is simple. Three weeks of
pulverizing bombardment by the West has not broken Serbian
President Slobodan Milosevic's resolve, or his army. This may be
because the Serbian ruler of Yugoslavia is using the tactics his
Croatian predecessor employed so successfully five decades ago.
</P>
<P>
   Tito's partisans used the classic guerrilla warfare methods of
hit-and-run, avoiding large-scale engagements, and hiding troops
and artillery in forests.
</P>
<P>
   Although the land war is yet to start in Kosovo, there are, for
NATO, haunting echoes in the current conflict.
</P>
<P>
   The much-vaunted degrading of Serb forces has been made
difficult by the fact that Milosevic's tanks and heavy guns are
well hidden and thus cannot be hit. While NATO has destroyed around
half of Serbia's MiG 29s most of the rest have disappeared.
</P>
<P>
   The strategy used by Milosevic and his high command is straight
out of the Tito manual: hang on in the face of overwhelming odds;
never meet the enemy on his own terms; decentralize and disperse
and live to fight another day.
</P>
<P>
   Allied pilots have been surprised by the lack of opposition from
Yugoslavia's integrated air defense system. By staying under cover,
however, it has been saved from destruction.
</P>
<P>
   The Western leaders broke a cardinal rule of warfare by
revealing that there were no immediate plans for a ground war. So
Milosevic was safe to unleash his ferocious campaign in Kosovo,
``cleansing'' the area of much of its Albanian population.
</P>
<P>
   James Gow, a Yugoslav military specialist at the Woodrow Wilson
Center in Washington, said: ``It's a kind of ducking and diving.
You can't have a straightforward stand-up fight. They'll always be
looking to do something that shifts the ground, in any way.''

REMARKS BY CLINTON: `DO MORE TO REACH OUT TO OUR CHILDREN' 
</HEADLINE>
   ( S idebar with COLO-SCHOOL-CLINTON)

 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Following are remarks by President Clinton on Tuesday night at a
news conference in Washington when he talked about the shootings at
a school in Littleton, Colo., as recorded by The New York Times:
</P>
<P>
   Opening Statement
</P>
<P>
   I want to begin by saying that Hillary and I are profoundly
shocked and saddened by the tragedy today in Littleton, where two
students opened fire on their classmates before, apparently,
turning their guns on themselves.
</P>
<P>
   I have spoken with Gov. Bill Owens and County Commission Chair
Patricia Holloway and expressed my profound concern for the people
of Littleton. I have spoken to Deputy Attorney General Eric Holder
and who, along with Attorney General Reno, is closely monitoring
the situation.
</P>
<P>
   I've asked the Attorney General and the Secretary of Education
to stand ready to assist local law enforcement, the schools, the
families, the entire community during this time of crisis and
sorrow. A crisis-response team is ready now to travel to Colorado,
and I strongly believe that we should do whatever we can to get
enough counselors to the families and the children as quickly as
possible. I know the other communities that have been through this
are also ready to do whatever they can to help.
</P>
<P>
   I think that Patricia Holloway would not mind if I said that
amid all the turmoil and grief that she and others are
experiencing, she said to me just a moment ago that perhaps now
America would wake up to the dimensions of this challenge if it
could happen in a place like Littleton, and we could prevent
anything like this from happening again.
</P>
<P>
   We pray that she is right.
</P>
<P>
   We don't know yet all the hows or whys of this tragedy. Perhaps
we many never fully understand it. St. Paul reminds us that we all
see things in this life through a glass darkly, that we only partly
understand what is happening.
</P>
<P>
   We do know that we must do more to reach out to our children and
teach them to express their anger and to resolve their conflicts
with words, not weapons. And we do know we have to do more to
recognize the early warning signs that are sent before children act
violently.
</P>
<P>
   To the families who have lost their loved ones, to the parents
who have lost their beloved children, to the wounded children and
their families, to the people of the community of Littleton, I can
only say tonight that the prayers of the American people are with
you.
</P>
<P>
   Thank you very much.
</P>
<P>
   Questions and Answers
</P>
<P>
   Q. Is there anything additional that you can say or that the
Federal Government can do to prevent things like this from
happening?
</P>
<P>
   A. Well, I think on this case it's very, very important that we
have the facts, in so far as we can find them out. You know, we had
the conference here last fall. The Attorney General and the
Secretary of Education prepared the handbook for all the schools
that we asked to be widely used. And we do have, from bitter and
sad experience, a great cadre of very good, effective grief
counselors. My guess is that they will be needed in abundance there
for the children. I think after a little time has passed, we need
to have a candid assessment about what more we can do to try to
prevent these things from happening.
</P>
<P>
   Q. Mr. President, there seems to be an epidemic of these kinds
of incidents now. There was Paducah, Ky.; Jonesboro, Ark.;
Springfield, Ore., and several others. Would you characterize this
as an epidemic affecting the nation's school systems?
</P>
<P>
   A. I wouldn't want to use that word. What I would like to know
is whether we can take it, we can learn enough from this, which in
its dimensions, apparently, is much greater than even the others
were, and see what else we can do. I had a very interesting
conversation this afternoon with Congresswoman Carolyn McCarthy and
who, as all of you know well, lost her own husband and her son
sustained a wound as a result of a shooting incident on a commuter
train. And that's what we talked about. I think, tonight, we owe it
to the people of Littleton and to the families involved in this
tragedy, to let them go through the grieving and deal, and try to
get the facts and then the rest of us have a responsibility to do
everything we can to make sure this doesn't make 1999 a year like
last year, that we don't have another rash of this, that we really
can be more effective in preventing it. And I wish I could say more
tonight but I don't think I can.
</P>
<P>
   Q. Mr. President, have you been told, sir, that the death toll
is as high as the 25 figure that we've heard? And secondly, sir,
every time one of these things happens we go through this course of
hand-wringing and saying, ``We've got to stop it from happening
again.'' Is there anything specific and concrete that you'd like to
see happen that hasn't happened yet?
</P>
<P>
   Q. Well, I don't want to make a _ there are, but what I would
like to do is take a couple of days, because we don't know what the
facts are here. And keep in mind the community is an open wound
right now. They have suffered as much as anyone could suffer. This
is the largest group of fatalities, whatever the numbers are, and
I've heard various numbers, even as much as five minutes ago, right
before I came out.
</P>
<P>
   I'd like to answer that question but I think anything I say
tonight can only add to the pain of the people in Littleton and not
serve to solve the problems. So I _ I _ I will answer that question
when I have more facts and after we let a little time pass.
</P>
<P>
   Q. Mr. President, you pray the people will wake up. Wake up to
what, sir?
</P>
<P>
   A. Well, I think, you know, there are a lot of kids out there
who have access to weapons, and, apparently, more than guns here,
and who build up these grievances in their own mind and who are not
being reached. And it's not just Littleton. We know that now, we've
had lots and lots and lots of places. So I don't know how many of
you've been there, but I've actually been there. I know the
community. And it _ it's a wonderful place. And I _ I _ I _ I think
I can't do better than what Patricia Holloway said, the Commission
Chair, you know, if it can happen here then surely people will
recognize that they have to be alive for the possibility that it
could occur in any community in America. And maybe that will help
us to keep it from happening again.
</P>
<P>
   But you know what we put out before, you know the efforts we've
made. And I _ I just think that tonight, we need to focus on the
families that lost their kids, on the children that are wounded, on
the grieving of the community and give this thing a day or two for
the facts to emerge. And then I'll _ I'll try to have more to say
to you.
</P>
<P>
   Q. On just that point, Mr. President, the time you _ you had
that conference last year, your Administration said the students
are still safer sitting in a classroom than they are walking down
the street. Do you think Americans still think that's true? Do you
think that's true?
</P>
<P>
   A. Well, statistically, for all the whole 53 million kids in our
schools it's true. But you know, from the facts we're hearing about
what happened at this school and the possibility that explosives
were out there, that hand grenades were available, that other
things were there, that _ it obviously wasn't true there. It was
obviously the most dangerous place in Colorado today. So I don't
want to _ but that doesn't _ that shouldn't make people believe
that every school is in danger. What it should make every community
do is to study this handbook we put out and see what lessons can be
learned here.
</P>
<P>
   But again, you know, tonight I think the American people ought
to be thinking about those folks in Littleton. Tomorrow and in the
days ahead we'll have more time to kind of gather ourselves and our
determination and go back at this again.
</P>
<P>
   Thank you.

   In the late 1960s and early 1970s, many residents of Denver
began to consider a move to the country, with the promise of new
schools, ranch-style homes with big back yards and a glorious view
of the Front Range of the Rocky Mountains.
</P>
<P>
   Columbine High School, situated in an unincorporated part of
southern Jefferson County, was built in that era. The school and
surrounding housing tracts have Littleton addresses, but little
else in common with that quaint Arapahoe County town of 35,000 just
15 miles southwest of downtown Denver.
</P>
<P>
   The high school, with an enrollment of 1,800, draws from the
largely white, middle-class housing developments that roll
southwest toward Bear Creek and the foothill town of Morrison.
</P>
<P>
   Jefferson County, formerly the western frontier of Denver,
experienced rapid growth in the '60s and '70s, decades in which
housing developments with names like Columbine Knolls, Columbine
Hills and Ken Caryl Ranch brought Windsor and Kentucky Bluegrass
lawns to replace the brush at the foot of the Rockies.
</P>
<P>
   Racial issues in the Denver public schools helped both push the
first residents into the area and set a pace of growth that
accelerated until the oil bust years of the 1980s.
</P>
<P>
   A resurgent economy and the completion of State Highway 470,
designed to take motorists around the southwest suburbs and allow
them to avoid the snarl of Interstates 25 and 70 that intersect in
the city of Denver, helped fuel more housing development in a
region that still draws many from California with the lure of large
lots and great views.
</P>
<P>
   The region's sprawling housing pattern share the look and feel
of areas like the San Fernando Valley and Orange County in
California, the northern and eastern suburbs of Seattle and much of
the west valley of Salt Lake City.

STARS SAY PLUSES WILL OFFSET MINUS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By MIKE HEIKA 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   DALLAS _ Ken Hitchcock's not worried so much about what's
missing from the Stars' lineup. He's more excited about what has
been added.
</P>
<P>
   The Stars will be without suspended captain Derian Hatcher for
the first five games of their best-of-seven Western Conference
quarterfinals series with the Edmonton Oilers, which starts tonight
at 7:30 at Reunion Arena. But the focus hasn't been on the loss of
their best defenseman, the Stars coach said; it has been, instead,
on the wealth of talent the Stars have added to their offense.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I look at the lineup that played against Edmonton last
year, there's a huge difference,'' Hitchcock said. ``We think we're
a better offensive team. We're quicker than we were last year;
we're more skilled than we were last year.''
</P>
<P>
   While fans across the NHL gaped in awe when the Colorado
Avalanche added Theo Fleury and the Detroit Red Wings added Chris
Chelios and Wendel Clark, few recognize just how much the Stars
have added. With the free-agent signing of Brett Hull over the
summer and the renewed health of Joe Nieuwendyk, who missed last
season's playoffs with a knee injury, the Stars have injected an
additional 60 goals into their lineup.
</P>
<P>
   That's significant, considering they averaged only 2.1 goals per
game in the playoffs last season.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are a better team and we should be a better team,''
defenseman Craig Ludwig said. ``We've added people every season,
and we expect to be better every season.''
</P>
<P>
   The Oilers also have improved, making numerous trades and
rearranging their lineup. Goalie Tommy Salo is 8-2-2 since being
acquired in a March trade and has helped the Oilers finally find a
replacement for Curtis Joseph, who left as a free agent in the
off-season. In addition, the Oilers almost completely reworked
their defense. Gone are Boris Mironov, Drake Berehowsky, Bobby
Dollas and Greg deVries. In are Christian LaFlamme, Tom Poti, Jason
Smith and Marty McSorley.
</P>
<P>
   That means the battle of the Stars' offense vs. the Oilers'
defense and goaltending could be the wild card that swings the
first-round series. But equally important could be the Stars' skill
vs. the Oilers' strength.
</P>
<P>
   The Oilers already have vowed to play a physical series.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're the type of team that forces turnovers,'' McSorley said.
``The best way to force turnovers is by being physical.''
</P>
<P>
   But if the Oilers err on the side of being too physical, the
Stars have to be prepared to make them pay with a revamped power
play led by Hull's 15 man-advantage goals.
</P>
<P>
   ``It has to be better, it has to be there,'' Nieuwendyk said of
a power play that operated at a paltry 10 percent in last season's
playoffs and was often blamed for taking energy out of the Stars.
``I think all of us think it will be.''
</P>
<P>
   By adding Hull and Nieuwendyk, the Stars have more depth and
more options with the man advantage. Hull can score from a distance
with a startling one-timer that gives the Stars ``something we've
never had before,'' Hitchcock said. Hull's booming shot is the home
run punch, the 3-point shot, the long pass threat that can open up
the rest of the offense.
</P>
<P>
   Add that to Nieuwendyk's ability to mix in tactical
goal-scoring, and leading goal scorer Mike Modano all of the sudden
gets a whole lot less attention from opposing checkers. With
Nieuwendyk scoring 15 goals in the final 21 games, he'll be the
kind of player that opponents will have to consider in drawing up
their defensive assignments.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can't say how much it means to have all three of them in
the lineup at one time,'' center Guy Carbonneau said. ``If we have
those three healthy, we're a team that can score goals.''
</P>
<P>
   And that might be the Stars' biggest goal for the playoffs this
season. In their elimination series the previous two seasons, the
Stars have been shut down on offense and shut down on the power
play. At no time, have they lost their defensive compass.
</P>
<P>
   So, even with Hatcher out, the Stars expect to be a team that
can rely on their depth of defensemen, the play of their defensive
forwards and strong goaltending. But can they become a team that
develops a killer instinct on offense? Can they become a team that
can draw back and put the dagger through an opponent with a
well-placed goal ... or two ...or three?
</P>
<P>
   ``We've got people who can score goals,'' Hitchcock said. ``And
if we're going to win this series, our people who are very capable
of doing things offensively are going to have to be big factors.''

   LOS ANGELES _ With the dawning of a new day, it can only mean
there is news regarding the Los Angeles Dodgers' bullpen. It's been
like that since spring training began and the trend has slowed
little.
</P>
<P>
   Tuesday, the Dodgers purchased the contract of right-hander
Jamie Arnold from Triple-A Albuquerque and designated catcher Rick
Wilkins for assignment.
</P>
<P>
   Arnold, a former No. 1 pick of the Atlanta Braves, was in
uniform for the Dodgers' game against Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
   It pushes the pitching staff to 12 and it comes because manager
Davey Johnson said he needed another option in the bullpen. Antonio
Osuna is recovering from a blister, not to mention coming off elbow
surgery, and Alan Mills, who's pitched in seven games already, has
some tenderness in his right arm.
</P>
<P>
   ``I need a few more innings out of them,'' Johnson said of his
bullpen. ``I can't use Mills every day. . . . Osuna, he still needs
to be nursed, maybe.''
</P>
<P>
   Since the Dodgers left Arizona on Thursday, their bullpen has
been revamped.
</P>
<P>
   They dealt long-man Dave Mlicki and Mel Rojas to Detroit for
right-hander Robinson Checo and a pair of minor-leaguers. Checo's
first outing with the Dodgers produced five earned runs in 31/3
innings.
</P>
<P>
   Also Osuna was activated from the disabled list and his blister
and recovery from elbow surgery limits his availability.
</P>
<P>
   Johnson said it was necessary to promote Arnold, 25, who has
pitched in 15 games above the Double-A level. Arnold was 1-0 with a
1.29 ERA with Albuquerque.
</P>
<P>
   ``I want to (integrate the bullpen) on my schedule, that's why
12 pitchers,'' Johnson said. ``There's too much at stake here to be
short on pitching.''
</P>
<P>
   Wilkins, 33, was the Dodgers' third catcher behind Todd Hundley
and Paul LoDuca. He signed a split contract between the major and
minor leagues and said he would accept an assignment to Albuquerque
if he clears waivers.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was talking to Davey and he said somebody would probably
claim me, so we'll have to see what happens. He doesn't think I'll
clear waivers,'' said Wilkins, 0 for 4 this season. ``I feel like I
have a lot left to where I can contribute.''
</P>
<P>
   __ Skipping a start?: Johnson said a decision hasn't been made
on which Dodgers pitcher would be skipped in the rotation, a
necessity since they are off Thursday and Monday.
</P>
<P>
   However, struggling lefty Carlos Perez is the most likely
candidate. Perez (0-3) is coming off an outing in which he allowed
six runs in 32/3 innings.
</P>
<P>
   ``It probably wouldn't hurt Carlos to have a couple good side
workouts,'' Johnson said. ``With the exception of (Monday), he's
pitched OK. But when he goes, he goes quick.''
</P>
<P>
   __ A day of rest: A day after dropping shortstop Mark
Grudzielanek to eighth in the batting order, Johnson decided to
give him the day off. Grudzielanek has been fine defensively, but
he's hitting .216 with two RBI. He's also struck out six times and
is yet to walk.
</P>
<P>
   ``Grudzielanek is fighting himself, worrying about too much,''
Johnson said. ``He's too good of an athlete to worry. He looks like
he's about ready to explode, fighting it. The best thing is to pull
him away from it. The guy's got a lot of talent. I want him to
relax and use it.''
</P>
<P>
   __ Balks, walks and chalk: Dodgers outfielder Todd Hollandsworth
had an RBI in a rehab start with Class A San Bernardino. He started
in left field. . . . Dodgers third baseman Adrian Beltre extended
his hitting streak to nine games with a second-inning single. . . .
Saturday's game against the St. Louis Cardinals _ i.e., Mark
McGwire _ is sold out. . . . The Dodgers went over the 100 million
mark in attendance since moving to Dodger Stadium.

<P>
   LITTLETON, Colo. _ In the deadliest school massacre in the
nation's history, two young men stormed into a suburban high school
here at lunch time Tuesday with guns and explosives, killing as
many as 23 teachers and students and wounding at least 20 in a
six-hour siege, the authorities said.
</P>
<P>
   Beginning about at 11:15 a.m., the gunmen, wearing ski masks,
stalked through Columbine High School as they fired semiautomatic
weapons and tossed explosives at students and teachers, with one
student being hit nine times in the chest by shrapnel, the
authorities said. Gunshots continued to ring out at the school for
hours, and a bomb exploded in the school parking lot.
</P>
<P>
   About 3 p.m., hundreds of police officers evacuated the building
and searched for the suspected gunmen _ both juniors at the school
_ who were found dead of self-inflicted gunshot wounds in the
library, with what appeared to be bombs around their bodies, a
sheriff's spokesman, Steve Davis, said.
</P>
<P>
   ``It appears to be a suicide mission,'' Sheriff John Stone said.
</P>
<P>
   Kaleb Newberry, 16, said: ``I was in class and one teacher came
in and basically told us to run for our lives, I saw a girl maybe
five paces behind me fall. She was shot in the leg, but a teacher
helped her. It was so scary, so close to home.''
</P>
<P>
   Another student, 14-year-old Katie Corona, said she was trapped
in a classroom with her teacher and about 30 classmates for hours.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought I was going to die,'' she said. ``I really didn't
think I was going to make it. We would hear shots, then we heard
crying. We had no clue what was going on.''
</P>
<P>
   Students said the gunmen were part of a group of misfits who
called themselves the trench coat mafia and appeared to aim at
minority members and athletes at the 1,800-student school, as well
as peers who had poked fun at them in the past.
</P>
<P>
   Davis said Tuesday night that as many as 25 people were dead,
``a mixture of students and faculty.'' No precise death toll was
available.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can't really go in and do this kind of damage without a
lot of preparation.'' Davis said, ``without a lot of ammunition and
apparently some type of bombs.''
</P>
<P>
   Some victims were forced to wait inside the school for rescue.
By early evening, bodies had not been removed because of the crime
scene investigation and the possible presence of explosives. No
precise death toll was announced.
</P>
<P>
   Davis said at a news conference Tuesday night that two other
students at the school, thought to be friends of the gunmen, were
in custody for questioning in connection with the shooting.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everyone around me got shot and I begged him for 10 minutes
not to shoot me,'' one young woman, who was not identified, said in
an interview broadcast on CNN Tuesday night. ``And he just put the
gun in my face and started bleeding everywhere and stared laughing
and saying it was all because people were mean to him last year.''
</P>
<P>
   Another student, who said she heard more gunshots while hiding
in the closet with a teacher and some friends, said she kept
thinking to herself: ``This can't be happening to our school.''
</P>
<P>
   ``You should be safe at school,'' added a second young woman,
who also was not identified. ``This should be a safe place.''
</P>
<P>
   The mass shooting was the first at an American school during
this academic year, but revived memories of similar tragedies that
struck six different communities last year and set off national
alarms about teen-age violence. The nation's previous worst school
shooting occurred last March when four girls and a teacher were
shot to death and 10 people were wounded during a false fire alarm
at a middle school in Jonesboro, Ark.
</P>
<P>
   Tuesday, President Clinton immediately dispatched a
crisis-response team to aid the Littleton community and the
victim's families.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't know yet all the hows or whys of this tragedy;
perhaps we will never fully understand it,'' the president said in
a nationally televised news conference. ``St. Paul reminds us that
we all see things in life darkly, that we only partly understand
what is happening.
</P>
<P>
   He added: ``We do know that we must do more to reach out to our
children and teach them to express their anger and to resolve their
conflicts with words, not weapons.''
</P>
<P>
   A sunny spring day turned into a bloody nightmare for this
suburb of 35,000 people southwest of Denver, as ambulances ferried
injured, dead and dying students past the icons of serene
high-school life _ tennis courts, a baseball diamond and a packed
student parking lot.
</P>
<P>
   Frantic parents swarmed at a nearby elementary school after the
police secured the high school; one woman was crying into her cell
phone: ``Her name is not on any list. They don't know where she
is.''
</P>
<P>
   Lisa Appleton, 16, a sophomore, waited in front of the
elementary school just before 8 p.m. for news of her best friend,
Julie Toms, who had been missing since students began leaving the
school.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can't even feel it,'' she said. ``There's no way to know
whether she's dead or alive.''
</P>
<P>
   About 3 p.m., SWAT team police officers used a fire truck and an
armored car to get close to the building, dozens of students raced
out of the two-story building, some slipping in the mud, others
holding up their hands in the air or behind their heads. The police
said they feared that the gunmen would try to escape by mingling
with the trapped students.
</P>
<P>
   One bloodied student broke out a second-floor window, and
climbed down into the hands of the police.
</P>
<P>
   As police officers established a wide perimeter around the
school, stunned students and school workers gathered on nearby
tree-lined streets and told of the chaos and horror inside the
building.
</P>
<P>
   As fire alarms rang in the halls, students who had seen the
gunmen trampled each other to get out of the building, running
through one exit where three bodies lay on a staircase.
</P>
<P>
   Trapped inside, others took refuge in classrooms, bathrooms, and
a choir room, frantically barricading doors with desks and file
cabinets.
</P>
<P>
   ``Blood was going all over,'' a shaken girl said, as she was
comforted by her father outside the school.
</P>
<P>
   One cafeteria worker who had barricaded herself in a woman's
bathroom, said, ``We could hear them blowing the heck out of the
place.''
</P>
<P>
   Jonathan Ladd, a student, said, ``I heard gunshots going off,
bullets ricocheting off lockers.''
</P>
<P>
   Several trapped students used their cellular telephones to call
television stations when they could not get through on 911 lines.
</P>
<P>
   ``I hear a couple of gunshots, people running up and down,'' a
student said in a frightened whisper to KUSA-TV, a Denver
television station. Identifying himself only as James, he added,
``There are a bunch of kids downstairs, I can hear them crying.''
</P>
<P>
   Seemingly aware that the gunmen might be watching on a classroom
television set, he said ``I am staying upstairs,'' and then hung
up.
</P>
<P>
   In a state with a relatively low crime rate, the siege after the
shootings was broadcast live on television all afternoon and into
the evening without commercial breaks.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a cultural virus,'' Gov. Bill Owens of Colorado said
before hurrying to the scene. Noting that he felt particularly
affected by the tragedy because his 16-year-old daughter goes to a
suburban Denver high school, he said, ``We have to ask ourselves
what kind of children we are raising.''
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   In midafternoon, police officers detained three young white men
wearing camouflage pants and black jackets after spotting them in a
park next to the high school. Later, they said they knew the gunmen
inside the high school. Emblazoned on the back of one man's jacket
were the words, ``Ban Religion'' and a red-painted stop sign
printed over a cross.
</P>
<P>
   The Trench Coat Mafia is a small band of about a dozen juniors
and seniors at Columbine who are easily recognized yet little
feared, according to people who live in the neighborhood near the
school. Regardless of the weather, they favor long black coats and
the Gothic look popularized by the rock star Marilyn Manson,
neighbors said. Some even wear white pancake makeup and dark
eyeliner, according to one student.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was that devilish, half-dead, half-alive look,'' said Bret,
a 16-year-old sophomore who spoke on the condition that only his
first name be used.
</P>
<P>
   The group often gathered in the cafeteria after school. Chris
McCaffrey, manager of Angie's Restaurant a few blocks from the
school, said that residents have known about the group for about
five years, and that no one considered it a threat.
</P>
<P>
   ``Mostly it was just kids who nobody wanted to have anything to
do with,'' McCaffrey said. ``They weren't particularly feared. They
were just a bunch of punks who kind of hang around the school.''
</P>
<P>
   Students said the group was mostly boys, but that some girls
appeared to be closely associated with it. One student described
the group as ``nerds, geeks and dweebs trying to find someplace to
fit in.''
</P>
<P>
   Bret suggested the gunmen might have targeted athletes out of
resentment for their own lack of popularity and success at school.
</P>
<P>
   The students ``weren't really accepted as younger kids and as
they got older they were accepted by this group,'' Bret said.
``They got their fair share of being picked on. I could understand
that they might have targeted some of the more popular kids.''
</P>
<P>
   Those here were reminded of other school shooting incidents.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is about the seventh time it has happened,'' Bob Sapin, a
shaken student told a television station minutes after watching two
young men shoot students. ``I just can't believe it is happening at
my school.''

FOR FINLEY, TWO IS TOO MANY IN DEFEAT
</HEADLINE>

<P>
   TORONTO _ Chuck Finley went to bed Tuesday night thinking about
two pitches. Two lousy pitches.
</P>
<P>
   The left-hander made 100 in all, but the two bad ones cost him
and the Angels in a 5-1 loss to the Toronto Blue Jays in front of
23,775 at SkyDome.
</P>
<P>
   The Blue Jays' victory was their sixth in a row, while the
Angels have lost three of four and fallen two games below .500
(6-8) for the first time this season.
</P>
<P>
   Blue Jays starter Kelvim Escobar (2-0) gave up one run and eight
hits in 61/3 innings to get the win. But it didn't matter to Finley
(1-2) that the Angels offense failed to come up with clutch hits.
After the game he couldn't stop talking about his two mistakes.
</P>
<P>
   Both came in the Blue Jays' four-run fifth inning. The first was
a 3-2 offering to Carlos Delgado that was ruled high. The
bases-loaded walk forced in a run to give the Toronto a 2-1 lead.
The next was a 1-2 fastball to Tony Fernandez, who ripped it into
the gap in left-center, scoring all three baserunners for a 5-1
advantage and knocking Finley out of the game.
</P>
<P>
   ``It basically came down to two pitches,'' Finley said. ``The
pitch to Delgado. . . . I have to bear down against Fernandez. I
had just thrown a fastball in for a strike and tried to come in
again but left it out over the plate. And he got it.''
</P>
<P>
   It all happened when it appeared Finley might work his way out
of trouble.
</P>
<P>
   The Jays loaded the bases on a hit batsman, a bunt single and a
walk with nobody out. But Finley got Jose Cruz on a pop to second
and struck out Shawn Green for the first two outs of the inning.
</P>
<P>
   ``The last out is always the toughest,'' Finley said. ``That was
a big one.
</P>
<P>
   ``I made too many pitches. I had great stuff tonight, but 100
pitches in 42/3 innings _ that's ridiculous. . . . I feel great,
that's what's so frustrating about it. I've got everything working.
What's so frustrating is I've got to make two pitches. I miss one,
miss the other, and it's `See you later.' ''
</P>
<P>
   Finley's line: 42/3 innings, five runs, five hits, three walks,
four strikeouts.
</P>
<P>
   The Angels had their chances early against Escobar but couldn't
come up with the big hit, even though they had the right hitter at
the plate.
</P>
<P>
   Troy Glaus went into the game hitting .455 (5 for 11) with five
RBI when batting with runners in scoring position. Still, in the
first inning after the Angels had already scored on Tim Salmon's
RBI single, Glaus struck out with runners on first and third to end
the inning. Then in the third, Glaus came to the plate with runners
on second and third and one out and struck out again.
</P>
<P>
   Glaus wasn't the only one to fail in a clutch situation. In the
seventh, the Angels had runners on second and third with one out,
but Darin Erstad popped out to shallow left and Salmon struck out.
</P>
<P>
   ``In certain situations we don't even need a hit,'' Angels
manager Terry Collins said. ``When the situation calls for a ground
ball or a fly ball, they're giving you a run for an out. Escobar
stepped up and got the strikeout when he needed it.''
</P>
<P>
   The Blue Jays also played outstanding defense behind Escobar.
Green robbed Erstad of extra bases with a leaping catch at the
fence in right field in the fifth. That came one batter after
Fernandez made a barehanded play on a chopper by Randy Velarde.
Center fielder Jose Cruz went into the left-center field gap to
make a running catch on a drive by Andy Sheets in the seventh.
</P>
<P>
   ``Tony made a nice play at third, they made two nice running
catches in the outfield,'' Collins noted. ``But we had
opportunities to get back in the game and we didn't do it.''

BONDS JOINS LONG LIST OF STARS OUT OF ACTION
</HEADLINE>
   (mk) 
 By MURRAY CHASS   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Barry Bonds, the pivotal player on the first-place San Francisco
Giants, Tuesday joined a growing roster of star players who are out
of action and on the disabled list.
</P>
<P>
   A visitor to the disabled list only once in his first 13 years
in the major leagues, Bonds had surgery on his left elbow and
triceps tendon and is expected to miss at least 10 weeks. His
absence will be a blow to the Giants because he was enjoying a
particularly strong start, leading the National League with a
slugging percentage of .805 and hitting .366 with 12 runs batted in
and four home runs in 12 games.
</P>
<P>
   Will Clark, Baltimore's first baseman, was also placed on the
disabled list Tuesday. He has a fractured left thumb and is
expected to miss four weeks. Cal Ripken, his teammate, who had
never been on the disabled list, is there with nerve irritation in
his lower back.
</P>
<P>
   Jim Edmonds, Anaheim's center fielder, is out for four months
with a shoulder injury, and Alex Rodriguez, Seattle's shortstop,
had surgery for torn knee cartilage earlier this month and was
expected to face four to six weeks in rehabilitation.
</P>
<P>
   The rash of injuries to star players began just before spring
training when Moises Alou of Houston tore a knee ligament. He hopes
to return for the last month of the season. Kerry Wood of the
Chicago Cubs, an instant star as a rookie last season with a
torrent of strikeouts, tore an elbow ligament during spring
training.
</P>
<P>
   The Giants said Bonds' problems did not stem from one incident.
Manager Dusty Baker blamed it on ``20 years of throwing.''
</P>
<P>
   Bonds told Baker last Friday night during batting practice that
his elbow was bothering him. ``Barry's not one to complain,'' Baker
said Tuesday in San Francisco. ``He knew something was wrong _ and
something was wrong.''
</P>
<P>
   Bonds, a 34-year-old left-handed hitter and thrower, played
Friday night and Saturday against Arizona, getting a double in
seven times at bat. He missed Sunday's game against the
Diamondbacks and Monday night's game against Florida. A magnetic
resonance imaging test done Monday showed bone spurs in his elbow.
Additional tests found a damaged triceps tendon.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Arthur Ting, the team orthopedist for the San Jose Sharks
hockey team, performed the operation. Dr. William Montgomery, the
Giants' physician, observed the operation and said: ``The prognosis
is that Barry may return to competition in a minimum of 10 weeks'
time. Given his history of recovery from previous surgeries, we're
very optimistic that he will return without incident.''
</P>
<P>
   Stan Conte, the Giants' assistant athletic trainer who also
observed the surgery, said the bone spur and damaged tendon tissue
were right on top of each other. ``The tissue looked better than we
feared, but not as good as we hoped,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Bonds is a three-time winner of the Most Valuable Player award,
an eight-time all-star and a seven-time Gold Glove winner. ``It's
probably one of the largest challenges I've faced since I've been
manager here,'' Baker said of running the club in Bonds' absence.
</P>
<P>
   The Giants had a surplus of outfielders in spring training and
considered trading one, perhaps Stan Javier. But they decided to
keep their outfield platoon intact, and Javier will replace the
best left fielder in baseball. The Giants will look for increased
production from Ellis Burks, the right fielder, who hit a three-run
homer in the first inning Monday in San Francisco's 5-4 victory
over the Marlins.
</P>
<P>
   The Giants, who last year lost to the Chicago Cubs in a one-game
playoff for the National League's wild-card spot, had been
considered a wild-card candidate at best this season. However, the
Giants got off to a fast start and have been in first place in the
National League West every day so far this season. Bonds hit his
four home runs in the first nine games, six of which the Giants
won.

BASEBALL COLUMN: A MODEST SUGGESTION FROM A BLOWOUT VICTIM 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By MURRAY CHASS   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ The Yankees' 4-0 victory over the Texas Rangers at
Yankee Stadium on Tuesday night did not qualify for the 10-run rule
that Rangers manager Johnny Oates talked about before the game. But
it might as well have, so dominant was David Cone. The Rangers,
with three harmless singles against Cone in eight innings, did not
have a chance.
</P>
<P>
   That basically was what Oates had been discussing earlier, games
that reach a point where one of the teams has no chance. Major
League Baseball, he suggested, may want to consider instituting a
10-run rule. If one team is ahead by 10 or more runs after seven
innings, he said, the game should end.
</P>
<P>
   If that sounds like an idea borrowed from softball, it's because
the team that Oates manages, the Texas Rangers, has played some
games this young season that have resembled slow-pitch games. The
Rangers are eminently capable of scoring 10 or more runs in the
first seven innings, but they also are eminently capable of giving
up 10 or more runs in the first seven innings.
</P>
<P>
   ``How many times does the lead change hands after that?'' Oates
asked.
</P>
<P>
   Based on this season's experience, none. The American League has
had seven games and the National League four games in which the run
differential has been 10 or more after seven innings (10 times) or
eight innings (once). In every instance, the lead did not change;
in most cases, it didn't even shrink much, and the games might as
well have been ended before the ninth inning.
</P>
<P>
   ``The fans will get their money's worth,'' Oates said. ``They've
seen three and a half hours of knocking heads. You don't have to
worry about them. You want to speed the game up? The game's been
decided. It's not going to change hands.''
</P>
<P>
   If one-sided games were halted, the former catcher explained,
managers wouldn't be put in the position of using up more pitchers
and possibly calling on a utility player to mop up in the ninth
inning. The rule also would eliminate the chance of brawls caused
when the winning team runs up the score.
</P>
<P>
   Oates, who admitted that as a young fan he prayed for extra
innings so he could see longer games, added one possible exception
to his 10-run rule, at least for current events.
</P>
<P>
   ``Mark McGwire might get two more at-bats in the eighth and
ninth inning,'' he said. ``Fans would want to see that. Maybe the
Cardinals could play nine and everybody else play seven.''
</P>
<P>
   Oates knows about one-sided games because three of the Rangers'
first eight games featured leads of 10 runs after seven innings.
The Rangers were on the losing end in the first two, against
Detroit opening day and against Anaheim five days later.
Embarrassingly for the Rangers, Rick Helling, their 20-game winner
in 1998, was the starting pitcher in both games.
</P>
<P>
   Helling has not been alone in starting poorly. The Rangers' five
starters have a 7.66 earned run average, next to worst in the
American League, better only than the 8.45 the Minnesota Twins'
starters have amassed.
</P>
<P>
   John Burkett, who lasted only into the third inning Tuesday
night and gave up two home runs to Paul O'Neill after O'Neill had
failed to get a hit in the previous four games, has the worst ERA
on the entire Texas staff, a nice round 12.00. He has pitched a
total of nine innings in his first three starts. Mark Clark has a
10.67 ERA in three starts, and Helling, after making a strong third
start, has an 8.59 ERA.
</P>
<P>
   Aaron Sele has been the staff ``ace'' in the early weeks with a
3.78 ERA Mike Morgan, pitching for his major league-record 11th
team in an 18-year career, has been the staff surprise with a 3-0
record in two starts and three relief appearances and a 3.72 ERA
(5.11 as a starter).
</P>
<P>
   ``You wouldn't buy a stock after studying it for only seven or
eight days,'' Oates said. ``We have watched these pitchers for a
long time. We know what they're capable of doing.''
</P>
<P>
   The Rangers, who tried but failed over the winter to sign Randy
Johnson or trade for Roger Clemens, knew going in that their
starting rotation wouldn't be one of the best in the league. But
they also didn't expect their pitchers to be battered the way they
have been. Oates, however, remained confident they would settle
down and provide a much more respectable performance before long.
</P>
<P>
   ``If they had these games in July, you wouldn't think twice
about it,'' he said. ``Their earned run averages wouldn't even go
up that much then. But it's the beginning of the season, so it's
much more noticeable.''
</P>
<P>
   Last season, on the way to their second division championship in
three years, the Rangers had a 4.99 staff ERA, just missing the
5.00 plateau that two other teams reached. Oates said he wasn't
sure his pitchers would miss it again this season, but he believed
they would be closer to 5.00 than their present 6.31 ERA.
</P>
<P>
   Their chances would probably be better if some of the Rangers'
games ended after seven innings.

CONE'S ARM PUTS END TO YANKS' SLIDE 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By JACK CURRY   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ It rained for most of the day before sunlight peeked
briefly over Yankee Stadium, about 90 minutes before Tuesday
night's first pitch. That was about the time David Cone strolled
casually into the clubhouse, looking as if he could take a nap.
</P>
<P>
   This is supposed to be the kind of inclement weather that
challenges Cone, makes his valuable fingers tingle and makes the
Yankees worry a bit. It was a raw 48 degrees at game time, and the
flags perched high above the outfield fence were fluttering. Could
Cone thrive in the chilly conditions and in the panicky conditions
that exist only for the Yankees after a four-game losing streak? Of
course.
</P>
<P>
   Cone continued to baffle opponents with a wider array of pitches
and arm angles than found in some teams' rotations, and Paul
O'Neill ended an 0-for-15 drought with two home runs to power the
Yankees to a much-needed 4-0 victory over the Rangers. It was
necessary for the Yankees to prevail and resume playing like the
formidable team they are, not that anyone suddenly doubts that they
will be playing in October.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was big,'' Cone admitted. ``It was an awful weekend in
Detroit. No one was happy. Maybe it was a wake-up call for us.''
</P>
<P>
   With Cone retiring 16 of the first 18 batters he faced and
O'Neill treating John Burkett like a batting-practice pitcher, the
Yankees rolled. Cone used fastballs and curveballs early and
injected his slider and split-finger pitch a little later to tame
the Rangers on three hits and three walks over eight innings, with
seven strikeouts.
</P>
<P>
   O'Neill went deep in his first two at-bats and also whacked a
fly ball to the left-field warning track. Things were back to
normal for the Yankees.
</P>
<P>
   ``The beginning of the story, the end of the story and
everything in between was David Cone tonight,'' said Texas manager
Johnny Oates. ``That's as well as I've ever seen him pitch. He had
everything working.''
</P>
<P>
   Cone, who allowed one hit over five and one-third innings in the
extremely wet conditions of the home opener against the Tigers, was
immune to the cold again Tuesday night and raised his record to 3-0
with an 0.93 earned run average. The 36-year-old right-hander
admits that he has been spurred on by questions about his
surgically repaired shoulder and whether he could pitch splendidly
for another season.
</P>
<P>
   Cone is eliminating the questions and, for now, is the most
reliable starter in the rotation. Opponents have 8 hits in 66
at-bats, an anemic .121 average. Forget the weather, forget the
shoulder and forget Cone's brutal beginning from last season.
</P>
<P>
   ``It means a lot to me,'' Cone said. ``I know I'm going to get
scrutinized after what I've been through. I don't take any offense
to the questions. I use it as motivation.''
</P>
<P>
   Although Cone has never pitched a shutout while going 51-17 with
the Yankees, the interim manager Don Zimmer removed him after 100
pitches and used Mariano Rivera to finish the ninth.
</P>
<P>
   ``I asked him if he got a bonus if he pitches a shutout and he
said no,'' Zimmer said. ``I told him, `You're gone.'''
</P>
<P>
   Cone, who knows the season is long and perilous, said, ``It was
the right move.''
</P>
<P>
   It had been almost nine years since the Yankees went four
straight games in which they scored one run or fewer, and they were
in danger of equaling that mark Tuesday night. For about 10
minutes. Then O'Neill crushed Burkett's 2-0 changeup over the
right-center-field fence to knock in Derek Jeter, who had singled,
and give the revived Yankees a 2-0 lead in the first.
</P>
<P>
   After smashing his 0-for-15 slide, O'Neill never even smiled.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a relief,'' O'Neill said. ``No one wants to go 0 for 5 or
0 for 15.''
</P>
<P>
   Zimmer joked, ``He might come in smiling tomorrow. It would be
nice.''
</P>
<P>
   After the Yankees stranded three against Burkett in the second,
O'Neill victimized the laboring right-hander in the third. Burkett
tossed another changeup, and O'Neill drilled it into the first row
of seats about 50 feet from the foul pole in right. It was
O'Neill's fifth homer in 43 at-bats against Burkett, who left two
batters later because Cone's pitching gave Oates no choice.
</P>
<P>
   With the Yankees' losing streak over, Zimmer should be able to
go out in public today without getting badgered. He was getting his
one-minute haircut in Rye Brook, N.Y., on Monday when, he said, a
75-year-old customer snapped, ``What the heck happened to the
Yankees?''
</P>
<P>
   Zimmer said he thought about the two titles the Yankees have won
in the last three years and barked back, ``You're spoiled.'' That
was especially true for fans Tuesday night because of Cone and
O'Neill. &QL;

EDITORIAL: GUN SPREE AT COLUMBINE HIGH 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The New York Times said in an editorial for Wednesday, April 21:
</P>
<P>
   Once again a routine school day was interrupted by blasts of
gunfire when two young men clad in masks and long black trench
coats began shooting Tuesday at fellow students at Columbine High
School in Littleton, Colo. Their semi-automatic-weapons fire and
explosions claimed as many as 25 lives, including their own. It was
the largest death toll in an act of terrorism at one of the
nation's schools. At least 20 people were taken to local hospitals
with gunshot and shrapnel wounds, including one girl who suffered
nine shrapnel wounds to the chest.
</P>
<P>
   The two gunmen, both juniors at the school, were found dead in
the school library after what a sheriff described as a suicide
mission. They apparently belonged to a small group of students
known as the ``trench coat Mafia.'' But exactly what prompted their
attack, and where they obtained the arsenal of weapons to carry it
out, is not yet known. In coming days, no doubt, these and other
key details should emerge. Meanwhile, it is not too early to begin
drawing lessons.
</P>
<P>
   One is that schools must become more adept at spotting potential
troublemakers before they resort to gunfire. Another even more
obvious lesson _ but one largely forgotten after the shock of last
year's spate of school shootings wore off _ is the urgent need for
concerted action by Congress, state legislatures and gun
manufacturers to keep guns out of the hands of troubled youngsters.
School shootings had been in decline this year, but Tuesday's
blasts in Colorado are a grim reminder that guns are still too
readily available.

LEGENDS MUST REALIZE WHEN IT'S TIME TO GO 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By LAURA VECSEY  
 c.1999 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEATTLE _ In the summer of 1996, when jockey Julie Krone was
just a few years past her best riding and her most serious
injuries, she got whacked with another career setback.
</P>
<P>
   Just as the Saratoga meet was heating up in upstate New York,
one local horse racing writer wrote in his column about a rumor he
had heard concerning Krone.
</P>
<P>
   There are always a lot of rumors around horse racing, one of the
most cutthroat sports in the galaxy, but this one took the prize:
Krone was pregnant.
</P>
<P>
   Within hours of the article's publication, the backstretch and
the jockey quarters and the bars around Saratoga were buzzing with
the rumor, which was not true.
</P>
<P>
   It didn't take but a day for Krone, her husband and her attorney
to make a speedy trip to the newspaper's managing editor to demand
this rumor be quashed and a correction printed. Krone and her
entourage were justifiably incensed, since the mere hint of a
pregnancy had stopped trainers and owners from asking Krone to ride
their mounts.
</P>
<P>
   In this way, Krone's experience as one of sport's most
accomplished superstars differs from that of Wayne Gretzky, Michael
Jordan, John Elway or Cal Ripken. None of those guys ever had a bad
game or weight gain ``blamed'' on being pregnant.
</P>
<P>
   But for a jockey as fiery, as fearless, as unstoppable as Krone
_ a pixie whirling dervish who became racing's all-time winning
female jockey back in 1988 with her 1,205th win and who is the only
woman to ever ride a Triple Crown winner (Colonial Affair at the
Belmont Stakes in 1993) _ the idea that Krone was being denied the
chance to race was blisteringly infuriating.
</P>
<P>
   In that way, all of these athletic luminaries are exactly the
same:
</P>
<P>
   Losing is unthinkable. Giving less than 100 percent is
incomprehensible. Standing in their way, doubting them or telling
them no will only get you in major trouble.
</P>
<P>
   That's why this all stinks. First it was Jordan, who is 99.99
percent sure he won't ever play another NBA game. Then Gretzky and
Krone, who both retired Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   Now Elway is deciding when he'll decide, and Ripken has gone
from baseball's Ironman to the Orioles' disabled list.
</P>
<P>
   If only Dennis Rodman would do us all a favor and take his shoes
and socks _ if he can find them _ and crawl off into the retirement
sunset. His final days in the NBA were far less than glorious,
ending in a pink slip from the fed-up Lakers.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Gretzky got his final assist, feeding Ranger teammate
Brian Leetch for a thunderous Madison Square Garden goal to put a
fitting end to this prolific, artistic scorer's career. Leetch
decided against taking the souvenir goal-scoring stick back onto
the ice.
</P>
<P>
   Krone, in Texas, rode three winners to end her illustrious
career with 3,546 wins, finishing No. 16 among racing's all-time
money winners with $81 million in earnings.
</P>
<P>
   ``The competitive side of me wanted to go out a winner,'' Krone
said at Lone Star Park, adding her reason for retirement was
because ``I'm tired of getting hurt.''
</P>
<P>
   At 35, her body studded with enough surgical screws and hardware
to set off metal detectors from here to Timbuktu, Krone was right
to call it a career. Horses had thrown her and trampled her, and
the industry wasn't that much nicer. Krone said she had nothing
left to prove _ quite a feat for a woman who had to battle
stereotypes in addition to everything else it takes to become one
of the best riders in horse racing.
</P>
<P>
   Like Gretzky, who at 38 knew it was not worth risking his neck
anymore to play the game he elevated and helped bring to the
American masses, Krone's body said she was done.
</P>
<P>
   Like Jordan, Gretzky knew that his all-time greatest status put
a premium on him making the right decision to leave before the game
crushed him.
</P>
<P>
   That is what Elway is grappling with now. In Denver, citizens
are on Elway Alert _ a drill practiced last spring when Elway
deliberated long and hard before deciding to play again in 1998.
Now, though, the end could be for real.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sometimes you've got to listen to your body,'' Elway said
after beating the Falcons in the Super Bowl, winning the MVP award
and limping off to his Miami hotel for a victory cigar.
</P>
<P>
   After seeing Elway and the Broncos execute so well at the Super
Bowl, it was impossible not to suggest Elway should come back for a
chance at a third consecutive Super Bowl. With Bubby Brister at
backup and the Broncos prepared to run an offense to protect and
best use Elway, why not? It would be history.
</P>
<P>
   But that is where Ripken's plight comes into consideration. Why
risk your legacy?
</P>
<P>
   After never missing a start in 2,632 games, Ripken is now on the
disabled list for the first time in his 19-year career. If his
tortoise-like runs to first base and his faltering batting average
weren't enough to signal the end last season, his now very bad back
has seriously diminished Ripken's ability at third base and at the
plate.
</P>
<P>
   The lessons are pretty simple. It takes courage to keep on
playing, year after year, battling injuries and advancing age. It
takes even more courage to walk away, head held high, knowing the
decision was on your terms.

BURKETT FAILS AGAIN; RANGERS MULL OPTIONS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JOHNNY PAUL 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Right-hander John Burkett's days as a member of the
Rangers' rotation appear to be numbered.
</P>
<P>
   Last night's 4-0 defeat to the defending World Series champion
New York Yankees only strengthened the possibility of it occurring
before the Rangers return to Texas from this 13-day, 12-game road
trip.
</P>
<P>
   Burkett, who allowed 10 of 14 batters to reach safely in his
two-inning stint, failed to pitch five innings for the third time
in as many starts this season.
</P>
<P>
   ``You're always thinking about alternatives, but I can't start
talking about it publicly,'' Rangers manager Johnny Oates said.
``I'll do it privately first.''
</P>
<P>
   Right-hander Esteban Loaiza, who pitched himself out of the
rotation with his performance this spring, appears to be on the
verge of regaining his once-lost opportunity.
</P>
<P>
   Loaiza inherited Burkett's third-inning jam and kept the Rangers
within striking distance by surrendering only one run on four hits
in a 3 2/3-inning appearance that included four strikeouts.
</P>
<P>
   ``Loaiza looked like he wanted to change his job description,''
Oates said. ``He had a look in his eyes tonight. He doesn't like
sitting down there \Rin the bullpen\S that long.''
</P>
<P>
   Performance, though, might not be the only reason for what could
be Burkett's exit from the rotation. Burkett experienced tightness
in his right shoulder after his departure and planned to return to
Texas this morning to be examined by Dr. John Conway, the Rangers'
orthopedic consultant.
</P>
<P>
   Among Burkett's many failures last night included two home runs
surrendered to right fielder Paul O'Neill, who entered the game
mired in an 0-for-15 slump. O'Neill's two-run, first-inning home
run came on a 2-0 changeup thrown up in the strike zone.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know whether that was a changeup or a fastball,'' said
Oates, who indicated that there might not be enough difference in
velocity between the two pitches to make the changeup an effective
pitch for Burkett.
</P>
<P>
   O'Neill's first home run gave the Yankees a 2-0 lead, and his
third-inning blast put the Rangers at a three-run disadvantage.
Burkett then surrendered a single to center fielder Bernie
Williams, and an ensuing walk to first baseman Tino Martinez
brought Oates from the dugout.
</P>
<P>
   When asked about the rotation, Oates said: ``... we're still
evaluating that and see where we want to go from there.''
</P>
<P>
   Loaiza, left-hander Eric Gunderson and right-hander Danny
Patterson kept the Rangers in the game with six innings of solid
relief. The lineup, though, mustered only three singles and three
walks against right-hander David Cone (3-0), who never allowed a
runner beyond second base during eight scoreless innings.
</P>
<P>
   The lineup, though, does not present the concern that Burkett
does, and only three options appear to exist:
</P>
<P>
   Leave Burkett in the rotation. That appears unlikely. Burkett
departed Yankee Stadium with an 0-2 record and 12.00 earned-run
average through three starts covering only nine innings, and
opponents are hitting .468 (22-for-47) against him.
</P>
<P>
   Banish Burkett to the bullpen and insert Loaiza into the
rotation. A National League scout who attended last night's game
raved about Loaiza's sinker-slider combination.
</P>
<P>
   ``Those two sliders were as good as you'll ever want to see,''
the scout said of Loaiza's third-inning pitches to catcher Jorge
Posada and left fielder Ricky Ledee. ``He's got a great arm, but
that's why he's such a tease. You know how many great arms have
been in the major leagues over the past five or six years? A lot,
and they don't stick around. They just don't know how to pitch, and
they never learn.''
</P>
<P>
   Release Burkett. The 34-year-old pitcher's $4 million salary
this season is guaranteed, but releasing him would prevent an
option year from vesting. The two-year, $8.45 million contract
extension Burkett signed in April 1997 included options for the
2000 and 2001 seasons.
</P>
<P>
   The Rangers can purchase the option for 2000 for $450,000, but
the contract vests if Burkett makes 30 starts or pitches 195
innings this season. Releasing Burkett, though, likely would force
the Rangers into promoting a pitcher from their minor-league
system.
</P>
<P>
   None of the options appears attractive. The decision, though,
belongs to the Rangers.

DRUG TREATMENT LAW WORKS, SUPREME COURT STUDY SAYS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By MIKE MCCLOY  
 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHOENIX _ The Arizona Supreme Court says hundreds of drug
abusers have been cleaned up and more than $2.5 million in prison
costs have been saved by the state's new medical marijuana law.
</P>
<P>
   But a top aide to Maricopa County Attorney Rick Romley says
Proposition 200 is doing a less effective job than the decade-old
``Do Drugs, Do Time'' diversion program.
</P>
<P>
   Approved by the voters in 1996, Proposition 200 provided more
than $2 million in liquor tax money last fiscal year for treatment.
The law requires probation instead of prison for non-violent first-
and second-time drug offenders.
</P>
<P>
   The Drug Treatment and Education Fund kept 551 people from going
to prison _ saving taxpayers $50 a day for each of them, according
to the report by the Administrative Office of the Courts.
</P>
<P>
   But Barnett Lotstein, special assistant to the county attorney,
said these people would not have gone to prison anyway.
</P>
<P>
   ``No one is sent to prison for mere possession of drugs,''
Lotstein said. ``The savings are illusory.''
</P>
<P>
   The report says another 2,071 people on probation under
provisions other than Proposition 200 received drug treatment
funded by the new law between July 1, 1997, and June 30, 1998.
</P>
<P>
   About 61 percent of the total completed drug treatment
successfully, and they did not disappear, get arrested or have
their probation revoked.
</P>
<P>
   ``It looks like an A-plus to me,'' said Sam Vagenas, director of
Arizonans for Drug Policy Reform, who coordinated the Proposition
200 initiative campaign.
</P>
<P>
   But Lotstein said the 61 percent success rate is questionable.
</P>
<P>
   ``What happened to the other 39 percent?'' he asked. ``Did they
just thumb their nose at the system? Under Proposition 200, they
can't be put in prison.''
</P>
<P>
   Under ``Do Drugs, Do Time,'' those who failed to complete
treatment faced a prison term, Lotstein said. And he claimed a 92
percent success rate, saying only 8 percent were rearrested within
two years of completing that diversion program.
</P>
<P>
   The Supreme Court report, required by Proposition 200, did not
compare programs. Analysts found that more than 77 percent of
participants in drug treatment under Proposition 200 had clean
urine samples when tested. The same percentage made at least one
required co-payment for services.
</P>
<P>
   ``Arizona is in the forefront,'' said Chuck Blanchard, a former
state lawmaker from Phoenix who now is the top attorney for the
White House Office of National Drug Control Policy. He said the
Supreme Court report on Proposition 200 is sound.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is something that was forced on them by Proposition
200,'' Blanchard said. ``The fact that it's a positive report can
be taken seriously.''
</P>
<P>
   Norman Helber, Maricopa County's chief adult probation officer,
said Proposition 200 provides alternatives other than jail or
prison when probationers abuse drugs.
</P>
<P>
   ``We used to tell them, `We can put you in jail in a week or
prison in a month but residential treatment _ it's a six- to
eight-month wait,' '' Helber said.
</P>
<P>
   ``The wealthy went to Betty Ford (treatment center), and the
poor went to jail. Now we've got money for the people who can't pay
for treatment.''
</P>
<P>
   Proposition 200 requires that drug abusers be screened for
psychological problems, literacy and other needs, and that only
proven treatment programs be used. The Supreme Court found that the
recommended treatment was provided in 98 percent of all cases.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're in the driver's seat,'' Helber proclaimed. But he said
Proposition 200 should be expanded to require treatment in prisons.
</P>
<P>
   An estimated 20,000 of the 26,000 inmates in Arizona prisons are
drug abusers, but no law requires treatment, said Gail Rittenhouse
of the Department of Corrections.

STUDENTS ON FRINGE FOUND WAY TO STAND OUT 
</HEADLINE>
  (sw) 
 By BRETT PULLEY   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Rendered virtually invisible among the athletes and popular
classmates who surrounded them, a small group of students at
Columbine High School in Littleton, Colo., found their way out of
anonymity by banding together and dressing in gothic-style clothing
highlighted by long, black coats. They dubbed themselves ``the
trench coat mafia.''
</P>
<P>
   The group was easy to notice among the 1,870 students at the
school, because every day, no matter the weather, they wore their
coats.
</P>
<P>
   According to fellow students and people in the surrounding
neighborhood, the faces of the group's members were often covered
with white makeup and dark eyeliner, and sometimes their tongues
were dripping with hatred for racial minorities and athletes.
</P>
<P>
   ``They were just full of hate,'' said Chris McCaffrey, manager
of Angie's Restaurant, located a few blocks from the school. ``They
weren't particularly feared. They were just a bunch of punks who
kind of hung around the school.''
</P>
<P>
   But investigators now believe that from among the ranks of the
dozen or so students who made up the group were the people
responsible for Tuesday's mass shooting at the high school, which
left an estimated 25 people dead and 20 others wounded. Two
suspects, who had not been identified late Tuesday night, were
found dead among the carnage, and two others students identified by
the Jefferson County Sheriff's Departments as friends of the gunmen
were in custody.
</P>
<P>
   Witnesses said that the two gunmen pulled weapons and explosives
from beneath their black trench coats, and appeared to be aiming
specifically at racial minorities and athletes.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the people in the so-called ``trench coat mafia,''
according to other students, were boys but a few girls also
appeared to be closely associated with them. Many of them were, as
one student put it, ``nerds, geeks and dweebs trying to find some
place to fit in.''
</P>
<P>
   The members of the group kept mostly to themselves, listening to
German rock music and bragging about owning guns. But with their
bizarre style, patterned after the popular Gothic look made famous
by people like the rock musician Marilyn Manson, they stuck out in
Littleton, a middle-class suburb of 41,000 people located southwest
of Denver.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was that kind of devilish, half-dead, half-alive look,''
said Bret, a 16-year-old Columbine sophomore who refused to give
his last name. Asked why the gunmen might have targeted athletes
and popular students, he said, because ``they got their fair share
of being picked on.''
</P>
<P>
   Another student, Nick Zupancic, an 18-year-old senior, agreed
that the members of the group were often scorned by other students.
</P>
<P>
   ``They were outcast,'' Zupancic said as he stood outside Leawood
Elementary School, where some students parents gathered to receive
information on the shootings. ``Kids would make fun of them. They
would rip on them.''

POINT-GUARD POSITION UP IN AIR
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By HOWARD BECK  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   OAKLAND _ Seven games until the postseason and the Lakers aren't
sure who their starting point guard is. Or even who the primary
backup will be.
</P>
<P>
   Derek Fisher started his fourth straight game Tuesday as the
Lakers continued their Preserve Harp campaign with Derek Harper.
And rookie Tyronn Lue again played big minutes off the bench while
Harper rested, a towel pulled firmly over his head.
</P>
<P>
   Harper figures to play a primary role come playoff time,
probably starting again. In the meantime, Rambis has to decide who
will back him up.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's hard to play both of them,'' Rambis said of Lue and
Fisher. ``Foul trouble and certain game-situation needs may dictate
who gets a certain period of time. But it's an adjustment. I'm
gonna have to see and try and make the best adjustment on what
direction I go and who gets most of the minutes.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's real tough to have a three-guy rotation, so we'll
probably have two guys and one guy will be a spot guy who might
come in.''
</P>
<P>
   Rambis also said he wasn't worried about the play of Fisher, the
current starter, who netted no points and no assists in 10 minutes
Monday against Vancouver.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't need my point guards scoring,'' he said. ``Their role
is to initiate our defense, get us into our offense, pass the ball
in our offense. The way we do things, especially the way teams play
us, they may not get assists. . . . They may not be the one who
directly makes the pass. They may be second in line. He gets the
ball to somebody who passes to somebody else . . . and that guy
gets the assist. So I don't look at whether he comes up with zeroes
to determine whether he played a good game or not.''
</P>
<P>
   Fisher has the same outlook.
</P>
<P>
   ``Overall for me, I don't really pay a lot of attention to the
stat sheet, except for assist-to-turnover ratio,'' he said. ``I was
happier (Monday) night than I would have been if I'd scored 20
points. It just felt great to get a win.''
</P>
<P>
   __ Say good-night, Dennis: In the unlikely event any team was
desperate enough to sign ex-Laker Dennis Rodman, he wouldn't be
able to play in the postseason, according to the league.
</P>
<P>
   Under NBA rules, a player waived after midnight March 18 is
ineligible for the playoffs, unless the team that signs him has had
its active roster reduced to eight players due to injury or
illness.
</P>
<P>
   __ Ouch report: Rick Fox missed his second straight game Tuesday
because of a sore right knee suffered at Utah on Saturday. He is
questionable, at best, for tonight's game at Portland.
</P>
<P>
   Harper is recovered from a sore right foot, was available
Tuesday and could have played Monday against Vancouver, team
officials said. &QL;

FORCE WITH COLISEUM

<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ With the deepest apologies to George Lucas and the
Star Wars universe, the National Football League is the real
Phantom Menace in Los Angeles.
</P>
<P>
   The NFL might be a rumor to a generation of youngsters in
greater Los Angeles, but it is all too real and Machiavellian among
adults who recall the league sitting idly by as Georgia Frontiere
and Al Davis shipped their teams out of town. The only NFL fingers
raised over the Rams departure were by owners counting their share
of relocation (i.e., extortion) money.
</P>
<P>
   And among the expansion committee members who visited Los
Angeles this week, one could find Bud Adams (left Houston for
Nashville), Bill Bidwell (left St. Louis for Phoenix), David Modell
(dad Art left Cleveland for Baltimore) and Dolphins owner Wayne
Huizenga (trashed the Florida Marlins).
</P>
<P>
   So it is difficult to accept at face value the league's apparent
new generosity of spirit toward L.A.'s bid for expansion franchise.
</P>
<P>
   The league has rarely sounded as deferential as it did Tuesday
during a press conference to announce it has chosen the Coliseum as
conditional site for an expansion franchise.
</P>
<P>
   For starters, the NFL's support for the Coliseum is a stunning
reversal of fortune. A year ago, NFL owners would have been more
inclined to grant a franchise to Baghdad or Belgrade than the
Coliseum.
</P>
<P>
   In the process of choosing the Coliseum, Tagliabue said the
league is willing to consider a different form of public investment
than the kind it usually prefers _ cash _ in returning to Los
Angeles.
</P>
<P>
   And instead of an auction, he said the league will set a
franchise fee by its May meetings so that the interested parties,
Ed Roski/Eli Broad and Michael Ovitz/Ron Burkle and anyone else who
wants to play, could have a set figure around which to build a
business plan.
</P>
<P>
   These were very impressive words for a group prone to lip
service. It amounts to the first real sign that the league realizes
it needs to have a franchise in Los Angeles.
</P>
<P>
   ``I view today as an exceptionally productive day,'' said
Carolina Panthers owner Jerry Richardson, the chairman of the
expansion committee who played in the Coliseum when he was a
Baltimore Colts lineman. ``We have created the best opportunity to
develop a franchise in Los Angeles.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have an obligation to rekindle interest in the NFL with the
fans here, and an obligation to our sponsors, advertisers and
broadcast partners to bring a successful team back here.
</P>
<P>
   ``But the emphasis is on successful. The fact is, two teams left
this stadium. We can't ignore that and we have to address the
issues we think would prevent us from getting in that situation
again.''
</P>
<P>
   Richardson thus far has been L.A.'s biggest benefactor. He
sounded a clarion last August by informing L.A. that Houston was 95
percent complete in its expansion bid, or 95 percent further along
than anyone in L.A. He's been instrumental since in keeping the
L.A. expansion flag flying to this point.
</P>
<P>
   But he's also blunt about how things need to be done. He made it
clear that L.A. needs to get all remaining priorities in order if
it wants this franchise.
</P>
<P>
   For example, if everyone gets bogged down in a Roski vs. Ovitz
Celebrity Death Match for control of the opportunity, he said, L.A.
will suffer the same fate as St. Louis once did. Factions there
warred about control of a franchise, and the NFL wound up giving an
expansion franchise instead to Richardson. That, of course, begat
the St. Louis Rams option play.
</P>
<P>
   ``Los Angeles would be in a better position if Roski, Broad,
Ovitz and Burkle worked together to resolve the issues,'' he said.
``We're not trying to create competition. We're trying to get a
franchise in L.A. But these are grown men. They'll have to figure
it out.''
</P>
<P>
   For what it's worth, Richardson is in Ovitz's corner. They
walked into the press conference together and went to lunch
together afterwards. While Roski and Broad said they would extend
an invitation for Ovitz to join their group, the NFL might want
Roski and Broad to join Ovitz.
</P>
<P>
   The league seems to like Ovitz's big-picture vision and his
natural affinity for the deal.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know anything about putting the groups together,''
said Ovitz, who withdrew his Carson proposal last week when it
became clear that was the league's wishes. ``I know what we've been
charged with individually. We both had separate meetings (with the
committee) this morning, and we're going to focus on (our own)
business plan.''
</P>
<P>
   The other priority will be a willingness on the part of city
officials to be a bit more creative.
</P>
<P>
   The Coliseum/Roski proposal includes $387 million in public
participation, but most of it comes via the already completed
infrastructure. There's only $40 million of new cash in the
proposal.
</P>
<P>
   Tagliabue sounded accepting of that reality as long as city
officials can find other ways to generate revenue and improve upon
the park at the same time. The league, for example, wants a parking
structure in Exposition Park and other developments on the south
end of the Figueroa corridor.
</P>
<P>
   ``I understand the reality of taxes in California,'' Tagliabue
said. ``In this day and age, there are ways to look at incremental
types of financing, ways to involve a public investment with a
broad public benefit.''
</P>
<P>
   ``There will be no change in our fundamental policy: No new tax
dollars,'' said L.A. City Councilman Mark Ridley-Thomas. ``But we
never said there would be no public dollars. We can invest in our
asset (the Coliseum), if it's defendable, justifiable and
prudent.''
</P>
<P>
   If there's a potential hiccup here, it revolves around the lack
of a relationship between Ovitz and the city. Ridley-Thomas
admitted this is new terrain.
</P>
<P>
   Ovitz said, ``I can work with anybody. Now we have a single site
and a mayor who's involved. We're pretty well teed up.''
</P>
<P>
   And keyed up. L.A. Mayor Richard Riordan showed up for the press
conference with Cardinal Roger Mahoney at his side, invoking Hail
Mary images. Asked why he was on hand, Mahoney said, ``Man does not
live by Dodger dogs alone.'' What a card.
</P>
<P>
   Later, Riordan tossed a football around with some aides. ``The
NFL is the most prestigious club in America,'' he said during the
press conference, ``and we want to be a member of that club.''
</P>
<P>
   Against all odds, the opportunity appears to be there.

   &UR; c. 1999, Houston Chronicle &LR;  &QL; 
FIRST Michael Jordan made the driving layup. He sneaked in from
behind to strip the ball away from the unsuspecting Karl Malone. He
gave Bryon Russell one more head fake and gave the rest of us one
more unforgettable memory, pulling up to the left of the key and
burying the jump shot to win one more championship for the Bulls.
</P>
<P>
   Then he was gone.
</P>
<P>
   Jordan did not officially announce his retirement until after
the stubbornness and ugliness of the NBA lockout had ended in
January. But the truth is, he knew right then and right there on
that night last June in Salt Lake City that the moment had arrived.
</P>
<P>
   Wayne Gretzky did not get the storybook ending he wanted. He
passed to Brian Leetch for one last assist on one last goal, but he
never won another Stanley Cup after he left Edmonton. There were
all those years of falling short in Los Angeles, St. Louis and,
finally, New York.
</P>
<P>
   He reflected on his first year with the Rangers and how he
thought that team had a shot. Now he was going to be left out of
the playoffs for the second year in a row. He was hurt this season
and finished with just nine goals.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought Michael Jordan retired too soon,'' said The Great
One, smiling.
</P>
<P>
   Gretzky did not want to retire too late.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's time,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   And there was nothing his wife, his agent, the Rangers' brass,
NHL commissioner Gary Bettman or his legion of fans could say to
change that.
</P>
<P>
   What the best of them have, as much as all that talent and drive
that resonates inside of them, is a sense of timing. When to make
the basket or the goal or the play that will mean all the
difference when it matters most.
</P>
<P>
   What they too often don't know is when it's time to leave the
stage.
</P>
<P>
   Think of Willie Mays stumbling around in the outfield with the
Mets. Think of Muhammad Ali being pummeled by Larry Holmes in a
portable ring set up in the parking lot of a Las Vegas casino.
</P>
<P>
   Now think of Cal Ripken Jr.
</P>
<P>
   Baseball's iron man has been placed on the disabled list for the
first time in his 19-year career because of a nerve irritation in
his lower back. He is 38 years old and is batting .179 with five
errors in eight games. The man who broke Lou Gehrig's
``unbreakable'' record by playing in 2,632 consecutive games now is
taking cortisone shots and has trouble getting out of his bed in
the morning.
</P>
<P>
   Nobody wants to see this. Nobody wants to see Ripken _ the
epitome of class and determination and working-class ethic _
embarrassed. Nobody wants to see a great player struggle and
stumble to the finish line of a wonderful and historic career.
</P>
<P>
   Wasn't it just yesterday that Ripken was an intimidating
offensive force, driving balls into the gaps, hitting home runs and
delivering the big hits and the clutch RBIs?
</P>
<P>
   Wasn't it only yesterday that Ripken was one of the game's
finest defensive players, gobbling up every ground ball hit in his
direction, chasing pop flies into the shallow outfield and into
foul territory, making those strong and accurate throws?
</P>
<P>
   That Ripken has suddenly vanished like a magician in a puff of
smoke this season. But this disappearing act brings a sense of
sadness rather than awe.
</P>
<P>
   We are loath to push the great ones off to pasture too soon,
always wishing and hoping for one more season, one more game, one
more magical play to remember. Yet it is a tightrope walk where one
trip too many out on the wire can leave us with an entirely
different kind of memory.
</P>
<P>
   Jordan's pride in the image he had built wouldn't let us see him
at anything less than his very best. He could feel the hot breath
of young contenders on his neck. He could hear the footsteps of
time and couldn't bear the thought of them passing him. So he never
gave them the chance. He buried the jumper, buried the Jazz and
left unblemished.
</P>
<P>
   Gretzky could feel himself slowing down, unable to slip all of
the big hits on his willowy body, and he got out before the scars
could turn into fractures or worse. They begged him to make one
last ceremonial trip around the rinks of the NHL. But he wanted to
go out as a player, not a traveling relic on skates, displayed like
the Stanley Cup itself.
</P>
<P>
   Now the clock ticks on Cal Ripken Jr., who already this spring
has had to deal with the death of his father, a difficult emotional
burden at a time when his body and his skills have eroded.
</P>
<P>
   You know what drives him. He needs 117 hits for 3,000 and 16
homers for 400 in a splendid career. But those are just numbers and
no reason to hang on. Like Air Jordan and The Great One, he is
bigger than all that.
</P>
<P>
   As Gretzky said: ``It's time.''
</P>
<P>
   For the iron man to leave with his respect, not our sympathy.

2 IN COLO. SCHOOL SAID TO GUN DOWN AS MANY AS 23, THEN KILL
THEMSELVES
</HEADLINE>

suspects in 2nd graf)  (sw) 
 By JAMES BROOKE

<TEXT>
<P>
   LITTLETON, Colo. _ In the deadliest school massacre in the
nation's history, two young men stormed into a suburban high school
here at lunch time on Tuesday with guns and explosives, killing as
many as 23 students and teachers and wounding at least 20 in a
five-hour siege, the authorities said.
</P>
<P>
   The two students who are believed to have been the gunmen, Eric
Harris and Dylan Klebold, who were students at Columbine High
School, were found dead of self-inflicted gunshot wounds in the
library, said Steve Davis, the spokesman for the Jefferson County
Sheriff's Department.
</P>
<P>
   Beginning about 11:30 a.m., the gunmen, wearing ski masks,
stalked through the school as they fired semiautomatic weapons at
students and teachers and tossed explosives, with one student being
hit nine times in the chest by shrapnel, the authorities said.
Gunshots continued to ring out at the school for hours. One bomb
exploded in the library, officials said, and one in a car outside.
Two more cars were rigged with bombs.
</P>
<P>
   About 3 p.m., hundreds of police officers evacuated the building
and searched for the gunmen. Their bodies and those of several of
their victims appeared to have been wired with explosives.
</P>
<P>
   Sheriff John Stone said, ``It appears to be a suicide mission.''
</P>
<P>
   Davis said that as many as 25 people were dead, ``a mixture of
students and faculty.'' He said that most of the bodies were found
in the school's entrance, the library and the commons cafeteria. No
precise death toll was available.
</P>
<P>
   Kaleb Newberry, 16, said: ``I was in class and one teacher came
in and basically told us to run for our lives, I saw a girl maybe
five paces behind me fall. She was shot in the leg, but a teacher
helped her.''
</P>
<P>
   Students said the gunmen were part of a group of misfits who
called themselves the trench coat mafia, which expressed disdain
for racial minorities and athletes. Members of the group found
their way out of anonymity at the school by banning together,
dressing in dark gothic-style clothing including long black coats.
They became easy to notice among the 1,870 students at the school,
since every day, regardless of the weather, they wore their coats.
</P>
<P>
   On Tuesday, the gunmen appeared to aim at minority members and
athletes at the 1,800-student school, as well as peers who had
poked fun at the group in the past.
</P>
<P>
   School officials had had no reports of trouble from the
suspects, Davis said.
</P>
<P>
   Some victims were forced to wait inside the school for rescue.
By early evening, bodies had not been removed because of the crime
scene investigation and the possible presence of explosives, a
spokesman for the Jefferson County Sheriff's Department said.
</P>
<P>
   Davis said at a news conference on Tuesday night that two other
students at the school, thought to be friends of the gunmen, were
in custody for questioning in connection with the shooting.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can't really go in and do this kind of damage without a
lot of preparation.'' Davis said, ``without a lot of ammunition and
apparently some type of bombs.''
</P>
<P>
   Fourteen-year-old Katie Corona, said she was trapped in a
classroom with her teacher and about 30 classmates for hours.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought I was going to die,'' she said. ``I really didn't
think I was going to make it. We would hear shots, then we heard
crying. We had no clue what was going on.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Everyone around me got shot and I begged him for 10 minutes
not to shoot me,'' one young woman, who was not identified, said on
Tuesday night in an interview broadcast on the Cable News Network.
``And he just put the gun in my face and started laughing and
saying it was all because people were mean to him last year.''
</P>
<P>
   Another student, who said she heard more gunshots while hiding
in the closet with a teacher and some friends, said she kept
thinking to herself, ``This can't be happening to our school.''
</P>
<P>
   ``You should be safe at school,'' added a second young woman,
who also was not identified. ``This should be a safe place.''
</P>
<P>
   The families of those killed were being notified on Tuesday
night at Leawood Elementary School, where students and parents had
gathered.
</P>
<P>
   The mass shooting was the first at an American school during
this academic year, but revived memories of similar tragedies that
struck six different communities last year and set off national
alarms about teen-age violence. Four girls and a teacher were shot
to death and 10 people were wounded during a false fire alarm at a
middle school in Jonesboro, Ark., last March.
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton immediately dispatched a crisis-response team
to aid the school community and the victim's families.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't know yet all the how's or why's of this tragedy;
perhaps we will never fully understand it,'' the president said in
a nationally televised news conference just before 8 p.m. ``St.
Paul reminds us that we all see things in life darkly, that we only
partly understand what is happening.''
</P>
<P>
   He added, ``We do know that we must do more to reach out to our
children and teach them to express their anger and to resolve their
conflicts with words, not weapons.''
</P>
<P>
   A sunny spring day turned into a bloody nightmare for this
suburb of 35,000 people southwest of Denver, as ambulances ferried
the injured from the high school, past tennis courts, a baseball
diamond and a packed student parking lot.
</P>
<P>
   ``I hope we can all pull together, because we will need all our
strengths,'' Jane Hammond, Jefferson County superintendent of
schools, said on Tuesday night. The blood banks in the Denver area
have been overwhelmend with calls from donors. On Tuesday night,
there were at least three church vigils for the dead and injured.

</P>
<P>
   Just before 8 p.m., Lisa Appleton, 16, a sophomore, waited in
front of the Leawood school for news of her best friend, Julie
Toms, who had been missing since students began leaving the school.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can't even feel it,'' she said. ``There's no way to know
whether she's dead or alive.''
</P>
<P>
   About 3 p.m., SWAT teams of police officers used a fire truck
and an armored car to get close to the building, dozens of students
raced out of the two-story building, some slipping in the mud,
others holding up their hands in the air or behind their heads.
Police said they feared that the gunmen would try to escape by
mingling with the trapped students.
</P>
<P>
   One student, bloodied from an injury, broke out a second-story
window, and climbed down into the hands of the police.
</P>
<P>
   As police officers established a wide perimeter around the beige
school, students and school workers gathered on nearby tree-lined
streets and told of the chaos and horror inside the building.
</P>
<P>
   As fire alarms rang in the halls, students who had seen the
gunmen trampled each other to get out of the building, running
through one exit where three bodies lay on a staircase.
</P>
<P>
   Trapped inside, others took refuge in classrooms, bathrooms and
a choir room, frantically barricading doors with desks and file
cabinets.
</P>
<P>
   One cafeteria worker who barricaded herself in a woman's
bathroom said, ``We could hear them blowing the heck out of the
place.''
</P>
<P>
   A student, Jonathan Ladd, said, ``I heard gunshots going off,
bullets ricocheting off lockers.''
</P>
<P>
   The trench coat mafia is a small band of about a dozen juniors
and seniors at Columbine who are easily recognized yet little
feared, according to people who live in the neighborhood near the
school. Regardless of the weather, they favor long black coats and
the Gothic look popularized by the rock singer Marilyn Manson,
neighbors said. Some even wear white pancake makeup and dark
eyeliner, one student said.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was that devilish, half-dead, half-alive look,'' said Bret,
a 16-year-old sophomore who spoke on the condition only his first
name be used.
</P>
<P>
   The group often gathered in the cafeteria after school. Chris
McCaffrey, manager of Angie's Restaurant a few blocks from
Columbine, said that residents had known about the group for about
five years, and that no one considered it a threat.
</P>
<P>
   ``Mostly it was just kids who nobody wanted to have anything to
do with,'' McCaffrey said. ``They weren't particularly feared. They
were just a bunch of punks who kind of hang around the school.''
</P>
<P>
   Students said the group was mostly boys, but that some girls
appeared to be closely associated with it. One student described
the group as ``nerds, geeks and dweebs trying to find someplace to
fit in.''
</P>
<P>
   Bret suggested the mafia might have targeted athletes out of
resentment for their own lack of popularity and success at school.
</P>
<P>
   The students ``weren't really accepted as younger kids and as
they got older they were accepted by this group,'' Bret said.
``They got their fair share of being picked on. I could understand
that they might have targeted some of the more popular kids.''
</P>
<P>
   David Mesch, another student, who was searching for his mother
who works for the school, said, ``They were wearing masks; they
were members of the trench coat mafia.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton said tonight that he was ``profoundly shocked and
saddened by the tragedy on Tuesday in Littleton.''
</P>
<P>
   In an age when cellular telephones are increasingly common among
high school students, several trapped students called television
stations when they could not get through on 911 lines.
</P>
<P>
   ``I hear a couple of gunshots, people running up and down,'' a
student said in a frightened whisper to KUSA-TV, a Denver
television station. Identifying himself only as James, he added,
``There are a bunch of kids downstairs, I can hear them crying.''
</P>
<P>
   Aware that the gunmen might be watching on a classroom
television set, he said, ``I am staying upstairs,'' and then hung
up.
</P>
<P>
   In a state with a relatively low crime rate, the siege after the
shootings was broadcast live by Denver television stations, without
commercial breaks all afternoon. Broadcast and cable networks
turned to local affiliates for help with their coverage.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a cultural virus,'' Gov. Bill Owens of Colorado said
before hurrying to the scene. Noting that he felt particularly
affected by the tragedy because his 16-year-old daughter goes to a
suburban Denver high school, he said, ``We have to ask ourselves
what kind of children we are raising.''
</P>
<P>
   At the White House, the president said the nation should focus
on praying for the victims' families and others at the school. He
said that Attorney General Janet Reno was closely monitoring the
situation, and that he had spoken on Tuesday afternoon with Owens
and Patricia Holloway, the county commissioner, whose comments he
shared with the nation.
</P>
<P>
   In midafternoon, police officers briefly detained three young
white men who wore camouflaged pants and black jackets, next to the
high school. After they were released, the men said they knew the
gunmen inside the high school. Emblazoned on the back of one man's
jacket were the words, ``Ban Religion'' and a red-painted stop sign
printed over a cross.

   PRIZREN, KOSOVO _ The first Kosovo Albanian towns we came to
were so peaceful. There were small mosques gleaming in the morning
sun, farmers tilling with oxen, housewives coming out of a
supermarket, a local bus. Forests stretched down to the roadside.
</P>
<P>
   Was this really the bandit land that Colonel Stojanovic had
warned us about? ``We have just entered the danger zone where we
can be targeted from the air,'' the Yugoslav officer had told us.
``And we shouldn't exclude a possible terrorist attack.''
</P>
<P>
   Then we noticed a group of Serb special police looking upwards
and pointing. A faint puff of white smoke drifted over the fields,
then another. At one point I heard NATO jets racing through the
firmament, though I couldn't see them.
</P>
<P>
   And still we passed those dainty, undamaged homes. There were
Albanians in the streets, hanging out washing on clothes lines,
taking coffee in the shop at the corner.
</P>
<P>
   It was the Kosovo Liberation Army that absorbed the mind of
Colonel Stojanovic and the four Serb cops in the blue and white
police car in front of our bus.
</P>
<P>
   According to Serb officials, the KLA had recently made
incursions from Albania, attacking Serb villages and burning Serb
homes.
</P>
<P>
   The local cops wore colored cloth on their right shoulders, red
in the first towns we passed through, red and pale blue in the
next, and so on.
</P>
<P>
   The KLA have stolen so many police uniforms that the Serbs now
have to color code their men to prevent KLA imposters dressed as
policemen driving into town for a shoot-out.
</P>
<P>
   But after an hour's driving, there wasn't much left for the
policemen to patrol. First one Albanian village, then a second
appeared around the hills, a house burned there, a dynamited
shop-front spilling into the road, a mosque with scorch marks at
the top of its minaret.
</P>
<P>
   Then we turned a corner and saw the hills on fire. From forests
and towns more than 10 miles away, smoke streamed into the sky.
Each Albanian village was more damaged than the last, each more
deserted.
</P>
<P>
   Looking at this place was like trying to read a book in a
strange language.
</P>
<P>
   A row of seven brand new homes lay beside a newly ploughed
field, bright red roofs above gleaming balconies. The fourth house
had been burned out; the rest were untouched, ready for proud new
homeowners.
</P>
<P>
   A street of looted shops was followed by farms with women and
children in the yards. Some Albanians worked the fields. I caught
sight of a young boy and a middle-aged man sitting on a farm gate
in the sun. It was a landscape without coherence.
</P>
<P>
   The Serbian journalists on the bus beside me chatted among
themselves as this frightening countryside bounced past us.
</P>
<P>
   In valleys far to the north, curtains of smoke streamed upwards
_ there must have been five or six square miles of land ablaze _
while sparkling rivers wound south towards the snow-white mountains
of Macedonia.
</P>
<P>
   Did the Serbian journalists not see the fires and the burned
homes? We passed a newly torched Albanian house blazing away in the
hot sunshine. Still no heads turned.
</P>
<P>
   At the scene of the NATO air strikes which massacred dozens of
Kosovo Albanians last week, two buses passed us, crammed with
Kosovo Albanian women and children, driving at speed through the
dust, frightened faces at the windows.
</P>
<P>
   Again, the Serbian journalists paid no attention. Their interest
was focused on the scene of slaughter and wrecked tractors.
</P>
<P>
   When we stopped for a new police escort, some men beside the bus
were calmly loading a truck with hundreds of bottles of orange
juice from an Albanian warehouse. At one point a police car arrived
and the occupants loaded the trunk with bottles of Coke. It's
thirsty work being a Serbian cop in Kosovo. Especially, it seems,
when the towns are empty.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier in our journey, as we drove through Pozeranje, we
suddenly caught sight of a group of 200 exhausted, fearful
Albanians, old men and women holding plastic sacks of clothes. They
must have been waiting for one of those buses heading for the
border.
</P>
<P>
   It was their moment of catastrophe, the hour of leaving their
homes forever. In front of me, a Serb journalist puffed away on his
pipe.
</P>
<P>
   On the high, back road to Prizren, we climbed into the
mountains, and the Serb villages. Some were intact, many others
destroyed, every Serb house systematically set ablaze, the mountain
homes gutted.
</P>
<P>
   The KLA, Madeleine Albright's friends _ the men whose activities
are recorded with approval by NATO press spokesmen in Brussels _
had done this.
</P>
<P>
   Serbs ``ethnically cleansed,'' It makes an odd headline. It has
not been the stuff of newspaper reports. This was very definitely
not CNN country.
</P>
<P>
   Yet it is the Kosovo Albanians in their tens of thousands who
remain the far greater victims. It is they who are being
dispossessed on an epic scale.
</P>
<P>
   Further down the road, when we passed another abandoned village
with a single, burning house, I looked at the Serbian journalists
again. Still they surveyed the road with equanimity.
</P>
<P>
   Well, not quite all of them. In front of me, my wife Lara _ a
correspondent for the Irish Times _ noticed that one Serbian woman
journalist was wiping away a tear. Then the woman began writing a
short letter in the Serbian language in her notebook. She handed it
to Lara.
</P>
<P>
   ``You'll find someone to translate this for you,'' it said at
the top, and continued: ``Dear Lara, There are a large number of us
who do not agree that the Kosovo/Metohija problem should be solved
in this way. Where are the people? Why are their houses and cattle
abandoned? Where are the children? Why are they being punished? All
the children in the world are the same, they should be allowed to
play and laugh.
</P>
<P>
   ``God, when will the innocent stop suffering, regardless of
which nation, which religious confession and which race they belong
to?''
</P>
<P>
   In this awful, sinister landscape, it read like the voice of
God. &QL;

   WASHINGTON _ The cherry and almond trees are in full bloom; the
lawns are freshly mown; the flower beds are ablaze with color and
the streets swept spotless.
</P>
<P>
   Arrayed in its springtime best, Washington is engrossed in final
preparations for its last big show before the Millennium.
</P>
<P>
   This coming weekend, the city that styles itself the capital of
the free world will host its largest diplomatic summit ever: the
50th birthday party of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization
(NATO).
</P>
<P>
   More than 1,500 delegates and 3,000 reporters are expected in
town on Friday, and that means gridlock on the grand scale. ``Think
flags. Think motorcades. Think tight security and traffic
detours,'' warned the Washington Post. But traffic is now the least
of this city's worries.
</P>
<P>
   This party of parties was planned to celebrate ``the most
successful military alliance in history.''
</P>
<P>
   In the spirit of post-Cold-War harmony, it was conceived as a
gigantic peace-fest in which everyone could join, even erstwhile
enemies like Russia. Every martial symbol was to be muted and shorn
of menace.
</P>
<P>
   With the first NATO missiles fired on Serbia, that spirit
evaporated. For the first time since its formation, NATO was at
war, and it will probably still be at war in four days' time, when
the Air Force Ones of 43 countries disgorge their delegates in the
Washington suburbs.
</P>
<P>
   Worse, the war is not going as smoothly as a late 20th century
high-tech war should: it is messy and risks becoming still messier.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is not going to be quick, easy or neat,'' warned U.S.
Defense Secretary William Cohen last week; casualties are ``a
probability.''
</P>
<P>
   Yet it has to be won, for the credibility of the alliance is now
on the line. If its 19 members, led by the sole remaining
superpower, cannot impose their will on the recalcitrant rump of
Yugoslavia, what price NATO's survival?
</P>
<P>
   It could so easily have been otherwise. If Yugoslav President
Slobodan Milosevic had signed the Rambouillet accord or capitulated
after a short, sharp dose of air strikes, peace through strength
backed by force could have been maintained.
</P>
<P>
   At a stroke of Milosevic's pen, NATO would have been vindicated;
the fanfares could sound and the party begin.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a test of the NATO of the 21st century,'' said U.S.
Secretary of State Madeleine Albright when the war was hardly one
week old. She meant it optimistically.
</P>
<P>
   Now, with more than a million people displaced _ the very people
that alliance force was supposed to protect _ several fatal errant
strikes by NATO planes, and the stability of neighboring states in
question, celebration looks inappropriate, if not downright
perverse.
</P>
<P>
   Can NATO really feast, as its forces fight and Kosovo starves?
</P>
<P>
   The organizers are now scrambling to recast an exultant festival
of peace as a low-key council of war.
</P>
<P>
   The fly-past has been cancelled. The champagne banquet at the
White House will be a working dinner; the ``black-tie'' instruction
has been replaced by ``lounge suits.'' The commemorative stamps due
to be issued by the U.S. Post Office have been put on hold.
</P>
<P>
   Absences, though, are harder to disguise. The celebrations had
been stage-managed to ensure that Russia and its former satellites
would feel welcome.
</P>
<P>
   The watchwords were ``partnership'' and ``inclusion.'' There was
to be no hint that the Cold War had a winner, and that winner was
NATO.
</P>
<P>
   To that end, the Czech Republic, Hungary and Poland were quietly
received into the alliance in advance, at a quiet ceremony two
hours' flying time from Washington. The venue, President Harry
Truman's memorial library at Independence, in Missouri, was so
fitting, but oh so discreet.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps the greatest diplomatic achievement of Bill Clinton's
presidency _ the return of Central Europe to the West _ took place
without him.
</P>
<P>
   Russia was to be an honored guest _ perhaps the most honored
guest _ at NATO's party, its presence the embodiment of President
Clinton's oft-chanted ideal of ``One Europe, whole and free.''
</P>
<P>
   The hope that a tamed Russia would be the central symbol of a
new post-Cold War Europe, however, was dashed to smithereens when
the first bombs fell. Russia's special relationship with the Serbs
precluded it.
</P>
<P>
   Russian Prime Minister Yevgeny Primakov, who was on his way to
Washington for his twice-yearly talks with Vice-President Al Gore,
turned his plane around mid-Atlantic and went back to Moscow.
</P>
<P>
   Within hours, Russia changed its mind about its invitation to
NATO's party. Whether Russia or NATO is the bigger loser may be
disputed, but the ``One Europe'' image so craved by Washington has
been lost.
</P>
<P>
   Stoically, the Americans insist that the show will go on. But as
refugees continue to flee and the bombs continue to fall, even a
subdued summit no longer seems such a good idea. &QL; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; (175-WORD OPTIONAL TRIM BEGINS HERE AT 825) &LR;  &QC; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   In Washington, however, the preparations have long gained a
momentum of their own. The White House wants to demonstrate that
Democrats, too, can put on a real show _ and, as a bonus, launch
Vice-President Gore into the global big time.
</P>
<P>
   The city's new mayor, Anthony Williams, has a Stakhanovite
program in train to spruce up civic buildings, relay pavements and
resurface roads. Booked to capacity, the city's premier hotels are
all double-checking their security routines.
</P>
<P>
   Those with perhaps the biggest stake, though, are the commercial
sponsors. This being the United States, a dozen companies have paid
$250,000 each for a place on the ``host committee,'' with
guaranteed places at the top tables for their executives,
exhibition space for their promotions and the chance to court new
customers over cocktails.
</P>
<P>
   With the likes of Ford, General Motors, Eastman Kodak and
Nextel, not to mention the missile producer, Raytheon, holding
tickets, it would be a brave president indeed who called the whole
party off. &QL; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; (END OF OPTIONAL TRIM. STORY CONCLUDES) &LR;  &QC; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Which is not to say that nothing is being done. Behind the
scenes, this juggernaut of a multinational get-together is being
slowly cranked around.
</P>
<P>
   The agenda, that has been essentially fixed for months, is
undergoing a total rewrite. The focus could be on the German peace
plan, or the French-inspired ``stability plan'' for southeast
Europe, or just on ``How do we get out of this mess?''
</P>
<P>
   In any event, ethereal discussions of NATO's ``Strategic
Concept'' _ its much-vaunted (and much-contested) security
blueprint for global peace in the next century _ are being
relegated to the sidelines.
</P>
<P>
   It is not just that the real engagement over Kosovo is so much
more urgent than doctrine and theory, it is that Kosovo has
answered two of the points most at issue inside the alliance.
</P>
<P>
   Should NATO action require a U.N. mandate? Kosovo did not
receive one. Should NATO act outside its national boundaries? It
just has. Will it act in future outside the North Atlantic area? It
must hope for the time being that the question does not arise: the
alliance has its work cut out as it is.
</P>
<P>
   As representatives of 43 countries prepare to meet in Washington
this week, NATO's immediate priorities are to keep the alliance
together and prevent the century ending as it began, with war in
the Balkans.

   WASHINGTON _ The cherry and almond trees are in full bloom; the
lawns are freshly mown; the flower beds are ablaze with color and
the streets swept spotless.

<P>
   Arrayed in its springtime best, Washington is engrossed in final
preparations for its last big show before the Millennium.

   &UR; c. 1999, Houston Chronicle &LR;  &QL; 
CHICAGO _ Maybe the drenching rains that soaked Wrigley Field on
Tuesday night were like a cleansing rinse.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe they were the splash of cold water in the face, the
wake-up shower that revives the senses, after two weeks of the
Astros walking through the season in an inexplicable fog.
</P>
<P>
   The Astros' bats certainly were there through the first 12
games, but big-time production in the clutch like the Astros knew
in 1998 had yet to show itself. The Astros entered this series
against the division-rival Cubs a mediocre 6-6, mostly because even
though they led the league in hitting at .292, they ranked 15th of
16 NL teams in runs scored.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's what has killed us,'' said hitting coach Tom McCraw.
``Our guys are in shape to hit, and they're ready to hit, and
they've hit the ball. But we're not getting the big hits with
runners on base. That's been the difference.''
</P>
<P>
   Tuesday night, it was the difference again. This time it was for
the better. This time it was for a 10-4 win that lifted the Astros
back above .500 and looked an awful lot like 1998 revisited.
</P>
<P>
   There were clutch singles, doubles and a big two-run triple by
Carl Everett, who went 3-for-5 and yet again showed signs of
building his way to a huge year. There were impressive
hit-and-runs, aggressive baserunning and offensive production from
every spot on Larry Dierker's lineup card but Craig Biggio leading
off.
</P>
<P>
   Altogether there were 16 hits and 19 Astros reaching base. Six
players scored. The Astros scored at least one run in six innings.
</P>
<P>
   It easily was the most impressive offensive output of the season
for the Astros and included the kind of decisive heavy-hitting
rally in the seventh that mostly had been missing in 1999.
</P>
<P>
   It was like a cold plunge, a trip back to the kind of timely
hitting and overwhelming offensive efforts that helped the Astros
to 48 come-from-behind victories a year ago.
</P>
<P>
   While this one might not have been a comeback win on the
scorecard, it was indeed a game that was in doubt into the late
innings. And it was impressive in the way the win came against a
pitcher who had mastered Astros bats in the past.
</P>
<P>
   The last time the Astros faced Cubs starter Jon Lieber, he gave
up five hits and no walks and struck out six in eight innings of a
2-1 Cubs win in the season's third game.
</P>
<P>
   This time, eight baserunners reached for the Astros in the first
four innings against Lieber. The 5-1 lead in the fifth looked
formidable, especially with Lieber chased to the showers and Astros
starter Jose Lima keeping the Cubs quiet.
</P>
<P>
   But then, even as Lima refused to groove a pitch to his
Dominican countryman, Sammy Sosa, it didn't matter. Sosa drove a
huge home run onto Waveland Avenue _ Sosa's third of the season _
sparking a three-run fifth inning that brought the Cubs back to
within 5-4.
</P>
<P>
   It was here where the Astros' bats might have most resembled
last season's big run: They were clutch. And unrelenting.
</P>
<P>
   Even as the famed Wrigley wind blew in hard from right field and
the rains that delayed this one nearly 1{ hours returned, the
Astros built a cushion and then made sure Dierker slept easy.
</P>
<P>
   Richard Hidalgo crushed a home run over the left-field wall and
rookie Mitch Meluskey followed with his first major-league homer in
the seventh, giving the Astros a three-run lead.
</P>
<P>
   In the ninth, three runs came home, with a pair of doubles by
Ken Caminiti and Hidalgo and an RBI single by Everett the big
blows.
</P>
<P>
   Who knows if such an overwhelming display again will become the
Astros' constant. But after two weeks of saying the big hits would
come, hoping they would come, they finally did.
</P>
<P>
   After talking about it being only a matter of time for such
phenomenal talents as Hidalgo and Meluskey to show how impressive
they are at the plate, they were. Hidalgo was 3-for-5 with a
double, a home run, two RBIs and two runs scored. Meluskey was
3-for-4 with a home run and two RBIs.
</P>
<P>
   It was an Astros downpour. If they keep it up, the forecast for
the division might be for even more Astros reign.

WALKS RULE IN WIN OVER BRAVES
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By BRIAN DOHN  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ You could hear your Little League coach screaming
like it was some kind of a never-ending dream.
</P>
<P>
   ``A walk's as good as a hit. A walk's as good as a hit.'' He
would drill it home.
</P>
<P>
   Had he been at Dodger Stadium on Tuesday he may have revised his
thoughts. The Atlanta Braves and Los Angeles Dodgers took turns
playing attendant of the merry-go-round on the base paths.
</P>
<P>
   The teams combined to walk 19 batters before the Dodgers finally
beat the Braves 5-4 in a game that was lapped by a pair of snails
racing.
</P>
<P>
   Nobody was huffin' and puffin' from running the base paths.
Instead, there was a nice, brisk walk. To that point, Dodger
pitchers walked 11. Braves pitchers issued eight bases on balls.
</P>
<P>
   Darren Dreifort (3-0) recorded the win and Jeff Shaw recorded
the last four outs for his fourth save. Kevin Millwood (1-2) took
the loss. Dodgers shortstop Jose Vizcaino went 4 for 4, Devon White
hit a two-run homer and Adrian Beltre had a single and walked three
times.
</P>
<P>
   Dodgers manager Davey Johnson used a trio of pitchers to work
out of a jam in the eighth. Walt Weiss led off with a single, stole
second and moved to third on a ground out against right-hander
Jamie Arnold, making his big league debut. Onan Masaoka then got
Gerald Williams to line out to shortstop with the infield playing
in and Shaw retired Bret Boone on a line drive to third.
</P>
<P>
   For the second straight start, Dreifort was nearly unhittable.
This time for six innings. In fact, he was one-hittable. The only
Atlanta batter to get a hit was Randall Simon. He singled twice,
meaning it's the second straight time Dreifort's allowed two hits
in his start.
</P>
<P>
   But unlike his seven-inning masterpiece against Randy Johnson
and the Arizona Diamondbacks last week, it wasn't very simple for
Dreifort.
</P>
<P>
   He's spent a career with baffling stuff and baffling managers
with control problems. Simon's were the only hits, but Dreifort
frustratingly walked a career-high nine Braves, three of which
followed a Simon single on both occasions. One was even to
Millwood, his wild counterpart, and led to the walking of Otis
Nixon with the bases loaded as Atlanta took a 2-0 lead in the
second inning.
</P>
<P>
   Millwood was worse. He was wild and hittable, not to mention
nearly unwatchable. In 3 1/3 innings he allowed six hits, walked
four and gave up four runs.
</P>
<P>
   He walked Eric Karros to lead off the second and then grooved a
1-0 pitch that White hit over the right field fence. White's third
homer of the season tied things 2-2, but the walk-of-life
continued.
</P>
<P>
   White drew a leadoff walk in the fourth, and keeping with the
night's theme Adrian Beltre also walked. Vizcaino then singled to
right to load the bases, and after Dreifort struck out, Eric Young
doubled over the head of center fielder Andruw Jones as the Dodgers
took a 4-2 lead.
</P>
<P>
   Lefty Mike Remlinger relieved and got out of the inning, but the
walk-a-thon continued. He opened the fifth inning by walking Raul
Mondesi, who eventually scored on Jose Vizcaino's single to right.
It put the Dodgers up 5-2.
</P>
<P>
   It didn't end there. In a night of inactivity at the plate for
the Braves, Dreifort kept the base paths lively. Simon singled to
right with one out in the sixth. The next time a Braves batter hit
a ball in fair territory, the bases were loaded, Dreifort was on
the bench and Atlanta cut the Dodgers' lead to 5-4. Dreifort was
pulled after he walked pinch-hitter Keith Lockhart with the bases
loaded. It was his ninth walk, and was enough for Johnson, who
opted for Arnold. Of the 104 pitches Dreifort made, 49 were
strikes.
</P>
<P>
   Arnold, whose contract was purchased earlier in the day from
Triple-A Albuquerque, relieved and made his major league debut by
walking Nixon to force in another run. However, Arnold got Boone to
ground back to the mound for a force out at home and Chipper Jones
flied to center to end the inning. &UR; !dlim!!end!

STUDENTS ON THE FRINGE FOUND WAY TO STAND OUT
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Subs for updating, rewriting throughout)   (sw) 
 By BRETT PULLEY   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Rendered virtually invisible among the athletes and popular
classmates who surrounded them, a small group of students at
Columbine High School in Littleton, Colo., found their way out of
anonymity by banding together and dressing in Gothic-style clothing
highlighted by long, black coats.
</P>
<P>
   They dubbed themselves ``the trench coat mafia.''
</P>
<P>
   The group was easy to notice among the 1,870 students at the
school, because every day, no matter the weather, they wore their
coats.
</P>
<P>
   Fellow students and people in the surrounding neighborhood said
the faces of the group's members were often covered with white
makeup and dark eyeliner, and sometimes their tongues were dripping
with hatred for racial minorities and athletes.
</P>
<P>
   ``They were just full of hate,'' said Chris McCaffrey, manager
of Angie's Restaurant, a few blocks from the school. ``They weren't
particularly feared. They were just a bunch of punks who kind of
hung around the school.''
</P>
<P>
   But investigators now believe that among the dozen or so
students in the group were the people responsible for Tuesday's
mass shooting at the high school, which left an estimated 25 people
dead and at least 20 others wounded. Two suspects were identified
by the Jefferson County Sheriff's Department as Eric Harris, 18,
and Dylan Klebold, 17, who were found dead among the carnage.
</P>
<P>
   Two other people were being held in custody.
</P>
<P>
   A police officer answered the telephone late on Tuesday night at
the home of Klebold in the Deer Creek Mesa neighborhood. He said
the family was not at home and he refused to comment further.
</P>
<P>
   Witnesses said that the two gunmen pulled weapons and explosives
from beneath their black trench coats, and appeared to be aiming
specifically at racial minorities and athletes.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the people in the trench coat mafia, other students
said, were boys but a few girls also appeared to be closely
associated with them.
</P>
<P>
   Many of them were, as one student put it, ``nerds, geeks and
dweebs trying to find some place to fit in.''
</P>
<P>
   The members of the group kept mostly to themselves, listening to
German rock music and bragging about owning guns. But with their
bizarre style, patterned after the popular Gothic look made famous
by people like the rock musician Marilyn Manson, they stuck out in
Littleton, a middle-class suburb of 41,000 people southwest of
Denver.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was that kind of devilish, half-dead, half-alive look,''
said Bret, a 16-year-old Columbine sophomore who refused to give
his last name. Asked why the gunmen might have targeted athletes
and popular students, he said, because ``they got their fair share
of being picked on.''
</P>
<P>
   Another student, Nick Zupancic, an 18-year-old senior, agreed
that the members of the group were often scorned by other students.
</P>
<P>
   ``They were outcast,'' Zupancic said as he stood outside Leawood
Elementary School, where some students parents gathered to receive
information on the shootings. ``Kids would make fun of them. They
would rip on them.''

 By CARLTON THOMPSON  
 c. 1999, Houston Chronicle  
CHICAGO _ Enough rain fell in the vicinity of Wrigley Field on
Tuesday night to fill a wishing well, and this may have qualified
as a good thing for the Astros, considering the way their luck has
gone.
<TEXT>
<P>
   Most of what they might have wished for came to pass in a 10-4
victory over the Chicago Cubs that evened the Astros' record
against National League Central opponents at 5-5.
</P>
<P>
   Offensive efficiency would rank at the top of the wish list for
the Astros, who entered Tuesday's game as the NL's top hitting team
but ranked next to last in scoring. Tuesday's scoring outburst was
a season high, and it came on the heels of an eight-run effort in
their previous game.
</P>
<P>
   Big contributions by struggling youngsters Richard Hidalgo and
Mitch Meluskey no doubt answered a prayer or two in the Astros'
clubhouse. Hidalgo (batting .239 for the season) was 3-for-5 with
two RBIs and his team-leading third homer. Meluskey (.259) was
3-for-4 with the first home run of his fledgling big-league career.
</P>
<P>
   ``We got a lot of offense from some guys who haven't been
hitting, and that was good to see,'' Astros manager Larry Dierker
said. ``It was great to see them finally break out. Maybe that will
give them some confidence and they can build from this.''
</P>
<P>
   No Astros wish list would be complete without hopes for a solid
effort from the bullpen. Scott Elarton, who notched his first save,
extended his scoreless-innings streak to nine, but the more
pleasant pair of innings came from struggling righthander Brian
Williams, who matched zeros with Elarton.
</P>
<P>
   Dierker planned to use Williams only in the sixth inning, but he
pitched so well that the skipper decided to give him the seventh
inning, too. That allowed Dierker to use Elarton over the final two
innings and save closer Billy Wagner for another day.
</P>
<P>
   ``Williams did a great job,'' Dierker said. ``We needed that
bridge to get us to our late-inning guys, and he did a great job.''
</P>
<P>
   In fact, Williams pitched like one of those ``late-inning
guys,'' retiring each of the six batters he faced.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think they needed to see that from me,'' said Williams, who
lowered his ERA from 6.43 to 5.00. ``So far, those situations have
only been for Elarton, Jay (Powell) and Wagner. Maybe they'll have
a little more confidence in me now.''
</P>
<P>
   As is often the case after a rain delay _ the start time was
pushed back by an hour and 17 minutes _ neither starting pitcher
was particularly sharp. Jose Lima (2-1) earned his second victory
with a laborious 105-pitch effort that barely got him through five
innings.
</P>
<P>
   The last time the Astros faced Cubs starter Jon Lieber, they
looked as dazed and confused as a punch-drunk fighter, managing
just five baserunners in eight innings on April 8. On Tuesday, they
delivered one body blow after another and eventually knocked out
Lieber in the fifth inning.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've never worried about our offense,'' Astros hitting
instructor Tom McCraw said. ``We've got guys who are proven run
producers, and it's just a matter of time before we put it all
together. It's coming around.''
</P>
<P>
   Astros center fielder Carl Everett was 3-for-5 with three RBIs,
while Jeff Bagwell and Ken Caminiti each had two hits in the
Astros' 16-hit attack. Everett, who has hit safely in 12 of the
Astros' 13 games, led off the second inning with a single and
scored on Ricky Gutierrez's 500th career hit _ a broken-bat single
to left.
</P>
<P>
   Lieber (2-1), who had walked one batter in 16 innings prior to
Tuesday, issued a one-out free pass to Bill Spiers in the third
inning, and the Astros made Lieber pay for the rare walk. Spiers
advanced to third on Bagwell's double and scored on a groundout by
Caminiti.
</P>
<P>
   An error by Astros second baseman Craig Biggio helped the Cubs
get on the scoreboard in the bottom of third. Center fielder Lance
Johnson singled, stole second and scored on a sharp grounder by
Mickey Morandini that Biggio was unable to handle.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a tough field,'' said Biggio, whose error was one of
11 the Astros have made this season. ``Errors are a part of a game;
it just depends on how you get them. If you get them by being
aggressive, that's easier to accept.''
</P>
<P>
   Once again, the Astros benefited from putting the leadoff runner
on base in the fourth inning. Hidalgo reached on an infield single
and eventually scored on a sacrifice fly by Gutierrez. Everett's
two-run triple in the fifth pushed the Astros' lead to 5-1.
</P>
<P>
   The Cubs closed the gap against Lima in the bottom of the fifth,
scoring three runs on four hits, including Sammy Sosa's third homer
_ a long solo blast across Waveland Avenue. Catcher Benito Santiago
had an RBI single in the inning, and another run scored on Gary
Gaetti's bad-hop double to left field.
</P>
<P>
   ``I tried to go with a fastball away,'' Lima said of his gopher
ball to Sosa. ``I made the mistake of leaving the pitch in the
middle of the plate, and you know what Sammy is going to do if you
do that. You have to give him his credit.''
</P>
<P>
   Williams and Elarton held the Cubs to just one hit and two
baserunners over the final four innings. Elarton struck out four
batters.

LAKERS WIN MINUS O'NEAL

<P>
   OAKLAND _ All Lakers coach Kurt Rambis wants is for his
floundering team to get better. Does performing miracles signal
significant improvement?
</P>
<P>
   All the Lakers did Tuesday night against the Golden State
Warriors was fall behind by 28 points in the first half, watch
their top scorer get ejected, take a 20-point deficit into the
fourth quarter and somehow pull out a wild, crazy, incredible,
almost ridiculous comeback that sent the game into overtime.
</P>
<P>
   Five minutes later they had pulled out a 106-102 victory in
front of 20,108, the largest crowd in the history of the Oakland
Coliseum Arena. At least half of them were screaming in ecstasy for
the visitors and their miracle-working 20-year-old, Kobe Bryant.
</P>
<P>
   Bryant's 16-point fourth quarter brought the Lakers back from
the edge, and his hand-of-God-guided tip-in at the final buzzer of
regulation sent the game into overtime. And sent the Oakland fans
into a ``Ko-be'' chant frenzy.
</P>
<P>
   Bryant finished with 27 points.
</P>
<P>
   The Lakers had trailed since early in the first quarter and
didn't take the lead again until Tyronn Lue's bucket to open
overtime. A Robert Horry 3-pointer and a Bryant put-back jam gave
the Lakers their biggest lead of the game at 99-91.
</P>
<P>
   But the Warriors weren't finished, fouling and cutting the lead
to 102-99 with less than a minute to go. But rookie Antawn Jamison
gave the Lakers a gift, chasing a defensive rebound out of bounds
and tossing it back in to Horry for an easy dunk that made it
104-99 with 46.5 seconds left.
</P>
<P>
   Jamison atoned with a 3-pointer to cut it to 104-102, but Travis
Knight blocked a John Starks baseline lean-in and the Warriors had
to foul. Horry made two free throws to seal the improbable victory.
</P>
<P>
   The incremental improvement the Lakers had showed in Monday's
victory over Vancouver faded away in a horrible first half that saw
the Warriors take a 28-point lead and O'Neal get tossed.
</P>
<P>
   The Lakers combined their worst first quarter of the season (10
points), their worst half of the season (33 points) and the most
ill-timed ejection of the season (O'Neal, second quarter).
</P>
<P>
   Without their leading scorer and rebounder, the Lakers mounted a
furious fourth-quarter comeback, closing to within 88-87 with 4.2
seconds to go _ the closest they had been since the start of the
game. Bryant's 26-foot 3-pointer reduced the lead to one point.
</P>
<P>
   O'Neal could have been the one to reverse the Lakers' fate, but
he almost guaranteed a loss by getting ejected with an uncalled-for
shove to the back of Bimbo Coles.
</P>
<P>
   The Lakers were down 24 points at the time, with 3:29 to go in
the first half. Coles and Robert Horry had just exchanged words,
and Coles pushed Horry away _ then got nailed in the back by
O'Neal.
</P>
<P>
   That gave O'Neal his second technical foul of the night, and an
automatic ejection _ but not before trying to go after Coles again.
Teammates and officials restrained him from committing any further
pointless acts, the kind that would draw a suspension.
</P>
<P>
   The Lakers scored the first two points of the game on O'Neal
free throws, then went six minutes without scoring as the Warriors
took a 16-2 lead. The Lakers didn't make their first field goal
until the 5:24 mark of the first quarter and ended the period down
32-10.
</P>
<P>
   All this with the Trail Blazers awaiting them tonight in
Portland for the third game in three nights.
</P>
<P>
   And these are the alleged heirs to Michael Jordan's Bulls? MJ,
sitting courtside (flanked by Oakland Mayor Jerry Brown and
sportscaster Joe Morgan), must have chuckled or choked at the
thought.
</P>
<P>
   After everything the Lakers have been through this season _ the
coaching change, the blockbuster trade, the Dennis Rodman fiasco
and all the losses in between _ coach Kurt Rambis said wins and
losses can no longer be the measure of his team's progress.
</P>
<P>
   The playoffs are all that matter, and with virtually no practice
time to prepare for them, that leaves only games to work on the
finer details.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's why I'm not worried about who we're playing or whether
we win or lose the ballgames. It's more important for us to
improve,'' Rambis said. ``That's what's going to give us the best
chance in the playoffs, if we improve in these ballgames. So that's
what I'm trying to encourage and that's what I'm trying to develop
in these guys and get them to understand that.''
</P>
<P>
   Not that the win-loss count, or playoff seeding are unimportant,
but Rambis figures such things will ``take care of themselves, if
we play hard and improve and do all the things we're capable of
doing. . . .
</P>
<P>
   ``To me it's the only logical way of doing it. Since we don't
have the practice time to develop it and show them (their) mistakes
. . . you gotta do it in the game. And they've gotta learn while
they're actually trying to win basketball games.''

RED SOX BEAT TIGERS

 BBA-RED SOX-TIGERS-BOS   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)

 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   DETROIT _ It was only the fourth inning Tuesday night when Troy
O'Leary's line drive disappeared into the upper deck of Tiger
Stadium, so Mike Stanley thought he was only kidding about Pedro
Martinez when he muttered to Red Sox coach Jim Rice, ``There's your
run, Petey, go get 'em.''
</P>
<P>
   But after the Red Sox ace, with the able assistance of relievers
Rheal Cormier and Derek Lowe, shut out the Detroit Tigers on three
hits, 1-0, Stanley recalled how he once relied on another pitcher
to make even the thinnest of margins hold up.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's what we used to say to Nolan any time we got him an
early run,'' said Stanley, who played with Hall of Famer Nolan Ryan
in Texas.
</P>
<P>
   ``Petey will pretty much keep us in any ballgame every time he
toes the rubber if we score some runs.''
</P>
<P>
   The number of runs put up on the board Tuesday night by the Sox,
who had just three hits and have scored two or fewer runs in five
of their last six games, matched the number of vulgar balloons
tossed onto the field by the meager crowd of 12,558.
</P>
<P>
   The sight of that flesh-colored, ahem, object, sailing onto the
center-field grass gave Martinez his one moment of comic relief
(``I was laughing'') on a night when the Red Sox ace had trouble
concealing his fury when manager Jimy Williams came to fetch him
after Gregg Jefferies's two-out single in the eighth.
</P>
<P>
   Martinez (3-1), who rang up 10 strikeouts for the second
straight game and had set down 13 in a row until Jefferies stuck
out his bat and dropped a ball in front of center fielder Darren
Lewis, thought Williams was approaching with words of
encouragement.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, Williams, mindful that Martinez already had expended
130 pitches, came bearing a hook, summoning lefthander Cormier to
face lefthanded-hitting Bobby Higginson.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought he was coming out to talk to me since we don't have
Flash,'' said Martinez, alluding to the absence of injured closer
Tom Gordon. ``So did Val (John Valentin). Val said, `Naw, aren't
you going to give him a chance to get one more batter?' I gave Jimy
a little fight.''
</P>
<P>
   The Sox manager didn't take it personally, and Martinez's wrath
subsided quickly.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's such a competitor, I'll take 25 like him,'' Williams
said. ``A manager has decisions he has to make, that he has to live
with.''
</P>
<P>
   Cormier made the livin' easy. After Jefferies stole second on
his first pitch, Cormier ended the eighth by retiring Higginson on
a tapper to Stanley at first, then started the ninth by striking
out the unfortunate Tony Clark, who already had gone down swinging
three times against Martinez.
</P>
<P>
   Out popped Williams again, this time to summon Lowe, the
suburban homeboy (Dearborn) who as a kid used to shag balls in the
left-field seats here and was a big fan of Black Jack Morris. Lowe,
who not only had 50 family members and relatives watching but was
mindful that this was his first audition as Gordon's stand-in, fell
behind 3-and-0 on the first batter he faced, Dean Palmer.
</P>
<P>
   But Lowe came back to strike out the third baseman, then fanned
Damion Easley for the save, which made it a lot easier for him to
look toward Martinez's locker after the game.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sure, because I was on the other end, I used to be a starter
so I know how hard it is to get wins,'' Lowe said. ``When a starter
is pitching that good, you want to get the win for him.''
</P>
<P>
   Only one Tiger advanced to third against Martinez in the first
seven innings. That was in the second, when rising young star Juan
Encarnacion followed his single by stealing second and taking third
on an error by shortstop Nomar Garciaparra, who bounced his throw
to Stanley.
</P>
<P>
   Bill Haselman, who reached on the error, stole second
uncontested as the Sox didn't bite at Tiger manager Larry Parrish's
designs on a double steal. Deivi Cruz, the overmatched No. 9
hitter, tapped out to third to end the threat.
</P>
<P>
   Except for the ball O'Leary hit upstairs for his fourth home run
on a 2-and-0 fastball, the Sox did little against Tigers prized
rookie Jeff Weaver (out of Williams's alma mater, Fresno State),
who dazzled Boston with his 95 mile-an-hour fastball until leaving
after the sixth.
</P>
<P>
   How does Weaver compare with Williams in the Fresno State
pecking order? Williams answered with a little Jimywocky.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm way, way down that totem pole,'' he said, ``and I'm not
even an Indian.''
</P>
<P>
   Speaking of the Indians, this was the Sox' first 1-0 win since
Martinez outdueled Cleveland's Bartolo Colon last July 15 _ a game
decided on a home run by the since-discarded Midre Cummings _ and
first on the road since May 30, 1995, a game started by Tim
Wakefield.
</P>
<P>
   ``Doesn't matter if it's 1-0 or 8-0,'' Stanley said. ``A win's a
win.''

2 IN COLO. SCHOOL SAID TO GUN DOWN AS MANY AS 23, THEN KILL
THEMSELVES
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Subs 2nd-4th grafs for updating, rewriting)  (sw) 
 By JAMES BROOKE   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   LITTLETON, Colo. _ In the deadliest school massacre in the
nation's history, two young men stormed into a suburban high school
here at lunch time on Tuesday with guns and explosives, killing as
many as 23 students and teachers and wounding at least 20 in a
five-hour siege, the authorities said.
</P>
<P>
   The two students who are believed to have been the gunmen were
identified as Eric Harris and Dylan Klebold, students at Columbine
High School, said Steve Davis, the spokesman for the Jefferson
County Sherriff's Department. They were found dead of
self-inflicted gunshot wounds in the library, Davis said.
</P>
<P>
   Beginning about 11:30 a.m., the gunmen, wearing ski masks,
stalked through the school as they fired semiautomatic weapons at
students and teachers and tossed explosives, with one student being
hit nine times in the chest by shrapnel, the authorities said.
Gunshots continued to ring out at the school for hours. At least 13
bombs were found inside the school. One of them, set on a timer,
exploded just before 11 p.m. on Tuesday night, officials said.
There were no injuries.
</P>
<P>
   Three automobiles were rigged with bombs, one of which exploded.
</P>
<P>
   About 3 p.m., hundreds of police officers evacuated the building
and searched for the gunmen. Their bodies and those of several of
their victims appeared to have been wired with explosives.
</P>
<P>
   Sheriff John Stone said, ``It appears to be a suicide mission.''
</P>
<P>
   Davis said that as many as 25 people were dead, ``a mixture of
students and faculty.'' He said that most of the bodies were found
in the school's entrance, the library and the commons cafeteria. No
precise death toll was available.
</P>
<P>
   Kaleb Newberry, 16, said: ``I was in class and one teacher came
in and basically told us to run for our lives, I saw a girl maybe
five paces behind me fall. She was shot in the leg, but a teacher
helped her.''
</P>
<P>
   Students said the gunmen were part of a group of misfits who
called themselves the trench coat mafia, which expressed disdain
for racial minorities and athletes. Members of the group found
their way out of anonymity at the school by banning together,
dressing in dark gothic-style clothing including long black coats.
They became easy to notice among the 1,870 students at the school,
since every day, regardless of the weather, they wore their coats.
</P>
<P>
   On Tuesday, the gunmen appeared to aim at minority members and
athletes at the 1,800-student school, as well as peers who had
poked fun at the group in the past.
</P>
<P>
   School officials had had no reports of trouble from the
suspects, Davis said.
</P>
<P>
   Some victims were forced to wait inside the school for rescue.
By early evening, bodies had not been removed because of the crime
scene investigation and the possible presence of explosives, a
spokesman for the Jefferson County Sheriff's Department said.
</P>
<P>
   Davis said at a news conference on Tuesday night that two other
students at the school, thought to be friends of the gunmen, were
in custody for questioning in connection with the shooting.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can't really go in and do this kind of damage without a
lot of preparation.'' Davis said, ``without a lot of ammunition and
apparently some type of bombs.''
</P>
<P>
   Fourteen-year-old Katie Corona, said she was trapped in a
classroom with her teacher and about 30 classmates for hours.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought I was going to die,'' she said. ``I really didn't
think I was going to make it. We would hear shots, then we heard
crying. We had no clue what was going on.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Everyone around me got shot and I begged him for 10 minutes
not to shoot me,'' one young woman, who was not identified, said on
Tuesday night in an interview broadcast on the Cable News Network.
``And he just put the gun in my face and started laughing and
saying it was all because people were mean to him last year.''
</P>
<P>
   Another student, who said she heard more gunshots while hiding
in the closet with a teacher and some friends, said she kept
thinking to herself, ``This can't be happening to our school.''
</P>
<P>
   ``You should be safe at school,'' added a second young woman,
who also was not identified. ``This should be a safe place.''
</P>
<P>
   The families of those killed were being notified on Tuesday
night at Leawood Elementary School, where students and parents had
gathered.
</P>
<P>
   The mass shooting was the first at an American school during
this academic year, but revived memories of similar tragedies that
struck six different communities last year and set off national
alarms about teen-age violence. Four girls and a teacher were shot
to death and 10 people were wounded during a false fire alarm at a
middle school in Jonesboro, Ark., last March.
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton immediately dispatched a crisis-response team
to aid the school community and the victim's families.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't know yet all the how's or why's of this tragedy;
perhaps we will never fully understand it,'' the president said in
a nationally televised news conference just before 8 p.m. ``St.
Paul reminds us that we all see things in life darkly, that we only
partly understand what is happening.''
</P>
<P>
   He added, ``We do know that we must do more to reach out to our
children and teach them to express their anger and to resolve their
conflicts with words, not weapons.''
</P>
<P>
   A sunny spring day turned into a bloody nightmare for this
suburb of 35,000 people southwest of Denver, as ambulances ferried
the injured from the high school, past tennis courts, a baseball
diamond and a packed student parking lot.
</P>
<P>
   ``I hope we can all pull together, because we will need all our
strengths,'' Jane Hammond, Jefferson County superintendent of
schools, said on Tuesday night. The blood banks in the Denver area
have been overwhelmend with calls from donors. On Tuesday night,
there were at least three church vigils for the dead and injured.
</P>

</P>
<P>
   Just before 8 p.m., Lisa Appleton, 16, a sophomore, waited in
front of the Leawood school for news of her best friend, Julie
Toms, who had been missing since students began leaving the school.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can't even feel it,'' she said. ``There's no way to know
whether she's dead or alive.''
</P>
<P>
   About 3 p.m., SWAT teams of police officers used a fire truck
and an armored car to get close to the building, dozens of students
raced out of the two-story building, some slipping in the mud,
others holding up their hands in the air or behind their heads.
Police said they feared that the gunmen would try to escape by
mingling with the trapped students.
</P>
<P>
   One student, bloodied from an injury, broke out a second-story
window, and climbed down into the hands of the police.
</P>
<P>
   As police officers established a wide perimeter around the beige
school, students and school workers gathered on nearby tree-lined
streets and told of the chaos and horror inside the building.
</P>
<P>
   As fire alarms rang in the halls, students who had seen the
gunmen trampled each other to get out of the building, running
through one exit where three bodies lay on a staircase.
</P>
<P>
   Trapped inside, others took refuge in classrooms, bathrooms and
a choir room, frantically barricading doors with desks and file
cabinets.
</P>
<P>
   One cafeteria worker who barricaded herself in a woman's
bathroom said, ``We could hear them blowing the heck out of the
place.''
</P>
<P>
   A student, Jonathan Ladd, said, ``I heard gunshots going off,
bullets ricocheting off lockers.''
</P>
<P>
   The trench coat mafia is a small band of about a dozen juniors
and seniors at Columbine who are easily recognized yet little
feared, according to people who live in the neighborhood near the
school. Regardless of the weather, they favor long black coats and
the Gothic look popularized by the rock singer Marilyn Manson,
neighbors said. Some even wear white pancake makeup and dark
eyeliner, one student said.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was that devilish, half-dead, half-alive look,'' said Bret,
a 16-year-old sophomore who spoke on the condition only his first
name be used.
</P>
<P>
   The group often gathered in the cafeteria after school. Chris
McCaffrey, manager of Angie's Restaurant a few blocks from
Columbine, said that residents had known about the group for about
five years, and that no one considered it a threat.
</P>
<P>
   ``Mostly it was just kids who nobody wanted to have anything to
do with,'' McCaffrey said. ``They weren't particularly feared. They
were just a bunch of punks who kind of hang around the school.''
</P>
<P>
   Students said the group was mostly boys, but that some girls
appeared to be closely associated with it. One student described
the group as ``nerds, geeks and dweebs trying to find someplace to
fit in.''
</P>
<P>
   Bret suggested the mafia might have targeted athletes out of
resentment for their own lack of popularity and success at school.
</P>
<P>
   The students ``weren't really accepted as younger kids and as
they got older they were accepted by this group,'' Bret said.
``They got their fair share of being picked on. I could understand
that they might have targeted some of the more popular kids.''
</P>
<P>
   David Mesch, another student, who was searching for his mother
who works for the school, said, ``They were wearing masks; they
were members of the trench coat mafia.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton said tonight that he was ``profoundly shocked and
saddened by the tragedy on Tuesday in Littleton.''
</P>
<P>
   In an age when cellular telephones are increasingly common among
high school students, several trapped students called television
stations when they could not get through on 911 lines.
</P>
<P>
   ``I hear a couple of gunshots, people running up and down,'' a
student said in a frightened whisper to KUSA-TV, a Denver
television station. Identifying himself only as James, he added,
``There are a bunch of kids downstairs, I can hear them crying.''
</P>
<P>
   Aware that the gunmen might be watching on a classroom
television set, he said, ``I am staying upstairs,'' and then hung
up.
</P>
<P>
   In a state with a relatively low crime rate, the siege after the
shootings was broadcast live by Denver television stations, without
commercial breaks all afternoon. Broadcast and cable networks
turned to local affiliates for help with their coverage.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a cultural virus,'' Gov. Bill Owens of Colorado said
before hurrying to the scene. Noting that he felt particularly
affected by the tragedy because his 16-year-old daughter goes to a
suburban Denver high school, he said, ``We have to ask ourselves
what kind of children we are raising.''
</P>
<P>
   At the White House, the president said the nation should focus
on praying for the victims' families and others at the school. He
said that Attorney General Janet Reno was closely monitoring the
situation, and that he had spoken on Tuesday afternoon with Owens
and Patricia Holloway, the county commissioner, whose comments he
shared with the nation.
</P>
<P>
   In midafternoon, police officers briefly detained three young
white men who wore camouflaged pants and black jackets, next to the
high school. After they were released, the men said they knew the
gunmen inside the high school. Emblazoned on the back of one man's
jacket were the words, ``Ban Religion'' and a red-painted stop sign
printed over a cross.

   CHICAGO _ In three of Jim Parque's innings Tuesday night, the
Chicago White Sox left-hander set the Mariners down in order. In
each of the other three, he left two men on base.
</P>
<P>
   The Mariners couldn't come through when it counted, and it
doomed them to a 3-1 loss to the White Sox in the opener of a
three-game series at Comiskey Park. Only 8,980 fans bought tickets
for a game delayed 1 hour and 10 minutes by rain, and considerably
fewer showed up.
</P>
<P>
   ``Early in the ballgame we had a few chances, and we just didn't
come through,'' said Mariners manager Lou Piniella. ``But it was a
tough night to hit, too. This was the first time we've played in
cold weather. Up until now, we've played in the Dome and in
California.''
</P>
<P>
   But if the 47-degree weather chilled the Mariners' offense, it
didn't seem to bother Jeff Fassero. The loss ran Fassero's record
to 0-3 for the first time in his career, but Tuesdayu's defeat
can't be blamed on the left-hander. He went seven innings, allowing
three runs on eight hits and a walk.
</P>
<P>
   It was the second solid outing in a row for Fassero, who gave up
three runs in eight innings last Thursday in a no-decision against
the Texas Rangers.
</P>
<P>
   ``I felt a little stiff when I threw my first warm-up pitches,
but then I got a little sweat going and it wasn't too bad,''
Fassero said. ``I felt good. I thought I threw the ball well,
location was good, we got some double plays when I needed them. The
last two games, I've thrown well enough to win them both.''
</P>
<P>
   He might have won this time were it not for Ray Durham, who is
never a pleasant sight for Fassero. Durham greeted Fassero's '99
season with a triple on opening day, and with three hits Tuesday
the White Sox second baseman is batting .452 off him lifetime.
</P>
<P>
   Durham singled to lead off the game, but Fassero induced a
double play with the bases loaded to get out of the inning.
</P>
<P>
   In the fifth, he reached on an infield single, stole second and
scored on a Frank Thomas double. In the seventh, with Fassero one
pitch from escaping the inning, Durham slammed a solo homer to put
the Sox up, 3-1.
</P>
<P>
   ``Durham's just a good hitter,'' Fassero said. ``You throw him
inside, he gets a hit; you throw him away, he gets a hit. He's just
a patient hitter. He doesn't swing at a lot of bad pitches.''
</P>
<P>
   Chicago's other run came in the second, when Darrin Jackson led
off with a double that eluded left fielder Butch Huskey and scored
on a single by Brook Fordyce.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought I had it judged and I had it on a line,'' Huskey
said. ``But I misjudged it. It had a lot more carry than I
thought.''
</P>
<P>
   The M's, meanwhile, scored only on Russ Davis' second-inning
double. They had runners on second and third with one out after
Davis' hit, but Dan Wilson lined out and Domingo Cedeno flied out.
</P>
<P>
   In the third, after singles by David Segui and Ken Griffey Jr.
and a walk by Edgar Martinez, Jay Buhner grounded into an
inning-ending double play.
</P>
<P>
   In the sixth, Huskey and Davis batted with one out and runners
at first and second, but neither could advance the runners. Though
the M's entered the game batting .317 with runners in scoring
position, they were 1-for-7 in that situation Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   After Parque departed, relievers Keith Foulke, Bryan Ward, Bill
Simas and Bob Howry finished off Seattle.
</P>
<P>
   The loss left Piniella toying with lineup changes. He said he
may put shortstop Domingo Cedeno in the leadoff spot, where second
baseman David Bell has hit since Carlos Guillen's season-ending
knee injury on April 10.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've been playing with the idea that he could work the
pitchers,'' Piniella said of Cedeno. ``David's an aggressive
hitter. He doesn't take many pitches. We don't have what you would
call a classic leadoff hitter at all. We make do.''

DODGERS TWEAK BULLPEN
</HEADLINE>
 (ADDS INFO ON OSUNA MRI) (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By BRIAN DOHN  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ With the dawning of a new day, it can only mean
there is news regarding the Dodgers' bullpen. It's been like that
since spring training began, and the trend has slowed little.
</P>
<P>
   Tuesday, the Dodgers purchased the contract of right-hander
Jamie Arnold from Triple-A Albuquerque and designated catcher Rick
Wilkins for assignment.
</P>
<P>
   Arnold, a former No. 1 pick of the Atlanta Braves, was in
uniform for the Dodgers' game against Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
   After the Dodgers 5-4 win, manager Davey Johnson revealed
right-hander Antonio Osuna will have an MRI today on the right
elbow that was surgically repaired last September. That elbow also
caused Osuna to begin this season on the disabled list.
</P>
<P>
   ``Before the game during batting practice, when I went to play
catch, I felt soreness,'' Osuna said. ``It's the same spot as
spring training. I don't think it's bad. I think it's just a day or
two.''
</P>
<P>
   Even so, the Dodgers are taking no chances with an already
depleted bullpen. Johnson said earlier in the day that main set-up
man Alan Mills, who's pitched in seven games already, has some
tenderness in his right arm.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's messed up right now,'' Johnson said of the bullpen. ``I
was rolling dice out there.''
</P>
<P>
   Since the Dodgers left Arizona on Thursday, their bullpen has
been revamped. They dealt long-man Dave Mlicki and Mel Rojas to
Detroit for right-hander Robinson Checo and a pair of
minor-leaguers. Checo's first outing with the Dodgers produced five
earned runs in 31/3 innings.
</P>
<P>
   So Johnson said it was necessary to promote Arnold, 25, who has
pitched in 15 games above the Double-A level. Arnold was 1-0 with a
1.29 ERA with Albuquerque.
</P>
<P>
   Wilkins, 33, was the Dodgers' third catcher behind Todd Hundley
and Paul LoDuca. He signed a split contract between the major and
minor leagues and said he would accept an assignment to Albuquerque
if he clears waivers.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was talking to Davey and he said somebody would probably
claim me, so we'll have to see what happens. He doesn't think I'll
clear waivers,'' said Wilkins, 0 for 4 this season. ``I feel like I
have a lot left to where I can contribute.''
</P>
<P>
   __ Skipping a start?: Johnson said a decision hasn't been made
on which Dodgers pitcher would be skipped in the rotation, a
necessity since they are off Thursday and Monday.
</P>
<P>
   However, struggling lefty Carlos Perez is the most likely
candidate. Perez (0-3) is coming off Monday's outing in which he
allowed six runs in 32/3 innings.
</P>
<P>
   ``It probably wouldn't hurt Carlos to have a couple good side
workouts,'' Johnson said. ``With the exception of (Monday), he's
pitched OK. But when he goes, he goes quick.''
</P>
<P>
   __ A day of rest: A day after dropping shortstop Mark
Grudzielanek to eighth in the batting order, Johnson decided to
give him the day off. Grudzielanek has been fine defensively, but
he's hitting .216 with two RBI. He's also struck out six times and
is yet to walk.
</P>
<P>
   ``Grudzielanek is fighting himself, worrying about too much,''
Johnson said. ``He's too good of an athlete to worry. He looks like
he's about ready to explode, fighting it. The best thing is to pull
him away from it. The guy's got a lot of talent. I want him to
relax and use it.''
</P>
<P>
   __ Balks, walks and chalk: Dodgers outfielder Todd Hollandsworth
was 3 for 5 with 3 RBI in a rehab start with Class-A San
Bernardino. He started in left field and played eight innings. . .
. Dodgers third baseman Adrian Beltre extended his hitting streak
to nine games with a second-inning single. . . . Saturday's game
against the St. Louis Cardinals _ i.e., Mark McGwire _ is sold out.
. . . The Dodgers went over the 100 million mark in attendance
since Dodger Stadium opened.

   1. AFTERLIFE : BILL WYMAN ON MUSIC, THE STONES
</P>
<P>
   AND THE REST OF THE WORLD Bill Wyman quit the Rolling Stones
seven years ago after 31 years, but he's still a Stone at heart.
He's still the unofficial historian for a group that has plenty of
history. ``I think they appreciate that someone keeps a record for
posterity,'' Wyman says. His collection of Stones memorabilia was a
great source for his 1990 memoir, ``Stone Alone,'' and it also
decorates the walls of Wyman's three British restaurants. By Scott
Cooper. 1,500 words + photo. 2. STAR WARS COUNTDOWN PACKAGE
</P>
<P>
   Ian Spelling, who writes the ``Inside Trek'' column for The New
York Times Syndicate, is doing a special series of stories on the
new and much-anticipated ``Star Wars'' prequel film, ``The Phantom
Menace,'' which premieres in the U.S. on May 19. (Fans there have
been going to cinemas just to see the trailer for the film.)
</P>
<P>
   A. Interview with Samuel L. Jackson (who plays Mace Windu); B.
Interview with Ewan McGregor (who plays Obi-Wan Kenobi; C.
Interview with Liam Neeson (who plays Kenobi's mentor, Qui-Gon.) D.
Feature about the crazy antics of ``Star Wars'' fans E. ``Star
Wars'' Trivia Quiz Art is available. Please contact us for more
details. 3. NEW BLUE : RICK SCHRODERIS 'NYPD BLUE'S' LATEST ROOKIE
Eyebrows were raised across America when producer Steven Bochco
announced that Rick Schroder would replace Jimmy Smits on the
long-running ABC hit, ``NYTPD Blue.'' Right from his first entrance
as Detective Danny Sorensen, Schroder vividly brought to life a cop
who was young, but old enough to have demons of his own. The show's
ratings have actually risen since his arrival, which Schroder
writes off to people's curiosity about impending disaster. By David
Kronke. From TV Guide Canada. 1,200 words + photo. 4. KEEPING UP
WITH THE JONES' : CATHERINE ZETA-JONES IS MAKING STARDOM WORK THE
SECOND TIME AROUND Five years after she completed a fairly
traditional 15 minutes of fame and saw herself consigned to
washed-up status, Catherine Zeta-Jones doesn't look like a
has-been. Last summer's ``The Mask of Zorro'' paid her way onto the
Hollywood hot list and two films in the next four months should
tell whether she has what it takes to stay there. In ``Entrapment''
she will appear opposite Sean Connery (as rival art thieves who
team up in business and romance,) and with Liam Neeson in the ghost
story ``The Haunting.'' By Cindy Pearlman. 1,300 words + photo.
_____________________________________________________________ 5. AN
ACTOR'S ACTOR TAKES A BOW This year, Dustin Hoffman, now 61, joined
film legends such as Elizabeth Taylor, Orson Welles, John Wayne and
John Huston as a recipient of the American Film Institute's
prestigious Life Achievement Award. The award is well-deserved. It
is difficult to think of another actor who so well articulates the
complicated, angst-ridden, ego-driven urban man of the late 20th
century. By Ivor Davis. 1,000 words + photos. (N/A Great Britain
and Australia.)
_____________________________________________________________ 6.
HOLLYWOOD GETS SERIOUS ABOUT VIDEO PIRATES Bill Shannon, a
highly-decorated 30-year veteran of the New York Police Department,
is no longer a police detective but he's still conducting
investigations. Now, as chief of the Motion Picture Association of
America's New York anti-piracy office, Shannon and his team of 22
investigators attempt to make the burgeoning illegal video business
so costly that pirates will look elsewhere. By Brooks Boliek. From
The Hollywood Reporter. 2,000 words + photo. 7. HIS PEN IS MIGHTY
In the past decade, no one has left a more indelible signature on
prime time television than David E. Kelly, a lawyer who turned
prodigiously prolific writer-producer. Nor does Kelley show any
signs of reducing a workload that still makes jaws drop in the TV
industry. With Kelley-created dramas already airing - ``The
Practice,'' ``Ally McBeal'' and ``Chicago Hope,'' he is at work on
yet another show, this time about high-tech detectives. By Don
Aucoin. From The Boston Globe. 1,400 words + photo. Please fax to

 &HT;    FROM UPSCALE TO DOWN-HOME, SOUTHERN COOKING ABOUNDS IN CAPITAL
 &HT;    With SOUTHERN-FOOD-LIST. Moving in (t) travel and (d) food
categories for release Sunday, May 9.
 &HT;    By BOB DART
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ George Strait's picture is on the wall and his
voice is on the jukebox. A plaster of Paris catfish hangs from the
skylight and gospel singers make a joyful noise during Sunday
brunch. But it's the skillet cornbread that draws transplanted
Southerners to the Music City Roadhouse in trendy Georgetown.
</P>
<P>
   The Roadhouse is among an assortment of restaurants in and
around the nation's capital that cater to expatriates of Dixie.
These folks crave the victuals they were reared on and savor the
memories resurrected by heaping helpings of collards, fried green
tomatoes and sweet potato pie.
</P>
<P>
   People are what they eat _ culturally as well as nutritionally.
</P>
<P>
   ``Food is absolutely the backbone of culture,'' explained
William Ferris, chairman of the National Endowment for the
Humanities and former director of the Center for the Study of
Southern Culture at the University of Mississippi.
</P>
<P>
   ``Every region, every ethnic group resonates to food,'' he said.
``Foods really are symbolic _ making you remember not only the
eating but also the family conversations and bonding at the dinner
table.''
</P>
<P>
   For Ferris, a political appointee who recalls his rural
upbringing when he sips buttermilk, the nostalgia of down-home
cooking is hardly a dispassionate intellectual pursuit.
</P>
<P>
   ``I miss my grits and bacon and fried chicken and fried okra,
sweet potatoes, collard greens and cornbread. That's who I am.
That's what I grew up with. And I like to be at a table with that
cuisine,'' said Ferris. His favorite restaurant in the world is
Smitty's, on the town square in Oxford, Miss.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, one of his first tasks upon moving to Washington was to
plant a backyard garden of field peas, okra, squash, bell peppers,
cucumbers and tomatoes. But Ferris said the state of Southern
cooking ``is in pretty good condition'' in his new home.
</P>
<P>
   With a considerable portion of its populace made up of African
Americans with roots in the South, the District of Columbia has a
culinary heritage of ``soul food.'' Heavy on fried pork chops, fish
and chicken and well-cooked, pork-flavored vegetables, these
comforting meals have graced the tables of both black and white
Southerners for generations.
</P>
<P>
   The traditional dishes of Virginia, located just across the
Potomac River, have also historically been a savory part of the
District diet.
</P>
<P>
   Washington's cuisine ``used to be more Southern,'' said Phyllis
C. Richman, who grew up in the District and has been food critic of
the Washington Post for the past 22 years. ``Now Southern food is
like foreign food _ trendy food _ rather than indigenous food. But
there is still a Southern influence. Even the Washington Post
cafeteria offers grits for breakfast.''
</P>
<P>
   For more than half a century, the Florida Avenue Grill has been
the epicurean epicenter for authentic Southern cooking in the
capital city. The walls are covered with pictures of celebrities
who have eaten the cornbread, fried chicken, and red beans and rice
over the decades. There are testimonials from Strom Thurmond,
Denzel Washington, the Four Tops, Clarence Thomas, Janet Reno, Lena
Horne, Kris Kross, a dozen or so Washington Redskins and scores of
other distinguished diners.
</P>
<P>
   The homey restaurant is a must-stop for District politicians.
Former Mayor Marion Barry smiles down from the gallery of pictures.
New Mayor Anthony A. Williams ate a breakfast of fried eggs, grits,
sausage and biscuits at the Florida Avenue Grill on the morning
after his election.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are a lot of people who like this kind of food if you
season it right, but it's not for the dietitian,'' said owner Lacey
Wilson, who bought the business from his father in 1969. ``My
father was originally from North Carolina. He opened the restaurant
in 1944. The menu is from the South.''
</P>
<P>
   So is the menu at Georgia Brown's _ albeit vaguely. One of
several upscale, nouvelle Southern restaurants to open in the
District in the past decade, Georgia Brown's features the
low-country dishes from the coastal region between Savannah, Ga.,
and Charleston, S.C.
</P>
<P>
   ``We put a twist on some of the old classic dishes,'' said Neal
Langermann, the executive chef and a partner in the six-year-old
venture. Black-eyed peas are mashed into a cake, for instance, and
grits are loaded with shrimp, shallots, sausage and scallions.
</P>
<P>
   However, the innovation of crisp, undercooked collards met with
patron resistance. Tradition prevailed after Washington superlawyer
Vernon Jordan, a son of the South who knows his greens, advised the
chefs to cook the collards longer.
</P>
<P>
   Georgia Brown's food is prepared in an open kitchen as diners
sit beneath a ceiling sculpture of flowing metal strips that is
reminiscent of the spreading limbs of a live oak.
</P>
<P>
   Some purists chafe at the versions of down-home food served at
Georgia Brown's and the similarly upscale Vidalia.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's somebody's take on Southern cuisine, but it's not the
food I grew up on,'' said Jody Powell, a native of Vienna, Ga., who
came to town more than 20 years ago as President Carter's press
secretary and is now chairman of the Powell Tate public relations
firm.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can pretty much find that kind of food, but it takes a
little effort,'' he said. ``Fresh vegetables. Greens. Butter beans.
Field peas. It's hard to find butter beans at the right stage.
People up here are used to eating limas that are hard and big. Good
butter beans need to be cooked when they're small and tender. The
same thing is true with boiled peanuts. The peanuts need to be
pulled up when still young. I've given up trying to find them. When
I go home, I get some and bring them back.''
</P>
<P>
   Powell said he bought a place on the Eastern Shore of the
Chesapeake Bay to be in farm country ``when the vegetables start
coming in.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I do miss homemade jellies and preserves. That hot pepper
sauce you put on greens. Pear relish,'' he said. ``You'd think with
all this tasteless Yankee food, I would have lost some weight, but
I haven't.''
</P>
<P>
   Another uprooted Southerner who cooks his own roots food is Rep.
Billy Tauzin, R-La. His craving is for crawfish.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can get them fresh on the waterfront marina,'' he said.
``RT's, (with restaurants) both in Alexandria and Arlington (Va.),
has the most authentic Cajun cooking in the area.''
</P>
<P>
   But Tauzin, who is writing a book on Cajun recipes and history,
regularly has a cousin bring up staples from the bayou so he can
cook gumbo, jambalaya, milk-fed pig and other traditional Louisiana
dishes for political fund-raisers and other gatherings.
</P>
<P>
   ``I always keep some in the freezer for when I want something
good to eat,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   There are also a couple of Washington-area restaurant chains
that cater to Southern tastes. Red, Hot and Blue _ whose founders
include the late political strategist Lee Atwater, a South Carolina
native _ features barbecue, including dry-cooked Memphis-style
ribs. The Black-Eyed Pea provides Washington's version of ``meat
and three'' vegetables, plus cornbread and biscuits.
</P>
<P>
   Young staffers for members of Congress from Southern states
swell the clientele of the Music City Roadhouse, said manager Steve
Briggs. Located beside the C&AMP;O Canal in Georgetown, the roomy,
rollicking restaurant features a bar and pool tables downstairs and
several rooms of tables upstairs. Meals are served family style _
serving dishes set on the table so diners can help themselves.
</P>
<P>
   The menu is Southern standard: fried chicken, fried catfish,
country fried steak, barbecued spare ribs, pot roast, greens, sweet
potatoes, sliced cucumbers in vinegar. Cornbread is hot from the
skillet.
</P>
<P>
   The walls are covered with pictures of country music stars and
Elvis posters. There's live gospel music during brunch every
Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   Richman, the restaurant critic, said her home town could
probably use some more places that feature the tastes of the South.
With an Arkansan occupying the White House and the next
presidential election shaping as a contest between a Tennesseean
and a Texan, it doesn't seem there will be a shortage of hungry
Southerners any time soon.
</P>
<P>
   ``Besides, I like that kind of food,'' said Richman.

 &HT;    FROM UPSCALE TO DOWN-HOME, SOUTHERN COOKING ABOUNDS IN CAPITAL
 &HT;    With SOUTHERN-FOOD-LIST. Moving in (t) travel and (d) food
categories for release Sunday, May 9.
 &HT;    By BOB DART

<P>
   WASHINGTON _ George Strait's picture is on the wall and his
voice is on the jukebox. A plaster of Paris catfish hangs from the
skylight and gospel singers make a joyful noise during Sunday
brunch. But it's the skillet cornbread that draws transplanted
Southerners to the Music City Roadhouse in trendy Georgetown.
</P>
<P>
   The Roadhouse is among an assortment of restaurants in and
around the nation's capital that cater to expatriates of Dixie.
These folks crave the victuals they were reared on and savor the
memories resurrected by heaping helpings of collards, fried green
tomatoes and sweet potato pie.
</P>
<P>
   People are what they eat _ culturally as well as nutritionally.
</P>
<P>
   ``Food is absolutely the backbone of culture,'' explained
William Ferris, chairman of the National Endowment for the
Humanities and former director of the Center for the Study of
Southern Culture at the University of Mississippi.
</P>
<P>
   ``Every region, every ethnic group resonates to food,'' he said.
``Foods really are symbolic _ making you remember not only the
eating but also the family conversations and bonding at the dinner
table.''
</P>
<P>
   For Ferris, a political appointee who recalls his rural
upbringing when he sips buttermilk, the nostalgia of down-home
cooking is hardly a dispassionate intellectual pursuit.
</P>
<P>
   ``I miss my grits and bacon and fried chicken and fried okra,
sweet potatoes, collard greens and cornbread. That's who I am.
That's what I grew up with. And I like to be at a table with that
cuisine,'' said Ferris. His favorite restaurant in the world is
Smitty's, on the town square in Oxford, Miss.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, one of his first tasks upon moving to Washington was to
plant a backyard garden of field peas, okra, squash, bell peppers,
cucumbers and tomatoes. But Ferris said the state of Southern
cooking ``is in pretty good condition'' in his new home.
</P>

   DISPATCHES FROM DREAMSVILLE: A gift of adventure in volumes
</P>
<P>
   (''Dispatches from Dreamsville'' is an occasional series in
which readers share with Cox Newspapers senior writer Joe Murray
their memories of growing up in small-town America. Back then, or
at least the way we remember it, life was like a dream.)
</P>
<P>
   (A photo of Harley Johnson is available from Cox News Service by
calling 404-526-5456.)
</P>
<P>
   By Harley Johnson
</P>
<P>
   Special to Cox News Service
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Sam Jones was a widow lady so long as I knew her.
</P>
<P>
   She owned the farm that my father worked and the little
four-room house in which we lived at the time at Mooreville, a
community of farmers in central Texas.
</P>
<P>
   Her house, a beautiful English-style home with big trees in the
yard, was just up the gravel road from our little house and at the
top of the hill where the creek road intersected the main road
through town.
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Jones was the epitome of a lady of class and distinction,
very much respected and considered to be refined and well-educated.
</P>
<P>
   I sometimes thought of her as a queen or some sort of royalty,
the way she conducted herself, dressed and spoke.
</P>
<P>
   One particular day my mother sent me to Mrs. Jones's house on an
errand, and Mrs. Jones invited me in.
</P>
<P>
   I found myself in a beautiful room, very nicely furnished and
with a shelf full of books.
</P>
<P>
   I looked at the books and felt a magical attraction to them.
</P>
<P>
   We had no books in our house, except for the Bible. I had no
comprehension of the adventures within the pages of those books.
</P>
<P>
   My mother and father had not had the opportunity to achieve a
high degree of formal education.
</P>
<P>
   They were teens when the Great Depression ravaged the nation,
and they both had to help put food on the table for their families.
</P>
<P>
   They had no choice but to quit school. My father said he cried
at times because he could not go to school.
</P>
<P>
   When Mrs. Jones saw me looking at the books, she said, ``Do you
like to read?''
</P>
<P>
   I said, ``Yes'm, I think so.''
</P>
<P>
   And then she did something that to her was a simple act of
kindness, but to me was something that was so wonderful that I
could hardly believe it.
</P>
<P>
   She took a book from the shelf and said, ``Take this and read
it. My children loved the book, and I'll bet you do as well.''
</P>
<P>
   I took that book and cared for it as if it were worth a million
dollars. I read every word of ``The Swiss Family Robinson'' from
cover to cover, experiencing the adventures and all the beauty of
the island and the sea.
</P>
<P>
   It opened a new world for me. I have been reading ever since,
and I still take great care to preserve good books as valued
commodities.
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Jones probably had no idea of the impact of what she did.
Then, again, maybe she did.
</P>
<P>
   She may have seen a fertile spot to plant a little seed that
would grow and grow.
</P>
<P>
   I hope she knew how she enriched my life with her one simple act
of kindness.

 &HT;    Scooper maker gets the drop on posh pups
 &HT;    By Frank Cerabino
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. _ I had really big news for Frank
DeLoncker.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not kidding,'' I said, after dialing his business in
Elgin, Ill. ``Your product is the official pooper scooper of Palm
Beach.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Oh boy!'' said DeLoncker, the sales manager of Dualle
Products.
</P>
<P>
   (Now I know the vicarious thrill those sweepstakes notification
people must feel.)
</P>
<P>
   ``It elates me that we're the pick of the aristocrats,''
DeLoncker said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Yeah, you should be very proud,'' I said. ``They looked at 20
pooper scoopers before they picked your Doggie Bag-Grr.''
</P>
<P>
   To be able to fully appreciate the enormity of the moment,
DeLoncker wanted to know something about Palm Beach. So I told him
that when it came to excretal protocol, you couldn't find a pickier
podunk.
</P>
<P>
   ``They even put fragrances in the sewers there,'' I told him.
</P>
<P>
   ``Wow!'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Palm Beach's waste fixation _ did I mention daily garbage
service? _ has turned its upturned nose to dogs lately. An outfit
called the Palm Beach Civic Association's Citizens' Concerns
Committee has been on a jihad over dog droppings.
</P>
<P>
   If you listen to the group's chairwoman, Etonella Christlieb,
you'd think that people slide, rather than walk, through the
streets of Palm Beach.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's especially tough on the landscapers and UPS drivers who
walk across lawns,'' Christlieb said.
</P>
<P>
   The problem is, curbing after your dog poses a style problem in
Palm Beach. When the Citizens' Concerns Committee gave away a
thousand disposable bags last year, it didn't have much of an
effect.
</P>
<P>
   The basic middle-class method _ the less-than-elegant inside-out
maneuver with a Publix bag _ lacks the proper panache one is
expected to display on the gilded isle.
</P>
<P>
   So the island's dog do-gooders decided to make pooper scooping
the latest fashion rage. Here's what made the Doggie Bag-Grr so
appealing in Palm Beach: 1. The scooper is long enough so that no
bending is required. This is very important, seeing as how some
residents gave up bending after their first million, and the rest
either can't bend or don't want to bend for fear of spilling the
cocktail in their other hand.
</P>
<P>
   2. The disposable bags mean that the scooper doesn't require
washing or lawn wiping after each use. This is a cost savings,
because just about any sort of cleaning in Palm Beach requires the
hiring of additional help.
</P>
<P>
   3. The plastic handle is an ideal surface for decoration.
</P>
<P>
   Don't laugh. This was a real consideration.
</P>
<P>
   ``I paint them gold,'' Christlieb said. ``You can put
rhinestones on them. Gator fans can paint theirs orange and blue. .
. .''
</P>
<P>
   Last week, Christlieb gave scoopers to each of the town's
council members. And hundreds of Doggie Bag-Grrs will be going on
sale in six locations in town.
</P>
<P>
   ``I guess they really got behind this thing and pushed,''
DeLoncker said from Illinois.
</P>
<P>
   He doesn't know the half of it. The town's dog-poop lobby has
also leaned on the police department to start writing $66 tickets
to pooch owners who are caught leaving something behind.
</P>
<P>
   The first Palm Beacher was cited Monday. Christlieb called to
tell me about it. After hanging up, I thought, that's how Clinton's
going to sound when we finally get Yugoslav President Slobodan
Milosevic.
</P>
<P>
   I'd look for the island's smear campaign to get only worse.
Christlieb said what her group really wants is to change the law so
that police could cite dog owners if they are caught walking
without ``a device'' to pick up after their pet.
</P>
<P>
   The ticket would be written even if the act doesn't occur.
</P>
<P>
   Sounds like more Palm Beach fodder for the American Civil
Liberties Union: A violation of do-do process.
</P>

 &HT;    Stretch in 7th brought to you by Jane Fonda
 &HT;    By John Kelso
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ It beats me why folks get worked up about the
prospect of major-league baseball players wearing advertisements on
their uniforms.
</P>
<P>
   The rest of the people in this country are walking billboards
anyway. If you're an American, and you're not naked, there's a good
chance that right this minute you have on an article of clothing
that plugs a running shoe, cigarette, beer, software company, radio
station, tourist attraction or barbecue joint.
</P>
<P>
   So why should ballplayers be any different?
</P>
<P>
   Still, you hear people crab about the proposal to put 1- to 1
1/2-inch square patches that advertise, say, Burger King, Pizza Hut
or Popeyes on the sleeves of major-league players.
</P>
<P>
   Why are y'all worked up about this? Don't tell me about the
sanctity of the game. I think we're being a little two-faced here,
sports fans. Everybody's wearing ads on their ballcaps and T-shirts
out there. Trust me, folks. We're a nation of meandering marquees.
About the only available living advertising space left in this
country is my Disney dog, Harry. And for the right price, I'll let
you hang a sign on him.
</P>
<P>
   I don't think it would be a good idea to hang an Ex-Lax sign on,
say, Roger Clemens just because he works fast. But under most
circumstances, I can't understand why anyone would worry about ads
on uniforms.
</P>
<P>
   With that in mind, on Friday I went downtown _ dressed in my
purple jacket with ``Roy's Taxi'' on the back _ to ask folks what
they thought of advertising on baseball uniforms.
</P>
<P>
   Everybody I spoke to was wearing a piece of clothing that
shilled for something. I saw everything from a Jim Beam ballcap to
a shirt plugging Advantage Properties. And, to be truthful, most of
the people I talked to didn't seem to care if Sammy Sosa had
Budweiser tattooed on his butt in enormous red letters.
</P>
<P>
   But there are some folks who are at least a little bent out of
shape about the concept of major-leaguers pushing products on their
sleeves.
</P>
<P>
   ``I mean, I think it just cheapens the game,'' said Tim Yandell
of Abilene. He was standing on a Sixth Street sidewalk, dressed in
a stylish green ballcap advertising Bass. I'm not sure if Bass
referred to the shoe company, but I know it had nothing to do with
the fish.
</P>
<P>
   Hector Gonzales, a truck driver whom I ran across at Sixth and
Congress, said it's OK for baseball players to wear advertising on
their uniforms, so long as they're paid for it.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wouldn't advertise for anybody unless I was getting paid,''
said Gonzales, from underneath his gimme hat that plugged Quality
Auto Repair. I asked Gonzales if he was being paid by Quality Auto
Repair to wear the hat. He said he wasn't. I don't think he saw the
irony.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it's not a very good idea,'' said Jesse Felan, 19,
resplendent in a green T-shirt with white lettering advertising
Casino Parties Unlimited in Houston. ``They're already doing it on
everything else. It would be really stupid _ you know what I
mean?''
</P>
<P>
   Yeah, I know what you mean. But I'm just not going to lose a lot
of sleep over it. In fact, I'll sell some prime space on my
midsection _ maybe a painted sign from a barbecue joint _ and go
stand out on the corner of South Congress and Oltorf for $200 a
day.
</P>
<P>
   Where else are you gonna get a billboard that big for that
cheap?

 &HT;    Janeites of the world, Unite!
 &HT;    By Mary McCarty
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   DAYTON, Ohio _ Martha Caprarotta loves to think of the delicious
mincemeat Jane Austen would make of Martha Stewart: ``Jane Austen
would have a marvelous time satirizing Martha Stewart, with her
perfect little parties _ and being more interested in the veneer
than in whether everyone is having a good time.''
</P>
<P>
   As a loyal ``Janeite,'' (as Austen aficionados are called) and a
very modern woman, these are the kinds of questions _ common
threads between the two very different skeins of 19th-and
20th-century women _ that Caprarotta enjoys dissecting with her
friends in the Dayton chapter of the Jane Austen Society of North
America.
</P>
<P>
   Dayton's Janeites are inviting all of us to join the
conversation with a May 1 gala: ``Jane Austen: The Accomplished
Woman.''
</P>
<P>
   Life was completely different for women in the 19th century, of
course, with just this one little exception: They were expected to
be perfect.
</P>
<P>
   Consider the following from the ``The Mirror of Graces,'' the
1811 etiquette/conduct book written by ``a Lady of Distinction'':
</P>
<P>
   ``There is nothing, however minute in manners, however
insignificant in appearance, that does not demand some portion of
attention from a well-bred and highly polished young woman. The
choice of a gown, or even the folding and sealing of a letter, will
bespeak the shrew and the scold, the careless and the negligent.''
</P>
<P>
   No, the 19th-century woman wasn't expected to be the perfect
mother, breadwinner and public citizen while landscaping her own
water garden. She was merely expected to be the perfect
needlewoman, pianist, watercolorist _ and most of all, the perfect
catch for some eligible bachelor.
</P>
<P>
   ``In some ways, women today have it far worse,'' said
Caprarotta, better known locally as Martha Dunsky, a veteran
television reporter and producer who now works as a consultant for
NCR's Interactive Television Network. ``Martha Stewart tells them
they have to have a perfect house. Magazines and TV are saying you
have to look perfect. And, unlike the genteel woman of Austen's
time, you have no maids, and you raise your own children.'' (The
indignity of it all.)
</P>
<P>
   ``Economically, we're better off today,'' said fellow Jane-ite
Lisa Tyler, an associate professor of English at Sinclair Community
College. ``Back then, if you weren't married, you could starve.''
</P>
<P>
   Back then, if you weren't married, you were considered a failure
_ never mind if you happened to rank among the greatest novelists
of all time. Austen's gravestone extols a ``beloved daughter and
sister.'' The word ``writer'' is conspicuously absent.
</P>
<P>
   Austen sealed her destiny as a failure in her society by
refusing the marriage proposal of one Mr. Bigg-Withers (the name
says it all) in 1814. As she wrote her niece, Fanny Knight,
``Anything is to be preferred or endured rather than marrying
without affection.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It's such an irony that this great genius was by society's
standards a failure,'' Caprarotta said.
</P>
<P>
   The ``accomplished woman'' of the early 19th century is the
theme of this year's Jane Austen gala on May 1, sponsored by JASNA
and the University of Dayton. Festivities will include lectures,
art, music, dramatic readings, charades and a Regency Fashion show,
with costumes designed by Caprarotta. For information call
836-2408.
</P>
<P>
   Did Austen qualify as an ``accomplished woman'' by the standards
of her own time? She played the piano, and was certainly a lively
conversationalist, ``but the fact that she died a spinster, means
she was not accomplished enough,'' Tyler said.
</P>
<P>
   History avenged her brilliantly _ a cosmic strike for truly
accomplished women everywhere.

 &HT;    Show 'em you love 'em: No TV for a week!
 &HT;    By Emily J. Minor
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. _ Let's say you are normal, which of
course you are not _ otherwise you'd be checking your stock
dividends and yelling at your 2.5 kids.
</P>
<P>
   But let's pretend, and let's do it rather quickly because the
Today show is on right now and they're doing a segment on slimming
bathing suits and I want so see it. I need all the help I can get.
</P>
<P>
   So, you are. Normal, that is, which means that according to
Nielsen Media Research in New York City your family of three
watched 78 hours of television this past week.
</P>
<P>
   Seventy-eight hours.
</P>
<P>
   Rugrats. Doug. Ally McBeal. The Drew Carey Show. It's all
mandatory in your house. Every second of it.
</P>
<P>
   Your kid eats his chicken nuggets on a TV tray in front of the
tube. You eat your grilled cheese and tomato soup with one eye on
Dan Rather. Your husband watches Baseball Tonight when he's
supposed to be cuddling up to you and thinking about ...
</P>
<P>
   Well, you get the picture.
</P>
<P>
   If this is your life _ Wait. How could it be? It's mine! _ then
Henry Labalme has a deal for you.
</P>
<P>
   He wants you to give up television for seven days. And he'd
prefer that you do it without drugs. Otherwise, what would be the
point?
</P>
<P>
   In 1994, Labalme started an organization in Washington, D.C.,
called TV-Free America. He and a lawyer friend were just a couple
of years out of college.
</P>
<P>
   ``We would sit around and talk about how to save the world, and
we kept coming back to television as the root cause,'' Labalme
said.
</P>
<P>
   The two of them tried to get money through a grant. When that
didn't work, they wrote to about 400 family members and friends.
Together they raised $8,000 _ proof, I guess, that in our hearts we
all might really hate that stupid T.V. set.
</P>
<P>
   The first year they had National TV-Turnoff week was in 1995,
and Labalme figures about 1 million people joined in. This year, he
is expecting about 6 million. National TV-Turnoff Week starts
Thursday and runs through April 28.
</P>
<P>
   It won't be that bad. I mean, our family did it a couple of
years ago and we survived. Sort of. You can listen to baseball on
the radio. You can take a walk while you're taping The Guiding
Light. You can actually talk to your kid and your husband at
dinner.
</P>
<P>
   Drastic, I know. But our nation's television habits demand
toughness.
</P>
<P>
   According to Labalme, whose 7 1/2-month-old daughter Eve has yet
to watch a single Teletubbies episode, or anything else for that
matter, here is how sick we've become:
</P>
<P>
   --The average American watches TV for three hours and 43 minutes
every day.
</P>
<P>
   --Sixty-six percent of American households eat dinner while
watching television.
</P>
<P>
   --The average kid watches 1,680 minutes of television each week.
That's 28 hours a week, more than a part-time job.
</P>
<P>
   --That same kid has 38 1/2 minutes of meaningful conversation
with a parent each week.
</P>
<P>
   That last part is what scares me.
</P>
<P>
   ``What we've found is that most kids who watch TV would really
rather be doing something else,'' Labalme says.
</P>
<P>
   Like flying a kite or reading a book or playing Scrabble.
</P>
<P>
   Or, maybe, just talking.
</P>

 &HT;    Even on powerful cycles, bikers no match for Mother Earth
 &HT;    By Rowland Nethaway
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   DAINGERFIELD, Texas _ The driver of the 18-wheeler didn't have
to blow his horn.
</P>
<P>
   I was fully aware of the problem.
</P>
<P>
   He wanted me to move over. So did I.
</P>
<P>
   My motorcycle was squirming wickedly in a muddy tire rut. If I
tried to steer out of the rut away from the oncoming semi, I felt
sure that the bike would fall, possible under the truck's wheels.
</P>
<P>
   During dinner the night before, four of us discussed how this
year's Ozark motorcycle tour was not going as planned.
</P>
<P>
   For one thing, the fifth member of our group was stretched out
in bed with a fever not far from where we were grilling his steaks.
</P>
<P>
   Everyone fully expected him to ride in the morning even if it
meant crawling out of his deathbed.
</P>
<P>
   ``If he can ride tomorrow,'' observed one wit, ``at least he
won't have to worry about it being cold and rainy.'' That was a
lie.
</P>
<P>
   The remark elicited loud laughter from everyone except the
bedridden man's wife. She said we were sicker than her husband.
</P>
<P>
   That was the other thing not going as planned. The weather
forecast called for cold and rain. An unexpected spring cold front
with rain and thunderstorms was coming our way.
</P>
<P>
   A 4 a.m. call alerted everyone that our fevered companion was
indeed prepared to ride. The 6 a.m. departure was pushed back three
hours, however, to give the storm front a chance to pass.
</P>
<P>
   We felt that we had outsmarted Mother Nature when we turned
north off the last of a series of small paved backroads onto U.S.
259 in northeast Texas.
</P>
<P>
   Our plan was to take this main highway up to the ridge-line road
on the Winding Stair Mountain Range in eastern Oklahoma and western
Arkansas. This scenic road is called Skyline Drive or the Talimena
Trail. It's a beautiful road that winds for 60 miles between
Talihina, Okla., and Mena, Ark.
</P>
<P>
   The ``Loose Gravel'' sign got our attention. Loose gravel on a
paved road is an irritant to car drivers. But gravel can cause an
unsuspecting street-riding motorcycle pilot to crash and burn.
</P>
<P>
   But the sign lied. The highway department evidently didn't have
a sign that said ``Hog Wallow.''
</P>
<P>
   Before we knew it, we were in an adrenaline-pumping red mud hole
that stretched from ditch to ditch. The pavement and the road bed
were gone. All that was left was a dirt, clay and sand pig sty.
</P>
<P>
   I was pant-breathing as though I was about to give birth. I slid
to the left of the red wallow. The tractor-trailer truck appeared
in the distance. I tried to move to the right but got trapped in a
deep tire rut that pitched the bike from side to side.
</P>
<P>
   The truck driver blew his horn in case I was daydreaming. Or
perhaps he thought the five of us took the day off so we could
slide our street bikes around in this mud hole.
</P>
<P>
   My left shoulder brushed one of the trailer's tires as we
passed.
</P>
<P>
   It felt like forever before we wriggled out of the mud back onto
the paved highway. All the bikes emerged muddy. One bike and rider
was muddier. He had dumped his bike.
</P>
<P>
   When he went over, the drivers in the cars coming up behind him
were nice enough to not use him or his bike for traction. But they
were not inclined to get out of their cars to help.
</P>
<P>
   Another rider witnessed the dismount in his rear-view mirrors
and slogged back to help pry the downed motorcycle out of the mud.
</P>
<P>
   As we recounted our experiences during the three-mile writhing
traverse of Texas' version of a Third World jungle passage, one
rider remarked that he had not been more frightened than at any
time since he began riding motorcycles.
</P>
<P>
   A few hours later, inching along a 60-mile stretch of mountain
ridge in a cold impenetrable fog, he would re-evaluate this
statement.
</P>
<P>
   Never brag about outsmarting Mother Nature.
</P>

 &HT;    Yard sale brings out the best in people
 &HT;    By Ana Pecina Walker
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   LONGVIEW, Texas _ Having a yard sale is like taking medicine:
you don't really want to do it, but afterwards, you're glad you
did.
</P>
<P>
   You meet the nicest people whose names you'll never know.
</P>
<P>
   My 17-year-old daughter declared that last Saturday we would
have such a sale. She and her friend are raising money to go on a
mission trip to help build a school in Belize this summer. This was
their first fund-raising
</P>
<P>
   project.
</P>
<P>
   I had successfully been putting them off for several weeks,
dreading foraging through cramped closets and venturing into our
garage/jungle. But Kathryn finally prevailed and she and Lauren and
Lauren's mom Mary and I spent Friday evening sticking prices on
everything from shoes to household appliances.
</P>
<P>
   Somehow the moms' motives of getting rid of unneeded items and
the daughters' mission of making lots of money managed to mesh.
Saturday, we rose before dawn so the girls could post signs around
the neighborhood. My favorite was the one on lime green poster
board which said ``Cool Stuff'', followed by our address and an
arrow.
</P>
<P>
   I came away from the sale with several distinct impressions.
</P>
<P>
   First, if you're worried about our children not reading enough,
worry no more. Children of all ages and colors dug through our
selection of books, some looking for specific items like ``The
Babysitters Club'' and some looking for anything they hadn't
already read. One very serious elementary school child wanted books
she could read to her younger sister. Those of you who roll your
eyes at the number of principals who spend time on rooftops trying
to get children to read, scoff no more. It's working.
</P>
<P>
   Second, Longview is a really terrific place. Our yard sale
coincided with the T.O.P.S. convention hosted by the city. T.O.P.S.
stands for Take Off Pounds Sensibly. Several groups of
conventioneers stopped by. One lady
</P>
<P>
   informed us that T.O.P.S. folks are avid garage-salers. They
were also some of the most cheerful people I've ever come across
and they loved Longview.
</P>
<P>
   They raved about the pine trees, the azaleas, the dogwoods and
just the lushness of the entire area. Particularly enthusiastic
about the beauty were the folks from Austin and San Antonio, places
many East Texans love to
</P>
<P>
   visit.
</P>
<P>
   It's nice to see your home through the eyes of others. Makes you
feel better.
</P>
<P>
   Third, God works in wondrous ways. A very quiet gentleman came
to the sale and gave everything a thorough inspection. He made his
selections carefully and methodically: all of my husband's old
shirts, some other clothing and a few toys. He didn't say much as
he was paying for the items and it finally occurred to me he might
not speak English very well. I spoke to him in Spanish. He
responded by telling us he travels to Mexico often and takes
clothing and other items to street people. He said he is helping to
build a school for the street children he works with.
</P>
<P>
   He was thrilled when we told him the reason for our sale.
</P>
<P>
   So were we.

 By STEVE LOHR   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   In a nation of technophiles, where Internet millionaires are
minted daily, it seems heresy to question the economic payoff from
information technology _ the billions upon billions spent each year
by companies and households on everything from computers to
software to cell phones.
</P>
<P>
   But for more than a decade, most of the nation's leading
economists have been heretics. They have not been much impressed by
the high-tech dogma _ embraced by corporate executives, business
school professors and Wall Street alike _ that regards the
transformation of the economy through the magic of information
technology as a self-evident truth.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can see the Computer Age everywhere,'' Robert Solow, a
Nobel prizewinner from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology
wrote a few years ago, ``but in the productivity statistics.''
</P>
<P>
   For years, even as the computer revolutionized the workplace,
productivity _ the output of goods and services per worker _
stagnated, barely advancing 1 percent a year. So it is easy to see
how Solow's pithy comment became the favorite punchline of the
economic naysayers.
</P>
<P>
   Yet today, even renowned skeptics on the subject of technology's
contribution to the economy, like Solow, are having second
thoughts. Productivity growth has picked up, starting in 1996,
capped by a surge in the second half of last year, after eight
years of economic expansion. That has drawn attention because past
upward swings in productivity typically occurred early in a
recovery as economic activity rebounded. Once companies increased
hiring, it slowed again.
</P>
<P>
   But something seems fundamentally different this time, something
apparently having a lot to do with the increased speed and
efficiency that the Internet and other pervasive
information-technology advances are bringing to the mundane
day-to-day tasks of millions of businesses.
</P>
<P>
   The question, posed by economists, is whether the higher
productivity growth, averaging about 2 percent in the last three
years, roughly double the pace from 1973 to 1995, is the
long-awaited confirmation that the nation's steadily rising
investment in computers and communications is finally paying off.
The evidence is starting to point in that direction.
</P>
<P>
   ``My beliefs are shifting on this subject,'' said Solow. ``I am
still far from certain. But the story always was that it took a
long time for people to use information technology and truly become
more efficient. That story sounds a lot more convincing today than
it did a year or two ago.''
</P>
<P>
   Another pillar in the pessimist camp was Daniel Sichel, an
economist at the Federal Reserve. His work, along with another Fed
economist, Stephen Oliner, in 1994, and on his own in 1997, found
that computers contributed little to productivity growth. But
recently, Sichel ran similar calculations for the last few years
and came to a different conclusion.
</P>
<P>
   In a paper that has just been published in the quarterly
``Business Economics,'' Sichel wrote that his new work points to
``a striking step up in the contribution of computers to output
growth.'' And the nation's improved productivity performance, he
noted, is ``raising the possibility that businesses are finally
reaping the benefits of information technology.''
</P>
<P>
   The impact of information technology on the economy is more than
an academic debate. If, as some experts assert, the technology
dividend is a key reason for the nation's extraordinary run of high
growth, rising wages and low inflation, there are significant
policy implications. If the recent gains are not just a temporary
blip, it suggests that the Federal Reserve can be less fearful of
inflation and keep interest rates stable rather than be forced to
raise them to cool off what would otherwise be considered an
overheated economy.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, the Fed chairman, Alan Greenspan, and the other Fed
governors are scheduled to hear presentations on information
technology's effect on the economy from several academics during a
private meeting in Washington on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Greenspan, for one, seems to believe a fundamental change is
under way. He told Congress early this year that the economy was
enjoying ``higher, technology-driven productivity growth.''
</P>
<P>
   The Fed governors will hear a forceful case for technological
optimism from Erik Brynjolfsson, an associate professor at the MIT
Sloan School of Management.
</P>
<P>
   Brynjolfsson asserts that the economic value of speed, quality
improvements, customer service and new products are often not
captured by government statistics. ``These are the competitive
advantages of information technology,'' he said. ``We need a
broader definition of output in this new economy, which goes beyond
the industrial-era concept of widgets coming off the assembly
line.''
</P>
<P>
   The government, after years of defending its figures, conceded
two weeks ago that productivity growth may be understated. The core
of the problem, government economists say, is the increasingly
complex challenge of defining and measuring output in much of the
economy's fast-growing service sector, which includes the vast
reaches of banking, finance, health care and education.
</P>
<P>
   According to the official statistics, a bank today is only about
80 percent as productive as a bank in 1977. Yet that seems to take
scant account of, say, 24-hour automated teller machines, which
clearly benefit customers who no longer have to wait in lines to be
served by human tellers during regular ``bankers' hours.''
</P>
<P>
   Edwin Dean, chief of the productivity division of the Bureau of
Labor Statistics, wrote in a new research paper that the agency was
increasingly concerned that its measurements did not ``fully
reflect changes in the quality of goods and services'' or ``capture
the full impact of new technology on economic performance.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, the government's methods of measurement will not be
overhauled anytime soon. ``These are tough, tough questions and we
are not going to get instant solutions,'' Dean explained in an
interview.
</P>
<P>
   American corporations long ago made up their minds, voting for
technology with their dollars. Investment in information technology
_ computing and telecommunications gear _ has quadrupled over the
last decade, rising as a share of all business spending on
equipment from 29 percent to 53 percent, according to the Commerce
Department. And that is only the hardware. There have been similar
surges in corporate spending on software, consulting, technical
support and training related to the field.
</P>
<P>
   ``The payoff from information technology is unquestionably there
with individual companies and we're seeing it over and over
again,'' said Chuck Rieger, a senior consultant at IBM's services
division.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, anecdotal evidence from individual companies is no
proof of broad-based benefits in an $8.5-trillion economy. But what
many experts find encouraging is that the rapid introduction of
low-cost Internet technology means most companies can now afford to
set up electronic links with customers and suppliers. For example,
a recent survey of 2,500 manufacturing companies, conducted by
PricewaterhouseCoopers, found that the number of factories with
Internet links to customers and suppliers doubled last year.
</P>
<P>
   At more and more companies, these Internet-based networks are
already streamlining the mundane chores of business life like
invoicing, purchasing and inventory control. This is not the
glamorous side of Internet commerce, occupied by Amazon.com and
others selling consumer products. Yet if a technology dividend in
productivity is at hand, the place to look is in the back offices
of business. ``That is where it will be,'' Solow, the MIT
economists, said, ``in the wholesale automation of corporate
transactions.''
</P>
<P>
   This business-to-business commerce over the Internet is
projected to jump from $48 billion in 1998 to $1.5 trillion by
2003, according to Forrester Research Inc. During the same period,
the research firm estimates that consumer sales over Internet will
rise from $3.9 billion to $108 billion.
</P>
<P>
   The service sector of the economy is where productivity gains
appear to have been especially sluggish and where experts are
looking most closely for evidence of an efficiency payoff from
technology.
</P>
<P>
   In Chicago, Michael Rushmore, a banker, speaks of how Internet
computing has ``fundamentally changed the way we do business'' over
the last three or four years. Take the way corporate loans are
syndicated among many banks, notes Rushmore, a managing director of
Nationsbanc Montgomery Securities, the securities arm of
BankAmerica Corp.
</P>
<P>
   Until about two years ago, syndicating a large corporate bank
loan meant distributing a lengthy offering document, often running
more than 200 pages, to 50 to 100 banks. It was, Rushmore recalled,
a nightmarish, inefficient process that involved waves of overnight
mail, constant faxing and armies of messengers.
</P>
<P>
   Today, much of that process is handled over the Internet on bank
Web sites that other banks tap into to read and download the
offering document, ask questions and exchange views. Rushmore
estimates that the Internet-based system trims 25 percent from the
time it takes to close a deal, not just improving the ease of the
transaction but also saving an immense amount of hours of work.
</P>
<P>
   About a year ago Booz Allen &AMP; Hamilton began using the Internet
to bill several federal agencies that are its clients. Booz Allen
estimates that it has saved $150,000 a year by eliminating the
paper handling on its $10 million in monthly billings to the
government. The greater speed and efficiency of the electronic
billing also means that the consulting firm is being paid 30
percent, or six days, faster than before.
</P>
<P>
   ``Getting that money into the bank much more quickly is probably
the biggest benefit,'' said Mark Arnsberger, an assistant
controller for Booz Allen &AMP; Hamilton.
</P>
<P>
   The rapid spread of Internet-based computing, experts say,
promises to compress the time it takes for any new technology to
enhance economic welfare in general. The classic study of the
phenomenon, ``The Dynamo and the Computer: An Historical
Perspective on the Modern Productivity Paradox,'' by Paul David, an
economic historian at Stanford University, was published in 1990.
</P>
<P>
   The electric motor, David noted, was introduced in the early
1880s but did not generate discernible productivity gains until the
1920s. It took that long, he wrote, not only for the technology to
be widely distributed but also for businesses to reorganize work
around the industrial production line, the efficiency breakthrough
of its day.
</P>
<P>
   ``The process takes longer than people think, but I still
believe that we will get a revival of productivity growth led by
the spread of computing,'' David said.
</P>
<P>
   His is a misplaced faith, according to the dwindling band of
techno-pessimists whose own beliefs remain unshaken. Sure, they
concede, there has been surprisingly strong productivity growth for
the last three years. Could this represent a break in the trend?
Possibly, they grudgingly admit, but only a tiny shift at best,
they insist.
</P>
<P>
   The real problem, they explain, lies in the composition of the
nation's vast service economy. More than half of all white-collar
workers are what they term ``knowledge workers'' _ managers,
executives and professionals like doctors, lawyers, teachers, even
economists.
</P>
<P>
   ``The work they do does not lend itself to technology-driven
improvements in productivity, and any gains are really difficult to
eke out and are glacial,'' said Stephen Roach, chief economist at
Morgan Stanley Dean Witter. ``Paul David's electrical motor has
nothing to do with the knowledge-intensive process of work in a
service economy.''
</P>
<P>
   The real technology cynic at the Fed meeting on Thursday will be
Paul Strassmann, a former chief information officer of Xerox and
the Pentagon. Strassmann, author of ``The Squandered Computer,''
published in 1997, believes that corporate America's spending spree
on information technology amounts to an ``economic arms race,''
fueled by misguided management theories.
</P>
<P>
   The recent improvement in productivity, according to Strassmann,
is mainly attributable to the lower cost of capital because of low
interest rates. His summary view, though at odds with those of
technology optimists like Brynjolfsson of MIT, may also be received
warmly by the Fed.
</P>
<P>
   ``The explanation for the productivity improvement is interest
rates, not information technology,'' Strassmann said. ``The hero
here is not Bill Gates. It's Alan Greenspan.''
</P>
<P>
   Yet even Strassmann finds the technology undeniably useful, if
not a productivity elixir. When asked a detailed question, he
replied, ``Just look it up on my Web site. It's a lot more
efficient that way.''

 (Repeating as part of a weekly roundup of computer features)  
High-schoolers set their sights on scholarships via the Web 
By Jennifer Peltz  
c. 1999 Cox News Service  
<TEXT>
<P>
   RIVIERA BEACH, Fla. _ Frank Raucci made his first stab at
designing a World Wide Web page a few months ago. Now he hopes a
Web page will help pay his way through college.
</P>
<P>
   Raucci and his teammate, fellow Suncoast High School senior
Allison Cammerata, are competing for a $25,000 scholarship by
creating a Web site about medieval Europe.
</P>
<P>
   At Palm Beach Gardens High School, senior Justin Slone is also
trying to turn his on-line skills into a scholarship. He and
classmate Gilbert Morejohn are teaming up for an on-line research
contest, with a full scholarship to Florida State University as the
prize.
</P>
<P>
   Just four years after the World Wide Web became widely popular,
Web skills have made their way into the academic mainstream _ so
much so that scholarships are emerging nationwide to reward and
court students who have on-line expertise.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's like any other talent, whether it be music or art or
science or athletics,'' said Timothy McDonough, a spokesman for the
American Council on Education, an organization of 1,800 colleges
and universities. ``Institutions are trying to find a mix of
students . . . (and the Web) is very much a part of the learning
environment now.''
</P>
<P>
   Florida State made that point last year, when it started
offering an on-line research scholarship ``to show that FSU is
connected to learning, to offering students the best in information
services,'' said spokeswoman Fran Conaway.
</P>
<P>
   Competitors search Lexis-Nexis, a giant on-line database of
articles from newspapers and other sources, to answer complex
multiple-choice questions quickly, Conaway said. Thursday is the
deadline to register for this year's contest; the details are
available through the flashing ``Online Scholars Challenge'' icon
(www.fsu.edu).
</P>
<P>
   The contest doesn't sound like too tough a challenge to Slone,
who uses the World Wide Web ``as my main source of research.''
</P>
<P>
   While Slone has worked with computers for years, Raucci is
taking his first computer programming class. But Web design has
come easily enough that Raucci is taking a shot at the worldwide
ThinkQuest Internet Challenge.
</P>
<P>
   ThinkQuest, sponsored by Advanced Network &AMP; Services, a New York
company that helped build the Internet, asks students to design
educational Web sites.
</P>
<P>
   Company President Allan Weis started the contest in 1996 because
he'd found ``nothing that took advantage of all of the power that
the Internet could have'' to teach 11- to 19-year-olds.
</P>
<P>
   ThinkQuest has drawn thousands of entries on subjects from sound
to Shakespeare to the programming language C++, Weis said. This
year's registration deadline has passed, but more information is
available on line (www.thinkquest.org).
</P>
<P>
   ArsDigita, a Boston company, is ready to give $10,000, not for
Web sites but Web services. The company's new contest for students
18 and younger calls for on-line creations that serve a purpose,
such as automatically reminding people to move their cars for
street cleaning.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're trying to get the bar raised in terms of creating useful
and tasteful on-line services,'' ArsDigita programmer Rolf Hanson
explained. The application deadline is May 1 (information is
available at arsdigita.org).
</P>
<P>
   While only a handful of scholarships recognize on-line skills,
some have already specialized by interest and area.
</P>
<P>
   Accounting.net, an on-line information service for accountants,
reserves scholarship money for accounting students who write an
essay explaining how the Internet has changed the profession. A
Chicago Tribune scholarship contest requires Chicago-area students
to create Web sites for nonprofit organizations. In Atlanta, the
Technology Association of Georgia runs a scholarship contest for
Web sites by and about Georgia high school students.
</P>
<P>
   But these new-media scholarships are old news to the makers of
Vivarin, an over-the-counter caffeine pill.
</P>
<P>
   The manufacturers started giving $10,000 scholarships for
interesting Web pages on any subject in 1995, when the Web was just
becoming popular outside computer-science circles. The awards
stopped in 1996.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Internet hit so fast that what was new and unique one year
became just so terribly old-hat the next year,'' scholarship
spokesman Chris Clark explained.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nowadays, college students are starting Internet companies
with (initial) valuations in the billions of dollars, so we feel a
little silly saying, `Show us your cool home page,' '' Clark said.

IT AIN'T HEAVY, IT'S MICROSOFT 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Repeating as part of a weekly roundup of computer features)   By HIAWATHA BRAY   
 c.1999 The Boston Globe   
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ ``Where do you want to go today?'' the Microsoft
Corp. ads lamely inquire. No wonder this outfit has an image
problem.
</P>
<P>
   Here's a livelier slogan, one that accurately describes many
Microsoft products: ``Two pounds in a one-pound bag.''
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft's habit of cramming extra features into each new
product has its benefits. Microsoft's Web browsers, for instance,
are full of clever and delightful gadgets that I didn't know I
needed until I tried them. But often, the same design philosophy
gives you products that are too large and complex to get out of
their own way.
</P>
<P>
   The problem extends even to Microsoft's efforts in the palmtop
computing field. The company's Windows CE operating system
shoehorns a hefty subset of full-fledged Windows into a package
large enough to threaten irreparable harm to your shirt pocket.
</P>
<P>
   I'm on the road this week, visiting several West Coast
technology firms and trying out one of the latest Windows CE
devices _ the Compaq Aero, a $450 personal digital assistant that
offers more assistance than I know what to do with.
</P>
<P>
   I suppose many a gadget freak will freak over the Aero, with its
color touch screen and its built-in sound capabilities. So why does
this product leave me cold?After all, from the standpoint of sheer
technical capability, the Aero impressive. I've been comparing it
to the Palm Pilot IIIx, one of the latest in 3Com's red-hot line of
pocket assistants. And the Palm Pilot's feature list seems rather
paltry compared to the Aero.
</P>
<P>
   The Aero screen is in color, compared to the Palm Pilot's
monochrome. The Aero can download, store and play back music and
spoken-word recordings from the Internet. It's got a built-in
microphone so you can use it as a digital tape recorder during
business meetings. Like the Palm Pilot, the Aero will let you enter
data by writing on the screen, using a modified writing method that
takes hours to master. But the Aero will also let you scrawl notes
in your own handwriting on an electronic notepad that stores an
image of your scribblings.
</P>
<P>
   It's all rather slick. But I soon realized that these fancy
Windows CE extras have almost nothing to do with the way I work.
</P>
<P>
   A color screen? Who needs it? It merely assures that the Aero
will devour more battery power. In fact, the device uses a
rechargeable battery, rather than the cheap standard AAA's that
drive a Palm Pilot.
</P>
<P>
   I had to pack a recharger for the trip, instead of buying spare
batteries at the local Walgreen's. Those rechargeable batteries
also mean extra weight.
</P>
<P>
   I can slip a Palm Pilot into my jacket pocket and almost forget
it's there; the Aero thumps against my chest with every step.
</P>
<P>
   Sound recording? Nice, but it eats up available memory for other
uses. You'll need costly flash memory cards if you want to record
more than a few minutes. It's easier to buy a cheap tape recorder
at Radio Shack.
</P>
<P>
   The notepad? I have terrible handwriting, and the Aero makes it
look worse. Besides, why bother? Has the world run out of paper?
</P>
<P>
   The only Aero features I've found useful are its appointment
calendar, to-do list and address book _ the same features you'll
find in any Palm Pilot. Or, for that matter, in the most underrated
pocket assistant of them all _ Franklin Electronics' Rex, a $100
device only slightly larger than a business card that runs on
disposable watch batteries. I first tried one a couple of years
ago, and I still put the Rex at the top of the list for convenience
and value.
</P>
<P>
   So does Intel chairman Andrew Grove, by the way. Figuring him
for a fellow gadget freak, I showed him my Aero the other day. He
turned up his nose at it and began singing the praises of the Rex.
But you can't jot notes to yourself with a Rex, I noted. ``I just
use paper,'' Grove replied. Me too, Andy.
</P>
<P>
   With its abundance of features, Windows CE may have a bright
future in larger devices like minilaptop computers and interactive
television set-top boxes. But to conquer the palmtop computing
market, Microsoft should either slim down its software or launch a
new line of clothing with oversized, triple-reinforced pockets.

 (Repeating as part of a weekly roundup of computer features)   By SIMSON L. GARFINKLE   
 c.1999 The Boston Globe   
<TEXT>
<P>
   I searched for Drazen Pantic on the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   The first two links that I found were to his resume and home
page. Unfortunately, both of those pages are on computers inside
the ``AC.YU'' domain _ academic computers within the former
Yugoslavia. Needless to say, both of those machines are unreachable
on the Internet today.
</P>
<P>
   Fortunately, I could still find plenty of articles about Pantic,
a professor of mathematics at Belgrade University, who until
recently was the director of OpenNet, the Internet service provider
of Belgrade's formerly independent radio station, B92
(www.b92.net).
</P>
<P>
   The story of OpenNet and B92 clearly demonstrates the power of
the Internet to overcome political oppression _ especially
censorship by dictatorships. In December 1996, when the Serbian
authorities demanded that B92 cease broadcasting, the radio
station's staff sent out its programs over the Internet to
broadcasters outside Serbia, who then re-broadcast the programs
back into the country. Two days later, the Serbian authorities
relented, and allowed B92 back on the air.
</P>
<P>
   This past March, the Serbs banned B92 again, and once again the
radio station started broadcasting on the Internet. ``For something
like almost 10 days, the Internet and air around Serbia was so full
of the B92 signal,'' said Pantic, who spoke last week in Washington
at the annual conference on Computers, Freedom and Privacy.
</P>
<P>
   But alas, the story of OpenNet also shows that even the Internet
is vulnerable to brute force. On April 2nd, the Serbian authorities
sent police to OpenNet, took over the Internet service provider,
and changed the programming. ``That fairy tale could not last
forever,'' said Pantic.
</P>
<P>
   When OpenNet started offering service in November 1995, it was
Belgrade's only Internet service provider. It was sponsored by the
Fund for an Open Society, the organization created by billionaire
financier George Soros that is trying to help the world end
dictatorships and become a collection of open societies. The idea
was to let Serbian citizens get their own news and communicate
freely with the outside world.
</P>
<P>
   But the dictatorship started opening its own Internet providers
in March 1996; Pantic says that these providers are one-way
organizations, designed to carry propaganda to the citizens.
Recently, they have also been used to attack the NATO Web site and
to send unwanted junk e-mail advocating the Serbian cause.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Pantic has tried mightily to assure freedom and
privacy. He has used encryption and remote storage to protect
OpenNet's users, even when they didn't want to be protected .
</P>
<P>
   Fundamentally, encryption is a technique for foiling wiretaps.
In the beginning, OpenNet taught seminars on how to use encryption
programs like PGP (Pretty Good Privacy), but even in this
life-threatening situation, few of Pantic's users wanted to deal
with the complexity of encryption. ``PGP has this unpleasant thing
that it is not user-friendly,'' Pantic said .
</P>
<P>
   So instead, OpenNet created an encrypted tunnel between
OpenNet's computer in Belgrade and the Internet service provider
XS4ALL in Amsterdam, where OpenNet stored all of its subscribers'
e-mail and Web pages. When an OpenNet user in Belgrade checked his
mail, the messages would automatically be encrypted when they were
sent from XS4ALL's computers in Amsterdam to OpenNet's computer in
Belgrade, than decrypted when the message was sent from OpenNet to
the end user.
</P>
<P>
   This encryption system wasn't perfect: Serb authorities couldn't
eavesdrop on the communications between OpenNet and XS4ALL, but
they could wiretap OpenNet's own modems and eavesdrop on the actual
messages as they were being sent to subscribers.
</P>
<P>
   But Pantic, when I spoke with him, didn't think that
</P>
<P>
   this was a much of a problem: modem transmissions are much
harder to eavesdrop on than high-speed, long-distance data lines.
Even so, said Pantic, after the encrypted tunnel was installed, the
Serbs cut the data line every Saturday around noon. They were
hoping, he said, that by watching the tunnel start up, they might
be able to figure out how it was working.
</P>
<P>
   But despite these minor technological triumphs, it's important
to remember that the wonders of the Internet were only available to
people in Belgrade who had access to computers. Indeed, in many
parts of the world, repressive regimes work hand-in-hand with
economics to restrict access to the freedom of information that the
on-line world holds.
</P>
<P>
   Nowhere is this partnership more evident than in China,
explained Bobson Wong, of the Digital Freedom Network, who spoke at
the same conference last week.
</P>
<P>
   Search the Web site of the British Broadcasting Corporation for
stories about the Internet and China, said Wong, and you'll come up
with articles talking about human rights abuses , and China's
decision to filter access to the Internet to remove pornography and
information about democratic rights. ``You do that same search on
Chinese Daily and you get a whole bunch of stories about the high
cost of Internet access and the lack of content.''
</P>
<P>
   A current survey of Chinese Internet users found that the
Internet was ``too slow, too expensive, and too English,'' said
Wong. ``Most of the Web is in English, and most people in China do
not read English. So most of the Internet users in China are
well-educated, they are students or work in computers, and they are
pretty well off.''
</P>
<P>
   The most telling statistic, he said, is this: ``The average cost
of a computer in China is about $1,000. But the per capita income
for urban city residents, as of 1997, is $620. A lot of people in
China save for computers the way people in America save for cars.''
Or for houses.
</P>
<P>
   The Internet has a great capacity for effecting social change.
The free flow of information changes societies from within, that's
why the regimes in Belgrade and Beijing fear giving their citizenry
unrestricted access. Unfortunately, in any battle between guns and
modems, one simple fact gives guns the upper hand: You can't kill
somebody with a modem, but you can with a gun.

 c 1999, San Francisco Chronicle  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR; Question: &LR;  I live in San Francisco and am committed to my
Microsoft Windows 95 system. My daughter lives in Hawaii and is
committed to her Macintosh, because she is a teacher and they use
Macs at her school. Is it possible to exchange floppies so I can do
some typing work for her, or do we need special equipment?
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Answer: &LR;  If you're using the same software _ i.e., Microsoft
Word on both platforms _ you can ``sneaker-net'' files on floppies.
Use disks formatted for a PC, because Macs can read them thanks to
a nifty bit of software called PC Exchange that comes with the Mac.
PCs can't read disks formatted for a Mac.
</P>
<P>
   You might want to try having your daughter simply e-mail the
documents to you as attachments. If you're both using Microsoft
Word, you should be able to open the documents, work on them and
send them back to her. If you're using different word processors,
have her save the documents in RTF format before e-mailing them.
That will preserve much of the formatting while guaranteeing that
you can open the files.
</P>
<P>
   You've Got Mail, Sort Of
</P>
<P>
   Q: I have a question regarding the e-mail function in America
Online. I would like to be able to use Microsoft Outlook to send
and receive e-mail instead of the default e-mail client that comes
with AOL. Is that possible?
</P>
<P>
   A: Unfortunately not. Although most Internet service providers
let you use any e-mail program, including Microsoft Outlook,
America Online subscribers are stuck with AOL's proprietary Mail
system. There used to be a program called Claris Emailer, which
worked with AOL on Macintosh computers, but it's no longer being
made.
</P>
<P>
   That having been said, there is a way that AOL users can send
and receive mail even when they're away from a computer that has
AOL's software. It's called AOL NetMail, and it lets you access
your messages from any computer with an Internet connection and a
browser. All you do is go to www.aol.com /netmail/ and sign onto
your account as you normally would. A Web-based version of your AOL
mailbox is displayed that provides most of the features you'd
normally get. You can write a new message, delete an old one and
check messages you've sent.
</P>
<P>
   Tidying Up the Desktop
</P>
<P>
   Q: I have had a problem removing icons from my desktop that
involve applications I have downloaded from the Internet. Whenever
I try to remove these icons, I get a message saying that if I
delete the icon, I will not be able to run the application. My
desktop is cluttered with these icons. Please help.
</P>
<P>
   A: Most of the icons are probably the installation files that
you downloaded (you double-clicked these files to install the
programs, right?) If that's the case, you can safely delete the
icons. The only reason you might want to save one is if it's a huge
file and you think you might have to reinstall it. By keeping it,
you wouldn't have to go through a long download again.
</P>
<P>
   It's possible that an icon could represent the actual working
program, in which case deleting it would disable the program. But
that's highly unlikely. I don't know of any program that installs
itself right on the Windows Desktop.
</P>
<P>
   Some of your icons also probably are shortcuts _ tiny links that
let you start programs from the desktop. If you go to delete one of
these icons, you won't get a warning message. By right-clicking an
icon and choosing Properties, you'll see right away whether you're
dealing with a shortcut or a program file of some sort.
</P>
<P>
   No Warm Welcome AtHome
</P>
<P>
   Q: I subscribed to AtHome two months ago and have experienced
outages and lethargic connections. Customer service is as close to
nonexistent as possible with this company. When calling by phone,
one is greeted with a standard message about unusually high call
volume and a wait of a minimum of 30 minutes. I have sent six
e-mails concerning service and have never received a reply. Is
there any recourse when an Internet service provider does not
respond? I've invested a couple hundred dollars in startup costs.
</P>
<P>
   A: There's no excuse for AtHome not responding to your queries.
Who do they think they are, anyway, the phone company? Why don't
you call one of their PR people and leave a complaint on the voice
mail: Try Matt Wolfrom at (650) 569-5195 or Molly Lynch at (650)
569-5555. Don't expect them to call back _ heck, they don't even
call me back sometimes. But at least they'll know they've got a
problem.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
TIP OF THE WEEK
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   If you turn off your PC without going through the proper
procedure to shut down Windows, you may be treated to a delay the
next time you start it as Windows goes through a screening process
to make the system's all right. That takes only a minute or so, but
it's irritating. So here's what you do: As soon as the blue screen
appears and the screening process starts, hit the Enter key. That
will abort the process and immediately launch Windows.

 Chip Here, Drive There, You're Done  
 By David Einstein   
 c 1999, San Francisco Chronicle   
<TEXT>
<P>
   By building your own PC, you can:
</P>
<P>
   A: Save a lot of money.
</P>
<P>
   B: Skin your knuckles.
</P>
<P>
   C: Ruin a weekend.
</P>
<P>
   D: Have something to boast about at the next office party.
</P>
<P>
   If you picked B, C and D, you win. But if you think you'd save
money by putting together a computer from scratch, think again.
You'd be lucky to match the price PC-makers are charging these days
in their zeal to undercut the competition.
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, you can build yourself a bare-bones multimedia
system for well under $1,000 and a high-powered one for under
$1,500. And the best part is you have control over what goes in it.
You can select the components that fit you.
</P>
<P>
   Suppose, for example, that you're into gaming. By constructing
your own PC, you can include the latest 3-D graphics card and a
state-of-the-art sound card, rather than settling for the
less-robust multimedia technology that comes with most PCs.
</P>
<P>
   If you have a logical mind, are fairly good with your hands and
possess the patience of Job, there's no reason you can't skip steps
B and C above and build a PC. And if you do it right, it probably
will only take a couple of hours. Believe it or not, computers go
together pretty easily, thanks to industry standard connections for
all major components.
</P>
<P>
   To become your own computer company, you'll need these
components (you can get them at a big computer store or by mail
from a catalog company such as Tiger Direct at
www.tigerdirect.com):
</P>
<P>
   &UR; _Case for the system &LR; : around $60. Cases come in desktop or
tower models, and they usually include a power supply with
connections for various components.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; _Motherboard &LR; : $75 to $150. This is the big green circuit board
to which everything else inside the case attaches. Get one that
includes connection ports for the keyboard, mouse, printer and
other peripherals.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; _Processor, such as a Pentium II, a Celeron or an AMD K6 &LR; : $100
for a 333 MHz chip to $750 for a Pentium II 500.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; _Memory chips &LR; : $100 for 64 megabytes.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; _Hard drive &LR; : $175 for 8 megabytes.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; _CD-ROM drive &LR; : $75.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; _Floppy drive &LR; : $35.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; _A long drive in the country &LR; . That comes later and helps you
forget all about the PC.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; _Video card and sound card:  &LR; $50 to $200 (video card); $30 to
$100 (sound card). These aren't necessary if you get a motherboard
that comes with built-in sound and video.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; _Keyboard &LR; : $30 to $50.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; _Mouse &LR; : $15 to $50.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; _Modem:  &LR; $50.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; _Monitor &LR; : $225 for 17-inch model.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; _Speakers &LR; : $30 to $100.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; _Windows 98 &LR; : $170, includes some starter software.
</P>
<P>
   You can also buy bare-bones kits that include the motherboard
with sound, video and a case at a discount.
</P>
<P>
   For the most part, PC components are interchangeable. Any floppy
drive, modem or monitor will work in any system. Motherboards,
however, are designed for specific processors, so make sure to
choose a motherboard that works with the chip you get.
</P>
<P>
   Also, look for a motherboard with enough expansion slots to
accommodate cards you may install for sound, video and other
peripherals.
</P>
<P>
   To turn all this stuff into a PC, you'll need a screwdriver and
perhaps a small wrench. Set up a work area that's free of static,
because static can fry your motherboard and other components.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, have at the ready instruction manuals that came
with the parts. They'll be useful.
</P>
<P>
   First, connect the processor to the motherboard. If you have a
Celeron or Pentium II, you'll need a special mounting bracket. And
don't forget to plug the chip's fan into the motherboard. Powerful
chips need to stay cool.
</P>
<P>
   Then plug the memory chip or chips into the motherboard.
</P>
<P>
   Attach the motherboard to the case. Then connect the power
supply to the motherboard.
</P>
<P>
   (Safety note: Don't plug the case into the wall until you're all
done, OK? Wouldn't want to lose a reader to electrocution.)
</P>
<P>
   With the motherboard installed, you can mount the hard drive,
the floppy drive and the CD-ROM. They slide into the case from the
front and are secured with screws that come with the case or with
the devices.
</P>
<P>
   Each drive must be connected to the motherboard with a flat
cable (also called a ribbon cable) that comes with the drive. Also
hook up each drive to a plug extending from the power supply.
</P>
<P>
   The case has a power button, a speaker and lights to show when
various drives are in use. You'll have to attach the wires for
those things to the motherboard, which should have clearly marked
connectors along one side.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, install audio, video and other cards, such as an
internal modem. You can put them into any slot they fit. And don't
forget to connect the CD-ROM drive to the sound card, so you can
listen to music CDs.
</P>
<P>
   That's it, the hard part's over. Check the motherboard manual
for instructions on starting the system. You also probably will
have to install setup software for the hard drive, the video and
sound cards and the modem.
</P>
<P>
   There, that wasn't too hard, was it? Was it? You still there?
Hello????

SIZING UP PALM V, AERO 2100 PALMTOPS
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Repeating as part of a weekly roundup of computer features)  By DWIGHT SILVERMAN  
c.1999 Houston Chronicle  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Folks who like to use handheld computers _ a k a palmtops or
personal digital assistants _ are downright religious about them.
</P>
<P>
   Not only can the devices help simplify and organize a hectic
life, but a user looks so darned cool when whipping one out.
</P>
<P>
   But here's the ugly truth about palmtops _ most of them end up
occupying space in sock drawers. While a lot of tech-savvy types
like the idea of organizing their contacts, appointments, notes and
even e-mail in a machine you can fit in a jacket pocket, usually
they are more trouble than they are worth.
</P>
<P>
   The undisputed leader of this genre is Palm Computing's line of
Palm organizers, which has won the passion of handheld users in a
way that was once the purview of the now-defunct Apple Newton.
</P>
<P>
   The Palm line is being challenged by a slew of devices that use
Microsoft's Windows CE operating system. But Palm is standing firm,
with well over 70 percent of the market.
</P>
<P>
   Here's a look at the latest, thinnest Palm organizer, and a
colorful challenger from Houston's Compaq Computer Corp.
</P>
<P>
   __ Palm V _ $449, 3Com/Palm Computing. The emphasis with Palm's
devices has always been on simplicity. From the earliest model, the
Palm Pilot, up to this slick, sleek entry, the focus has been on
making its use easy and intuitive.
</P>
<P>
   Now, with the Palm V, it's stylish, too.
</P>
<P>
   The Palm V is about half the thickness of the Palm IIIx, an
updated version of the Palm III, the company's mainstream product.
It's encased in a brushed metal case and sports a super-clear new
display with a higher resolution than past models.
</P>
<P>
   There are many nifty touches to its design, which is aimed at
style-conscious executives who are willing to pay for a digital
fashion statement.
</P>
<P>
   For example, there are grooves on the left and right edges of
the Palm V. You can place a stylus in one groove, and the spine of
a leather cover in the other.
</P>
<P>
   Because they are interchangeable, the Palm V can be configured
for either right- or left-handers.
</P>
<P>
   Those who are used to using Palm devices will be most struck by
the display, which is a dramatic improvement. Text and graphics are
crisper in plain light.
</P>
<P>
   But the handheld's backlight _ which renders everything a fuzzy
green _ still leaves a lot to be desired.
</P>
<P>
   The Palm V has 2 megabytes of memory, which sounds small but can
hold a lot _ 3,000 appointments, 6,000 addresses or 200 e-mail
messages. An optional 2-MB upgrade can boost the Palm V up to the 4
MB level of the Palm IIIx.
</P>
<P>
   One handy option is a modem designed just for the Palm V that
snaps onto the back of it. It makes the Palm V about the same size
as the Palm III series, and enables you to get your e-mail
wirelessly.
</P>
<P>
   There is excellent software that lets you enter information via
your PC, then synchronize it to the Palm device. A new feature that
comes with the software for the Palm V provides a direct
connection, or ``conduit,'' to Microsoft's Outlook contact manager.
</P>
<P>
   There are two big drawbacks to the Palm V. First is its reliance
on handwriting recognition. Palm uses a program called Graffitti,
first found on the Newton, that requires users to learn a
simplified set of letters.
</P>
<P>
   Although it improves handwriting recognition in general, it
still will frustrate those whose handwriting is less than
letter-perfect _ like mine.
</P>
<P>
   An onscreen keyboard is available, but it also can be
frustrating.
</P>
<P>
   Aero 2100 _ $449 and up, Compaq Computer Corp. The Aero
resurrects the name of a subnotebook computer that Compaq peddled
in the 486 processor era.
</P>
<P>
   Beset with problems, the original Aero died a deserved death
when the Pentium processor began migrating into notebooks.
</P>
<P>
   The Aero 2100 uses the Windows CE operating system, which uses a
stripped-down version of the Windows 95/98 desktop.
</P>
<P>
   The Aero also has an interesting active-matrix color screen,
which sets it apart from most other Windows CE color handhelds,
which use less-clear passive-matrix displays. The screen is
viewable even outside.
</P>
<P>
   The Aero 2100 is a bulky thing, certainly larger than the Palm V
and even bigger than the older Palm III design. It felt comfortable
in my hand, which is relatively large, but probably would feel
oversized in smaller paws.
</P>
<P>
   Taking its size into account, the Aero's designers have added a
rocker switch on its side that lets you scroll through lists by
moving it up or down. This makes it easy to get through data using
just one hand, such as when you're talking on the phone.
</P>
<P>
   There are several models, with either 8 or 16 MB of memory, and
it can hold up to 24 MB.
</P>
<P>
   It also has many more bells and whistles than the Palm line _
and you can take that literally. It comes with a built-in voice
recorder for making quick audio notes, and can work with audio
files downloaded from the Audible.com Web site at www.audible.com.
</P>
<P>
   The color, audio and other nifty features account for the
weight. And they also extract a price in battery life.
</P>
<P>
   While the Palm V can last for more than a week on a charge, the
Aero will give you about 10 hours of service.

DID YOUR WIDDLE COMPUTER GO BOOM?
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Repeating as part of a weekly roundup of computer features)  By DR. EMILIO BOMBAY  
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram  
<TEXT>
<P>
   DEAR DR. BOMBAY: I recently had my computer upgraded to Windows
98. Since that time I frequently experience a situation that
results in my machine stopping completely.
</P>
<P>
   _ Going Nowhere Fast
</P>
<P>
   DEAR NOWHERE: We computer professionals refer to that situation
as ``another satisfied Microsoft customer.'' It generally occurs
when Windows thinks it knows more about your hardware than you do.
</P>
<P>
   During installation, Win98 scans your computer, decides how
stuff should be set up, tweaks itself, then forwards all your
personal information, bank account numbers, shoe size and your
permanent record from high school to Microsoft. Well, maybe I
exaggerate a bit, but the point is that the upgrade program can
occasionally mess up no matter what all the hype out of Redmond
says. And I was never tardy as much as they said.
</P>
<P>
   Make sure you have at least 32MB of memory, no matter what the
smiling salesman tells you. Assuming your hardware is adequate _
oh, get your mind out of the gutter _ you now need to deconstruct
your computer. Remove all the peripherals and unload their driver
programs until all you have left are the drives, motherboard,
monitor and mouse. Now start adding things back in one at a time,
making sure each thing functions the way it's supposed to.
</P>
<P>
   If something hangs up during this, you have some sort of
hardware conflict. Right-click on My Computer, then select
Properties, then Device Manager. Check the properties of each
peripheral, and if you find a conflict, try setting the resources
manually.
</P>
<P>
   If none of that works, hit Control-Alt-Delete, which should
bring up a list of all the stuff in the background. I know it looks
like the software engineers just combined random letters to make
obscure, noninformative program names in an underhanded attempt to
scare you out of shutting one down, but don't be afraid. The worst
that can happen if you select one and click on End Task is that
you'll crash, and you're already doing that. Most systems can get
by just running Explorer and Systray.
</P>
<P>
   If you think one of the background programs is the culprit, run
Msconfig.exe, which will let you selectively remove all things from
the start-up process. Gee, see how much faster Windows loads now?
</P>
<P>
   In the event all that doesn't make a difference, it's time to
nuke the machine and start from scratch. Or try the ``uncrashable''
freebie operating system Linux, as if anybody could actually
install it without an engineering degree from the Institute of
Applied Dweebology.
</P>
<P>
   DEAR DR. BOMBAY: I'm looking for a site where I can put in a
phone number and find out who it belongs to. I swear I'm not some
neurotic homemaker trying to find out who that bimbo is who keeps
calling my husband and hanging up whenever I answer.
</P>
<P>
   _ Wrong Number
</P>
<P>
   DEAR NUM: Please don't call my editor a bimbo. Her love life is
just a little confused right now. You can find her name and address
by going to www.reversephonedirectory.com and trying one of several
lookup services. One of them also identifies her neighbors, but
please don't start calling them and telling them what a trampy
little home wrecker she is.
</P>
<P>
   (Noted computerologist Dr. Emilio Bombay would never use the
above trick to harass anyone unless the hussy really deserved it.

 At the Computer Chip Factory, These Bunnies Just Keep Goin'  
 By Dan Fost   
 c 1999, San Francisco Chronicle   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Roseville, Placer County _ It looks like an astronaut's
convention.
</P>
<P>
   A phalanx of white-suited workers, with no skin visible except
their eyes, begins to file off of the NEC Electronics computer-chip
factory floor just before 6 a.m.
</P>
<P>
   They enter a crammed locker room, where workers on the next
shift are already donning their bunny suits, getting ready for 12
hours in the fab (short for ``fabrication'').
</P>
<P>
   Bunny suits _ so dubbed because of a wearer's resemblance to the
Easter bunny, sans ears and tail _ are a peculiarity of the
semiconductor industry. Microchips must be manufactured in ``clean
rooms'' devoid of any microscopic particles that could wreck them.
Workers wear the encompassing suits to ensure that nothing _ not
the thread from their clothes, not little flakes from their skin,
not a speck of dust _ gets on the delicate chips.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you look at a chip under a microscope, it's like a
city,'' said Hank Halverson, a line maintenance technician. ``A
particle on that chip is about as big as an asteroid landing in the
middle of that city.''
</P>
<P>
   Spending a day surrounded by humming equipment and white-suited
workers, is like science fiction, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Imagine being in a sauna for 12 hours,'' said another worker.
</P>
<P>
   Roughly 74,000 people across the country work in clean rooms
building semiconductors, according to Robert McIlvaine, an Illinois
consultant who serves the industry. That accounts for nearly
one-third of all employees in the $67 billion U.S. chip industry.
</P>
<P>
   In the Bay area, Area, workers don bunny suits in sophisticated
development fabs run by companies such as Intel, Advanced Micro
Devices, National Semiconductor and LSI Logic. Most local fabs are
in Silicon Valley, near their companies' corporate headquarters.
</P>
<P>
   While many workers in the industry are scientists and Ph.D.s
trying to make chips get faster, smaller and cheaper _ and put them
to use in everything from computers to clocks _ many other workers
are the average folks who don bunny suits and actually build the
chips.
</P>
<P>
   ``Here is where the rubber meets the road,'' said Halverson, who
has worked at the fab since it opened 15 years ago. ``This is where
we make the product that the company makes money on.''
</P>
<P>
   NEC Electronics is the U.S. chip-making arm of a giant Japanese
conglomerate. The $40 billion parent company is the second-largest
maker of computer chips in the world after Intel Corp. NEC
Electronics employs 1,600 people in Roseville. Of those, 800 work
in the fab.
</P>
<P>
   NEC is also building a new $1.4 billion fab across the street
from the plant where Halverson works. The chips made in Roseville
go into every type of electronic product on the market today. NEC
uses them in computers, cell phones and hundreds of other products,
and it also sells them to other manufacturers around the world.
</P>
<P>
   The plant produces more than 30,000 six-inch wafers per month,
and each wafer can contain hundreds of chips.
</P>
<P>
   Despite their importance to the industry, bunny suits were
largely unknown to the average person until Intel's blitz of TV
advertisements that featured break dancers in pastel space-age
bunny suits. But the ads didn't explain what they did, or why
they're in the suits.
</P>
<P>
   Clean rooms have been around since the 1940s and the early
nuclear labs, according to George Miller, editor of CleanRooms
magazine. When engineers found their gyroscopes were inaccurate,
the culprit ``was basically dust,'' he said. ``It just wasn't a
clean environment.''
</P>
<P>
   Now the chip industry's bunny-suited workers may be an
endangered species. McIlvaine, the industry consultant, said
automation will render the bunny suit obsolete in several years.
</P>
<P>
   ``The wafer fab of the future won't have people in bunny suits,
but robots handling wafers and moving from station to station,''
McIlvaine said.
</P>
<P>
   NEC's Roseville fab is already moving in that direction. ``You
want to remove the human factor,'' said Enrico Cano, a manager in
the process engineering department. Any time a person handles a
wafer, it could get contaminated or damaged.
</P>
<P>
   Robots are already hard at work at NEC, only they're not the
sort of humanoid robots envisioned in ``Lost in Space.''
</P>
<P>
   Some are simple small boxes, moving about on overhead tracks
like the trolley in ``Mr. Rogers' Neighborhood,'' delivering wafers
to and from the fab. The wafers are shiny silicon disks, six inches
in diameter, on which the microchips are built.
</P>
<P>
   Other robots, bigger and boxier, glide along tracks on the
floor, moving blue boxes of wafers around the fab. One of these
robots chimes ``Mary Had A Little Lamb'' to keep people from
bumping into it as it goes about its business. It deposits the box
at a mechanized station, where another robot uses a suction cup arm
to open the box. Another arm then plucks out a wafer, looking like
an old-fashioned turntable arm ready to put its stylus to an album,
and sets it into some machinery.
</P>
<P>
   And what machinery: Each of those square machines may look like
a common dishwasher, but they can cost millions of dollars, and
they perform tasks of mind-boggling complexity.
</P>
<P>
   A single wafer goes through as many as 600 process steps,
involving more than 100 machines. It can take weeks before a wafer
is ready to be cut into chips and sent to market.
</P>
<P>
   The robots enable NEC's workers to wear a different breed of
bunny suits.
</P>
<P>
   The NEC bunny suits are not what Halverson called ``The Empire
Strikes Back'' variety. In those suits, which remain de rigeur in
90 percent of the country's 1,500 semiconductor clean rooms,
workers wear helmets and special apparatus filtering their every
breath.
</P>
<P>
   Such suits can take an hour to put on. But at NEC, workers wear
a polyester-type material (made by a North Carolina company called
Techstyles) that slips over their street clothes in minutes.
</P>
<P>
   A room full of indistinguishable workers may look like the
ultimate totalitarian nightmare, but workers say it's actually very
democratic. ``You can wear a comic book T-shirt and be viewed as
totally professional if you act that way,'' Halverson said. ``You
are judged by how you perform and how you communicate, because
everybody's dressed the same.''
</P>
<P>
   The fab occupies most of the middle floor of the building; the
first and third floors are all part of an elaborate ventilation
system. Once inside the fab, it's not hard to see why: Signs
everywhere warn of toxic gases. Some particularly ominous pipes are
labeled ``Acid Exhaust.''
</P>
<P>
   There are no ``Dilbert'' cartoons tacked up in the fab _ only
signs warning of danger everywhere. Dangerous gases. Dangerous
voltages.
</P>
<P>
   But the workers, while keeping conscious of safety, don't show
signs of alarm. Even people in bunny suits like to have some fun.
Halverson describes people break dancing, and he said one criteria
for new employees is how well they sing. He describes one colleague
as ``the guy who can hit all the high notes in `Bennie and the
Jets.'''
</P>
<P>
   Such cheer belies the more difficult aspects of the job.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's tedious,'' said Steven McComb, who operates machines
known as steppers that expose the wafers to ultraviolet light.
``Sometimes you get little sores on your hands from the gloves.
Your boots get stinky. You can't chew gum in there.''
</P>
<P>
   Itches are difficultto cope with, bathroom breaks are rare, and,
in Halverson's words, ``sneezing into your own face mask is
unpleasant.''
</P>
<P>
   Dianna Petifer, a production operator, said the constant hum of
machinery and background music wears on her nerves. ``When I get
home, I can't stand any noise,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   But Petifer, 51, doesn't complain. She has only a high school
degree and left a 10-year career in retail for the fab nine years
ago. ``I couldn't go anywhere else with the education I have and
make the money I do,'' she said. Workers in the fab make anywhere
from $13 to $35 an hour.
</P>
<P>
   The 12-hour shifts are a holdover from when it took an hour to
suit up. Many workers now prefer the long days, because it gives
them three days off. Every other week, they're paid overtime for
the long hours.
</P>
<P>
   As the day winds down, Petifer, McComb, Halverson and their
colleagues go to the locker room, slip out of their bunny suits and
head for home.
</P>
<P>
   While they rush for the door, the next shift arrives, having run
errands and slept during the day.
</P>
<P>
   ``Your evenings are precious, and you've got to be a miser with
your time,'' Halverson said. ``When you get unsmocked, you've got
two or three hours, and then you need to get to sleep and get ready
for the next day.''

APPLE MEDIA SOFTWARE CHALLENGES 2 RIVALS 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Repeating as part of a weekly roundup of computer features)   By JOHN MARKOFF   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   CUPERTINO, Calif. _ In a direct challenge to both the Microsoft
Corp. and Real Networks Inc., Apple Computer on Monday introduced a
new version of its Quicktime multimedia software designed to permit
computer users to receive video and audio programming over the
Internet.
</P>
<P>
   The distribution of multimedia content is emerging as one of the
hottest businesses on the Internet. Last week in Hollywood,
Microsoft announced its own technology in the field, known as MS
Audio 4.0, and the International Business Machines Corp. and Sony
Inc. announced an agreement to make their competing systems
compatible with each other.
</P>
<P>
   All three companies, plus a handful of other developers, large
and small, are vying to produce the technology that will ultimately
be adopted as the standard by the recording industry. That industry
is deeply concerned about the rapid growth of a vibrant cottage
industry around the MP3 audio standard, a format for storing audio
files.
</P>
<P>
   Because MP3 has no built-in copyright protection schemes, the
recording industry views it as a serious threat; hundreds of
thousands of MP3 users are already exchanging music over the
Internet without paying musicians or record companies.
</P>
<P>
   Multimedia programs _ incorporating audio, video, and computer
graphics _ can be played on computers in two basic ways: streaming
media, which delivers the program as the user watches or listens,
and downloaded media, which is delivered in its entirety to the
user's hard drive and then viewed or heard. Programming can
originate from television or radio broadcasts or from recorded
music.
</P>
<P>
   Until now, the battle over the market for Internet viewing of
multimedia presentations has largely been between Microsoft, which
has built many of the most popular formats into its Windows Media
Player, and Real Networks, maker of the Realplayer streaming
software. However, analysts said Monday that Apple's strategy would
probably make it a three-way race.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to announcing an initial public test, or beta, for
Quicktime 4, Apple said it would offer software that would make it
possible for server computers using its Mac OS X operating system
to distribute multimedia content over the Internet. They said the
server software would support a streaming technology that has been
defined as a standard by an Internet engineering task force backed
by many companies.
</P>
<P>
   Separately, at the National Association of Broadcasters meeting
in Las Vegas, Apple executives said Monday that its new server
software would have the support of several key hardware
manufacturers, including Cisco Systems, IBM, Silicon Graphics Inc.
and Sun Microsystems.
</P>
<P>
   The result will be relatively inexpensive server computers that
will allow independent artists or small businesses to offer
programming to large audiences over the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   Industry analysts said Monday that Apple should have a
significant advantage in the market for Internet multimedia
software since much of the multimedia material already offered on
line was originally created in the Quicktime format.
</P>
<P>
   ``It depends on the media,'' said Andrew Gore, editor in chief
of Macworld magazine. ``For movies, they have a tremendous
advantage. However, for live video, Microsoft has made a
significant inroad.''
</P>
<P>
   Apple officials said Monday that the company's strategy was
different from those of both Real Networks, which charges a
licensing fee for its server software, and Microsoft, which offers
its server technology only on the proprietary Windows NT operating
system. Because Apple is releasing the source code for its server
software, it will be simple for organizations that want to transmit
multimedia material to adapt their own systems. Phil Schiller,
Apple's vice president for worldwide marketing, said the company
would make an effort to insure that the new Quicktime software
incorporates a wide variety of different media formats known as
``codecs'' (for compression-decompression), bodies of software
coding that transform audio and video programming into digital
format for transmission and translate it back on the user's
computer. ``We support more codecs than anyone in the world,''
Schiller said.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, in recent months the competition in the streaming media
market has shifted to a battle to demonstrate the highest quality
in codecs. While it is hard to tell the differences when one is
using a modem that delivers speeds of 56,000 bits a second,
Schiller said, the rapid shift among consumers to high-speed cable
modems and digital subscriber lines, is making distinctions more
apparent.
</P>
<P>
   The Quicktime 4 viewer can be downloaded free by both Windows
and Macintosh users from Apple's Web site. A $29.95 version lets
users create and edit digital content. And separately, Apple said
Monday that it had begun shipping professional video authoring
software.

ANALYSIS: NEXT CHIEF OF COMPAQ MAY HAVE TO REINVENT IT 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Repeating as part of a weekly roundup of computer features)   By LAWRENCE M. FISHER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   As Compaq Computer Corp. begins its search for a new chief
executive, it is clear that the prospective leader's first
challenge will be to chart a course from the brick-and-mortar
retailers that have been the company's lifeblood to the
direct-sales model that is increasingly defining the industry's
future, analysts and consultants said Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Eckhard Pfeiffer, 57, was dismissed over the weekend by Compaq's
board, led by a company co-founder, Benjamin Rosen. Earl Mason,
Compaq's chief financial officer, also resigned to become chief
executive at an unidentified company. The announcement came nine
days after Compaq warned that its first-quarter income would be
about half what analysts expected.
</P>
<P>
   Compaq's problems stem from a strategy that has appeared to pull
the company in opposite directions at the same time.
</P>
<P>
   On one hand, it has struggled to compete in the
personal-computer market with Dell Computer Corp., which sells
directly to buyers, avoiding the dealer channel and its markup, and
builds each machine to order, keeping inventories and costs at a
minimum.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, Compaq, though its acquisitions of Digital
Equipment Corp. last year and Tandem Computer in 1997, has tried to
become a major systems company, like IBM Corp. and Hewlett-Packard.
</P>
<P>
   ``It seems to me that Compaq's strategy has been unraveling for
quite a few years now,'' said Regis McKenna, president of McKenna
Group, a management consulting firm based in Palo Alto, Calif.
``They're caught between the low end and the high end, and that's
why you see them constantly changing their mind. The first thing
they have to do is figure out what they want to be when they grow
up.''
</P>
<P>
   Pfeiffer succeeded Compaq's first chief executive, another
co-founder, Rod Canion, in 1991, in a coup also led by Rosen. He
aggressively lowered Compaq's cost structure to meet the challenge
of new competition, and the reduced costs allowed the Houston-based
company to gain the computer industry's leading market share while
maintaining decent profit margins.
</P>
<P>
   But by the late 1990s, as Compaq embraced the sub-$1,000 PC, its
growth came at the expense of profit margins.
</P>
<P>
   About 18 months ago, Compaq announced that it was moving to a
build-to-order business model, similar to Dell's, but that it would
retain its traditional distribution through the dealer channel, as
well.
</P>
<P>
   Although Compaq did reduce internal inventory levels, it has
never matched Dell's operating efficiency, and it has continued to
lag behind Dell in growth. Dell has systematically sought out
Compaq's strongest markets, first in laptops and then in servers
and work stations, and has gained market share in each.
</P>
<P>
   Like Canion, who made an unsuccessful attempt to acquire Silicon
Graphics in the late 1980s, Pfeiffer looked to the high end of the
market to differentiate Compaq. The Tandem and Digital acquisitions
were meant to transform Compaq from the world's largest PC company
into a fully integrated computer systems company. Just as it had
passed IBM in personal-computer sales, so Compaq would come to lead
the systems business, Pfeiffer predicted.
</P>
<P>
   ``The kind of goals he had sounded good to shareholders _ like
being a $50 billion company by the year 2000, or to beat IBM _ but
they didn't have anything to do with customers,'' said Mark
Anderson, president of Strategic News Service, a research firm
based in Friday Harbor, Wash. ``The new CEO should look at
everything Eckhard acquired and ask: Did the customer benefit from
that? If the answer isn't yes, they should get rid of it.''
</P>
<P>
   Anderson said he was not necessarily advocating the sale of
Digital, Tandem or any of the smaller companies Compaq acquired in
recent years, only their integration into a coherent strategy. ``If
you think of the Internet as the all-embracing future, as Ben Rosen
seems to suggest from his statements, it's not hard to see how the
parts of Compaq fit into that,'' he said. ``The new CEO should have
a clear focus on a single business plan.''
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps the biggest challenge facing Compaq's next leader is how
to differentiate the company's products at a time when the value of
brands has been diminished and personal computers sell almost
exclusively on the basis of price. While Apple Computer can command
a small premium based on the ease of use or on the attractive
design of its products, and Sun Microsystems flourishes as a
high-end technology company identified with the Internet, most
computer makers struggle to add value to a commodity product.
</P>
<P>
   ``The business has been assiduously destroying pricing and
profitability, bent on self-immolation,'' said Seymour Merrin,
president of Merrin Information Services, a consulting firm based
in Palo Alto. ``Compaq, more than any other vendor, has the
opportunity to do what Robert Crandall at American Airlines did
when he said, `The time has come to stop killing ourselves.' The
customer, if he perceives value, is willing to pay. What all the
companies have failed to do, with Compaq right at the front, is to
differentiate.''
</P>
<P>
   Dell prospers by offering performance at a price, rather than
just a low price, and by making the purchasing process more
pleasant, Merrin said. But he said he did not believe that Compaq
should emulate Dell by eliminating the dealer channel.
</P>
<P>
   ``Compaq can't do that,'' Merrin said. ``They have better
distribution than anyone else. A good percentage of their customers
are buying through dealers because they want to. What they should
do is set up a totally separate business unit'' for direct sales.
</P>
<P>
   Tim Bajarin, president of Creative Strategies, a consulting firm
in Cupertino, Calif., agreed. ``I don't think you can cut the
channel off, but what you have to do is take off the price
protection you give dealers,'' he said, referring to the common
practice of reimbursing dealers for price cuts affecting current
inventory. ``It's a new world and a new economy.''
</P>
<P>
   The new chief executive Bajarin said, ``has to build a model
that says no matter what the customer wants to buy, no matter where
they want to buy it _ on the Internet, by telephone, in a
superstore _ Compaq has to make it available.''
</P>
<P>
   On a day of widespread losses among technology stocks, Compaq's
shares closed Monday at $22.75, down 87.5 cents, on trading of more
than 38 million shares.

E-COMMERCE REPORT: INTERNET ESCROW SERVICES ARE CATCHING ON
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Repeating as part of a weekly roundup of computer features)   By BOB TEDESCHI   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Internet auctions are promoted for their ability to rid the
world of middlemen and let buyers and sellers strike deals in
free-market harmony. But as auction sites look to cash in on the
trend by selling more costly goods, this Internet utopia is coming
under threat. Higher prices can mean lower levels of trust.
</P>
<P>
   That is why, in recent months, Internet escrow services have
gained a following in person-to-person selling circles. These
services, in which a third party holds the money until both buyer
and seller are satisfied with the transaction, can reduce the risk
of fraud, bounced checks or goods that fall short of expectations.
</P>
<P>
   Internet executives and analysts say a vast majority of business
is still conducted without such services, but that could change
quickly, as Beanie Babies and baseball cards are eclipsed on the
auction block by Bordeaux and BMWs.
</P>
<P>
   The services work as their offline counterparts do: The parties
strike an agreement, the buyer pays the sale price _ plus a fee,
which is typically 5 percent _ to the escrow service, and when the
buyer accepts the item, the escrow service transfers the money to
the seller. Though some online auction companies, such as Auction
Universe and Edeal, provide their own escrow services for
customers, others, like Amazon.com, Ebay and Yahoo Auctions, offer
the services of third-party escrow providers, often in exchange for
a percentage of the escrow fee.
</P>
<P>
   Notably, the escrow services collect the fee even when a
transaction falls through, as was the case with Heather Krolak, a
24-year-old photographer and artist from Brooklyn, who entered into
an agreement to buy a Patrick Nagel painting on Ebay in early
February for $1,500. ``I was skeptical,'' Ms. Krolak said, noting
that works by Nagel, a nationally known artist in the 1970s and
'80s, typically command much higher prices. ``It seemed like a
little too good of a deal.''
</P>
<P>
   Because the seller was in Spring Valley, Calif., Ms. Krolak
asked him to conduct the transaction through I-Escrow, one of the
two leading online escrow providers. (Tradesafe, I-Escrow's chief
competitor, is also available on Ebay. Both sites are also
available on Amazon's auction channel.) Ms. Krolak and the seller
clicked onto I-Escrow's site and registered, creating a secure page
in which they could further negotiate the length of the inspection
period and other terms of the deal.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Krolak argued for a one-week inspection period, while the
seller wanted to allow only one day. The seller also informed Ms.
Krolak that the artist's signature was slightly off, but that he
had a letter from the artist's brother verifying the painting's
authenticity. ``I thought that was a little odd,'' Ms. Krolak said,
``so I stuck to the one-week inspection period.''
</P>
<P>
   Upon receiving the painting, Ms. Krolak had it inspected by two
experts, who declared that it was not a Nagel. She sent it back,
forfeiting the $120 escrow fee. ``I was disappointed, and I lost
the fee,'' she said. ``But it was worth it because I would have
lost a lot more if I hadn't used it.''
</P>
<P>
   Would she bid on expensive artwork again? ``You have to be
careful _ especially with art,'' she said. ``But sure I would.''
</P>
<P>
   This is just the kind of testimonial that Internet auction sites
are hoping for, since Web auctioneers are intent on pushing the
average sale price for an item beyond the current $45 level so they
can collect fatter commissions.
</P>
<P>
   That means that consumers can expect to see more so-called
special event auctions, like a recent Ansel Adams auction on
Auction Universe, and more specialized auction sites where rare
items are offered. (Auction Universe is a division of Classified
Ventures.com, which is partly owned by The New York Times Co.)
</P>
<P>
   ``With more auction sites that are specific to collectors, we
could see an enormous growth in the need for escrow services,''
said Sue Rothberg, a senior analyst with Gomez Advisers, an
electronic commerce research firm in Concord, Mass. ``When you're
talking about things like antique Shaker furniture, those people
are serious shoppers who don't want to mess around.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Rothberg said that in a recent survey, she found that just
four of the top 15 Internet auction sites offered some form of
escrow service. ``But that will blossom, I'm certain,'' she said.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   According to Ken Pereira, Tradesafe's chief executive, less than
1 percent of auction transactions use escrow, although he expects
such use to exceed 4 percent by year's end. In the future, Pereira
said, ``we don't see it going much beyond 10 percent,'' because he
expects that most auctioned goods will still have relatively low
prices.
</P>
<P>
   But operators of escrow services see ample opportunity to
profit. Edeal, a Toronto-based auctioneer that offers customers an
escrow option, is one such example. ``If we start doing large
volumes of deals, there's constant cash in trust for us. It's not
our money, obviously, but you could have a period of a week where
there's $10 million in trust. We could invest it in an extremely
secure Treasury bill, for example, and roll it over at, say, 5
percent.''
</P>
<P>
   The company is ``still figuring out the legalities of it,'' said
Leon Kuperman, chief technology officer for Edeal. ``But we know
there's some potential there.''
</P>
<P>
   But some other auction sites avoid this approach. ``We're
licensed in California, so we have to put the money in a
non-interest-bearing trust,'' said Sanjay Bajaj, vice president for
marketing and business development at I-Escrow. ``But we make our
money on fees. We don't want any incentive to delay payment to
sellers.''
</P>
<P>
   Bajaj said the number of registered I-Escrow users had grown to
50,000 from 5,000 in the last five months, but ``you'd be surprised
at how many people still don't know about these services.''
</P>
<P>
   One reason, perhaps, is that escrow services generally do not
receive prominent placement on auction sites. On Ebay, for
instance, information about the service's escrow providers is
located two pages within sections titled Safe Harbor and After the
Auction.
</P>
<P>
   Escrow information may gain prominence as the value of auctioned
goods rises, though _ and in response to mounting concerns about
auction-related fraud.
</P>
<P>
   Noting that the National Consumers League had seen a 600 percent
increase in online fraud reports since 1997, Zona Research warned
in a recent report that ``if the online auction community does not
take steps to limit fraud then it could face serious problems,
including government intervention.''
</P>
<P>
   Given a choice between government intervention and a free-market
solution, auction providers may quickly see the virtue of promoting
escrow services front and center on the user's screen _
representing one small victory for Internet middlemen.

 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   David Mann has played piano and written arrangements for Frank
Sinatra, serenaded President Truman on his yacht and written
popular music like the song ``In the Wee Small Hours of the
Morning.''
</P>
<P>
   More recently, from his home in Kinnelon, N.J., he sits at a
different keyboard, talking about classical music with the members
of a chat room on America Online. By his estimate, he puts in at
least five hours a week as a volunteer, moderating a weekly chat
session, answering e-mail and filling out an online report about
his duties.
</P>
<P>
   In exchange, he and more than 10,000 other people who perform
similar tasks for the online service get a free account and the
designation ``community leader.'' What they do not get is a
paycheck, which is fine with Mann.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am not too concerned with being remunerated, since my
purpose was to fulfill an obligation to my art _ my Muse, as it
were. I merely believe that I owe it to the cause of good music to
steer less knowledgeable people in the right direction,'' said
Mann, 82, in an e-mail interview. ``I deem it not only an
obligation for me to do so, but a privilege.''
</P>
<P>
   While Mann considers his role a privilege, some former
volunteers for America Online view it as work and have filed
complaints with the Labor Department. They say volunteers at the
company are treated like employees and perform functions that are
integral to the online service's mission and should be paid.
</P>
<P>
   In asking the Labor Department to investigate their claims, they
have raised two decidedly Internet-age questions: When does taking
part in and enjoying a community transcend hobby status and become
work? And what does an Internet company owe to the people who give
it life, not to mention high valuations on the stock market?
</P>
<P>
   While the Labor Department will not comment on the complaints
against America Online or any action it is taking, the industry and
the volunteers themselves are looking on with interest. If the
department does find America Online in violation of laws like the
Federal Fair Labor Standards Act, it could change the online
landscape, since America Online is not the only company that relies
on the passions and goodwill of people like Mann.
</P>
<P>
   Dozens of other Internet businesses, including Prodigy
Communications, iVillage and Geocities, are built on the foundation
of a virtual community, where volunteer participants establish,
lead and police discussion areas. In turn, the businesses proudly
boast about the number of members who take part in their
communities, and trade on those numbers to attract advertisers and
make multimillion-dollar business deals. Without their
contributions, company executives acknowledge that their services
would be virtual ghost towns.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're the core foundation of our business,'' said Bruce
Zanca, a spokesman for Geocities, a Web community where he says 4
million people have built free home pages. Zanca said 1,800
volunteers contributed their time to the management of the online
community, hosting chat rooms and enforcing community standards,
among other tasks. In exchange, they get Geo-Points they can use to
buy products and services on Geocities.
</P>
<P>
   ``The monetary exchange probably wouldn't be an inducement,''
Zanca said. ``These people are the cyber equivalent of scout
leaders and PTA members and the Rotary and Kiwanis Clubs. Why do
people participate in these programs? It's the same reason I coach
Little League on Saturday mornings. It's something people do for
their own personal reasons.''
</P>
<P>
   The local Little League is a different proposition, however,
than Geocities, a publicly traded company with 300 paid employees
that was bought in January by Yahoo in a stock deal worth about
$3.6 billion.
</P>
<P>
   The notion of volunteering for a for-profit corporation is an
unusual one, so there is little precedent by which to judge these
relationships.
</P>
<P>
   But one question the Labor Department might be asking as it
looks into the complaints about America Online is whether the
volunteer force is providing a service that the company would have
to pay for if volunteers did not exist, said Jeffrey Chamberlain,
an employment lawyer based in Albany, N.Y..
</P>
<P>
   ``It's the difference between volunteering at IBM to assemble
computers and volunteering at the IBM soup kitchen,'' Chamberlain
said. ``The difference between doing good and making computers is
relatively conceptually easy to understand.''
</P>
<P>
   In the digital age, the lines between volunteering and working
without pay are less clear. Many of the people who volunteer online
say they do the work for personal reasons _ not for the
corporation.
</P>
<P>
   Terri Bass spends, by her estimation, 20 to 30 hours a week in
her home in Middleton, Wis., as a supervisor in the pet care forum
on America Online.
</P>
<P>
   She says she loves her virtual, unpaid job: hosting chat
sessions, checking bulletin boards for inappropriate comments,
responding to e-mail from those who visit the area. Sure, she said,
she would like to be paid. ``Who wouldn't love that?'' she said.
But even without financial compensation, she derives great
satisfaction from her work.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are a close-knit family here,'' she said. ``Most of my best
friends are here.''
</P>
<P>
   It may seem peculiar to the uninitiated that so many people
would give so much time, without financial compensation, to a
company with $2.6 billion in revenue last year and a stock market
valuation of $130 billion. Perhaps even more peculiar is the notion
that volunteers would be so personally invested in the work they
do. But it is a phenomenon that is part of an online tradition.
</P>
<P>
   ``Like sex, it looks funny from the outside,'' said Howard
Rheingold, author of the book ``The Virtual Community''
(Addison-Wesley, 1993). ``Any virtual community that works, works
because people put in some time.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   But in exchange, he said, what the members of virtual
communities need and want is respect. Many Internet businesses, in
the frenzied rush to capitalize on industry buzzwords, have used
the word ``community'' in their marketing, but not necessarily in
deed.
</P>
<P>
   Rheingold said he suspected this was the case with the
management at America Online.
</P>
<P>
   Scott Kurnit, founder of Mining Company, a guide to the
Internet, chose a different strategy to compensate the people who
manage various topics within the company's directory, like
``pregnancy'' or ``Southern food.'' Kurnit said he knew when he
started the company that he would need a large group of guides to
fulfill his promise of a ``human-powered'' search engine, but that
the economics of hiring a large staff were unrealistic for a
start-up operation. Instead, he pays the guides a combination of a
monthly stipend and a cut of the net revenues generated by
advertising on their sections. Kurnit says the guides, who now
number 692, earn between $500 and $11,000 a month, depending on the
popularity of the section.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, he said, he issued 200,000 shares of stock to the
guides, which is now worth a total of about $10 million. (The
company went public last month, making Kurnit, on paper, worth more
than $50 million.)
</P>
<P>
   In exchange, the guides sign over the rights to the sites they
create, and agree not to work for other online services in a
similar capacity.
</P>
<P>
   While for guides who have less trafficked sites, the
compensation might not equal a living wage, Kurnit feels his
program offers a fair reward, and that the company benefits more
than it would if he relied on volunteers.
</P>
<P>
   ``My view is entrepreneurs are the best workers _ they work
tirelessly,'' Kurnit said. ``Volunteers are unreliable, and have an
expectation that you owe them something.''
</P>
<P>
   However, Zanca of Geocities disagrees that the quality of work
he gets from his volunteers is less than if he were to pay them. He
also said he was not concerned that the Labor Department inquiry
might affect the way his company is structured.
</P>
<P>
   ``We think the Net has a new dynamic,'' he said, ``and in new
dynamics, laws and regulations need to be re-evaluated.''

 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   CAMBRIDGE, Mass. _ Each time a revolutionary new technology has
arrived, the governments of the day have been leery of its capacity
for mischief and criminality. Centuries ago, there were calls for
giving the authorities the power of prior restraint lest the
printing press become an instrument of sedition and slander. Later,
there were qualms about selling automobiles to the public because
crooks could use them to escape the police.
</P>
<P>
   As the designated representative of this rich and checkered
tradition, Philip Reitinger, a prosecutor for the Justice
Department, knew he faced a tough crowd here. He was speaking last
Wednesday at a conference to mark the 35th anniversary of the
founding of the Laboratory for Computer Science at the
Massachusetts Institute of Technology, a gathering of technology's
true believers.
</P>
<P>
   Reitinger, square-jawed and pin-striped, opened with a bit of
dry humor, laced with sarcasm. ``It may come as a shock to many of
you, but people commit crimes on the Internet,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   So began a spirited discussion and debate on a seemingly narrow
subject, ``Should the Laboratory for Computer Science Anonymous
Remailer Be Shut Down?'' But it was a discussion that focused on
some of the broadest social and legal issues involving the
Internet: identity, privacy, anonymity and free speech.
</P>
<P>
   Reitinger's opposite number on the panel was Nadine Strossen, a
professor at the New York Law School and president of the American
Civil Liberties Union. They were joined by Frans Kaashoek, an
associate professor at MIT, who has been in charge of the anonymous
remailer since it began operating in 1996.
</P>
<P>
   An anonymous remailer, a type of data-network relay, is
essentially a technological buffer. It can be used to mask the
origin of a piece of e-mail or the computer from which a person is
browsing the World Wide Web. It does this by stripping off the
identifying information on an e-mail, for example, and substituting
an anonymous code number or term. Sophisticated remailers, like the
one at MIT, also route messages through many different relay
computers around the world, leaving no record of the path an
anonymous message traveled after leaving the remailer.
</P>
<P>
   There are about 40 anonymous remail services worldwide. They are
used by, among others, dissidents and human rights representatives
living in nations with repressive governments, whistle-blowers
inside companies or government agencies, minority groups fearing
discrimination and people wishing to avoid the bulk e-mail
advertising pitches that marketers increasingly send over the Net.
In Kosovo, some people with online connections have started using
anonymous remail services to try to maintain confidential
communications and avoid detection by the Serbian military.
</P>
<P>
   But anonymous remail services, federal prosecutors say, are also
used by child pornographers, extortionists, software pirates and
drug dealers. Though not illegal, remailers are often viewed with
suspicion by law enforcement agencies. They occupy a gray area in
cyberspace, and Kaashoek of MIT good-naturedly underscored that
fact by wearing a black ski mask, showing only his eyes, for much
of the panel discussion.
</P>
<P>
   ``Anonymity has a down side to it,'' Reitinger said. ``It's hard
to put a pseudonym in jail. There are not a lot of indictments that
say, United States of America vs. John Doe. If people are truly
anonymous, there can be no law enforcement.''
</P>
<P>
   Reitinger and Ms. Strossen of the ACLU have debated these issues
in the past, so their early exchanges had the practiced rhythms of
old sparring partners. Her opening salvo: ``We've got to make sure
that freedom of speech, freedom of the press and privacy are as
protected in cyberspace as they are in the rest of life. Certain
individual rights cannot be sacrificed because of the panic and
fears of abuse of a new technology, or because it creates problems
for law enforcement.''
</P>
<P>
   Reitinger, a senior counsel in the Justice Department's computer
crime and intellectual property division, agreed that the Internet
had made his life more difficult. Trying to trace a path of
criminal communications often involves working with law enforcement
authorities in eight to 20 nations, he observed.
</P>
<P>
   Anonymous remailers can make that tracing far more difficult, if
not impossible. Kaashoek said MIT had received several subpoenas
from state and federal authorities since the university's remailer
was set up in 1996. MIT, he said, has answered the subpoenas but he
noted that typically the tracking information it can offer involves
only one leg of a many-legged path of communication. ``If a person
is using our system correctly,'' Kaashoek said, ``law enforcement
isn't going to find that information very useful.''
</P>
<P>
   As a communications medium, the Internet does seem unique in the
way that it magnifies the issues of privacy and anonymity. ``The
problem is that this technology is just so darned powerful,'' said
Paul Saffo, a director of the Institute for the Future. ``It makes
it easy to be anonymous, but it can also make it far easier to
track people down and invade their privacy.''
</P>
<P>
   Saffo did not attend the debate, but both Ms. Strossen and
Reitinger addressed the point that Internet technology has raised
the stakes on matters of privacy. Both agreed that the technology
poses difficult challenges, though they approached the subject from
understandably different vantage points.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Strossen said she was ``very concerned'' that new software
technology allows corporations or governments to track a person's
every mouse click and to assemble vast digital dossiers on
individuals. ``It can include all your personal financial
transactions and your medical records,'' she observed. ``I don't
think our laws adequately protect individual privacy anymore. The
technologies of anonymity and cryptography may be the only way to
protect privacy.''
</P>
<P>
   To which Reitinger responded: ``I think we are perilously close
to a lose-lose situation in which citizens have lost their privacy
to commercial interests and criminals have easy access to absolute
anonymity. That's not a world we want.''
</P>
<P>
   There was scattered clapping for various remarks made during the
debate, but that comment from Reitinger was greeted with sustained
applause. Sophisticated criminals, of course, will always have
access to the latest technology, whether cars or software. Nodding
to that reality, Reitinger told the audience of computer
scientists, ``I'm just asking that you help law enforcement to
capture the stupid criminals.''

   MCCARTY-COLUMN _ DAYTON, Ohio _ Martha Caprarotta loves to think
of the delicious mincemeat Jane Austen would make of Martha
Stewart: ``Jane Austen would have a marvelous time satirizing
Martha Stewart, with her perfect little parties _ and being more
interested in the veneer than in whether everyone is having a good
time.'' As a loyal ``Janeite,'' (as Austen aficionados are called)
and a very modern woman, these are the kinds of questions _ common

threads between the two very different skeins of 19th-and

   NETHAWAY-COLUMN _ DAINGERFIELD, Texas _ The driver of the

problem. He wanted me to move over. So did I. My motorcycle was
squirming wickedly in a muddy tire rut. If I tried to steer out of
the rut away from the oncoming semi, I felt sure that the bike
would fall, possible under the truck's wheels. During dinner the

   KELSO-COLUMN _ AUSTIN, Texas _ It beats me why folks get worked
up about the prospect of major-league baseball players wearing

you're not naked, there's a good chance that right this minute you
have on an article of clothing that plugs a running shoe,

different? (Kelso, Austin American-Statesman) MOVED.

NO TIME LIKE THE PRESENT TO BUY PC 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Repeating as part of a weekly roundup of computer features)   By DAVID HOYE   
 c.1999 The Arizona Republic   
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHOENIX - Think computers are too expensive? You haven't been
paying attention.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, eMachines (www.e4me.com) advertised a system with a
Cyrix M II-333, a 2.1-gigabyte hard drive, 32 megabytes of RAM, a
32-speed CD-ROM, Windows 98 and a 56kbps V.90 modem for $399. Want
to add a monitor? That'll be $499.
</P>
<P>
   Don't want to spend $400? How about a system for $299?
</P>
<P>
   Microworkz Computer (www.microworkz.com) is taking orders for
the WEBzter Jr., a $299 PC with a Cyrix M II-300, a 3.2-gigabyte
hard drive, 32 megabytes of RAM, Windows 98 and a 56kbps V.90
modem. Another $99 gets you a CD-ROM and floppy drive, and another
$140 gets you a 15-inch color monitor.
</P>
<P>
   Prices of computers at the other end of the scale are falling,
too.
</P>
<P>
   Six months ago, Dell advertised a $2,200 system with an Intel
Pentium II-450, a 10-gigabyte hard drive, 64 megabytes of RAM, a
32-speed CD-ROM drive, a 3D graphics card, a cutting-edge sound
card, a 17-inch monitor and a 56kbps V.90 modem. Today, you can get
basically the same system with a Pentium III-450 for $1,600.
</P>
<P>
   Yikes. Remember the days when you had to spend at least $1,500
to get a basic computer? And when really good computers cost more
than $3,000? That's all ancient history.
</P>
<P>
   Experts say it's due to increased competition between the three
big chipmakers _ Intel, AMD and Cyrix _ and traditional
computermakers _ Compaq, Dell, Hewlett-Packard _ and upstart
computermakers _ eMachines and Microworkz.
</P>
<P>
   Just last week, Compaq stock took a tumble after the company
said its earnings for the first quarter would fall below analyst
expectations. Among other things, Compaq blamed lower-than-expected
demand and increased competition in the commercial PC market.
</P>
<P>
   Falling PC prices also are due to the changing face of the
average computer buyer.
</P>
<P>
   There still are computer enthusiasts who will gladly fork over
$3,000 for the latest and greatest machine. But many of today's
buyers looking for their first machines don't want to spend even
$1,000. Others own expensive machines and just want a cheap second
computer for home use.
</P>
<P>
   Some of the new breed of computer buyers can't afford any more
than $1,000. International Data Corp., for example, has reported
that 56 percent of all sub-$1,000 PCs are sold into households with
annual incomes of $35,000 or less.
</P>
<P>
   Other buyers have just figured out that they don't need to spend
$3,000 or $2,000 or even $1,000 when all they want to do is surf
the Web, trade e-mail, balance the family checkbook and write
letters to Grandma.
</P>
<P>
   In recent months, the number of consumers seeking low-cost
computers has outpaced the number looking for top-end machines. A
recent ``San Jose Mercury News'' story, for example, stated that 61
percent of all PCs sold in retail stores cost $1,000 or less.
That's up dramatically from just 25 percent in 1997.
</P>
<P>
   Some market analysts predict that the penetration rate of PCs in
homes could soon exceed 100 percent, because so many people will
seek multiple computers to run everything from lights and security
systems to entertainment centers and kitchen appliances.
</P>
<P>
   Will computer prices continue to drop? Many experts think so.
The power of the Web and the versatility of electronic commerce is
giving small companies a chance to compete, and major corporations
will have to cut prices to maintain market share.
</P>
<P>
   It will be interesting to see how Apple Computer factors in to
all this. The company's iMac has proven hugely successful. Older
iMacs sell in the $900 range, but even new ones cost just $1,200.
And the Power Macintosh G3s _ Apple's top-of-the-line machines _
are getting rave reviews in the computer press.
</P>
<P>
   Any way you look at it, now's the time to buy. So get out there
and look around! But consider these thoughts before buying a
low-end PC:
</P>
<P>
   - As illustrated above, many of the cheapest systems are not as
complete as we might like them to be. Some come with all the
hardware you might need, but no operating system. Some don't come
with monitors or CD-ROM drives. Read the fine print and make sure
you know what you are buying.
</P>
<P>
   - Nobody is giving anything away. Makers of cheap PCs are
cutting corners. That's not to say cheap PCs are unreliable. But
don't expect the same performance as you would from a name-brand,
top-notch machine.
</P>
<P>
   - Think about how you will use the computer before you buy one.
Cheap PCs are great for Web surfing, sending e-mail and simple
computing. But if you like to play the latest 3D games, a cheap PC
probably will give you poor performance or none at all. &QL; 
SPIRITS ARE ABOUT TO SPEAK &QL; 
As you might expect, last week's column about the mystery at Harold
Temmer's Sun City West home sparked quite a few e-mails from
readers.
</P>
<P>
   In case you missed it, here's the nutshell version: Temmer's
wife wrote a letter to friends on the computer. Temmer later called
the letter up on the computer and found the name and address of a
stranger typed at the bottom. Turns out the stranger had been dead
10 years, and nobody could figure out how his name and address got
into Temmer's computer.
</P>
<P>
   Without any other explanation, Temmer and I joked that his
computer must be haunted!
</P>
<P>
   As I pointed out in the column, we ruled out the possibility
that Temmer bought a computer with a used hard drive that could
have contained the stranger's information. Temmer said he bought
the computer six years ago, and the stranger died four years before
that. And the stranger's information had never shown up on Temmer's
computer before.
</P>
<P>
   A reader named Richard wrote: ``To me, there was a delicious
irony in the coincidence that your article was headlined ``Do the
dead have PCs in heaven?'' _ appearing just below the Cyberslang
definition of ``Legacy Tech'' as ``outdated hardware and
software.'' Surely, if the dead have PCs in heaven, what they've
got is Legacy Tech: dead, gone and obsolete computers.
</P>
<P>
   A reader named Sharron had several ideas. Among them, ``Because
he is a retired assistant vice chancellor of the University of
California-San Diego, he could have an intelligent friend playing a
trick on him.''
</P>
<P>
   A reader named Virginia wrote, ``Since it was a man's name and
address, perhaps this bit of data came from a mailing list _ one
that hasn't been updated in a while or that is using very old data.
If Temmer and his wife haven't used any mailing lists and don't
have any on their computer, perhaps they have received something
from someone else's mailing list. An e-mail about a class reunion,
perhaps, or a church group, or fund-raising spam.''
</P>
<P>
   Finally, a reader named Tom wrote, ``In regard to your headline
in today's ``Republic,'' `Do the dead have PCs in heaven?' I have
the answer: No. In heaven, they have Macs. The PCs go to the other
place.'' &QL;

COMDEX FEATURES OPERATING SYSTEM WARS
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Repeating as part of a weekly roundup of computer features)  By ANDREW J. GLASS  
c.1999 Cox News Service  
<TEXT>
<P>
   CHICAGO -- When it comes to our corporate customers, we say,
`Hey, whatever floats your boat.' ''
</P>
<P>
   So says Richard Sullivan, an IBM software marketing executive.
His is a widely held view at the spring Comdex computer conference
in Chicago, where much of the talk Tuesday was of rivalries,
alliances and marketing deals.
</P>
<P>
   Nowhere is the multi-flavored approach more evident than with
operating systems, the underlying software that powers such
applications as word processors and Internet connections.
</P>
<P>
   While Windows, the operating system sold by giant Microsoft,
dominates personal computer desktops, the overall market remains
more fluid. Computer professionals who deal with such hardware as
network
</P>
<P>
   servers and hand-held devices have come to recognize that they
have plenty of choices in operating systems.
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft takes up the single largest chunk of floor space at
the huge Comdex trade show for its Windows 2000 system. But the
densest crowds have flocked to a cluster of booths that feature
Linux, an
</P>
<P>
   operating system that some industry watchers have hailed as a
serious competitor to Windows -- and not only because it can be
downloaded for free on the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you're in the operating system game, you're competing with
Microsoft,'' said Robert Young, the chairman and chief executive
officer of Red Hat Software, which offers Linux at no cost on its
Web site and for $50 on a CD. ``If you compete with a monopolist,''
he said, ``you can't play by their (CQ) rules.''
</P>
<P>
   The number of Linux users has risen from 100,000 in 1993 to more
than 15 million today, and Young estimates Linux holds 17 per cent
of the operating system market.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike Windows, Linux can run on machines powered by other
</P>
<P>
   than Intel processors, including Alpha and Sun Sparcmachines
processors.
</P>
<P>
   The increase in Linux users prompted Dell Computer earlier this
month to offer Linux installations on its network servers and on
its popular Optiplex workstations.
</P>
<P>
   Also, several large computer and software firms _ including IBM,
Compaq Computer, Novell and Oracle _ have invested in Durham,
N.C.-based Red Hat Software, which makes its money by packaging
Linux software and services.
</P>
<P>
   But Linux isn't the only competition for Windows.
</P>
<P>
   ``Despite Linux's momentum, sales of rival operating systems
continue to chug along at a healthy rate,'' said Joseph Panettieri,
executive editor of
</P>
<P>
   Smart Reseller, a trade publication. ``Simply put,'' he added,
``savvy resellers and network administrators know that they can't
bet their
</P>
<P>
   businesses on a single operating system. Instead, astute
technology managers are keeping one eye on established operating
systems while keeping the other on the fledgling Linux industry.''
</P>
<P>
   IBM, which has five times the revenue of Microsoft, illustrates
this trend. The company has named separate full-time system
managers to work in
</P>
<P>
   with Microsoft and with the Linux community.
</P>
<P>
   Said Linus Torvalds, who created Linux eight years ago and who
has emerged as a big celebrity at Comdex: ``I want to see when
people go into a computer store, that they have to think about what
operating system to use, that there isn't one default choice.''

<P>
   MIAMI _ There's a hurricane brewing in the Caribbean, but it has
nothing to do with wind or rain.
</P>
<P>
   Caribbean leaders are outraged by a British government proposal
to restore full citizenship to its 13 remaining colonies, from the
Pacific to the Caribbean -- at a price.
</P>
<P>
   Britain has ordered the island commonwealths to ditch the death
penalty and bans on homosexuality, and to tighten regulation of
offshore banking, the lifeblood of islands such as Bermuda.
</P>
<P>
   The colonies are to bring their laws into line with British
practice by the end of the year.
</P>
<P>
   And if the colonies' local governments do not comply, Britain
will change their laws for them.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are committed to seeing it done,'' said British Foreign
Secretary Robin Cook.
</P>
<P>
   Cook unveiled the proposal before the British Parliament on
March 17 after months of wrangling over the citizenship issue. The
Parliament is expected to vote on the plan within weeks.
</P>
<P>
   Cook said the move would end the ``strong sense of grievance''
felt in the territories since their citizenship rights were taken
away by the Thatcher government in 1981.
</P>
<P>
   But in the Caribbean, a region that's historically religious and
conservative, the demand to legalize homosexual acts, in
particular, has incited controversy.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier this month, the community affairs minister in the Cayman
Islands, Julianna O'Connor-Connolly, said the Cayman Islands had a
``mandate from God'' to retain its ban on gay sex.
</P>
<P>
   ``We abide by the views of the vast majority of Caymanians who
live in a Christian community based on firmly held religious
beliefs that homosexuality should not be legalized,'' the
government said in a recent statement.
</P>
<P>
   The homosexuality question became a hot-button issue last year
when the Cayman Islands prohibited an American cruise ship carrying
some 900 gay men from making a one-day stop there.
</P>
<P>
   Later anti-gay activists in Jamaica protested against a
scheduled performance by the Village People, a six-member band that
became gay icons in the late 1970s, causing the group to cancel
their concert.
</P>
<P>
   All this prompted U.S. gay and lesbian groups to boycott some
islands -- including the Caymans and Jamaica -- citing blatant and
widespread discrimination.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've continued to put pressure on these islands because we've
received reports of gay travelers feeling harassed in certain
places,'' said Augustin Merlo, executive director of the
International Gay &AMP; Lesbian Travel Association in Fort Lauderdale,
Fla.
</P>
<P>
   Islands have often found themselves torn between their
conservative cultures and a desire to attract tourism dollars from
gays and lesbians who represent a $47.3 billion travel market.
</P>
<P>
   Cornelius Smith, tourism minister in the Bahamas, said most
Caribbean islands welcome gay tourists, although anti-homosexual
sentiments shouldn't come as a surprise in a region where churches
are often more pervasive than bars.
</P>
<P>
   In the Bahamas, which is not a British colony but where
homosexuality is also illegal, one pastor has helped organize a
Christian group called Save the Bahamas that plans to lobby for
stricter sodomy laws as well as a ban on gay cruises.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is often said that when the United States sneezes, the
Caribbean catches the flu, so when morals decline in the United
States, they decline here,'' said Vaughn Miller, pastor of Nassau's
Resurrection Tabernacle Church.
</P>
<P>
   ``Obviously we don't want that to happen,'' he added.
</P>
<P>
   David Smith, senior strategist with the Human Rights Campaign, a
Washington-based gay and lesbian lobbying group, said he is stunned
by discrimination in the Caribbean and that ``recalcitrant
protectorates'' were acting outside the mainstream.
</P>
<P>
   ``Such discrimination against an entire group of people is
egregious,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, the conservative American Family Association has
applauded the resolve of Caribbean islands that won't bend to
British demands.
</P>
<P>
   It is urging its 350,000 supporters in the May issue of the
association's magazine to contact the British Embassy in Washington
to voice dissatisfaction with the government's proposal.
</P>
<P>
   The Tupelo, Miss.-based organization was the first to promote a
Disney boycott after Disney-owned studios produced such sexually
controversial movies as ``Priest'' and ``Pulp Fiction.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Britain can do what it wants, but we don't have to agree with
it, so what we're doing is encouraging travelers to spend their
tourism dollars in places other than England,'' said Allen Wildmon,
director of public relations for the American Family Association.
</P>
<P>
   Britain's controversial plan would restore full citizenship
rights revoked in 1981 for colonies as far-flung as Anguilla in the
Caribbean to St. Helena halfway between Africa and South America to
the Pitcairn Islands in the Pacific.
</P>
<P>
   Back then, fearing vast migration among Hong Kong's 6.4 million
people ahead of the island's handover to China, Britain made people
in the colonies ``British subjects,'' stripping them of the
automatic right to live and work in Britain.
</P>
<P>
   The change will give colonial residents ``the right to travel
freely throughout the European Union, and will enable their young
people to support themselves through work experience while they
study in Britain,'' Cook said.
</P>
<P>
   The proposal is particularly welcome in Montserrat, where most
of the island's 12,000 residents were evacuated due to an active
volcano.
</P>
<P>
   But in the British Virgin Islands, Chief Minister Ralph O'Neal
said London's demands smack of ``a form of imperialism.''
</P>
<P>
   He said he has no plans to scrap the death penalty. Rather he
wants to extend it to include drug traffickers.
</P>
<P>
   Bermuda -- the oldest and wealthiest of the colonies -- has been
the most vocal in its opposition to the proposal, with some
residents suggesting independence.
</P>
<P>
   The island of 61,000 people has denounced what it sees as
Britain's attempt to threaten its tax haven status.
</P>
<P>
   Bermuda has grown rich by encouraging offshore banking, an
industry that's been criticized for both its secretive rules and
for laundering illicit drug profits.
</P>
<P>
   ``We need a referendum to decide whether or not the country
wants to be tied to the United Kingdom,'' said former Premier
Pamela Gordon. ``If not, then the only choice would be
independence.''

 &HT;    Some parents ase less likely to hear ``YUCK, what's this?''
 &HT;    By Christi Mays
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Sevvice
<TEXT>
<P>
   WACO, Texas _ Jacob Koehler, 2 1/2, will eat just about any
fruit or vegetable his dad puts in front of him.
</P>
<P>
   It's a good thing, too, considering his dad( David Koehler, is a
produce manager.
</P>
<P>
   ``Eating fruits and vegetables is very important, especially in
the early years for growing and building bones and muscles,''
Koehler said. ``They're good for getting the vitamin A's and C's
you need for a good start in life.''
</P>
<P>
   Getting children accustomed to eating a variety of fruits and
veggies early on in life is a key to setting them on the right
track to good, lifelong eating habits, nutrition experts say.
</P>
<P>
   The vitamins and minerals found in many fruits and vegetables,
especially vitamins C, A and B, calcium, fiber, iron and
carbohydrates, are essential for growth and development.
</P>
<P>
   Strawberries, kiwi, all citrus fruits and broccoli are all great
sources of vitamin C, an antioxidant thought to have protect
against certain chronic diseases, such as cancer, according to Lisa
Hoelscher, a registered dietitian who consults individuals on their
diets at her business Excellence in Health.
</P>
<P>
   Broccoli also contains fiber and rome calcium.
</P>
<P>
   Corn and potatoes contain some B vitamins, including niacin in
corn, and both are good complex carbohydrate choices and have
fiber.
</P>
<P>
   Carrots and other orange or yellow vegetables are sources for
vitamin A, another antioxidant.
</P>
<P>
   Some fruits and vegetables, including broccoli, cabbage,
cauliflower, Brussels sprouts, kohlrabi, garlic, onion, leeks,
chives, oranges and grapefruit, also contain phytochemicals,
substances that have been shown to provide protective effects
against chronic diseases such as cancer and heart disease,
Hoelscher said.
</P>
<P>
   According to the Food Guide Pyramid, children and adults should
eat five to nine servings of fruits and vegetables each day.
</P>
<P>
   Lelanie Presley, a dietitian and food service supervisor with
the Wcco Independent School District, says many children aren't
eating the number of servings of fruits and vegetables they should.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think part of it has to do with parent's knowledge of what
good nutrition is,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Today's always-on-the-go society doesn't help much, either,
proving a challenge even for health-savvy parents to ensure their
children eat the recommended servings of fruits and vegetables.
</P>
<P>
   ``Adults are in such a fast-food age now, more than they used to
be . . . that I think it makes it harder and harder for children to
learn about vegetables,'' Hoelscher said.
</P>
<P>
   But just because people are eating quickly these days doesn't
mean they have to leave out vegetables or allow children to turn to
their food of choice _ junk food, Hoelscher said.
</P>
<P>
   Here are some ways parents can get children _ from picky eaters
to overeaters _ to add more fruits and vegetables to their diets:
</P>
<P>
   _ Keep an assortment of fruits and veggies easily accessible to
youngsters.
</P>
<P>
   ``If he sees them, he'll want to eat those first,'' Koehler said
of his son.
</P>
<P>
   _ Take kids shopping for fruits and vegetables.
</P>
<P>
   ``It seems to always help when you take them shopping with you
because when they pick out some of the fruits and vegetables. They
have ownership in it,'' Koehler said. It also familiarizes kids
with the different type of fruits and vegetables, so they aren't
foreign objects once cooked and on the plate.
</P>
<P>
   _ When kids are old enough, have them help out in the kitchen.
</P>
<P>
   ``If they help in preparation of it, they have ownership in it
and want to eat it once it's cooked,'' Koehler said.
</P>
<P>
   _ Get creative with food. Make fun faces out of the different
fruits or carve vegetables into fun shapes.
</P>
<P>
   A child will eat almost anything if you melt some Velveeta
cheese on it or dip it in ranch dressing, Koehler said.
</P>
<P>
   _ Serve bite-size veggies, like carrots and broccoli, at room
temperature.
</P>
<P>
   _ For the picky eater, look for seasonal fruits. A child might
not be fond of citrus fruits, but may like watermelon, peaches and
plums, which are readily available during the summer.
</P>
<P>
   _ Parents should set a good example by eating a variety of
fruits and vegetables on a regular basis, even if it's grabbing a
banana for the ride to work.
</P>
<P>
   _ Go the extra mile and plan at least a few sit-down dinners a
week.
</P>
<P>
   ``Kids who still sit down at the table and have meals together
(with the family) generally have better quality nutrition than kids
that do that less frequently, according to surveys,'' Hoelscher
said.
</P>
<P>
   _ Parents should never express dislike of a particular vegetable
in front of a child. Let children form their own opinions of food.
</P>
<P>
   _ The Children's Nutrition Research Center suggests hiding
fruits and vegetables in foods kids like. Finely chop carrots,
celery, broccoli, onion and zucchini in the food processor. Saute
to soften and add to pizza, spaghetti sauces, meatloaf, burgers,
refried beans, soups and favorite casseroles. Bake items such as
carrot cake, zucchini muffins and sweet potato pie and pumpkin
cheesecake. Use vegetable juice in food preparation instead of
water.Instead of using water when preparing soups, casseroles and
stews, use vegetable juice.
</P>
<P>
   _ Try to find a happy medium, Presley said. Don't cut off kids
from sugar and fats, just set limits.
</P>
<P>
   ``You don't want to restrict them too far with fat intake
because their bodies need it to grow,'' she said. Allow children to
eat an occasional sweet, but don't use them as rewards since that
can send the wrong message, Presley said.
</P>
<P>
   _ Keep tabs on a child's overall eating habits, keeping in mind
that a variety of foods from all food groups is important for
healthy growth.
</P>
<P>
   _ Don't give up.
</P>
<P>
   ``You just have to stay determined and be patient,'' Hoelscher
said. ``Keep trying and keep setting a good example and offering
the variety of fruits and vegetables and let them take your lead
and follow your example.''
</P>
<P>
   _ Use lots of color on the plate. Good color combinations are
key _ green and orange or yellow makes for a appealing meal.
</P>
<P>
   _ Don't load up a child's plate then force the child to eat it
all.
</P>
<P>
   ``Let them have very small portions,'' Hoelscher said. ``A
couple of bites is OK. We get used to adult-size portions. A very
small amount is more acceptable than none at all.''

 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service

<P>
   Have a question about the news? Colin Bessonette will try to get
an answer. Call 404-222-2002, or write him at The Atlanta
Journal-Constitution, P.O. Box 4689, Atlanta, Ga. 30302, or e-mail

<P>
   Q: I wanted to see Julie Andrews in ``Victor/Victoria'' in
Houston, but that performance was canceled because of her throat
surgery. Since then I've heard she will never sing again. What's
the story?
</P>
<P>
   A: Andrews underwent throat surgery in 1997 to remove
non-cancerous nodules in her throat. She says it was described to
her as a routine procedure. Now, two years later, she remains
unable to sing and is contemplating a lawsuit. ``It is in the hands
of lawyers and we will make some decisions,'' she told London's
Daily Telegraph in February. Her husband, director Blake Edwards,
said last year he didn't think she would ever sing again. ``If you
heard her voice, you would weep,'' he said. ``It's an absolute
tragedy.'' Andrews, who was said at the time to be angered by
Edwards' comments, remains hopeful that her condition can be
reversed. ``I have to be optimistic,'' she told the Telegraph. ``I
think to some degree I'm in a form of denial about it. If I could
not sing with an orchestra . . . I think I would be devastated. . .
. Right now I simply can't contemplate it. I don't want to say that
I never can.''
</P>
<P>
   Q: I bought my first Big Game lottery ticket recently. The odds
of winning the least amount ($1) by getting only the Big Money Ball
is given as 1:62. Since there are 36 numbers from which to choose
one number, shouldn't it be 1:36?
</P>
<P>
   A: When calculating the odds for the $1 prize in the Big Game,
the formula is determined by the odds of getting one gold ``Big
Money'' ball correct within a field of 36, multiplied by the odds
of getting the five white balls in a field of 50 incorrect. So the
odds indeed are 1:62.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Organic gardening often utilizes cow, sheep and/or other
animal manure as fertilizers. Does this make the risk of E. coli or
other viral or bacterial exposure a possibility on the vegetables
harvested from that soil?
</P>
<P>
   A: It's possible. Organic production does in fact increase some
risks, said Paul Guillebeau, entomologist with the University of
Georgia Extension Service. In many cases, ``organic'' means that
the foods were grown with animal manures instead of chemical
fertilizers. So the risks from pesticides may be reduced, but the
possibility of contamination with fungal toxins, such as aflatoxin,
may be increased, Guillebeau said, citing research by the U.S. Food
and Drug Administration. Animal manure is the primary reservoir for
a virulent strain of E. coli. In 1996, the Centers for Disease
Control and Prevention in Atlanta confirmed nearly 2,500 cases of
this virulent strain, along with 250 deaths. Although organic foods
made up only 1 percent of the U.S. food supply during that time,
organics were implicated in 8 percent of the confirmed cases.
</P>
<P>
   While Guillebeau said he was not condemning organic foods, he
added that organic producers may exacerbate the problems because
they typically don't use chlorinated water or other disinfectants
before their products are sold.
</P>
<P>
   Q: How are dogs trained to sniff out drugs?
</P>
<P>
   A: A dog's sense of smell is said to be 50,000 times greater
than a human's, which enables it to detect microscopic scent
particles. Trainers and handlers of ``dedicated drugs dogs,'' as
such sniffers are called, introduce them to the scent of a
particular controlled drug _ even small amounts of cocaine,
marijuana, heroin _ early in their training. The trainers and
handlers use play, praise and patience to encourage the dog's
natural foraging instincts. When the dog detects the drug's scent,
it alerts its handler, and usually is rewarded with praise or its
favorite toy.
</P>
<P>
   Commonly used sniffer breeds include Labrador retrievers,
English springer spaniels and German shepherds. Several companies,
including the Vonderhaus Gill German Shepherd Training School in
Wapakoneta, Ohio, and Kontraband Interdiction &AMP; Detection Services
of Modesto, Calif., train the dogs.
</P>
<P>
   Q: A federal judge has fined the American Airlines pilots' union
more than $45 million for refusing his back-to-work order during
the February ``sickout.'' Where does that money go?
</P>
<P>
   A: The Allied Pilots Union fine must be paid directly to AMR
Group, the parent of American Airlines.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Before the days of cordless and cell phones, people were
advised to avoid talking on their telephones during thunder and
lightning storms. Is there a similar danger if using cordless
equipment?
</P>
<P>
   A: Not if the person using the wireless phone is indoors and
protected, according to the Cellular Telecommunications Industry
Association in Washington. It's not recommended when outdoors,
however. A CTIA spokesman said you shouldn't have any piece of
metal touching or near your body when outdoors in a thunder or
lightning storm. A mobile phone contains pieces of metal, and if
you're talking on it, you're holding the metal-containing device
next to your head. That's not a good idea, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Q: What did Samuel R. Berger do before he became the national
security adviser for the United States?
</P>
<P>
   A: During President Clinton's first term in office, Sandy
Berger's title was deputy assistant to the president for national
security affairs. In that position, he served as chairman of the
Deputies Committee of the National Security Council, the
sub-Cabinet interagency group charged with coordination of foreign
policy. Before that, he was Clinton's senior foreign policy adviser
during the 1992 presidential campaign and assistant transition
director for national security of the 1992 Clinton-Al Gore
transition.
</P>
<P>
   Berger's prior experience in government includes having served
as special assistant to former New York Mayor John Lindsay;
legislative assistant for former Sen. Harold Hughes (D-Iowa) and
Rep. Joseph Resnick (D-N.Y.); and deputy director of the State
Department's policy planning staff.
</P>
<P>
   He also worked in the State Department during the administration
of President Jimmy Carter, and was a speechwriter in 1972 for
George McGovern's presidential campaign. Additionally, Berger
practiced law with the Washington law firm of Hogan &AMP; Hartson
(1973-77 and 1981-92). He received his BA degree from Cornell
University in 1967 and his J.D. degree from Harvard Law School in
1971.
</P>
<P>
   Q: I saw that detectives in Texas were searching in a field for
the body of renowned atheist Madalyn Murray O'Hair. Do you have any
information?
</P>
<P>
   A: On Easter weekend, federal authorities _ acting on
information from seven-time felon Gary P. Karr, suspected as an
accessory in the 1995 disappearance of O'Hair and her family _ dug
up portions of a 5,000-acre ranch west of San Antonio. As last
report they were refusing to say what, if anything, they found.
</P>
<P>
   The Austin Statesman-American reported that on March 24, Karr
had spent 13 hours voluntarily talking to investigators at his
apartment in Novi, Mich. While the newspaper said he didn't confess
to the killings of O'Hair; her son, Jon Garth Murray; and the
granddaughter she adopted as her own daughter, Robin Murray-O'Hair,
he did admit to concealing bodies, hiding victims' property,
acquiring vehicles and playing a key role in transferring $600,000
to a San Antonio gold dealer. The San Antonio Express-News,
meanwhile, has quoted FBI agent William O'Leary as testifying that
Karr has admitted an ``extensive role'' in the three deaths as well
as that of one other person, and has told the FBI the city where
the victoms' bodies were buried.
</P>
<P>
   Many questions in the case remain unanswered. David Roland
Waters, a former O'Hair employee convicted in 1995 of stealing
$54,000 from O'Hair's American Atheists organization, also is being
questioned. He is in jail in Austin after being arrested on weapons
charges and Karr, also arrested on weapons charges, is in jail in
Detroit. Waters' Austin attorney, Patrick Ganne, said he believes
authorities are ``waiting for one to break,'' but he insisted that
his client has nothing to tell authorities.
</P>
<P>
   Q: I've read a lot about NATO's military intervention in
Yugoslavia, but I haven't seen any explanation about its stated
motive or where it derives its authority. Can you elaborate?
</P>
<P>
   A: The stated motive is safeguarding international peace and
security, as permitted under the U.N. Charter. Just before NATO
began its bombardment campaign, A. Peter Burleigh, acting U.S.
ambassador to the United Nations, said the U.N. Security Council
gave NATO that authority in October when it called for a cease-fire
in Kosovo under the council's Chapter VII, or war-making,
authority.
</P>
<P>
   Russia and China have voiced strong opposition, saying NATO's
claim to be safeguarding international peace and security is
forbidden to regional alliances without specific authority from the
Security Council. But 13 of NATO's 19 members are participating in
the attacks on Yugoslav military forces, and three of the five
Security Council members with veto power over resolutions _ the
United States, Britain and France _ are participants in the NATO
bombing campaign. So Russia and China are making little headway.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Is Andrea Koppel of CNN related to Ted Koppel? It's not a
common name.
</P>
<P>
   A: She's Ted's daughter.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Equifax recently ran a full-page newspaper ad saying it has a
history of ``100 years in business changing the shape of global
commerce.'' I've seen its headquarters building in Atlanta, but I
have no idea what the company does. Can you explain?
</P>
<P>
   A: Its global operations involve the financial services, retail,
credit card, telecommunications/utilities, transportation,
information technology and healthcare industries, as well as
government. Hoover's Handbook of American Business says Equifax,
the nation's largest consumer credit reporter, approves check
purchases, processes credit card applications and transactions,
provides database marketing consulting services, and develops
credit-scoring software. Its customers run the gamut from banks and
other financial institutions to hotels and retailers.
</P>
<P>
   The company traces its roots to 1899, when brothers Cator and
Guy Woolford started Retail Credit Co. in Atlanta. They compiled
credit records of local residences into their Merchants Guide,
which they sold to retailers for $25 a year. The brothers extended
their services to the insurance industry in 1901, investigating the
backgrounds of insurance applicants. After several decades, Retail
Credit branched into other information sectors, and in 1976 changed
its name to Equifax (short for ``equitability in the gathering and
presentation of facts'').
</P>
<P>
   There are two other large personal credit reporting bureaus are
TransUnion and Experian, formerly known as TRW.

   Q: My Girl Scout troop wants to send mail to U.S. service
personnel involved in the Kosovo operation. What is the address?
</P>
<P>
   A: For Army, Navy, Air Force and Marine Corps land forces: Any
Service Member, Operation Joint Forge, APO AE 09397-000.
</P>
<P>
   For Navy and Marine Corps personnel aboard ships: Any Service

<P>
   Q: America's consumption of chicken _ fingers, wings, nuggets,
strips, breasts, thighs, legs _ is unbelievable. Just how many
chickens are raised in the United States to feed this insatiable
appetite?
</P>
<P>
   A: The numbers are astonishing, and growing steadily. Eight
billion chickens are raised in the United States each year, says
Richard Lobb of the National Chicken Council in Washington. About
83 percent of that total is for U.S. consumption, with the
remainder exported. Americans consume about 75 pounds of chicken
per person, per year, Lobb said, with the U.S. Department of
Agriculture predicting that number may rise to 78-79 pounds per
person in 1999.
</P>
<P>
   Q: My wife, three children and I were at Atlanta Stadium that
cool April night in 1974 when Henry Aaron broke Babe Ruth's career
home run record. I don't remember seeing the number of games it
took for each player. Did Hank do it in fewer or more games than
Ruth?
</P>
<P>
   A: It took Aaron 467 more games than Ruth to reach 714 home
runs. Ruth did it in 2,498 games; Aaron in 2,965, said Frank Vito
of the Baseball Hall of Fame in Cooperstown, N.Y. Aaron broke
Ruth's record by hitting his 715th home run on April 8, 1974. In
his career, Aaron played in 3,298 games over 23 years; Ruth played
in 2,503 games over 22 years.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Where can we write the judge in the Jack Kevorkian case to
express our opinion on his sentencing?
</P>
<P>
   A: Judge Jessica Cooper of the Oakland County (Mich.) Circuit
Court is not soliciting or encouraging comments, said a spokeswoman
in Cooper's chambers. ``This is a court of law, not a court of
public opinion,'' the spokeswoman added. Nevertheless, she said
letters can be addressed to: Judge Jessica Cooper, Oakland County
Courthouse, Pontiac, MI 48341.
</P>
<P>
   Q: How can contributions for Kosovo relief be made to the
organization that Billy Graham's son heads?
</P>
<P>
   A: You're referring to Franklin Graham's Samaritan's Purse,
which has worked in the Balkans since the region erupted in ethnic
conflict in 1991. During that time, it has provided more than $12
million in aid to Bosnia and other Balkan countries, the
organization says. Contributions can be sent to: Samaritan's Purse,
P.O. Box 3000, Boone, NC 28607. For more information, call its
Kosovo crisis hotline: 1-800-665-2843. Online information:

</P>
<P>
   Q: I recently saw a silly movie on TV called ``Biosphere.'' It
made me wonder: What happened to the biodome or biosphere that
several scientists lived in some years ago? It seems to have
dropped out of the news.
</P>
<P>
   A: The attempt to build an enclosed, self-sustaining
``mini-Earth'' ecosystem did indeed drop out of the news because,
in the end, the $150 million dream of Texas billionaire Edward P.
Bass was a flop. Four men and four women sealed themselves into
Biosphere II on Sept. 26, 1991, planning to live there without
leaving for two years. The airtight Biosphere II named after what
the researchers called Biosphere I, which is Earth _ covered 3
acres in Oracle, Ariz., with seven different climate zones in a
glass and steel greenhouse.
</P>
<P>
   The inhabitants intended to grow their own food and recycle
their waste, receiving nothing from the outside world except
sunlight and electricity. Their hope was to study the interlocking
dynamics of Earth's ecology, with the data they obtained perhaps
applicable to colonizing space or gauging the feasibility of
building similar refuges on Earth to preserve life in the event of
a catastrophe such as nuclear war. Critics were skeptical from the
start, calling it a ``scientific crapshoot'' and a ``Disneyland.''
</P>
<P>
   Problems weren't long in coming. On Dec. 9, 1991, operators of
Biosphere II acknowledged that outside air had been pumped into the
facilityto compensate for leakage. They denied that the move was
taken to deal with a rising carbon dioxide level, or that it
invalidated the experiment. And one member brought supplies back
from the outside after leaving the facility for surgery on a
wounded finger.
</P>
<P>
   The eight researchers emerged on Sept. 26, 1993. The team had
produced about 80 percent of its food, but suffered several crop
failures due to swarms of mites and other insects. In 1994, two
original crew members were accused of sabotaging the project, and
Bass, citing mismanagement of funds, fired several top officers and
ordered private police to seize the project. Q: Recent talk about
the downed Stealth fighter makes me wonder if our armed forces
considered trying to destroy the remains of the fallen aircraft,
once the pilot was rescued. Would such a thing be considered to
prevent sensitive technology from falling into the wrong hands?
</P>
<P>
   A: It's standard U.S. military procedure, when a plane of such
technological value crashes, either to recover the pieces or to
bomb them, for the very reason you suggest. Recovery attempts seem
to be more likely, with no information available to suggest past
use of the bombing option. Such was the case in 1997, when an F-117
crashed during an air show near Baltimore. Air Force officials
sealed off the residential crash site and scoured the area for even
tiny pieces of debris. Mechanical reasons were blamed for that
crash.
</P>
<P>
   In the March 27 incident in Yugoslavia, a large number of pieces
of the F-117 Nighthawk fighter-bomber remained intact, and Serbs
reportedly gave some of the pieces to the Russians, who reportedly
haven't yet developed their own stealth technology.
</P>
<P>
   Although Air Force and other analysts said the technologies
employed in creating the Nighthawk are outmoded, and what little
could be discerned from the pieces wouldn't be significant, other
analysts aren't so sure. They contend that enemy scientists could
glean enough clues from the debris to develop their own
radar-evading technology. In any case, the Pentagon has publicly
played down concerns about the matter.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Can you provide more details about golfer Jose Maria
Olazabal, winner of this year's Masters? An article mentioned that
as recently as three years ago, he couldn't walk without severe
pain, much less play golf, because of arthritis. How did he make
such a dramatic recovery?
</P>
<P>
   A: Olazabal was out of golf for 18 months because of foot
problems initially _ and mistakenly _ diagnosed as rheumatoid
arthritis. The pain was apparent when he won his first Masters in
1994, and it became unbearable near the end of 1995. He watched the
1996 Masters on TV. ``It was not very pleasant, watching the rest
of the players playing the Masters, knowing you have a right to be
here and not being able to play,'' he told The Associated Press.
``That made it really hard.''
</P>
<P>
   Then, while he was in Germany to be fitted for a special shoe,
Olazabal was treated by Dr. Hans-Wilhelm Muller-Wohlfahrt, who gave
the golfer injections for his lower back and prescribed an exercise
program. The problem was caused by two faulty vertebrae, which were
pinching nerves affecting Olazabal's feet.
</P>
<P>
   As the AP reported, Olazabal publicly thanked the doctor Sunday
after he won the Masters. ``Without him, I wouldn't be standing
here,'' the golfer said. ``I think I won this tournament because of
him.''
</P>
<P>

 (Repeating as part of a weekly roundup of computer features)  
Online diarists put it all on the line 
By Omar L. Gallaga  
c.1999 Cox News Service  
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ Pamie's on a rant at her Web site, ``Squishy'' _
this time about how relationships change over time, with a handy
``before and after'' guide. After a few months, she says,
television viewing for couples changes:
</P>
<P>
   ``You watch thirty minutes of `Law and Order' and he changes the
channel. `I only like the Law part,' he says. You watch ten minutes
of `Seinfeld.' The commercials come on. He flips, flips, flips,
flips and only pauses on women's golf. `I am not watching this' you
say. `I'm just watching the sports ticker,' he says. He flips back
to `Seinfeld,' just in time for the final `bah-chicka-bah-bah ...
pock-a-pooka-pock.'''
</P>
<P>
   ``Television time is his remote control,'' Pamela Ribon (known
as Pamie to her readers) writes on her Web site. Jump to another
Web site: Kramer Wetzel's ``Fishing Guide to the Stars.'' Wetzel is
excited because he just met Amy of ``Amy's Ice Cream'' fame.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've been singing a sweet song about her ice cream for
years,'' Wetzel writes. ``Finally I get to meet the person behind
it all. `Come on by and I'll buy you an ice cream,' she said to
me.''
</P>
<P>
   Television has MTV's ``The Real World.'' The big screen has
fictional versions life as we know it in ``Ed TV'' and ``The Truman
Show.''
</P>
<P>
   The Internet has online diaries such as Ribon's and Wetzel's
that turn life as they know it into virtual entertainment for their
readers.
</P>
<P>
   Some diarists just want to write. Others seek interaction with
readers. Still others have an exhibitionist streak.
</P>
<P>
   Either way, the episodic nature of online diaries makes them
popular daily reads, and a growing number of writers are opening up
their diaries to the world.
</P>
<P>
   According to Diarist.net, the most comprehensive list of Web
journals on the Internet, there are about 1,100 active diaries
online. That's not counting thousands more that are unknown or
unavailable to the public. Journals can be as varied as real-life
diaries; some are little more than detailed lists of each day's
events. Others are less linear, putting style over truth and taking
extreme liberties with reality.
</P>
<P>
   Ribon, who performs with the comedy troupe Monk's Night Out and
is in tech support at Tivoli Systems, and Wetzel, a professional
astrologer, are Austinites who have turned their lives into open
books _ or rather, open Web sites _ posting their daily diaries on
the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   They write about their triumphs (performing at an HBO showcase
in Los Angeles for Ribon, Wetzel's new passion for lawnmower
racing), their tragedies (a three-month ordeal in which Ribon went
through testing for cancer, a near-death experience Wetzel had last
year), and all the minutiae in between.
</P>
<P>
   When Ribon began writing ``Squishy'' last June, she figured it
was a good way to exercise her writing skills. Almost a year later,
she has 500 readers who log in daily for her autobiographical
comedic essays.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I was a kid I used to pretend that I was on `The Pam
Channel,' '' Ribon said. ``Other people say they did this as kids,
too _ believing you're exposing yourself to the world. I guess
`Squishy' is a grown-up version of `The Pam Channel,' only this
time it's not just my cat watching.''
</P>
<P>
   Ribon, who says the makers of ``The Truman Show'' ``totally took
my premise,'' writes about her parents, her boyfriend, her stage
performances and her work at Tivoli. When Wetzel began writing a
Web journal as an offshoot of his astrology Web site, his goal was
to chronicle his life and to write about his ongoing love affair
with Austin.
</P>
<P>
   ``Where else can you chronicle great things in Texas like
lawnmower racing on Auditorium Shores?'' he said in an interview.
``Can you think of a place that's weirder than Austin?''
</P>
<P>
   Wetzel said he's gotten in trouble in the past writing about
friends or romantic interests. In one instance, a woman who cuts
his hair was upset about a comment he made on site about a hair
streaking she'd performed.
</P>
<P>
   Deb, who asked that her last name not be used, recently removed
her online diary, ``Sometimes Deb,'' from the Web when the pressure
of keeping herself anonymous became too great.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would never give the Web address to someone I know in real
life,'' she said in an interview. ``I knew there'd be someone out
there reading it, but I didn't really have to deal with their
reactions.''
</P>
<P>
   The diarist's secret life
</P>
<P>
   Ryan Ozawa runs Diarist.net in Hawaii.
</P>
<P>
   ``Often times, online journals are just the next evolutionary
step for people who keep logs of changes to their sites, or people
who write open letters to their family members in lieu of
snail-mail letters or family newsletters,'' Ozawa said. ``Others
see it as therapy, shouting to the world things they might not be
able to whisper to even their closest friends.''
</P>
<P>
   There are also those who promote themselves as the product of
their Web journals. Many writers use their online journals as a way
of sparking interest in their work and some take the idea of an
online identity to another level by adding still photos or live
video. ``There's a certain level where you become a voice,'' Ribon
said. ``And whatever face you have isn't going to match the face
the readers have for you.''
</P>
<P>
   Deb posted a photo of herself with each daily entry. ``Taking a
picture of myself before I started writing was a way for me to
become introspective,'' she said. ``I go to work, take care of the
kids, but when I would sit down to write, I'd shift the focus to
myself.''
</P>
<P>
   In real life, Ribon and Wetzel could be your neighbor or an
office-mate.
</P>
<P>
   Wetzel, who uses Threadgill's World Headquarters restaurant as
his base of operations for astrology reports, has long hair, a
Texas tan and favors Hawaiian shirts and baggy shorts. He is
self-deprecating, using his Texan lifestyle to skewer
preconceptions readers may have about him: ``Just because I live in
a trailer park, and just because I have fishing poles and a dead
cow skull on my patio, and just because I take a serious dislike to
any kind of a tie besides a bolo tie, does that make a me a
redneck? `` he wrote recently. ``It's warmed up nice in Texas, and
anything besides a pair of shorts is probably too much attire. Is
that so wrong?
</P>
<P>
   When the mood strikes him _ if he's talking to a waitress who
says something particularly insightful or when he gets an
interesting e-mail from a reader, he'll sit down to write, his
short entries leaping in points of reference from ``King of the
Hill'' to ``As You Like It'' to Jupiter's position in the heavens.
``There's not a lot of people out there who can work Shakespeare
and lawnmower racing into a coherent metaphor,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Ribon, on the other hand, takes about an hour each day to write
an essay on a chosen topic. Ribon, who posts conversations from her
life as dialogue on ``Squishy,'' has written about everything from
nose trimmers to her childhood to her recent use of Tae-Bo exercise
videos.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have started to feel that tiny muscle that connects your hip
and your thigh. That is the first step to the new Pamie.'' she
wrote in one entry. ``I will have thighs like a stallion, a stomach
like... like a... flat...thing... I'll be the new me.''
</P>
<P>
   Meeting them, be warned: The conversation you're having might be
broadcast the next day, used as fuel for tomorrow's entry. ``I was
interviewed for the local paper yesterday afternoon about
`Squishy,''' Ribon wrote after an interview earlier this week.
</P>
<P>
   ``So, this Saturday there should be an article. And of course
now that hours have gone by since the interview I'm thinking to
myself, ``Did I say the right things?''
</P>
<P>
   And on Wetzel's site: ``I have nothing to fear from another
reporter. The interview went just fine.''

   COXNET FOOD 0420 _ When Southerners celebrate with a birthday

cream cake. Little is known about its origin _ except that it isn't
Italian, it contains no cream other than cheese and few outside the
South have ever heard of it. Doesn't matter. This blond, moist,
three-layer cake is the pride of both home and commercial bakers,
from Texas to Georgia. (Crider, Austin American-Statesman) Art

especially in the early years for growing and building bones and
muscles,'' Koehler said. ``They're good for getting the vitamin A's
and C's you need for a good start in life.'' Getting children
accustomed to eating a variety of fruits and veggies early on in

eating habits, nutrition experts say. (Mays, Waco Herald-Tribune)

 (Repeating as part of a weekly roundup of computer features)  
Net a great source for free images 
By Bill Husted  
c.1999 Cox News Service  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ In the earliest days of computing, graphics and images
weren't very important. It was much the same during the earliest
days of the Internet and the Web, it was a text-based world here in
cyberspace.
</P>
<P>
   That made good sense because images take up a lot of space _ and
storage memory was at a premium in those days. And, because image
files tend to be large, they took a long time to download or
display while online.
</P>
<P>
   But the world has changed with faster computers and connection
speeds. And, since many of us have personal Web pages, a good
source of free images can be important. They're also useful for
decorating homemade invitations, as accent points in letters and to
create projects for school. The Web is a great source for these
free images and, today, we'll find some of the best spots to get
the picture.
</P>
<P>
   If it's Web page art you'd like, there's a site just for you.
It's called Design-it.Net Free Resources and is located at
design-it.net/graphicsdesigners/freefram.htm. This is a good
resource for the sort of images you'll need for a Web page, but if
that was all this page offered, it wouldn't be too exceptional. The
Web is full of catalogs of art. It's an added feature that makes
this a valuable resource, a great collection of links to Web design
programs and tutorials. After all, it's not enough to just have the
art, you need to know how to use it.
</P>
<P>
   So, browse the links here and you'll find a great way to brush
up on your Web design skills. And it's fairly up-to-date with
information on using the animated images that, over the past couple
of years, have become popular in Web design.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, if animated images are your thing, we have a terrific
source that promises (and delivers) thousands of animated images
free for the downloading. You'll find that page at
www.auctionsww.com/freemall
</P>
<P>
   /animations.htm.
</P>
<P>
   You'll not only be impressed with the assortment of images
available here, you'll also like the way the page is organized. If
you've ever tried to search for a specific image on a page that
contains thousands of pictures with subject matter that ranges from
trees to trucks, you know what a chore it can be to find what you
want. But this page makes it easy with categories of images such as
sports, cartoons and signboards (made to be customized with your
own text and used as part of a Web page).
</P>
<P>
   The next Web page we'll visit offers instruction on using your
browser _ whether Netscape or Internet Explorer _ to download
images you find as part of a Web page you visit. The page, located
at webclipart.miningco.com
</P>
<P>
   /library/Tips/blhelp7.htm, has step-by-step instructions for
both PC and Macintosh users on grabbing images and saving them to
your computer. This will be a great help to many novices.
</P>
<P>
   There's one caveat we need to address. Some images are free and
available to anyone. But other images have copyrights and _ while
they can be downloaded _ it isn't legal or proper to do that. So
make sure, when you're mining the Web for images, you respect the
property of others and avoid violating copyright laws.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, since the image you need may be very specific, it could
be you'll need resources other than the usual Web libraries of clip
art we've mentioned. Use your favorite search engine to find the
image you want. Remember, you can use it to search for images, too.
Just include search terms such as ``clip art'' or ``image'' or
``download'' to narrow the search.

   Q: I wanted to see Julie Andrews in ``Victor/Victoria'' in
Houston, but that performance was canceled because of her throat
surgery. Since then I've heard she will never sing again. What's
the story?
</P>
<P>
   A: Andrews underwent throat surgery in 1997 to remove
non-cancerous nodules in her throat. She says it was described to
her as a routine procedure. Now, two years later, she remains
unable to sing and is contemplating a lawsuit. ``It is in the hands
of lawyers and we will make some decisions,'' she told London's
Daily Telegraph in February. Her husband, director Blake Edwards,
said last year he didn't think she would ever sing again. ``If you
heard her voice, you would weep,'' he said. ``It's an absolute
tragedy.'' Andrews, who was said at the time to be angered by
Edwards' comments, remains hopeful that her condition can be
reversed. ``I have to be optimistic,'' she told the Telegraph. ``I
think to some degree I'm in a form of denial about it. If I could
not sing with an orchestra . . . I think I would be devastated. . .
. Right now I simply can't contemplate it. I don't want to say that
I never can.''
</P>
<P>
   Q: I bought my first Big Game lottery ticket recently. The odds
of winning the least amount ($1) by getting only the Big Money Ball
is given as 1:62. Since there are 36 numbers from which to choose
one number, shouldn't it be 1:36?
</P>
<P>
   A: When calculating the odds for the $1 prize in the Big Game,
the formula is determined by the odds of getting one gold ``Big
Money'' ball correct within a field of 36, multiplied by the odds
of getting the five white balls in a field of 50 incorrect. So the
odds indeed are 1:62.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Organic gardening often utilizes cow, sheep and/or other
animal manure as fertilizers. Does this make the risk of E. coli or
other viral or bacterial exposure a possibility on the vegetables
harvested from that soil?
</P>
<P>
   A: It's possible. Organic production does in fact increase some
risks, said Paul Guillebeau, entomologist with the University of
Georgia Extension Service. In many cases, ``organic'' means that
the foods were grown with animal manures instead of chemical
fertilizers. So the risks from pesticides may be reduced, but the
possibility of contamination with fungal toxins, such as aflatoxin,
may be increased, Guillebeau said, citing research by the U.S. Food
and Drug Administration. Animal manure is the primary reservoir for
a virulent strain of E. coli. In 1996, the Centers for Disease
Control and Prevention in Atlanta confirmed nearly 2,500 cases of
this virulent strain, along with 250 deaths. Although organic foods
made up only 1 percent of the U.S. food supply during that time,
organics were implicated in 8 percent of the confirmed cases.
</P>
<P>
   While Guillebeau said he was not condemning organic foods, he
added that organic producers may exacerbate the problems because
they typically don't use chlorinated water or other disinfectants
before their products are sold.
</P>
<P>
   Q: How are dogs trained to sniff out drugs?
</P>
<P>
   A: A dog's sense of smell is said to be 50,000 times greater
than a human's, which enables it to detect microscopic scent
particles. Trainers and handlers of ``dedicated drugs dogs,'' as
such sniffers are called, introduce them to the scent of a
particular controlled drug _ even small amounts of cocaine,
marijuana, heroin _ early in their training. The trainers and
handlers use play, praise and patience to encourage the dog's
natural foraging instincts. When the dog detects the drug's scent,
it alerts its handler, and usually is rewarded with praise or its
favorite toy.
</P>
<P>
   Commonly used sniffer breeds include Labrador retrievers,
English springer spaniels and German shepherds. Several companies,
including the Vonderhaus Gill German Shepherd Training School in
Wapakoneta, Ohio, and Kontraband Interdiction &AMP; Detection Services
of Modesto, Calif., train the dogs.
</P>
<P>
   Q: A federal judge has fined the American Airlines pilots' union
more than $45 million for refusing his back-to-work order during
the February ``sickout.'' Where does that money go?
</P>
<P>
   A: The Allied Pilots Union fine must be paid directly to AMR
Group, the parent of American Airlines.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Before the days of cordless and cell phones, people were
advised to avoid talking on their telephones during thunder and
lightning storms. Is there a similar danger if using cordless
equipment?
</P>
<P>
   A: Not if the person using the wireless phone is indoors and
protected, according to the Cellular Telecommunications Industry
Association in Washington. It's not recommended when outdoors,
however. A CTIA spokesman said you shouldn't have any piece of
metal touching or near your body when outdoors in a thunder or
lightning storm. A mobile phone contains pieces of metal, and if
you're talking on it, you're holding the metal-containing device
next to your head. That's not a good idea, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Q: What did Samuel R. Berger do before he became the national
security adviser for the United States?
</P>
<P>
   A: During President Clinton's first term in office, Sandy
Berger's title was deputy assistant to the president for national
security affairs. In that position, he served as chairman of the
Deputies Committee of the National Security Council, the
sub-Cabinet interagency group charged with coordination of foreign
policy. Before that, he was Clinton's senior foreign policy adviser
during the 1992 presidential campaign and assistant transition
director for national security of the 1992 Clinton-Al Gore
transition.
</P>
<P>
   Berger's prior experience in government includes having served
as special assistant to former New York Mayor John Lindsay;
legislative assistant for former Sen. Harold Hughes (D-Iowa) and
Rep. Joseph Resnick (D-N.Y.); and deputy director of the State
Department's policy planning staff.
</P>
<P>
   He also worked in the State Department during the administration
of President Jimmy Carter, and was a speechwriter in 1972 for
George McGovern's presidential campaign. Additionally, Berger
practiced law with the Washington law firm of Hogan &AMP; Hartson
(1973-77 and 1981-92). He received his BA degree from Cornell
University in 1967 and his J.D. degree from Harvard Law School in
1971.
</P>
<P>
   Q: I saw that detectives in Texas were searching in a field for
the body of renowned atheist Madalyn Murray O'Hair. Do you have any
information?
</P>
<P>
   A: On Easter weekend, federal authorities _ acting on
information from seven-time felon Gary P. Karr, suspected as an
accessory in the 1995 disappearance of O'Hair and her family _ dug
up portions of a 5,000-acre ranch west of San Antonio. As last
report they were refusing to say what, if anything, they found.
</P>
<P>
   The Austin Statesman-American reported that on March 24, Karr
had spent 13 hours voluntarily talking to investigators at his
apartment in Novi, Mich. While the newspaper said he didn't confess
to the killings of O'Hair; her son, Jon Garth Murray; and the
granddaughter she adopted as her own daughter, Robin Murray-O'Hair,
he did admit to concealing bodies, hiding victims' property,
acquiring vehicles and playing a key role in transferring $600,000
to a San Antonio gold dealer. The San Antonio Express-News,
meanwhile, has quoted FBI agent William O'Leary as testifying that
Karr has admitted an ``extensive role'' in the three deaths as well
as that of one other person, and has told the FBI the city where
the victoms' bodies were buried.
</P>
<P>
   Many questions in the case remain unanswered. David Roland
Waters, a former O'Hair employee convicted in 1995 of stealing
$54,000 from O'Hair's American Atheists organization, also is being
questioned. He is in jail in Austin after being arrested on weapons
charges and Karr, also arrested on weapons charges, is in jail in
Detroit. Waters' Austin attorney, Patrick Ganne, said he believes
authorities are ``waiting for one to break,'' but he insisted that
his client has nothing to tell authorities.
</P>
<P>
   Q: I've read a lot about NATO's military intervention in
Yugoslavia, but I haven't seen any explanation about its stated
motive or where it derives its authority. Can you elaborate?
</P>
<P>
   A: The stated motive is safeguarding international peace and
security, as permitted under the U.N. Charter. Just before NATO
began its bombardment campaign, A. Peter Burleigh, acting U.S.
ambassador to the United Nations, said the U.N. Security Council
gave NATO that authority in October when it called for a cease-fire
in Kosovo under the council's Chapter VII, or war-making,
authority.
</P>
<P>
   Russia and China have voiced strong opposition, saying NATO's
claim to be safeguarding international peace and security is
forbidden to regional alliances without specific authority from the
Security Council. But 13 of NATO's 19 members are participating in
the attacks on Yugoslav military forces, and three of the five
Security Council members with veto power over resolutions _ the
United States, Britain and France _ are participants in the NATO
bombing campaign. So Russia and China are making little headway.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Is Andrea Koppel of CNN related to Ted Koppel? It's not a
common name.
</P>
<P>
   A: She's Ted's daughter.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Equifax recently ran a full-page newspaper ad saying it has a
history of ``100 years in business changing the shape of global
commerce.'' I've seen its headquarters building in Atlanta, but I
have no idea what the company does. Can you explain?
</P>
<P>
   A: Its global operations involve the financial services, retail,
credit card, telecommunications/utilities, transportation,
information technology and healthcare industries, as well as
government. Hoover's Handbook of American Business says Equifax,
the nation's largest consumer credit reporter, approves check
purchases, processes credit card applications and transactions,
provides database marketing consulting services, and develops
credit-scoring software. Its customers run the gamut from banks and
other financial institutions to hotels and retailers.
</P>
<P>
   The company traces its roots to 1899, when brothers Cator and
Guy Woolford started Retail Credit Co. in Atlanta. They compiled
credit records of local residences into their Merchants Guide,
which they sold to retailers for $25 a year. The brothers extended
their services to the insurance industry in 1901, investigating the
backgrounds of insurance applicants. After several decades, Retail
Credit branched into other information sectors, and in 1976 changed
its name to Equifax (short for ``equitability in the gathering and
presentation of facts'').
</P>
<P>
   There are two other large personal credit reporting bureaus are
TransUnion and Experian, formerly known as TRW.

<P>
   Q: My Girl Scout troop wants to send mail to U.S. service
personnel involved in the Kosovo operation. What is the address?
</P>
<P>
   A: For Army, Navy, Air Force and Marine Corps land forces: Any
Service Member, Operation Joint Forge, APO AE 09397-000.
</P>
<P>
   For Navy and Marine Corps personnel aboard ships: Any Service
Member, Operation Joint Forge, FPO AE 09398-0001.

</P>
<P>
   The Defense Department says no packages can be sent for security
reasons. Only first-class mail, with a maximum weight of 13 ounces,
is acceptable. Mail transit time from the continental United States
to the Balkans averages 8-10 days. Information: 1-800- 841-0937
(press 2).
</P>
<P>
   Q: America's consumption of chicken _ fingers, wings, nuggets,
strips, breasts, thighs, legs _ is unbelievable. Just how many
chickens are raised in the United States to feed this insatiable
appetite?
</P>
<P>
   A: The numbers are astonishing, and growing steadily. Eight
billion chickens are raised in the United States each year, says
Richard Lobb of the National Chicken Council in Washington. About
83 percent of that total is for U.S. consumption, with the
remainder exported. Americans consume about 75 pounds of chicken
per person, per year, Lobb said, with the U.S. Department of
Agriculture predicting that number may rise to 78-79 pounds per
person in 1999.
</P>
<P>
   Q: My wife, three children and I were at Atlanta Stadium that
cool April night in 1974 when Henry Aaron broke Babe Ruth's career
home run record. I don't remember seeing the number of games it
took for each player. Did Hank do it in fewer or more games than
Ruth?
</P>
<P>
   A: It took Aaron 467 more games than Ruth to reach 714 home
runs. Ruth did it in 2,498 games; Aaron in 2,965, said Frank Vito
of the Baseball Hall of Fame in Cooperstown, N.Y. Aaron broke
Ruth's record by hitting his 715th home run on April 8, 1974. In
his career, Aaron played in 3,298 games over 23 years; Ruth played
in 2,503 games over 22 years.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Where can we write the judge in the Jack Kevorkian case to
express our opinion on his sentencing?
</P>
<P>
   A: Judge Jessica Cooper of the Oakland County (Mich.) Circuit
Court is not soliciting or encouraging comments, said a spokeswoman
in Cooper's chambers. ``This is a court of law, not a court of
public opinion,'' the spokeswoman added. Nevertheless, she said
letters can be addressed to: Judge Jessica Cooper, Oakland County
Courthouse, Pontiac, MI 48341.
</P>
<P>
   Q: How can contributions for Kosovo relief be made to the
organization that Billy Graham's son heads?
</P>
<P>
   A: You're referring to Franklin Graham's Samaritan's Purse,
which has worked in the Balkans since the region erupted in ethnic
conflict in 1991. During that time, it has provided more than $12
million in aid to Bosnia and other Balkan countries, the
organization says. Contributions can be sent to: Samaritan's Purse,
P.O. Box 3000, Boone, NC 28607. For more information, call its
Kosovo crisis hotline: 1-800-665-2843. Online information:

</P>
<P>
   Q: I recently saw a silly movie on TV called ``Biosphere.'' It
made me wonder: What happened to the biodome or biosphere that
several scientists lived in some years ago? It seems to have
dropped out of the news.
</P>
<P>
   A: The attempt to build an enclosed, self-sustaining
``mini-Earth'' ecosystem did indeed drop out of the news because,
in the end, the $150 million dream of Texas billionaire Edward P.
Bass was a flop. Four men and four women sealed themselves into
Biosphere II on Sept. 26, 1991, planning to live there without
leaving for two years. The airtight Biosphere II named after what
the researchers called Biosphere I, which is Earth _ covered 3
acres in Oracle, Ariz., with seven different climate zones in a
glass and steel greenhouse.
</P>
<P>
   The inhabitants intended to grow their own food and recycle
their waste, receiving nothing from the outside world except
sunlight and electricity. Their hope was to study the interlocking
dynamics of Earth's ecology, with the data they obtained perhaps
applicable to colonizing space or gauging the feasibility of
building similar refuges on Earth to preserve life in the event of
a catastrophe such as nuclear war. Critics were skeptical from the
start, calling it a ``scientific crapshoot'' and a ``Disneyland.''
</P>
<P>
   Problems weren't long in coming. On Dec. 9, 1991, operators of
Biosphere II acknowledged that outside air had been pumped into the
facilityto compensate for leakage. They denied that the move was
taken to deal with a rising carbon dioxide level, or that it
invalidated the experiment. And one member brought supplies back
from the outside after leaving the facility for surgery on a
wounded finger.
</P>
<P>
   The eight researchers emerged on Sept. 26, 1993. The team had
produced about 80 percent of its food, but suffered several crop
failures due to swarms of mites and other insects. In 1994, two
original crew members were accused of sabotaging the project, and
Bass, citing mismanagement of funds, fired several top officers and
ordered private police to seize the project. Q: Recent talk about
the downed Stealth fighter makes me wonder if our armed forces
considered trying to destroy the remains of the fallen aircraft,
once the pilot was rescued. Would such a thing be considered to
prevent sensitive technology from falling into the wrong hands?
</P>
<P>
   A: It's standard U.S. military procedure, when a plane of such
technological value crashes, either to recover the pieces or to
bomb them, for the very reason you suggest. Recovery attempts seem
to be more likely, with no information available to suggest past
use of the bombing option. Such was the case in 1997, when an F-117
crashed during an air show near Baltimore. Air Force officials
sealed off the residential crash site and scoured the area for even
tiny pieces of debris. Mechanical reasons were blamed for that
crash.
</P>
<P>
   In the March 27 incident in Yugoslavia, a large number of pieces
of the F-117 Nighthawk fighter-bomber remained intact, and Serbs
reportedly gave some of the pieces to the Russians, who reportedly
haven't yet developed their own stealth technology.
</P>
<P>
   Although Air Force and other analysts said the technologies
employed in creating the Nighthawk are outmoded, and what little
could be discerned from the pieces wouldn't be significant, other
analysts aren't so sure. They contend that enemy scientists could
glean enough clues from the debris to develop their own
radar-evading technology. In any case, the Pentagon has publicly
played down concerns about the matter.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Can you provide more details about golfer Jose Maria
Olazabal, winner of this year's Masters? An article mentioned that
as recently as three years ago, he couldn't walk without severe
pain, much less play golf, because of arthritis. How did he make
such a dramatic recovery?
</P>
<P>
   A: Olazabal was out of golf for 18 months because of foot
problems initially _ and mistakenly _ diagnosed as rheumatoid
arthritis. The pain was apparent when he won his first Masters in
1994, and it became unbearable near the end of 1995. He watched the
1996 Masters on TV. ``It was not very pleasant, watching the rest
of the players playing the Masters, knowing you have a right to be
here and not being able to play,'' he told The Associated Press.
``That made it really hard.''
</P>
<P>
   Then, while he was in Germany to be fitted for a special shoe,
Olazabal was treated by Dr. Hans-Wilhelm Muller-Wohlfahrt, who gave
the golfer injections for his lower back and prescribed an exercise
program. The problem was caused by two faulty vertebrae, which were
pinching nerves affecting Olazabal's feet.
</P>
<P>
   As the AP reported, Olazabal publicly thanked the doctor Sunday
after he won the Masters. ``Without him, I wouldn't be standing
here,'' the golfer said. ``I think I won this tournament because of
him.''
</P>
<P>
   End of two takes.

 (Repeating as part of a weekly roundup of computer features)  
Net a new dimension in the coverage of war 
By Frances Katz  
c.1999 Cox News Service  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ These are stories about life during wartime.
Real-time, ``you are there'' stories of how people cope daily when
the bombs are dropping nightly.
</P>
<P>
   Only in the age of the Internet could these wartime dramas come
from Belgrade radio station B92 (www.b92.org). That's the
independent Serbian radio station the government shut down April 2.
The station signed off with the words, ``We will never surrender.''
</P>
<P>
   Last May, Matt Drudge, the one-man Web-based gossip machine who
broke the Monica Lewinsky scandal, spoke to a skeptical crowd at
the Harvard Conference on Internet and Society. The crowd took a
dim view of Drudge's ``one-man-band'' approach to journalism, while
he insisted that in the future anyone with a computer and a modem
could become a publisher and report exactly what they want, and do
it just the way they feel it should be reported.
</P>
<P>
   While Drudge has pretty much dropped off the national radar, in
Serbia there are hundreds of populist journalists bringing their
own perspective to the war _ from angry condemnations of NATO, to
pleas for peace, to simple descriptions of everyday life.
</P>
<P>
   Even though B92 was shut down, a mirror site was immediately set
up in the Netherlands called ``Help B92'' (helpb92.xs4all.nl/). The
site continues to tell the stories of the people of Yugoslavia with
a special section called ``Personal Diaries.'' The diaries are
stories of the station's friends and colleagues who post, under
their own names, their personal wartime experiences.
</P>
<P>
   ``To whom it may concern and to everyone who cares,'' begins one
diary. The writer is from Batajnica, a suburb of Belgrade not far
from a military airbase. He writes, ``I have been in Batajnica up
till now but the situation has become unbearable and terrifying.
The people of this community rarely have the chance to leave the
air raid shelters, since bombs are falling ever closer to my home,
day and night, with few and short interruptions of cease-fire. The
shelters are literally packed with people.''
</P>
<P>
   One of the most chilling accounts comes from Vladislava Gordic,
an assistant professor of American and English literature at the
University of Novi Sad. Nightly, she says, she runs back and forth
from the air raid shelter to get her computer and use it to get her
story out to the world, ``as long as phone lines and my modem
permit, I will keep on writing, taking this down.''
</P>
<P>
   Writing of her experiences, she says she is reminded of a Kate
Bush lyric, ``As people around me grow colder, I turn to my
computer.'' She writes of trying to keep up her daily routines _
going to the university to check her mail and talk with the
students still coming to class, along with daily shopping trips to
stock up on supplies.
</P>
<P>
   She notes that as the bombings intensify, so do the items people
consider essential. ``In pharmacie (sic) everybody is asking for
the cheapest tranquilizer _ bensedin. ... The only person I know
that is not taking anything is me, even though everybody else in my
family is taking, not to speak about friends and colleagues. ...
The most animated debates often are around this topic _ what to
take, when and in what quantity.''
</P>
<P>
   Ducking in terror in air raid shelters, talking with friends
about the best tranquilizers to cope with another round of bombs _
this is what life is like in Yugoslavia right now, today. As
freedom of the press literally grinds to a halt in Serbia and
Kosovo, these online diarists sending e-mail from air raid shelters
are one of the few ways the rest of the world can find out about
the war and its aftermath.
</P>
<P>
   In the United States, the online community Egroups also posts as
many daily dispatches as it can on a discussion list called
Kosovo-Reports (www.egroups.com/list/kosovo-reports). It features
postings from anyone actually living in Yugoslavia. Most of the
postings are from Serbs vehemently attacking NATO's bombing
campaign.
</P>
<P>
   One list member, Zoran Radoslavjevic, writes that he was sitting
and talking to friends when the bombings began in his town. ``We
knew from cable TV that bombardment would start. But somehow, no
one seemed to believe that, at the end of the 20th century, such
thing was possible. OK, but why Novi Sad, the most peaceful
multiethnical town, that knows no bounderies (sic) among the
nationalities? Suddenly we heard the terrible detonation,
earthquake? No, it has began (sic). We rushed down the stairs, no
sirenes (sic), just children screaming, women crying. ... The
shelter was locked, nowhere to go.... We stood in the street, in
shock, in despair.''

 &HT;    Cancer support group channels energy into cookbook
 &HT;    By Marcia Langhenry
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Erica McVicker's co-workers liked her better bald than
wearing the wig that gave her a big headache.
</P>
<P>
   And her sister was kind enough to listen to all the medical
jargon when McVicker was too overwhelmed to concentrate.
</P>
<P>
   Still, after a diagnosis of breast cancer three years ago, the
Atlanta resident needed a way to listen and vent to women who could
understand her feelings.
</P>
<P>
   But a support group?
</P>
<P>
   ``The thought of going and sitting in a room with other women
with breast cancer was just too heart-wrenching for me,'' McVicker,
45, said.
</P>
<P>
   What she found instead is electronic communication with women
from Alabama to Australia who've found many other common interests,
including food, and have just published a fund-raising cookbook.
</P>
<P>
   McVicker's sister, Susan Antinori, also of Atlanta, found
Sapient Health Network, a Web site (now www.webmd.com) that offers
information on many chronic medical conditions and online chatting.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nobody's a stranger when you go on the board there. You can go
in, or you don't have to. You can stay away for three weeks. People
ask about you but they know you need the downtime,'' McVicker said.
</P>
<P>
   Out of treatment for more than two years, the systems
administrator for the Bondurant, Mixson &AMP; Elmore law firm continues
to check in with her online friends, many of whom she has met in
person.
</P>
<P>
   Last spring the chat group had its second face-to-face meeting.
When McVicker told friends and family of her plans to go to
Memphis, Tenn., she said some wondered about the safety of
in-person meetings with people met online. Others wondered aloud:
``Are you going to sit around and be morose and show your scars?''
</P>
<P>
   What she found, instead, were instant friendships and a
surprising dose of humor, hope and curiosity about the women's
condition. Food, too, seemed to be a constant topic _ perhaps
because they are women, many with families to nourish, McVicker
said.
</P>
<P>
   Their energies were funneled into a cookbook, ``Hope, Laughter &AMP;
Delicious Dishes.'' The just-published book has more than 450 of
their best recipes, plus 35 of their breast cancer stories of hope.
Profits from the book will raise money for the Susan G. Komen
Breast Cancer Foundation, which funds research and awareness
programs.
</P>
<P>
   ``We got to talking about it and wanted to do a little
something, maybe, to say we're doing our part to get rid of this
nasty disease,'' Sue Biley said.
</P>
<P>
   Members worldwide sent recipes and stories to Biley in Iowa, who
added many of her own and sent them along to Sharon Ann Basile in
New Jersey, who got them ready for publication.
</P>
<P>
   For McVicker and others whose stories are included in the book,
the support has been invaluable. The only negative, she says, is
watching as more and more women are diagnosed and come to the Web
site looking for information and conversation.
</P>
<P>
   ``Every day new people are asking for help to deal with this
aspect of chemo or radiation, to ask, `Are my eyelashes going to
go, too?' Or, `Is there anybody out there like me?'''
</P>
<P>
   There is, she assures.

U.S. URGES NEW RULES TO GUARD PRIVACY OF CHILDREN ON INTERNET 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Repeating as part of a weekly roundup of computer features)   By STEPHEN LABATON   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The federal government proposed new rules Tuesday
to protect the privacy interests of children on the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   The rules, prepared by the Federal Trade Commission, would
require commercial Web sites to obtain parental consent before
seeking information from children under 13. They would also require
the sites to post notifications about what they do with any
information they obtain from children.
</P>
<P>
   The proposal comes after a new law expanding the agency's
authority on privacy issues. That legislation moved through
Congress quickly last fall after studies by the government and
experts showed that the vast majority of Web sites collect personal
information from consumers and children, and that very few
companies provide notice about what they do with such information.
</P>
<P>
   ``Kids are a particularly vulnerable audience,'' said Robert
Pitofsky, chairman of the FTC. ``You mix the invasions of privacy
with kids and you have a particularly combustible mix.''
</P>
<P>
   Web sites that ask children to provide personal information
about themselves and their families have proliferated in recent
years. Sometimes the sites offer prizes in exchange for
information.
</P>
<P>
   Children who want to win a Nintendo Game Boy from the Blue Bunny
ice cream trucks can register at Bombpop.com by supplying their
name, address, age, e-mail address and favorite kind of ice cream.
The Web site does not say what it does with the information.
</P>
<P>
   At another site, run by the Liberty Fund, a large asset manager
in Boston, children are asked questions about their family's
finances, including whether their parents use mutual funds or
brokers, whether the children have received bonds or stocks as
gifts, and what the family does with its money. The site,
www.younginvestor.com, says that the surveys are ``completely
anonymous'' but that the Web site also uses cookies _ information
that Web sites record on a computer's hard drive to track the
user's comings and goings.
</P>
<P>
   A study by the FTC last June concluded that 89 percent of
children's sites surveyed collected personal information from
children and that few of the sites tried to provide for meaningful
parental involvement in the process. The study found that only 23
percent of the sites even tell children to seek parental permission
before providing personal information, 7 percent say they will
notify parents of their information practices, and less than 10
percent provide for parental control over either the collection or
use of the information gleaned from their children.
</P>
<P>
   After that study, Congress passed a law last October proposed by
the FTC that gave the agency wide authority to adopt new rules that
would protect the privacy interests of children and their families.
</P>
<P>
   If, as expected, the proposed rules are approved this year by
the commission's four members, compliance would provide a ``safe
harbor'' from government lawsuits for improper trade practices.
</P>
<P>
   The proposal applies to any commercial Web sites directed to, or
that knowingly collect information from, children under 13 years of
age. It would require companies to obtain ``verifiable parental
consent'' through various means. Web sites can provide a consent
form that would be signed by the parents and returned by postal
mail or facsimile, take credit card numbers from parents, offer a
toll-free number that parents could call, or accept e-mail
accompanied by a unique ``digital signature'' that demonstrates
that the e-mail was not sent by the child.
</P>
<P>
   Privacy experts have warned that standard e-mail is not
sufficient because children can easily send what appears to be
their parents' consent.
</P>
<P>
   ``Generally, the proposal looks pretty good,'' said Katharina
Kopp, a senior policy analyst at the Center for Media Education, a
Washington research and advocacy group that has pushed for the
rules. ``But the FTC could have given stricter guidance that
e-mail, by itself, does not work to provide verifiable parental
consent.''
</P>
<P>
   Industry lobbyists, however, have argued in favor of a wide
latitude in developing mechanisms to get parental consent.
</P>
<P>
   ``We believe there should be broad flexibility,'' said Jerry
Cerasale, a leading lobbyist for the Direct Marketing Association,
which represents 4,600 companies that use the Internet, telephones
and mail to sell their products.
</P>
<P>
   Some privacy experts said the rules would be hollow without a
vigorous enforcement program in which the FTC would audit a sample
of companies to assure that they are getting adequate consent and
following their own privacy guidelines.
</P>
<P>
   ``The most important piece of this policy will be whether the
FTC verifies what the companies are actually doing,'' said Jason
Catlett, president of Junkbusters Corp., which promotes consumer
protection on the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   Pitofsky suggested that the agency would be vigorous in
enforcing any rules that are ultimately adopted.
</P>
<P>
   ``Unless there's a monitoring mechanism to see what people do
when they say they are abiding by the rules, the rules are an empty
gesture,'' he said.

AUTHOR EXPOSES THE DANGERS OF GLOBAL WARMING 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By JANE KAY  
 c.1999 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ As the United States approaches the millennium
burdened with worry over the ailing planet, a new book by
environmentalist Mark Hertsgaard provides a valuable perspective on
global environmental problems and the potential solutions.
</P>
<P>
   Hertsgaard sharpened his hard-headed progressive politics and
writing style at Mother Jones, Vanity Fair and the New Yorker and
he's written books on the press' pliable relationship with Ronald
Reagan and the vast corporate power behind the nuclear industry.
</P>
<P>
   ``Earth Odyssey: Around the World in Search of Our Environmental
Future'' highlights ecological challenges the author discovered in
his travels.
</P>
<P>
   Hertsgaard said that on the Ethiopian-Sudanese border he found
farmers suffering from drought sweeping the Horn of Africa, perhaps
an early consequence of global warming. Fleeing starvation and
political violence, these Dinka people know they can't take nature
for granted.
</P>
<P>
   ``Many Americans and Europeans, especially those living in
cities, have grown so distanced from the natural world that they
seem to think they could live without it,'' Hertsgaard writes.
``But let thunderstorms knock out the electricity for their
computers and televisions, or let political turbulence shut off the
supply of gasoline to their cars, and those same individuals would
soon be as helpless as bugs in a jar.''
</P>
<P>
   One in six people in the world lives the life of the Dinkas,
famished and probably ill. And that, writes Hertsgaard, is at the
heart of the ecological predicament of the human species.
</P>
<P>
   He began his intermittent travels for the book _ suggested by
former New Yorker editor William Shawn _ at the Earth Summit in
1992 wondering whether humans would last 100 years. By the
journey's end, he had met many people who may not live 100 days.
</P>
<P>
   Hertsgaard is reminded that when dealing with their
environmental problems, Asia, Africa and South America must also
confront issues of poverty and development as well as distribution
and fairness.
</P>
<P>
   ``If the planet's atmosphere has space for only a certain level
of greenhouse gases, then humans must work out a means of sharing
that space. If the Earth's fisheries, forests and farmland can
supply only a certain amount of resources without collapsing, then
humans must agree on how those resources should be divided,''
Hertsgaard writes.
</P>
<P>
   ``Right now, the bulk of the Earth's environmental space is
being claimed by the United States and the other wealthy nations of
the North. But this cannot last.''
</P>
<P>
   He said that even if alternative energies are developed and used
by developing nations, they ``will still generate substantial
amounts of pollution.
</P>
<P>
   ``China and India, with their gigantic populations and ambitious
development plans, could by themselves all but doom the rest of the
world to severe global warming if they chose.''
</P>
<P>
   As part of extraordinary economic growth fueled by the World
Bank, factories belch pollutants. Forests and wetlands are cleared,
and canals paved over. People newly able to buy cars complain about
losing 44 days a year stuck in traffic jams, yet don't reduce
driving. Mass transit is inadequate.
</P>
<P>
   The internal combustion engine is a prime culprit behind global
climate change. Cars consume one-third of the world's oil output,
Hertsgaard writes. The car driving 100,000 miles at 27.5 miles per
gallon emits nearly 35 tons of carbon dioxide.
</P>
<P>
   The world's 500 million cars are responsible for between 20 and
25 percent of current greenhouse gas emissions. Only electric power
plants with 25 percent and deforestation with 25 percent are as
damaging.
</P>
<P>
   With motor traffic expected to increase by 60 percent over the
next 20 years, the United Nations Population Fund has projected
that by 2025, developing countries could be emitting four times as
much carbon dioxide as the industrialized countries do today.
</P>
<P>
   Motor vehicles are the world's single largest source of air
pollution. Emissions of carbon monoxide, nitrogen oxide and
volatile organic compounds cause an estimated $93 billion worth of
damage to health and the environment every year in the United
States, according to the Worldwatch Institute in 1993.
</P>
<P>
   As Hertsgaard travels the world, he compiles information on U.S.
energy consumption, evolutionary time lines and global
deforestation, extinction of species and population growth.
</P>
<P>
   The world's environmental future is more at stake in China than
any other place on Earth, according to Hertsgaard.
</P>
<P>
   On a trip to China, his guide was He Bochuan, the author of
``China on the Edge,'' the first book written by a Chinese native
about China' environmental challenges.
</P>
<P>
   He, out of favor in China, took Hertsgaard to a neighborhood
where canals were literally black with garbage and feces. Pedaling
on bicycles on ground littered with plastic bags and food cartons,
He pointed to new concrete houses lining the canals.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're four and five stories tall, they have television,
carpeting, air-conditioning, refrigerator: The indoor environment
is quite nice.
</P>
<P>
   ``These houses belong to the richest migrant, peasants who
became wealthy after selling their farmland. That farmland is now
gone forever, and the peasants are living in these filthy
surroundings and causing environmental problems for the entire
society. So is this progress? Or is it something else?''
</P>
<P>
   Yet Hertsgaard sees an opportunity for China _ a nation of more
than 1 billion people _ to install clean, efficient technologies.
</P>
<P>
   It's simply not true, Hertsgaard said, that replacing polluting
activities means crushing the economy. In Germany and other
countries, he sees that repairing the environment can become one of
the biggest businesses of the coming century.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS.) &QL; 
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Hertsgaard has written a New Deal-like Global Green Deal in
which governments would eliminate built-in, unwise subsidies to
fossil fuels, such as highway funding that doesn't measure the
economic cost of the resulting air pollution.
</P>
<P>
   Just as the United States won the race to the moon, it could
commit to a new mission: Relying on market mechanisms, while
zealously supporting alternative fuels for cars, mass transit and
solar energy; renovating buildings with advanced energy efficiency
methods so air-conditioning is unnecessary; and requiring farmers
to install super-efficient drip irrigations systems.
</P>
<P>
   The moral of Hertsgaard's story on this last Earth Day of the
millennium?
</P>
<P>
   ``The outlook is uncertain, the hour late, the Earth a place of
both beauty and despair. The fight for what's right is never
ending, but the rewards are immense. Humans may or may not be able
to stop the drift toward ecological disaster, but we will find out
only if we rouse ourselves and take common and determined action. I
wish us godspeed.''

 &HT;    SHORTTAKES: The outsider strikes back
 &HT;    By Arnold Rosenfeld
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   As this is written the day after the Littleton tragedy, the dead
have finally been counted. Themes have emerged: Outsiders. Revenge.
Murder. Suicide. Hitler. Nazism. Medievalism. Racism. Black coats.
Ski masks. Bombs. Guns. A proud and prosperous technocracy's
burdens stirred into an occult brew, eye of toad, tail of rat.
</P>
<P>
   Mass murder in the U.S. is the crime of the outsider. The
killers, usually white and male, take revenge for the lousy things
that have happened in life. They could probably pass the classic
test for legal insanity. Barbarity makes sense. Revenge becomes
virtue.
</P>
<P>
   Add to this now the Internet and the Global Village. Peculiar
isolates of all flavors think they are cogs in great movements. A
board game, Dungeons and Dragons, becomes a way of life, a
philosophy, a path.
</P>
<P>
   The peculiar thing about Columbine High was more than its naked
horror. It was its sense of closeness, the story we can all fear.
Littleton, however far away and in all its aspects, felt like a
local story.

TEXAN BUYS RENOWNED ATHEIST'S DIARIES 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By JOHN MacCORMACK  
 c.1999 San Antonio Express-News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ The diaries and personal papers of missing
atheist leader Madalyn Murray O'Hair sold for $12,000 after a brief
but spirited auction outside a federal bankruptcy courtroom.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's an investment. I'm not so much an admirer as an
entrepreneur,'' said Jimmy Nassour, 43, an Austin lawyer who made
the high bid Tuesday. In January, Nassour bid $2,000 for an
inscribed Bible that belonged to O'Hair.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think the diaries will provide a real insight into the real
Madalyn Murray O'Hair. You have someone who probably did incredible
things for the First Amendment, yet was deemed the most hated woman
in America,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Moments after the auction, Bankruptcy Court Judge Frank Monroe
approved the sale of what was the last asset in the liquidation of
the O'Hair estate.
</P>
<P>
   Court-appointed trustee Ron Ingalls said more than $240,000 in
unpaid claims against the O'Hair estate remain, most owed to the
Internal Revenue Service.
</P>
<P>
   Ingalls had received approval from Monroe to auction the diaries
in hopes of raising more money. Going into the auction, a pending
high bid of $8,888.88 had been received from an Austin man who
asked not to be identified.
</P>
<P>
   A third man, Stanley Main of Austin, who weeks ago had the
highest pending offer at $6,500, remained a mute bystander.
</P>
<P>
   ``I enjoyed the whole process. I was only in it as a lark,''
Main said.
</P>
<P>
   For his money, Nassour got the personal diaries of the woman who
was America's most famous atheist, from 1953 _ six years before she
filed her landmark lawsuit against prayer in public schools _ to
August 1995 _ weeks before she disappeared.
</P>
<P>
   There are two significant gaps in the handwritten diaries: One
covering the 1960s and the second covering all but a few weeks of
the final five years. It is unknown if those volumes exist, or if
they were ever written.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, Nassour now owns a collection of O'Hair's personal
papers and family photographs, several books and video tapes, and
various personal documents, including her military records.
</P>
<P>
   O'Hair, her son Jon Garth Murray, and daughter Robin Murray
O'Hair have been missing since late September 1995, when they
vanished from San Antonio along with $500,000 in gold.
</P>
<P>
   Authorities believe they were kidnapped and murdered, and two
men who are suspects in the case are currently being held on
unrelated charges. One has reportedly implicated himself and the
second man in the O'Hair disappearances.
</P>
<P>

</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS.) &QL; 
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The diaries present a different side to the blustering,
belligerent O'Hair, one in which she speaks tenderly of her
children, anxiously about her waistline and wearily of the burdens
of the atheist cause.
</P>
<P>
   In a typical entry, on Jan. 6, 1973, O'Hair recorded her hopes
for the new year.
</P>
<P>
   ``You, dear diary, are the only one who listens to me, so I'll
tell you what I want to do. File at least a couple of suits and win
one of them, get a building, get a Bible Chair at the University of
Texas, get a mink coat and a Cadillac, humiliate Billy Graham for
money and move into a bigger and better home,'' she wrote.
</P>
<P>
   Nassour, who said he bought the diaries with an eye toward their
value for a book or movie, doubts their author will reappear to
claim them.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've never been given any indication that she's anything but
deceased,'' he said.

SATIRE INVADES ALIEN WORLDS OF WASHINGTON POLITICS, UFO BELIEVERS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 
Little Green Men 
Christopher Buckley (Random House, $24.95) 
 
 By BILL GOODYKOONTZ  
 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Paranoid. Rumormongers. Fanatical believers.
</P>
<P>
   Funny how the words that apply to UFO enthusiasts also paint a
knowing picture of Washington political insiders.
</P>
<P>
   Especially funny in the hands of Christopher Buckley, who, along
with Ian Frazier, sits atop the list of truly hilarious
contemporary satirists (a list of two). Buckley's ``Little Green
Men'' pokes knowing fun at the worlds inside the Beltway and
outside the Milky Way.
</P>
<P>
   John Oliver Banion, all stuffed shirt, bad haircut and owlish
glasses, is a hugely successful talk-show host; any resemblance to
George Will is doubtless intentional. Banion lives the good life,
Washington-style. The book begins with him humiliating the
president in front of millions, then zipping off to a chichi brunch
stuffed to the gills with socialites and politicos, all of whom pay
homage to the man with the chutzpah and the pull to ridicule the
most powerful man in the world.
</P>
<P>
   Well, maybe not (begin itals) the (end itals) most powerful.
That title belongs to the leader of Majestic Twelve, or MJ-12, a
supersecret group that originally existed to make the Russians
think the United States had UFO technology (thus the infamous
Roswell, N.M., ``crash'').
</P>
<P>
   ``They decided that as long as they were at it,'' Buckley
writes, ``MJ-12 could serve another, even higher purpose: keeping
the taxpaying U.S. citizenry alarmed about the possibility of
invasion from outer space and therefore happy to fund expansion of
the military-aerospace complex. A country convinced that little
green men were hovering over the rooftops was inclined to vote yea
for big weapons and space programs.''
</P>
<P>
   That means staged sightings and then abductions, which means men
in alien suits probing people in uncomfortable places. The
abductions complicated things. (``For one thing, it meant finding
dwarfs with security clearances. For this reason, aliens have
gotten considerably bigger over the years.'')
</P>
<P>
   Of course, someone must decide who gets abducted. MJ-12 relies
on a ``credibility algorithm'' that tends toward overweight
Midwestern women.
</P>
<P>
   Enter Nathan Scrubbs, who works in Abductions. A few too many
Bloody Marys after his promotion is denied leads to the abduction
of one John O. Banion. Actually, it takes a couple of tries, but
Banion eventually is a true believer, one who turns his talk show
into a forum for fellow abductees, conspiracy theorists and mixed
nuts.
</P>
<P>
   Banion and Scrubbs eventually wind up working together after a
fashion to keep themselves out of trouble. The plot moves along
nicely enough, but the real beauty is in Buckley's skewering of
Washington and of UFO believers.
</P>
<P>
   The Washington crowd is filled with familiar faces. There is
Burt Galilee, for instance, in the role of Vernon Jordan.
``Everyone trusted Burton Galilee. Presidents, Supreme Court
justices trusted him. The notoriously tight-lipped chairman of the
Federal Reserve was even said to confide his lurid fears of
inflation to Burton Galilee. . . . He had a great talent: He made
White people feel good about themselves. They could honestly say,
`Me, prejudiced? Hell, one of my best friends is Burt Galilee.' ''
</P>
<P>
   Pop culture is represented by, among others, Tom Clancy. Buckley
and Clancy had a real-life feud a few years back. Perhaps that
accounts for Banion's retort when the technowriter goes off on a
military rant: ``Oh, don't play soldier with me. The only uniform
you ever wore was a Cub Scout outfit, with a merit badge for
pulling the legs off insects.''
</P>
<P>
   The UFO nuts don't come off much better. There is Bart Hupkin,
for instance, author of ``Plucked,'' who practices hypnotic
regression of abductees. ``True, some of the questions he put to
abductees once they were under might be considered leading, such as
`Were you abducted by four speckled, tentacled creatures from the
Planet Farble? Yes or maybe?' ''
</P>
<P>
   ``Little Green Men'' doesn't have the bite of ``Thank You for
Smoking,'' Buckley's fabulous sendup of Big Tobacco. It's more
good-natured in its pillories. Moreover, in government conspiracies
and UFOs, Buckley has chosen a couple of targets that ridicule
themselves so well it's sometimes hard for a satirist to outdo
them.
</P>
<P>
   But it's still funny, and the takedowns of self-important
Washington figures and customs are a laugh-out-loud riot. Unless
you don't think the idea of aliens probing George Will humorous. In
that case, maybe you've been abducted too. &QL;

<P>
   A survey of recently published books:
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &UR; THE NORTON BOOK OF AMERICAN AUTOBIOGRAPHY &QL; 
 &UR; Edited by Jay Parini (Norton, $32.50)
</P>
<P>
   You have to chuckle over a book that implies a direct line
between Benjamin Franklin and Mary Karr, but here it is: Parini
includes an excerpt from Franklin's autobiography (a classic in the
genre) in which Franklin discusses the moral virtues, and another
from Karr's ``The Liar's Club,'' the splendid but raucous tale of
her upbringing in eastern Texas, in which the moral virtues played
almost no role at all. Also here, chronologically, are selections
from Thoreau's ``Walden,'' Frederick Douglass' ``My Bondage and My
Freedom,'' Walt Whitman's ``Specimen Days in America,'' Mark
Twain's ``Life on the Mississippi,'' Henry James' ``Notes of a Son
and Brother,'' Booker T. Washington's ``Up from Slavery,'' Hellen
Keller's ``The Story of My Life,'' Eudora Welty's ``One Writer's
Beginnings, ''Wallace Stegner's ``Wolf Willow,'' Gay Talese's
``Unto the Sons,'' Harry Crews' ``A Childhood: The Biography of a
Place,'' Frank Conroy's ``Stop-Time,'' Maxine Hong Kingston's ``The
Woman Warrior,'' Paul Monette's ``Borrowed Time: An AIDS Memoir,''
Annie Dillard's ``An American Childhood,'' Luis Rodriguez's
``Always Running,'' Terry Tempest Williams' ``Refuge,'' Sherman
Alexie's ``First Indian on the Moon'' and many more. Parini calls
autobiography ``the essential American genre, a form of writing
closely allied to our national self-consciousness.'' He has done a
superb job of choosing his material, although he admits that the
original manuscript of this book was three times its current size,
and that the cutting seemed arbitrary. There is a short preface by
Gore Vidal, who reminds us of the words of French writer Jules
Renard: ``I find that when I do not think of myself, I do not think
at all.'' &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &UR; WIT &QL; 
 &UR; Margaret Edson (Faber and Faber, $12)
</P>
<P>
   Vivian Bearing is 50, a tough, demanding professor of
17th-century poetry specializing in the Holy Sonnets of John Donne,
which, she reminds us, ``explore mortality in greater depth than
any other body of work in the English language.'' Her specialty,
then, is well-chosen, because Vivian is also a woman with cancer _
advanced metastatic ovarian cancer _ and she is about to embark on
a brutal form of experimental drug treatment that will wreak havoc
with her body. But her wit _ what of that? For Vivian's
intelligence is formidable, inquisitive, indeed nearly invincible.
Could this cancer be a match for it? Of course not, but be advised:
This is no warm and fuzzy play, any more than Vivian is a
sentimental heroine. She is challenging, thought-provoking and,
ultimately, living proof that Death shall be no more. Margaret
Edson is an Atlanta kindergarten teacher who won a Pulitzer Prize
for this, her first play, earlier this week. &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &UR; WATER, EARTH AND SKY: THE COLORADO RIVER BASIN &QL; 
 &UR; Michael Collier (University of Utah, $29.95)
</P>
<P>
   Collier, a writer, geologist and physician who practices in
Flagstaff, is also a flier _ he takes photographs from the air in
his 1955 Cessna, which offers views of the landscape that are both
otherworldly and delightfully familiar. There is a serenity to the
airborne images, in their patterns and colors, and in the implied
silence that seems to surround them. Here Collier follows the
features of the Colorado River system, top to bottom, Wyoming to
Mexico, as viewed from the sky. We see its lazy meanderings through
a lush, green valley in Colorado (but only because of upstream
diversions _ left full strength, the river would have kept its
channel scoured), its course through rocky canyonlands in Utah, the
dams that control and divert it, its muddy journey through the
Grand Canyon and, eventually, its dry bed as it enters Mexico.
Collier's photographs are loyal to their subject (unlike books for
the tourist trade, this one does not imply that every rock and
canyon is fluorescent orange), and they are not blown into
poster-size extravagance. They are supported instead by essays from
Collier and six other naturalists, researchers and ecologists who
explore the natural and human history of the Colorado River. The
result is an elegant lesson on how natural processes and human
impact have affected one of the most beautiful rivers in the
world. &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &UR; ON THE BUS WITH ROSA PARKS &QL; 
 &UR; Rita Dove (Norton, $21)
</P>
<P>
   ``How she sat there,/ the time right inside a place/ so wrong it
was ready./ That trim name with/ its dream of a bench/ to rest on.
Her sensible coat./ Doing nothing was the doing:/ the clean flame
of her gaze/ carved by a camera flash./ How she stood up/ when they
bent down to retrieve/ her purse. That courtesy.'' This, in its
entirety is ``Rosa,'' from the new collection of poetry by the
nation's former poet laureate and winner of a Pulitzer Prize. Read
``The Camel Comes to Us from the Barbarians'' (inspired by an Aesop
fable) about an ugly, difficult animal that will not bow to its
keepers _ ``A rare commodity, these beasts _/ who cannot know/ what
beauty wreaks, what mountains/ pity moves.'' Or ``There Came a
Soul,'' inspired by Chicago artist Ivan Albright's 1929 painting of
20-year-old Ida Rogers, in which he portrayed her as a lonely old
woman. Or ``Claudette Colvin Goes to Work,'' inspired by a
15-year-old Black high school student who refused to yield her bus
seat to White students a full nine months before Rosa Parks was
arrested in 1955. Dove's poems are thick with sensual details, the
hint of broader stories, the gravity of history. She is a member of
the faculty at the University of Virginia. &QL;

 &HT;    Beloved `Annie' misses mark but provides pleasures
 &HT;    By Kathy Janich
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   No matter how you twist it, turn it or shuffle its parts, Irving
Berlin's score for ``Annie Get Your Gun'' is a classic. Still,
there's no bull's-eye here. Like the gun sight Annie skews to win
Frank's heart, this ``rebirthing'' of the '46 chestnut just misses
its mark. So, like Annie Oakley and Frank Butler aiming at clay
pigeons, let's tally the hits and misses:
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Star Bernadette Peters (anything she can do, no one does
better) as Annie. Hit! The manly Tom Wopat as Frank. Hit!
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Opening with ``There's No Business Like Show Business.'' Miss!
Tomahawking two numbers to do s2nP,Ugh.) Miss!
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Nineteen tracks. Hit! Six reprises. Miss!
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  A de-emphasized chorus. A tuneful ``Old-Fashioned Wedding.'' A
slow and ghastly ``I Got the Sun in the Morning.'' Miss! Hit! Miss!
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  A truncated ``You Can't Get a Man With a Gun.'' Miss!
</P>
<P>
   You get the idea. This is certainly a disc that show music fans
and Peters' fans will want. Unfortunately, it's more wooden Indian
than the genuine article.

   ``Tonight''
</P>
<P>
   Silk. Elektra. 17 tracks.
</P>
<P>
   Grade: B-
</P>
<P>
   It sounds like the sales drop between Silk's first and second
album has made the group revert to its sensual beginnings on its
third. The Atlanta quintet hit the multimillion mark when it
released the single ``Freak Me'' from its 1992 debut and its 1995
follow-up _ an underappreciated topical and vocal stretch _ sold a
respectable 500,000 copies, but was perceived as a disappointment.
So ``Tonight'' is almost singularly focused on the bedroom again:
``Let's Make Love,'' ``Meeting in My Bedroom,'' ``Sexcellent'' _
all varied ways of suggesting the same thing. The bad thing is when
the lushly-produced suggestions come wrapped in worn cliches like
``be there or be square'' and ``you're jiggy.'' These incredibly
gifted singers could have a difficult time luring patient
listeners, much less sexual partners.

   ``The Unauthorized Biography of Reinhold Messner''
</P>
<P>
   Ben Folds Five. Sony/550 Music. 11 tracks.
</P>
<P>
   Grade: B
</P>
<P>
   Fans of North Carolina piano man Ben Folds' heretofore wacky pop
ditties, including the 1995 hit ``Underground,'' are going to be
flummoxed by this arty, downbeat release. Ostensibly a concept
album, ``Messner's'' 11 loosely-connected tracks paint a portrait
of a weary soul trying to come to terms with a life gone awry. The
twice-divorced Folds wraps laments on the loss of love and faith in
grandiose arrangements _ the epic ballad ``Narcolepsy'' sounds like
Styx crossed with ``Night and Day''-era Joe Jackson. Not until the
sixth track, ``Army,'' does Folds indulge his wise-cracking side,
riffing on the universal adolescent dilemma of choosing a career.
It's a welcome change-up in this relentlessly sad, often beautiful
work.

   ``Anima Animus''
</P>
<P>
   The Creatures. Instinct. 10 tracks.
</P>
<P>
   Grade: B
</P>
<P>
   Former Siouxsie and the Banshees linchpins Siouxsie Sioux and
Budgie are the Creatures. They've been exploring edgier realms of
music in this guise since their days in their former band. Sioux's
voice has matured into an impressive instrument over the course of
her 20-plus year career, and her partner has always been a great
percussionist. In fact, the Creatures' work is Budgie's chance to
display his considerable skill on a battery of instruments.
Sequenced synthesizers, marimbas and Sioux's voice dominate the
mix, as the drums lay down an often danceable beat. It's a pretty
dark ride, though, because just like the Banshees, the Creatures'
music always sounds vaguely sinister.

 &HT;    Insect insurrection full of visual effects
 &HT;    By Steve Murray
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ``A Bug's Life'' (G)
</P>
<P>
   A multi-legged wonder. This computer-animated feature from the
makers of ``Toy Story'' is the eye-popping, witty tale of an ant
named Flik (voice of Dave Foley), who recruits a bunch of circus
bugs to battle evil grasshoppers (the chief villain is voiced by
Kevin Spacey).
</P>
<P>
   The catch is, the big-top critters think they've been hired to
perform, not fight, which leads to a ton of amusing show biz jokes.
</P>
<P>
   The movie's also bursting with extraordinary visual grace notes:
Forests of clover. A dandelion tuft used as a parachute. A rowdy
grasshopper cantina hidden under a sombrero. The flea circus alone
is an eye-filling accumulation of found objects, including a dog
collar used as the main performance ring and a Chinese takeout
carton filling in as a magician's cabinet.
</P>
<P>
   There's enough going on here to keep every adult, child or
arachnid vastly entertained. Priced to buy: $26.99 for the VHS
tape, or $34.99 on DVD.

 &HT;    By Steve Murray, Jill Vejnoska and Eleanor Ringel Gillespie
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   &QR;  ``The Siege'' (R) _ Which would be worse, a series of
terrorist bombings of New York or the martial-law takeover by the
Army as a response? Denzel Washington, Annette Bening and Bruce
Willis star in a fast-moving, well-made paranoia thriller that
ultimately reduces a hot-button topic to a standard Hollywood
action cliche.
</P>
<P>
   Grade: B-
</P>
<P>
   _ Steve Murray
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  ``A Night at the Roxbury'' (PG-13) _ Those head-bopping,
nightclubbing brothers from ``Saturday Night Live'' (Chris Kattan,
far left, and Will Farrell) are out in a full-fledged story. Well,
as full-fledged as you can get when your central characters are a
couple of clueless, would-be coolsters whose dream is getting into,
and then owning, the hottest club in town. Lots of groaningly funny
lines and a surprisingly coherent story line make this a fun,
thankfully concise viewing experience. Grade: B
</P>
<P>
   _Jill Vejnoska
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  ``Monument Avenue'' (unrated) _ An Irish variation on ``Mean
Streets,'' this is a bleak, gritty look at some pals in a
blue-collar section of Boston whose ties to each other and to the
old neighborhood are strangling them. They spend their time
drinking, snorting coke, stealing cars and adhering to false
notions of honor and loyalty. Colm Meaney and Denis Leary provide
standout performances. Grade: B+
</P>
<P>
   _Eleanor Ringel Gillespie
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  ``Simon Birch'' (PG) _ A little movie with big problems. In
the early 1960s, a preadolescent dwarf named Simon Birch (Ian
Michael Smith) is convinced he will one day be a hero, while his
best pal (Joseph Mazzello) tries to solve the mystery of his real
father (Ashley Judd is Mazzello's closemouthed mother). The movie
is clearly a labor of love; alas, it's also a labor to sit through.

 &HT;    Other opportunities to love the Bard
 &HT;    By Eleanor Ringel Gillespie
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   His labors were never lost.
</P>
<P>
   William Shakespeare would've been 435 years old Friday. The
renewed interest in his work, sparked by ``Shakespeare in Love's''
Oscarthon, must feel like a fitting and long-overdue birthday
present. Geoffrey Rush recalls that while they were filming
``Shakespeare,'' the cast used to come up with other titles (``The
Full Monologue,'' ``You've Got Mercutio'') to make it sound more
audience friendly.
</P>
<P>
   But lately the S-word has been a box-office boon. He's been
teened in movies like ``10 Things I Hate About You'' and given the
Big Star treatment in the more traditional ``A Midsummer Night's
Dream,'' starring Michelle Pfeiffer and Calista Flockhart (it opens
in early May). Still to come are a high-tech ``Titus Andronicus''
with Jessica Lange and Anthony Hopkins and a musical ``Love's
Labour's Lost,'' directed by Kenneth Branagh and starring Alicia
Silverstone and Nathan Lane.
</P>
<P>
   When it comes to good Will hunting on video, most of us know to
go to the sections labeled Olivier, Branagh or Welles. However,
you'd be surprised who's tackled iambic pentameter. Mel Gibson
(``Hamlet''), Leonardo DiCaprio (``William Shakespeare's Romeo +
Juliet''), Richard Burton and Elizabeth Taylor (``The Taming of the
Shrew.'')
</P>
<P>
   But let's get really obscure. Here are some Shakespeares on film
from some pretty unexpected sources.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  ``Macbeth'' (1971).
</P>
<P>
   Roman Polanski _ yes, that Polanski, of ``Rosemary's Baby,''
``Chinatown'' and the Charles Manson murders _ directed his version
of Shakespeare's cursed play (superstitious actors always call it
``the Scottish play'') as a tale of ambition, cruelty, pagan ritual
and more slaughter than poetry.
</P>
<P>
   Macbeth is played by Jon Finch; his Lady is Francesca Annis, who
does the sleepwalking scene in the nude (Hugh Hefner produced).
Polanski had hoped that the Shakespeare imprimatur would keep the
critics from making links to the horrors of the Manson massacre
(Polanski's pregant wife, Sharon Tate, was among the victims). Of
course, if that was the idea, why didn't he direct something like
``As You Like It'' or ``Much Ado About Nothing?''
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  ``King Lear'' (1970).
</P>
<P>
   Stage director Peter Brook filmed this intensely bleak and
chilly ``Lear'' on location in Denmark. Essentially, it's a
cinematic adaptation of a highly acclaimed stage version he'd done
with the same cast a few years earlier.
</P>
<P>
   It is definitely not for those who barely made it through the
Olivier TV version. It is difficult and opaque and, in its attempt
to link ``Lear'' to the emptiness of Samuel Beckett's work, a
stunning and challenging piece. What any viewer will savor,
however, is the superb British cast, led by Paul Scofield in the
title role. A few years earlier Scofield had won an Oscar playing
Sir Thomas More in the popular historical morality movie ``A Man
for All Seasons.''
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  ``Richard III'' (1995).
</P>
<P>
   You probably know him now from ``Gods and Monsters,'' but Ian
McKellen gave his first Oscar-worthy performance of the decade
(though he was not nominated) as humpbacked Richard of Gloucestor.
</P>
<P>
   Manipulating his way through a throng of throne-hungry, unruly
royals, he murders friend, foe and family alike in order to get his
hands on the crown. The setting has been changed to England in the
1930s and McKellen makes a magnificently media-savy monster, as
unctuous as he is unrepentant.
</P>
<P>
   The impeccable supporting cast ranges from some stalwart Brits
to Hollywood faces like Annette Bening and Robert Downey Jr., both
of whom more than hold their own in such distinguished company.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  ``A Midsummer Night's Dream'' (1935).
</P>
<P>
   German theatre director Max Reinhardt (assisted by William
Dieterle) pulled out all the stops for this sumptuous studio
production of Shakespeare's comedy. Dick Powell, Joe E. Brown,
Olivia de Havilland and Anita Louise are among the name players,
but top-billed is James Cagney as Bottom, the weaver who ends up
with an ass's head.
</P>
<P>
   Cagney later recalled that Reinhardt cast him after seeing him
in something called ``Lady Killer'' (go figure). Mickey Rooney is
unexpectedly wonderful as Puck.
</P>
<P>
   Behind-the-scenes note: Halfway through production Rooney broke
his leg skiing and the rest of his scenes were shot from the waist
up (with a double for the long shots).

FOR FATHER, A FRIGHTFUL FLIGHT TO COLORADO 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By MICHAEL DOUGAN  
 c.1999 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LITTLETON, Colo. _ Don Jugert was on the tail end of a
three-week business trip in Oregon when the store manager said:
``You're from Denver? Did you hear what happened?''
</P>
<P>
   Jugert rushed to a radio and listened with horror as the
announcers detailed the carnage at suburban Columbine High School _
the school his daughters attend.
</P>
<P>
   Twenty-five dead, according to the early reports Tuesday. (The
police said Wednesday that 15 children and adults died in the
Tuesday shooting.) Did that grim figure include Angela, 16, a
junior, or Valerie, 15, a freshman?
</P>
<P>
   Jugert, a 44-year-old division manager for Napa Auto Parts, took
a plane to San Francisco to catch a connecting flight to Denver. On
his way to San Francisco, Jugert had no way of knowing what had
happened to his daughters. ``I tried calling my wife, but all the
lines were busy,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   During the flight, Jugert entertained what he later called
``weird thoughts.''
</P>
<P>
   He recalled a Saturday, two weeks ago, when he drove Valerie to
the school to see if her name was on the freshly posted list of new
cheerleaders. She had tried out before and failed to make the cut.
</P>
<P>
   Jugert sat in the car and shot video of his daughter as she
walked hesitantly to the posting and then shrieked with delight at
what she saw. He remembered how, as they drove home that day, she
said, ``Dad, this is the best weekend of my life.''
</P>
<P>
   On the flight, he thought about Charlton Heston, his former
big-screen idol, now head of the National Rifle Association and a
spokesman for the right to bear arms. Jugert was an NRA member at
one time. He turned in his membership card several years ago
because he didn't like the organization's politics.
</P>
<P>
   ``I used to love Charlton Heston,'' he said. ``But I'm always
going to have that sick feeling now when I watch him. `The Ten
Commandments' used to be one of my favorite movies.''
</P>
<P>
   Jugert landed at San Francisco International Airport and rushed
to a phone kiosk. He called his father in Denver. He called his
wife, Char, in Littleton. Finally, he got the words he wanted.
</P>
<P>
   Both daughters were alive and unharmed. He wanted to hug them.
</P>
<P>
   He boarded United Flight 1286, departing at 9:15 p.m. for
Denver.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm just glad Valerie didn't have her cheerleader uniform
on,'' he said after takeoff. ``I know they would have targeted the
cheerleaders.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS.) &QL; 
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Valerie knew the group of students the suspected gunmen belonged
to _ the so-called Trench Coat Mafia. She ``just hated those
people,'' Jugert said.
</P>
<P>
   He said Valerie had been on the school's commons when the shots
rang out from nearby.
</P>
<P>
   ``They all thought it was a senior prank,'' Jugert said. Like
last week, when the seniors glued all the school doors shut. Or the
time they threw water balloons at the freshmen during assembly.
</P>
<P>
   ``Then a teacher told her to get down,'' Jugert said. That
teacher was shot twice in the back, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Angela ran from the school library. It was there that
the gunman continued their rampage minutes later.
</P>
<P>
   At home, Char Jugert received a call from a friend in Atlanta
who had learned about the shooting on the news. That was Char's
first word of it. She tried to drive to the school, but couldn't
get close.
</P>
<P>
   It would be four hours before she learned that her daughters
were unharmed.
</P>
<P>
   ``My daughters . . . were looking for each other,'' Don Jugert
said. At first, though, each girl fled from the school and took
refuge in separate houses in the neighborhood, as instructed by the
authorities at the scene.
</P>
<P>
   When Valerie and her mother finally were reunited, the freshman
kept insisting that the FBI let her return to the school to get her
backpack ``because she was going to ballet,'' Don Jugert said.
</P>
<P>
   By the time she got home, her dad said, Valerie wasn't in the
mood to dance.

   OUT _ In Racine, Wis., last year, police arrested five boys who
allegedly had threatened to take over the school and kill a bunch
of students and teachers. As it turned out, the boys had no
weapons, and some people criticized authorities for going
overboard. A day after the Colorado shootings, though, it looks
like the folks in Wisconsin were on to something. We'll look at
aggressive intervention and whether it works. How far can
authorities go in intervening before they start treading on
students' civil rights? Can you predict what teen-agers will do? At
least one expert says many young people act weird and make threats
but just a tiny percentage actually will carry them out. Is it
worth trying to identify outcasts? We talk with law enforcement

NATO PARTY TRANSFORMS INTO A WAR COUNCIL 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (w and i coding)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MARY LEONARD  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ NATO's 50th birthday party has a lot of people
singing the blues.
</P>
<P>
   Starting at the top, Secretary of State Madeleine K. Albright
and national security adviser Samuel Berger in somber tones Tuesday
recast the celebration scheduled long ago for this weekend in
Washington as a nothing-but-work war summit over NATO's deepening
crisis in Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   Further down the White House command chain, Richard Socarites,
the official in charge of three days of luncheons, dinners,
meetings, press conferences, and making the motorcades of no fewer
than 44 world leaders run on time, laments that ``as a social
event, this summit is turning out as a bust.''
</P>
<P>
   Forty-two law enforcement agencies in the Washington area face
an unprecendented security assignment that was stressful to begin
with and only got worse when NATO started bombing Yugoslavia.
``We're prepared for anything,'' said Kenneth Piernick, an FBI
counterterrorism specialist, ``from simple assaults to weapons of
mass destruction.''
</P>
<P>
   And as for Washington tourists, here by the tens of thousands at
the height of the spring-vacation season, the red carpet rolling
out for NATO VIPs means a long weekend of frustration: airport
delays, traffic gridlock, closed museums, no White House tours, and
six square blocks of the capital cordoned off from anybody without
a special pass.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're going to hate me,'' said Karina Ferguson, a tour guide
anticipating the reaction of visitors when she tells them, come
Friday, it's Mount Vernon, George Washington's home in northern
Virginia, or nothing.
</P>
<P>
   Nobody is underestimating the significance of this NATO summit.
What could have been a predictable weekend of windy speeches,
self-congratulation, splendid parties, and an effusive welcome to
NATO's three newest members, Hungary, Poland, and the Czech
Republic, has suddenly switched to a strategic war council on
Kosovo that will test the alliance's mettle.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had planned a summit that focused a bit on the past and a
great deal on the future . . . but now it is necessary to have it
and to focus intensely on the present as well,'' Berger said at a
White House briefing Tuesday. ``Now this is going to be a working
meeting of a military alliance in the middle of a conflict.''
</P>
<P>
   The logistics of the summit were already daunting: How to greet,
move, protect, lodge, and entertain the heads of state, prime
ministers, and hundreds of other foreign dignitaries from 19 NATO
countries and as many as 25 NATO-affiliated nations. Consider, for
example, that diplomatic protocol demands the NATO leaders arrive
in alphabetical order (by country, English spelling) at a White
House dinner for 800 on Saturday night.
</P>
<P>
   Now, at the last minute, NATO officials have ripped up the
program and are improvising. The opening ceremony Friday morning
has been replaced by a three-hour meeting on Kosovo. A military
parade has been canceled, and an emergency session on humanitarian
aid may be held Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   A commemoration will take place Friday in the same Constitution
Avenue auditorium where the North Atlantic Treaty was signed 50
years ago, but NATO has nixed a warplane flyover as inappropriate.
</P>
<P>
   With images of bleak, Balkan refugee camps fresh on TV screens,
NATO also scratched black-tie events and anything not fitting a
theme of ``simple, serious, and dignified,'' said Socarides, a
special assistant to President Clinton and the summit's chief
operating officer. ``More work, less pomp and circumstance.''
</P>
<P>
   That's not to say socializing has been eliminated entirely. In
addition to the White House dinner in a tent on the South Lawn, the
president and Mrs. Clinton will greet guests at a more exclusive
party Friday evening, and Mrs. Clinton will host two luncheons for
VIP spouses. The cost of the summit, shared by the US government
and corporate sponsors, will be about $25 million.
</P>
<P>
   As Washington events go, the size of this summit is small with
about 5,000 attendees, including 3,000 journalists. (The Federation
of American Societies for Experimental Biology brought more than
11,000 conventioneers to the capital this week.) But in scale _ in
catering and floral arrangements, in fleets of limousines required,
in mobile phones in use, and certainly in security _ this is the
mother of all Washington weekends.
</P>
<P>
   The Secret Service is in charge of security, and it is leaving
no manhole or mailbox unsealed, no rooftop unguarded, no airspace
unpatrolled, no biological threat unchecked. To control the summit
area, the Secret Service is restricting the six square blocks
around Federal Triangle to NATO traffic only, and it has required
nine of the Smithsonian museums to close Friday.
</P>
<P>
   The District of Columbia will shut down its government and
public schools Friday, and 90,000 federal bureaucrats will get that
day off too, with pay.
</P>
<P>
   ``You have to assume there is a very high threat level,'' said
Chuck Vance, a Secret Service veteran who now runs a private
security firm in Washington.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have lived here 19 years, through some huge events on the
Mall and several presidential inaugurations, but I don't recall
anything like this,'' said Marie Tibor, vice president of the
Washington Convention and Visitor Association. ``If a rolling
motorcade excites you, this is the time to be here. For anyone
else, it presents a true challenge.''

   Sometimes writers don't have healthy boundaries. And sometimes
they start taking on the attributes of their subjects. So let's
just be thankful that Tom Junod was not writing a piece on Roberto
Benigni for the May issue of Esquire, whose cover features a
close-up of David Duchovny looking rather stuck. With his trademark
adventurousness, Junod composes a full-length profile of
11-year-old rapper Bow Wow and his producer, Jermaine Dupri, in rap
style _ rhyming couplets, if you prefer. ``Now for all y'all who
don't know who Jermaine is _ / well, you ain't dead yet, just on
intravenous, / and we'll call the doctor, and instead of sutures, /
we'll ask him to give you a glimpse of the future. / 'Cause just
like his rival, Sean Combs (aka `Puffy'), / Jermaine's shaping the
mind of your sweet daughter, Muffy.'' The ambitious rap narrative
couldn't have been easy to write, but it's hard to take for six
pages, and too self-conscious to capture the drama of Jermaine's
play for the puppy soul of Bow Wow, whose real name _ Shad Moss _
was changed by Snoop Dogg. It's an invention that goes to lengths
too dire to bring the rap world to the men of Esquire.
</P>
<P>
   The Duchovny piece is a classic meta-interview, with the
monotoned ``X-Files'' actor sharing plenty about why he doesn't
like sharing his personal life with strangers. His feelings on
public revelation range from the vague _ ``I always find it
objectionable'' _ to the insecure, as he explains that doing
promotion means his work is not strong enough to attract viewers on
its own. His theories about America's love-hate relationship with
fame range from the simplistic _ ``I always feel, when somebody
calls you a star, it's like they're saying fag'' _ to the
elaborate, including his notion that people have controling and
envious feelings toward celebrities because they think of them as
children: ``For hundreds of years . . . the grownups sat around and
watched the kids play. Now they sit around and watch television.''
The talking-about-not-talking approach is a fitting one for
Duchovny, whose ``X-Files'' acting often depends on trust-no-one
reticence.
</P>
<P>
   By the way, Duchovny has also inspired loose couplets, but the
rhyming lines about the much-drooled-over star are Internet odes to
the bathing suit he wore in an ``X-Files'' episode. One goes,
``Little red Speedo, so privileged is it / Upon those fine buns, it
proudly does sit.''

   Last year it was Courtney Love and Billy Corgan and Marilyn
Manson, and this year it's Bender, the robot who's got issues. For
some reason, rock magazine Spin for May gives a giant plug to
``Simpsons'' creator Matt Groening's new animated series,
``Futurama,'' by featuring the show on its cover. I guess
``Futurama'' has some hidden alternative credibility, but the
hoo-ha does seem a bit premature, as the month-old show, set in the
year 3000, is still very much in the ``promising'' phase.

   The fat New Yorker for April 26 and May 3 is ``The Money
Issue,'' featuring a surprisingly confessional piece by Daphne
Merkin about how growing up wealthy has affected her. Merkin also
talks about the taboo that keeps the subject of money ``in the
closet,'' and how ``you are more likely to get a woman to confess
that she has committed incest with her father than to disclose what
her father earns, or whether she's being subsidized by any of his
money.'' Another confessional piece, by Arthur Krystal, looks at
laziness, which ``just is. It's like being freckled or
color-blind.'' He admits that ``I liked everything about money
except the prospect of buckling down and making it. . . . The
thought of being bound and defined by work that didn't interest me
sent shivers down my spine.''

NUMBER OF MISSING KOSOVARS CHALLENGED 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By CHARLES A. RADIN AND LOUISE D. PALMER GLOBE CORRESONDENT  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Experts in surveillance photography, wartime
propaganda, and Balkan diplomacy say there is every reason to
believe that atrocities are being committed against the ethnic
Albanian majority in strife-torn Kosovo, but little reason at this
time to accept reports of huge numbers of dead and missing Kosovars
that are being bandied about.
</P>
<P>
   The US State Department said Monday that a half million ethnic
Albanian men are unaccounted for in the disputed province, which is
part of Serb-dominated Yugoslavia but 90 percent Albanian, and a
department spokesman hinted that 100,000 may have met with foul
play. The statements have stoked public outrage, but they are based
on no publicly available documents or photographs.
</P>
<P>
   ``In all these cases, the first numbers we hear are
overestimates,'' said Farouk El-Baz, a pioneer in photography from
space who directs Boston University's Center for Remote Sensing.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am surprised we are not seeing more of what is on the
ground. There must be more'' that US officials could show, El-Baz
added. ``Sensing equipment is now at a state that should make these
things more obvious and more certain.''
</P>
<P>
   In the 28 days since NATO began bombing Yugoslavia in what was
portrayed as an effort to stop attacks on and expulsions of Kosovar
Albanians, several instances of misinformation have sparked
questioning of the information being released by alliance and US
officials.
</P>
<P>
   --After Yugoslavia charged that a refugee convoy had been
bombarded by NATO jets, US General Wesley Clark, the supreme
commander of NATO, spun the story around, blaming Yugoslav forces
for an attack that killed dozens of civilians. Clark then retracted
the statement, and NATO took responsibility for hitting civilians.
</P>
<P>
   In the same incident, the Pentagon released a taped interview
with an American pilot purportedly involved in the bombing, but it
turned out that the pilot was describing a different mission.
</P>
<P>
   --NATO and the State Department have repeatedly said that they
had evidence that members of the Albanian intelligentsia were being
executed. While some of those named were indeed killed, others
turned up alive. Among them was Baton Haxhiu, who reportedly heard
himself pronounced dead by NATO officials in Brussels. Haxhiu, the
editor of the independent ethnic Albanian paper, Koha Ditore, was
alive and in hiding.
</P>
<P>
   --US and NATO officials have repeatedly asserted they had
evidence that Yugoslav forces are committing crimes against
humanity and committing mass genocide. This week, they said, these
forces had dug mass graves pointing in the direction of Mecca,
using a satellite photo to underscore their point.
</P>
<P>
   ``Long neat rows of individual graves, 150 very neatly dug
graves _ these are not mass graves,'' said MIT political science
professor Barry Posen, a specialist in the history of warfare.
``It's weird to think they would have a mass murder, recruit grave
diggers, and properly orient the graves toward Mecca so as to give
them some semblance of a proper Muslim burial.''
</P>
<P>
   Posen said hunger for news has led to nearly unquestioning
acceptance of official statements and superficial appearances by
the Western media, allowing the politicians and generals leading
the air campaign to use the refugees to justify the bombing.
</P>
<P>
   ``Because the press has not gone back to investigate and dispell
`facts' that were staked out at the beginning that said there were
already hundreds of thousands of refugees,'' Posen said, ``NATO is
able to absolve itself and make great use of very tragic pictures
of people in very tragic circumstances to say, `See, this is why we
fought the war, to reverse this.' ''
</P>
<P>
   Nongovernmental specialists and analysts contacted about the
various NATO claims uniformly said they believe atrocities are
occurring, and stressed that they do not want to be interpreted as
defending or excusing these acts.
</P>
<P>
   But, said Robert Hayden, director of the University of
Pittsburgh's Center for Russian and East European Studies, the
State Department reports of 100,000 to 500,000 unaccounted-for
Albanian men ``are ludicrous _ the story is just ludicrous.
</P>
<P>
   ``NATO is running a propaganda campaign, there's no question
about that,'' Hayden said. ``There have been lots of discrepancies
in the official story, but what is interesting is that, until now,
there has been amazingly little scrutiny of that story.''
</P>
<P>
   However, there are other explanations other than propaganda
campaigning for NATO and the United States to hold back on
high-altitude or space photos that could document the location of
dead and missing Kosovars.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you show a picture, any good expert will know that this
photo must have been taken by a certain type of platform, and that
the camera characteristics are 1, 2, 3, 4,'' El-Baz said.
``Governments do not want to tell the general public what the
detailed capabilities of the sensing equipment are. And if you show
the photo, an expert can make something like it, or try to evade
it.''
</P>
<P>
   Swanee Hunt, who was US ambassador to Austria in the mid-1990s
while the former Yugoslavian republic of Bosnia was the focus of
ethnic wars, said she was looking at pictures of men lined up to be
executed and piled into mass graves long before the photos were
ever released publicly.
</P>
<P>
   ``The means we have of gathering information are very
sophisticated. They are extraordinarily detailed,'' said Hunt, who
runs a public policy program at Harvard's Kennedy School of
Government. ``But the intelligence community is very sensitive
about their methods . . . maybe not because the Serbs are watching,
maybe because the Chinese are.''

VOLUNTEER WORK AT WORK 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DIANE E. LEWIS  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   With a tight labor market forcing large and small companies to
find new ways to attract and keep good employees, volunteering is
fast becoming a corporate trend and recruiting tool.
</P>
<P>
   The reasoning behind the push: Volunteerism not only promotes a
company's image, but also attracts skilled people in a competitive
market.
</P>
<P>
   ``The best and the brightest are often those who are involved in
community service,'' says Edmund Burke, founder of Boston College's
Center for Corporate Community Relations and a believer.
</P>
<P>
   At Fleet Bank, 3,000 employees will roll up their sleeves for
National Volunteer Week and spruce up a gym, read to children,
landscape a shelter's grounds, sort clothes, or serve meals at a
Boston shelter for women.
</P>
<P>
   At Warner Bros. in Burbank, Calif., employees routinely scan a
menu of volunteer projects before registering their choices with
the company's volunteer coordinator.
</P>
<P>
   At Time Warner in New York, workers receive a monthly bulletin
of volunteer opportunities. One popular offering: Time To Read, an
on-going program that pairs 4,200 tutors with more than 16,000 kids
at 300 company sites.
</P>
<P>
   Then, there's the nonprofit New York Cares. It designs volunteer
opportunities for busy professionals who long for ``the flexibility
to volunteer without the long-term commitment,'' says spokeswoman
Susan Schnall. ``A lot of young professionals travel, work long
hours, and really can't give more than a few hours a week.''
</P>
<P>
   But should charity really begin at work?
</P>
<P>
   The California-based Ayn Rand Institute says it shouldn't. The
group has launched a campaign against corporate volunteerism and,
specifically, the reasoning behind it. Named after writer Ayn Rand,
author of ``The Fountainhead,'' the institute maintains that all
relationships are based on whether there are mutual benefits to the
parties.
</P>
<P>
   ``The problem with (corporate) volunteerism . . . is managers
are now being encouraged to volunteer,'' said spokesman Chris
Wolski. ``In some cases, it is part of upper management's goals . .
. We're against that. It means people are being seen as part of a
collective greater good rather than individuals. It also means they
may be asked to do things they might not do otherwise.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, volunteerism appears to have struck a chord in the
nation's executive suites. The Points of Light Foundation reports
that 1,500 companies are now members of volunteer councils, up from
just 600 in 1985. Meanwhile, workplace specialists are attributing
the surge to the labor shortage, increased competition, and a more
critical, and discerning, consumer.
</P>
<P>
   ``It promotes a company's image,'' says Michael Stevenson, a
spokesman for the BC center. ``A company like Timberland, for
example, becomes recognized for community involvement, and it may
even gain sales that way.''
</P>
<P>
   Burke, author of ``Corporate Community Relations: The Principle
of the Neighbor of Choice,'' says public expectations have forced
companies to take a closer look at their relationship with their
``neighbors.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It is no longer enough for a company to produce a decent
product,'' he says. ``A company must also demonstrate its concern
for the environment, and to the communities where it is based.
People expect them to be more responsible.''
</P>
<P>
   At a time when many working people barely have enough time for
community service, employees say they are attracted to a menu of
volunteer choices many big employers offer. It allows them to
select an activity without worrying about finding the time.
</P>
<P>
   At Fleet, some 3,000 members of its companywide volunteer army
known as TeamFleet will don blue T-shirts with the program's
insignia before volunteering at 110 different nonprofit agencies in
New England, New York, Milwaukee, Pennsylvania, Colorado, and South
Carolina _ wherever the bank has operations or affiliates, says
Melissa MacDonnell, a Fleet vice president who launched the program
in 1992.
</P>
<P>
   Other employee volunteers may opt to take two paid days off
during the year to assist the needy.
</P>
<P>
   One year, Lisa Joyner, a 33-year-old community development
officer at the bank, painted a barn at Boston's Franklin Park Zoo.
Another year she worked at a day-care center. And although they
were mostly one-time projects, Joyner insists that her contribution
was priceless to her; her impact, considerable.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've gone to elderly socials, assisted the homeless,
participated in clothing drives, and tutored children,'' says
Joyner, who involves her children in her volunteer activities.
``They were all wonderful experiences, a chance to give back.''
</P>
<P>
   After donating her time over two years to the Horizons
Initiative, a Dorchester day-care center for the children of
homeless women, executive assistant Diane McKinley was commended
for spending more hours on volunteer activities than any other
TeamFleet member. The company also contributed $10,000 to Horizons
in her name.
</P>
<P>
   While supporters hail corporate volunteerism, some workplace
advocates worry that employees who do not volunteer may be viewed
as having little or no management potential, or could miss out on
lucrative bonuses and perks.
</P>
<P>
   A 1997 survey by the BC center found that 85 percent of 227
corporate relations professionals had encouraged managers at their
companies to volunteer. Twenty-three percent required that managers
volunteer, and 17 percent said community involvement was an
important criteria in evaluating overall performance.
</P>
<P>
   IBM, for example, has included community involvement and
volunteerism among its objectives or goals for a select group of
senior executives. Among the goals: serving on nonprofit boards,
encouraging employees to volunteer, and participating in the
company's employee charitable campaign. Community involvement also
is part of the executives' bonus structure.
</P>
<P>
   What happens if a senior executive chooses not to volunteer?
</P>
<P>
   ``Obviously, community service is not the only measure of
evaluating a person's performance,'' said Stanley S. Litow, vice
president of corporate community relations at IBM in Armonk, N.Y.
He says IBM last year contributed $22 million through its employee
charitable campaign. IBM also contributes $1,500 to the charity of
the employee's choice for any volunteer who contributes more than
100 hours of time to a school of community agency. Said Litow:
``These are incentives at the employee and management level that
support strong corporate citizenship.''

DERBY TO BE TWICE THE FUN FOR LUKAS 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Includes Derby contenders text table)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By RON INDIRISANO  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Trainer D. Wayne Lukas will go to the Kentucky Derby with both
barrels loaded.
</P>
<P>
   It appeared Lukas would have just one horse, Cat Thief, in the
Run for the Roses. Cat Thief is a hard-trying sort, but he has been
unable to win in four starts this year. That changed Sunday, when
Lukas saddled Charismatic to victory in the $378,700 Lexington
Stakes at Keeneland. The next stop for Charismatic, a son of Summer
Squall owned by Bob and Beverly Lewis, owners of Silver Charm, will
be the Derby May 1. Normally, a horse with a career record of
14-3-2-3 would be dismissed from Derby consideration, but not this
year, with the race the most wide open in memory.
</P>
<P>
   ``He keeps getting better and better,'' said Lukas. ``I've
trained him harder than I have any other horse coming up to the
Derby. The Derby was next whether it was win, lose, or draw in the
Lexington.''
</P>
<P>
   As it turned out, Charismatic dominated the field under Jerry
Bailey, winning by 2 1/2 lengths in 1:41, a new stakes record, for
the mile and one-16th. Charismatic was off at 12-1 ($26.20 to win),
surprisingly high odds considering he had run a decent fourth in
the $1 million Santa Anita Derby April 3, a test considered the
best of the Derby preps this season.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were going real easy down the backside,'' said Bailey. ``I
was just sitting there waiting for my spot.''
</P>
<P>
   Trainer Bob Baffert will have at least two Derby entrants, Prime
Timber and General Challenge; Nick Zito also will have two, Adonis
and Stephen Got Even; and now Lukas will have a duo as well. Once
again, the trainer with the highest profile in America, whose
election to the Hall of Fame will be announced during Derby week,
refuses to be outdone.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A strong hand
</P>
<P>
   Baffert unquestionably holds the strongest hand. General
Challenge and Prime Timber finished 1-2 in the Santa Anita Derby,
respectively, and both worked very well in their first trip over
the Churchill Downs strip. Also, Sillverbulletday, the fine filly
trained by Baffert and owned by Mike Pegram, owner of Real Quiet,
last year's Derby winner, is training sensationally under the Twin
Spires. However, Baffert continues to insist he is leaning toward
starting Silverbulletday in the Kentucky Oaks April 30, instead of
the Derby. On Saturday, General Challenge worked 5 furlongs in 1:00
1/5, out 6 furlongs in 1:12 1/5; while Prime Timber went 1:00 3/5,
out in 1:13 2/5. ``He's amazing,'' said exercise rider Dana Barnes
of General Challenge. ``Sometimes, when Bob gives me the fractions
(via walkie-talkie), I think, `There's no way, he's not going that
fast, I don't believe you.' I look around and see if he's watching
the wrong horse or something.'' ``He has really improved,'' said
Barnes of Prime Timber. ``He's grown up so much. Before, he would
hang with a horse while training; now, he just opens up.''
Silverbulletday sizzled five panels in 59 seconds Sunday, more than
two seconds faster than any other drill at that distance on that
day's Churchill work tab. ``She's quick and she loves this track,
but I'm still thinking Oaks,'' said Baffert. ``I know what it takes
for the Derby, and maybe something could change, but the field
would have to change a lot. It's a large field and she's a little
filly, she's light.'' . . . Exploit, who also was trained by
Baffert and was the winter-book favorite for the Derby until he was
injured finishing second in the San Felipe March 13, his only
defeat, will stand at stud at Taylor Made Farm in Nicholasville,
Ky. No stud fee has bee set. The son of Storm Cat won five of his
six starts and earned nearly $400,000 in his brief career . . .
Desert Hero, third in the Santa Anita Derby in only the third start
of his career, worked 7 furlongs in 1:23 4/5 at Santa Anita
Saturday. ``This was a good tightener for him,'' said trainer
Richard Mandella.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A Quiet year
</P>
<P>
   Real Quiet has run only twice this year and has lost both races.
After running second in the New Orleans Handicap at Fair Grounds
March 7, his first start since losing the Belmont Stakes, and
Triple Crown, by a nose to Victory Gallop last June, Real Quiet was
beaten again Sunday in the $250,000 Texas Mile at Lone Star. This
time, Real Quiet ran into a tiger as he was outfinished by
defending champion Littlebitlively. A 5-year-old son of Lively One,
Littlebitlively is tough at a mile, and he and Carlos Gonzalez held
off Real Quiet and Gary Stevens to prevail by a neck.
Littlebitlively, who was 5-2 ($7.40 to win), covered the distance
in 1:35 3/5. Real Quiet, who was 1-2, ran well and stuck his head
in front turning for home, but Littlebitlively came back along the
rail to gain the edge. ``I was surprised that they let me make the
lead so easily,'' said Gonzalez. ``He really wanted to go early,
but I got him to relax. He was running easy. I just waited for
someone to come to me.'' Next for both horses will be the Pimlico
Special, at 1 1/8 miles, May 8 . . . Suffolk Downs plans to begin
grass racing May 1 and 2-year-old racing May 2. Management believes
the infield course will be in top shape because dry weather has
prevailed during March and April, keeping the turf firm. The first
juvenile contest will be for fillies at 4 furlongs, followed the
next day by a like contest for colts . . . Suffolk will accept
advance wagering on the Derby, starting Friday, April 30. On Derby
Day, gates will open at 10:30 a.m., and Suffolk will offer a
souvenir Derby glass and a pass for the month of May with paid
admission.

THE LOVE SONGS OF THORSTEIN VEBLEN 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By ALEX BEAM  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Just the other day someone asked me what I did during my recent
fellowship at Stanford University. I responded with the usual
noises about studying psychology and going to the opera. But the
truthful answer would have been: I was researching Thorstein
Veblen's sex life.
</P>
<P>
   Not every distinguished man's sex life is worth researching, as
I learned while reading Evan Thomas's biography of superlawyer
Edward Bennett Williams. The extramarital dalliances (in the
company of the sainted Joe DiMaggio) of a repressed Catholic who
attended Mass every morning make for dull fare. But Veblen, the
enfant terrible of the turn-of-the-century economics profession,
enjoyed not just an interesting sex life; as his latest biographers
Elizabeth and Henry Jorgensen make clear, he enjoyed a life in
full.
</P>
<P>
   Nowadays, Veblen's name is more likely to pop up on ``Jeopardy''
(April 11, 1997; category ``The Midwest'') than in a college
classroom. Too rusty for economics courses, his landmark ``Theory
of the Leisure Class'' occasionally appears in American Studies
courses. In their biography, ``Thorstein Veblen: Victorian
Firebrand,'' the Jorgensens complain, with some justification, that
Veblen is a ``lost man''; ``for a century, America has been in
denial about Veblen's ideas,'' which have been ``buried underneath
a sanitary landfill of lies and half-truths.''
</P>
<P>
   (I recall a conversation with Ms. Jorgensen, during which she
suggested that my article on Veblen's Stanford entanglements
(www.stanfordmag.org/sepoct97/articles/veblen.html) belonged to
said landfill.)
</P>
<P>
   So let the excavations begin!
</P>
<P>
   There can be no such thing as a dull biography of Veblen, and
this one does not disappoint. Born, yes, in a log cabin, the man
who would later anathematize the titans of capital was a cradle
contrarian. ``He is queer and always has been queer,'' his brother
Ed complained, using the word in the old-fashioned sense. While
Sioux marauders were killing fellow Norwegian homesteaders in
Minnesota during the 1860s, the boy Thorstein sided with the
Indians. ``Shortly after the close of the Civil War,'' his brother
noted, ``he took the side of the South.''
</P>
<P>
   A-religious _ ``If there is a difference between religion and
magic I have never seen it,'' he once said _ Veblen disdained his
family's prairie Lutheranism and mocked the pieties of America's
Golden Age. He was at heart an anthropologist. ``The Theory of the
Leisure Class'' represents fieldwork among the grandees who sent
their children to the universities where he taught, and among his
censorious in-laws. That he likened ``conspicuous consumption'' of
unneeded luxuries to the ceremonial face painting of African
chieftains made him few friends. His trenchant analysis of what
came to be called male chauvinism in his essay ``The Barbarian
Status of Women'' made him even more unpopular. Except, perhaps,
among women.
</P>
<P>
   Veblen attracted intelligent women, who shared his contempt for
male ritual. Even for the serious-minded Jorgensens, it seems
impossible to separate Veblen's life story from his love stories.
His first wife, Ellen Rolfe, destroyed his academic career by
tattling about her husband's affairs to the presidents of Stanford
and the University of Chicago. After trudging all night through a
blizzard to visit his second wife in Nowhere, Idaho, Veblen
contracted a double pneumonia that crippled him for life.
</P>
<P>
   Veblen wasn't all sweetness and light. The Jorgensens correctly
note that even his most famous writings seem thick and turgid to
the modern taste. But he was that rarest of birds in 20th century
America: a dangerous thinker. It's delicious to imagine what Veblen
would have made of Tina Brown's New Yorker _ a magazine so full of
gibberish that you had to read it _ or of ``Seinfeld''-mania, the
fetishistic worship of . . . nothing.
</P>
<P>
   That Veblen should have lived so long to read sympathetic
biographies of the robber barons Rockefeller and Morgan . . . Maybe
he's better off where he is, chuckling at our frailties from the
great beyond.

ANGRY, BORED, CONFUSED? THIS BOOK'S FOR YOU 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DAVID NYHAN  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Some books aim to go deep, and some go for being broad. ``Angry,
Bored, Confused'' is one of the broad ones.
</P>
<P>
   The fresh survey of the current political scene by Bridgewater
(Mass.) State College professor Michael J. Kryzanek lives up to its
subtitle: ``A Citizen Handbook of American Politics.''
</P>
<P>
   First the good news: There are only two fleeting references to
Monica Lewinsky, and the Starr Report is mentioned (``tawdry'')
only in connection with a disapproving explanation of shock
journalism. But the role of scandal in American political history
is thoroughly aired in the context of explaining the periodic waves
of apathy and anger sparked by the usual suspects (Watergate,
Teapot Dome, etc.) as well as the hazy ones _ I am still a little
shaky on the Tilden-Hayes imbroglio.
</P>
<P>
   A short and ideologically neutral epilogue alludes to the Senate
impeachment debate, but the author is more interested in linking
the impeachment to the deeply rooted irritation Americans feel
toward politicians and journalists for forcing that squalid
business under their noses.
</P>
<P>
   The bad news? Cynicism is rampant, for all the obvious reasons.
Voter participation is charted ominously. The media peddle scandal
and conspiracy at every turn. Kryzanek describes ``the X-Filing of
America'' by conspiracy theorists who feed off the gamy fare
offered by ``the dark side of the evening news.'' Into a broad
national context he weaves the threads of the Murrah Federal
Building bombing in Oklahoma City, the mishandling federal agents
of the Waco debacle, the demoralizing impact of unquenchable
campaign finance outrages.
</P>
<P>
   What's particularly useful about ``Angry, Bored, Confused'' is
the way the 292 pages are broken up into bite-size chunks of
readily accessible charts, quote boxes, polling breakdowns,
demographic entrailing, and reading lists at the end of each
chapter. The presentation is straight down the middle, no
recognizable bias to either right or left.
</P>
<P>
   For anyone interested in contemporary politics, whether it's the
debate about how large a defense budget is big enough or the
skeletal innards of NAFTA and the foreign trade debate, this is a
helpful jumping-off point. It would take the student _ anyone from
high school to grad school would find this a handy compendium for
papers or exams _ easily into the next level of discussion.
</P>
<P>
   Kryzanek's aim was to make a user-friendly text for his college
students, and the publisher casts the result as a guide for the
``anxious consumer'' of political news. Unless you are a daily
communicant with a first-class newspaper, a lot of the serious work
of the journalism world skates right past you.
</P>
<P>
   It is a fact, much lamented by newspaper proprietors and
believers in the American system of government, that young people
today are seduced away from reading serious newspaper fare by
television and shock-jock radio. If it is true that the students of
the '90s are far less politically aware than their parents of the
'60s, then a compendium such as ``Angry, Bored, Confused'' is a
useful how-to manual for understanding the political game and the
stakes.
</P>
<P>
   In 1966, 58 percent of incoming college freshmen said keeping up
with political affairs is ``very important.'' Last year, only 27
percent agreed. When you cut the level of political interest among
your educated young by half in three decades, something is rotten
in the state of American politics.
</P>
<P>
   At the start of the country's history, George Washington wrote
that the people of the 13 colonies had to do their part as well,
``and if their citizens should not be completely free and happy,
the fault will be entirely their own.'' That is not the case today.
Complaining about the government is as ingrained as complaining
about taxes and as close as the nearest radio dial.
</P>
<P>
   After his lengthy survey of the American political scene, the
author begins his epilogue with a Groucho Marx line: ``Politics is
the art of looking for trouble, finding it everywhere, diagnosing
it incorrectly, and applying the wrong remedies.''
</P>
<P>
   Kryzanek even gives you a short quiz to see if you're a liberal
or a conservative. It's simplest version: If your hero was Franklin
Roosevelt (government is the solution to what ailed America in the
Depression), then you're a liberal. If your hero is Ronald Reagan
(government is the problem), then you're a conservative.
</P>
<P>
   Regardless of your answer, if you read this book, you're a lot
better informed about politics and government than you were
beforehand, and you have a better grip on what must be done to
improve things.

SHAKESPEARE IN `ECOTOPIA' 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MARTIN F. NOLAN  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   LA JOLLA, Calif. _ Celebrants have saluted one since 1970 and
the other since 1564. Earth Day and William Shakespeare's birthday
honor similar ideals: a sense of order, balance, and the ``placing
of man in the traditional cosmic setting between the angels and the
beasts.''
</P>
<P>
   That is the judgment of ``The Elizabethan World Picture,''
written more than 50 years ago by a Cambridge don with the hefty
handle of Eustace Mandeville Wetenhall Tillyard. Environmentalists,
who rely on hard science, could consider Tillyard's scholarship in
the humanities as green as a rainforest when he explains what
Shakespeare's audiences took for granted.
</P>
<P>
   What Alexander Pope called ``a vast chain of being'' included
the four elements of earth, water, fire, and air. ``When Cleopatra
said she was all air and fire, the educated part of the audience at
least would understand without the slightest effort of memory. The
property of air and fire was to go upwards in a straight line, as
was that of earth and water to go down,'' Tillyard explains in a
slim, 109-page book.
</P>
<P>
   Elizabethans would have understood modern ecological disasters.
Smog over Los Angeles? Too much fire in the air. Chernobyl and
Three Mile Island? Too much fire in the earth.
</P>
<P>
   Shakespeare was born on ``the uncertain glory of an April day,''
as spring is described by Proteus, one of ``The Two Gentlemen of
Verona,'' the Beach Boys of their time. On the beaches of La Jolla,
this April's glory is certain. Surfers and snorkelers, bikers and
strollers savor the beaches of this town, ``jewel'' in Spanish. La
Jolla is a capital of what the bard of American geography, Joel
Garreau, calls ``Ecotopia,'' one of his nine nations of North
America. The Pacific coast is the hub of outdoor life, from here to
Big Sur to Santa Cruz up to Puget Sound.
</P>
<P>
   The four elements survive today mostly in the astrological
columns, but in Shakespeare's time they commanded the center of
political debate between the medieval and the modern, rather like a
typical Republican National Convention.
</P>
<P>
   ``In spite of Copernicus and a wide knowledge of his theories
through popular handbooks, the ordinary educated Elizabethan
thought of the universe as geocentric,'' Tillyard writes.
Shakespeare's villains are in the Copernican camp, sneering
satirically at the influence of the zodiac. ``The fault, dear
Brutus, is not in the stars but in ourselves,'' says Cassius in
``Julius Caesar.'' In ``King Lear,'' Edmund mocks ``the excellent
foppery of the world,'' that ``we make guilty of our disasters the
sun, the moon, and the stars.''
</P>
<P>
   Elizabethans were open to learning, and even Marlowe's
Tamburlaine would have approved of the Scripps Institution of
Oceanography here:
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
(poetry style &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Nature, that fram'd us of four elements
</P>
<P>
   Warring within our breasts for regiment
</P>
<P>
   Doth teach us all to have aspiring minds.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
(end poetry style) &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Order encompassed more than four elements, and its most stirring
summations are in Shakespeare's later plays. ``The Tempest'' takes
place in the Bermuda Triangle, what he called ``the vexed
Bermoothes,'' where Miranda welcomes a ``brave, new world.'' In
``Troilus and Cressida,'' Ulysses says that when the planets
``observe degree, priority, and place,'' all is well, yet ``Take
but degree away, untune that string, and hark, what discord
follows.''
</P>
<P>
   On the shores of Ecotopia, on the edge of the mighty Pacific, a
few winter storms away from destruction, they still issue building
permits on the bluffs of Encinitas for expensive houses. In his
64th sonnet, Shakespeare warns of the day:
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
(poetry style) &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   When I have seen the hungry ocean gain
</P>
<P>
   Advantage on the kingdom of the shore
</P>
<P>
   And the firm soil win of the watery main,
</P>
<P>
   Increasing store with loss and loss with store.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
(end poetry style) &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The soundest environmental impact statement ever filed was
Puck's, who proclaimed in ``A Midsummer's Night Dream'': ``Lord,
what fools these mortals be!''

</HEADLINE>

 By LINDA MATCHAN  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   It's 11:15 p.m. and all is quiet at Ariel Klemmer's house. The
homework's done. The folks are in bed. Even Chip, the pet
chinchilla, is down for the night.
</P>
<P>
   But Ariel, 17, is in the family room, hunkered down in front of
the computer, where things are just starting to heat up. In their
respective homes, the same is true for Eric Hou, Nisha Hirani,
Brian Hemond, Casey Sukeforth, and Erica Holland, to name just a
few friends Ariel will be ``i.m.-ing'' tonight.
</P>
<P>
   ``Instant messaging,'' an Internet tool that lets computer users
have live conversations, is to teenagers of the cyber-generation
what the princess phone was to baby boomers _ stupefying parents
who can't understand what their kids could be saying to each other
for so long, and effectively denying phone or computer access to
anyone else in the household.
</P>
<P>
   It's not e-mail, since conversations are held in real time. It's
not a chat room, since conversations take place between two people
(although several can be held simultaneously, in different
windows), and messages can only be sent to and from people on the
user's own predetermined ``buddy list'' if they happen to be on
line at the same time.
</P>
<P>
   Instant messaging is more like a written telephone conversation.
Or the script of a play, one with lots of characters, assorted
sound effects, but no obvious final act. It's real life, for better
or worse.
</P>
<P>
   An actual conversation:
</P>
<P>
   Brian to Ariel (who is also talking to Casey): What's up :).
</P>
<P>
   Ariel to Brian: Not much.
</P>
<P>
   (Sound of a door squeaking, an America Online gimmick to
indicate that someone who is on line is getting off.)
</P>
<P>
   Ariel to Eric: Why did Erica leave?
</P>
<P>
   Eric: I dunno, she's done that, like, five times.
</P>
<P>
   Ariel to Eric: Freaky.
</P>
<P>
   Eric to Ariel: Yeah, weird. (He steers the conversation to his
plans to get a passport.) My dad says it'll take like 10 days.
</P>
<P>
   Ariel to Eric: Can you pay to get it done right away?
</P>
<P>
   Eric to Ariel: It's $35. That's 3 1/2 Presidential Breakfasts
(at Bickford's) with 3 1/2 sides of toast. I'm too cheap.
</P>
<P>
   Etc.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
----- &QC; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   According to a spokesman for American Online, which popularized
the use of instant messaging, some 432 million instant messages
travel across AOL each day, but there are no figures on the age of
the senders. (A number of other services, such as ICQ and Yahoo,
offer the feature, too.)
</P>
<P>
   But it's a good guess, based on interviews with area teens, that
a large percentage of the users are high school and middle school
students, along with a smaller number of their copycat siblings in
elementary school.
</P>
<P>
   In the household of the Joyce family, 12-year-old Caitlin has 89
i.m. buddies on her list, while her younger sister Kristin, 9, has
(at last count) 82.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's like a little party every night,'' observes Dan Klemmer,
Ariel's father. `I find it very interesting that there is this
thing called phones and they see each other during the day, and yet
(instant messaging) is a religious event.''
</P>
<P>
   From a teen's point of view, the advantages are numerous. It
doesn't make the phone ring and wake up parents. It makes gossip
instantaneous. You can talk to several people at once _ and surf
the Web for a homework project, on a different screen, at the same
time. (You can also listen to music, eat a bowl of cereal, and talk
on the phone _ if you happen to have a second line.)
</P>
<P>
   ``It's very fun,'' giggles Erica Holland, 16, a junior at
Lexington (Mass.) High School, and one of Ariel Klemmer's regular
i.m. partners. ``You get to talk to a whole bunch of people. If
they're people I don't see a lot during the day, I feel like I am
in contact with them.'' She considers i.m.-ing either ``relaxing''
or ``hectic'' _ depending on how many people she is talking to at
once. (Unlike her friend Ariel, who has been known to manage six
i.m. converations at the same time, Erica says she only juggles
three comfortably.)
</P>
<P>
   ``I actually get a lot of work done while I'm on line,''
contends Erica's friend and frequent i.m. partner Eric Hou, 18, a
senior at Lexington High. ``It's not like substantial 10-page
essays, but if I have some busywork, I'll do that, like 10 problems
in math.''
</P>
<P>
   Bopping from conversation to conversation, from screen to
screen, isn't much of an exertion to him. ``It doesn't seem to bug
me that much,'' he says. ``I've grown up around computers. It's
just been, like, this big thing in my life.''
</P>
<P>
   Did someone mention a generation gap? ``I am usually stunned
when someone sends me (an i.m.),'' says Sue Cohen, a lawyer and
mother of two i.m-literate daughters. ``It's not like when you go
to your mailbox, and you take a letter out and look at the return
address and open it up. Someone knows you're on line. That blows me
away.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
----- &QC; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Not surprisingly, a network of subtle rules and etiquette has
evolved around teenage i.m. use. For example:
</P>
<P>
   --No thought or observation is too trivial or mundane (for
example: ``I'm hungry'' or ``my foot fell asleep.'')
</P>
<P>
   --Abbreviations and shorthand are encouraged. As in: lol
(``laughing out loud''); brb (``be right back''); jk (``just
kidding.'') Likewise, code language is desirable. Consider this
exchange between Ariel Klemmer and Erica Holland:
</P>
<P>
   Erica: How's your running?
</P>
<P>
   Ariel: Great.
</P>
<P>
   Erica: Bread?
</P>
<P>
   Ariel: Extended forest.
</P>
<P>
   Erica: Was Eric mad?
</P>
<P>
   Ariel: When I run I don't get hungry. And he was like, where
were u?
</P>
<P>
   Erica: :)
</P>
<P>
   (Translation: Ariel and Eric and another girl started out
running together. Erica asks if they did the ``bread run''
referring to the route past a bakery that offers free bread slices.
No, responds Ariel, they left Eric and ran down Forest Street, and
a little farther. Eric, meanwhile, spent 20 minutes waiting for
them at the bread store.)
</P>
<P>
   --Speed is favored over precision; proper spelling and
punctuation may be disregarded.
</P>
<P>
   --It is important to be considerate of others. Always answer
promptly, for fear of being labeled ``boring'' or of being
``canceled,'' whereby one user chooses not to get another's
messages. Don't overdo visual devices (``I've been said to abuse
smiley faces,'' confesses Erica Holland.)
</P>
<P>
   --It is considered very rude to fall asleep. ``When that
happens, I give up and turn the whole thing off,'' says Nisha
Hirani, 17.
</P>
<P>
   --Changing your screen names frequently is cool, especially
among younger i.m.-ers. ``I just, like, get sick of one,'' says
Caitlin Joyce, 12, whose recent screen names have included
shamrock23, joycer27, and fitchlax1 (a composite of her combined
interests in Abercrombie &AMP; Fitch and lacrosse.)
</P>
<P>
   --If you're desperate and no one else is on line, you can always
talk to yourself, suggests Caitlin. ``It's really fun.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
----- &QC; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   What is an adult to make of this rapid-fire, minimalist form of
socializing? Of these ``virtuosos . . . (in the) layering of
communication modes,'' says MIT's Sherry Turkle, who teaches the
sociology of science.
</P>
<P>
   Parents seem to either love it or hate it. They worry that it's
keeping their kids up at night and preventing them from getting
their homework done. On the other hand, they always know where
their kids are. And it improves their typing skills.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's kind of cute on a lot of levels,'' says Dan Klemmer, a
sixth-grade teacher in Cambridge, Mass. ``Friendships meant
everything to me in high school.'' Adds Ariel's mother, Toby
Kaplin, ``Kids are under a lot of pressure now. It's a nice
release.''
</P>
<P>
   As for the experts, the verdict's still out. Some say that
beyond the novelty factor of instant messaging, there are some
actual developmental advantages to this form of socializing.
</P>
<P>
   ``Kids really want to have a group identity and connect with
kids as part of separating from parents without really
separating,'' says John Suler, a professor at Rider University in
New Jersey who specializes in the psychology of cyberspace. ``The
computer is a nifty solution to that.''

   Carol Weston, a teen expert and columnist for Girls' Life
magazine, believes instant messaging is a ``less intimidating''
form of communication for some teens, eliminating the need for
scary eye contact and ``talking to kids you might otherwise not
have that much in common with.''
</P>
<P>
   On the other hand, instant messaging makes it ``easy to feel
excluded,'' says Steve Bennett, who has written extensively about
computers and kids, including the book ``Plugged-in Parent''
(Random House, 1998). ``The sad thing is there are kids who just
kind of sit there and wait for someone'' to answer their i.m.
</P>
<P>
   And the ``emotionless' aspect of instant messaging may not, he
fears, be entirely benign. ``It does not encourage thoughtful
reflection,'' he says. And smiley faces aside, ``it's an
emotionless form of communication.''
</P>
<P>
   Is it possible that today's teens will evolve into a generation
of fast-fingered, socially inept grown-ups?
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think this is helping,'' Bennett says.

 CAMPUS MOVEMENTS AIM TO IMPROVE OVERSEAS FACTORY CONDITIONS
 &HT;    (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By GREGG KRUPA  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
<TEXT>
 &QL;
<P>
   In the campus protest movement of the 1990s, students are taking
on big business _ and starting to win.
</P>
<P>
   In an echo of activism by preceding generations who fought for
civil rights and divestment from South Africa, students now are
taking aim at companies like Nike, Reebok, Starter and Champion.
Their goal: Improving conditions at the overseas factories used by
makers of athletic shoes and licensed clothing. With help from
unions and human rights groups, the students are employing familiar
tactics like sit-ins, teach-ins and demonstrations.
</P>
<P>
   And they are beginning to change the practices and policies of
the companies and the universities who are partners in the $2.5
billion-a-year licensed apparel industry.
</P>
<P>
   The students are redoubling their efforts this spring _
including a series of conferences at Harvard, Kent and Stanford
universities this month _ to work toward a new goal of derailing a
Clinton administration effort to reform the apparel industry. The
students say the Department of Labor's attempts have been
ineffective and probusiness.
</P>
<P>
   ``The student involvement got this on the agenda of the
universities, and that is starting to drive some significant
change,'' says US Representative George Miller (D-Calif.), an
advocate for reform. ``The students made the universities take it
as a serious matter.''
</P>
<P>
   With pressure rising on campuses, and university administrators
acknowledging they understand the students' point, the companies
have been forced to respond.
</P>
<P>
   In recent weeks, both Nike and Reebok have issued dueling news
releases trumpeting wage increases at their plants in Indonesia.
Industry observers, like Bob McGee, editor of Sporting Goods
Intelligence, say that the pay increases and the companys' concern
about public relations are a direct response to the students'
actions and their impact on campus.
</P>
<P>
   And Nike recently announced a willingness to disclose the
location of all of its plants overseas, satisfying one of the
students' major proposals for independent monitoring of conditions
at shoe and apparel factories outside the United States.
</P>
<P>
   ``Students have always played a traditional role in helping to
foment change,'' says Vada Manager, the director of global issues
management for Nike, one of the students' major targets. ``And
they're citing some reasonable issues that we've responded to, and
we'll continue to do that.''
</P>
<P>
   Colleges and universities have long engaged the manufacturers of
T-shirts, sweatshirts, jackets, caps and other clothing in
agreements to use the schools' official names, colors and
insignias. The manufacturers pay a lucrative licensing fee, which
the schools use as revenue for their general fund, scholarships or
athletic departments.
</P>
<P>
   At Harvard, the licensing fee yields about $500,000 to $700,000
per year that is applied to undergraduate financial aid, officials
say. At Boston College, the sale of licensed apparel generated $2.6
million last year.
</P>
<P>
   And at the major, national athletic powers with huge alumni
bodies, like the University of Michigan and the University of Notre
Dame, the revenue is much higher. At Michigan, $5.7 million was
raised in 1998 when the football and hockey teams both won national
championships.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's an issue that's really close to us,'' says Rachel
Salomon, one of the student activists at Boston University. ``We
buy this stuff, and it helps pay for things that we do at BU. It's
our responsibility.''
</P>
<P>
   Students have targeted work conditions at apparel and shoe
plants in Latin America, the Caribbean and Asia in which workers in
plants owned by American companies, or contracted by them, often
pay wages that are well below what governments in those countries
say is sufficient to support a family.
</P>
<P>
   Activists also assert that many young women's decisions about
childbirth and child care are dictated by employers, and that
workers are prevented from any union organizing.
</P>
<P>
   Overseas sweatshops burst into the limelight in 1996, when
Kathie Lee Gifford attracted negative publicity for working
conditions at plants making her brand of clothing. Labor unions and
human rights groups had been targeting Nike and other companies for
several years. But no one seemed to be listening.
</P>
<P>
   Then, in 1997, the AFL-CIO and other unions tapped dozens of
students for internships. ``It was called Union Summer and it had a
similar impact as Freedom Summer for college students during the
civil rights movement,'' recalls Ginny Coughlin, of the Union of
Needletrades, Industrial and Textile Employees.
</P>
<P>
   Critics claim that much of the student activism has been
provoked and underwritten by organized labor. But the students
reject the assertions.
</P>
<P>
   ``By no means are we puppets of big labor,'' says Peter
Romer-Friedman, a student leader in the antisweatshop efforts at
Michigan. ``It's no different from (student) civil rights activists
using the NAACP in the 1960s.''
</P>
<P>
   What has followed Union Summer is a series of demonstrations on
campus. Students launched sit-ins at Duke University, Georgetown
University, Michigan and the University of Wisconsin in recent
months. At more than 50 other campuses, from Massachusetts to
California, students circulated petitions, launched Web sites and
picketed.
</P>
<P>
   Many of the universities have responded. Thirty-three have
joined the Fair Labor Association, a White House-backed group of
schools, companies, unions and human rights organizations that aims
to set and enforce codes of conduct for the overseas factories.
</P>
<P>
   Michigan and Wisconsin now insist they will not make any
licensing agreements with companies that do not disclose the
location of overseas plants. Michigan also has pledged to study the
issue of ``a living wage,'' to test what pay levels are appropriate
in which countries.
</P>
<P>
   Moves toward reform have been particularly swift and sweeping at
Catholic universities like Boston College. According to a BC
spokesman, Angela Borzon, a senior, approached the Rev. Joseph
Appleyard, the vice president of ministry and mission, and told him
of the students' concerns. The next day, at Appleyard's behest,
vice presidents of BC voted unanimously to accept the students'
challenge to establish a code of conduct for BC's licensed
companies.
</P>
<P>
   While many of the schools are meeting the students' demands, the
companies are showing different degrees of flexibility.
</P>
<P>
   Reebok officials assert they have actually been ahead of some of
the student leaders and unions. Reebok says its factories pay
workers in Indonesia 43 percent more than the established minimum
wage and now keeps the plants free of toxic glues. Reebok even
helped bring a pilot program on union organizing from an arm of the
AFL-CIO to five factories in Asia.
</P>
<P>
   But other companies, like Champion, a division of Sara Lee, and
Pro Player, the sports and licensing division of Fruit of the Loom,
seem less aware of the sweatshop issue.
</P>
<P>
   Peggy Carter, vice president of corporate affairs at Champion,
says the company will never accede to the students' demand for full
disclosure of manufacturing sites overseas. ``We have no interest
in our competition learning where we are located and taking
advantage of what has taken us years to build,'' Carter says.
</P>
<P>
   A spokesman for Pro Player said the company was not even aware
of the Fair Labor Association.
</P>
<P>
   The Clinton administration has been working to organize the
group for two years. The intention is to bind the companies,
unions, human rights groups and universities to a single code of
conduct for overseas apparel manufacturing.
</P>
<P>
   The companies will pay dues ranging from $5,000 to $100,000
each, based on their annual sales. Universities will pay 1 percent
of their annual licensing revenues, up to $50,000.
</P>
<P>
   But students say the association is fatally flawed because it
has not called for full disclosure of the overseas manufacturing
sites or for the payment of a living wage.
</P>
<P>
   Some labor unions have walked out on the FLA process, and
administrators at some of schools say they will either not join the
association, or join it while holding their own licensees to a
higher standard.
</P>
<P>
   ``We agreed to join the Fair Labor Association, but we also
realize there are a lot of question marks with the FLA,'' says
Allan Ryan Jr., Harvard's general counsel. ``It may or may not
prove to be an effective way of improving situations in the
sweatshops.''
</P>
<P>
   And if not enough companies join FLA, ``it's a dead letter,''
says Ryan.
</P>
<P>
   Harvard may soon have a new statement of general policies and
practices that will govern its licensing partners, he adds.
</P>
<P>
   ``Would any of this be happening if the students and the trade
unions supporting them were not involved?'' Ryan asks. ``The answer
is no.''

WORKERS` COMP COMPANIES SWEAT IN SUNNY MARKET 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By STEVEN SYRE AND CHARLES STEIN  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   It's hard to find a happier story in Massachusetts than the
story of workers' compensation.
</P>
<P>
   Over the past four years, the rates employers pay to insure
employees against the cost of injury have dropped 48 percent. The
number of on-the-job injuries has dropped, injured workers are
getting back to work faster, and the system for handling disputes
has been streamlined.
</P>
<P>
   So why aren't the insurance companies that write workers'
compensation cheering? It could be because they aren't making any
money. Liberty Mutual, the nation's biggest workers' comp insurer,
last week issued its annual report. The Boston company's profits
from all its domestic insurance business were down 40 percent.
</P>
<P>
   In workers' comp, Liberty lost money for the second year in a
row, according to president Edmund Kelly. The company looks for no
more than a break-even year in 1999. ``Wars of attrition are not
good wars to be in,'' says Kelly, explaining the grim numbers.
</P>
<P>
   The insurance business always goes through cycles and in
workers' comp the swings have been wild ones. In the '80s, insurers
bailed out of the market because they were losing so much money.
After many states, including Massachusetts, passed major comp
reform laws in the early '90s, conditions and profits improved.
</P>
<P>
   Those profits, however, attracted new competitors the way nectar
attracts bees, To gain a foothold in the market, the new players
cut prices, setting off a war that is still being waged. ``There
are too many companies writing business and a lot of them are
losing money,'' says James Walter, president of ManagedComp, an
insurer based in Waltham. Both Walter and Kelly say the new
competitors don't really understand the comp business and may not
fully appreciate how badly they are doing.
</P>
<P>
   In Massachusetts, where many insurance rates are set by the
state, insurers are offering discounts _ sometimes as much as 30
percent _ on top of the official 48 percent rate cut. As in auto
insurance, the discounts typically are offered only to companies
with the best safety records. The comp insurers all say they would
love to end the discounts, but as the auto insurers have found,
once customers get used to a bargain they don't like to give it up.
</P>
<P>
   The workers' comp insurers are not asking for the moon. In the
rate case they filed recently with the Division of Insurance, the
insurers requested a modest 2.6 percent rate hike. ``We are hoping
for some stability,'' says Roy Stewart, head of the group that
represents the industry.
</P>
<P>
   Unfortunately for the insurers, stability may be too much to
hope for. At a recent hearing, virtually everyone testifying called
for more rate cuts. ``Employers have paid and are currently paying
more than they should for workers' compensation insurance,'' argued
Carolyn Boviard, director of economic development for the Cellucci
administration.
</P>
<P>
   Boviard said that the industry's past projections of losses have
failed to materialize so there is no reason to worry. The
Associated Industries of Massachusetts, a trade group, also urged a
rate cut. And Stephen D'Amato, a former state insurance official,
called for a ``massive double-digit rate decrease.''
</P>
<P>
   His proof that insurers could afford it? Because so many of them
are offering big discounts today. Gotcha.
</P>
<P>
   The final decision on rates will be made by Insurance
Commissioner Linda Ruthardt. Based on her track record, the
industry should be nervous. Last year the auto insurers asked for a
15 percent rate hike. Ruthardt granted them a raise of less than 1
percent.
</P>
<P>
   On the national level, Liberty's Kelly is not expecting a quick
fix. He thinks the industry may be approaching a turning point but
he foresees a slow and gradual turn. ``Appropriate prices are still
a couple of years away,'' he predicts.
</P>
<P>
   Put another way, employers can look forward to a few more years
of bargain-basement rates for workers' comp.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL; 
The Red Herring
</P>
<P>
   Two weeks ago we trumpeted the birth of a new era.
</P>
<P>
   After seven years as the Massachusetts company with the greatest
market value, Gillette relinquished the title to EMC, the
Hopkinton, Mass. technology firm.
</P>
<P>
   It turned out to be a short era. Last Friday, Gillette moved
back in to the number-one slot; its market value stood at $55.2
billion as of the end of the day Tuesday. Gillette's stock hasn't
done particularly well, but EMC's shares have been hammered, part
of a general technology sell-off. EMC closed at 102 3/16 Tuesday,
giving it a total market valuation of $51.4 billion; two weeks ago,
with the stock at 134, the company's market valuation was $67.2
billion. On the bright side, EMC Tuesday reported a 51 percent
increase in earnings and predicted smooth sailing for the rest of
the year.

CULINARY SLEUTH KEEPS HER EYE ON PARIS 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Includes ``Food-lover's day'' text table.)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By SHERYL JULIAN  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   PARIS _ The stylish proprietor tips a little hazelnut oil onto a
plate. Patricia Wells has been stepping aside in the narrow shop as
visitors sample almond oil, pistachio oil, and walnut oil. But when
Anne Leblanc opens the slender bottle of hazelnut, and that
unmistakable smell perfumes the air, Wells smiles and reaches for a
crust of baguette. The taste is earthy, toasty, and irresistibly
warm.
</P>
<P>
   This is what Wells does: She hunts down unusual food sources all
over this city and then introduces them to the world. It all began
15 years ago with her first list of great food finds, which she
published as ``The Food Lover's Guide to Paris'' (Workman). In the
book's fourth edition, out this month, Wells takes her fans to
Huilerie J. Leblanc oils and 23 other new spots.
</P>
<P>
   Leblanc was easy to find. It's near a landmark from her original
guide: the famous tea salon Mariage Freres, where $8 gets you a
brew selected by one of Europe's premier buyers. And it's not too
far from another spot in the new guide: Bistrots d'Autrefois, where
you can buy Ricard pitchers and other vintage bistro paraphernalia.
But Wells almost couldn't miss the oil shop: It's next door to her
newly acquired studio on Rue Jacob, one of the most fashionable
streets in the charming 6th arrondissement.
</P>
<P>
   After years of writing at home on the other side of the Seine,
she now works and cooks in her compact Left Bank studio _ though
she still goes home at night to Walter Wells, news editor of the
International Herald Tribune. Patricia Wells has worked at the
paper for almost 20 years, as its restaurant critic, so she's
hardly a tourist anymore. But she still discovers corners of Paris
in a wide-eyed way _ especially in her new neighborhood.
</P>
<P>
   A former jogger, Wells walks all over the city, which isn't
common here. Indeed, Parisians are so used to doing their marketing
close to home, she says, that sometimes she's asked: ``Vous etes du
quartier?'' (Do you belong here?)
</P>
<P>
   ``There are people in Paris who have never left their
neighborhood,'' she says. ``I get to 14 arrondissements every
day.''
</P>
<P>
   With Wells as tour guide, we set out recently to spend a day in
the life of a zealous Francophile foodie. Umbrella in one hand, the
Parisian's classic red book of maps in the other, we trail behind
her to Leblanc, as well as to a food market, a cookware shop, a
wine bar near the Sorbonne for lunch, and a boulangerie (just to
look at the beautiful breads and pastries). At day's end, we eat in
a homespun restaurant where the decor has hardly changed for two
decades, the husband cooks, and the wife greets guests.
</P>
<P>
   A typical Wells day invariably includes a stop at the closest
covered food market. In this neighborhood, one of the best is the
market that runs along Boulevard Raspail. Like all the others, this
is a roving market; on Sundays, it's the only organic market open
in Paris.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of these people grow their own food and make their own
cheese,'' Wells explains. She stops in front of an elderly,
heavy-set woman whose display consists mostly of root vegetables.
They're beautiful, like everything here, but somehow nicer _ even
fresher _ than the others. Later, Wells speculates that the woman
isn't just the seller but the grower. ``You can tell by her
hands.''
</P>
<P>
   Wells knows these vendors. ``If you sell potatoes with the
dirt,'' she says, moving briskly past a stall piled with expensive
spuds, ``you can charge more.'' Parisians, like Americans, are
interested in boutique-quality food and in the organic movement _
``biologique'' in French _ so dirt sells.
</P>
<P>
   Wells knows the growers' quirks, too. Passing a mound of beets,
she explains: ``These are always sold cooked. During the war, fuel
was so expensive that no one would buy them. So beet growers cooked
them in their fields over wood. That never changed.''
</P>
<P>
   We stop at a cookware shop to see if it has a french-fry cutter.
Wells is investigating how restaurateurs make fries for ``Paris
Cookbook,'' a book she's working on.
</P>
<P>
   She had wonderful fries at a restaurant and called the chef. ``I
said, `I want this recipe and this recipe.' I made an
appointment.''
</P>
<P>
   When she arrived at the restaurant, he wouldn't divulge the
formula. ``These are my secrets,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   She wouldn't give up. ``The French say no twice, then they say
yes. I knew he had a coal-fired stove. `Can I see your stove?' I
asked, figuring I'll get closer to the kitchen.''
</P>
<P>
   Once in the kitchen, she asked what kind of potato he used.
Then:
</P>
<P>
   ``How do you saute them?''
</P>
<P>
   ``No, no,'' he answered, like an outwitted fox. ``You don't
saute. You fry them in oil.'' And he began to demonstrate.
</P>
<P>
   Alas, Madame walked in, and the cooking lesson came to an abrupt
halt.
</P>
<P>
   Researching the guidebooks has changed the pace of Wells's days;
though the life of a restaurant critic in Paris may sound like the
epitome of glamour, it wasn't. ``I used to work in my pajamas until
8 p.m., when I would go out for dinner,'' she says.
</P>
<P>
   Even after 20 years in Paris, and even in Parisian black with a
quilted suede Chanel bag and patent-leather boots, the
Milwaukee-born Wells remains down to earth and decidedly un-French.
When she and her husband moved here, they planned to stay for only
two years. Walter Wells still has the Herald Tribune job he came
for: No. 2 on the editorial masthead. ``I'm the permanent
undersecretary,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   When he took that job, Patricia Wells had to leave a job she had
coveted for a long time, as a food writer for The New York Times
(where they met). And they had to leave a co-op apartment they had
just renovated.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was being a good wife and going with my husband,'' she says.
Months later, back visiting friends who lived in their old
building, she saw a heartbreaking sign in the laundry room:
``Garland stove for sale. Formerly owned by Patricia Wells.'' Her
renovation was being ripped apart. But there would be other
professional ranges _ and other writing opportunities.
</P>
<P>
   Patricia Wells became the unofficial French food correspondent
for a number of American publications, the Times included. Her
byline has appeared in all major food magazines, and after the
first ``Food Lover's Guide to Paris,'' she continued to write
books. Her ``Food Lover's Guide to France'' came out in 1987, and
``Patricia Wells at Home in Provence'' (Scribner), set in her
ocher-walled farmhouse kitchen, was published in 1996.
</P>
<P>
   That kitchen is in Chanteduc (``song of the owl''), an
18th-century stone house on 10 acres in Vaison-la-Romaine, in the
south of France. The Wellses bought the house 15 years ago; now,
they bottle their own wine, and she teaches cooking classes there
several times a year (at a fee of $3,000 for 5 1/2 days).
</P>
<P>
   It is a life to dream of, but Wells started dreaming of
something else. ``I wanted a change,'' she says. ``I didn't want to
change husbands. I didn't want to change professions. And I didn't
want to leave Paris. But I wanted to stop working in the spare
bedroom.''
</P>
<P>
   So she bought the studio. To get to work now, she takes the
metro across the river, then walks.
</P>
<P>
   She remodeled her new little place so that it, too, can be used
for classes. It bears the crisp quality of a new renovation, though
much of it has been fashioned from old pieces worked into the new.
She searched for this place and waited two years for the work on it
to be finished. It's small, like most living spaces in Paris _ and
expensive. ``I could afford 500 square feet,'' she says. ``I think
this is 498.''
</P>
<P>
   It's quite bright, lit by a row of frosted glass windows and a
vaulted glass ceiling. The kitchen has a huge white-tiled center
island whose drawers, from a defunct market, have such labels as
moutarde (mustard), girofles (cloves), and navets (turnips). A La
Cornue range sits along one wall, and two marble sinks, several
yards apart, are along another. There are no overhead cabinets and
only a small refrigerator. (A big ``American'' refrigerator, as
Wells calls it, is hidden in the flat, as are a washer and dryer.)
</P>
<P>
   Besides the kitchen, there is a small dining room with built-in
cabinetry, made from old cafe doors, and an office with a
butter-yellow leather couch that doubles as a bed. To turn the
office into a bedroom, large shutter doors, purchased at a flea
market, pull out of the walls and seal off all the computer
equipment and books. Eventually, says Wells, the apartment could
become a pied-a-terre, with the house in Provence the couple's main
residence.
</P>
<P>
   From here, they'll be able to slip across the Seine for an
espresso at Cafe Marly, which overlooks the I. M. Pei glass pyramid
in the Louvre courtyard (new guide); get buttery kugelhopf at
Boulangerie Alsacienne in the neighboring 5th arrondissement (old
guide); stop for a quick lunch at Le Mauzac wine bar, also in the
5th (new guide); hop on the metro to the 11th for a visit to one of
their favorite bistros, Auberge Pyrenees-Cevennes (new guide). Or
simply spend another day walking the streets to see what they find.
</P>
<P>
   It could be a memorable madeleine or an old cafe table looking
for a home. You never know.
</P>

A food-lover's day in Paris
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
   --Raspail Market is located on Boulevard Raspail, between Rue du
Cherche-Midi and Rue de Rennes. It's open on Tuesday, Friday, and
Sunday (when it's organic). Metro: Rennes or Sevres-Babylone.
</P>
<P>
   --Huilerie J. Leblanc handmade oils are located at 6 Rue Jacob,
Paris 6. Metro: St. Germain des Pres.
</P>
<P>
   --Le Mauzac wine bar is located at 7 Rue de l'Abbe-de-l'Epee,
Paris 5. Metro: Luxembourg. Patricia Wells loves the hanger steak
(called onglet), which is delicious. So are the fries, the
unfiltered Beaujolais, and the runny St. Marcellin cheese.
</P>
<P>
   --Kayser is located at 8 and 14 Rue Monge, Paris 5. Metro:
Maubert-Mutualite. Wells likes the open-faced sandwiches here,
including goat cheese and pear. ``If you have time for just one or
two bakery visits,'' she writes in the newest ``Food Lover's
Guide,'' ``make sure that Eric Kayser's shop is on your route.''
The shop at No. 14 offers all organic products. Flours for both
shops are stone-ground, the salt is sel de Guerande from Brittany,
and everything is rustic and beautiful.
</P>
<P>
   --Auberge Pyrenees-Cevennes is located at 106 Rue de la
Folie-Mericourt, Paris 11. Metro: Republique. When Lyon native
Francoise Petit married Daniel Constantin, they bought this classic
bistro and continued to make some of the former owner's
southwestern specialties. They also added Lyonnais dishes. So all
the food is hearty and quite wonderful. Hams and sausages hang from
the ceiling, and the place hasn't been given a face lift, which
makes it charming. Francoise, who greets you, is a ball of fire.
Daniel, hidden in the kitchen until the end of the night, is a
terrific cook. Order cassoulet, platters of sausages, and salad
with bacon, and roll yourself back to your hotel.

RULES CHANGE GIVES LAURIE HILL A CHANCE TO PLAY WORLD CUP 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By SUSAN BICKELHAUPT  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   ``Quieres hablar conmigo en Espanol?'' asks Laurie Hill with a
mischiveous smile.
</P>
<P>
   When a reporter begs off, Hill easily slides into English. It
is, after all, her native language, and she is an American citizen
who was born and bred in Los Angeles.
</P>
<P>
   But for the past year, Hill has been living south of the border.
It's not so much for her love of Mexico as much as her love of
soccer.
</P>
<P>
   She tried twice to make the US national team, and was cut both
times. Then, a year ago, a law allowed Hill to try another avenue.
Having a Mexican mother meant that she could try out for the
Mexican team.
</P>
<P>
   She made the cut last summer, and now will be on one of the 16
teams vying for the Women's World Cup. Her team will play Italy in
a first-round game in Foxborough, Mass. on June 27.
</P>
<P>
   Hill was part of the Women's World Cup contingent that came to
Boston Tuesday as part of its seven-city tour to promote the
tournament that begins June 16 and finishes at the Rose Bowl in
Pasadena, Calif., on July 10. A total of five games will be played
at Foxboro Stadium on June 20, June 27, and July 4.
</P>
<P>
   President and CEO of the organizing committee Marla Messing said
it's her goal to make the World Cup the ``largest single woman's
event ever held,'' and so far, she said, things are on the right
track.
</P>
<P>
   All 32 games will be broadcast either on ABC, ESPN, or ESPN2,
she said, and so far, 66 countries will air the games. In addition,
the event has 19 corporate sponsors.
</P>
<P>
   Ticket packages over the past 12 months have exceeded 325,000
sales. Single tickets have just gone on sale, ranging in price from
$20 to $75 for the Boston games.
</P>
<P>
   The committee also unveiled the World Cup trophy _ a spiraling
band of sterling silver and laminated gold tapering upward to
embrace a soccer ball _ and the World Cup theme song _ ``Because We
Want To,'' by British pop star Billie Piper.
</P>
<P>
   The American team was not on hand because they are training in
Hershey, Pa., where they'll face China Thursday and again Sunday at
Giants Stadium.
</P>
<P>
   Hill, a 5-foot-1 midfielder who was a three-time All-American at
the University of California at Santa Barbara, scored 27 goals and
had 26 assists in her college career. She majored in biology and
was accepted into nursing school, but she has put that on hold to
pursue soccer. After college, she spent a year in Japan playing
soccer professionally.
</P>
<P>
   ``I went to the national camps and tried out for the US team in
1992 and 1995, but didn't make it,'' said Hill, 29. ``I knew my
chances of making the team were non-existent. Then, when I got this
opportunity, I took it.''
</P>
<P>
   Hill, whose mother was born in Mexico City, said a law recently
passed enables second-generation family to become naturalized
Mexicans, which made her eligible for the Mexican team. The team,
in fact, has seven Mexican-Americans on its roster.
</P>
<P>
   When the team was playing in the same league as her club, in
Berkeley, she played with them. ``So that was my tryout.''
</P>
<P>
   She made the team, and in February represented Mexico in the
FIFA World All-Star match.
</P>
<P>
   Hill said she realizes that she's playing for a country in which
women's soccer has never gone to the Olympics, and where coach
Leonardo Cuellar says there's a ``macho man'' mentality about the
game.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're really breaking ground right now,'' said Hill, who
likens her experiences to what the American women were going
through a dozen years ago.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was talking to some of the US players, and when they first
started they were washing their uniforms in the hotel sink,'' she
said. ``That's what we've done this year. So the support could be
better, but it's a gradual step. It's better than it was six months
ago. When we first started, we didn't have a team doctor or a
trainer.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Sure, it's frustrating at times, but adversity builds
character,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Hill, who worked on a search-and-rescue team and two years ago
traveled solo through Guatemala to learn Spanish, said she's up for
the challenge. In fact, she savors it.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think of it as kind of fate for me,'' she said. ``I'm
someone who like to be different, likes to be challenged, and
that's how I see this experience. I mean it's a challenge, but
that's when you learn the most, about yourself, about others. It's
when you step out of your comfort zone and really push yourself
that you learn, and that's how I see this experience.''
</P>
<P>
   The other challenge will be if she faces the US team, which
would happen only if both teams reach the quaterfinals.
</P>
<P>
   That's OK, too, said Hill, who said she's known US midfielder
Julie Foudy ``for about 15 years.''
</P>
<P>
   But Hill said she's happy on her side of the field.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wouldn't trade it for playing on the US team right now,
because I'm learning more,'' Hill said.

AMON CARTER 2001: FORT WORTH ART MUSEUM TO CLOSE FOR EXPANSION
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JANET TYSON 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   FORT WORTH, Texas _ The Amon Carter Museum, a cornerstone of
Fort Worth cultural life and tourism, will close Aug. 1 for more
than two years so that an addition can be built that more than
triples its exhibition space, museum officials have announced.
</P>
<P>
   Designed by Philip Johnson, architect of the Carter's core 1961
building, the roughly 85,000-square-foot addition requires
demolition of all but the original building, with its commanding
view of downtown Fort Worth. The museum will re-open in fall 2001 _
a year before the new Modern Art Museum of Fort Worth opens two
blocks away.
</P>
<P>
   In the meantime, museum staff, archives, library and educational
services will be housed in a temporary facility in west Fort Worth.
Many key artworks from the collection will be placed on loan to the
National Gallery of Art in Washington, the Museum of Fine Arts in
Boston and the Sid Richardson Collection in Fort Worth, among
others, officials said.
</P>
<P>
   Additionally, the Carter will rent space downtown for gallery
displays and a small museum shop.
</P>
<P>
   The cost of the project is estimated at $36 million _ including
demolition, construction and operation of the new facility, and
temporary off-site facilities. Museum trustees are developing a
capital fund-raising campaign that will include support by the Amon
G. Carter Foundation.
</P>
<P>
   With partner Alan Ritchie, the 93-year-old Johnson ``has
designed a remarkable expansion of the original building ... a
labor of love,'' said museum President Ruth Carter Stevenson who,
with her late brother, Amon G. Carter Jr., commissioned Johnson to
design the original memorial to their newspaper-publisher father.
</P>
<P>
   ``Once and for all, in the fall of 2001, we can open our doors
and say, `Here is a collection of American art, second to none,
housed in a beautiful building, in exciting spaces, in Fort Worth,
Texas,''' Stevenson said.
</P>
<P>
   Since its inauguration as the Amon Carter Museum of Western Art,
the Carter's collection has expanded in numbers and purview _ from
400 works by Frederic Remington and Charles Russell to about
300,000 works reflecting a panoramic view of American culture and
history from the early 19th century through the present.
</P>
<P>
   The need for additional space to exhibit the collection, as well
as special loan exhibitions, has been critical for several years.
Many works from the permanent collection have never been shown, and
the museum's staff has declined to host a number of touring
exhibitions because there wasn't room to present them.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's fair to say we will be able to show four times the art,''
said Robert Workman, the Carter's assistant director.
</P>
<P>
   The exterior of the new building will be clad in brown granite
slabs that will contrast with the cream-colored shellstone of the
1961 structure and its portico entrance.
</P>
<P>
   Its flat roof will feature what Johnson calls a ``vaulted
lantern,'' a broad, low-profile skylight covered by bronze-finished
metal, with windows on all four sides. The lantern caps a two-story
atrium, walled with shellstone, that becomes a major junction for
traffic inside the museum.
</P>
<P>
   On the main level, the new entrance will be on the museum's
south side, facing the Fort Worth Museum of Science and History.
The museum store and auditorium will be located there. Visitors
will be able to walk through the atrium to the main floor of the
Carter's original building where the downstairs galleries will
display Amon G. Carter's collection.
</P>
<P>
   Visitors also will have access to the atrium stairs or nearby
elevators to get to the second floor and its new galleries, and to
reach the mezzanine galleries of the original building.
</P>
<P>
   ``The expansion is about the Carter, but it's also about the
Carter in light of developments at the other museums,'' said Doug
Harman, president of the Fort Worth Convention &AMP; Visitors Bureau.
``It's all part of making Fort Worth one of the most important and
dramatic museum cities in the country.
</P>
<P>
   ``The two-year wait will be worth it.''

NHL PLAYOFFS IN THE FROZEN . . SOUTH? 
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
   Greensboro.
</P>
<P>
   Greensboro?
</P>
<P>
   This is hockey? This is the Stanley Cup playoffs? We should be
talking about one of those long-lost rinks like Montreal Forum,
Maple Leaf Gardens, the Aud, or Chicago Stadium.
</P>
<P>
   The Bruins are going to North Carolina for their first round of
the 1999 playoffs. Thursday night _ in a gym made famous by David
Thompson, Len Elmore, Tom Burleson, and John Lucas _ the B's and
Carolina Hurricanes will begin a best-of-seven joust.
</P>
<P>
   The Greensboro Coliseum was just about perfect when it served as
permanent site of the Atlantic Coast Conference basketball tourney,
but it's been a hideous hideout for the Artists Formerly Known as
Hartford Whalers.
</P>
<P>
   That's right, folks. These Hurricanes had the wisdom to do what
Robert K. Kraft certainly will do very soon: bolt from Hartford.
Until two years ago, the 'Canes were the Forever .500 Whalers,
skating endlessly toward mediocrity in the cold heart of America's
File Cabinet.
</P>
<P>
   They moved to Carolina in 1997-98 and have just completed their
second season in their temporary home in Greensboro. When the
1999-2000 season opens, the 'Canes are scheduled to be playing in
their shiny new rink in Raleigh.
</P>
<P>
   Greensboro is less than an hour's drive from ACC kingpins North
Carolina, Wake Forest, Duke, and North Carolina State. This is
great for college basketball, but useless when trying to sell
tickets for NHL games. (The inside of Greensboro Coliseum is
adorned with a giant black curtain that hides the empty seats in
the highest level.) Hurricanes owner Peter Karmanos is expecting
things to change when he moves into the spanking-new Raleigh
Entertainment and Sports Arena next fall.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, the 'Canes are in the playoffs, and Greensboro is the
site. Wonder what they're saying about this in Mount Pilot?
</P>
<P>
   Shazam! Can we expect to see Gomer, Goober, Aunt Bea, and Ernest
T. Bass in the cheap seats at Greensboro? Do any of these folks
even know that the Bruins are part of the NHL's Original Six?
</P>
<P>
   Doubtful.
</P>
<P>
   On the surface, hockey in North Carolina is no dumber than
hockey in Anaheim, Tampa, Dallas, Nashville, San Jose, Phoenix, or
Los Angeles. The National Hockey League was not adequately
supported in Minneapolis, Winnipeg, or Quebec City, where mucking
in the corners is part of everyday life.
</P>
<P>
   In this spirit, league officials are mining American cities with
bustling incomes. Raleigh (``Best Place to Live'' _ Money Magazine)
was chosen, and it was determined that two years in Greensboro, 80
miles from Raleigh, would be better than two more seasons in
Hartford while the new arena was built.
</P>
<P>
   Carolina-Boston. This is quite a matchup. James Taylor should
drop the ceremonial first puck. Sweet Baby James spent considerable
time in both regions. He sang about snow on the Massachusetts
Turnpike ``from Stockbridge to Boston,'' and going to ``Carolina in
my mind.''
</P>
<P>
   Think about it. Carolina is tobacco road. Boston is the home of
smoke-free restaurants and workplaces. They gave us Cedric Maxwell
and Trot Nixon. We gave them Dave Cowens _ for a while. They gave
us draft picks that yielded Sergei Samsonov and Kyle McLaren. We
gave them Glen Wesley. They had Sam Ervin. We had Sam Adams. They
have George Shinn. We have John Harrington. And remember that the
estimable Peter Gammons went from Groton School to the University
of North Carolina (Chapel Hill) to the Globe.
</P>
<P>
   They gave the world Michael Jordan. We gave the world John F.
Kennedy. They have Outer Banks. We have Georges Bank. They had the
Wright Brothers. We had the Bulger Brothers. They have TV sheriff
Andy Taylor. We have TV barkeep Sam Malone. They have Cape
Hatteras. We have Cape Cod. They have Winston-Salem. We have Salem.
They have Wilmington. We have Wilmington.
</P>
<P>
   We share the Appalachian Trail.
</P>
<P>
   In the end, it won't be about any of this. This is the NHL
postseason tournament and the team with the hot goalie will win.
Still, those datelines are going to look funny. The Bruins are in
the playoffs and they are going to Greensboro, N.C.

 By NANCY L. MARRAPESE  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON -- Pat Burns has three moods at the rink. Grumpy,
grumpier, grumpiest.
</P>
<P>
   Away from hockey, the Bruins coach is charming, funny, colorful,
and a gifted storyteller, covering subjects such as the Hell's
Angels, his love of Harley Davidsons, and his days as a former beat
cop in his native Quebec.
</P>
<P>
   When he is in a hockey environment, though, Burns narrows his
dark eyes, wears a perpetual frown, and, in looks and manner, is
utterly in charge.
</P>
<P>
   And when the Bruins are playing well, watch out.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know this _ he's at his grumpiest after we win,'' said
president/general manager Harry Sinden, chuckling. ``He's able to
dismiss a loss, analyze it and go on. When we win, I think he's
worried we'll lose it between now and the next game. I don't go
down (to the dressing room) when we win.''
</P>
<P>
   In truth, some of Burns's grouchy demeanor is a mask, donned for
effect. There are times when he'll snap at one person, then wink at
the next one he sees. His mood is very much a tool in a large and
deep toolbox.
</P>
<P>
   Sinden, whose team opens its first-round Eastern Conference
playoff series against the Hurricanes in Carolina Thursday night,
enjoys his conversations with the coach, who like most pro bench
bosses has dual personalities. The two have discussed every
possible subject, outside of hockey and in.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's a real game-face, game-day guy,'' said Sinden. ``He's a
very interesting person.''
</P>
<P>
   Ask Burns about anything from politics to fishing to the
internet to travel, and he will tell you a story.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've had lots of nights like that with him and he's good
company in those times,'' said Sinden. ``Then, there are other
times, I keep my distance.''
</P>
<P>
   Such is the lot of the professional coach. The pressure can be
suffocating, the hours long, the tenure short, the blame plentiful,
and the credit sparse. When the Bruins were struggling in late
January into early February, Burns told his wife, Line, to take a
vacation.
</P>
<P>
   ``Go have fun,'' Burns told her, because at that time, with the
team in an 0-6-2 skid, no one around the club was enjoying much of
anything. Holdouts and injuries had prevented Burns from having a
full lineup until that point in the season.
</P>
<P>
   Boston finished the 82-game schedule with the exact same record
as last year _ 39-30-13. But Burns has had to work harder at it
this season. Much harder.
</P>
<P>
   In 1997-98, there were plenty of unknowns on the young, unproven
club. Few had heard of Hal Gill or P.J. Axelsson. No one knew how
good Sergei Samsonov was going to be or that Jason Allison was
going to have a breakout year. No one knew that Byron Dafoe was
capable of joining the elite class of netminders. What was known
was that Burns was a good coach.
</P>
<P>
   This year, he's had to be even better.
</P>
<P>
   ``Last year went very smoothly,'' Burns said. ``We didn't have
too many problems. It was harder this year. It changes your life
around a little bit because you're taking it more home than you are
usually. Often you'll sit there and people are talking to you and
you don't hear them. My wife will be talking to me and she'll say,
`You're not listening to me.' And I'll say, `You're right, I'm
not.' It's because your mind is churning all the time.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
----- &QC; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   There was a time when Sinden, too, didn't consider Burns a very
good listener. He would talk to the coach about the games, about
players' performances, about this line or that line.When he
received no response, he thought his analysis was falling on deaf
ears.
</P>
<P>
   ``Terry O'Reilly was a bit like that in that I could talk to him
about different subjects and he'd be listening without
responding,'' said Sinden. ``But you never know. Now that I know
Pat, I might have had some of those doubts, not doubts so much, but
wonderings on whether he was hearing me or not when I first met
him. There are so many things later on that he comes back and said,
`Do you see this now that we talked about?' And I said, `Yeah.'
</P>
<P>
   ``So he was listening and didn't do it or he was listening and
did do it. I talk to him quite often and he doesn't comment on a
lot of subjects but he's listening. He sorts it out, throws it out,
keeps it or whatever.''
</P>
<P>
   Burns said he is like Detroit coach Scotty Bowman in that he's
open to the opinions of concessionaires, ticket takers, janitors,
reporters, fans, and yes, even his boss. He processes all the
information and then uses what in his judgment will most help the
team succeed.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sometimes he feels I'm not listening but I am listening,''
said Burns. ``He has a way of saying it that's maybe different than
anybody else but what he says is constructive. I maybe don't always
react to it. I'll think about it and churn about it.
</P>
<P>
   ``I do certainly listen because I know he's been there.''
</P>
<P>
   Burns said the ultimate responsibility rests with him because he
makes the decisions.
</P>
<P>
   ``It takes a while to get to know me,'' said Burns. ``I'm not a
one-man show. I listen to everybody but I'll take what I feel is
important because I feel I'm on the firing line. I have the
decisions to make. I have a fraction of a second to make a
decision. That's what I like about Harry. Harry has been there. He
knows. He's had to make those decisions. Maybe he didn't make the
right one that time or made a good one. I'm not saying I make all
the right decisions. He's the best GM I've ever had for that
because he's been there. (Former Montreal GM Serge Savard) was
never there, (former Toronto GM Cliff Fletcher) was never there.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
----- &QC; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Burns has been compared to Bill Parcells, and there are
similarities. Both are whip smart, know how to play the media like
a violin, and are among the very best at what they do. The hallmark
of both is instant credibility.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's got a lot of respect from a lot of people,'' said right
wing Rob DiMaio. ``He's hard, he's tough, he's a very smart hockey
man. He has passion for the game, and wanting to win is probably
the biggest thing. He's never satisfied with what we're doing. We
can always do more, and for a young hockey team, those are the
right ingredients for success.
</P>
<P>
   ``He knows how to get the most out of his players. He's got a
great system that fits this team real well. He's definitely been
the biggest influence in changing the feeling of the Boston Bruins
and making us a contender again.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's the final say in how this team is run and I think that's
a big step to get the respect of the players, knowing that what he
says is actually going to happen. Whether that's fear or I'm not
sure what it is, upper management knows that and I think they lay
off him and let him do his thing.''
</P>
<P>
   His thing involves being part pop psychologist, part father
figure, part taskmaster, part tactician. If anything has changed
from his first year to this one, Burns said, it has to do with his
players getting a tad too comfortable.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's human nature,'' he said. ``They're going to try
something. You always try something. The first year, you don't try
nothing because you're scared of him, thinking, `Is this guy crazy?
The second year, they'll try to get around something to see.
Anybody who works in any kind of business, when there's a new boss,
everybody's got their ears propped up. The second year, they say,
`Let's see what happens if I try this.' ''
</P>
<P>
   Sinden said the strongest part of Burns's repertoire is his
ability to convince all the players to stay on the same page.
</P>
<P>
   ``I haven't seen too many stray dogs,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
----- &QC; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Burns said he couldn't change now even if he wanted to, and he
doesn't want to. Experience has taught him the best way to evaluate
his personnel, and his years on the police force taught him to
trust his instincts.
</P>
<P>
   ``You have guys who want to be better, there are other players
who will not be better no matter what they do,'' he said. ``You see
more things in practice than you do in a game. You see the
character of the player, you see how his habits are, on the ice and
off, his working habits, if he's liked by the team. That part is
trying to identify who's still on board and who maybe you're
wasting your time with.''
</P>
<P>
   Pro coaching is a lonely job with a short shelf life. It's
fraught with headaches, literal as well as metaphorical. It's the
quickest route to high blood pressure. Relaxing is not an option
and Burns doesn't even try.
</P>
<P>
   ``You're never satisfied as a coach,'' said Burns. ``You're
never, never happy. If you're ever content, your team will be
content. If your team is content, you're done.
</P>
<P>
   ``We haven't won nothing up to now. Don't get me wrong. I want
them to feel good. I want to be happy and to like each other. I
want them to feel proud but I don't want them to feel like they've
accomplished anything yet.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a real fine line. Coaching is where you have to keep 24
guys happy. It's impossible. That's the toughest, to keep 24 guys
on board and happy.''
</P>
<P>
   He's earned his grumpiness.

MANCHESTER UNITED BOSS MISLEADS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By FRANK DELL'APA  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   There is no doubt that Rupert Murdoch can afford to purchase
Manchester United Football Club, at any price. But his offer of
more than $1.06 billion was recently blocked by Trade and Industry
Secretary Stephen Byers, leaving the club to scrape through.
</P>
<P>
   The news was embraced by fans who had set up opposition to
Murdoch, fearing the soul of the club would be diluted by such a
massive sale. So Manchester United remains quite profitable and
supporters still have a voice in the proceedings.
</P>
<P>
   But this is a time of potential turning points for the rich
clubs. The goals of quality soccer combined with fan involvement
and maximizing profits are clashing at higher levels.
</P>
<P>
   In England and Scotland, supporters' attachment to clubs remains
strong enough to overwhelm even the greatest of profiteers. And
since every city has at least one viable club, team directors and
owners cannot use the US-style blackmailing threat to move teams.
</P>
<P>
   Unfortunately, Martin Edwards, the Manchester United director
who would profit most from a Murdoch takeover, is painting a gloomy
future for the team. He expects only one reinforcement, a
replacement for Danish goalkeeper Peter Schmeichel.
</P>
<P>
   ``We thought with the backing of one of the world's most able
media companies we could have underpinned our domestic position and
increased our ability to do more than just challenge for European
honors,'' Edwards wrote in Sunday's match program for United's 3-0
win over Sheffield Wednesday. ``We believe the `silent majority' of
United fans were supportive of the bid _ we certainly know that
supporters of other clubs were delighted that our plans were
thwarted.''
</P>
<P>
   Edwards's statement seems petulant. Manchester United has a
chance for ``The Triple'' _ Premiership, FA Cup, and European
Champions League titles. It is difficult to feel sorry for him.
</P>
<P>
   Unless Manchester United collapses on the field in the next
month, the club will have had a glorious season.
</P>
<P>
   Ryan Giggs, who scored a dramatic tying goal in the 92d minute
of the first leg, then made the difference against Arsenal in the
FA Cup semifinal replay, watched Saturday's game on crutches. Then,
the News of the World tabloid reported that his brother, Rhodri
Giggs, 21, has been selling cocaine and prostitutes through an
apartment rental agency in London, using Ryan as an unwitting
accomplice.
</P>
<P>
   Despite some heavy promotion by a US-based apparel company, Ryan
Giggs has not attained the stature he might deserve on the global
stage. He will not likely ever play in the World Cup, since Wales
has not qualified for the finals since 1958.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Juventus has been rejuvenated by the arrival of coach
Carlo Ancelotti and a classic left wing of its own, Frenchman
Thierry Henry. During a 3-1 victory over first-place Lazio, Henry
scored his first two goals of the Serie A season.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike Giggs, Henry arrived with little publicity. Henry scored
three goals in the 1998 World Cup finals, but he kept a low profile
compared with his veteran teammates.
</P>
<P>
   And with Juventus, he has been unsettling defenses with his
exceptional speed and now seems to be developing the finishing
instinct.
</P>
<P>
   The son of immigrants from the Caribbean island of Guadaloupe,
Henry, 21, grew up in Les Ulis, in the western banlieues of Paris,
a symbol of the changing face of French society _ half of the World
Cup champion team were first-generation immigrants from Africa, the
Caribbean, and Polynesia _ a dignified riposte to the National
Front xenophobes.
</P>
<P>
   Bayern Munich is favored to advance in the other semifinal after
tying Dynamo Kyiv, 3-3, in the Ukraine capital in the first leg.
</P>
<P>
   At least the Ukrainians left their mark on the competition.
Crowds of 100,000-plus filled their Olympiyskyi Stadium for the
quarterfinal elimination of defending champion Real Madrid and the
Bayern Munich game. The team was selected by entering data for
prospective players into a computer, which matched players to
positions, determining optimum characteristics. Though a colder
basis for choosing a team could not be conceived, the Kyiv club has
produced a joyful, skillful, risk-taking style that belies its
microchip origins.
</P>
<P>
   Striker Andriy Shevchenko, 22, will join Milan next year, and
will likely return to the Champions League since Milan has pulled
within a point of Serie A leader Lazio. And Dynamo Kyiv is likely
not finished since only two of its players are as old as 30.

NATO PARTY TRANSFORMS INTO A WAR COUNCIL 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (w and i coding)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MARY LEONARD  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ NATO's 50th birthday party has a lot of people
singing the blues.
</P>
<P>
   Starting at the top, Secretary of State Madeleine K. Albright
and national security adviser Samuel Berger in somber tones Tuesday
recast the celebration scheduled long ago for this weekend in
Washington as a nothing-but-work war summit over NATO's deepening
crisis in Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   Further down the White House command chain, Richard Socarites,
the official in charge of three days of luncheons, dinners,
meetings, press conferences, and making the motorcades of no fewer
than 44 world leaders run on time, laments that ``as a social
event, this summit is turning out as a bust.''
</P>
<P>
   Forty-two law enforcement agencies in the Washington area face
an unprecendented security assignment that was stressful to begin
with and only got worse when NATO started bombing Yugoslavia.
``We're prepared for anything,'' said Kenneth Piernick, an FBI
counterterrorism specialist, ``from simple assaults to weapons of
mass destruction.''
</P>
<P>
   And as for Washington tourists, here by the tens of thousands at
the height of the spring-vacation season, the red carpet rolling
out for NATO VIPs means a long weekend of frustration: airport
delays, traffic gridlock, closed museums, no White House tours, and
six square blocks of the capital cordoned off from anybody without
a special pass.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're going to hate me,'' said Karina Ferguson, a tour guide
anticipating the reaction of visitors when she tells them, come
Friday, it's Mount Vernon, George Washington's home in northern
Virginia, or nothing.
</P>
<P>
   Nobody is underestimating the significance of this NATO summit.
What could have been a predictable weekend of windy speeches,
self-congratulation, splendid parties, and an effusive welcome to
NATO's three newest members, Hungary, Poland, and the Czech
Republic, has suddenly switched to a strategic war council on
Kosovo that will test the alliance's mettle.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had planned a summit that focused a bit on the past and a
great deal on the future . . . but now it is necessary to have it
and to focus intensely on the present as well,'' Berger said at a
White House briefing Tuesday. ``Now this is going to be a working
meeting of a military alliance in the middle of a conflict.''
</P>
<P>
   The logistics of the summit were already daunting: How to greet,
move, protect, lodge, and entertain the heads of state, prime
ministers, and hundreds of other foreign dignitaries from 19 NATO
countries and as many as 25 NATO-affiliated nations. Consider, for
example, that diplomatic protocol demands the NATO leaders arrive
in alphabetical order (by country, English spelling) at a White
House dinner for 800 on Saturday night.
</P>
<P>
   Now, at the last minute, NATO officials have ripped up the
program and are improvising. The opening ceremony Friday morning
has been replaced by a three-hour meeting on Kosovo. A military
parade has been canceled, and an emergency session on humanitarian
aid may be held Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   A commemoration will take place Friday in the same Constitution
Avenue auditorium where the North Atlantic Treaty was signed 50
years ago, but NATO has nixed a warplane flyover as inappropriate.
</P>
<P>
   With images of bleak, Balkan refugee camps fresh on TV screens,
NATO also scratched black-tie events and anything not fitting a
theme of ``simple, serious, and dignified,'' said Socarides, a
special assistant to President Clinton and the summit's chief
operating officer. ``More work, less pomp and circumstance.''
</P>
<P>
   That's not to say socializing has been eliminated entirely. In
addition to the White House dinner in a tent on the South Lawn, the
president and Mrs. Clinton will greet guests at a more exclusive
party Friday evening, and Mrs. Clinton will host two luncheons for
VIP spouses. The cost of the summit, shared by the US government
and corporate sponsors, will be about $25 million.
</P>
<P>
   As Washington events go, the size of this summit is small with
about 5,000 attendees, including 3,000 journalists. (The Federation
of American Societies for Experimental Biology brought more than
11,000 conventioneers to the capital this week.) But in scale _ in
catering and floral arrangements, in fleets of limousines required,
in mobile phones in use, and certainly in security _ this is the
mother of all Washington weekends.
</P>
<P>
   The Secret Service is in charge of security, and it is leaving
no manhole or mailbox unsealed, no rooftop unguarded, no airspace
unpatrolled, no biological threat unchecked. To control the summit
area, the Secret Service is restricting the six square blocks
around Federal Triangle to NATO traffic only, and it has required
nine of the Smithsonian museums to close Friday.
</P>
<P>
   The District of Columbia will shut down its government and
public schools Friday, and 90,000 federal bureaucrats will get that
day off too, with pay.
</P>
<P>
   ``You have to assume there is a very high threat level,'' said
Chuck Vance, a Secret Service veteran who now runs a private
security firm in Washington.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have lived here 19 years, through some huge events on the
Mall and several presidential inaugurations, but I don't recall
anything like this,'' said Marie Tibor, vice president of the
Washington Convention and Visitor Association. ``If a rolling
motorcade excites you, this is the time to be here. For anyone
else, it presents a true challenge.''

   MIAMI _ There's a hurricane brewing in the Caribbean, but it has
nothing to do with wind or rain.
</P>
<P>
   Caribbean leaders are outraged by a British government proposal
to restore full citizenship to its 13 remaining colonies, from the
Pacific to the Caribbean -- at a price.
</P>
<P>
   Britain has ordered the island commonwealths to ditch the death
penalty and bans on homosexuality, and to tighten regulation of
offshore banking, the lifeblood of islands such as Bermuda.
</P>
<P>
   The colonies are to bring their laws into line with British
practice by the end of the year.
</P>
<P>
   And if the colonies' local governments do not comply, Britain
will change their laws for them.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are committed to seeing it done,'' said British Foreign
Secretary Robin Cook.
</P>
<P>
   Cook unveiled the proposal before the British Parliament on
March 17 after months of wrangling over the citizenship issue. The
Parliament is expected to vote on the plan within weeks.
</P>
<P>
   Cook said the move would end the ``strong sense of grievance''
felt in the territories since their citizenship rights were taken
away by the Thatcher government in 1981.
</P>
<P>
   But in the Caribbean, a region that's historically religious and
conservative, the demand to legalize homosexual acts, in
particular, has incited controversy.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier this month, the community affairs minister in the Cayman
Islands, Julianna O'Connor-Connolly, said the Cayman Islands had a
``mandate from God'' to retain its ban on gay sex.
</P>
<P>
   ``We abide by the views of the vast majority of Caymanians who
live in a Christian community based on firmly held religious
beliefs that homosexuality should not be legalized,'' the
government said in a recent statement.
</P>
<P>
   The homosexuality question became a hot-button issue last year
when the Cayman Islands prohibited an American cruise ship carrying
some 900 gay men from making a one-day stop there.
</P>
<P>
   Later anti-gay activists in Jamaica protested against a
scheduled performance by the Village People, a six-member band that
became gay icons in the late 1970s, causing the group to cancel
their concert.
</P>
<P>
   All this prompted U.S. gay and lesbian groups to boycott some
islands -- including the Caymans and Jamaica -- citing blatant and
widespread discrimination.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've continued to put pressure on these islands because we've
received reports of gay travelers feeling harassed in certain
places,'' said Augustin Merlo, executive director of the
International Gay &AMP; Lesbian Travel Association in Fort Lauderdale,
Fla.
</P>
<P>
   Islands have often found themselves torn between their
conservative cultures and a desire to attract tourism dollars from
gays and lesbians who represent a $47.3 billion travel market.
</P>
<P>
   Cornelius Smith, tourism minister in the Bahamas, said most
Caribbean islands welcome gay tourists, although anti-homosexual
sentiments shouldn't come as a surprise in a region where churches
are often more pervasive than bars.
</P>
<P>
   In the Bahamas, which is not a British colony but where
homosexuality is also illegal, one pastor has helped organize a
Christian group called Save the Bahamas that plans to lobby for
stricter sodomy laws as well as a ban on gay cruises.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is often said that when the United States sneezes, the
Caribbean catches the flu, so when morals decline in the United
States, they decline here,'' said Vaughn Miller, pastor of Nassau's
Resurrection Tabernacle Church.
</P>
<P>
   ``Obviously we don't want that to happen,'' he added.
</P>
<P>
   David Smith, senior strategist with the Human Rights Campaign, a
Washington-based gay and lesbian lobbying group, said he is stunned
by discrimination in the Caribbean and that ``recalcitrant
protectorates'' were acting outside the mainstream.
</P>
<P>
   ``Such discrimination against an entire group of people is
egregious,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, the conservative American Family Association has
applauded the resolve of Caribbean islands that won't bend to
British demands.
</P>
<P>
   It is urging its 350,000 supporters in the May issue of the
association's magazine to contact the British Embassy in Washington
to voice dissatisfaction with the government's proposal.
</P>
<P>
   The Tupelo, Miss.-based organization was the first to promote a
Disney boycott after Disney-owned studios produced such sexually
controversial movies as ``Priest'' and ``Pulp Fiction.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Britain can do what it wants, but we don't have to agree with
it, so what we're doing is encouraging travelers to spend their
tourism dollars in places other than England,'' said Allen Wildmon,
director of public relations for the American Family Association.
</P>
<P>
   Britain's controversial plan would restore full citizenship
rights revoked in 1981 for colonies as far-flung as Anguilla in the
Caribbean to St. Helena halfway between Africa and South America to
the Pitcairn Islands in the Pacific.
</P>
<P>
   Back then, fearing vast migration among Hong Kong's 6.4 million
people ahead of the island's handover to China, Britain made people
in the colonies ``British subjects,'' stripping them of the
automatic right to live and work in Britain.
</P>
<P>
   The change will give colonial residents ``the right to travel
freely throughout the European Union, and will enable their young
people to support themselves through work experience while they
study in Britain,'' Cook said.
</P>
<P>
   The proposal is particularly welcome in Montserrat, where most
of the island's 12,000 residents were evacuated due to an active
volcano.
</P>
<P>
   But in the British Virgin Islands, Chief Minister Ralph O'Neal
said London's demands smack of ``a form of imperialism.''
</P>
<P>
   He said he has no plans to scrap the death penalty. Rather he
wants to extend it to include drug traffickers.
</P>
<P>
   Bermuda -- the oldest and wealthiest of the colonies -- has been
the most vocal in its opposition to the proposal, with some
residents suggesting independence.
</P>
<P>
   The island of 61,000 people has denounced what it sees as
Britain's attempt to threaten its tax haven status.
</P>
<P>
   Bermuda has grown rich by encouraging offshore banking, an
industry that's been criticized for both its secretive rules and
for laundering illicit drug profits.
</P>
<P>
   ``We need a referendum to decide whether or not the country
wants to be tied to the United Kingdom,'' said former Premier
Pamela Gordon. ``If not, then the only choice would be
independence.''

   MIAMI _ There's a hurricane brewing in the Caribbean, but it has
nothing to do with wind or rain.
</P>
<P>
   Caribbean leaders are outraged by a British government proposal
to restore full citizenship to its 13 remaining colonies, from the
Pacific to the Caribbean -- at a price.
</P>
<P>
   Britain has ordered the island commonwealths to ditch the death
penalty and bans on homosexuality, and to tighten regulation of
offshore banking, the lifeblood of islands such as Bermuda.
</P>
<P>
   The colonies are to bring their laws into line with British
practice by the end of the year.
</P>
<P>
   And if the colonies' local governments do not comply, Britain
will change their laws for them.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are committed to seeing it done,'' said British Foreign
Secretary Robin Cook.
</P>
<P>
   Cook unveiled the proposal before the British Parliament on
March 17 after months of wrangling over the citizenship issue. The
Parliament is expected to vote on the plan within weeks.
</P>
<P>
   Cook said the move would end the ``strong sense of grievance''
felt in the territories since their citizenship rights were taken
away by the Thatcher government in 1981.
</P>
<P>
   But in the Caribbean, a region that's historically religious and
conservative, the demand to legalize homosexual acts, in
particular, has incited controversy.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier this month, the community affairs minister in the Cayman
Islands, Julianna O'Connor-Connolly, said the Cayman Islands had a
``mandate from God'' to retain its ban on gay sex.
</P>
<P>
   ``We abide by the views of the vast majority of Caymanians who
live in a Christian community based on firmly held religious
beliefs that homosexuality should not be legalized,'' the
government said in a recent statement.
</P>
<P>
   The homosexuality question became a hot-button issue last year
when the Cayman Islands prohibited an American cruise ship carrying
some 900 gay men from making a one-day stop there.
</P>
<P>
   Later anti-gay activists in Jamaica protested against a

 &HT;    PORK BARREL POLITICS IN ISRAEL: SOVIET IMMIGRANTS PIVOTAL IN
ELECTIONS
 &HT;    700&AMP;ADD
 &HT;    With Photo.
 &HT;    By LARRY KAPLOW 
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service 
<TEXT>
<P>
   ASHKELON, Israel _ As a middle-aged deli worker who's skeptical
of politics, Tatiana Vilansky seems like an unlikely king maker.
</P>
<P>
   She lives in a land of Hebrew speakers, but talks politics in
her native Russian. On the job, she serves up pork salami in a
country where pork is shunned by religious customs and, in some
cases, official law.
</P>
<P>
   But the 45-year-old immigrant from Belarus is in demand because
she has not decided who she prefers in Israel's upcoming elections.
Political activists have called on her about five times, as hungry
for her vote as her customers are for her sliced ham.
</P>
<P>
   That is because, as their numbers swell, Vilansky and other
immigrants from the former Soviet Union might decide the future of
Israel's leadership. Though the bulk of the Russian immigrants
favor Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, candidates see a large
slice of the immigrant vote is still up for grabs, are trying to
suit their tastes on everything from the peace process to the
question of just how Jewish Israel should be.
</P>
<P>
   The vote, for parliament and prime minister, is May 17. A June 1
runoff is likely in the prime minister's race. The so-called
Russian voters (they come from Russia and other former Soviet
republics) are key.
</P>
<P>
   ``By all means, the Russians are important for the elections,''
said Vilansky's boss, Riva Kalichman, 50, an immigrant from
Moldavia. ``There are many of us and we have power.''
</P>
<P>
   After just eight years of heavy immigration, people from the
former Soviet Union now number more than 1 million of Israel's 6
million population. They are still arriving at a rate of more than
4,000 a month and they make up more than 15 percent of the voters.
</P>
<P>
   They have already changed Israel.
</P>
<P>
   Former Soviet dissident Natan Sharansky, now Minister of Trade
and leader of a political party for immigrants, says that the
influx doubled the number of engineers, teachers and scientists in
Israel.
</P>
<P>
   Many delight in Russian treats like pork chops and vodka. They
read more than 15 local Russian newspapers and watch television
beamed directly from Russia. They have formed four of their own
political parties.
</P>
<P>
   They backed Yitzhak Rabin when he won in 1992 and Netanyahu when
he won in 1996. Polls show over 50 percent of them still favoring
Netanyahu, known by his nickname ``Bibi.''
</P>
<P>
   In Ashkelon and Ashdod, neighboring coastal cities with more
than 80,000 immigrants from the former Soviet Union, voters
announce their choice in Russian -- ``Dah (yes) Bibi'' -- and wear
ball caps with Russian letters stating, ``Vote for Benjamin
Netanyahu.'' Most like him for his reluctance to hand land over to
the Palestinians.
</P>
<P>
   But polls also show 20 percent of the immigrants undecided,
double the rate among other sectors of Israel. The more than
100,000 at stake is triple Netanyahu's victory in 1996.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the last elections we knew how to vote, but this year we
are in a dilemma,'' said Marina Solodkin, one of six Soviet
immigrants in the Israeli parliament.
</P>
<P>
   For starters, the immigrant community is changing. Of the more
than 820,000 arrived since 1990, more than 150,000 are new since
the last elections in 1996.
</P>
<P>
   In general, both groups have had trouble finding jobs to match
their skills and have been disappointed with Israel's schools.
</P>
<P>
   They are also angry at government policies that require rigorous
documentation of their Judaism in order to qualify for legal
marriages and burials in Israel. They complain of discrimination by
police.
</P>
<P>
   But, their political desires are still enigmatic. Solodkin says
her party polls weekly to find out what its voters want.
</P>
<P>
   They seem to be savvy and open-minded, but still view Israel's
mainstream Labor Party, headed by candidate Ehud Barak, as
reminiscent of the detested socialists from their homelands. They
don't like Israel's religious hardliners, but support a Netanyahu
government that gives the ultra-Orthodox great influence.
</P>
<P>
   The common denominator seems to be land. Tiny Israel is barely
as large as the Moscow region alone and immigrants don't want it to
get smaller, as it likely will under the Oslo peace process.
</P>
<P>
   ``They are real hawks. They are against the peace process,''
said Mina Tsemach, an Israeli pollster. ``For the first time in
their lives the have their own territory. It belongs to them and
they don't want to return it.''
</P>
<P>
   (EDs: Story can end here. Optional add begins.)
</P>
<P>
   Sharansky said the Russians will vote for their own immigrant
parties for parliament, hoping to address their domestic concerns.
Then, they will vote for security and the right-wing for prime
minister.
</P>
<P>
   But, Sharansky's own party has stayed neutral on the prime
minister's race, refusing to endorse his boss, Netanyahu. He says
there is opportunity for Barak or Center Party candidate Yitzhak
Mordechai.
</P>
<P>
   Attempting to seize on that, Barak earlier this week hinted that
he would appoint a Soviet immigrant to run the country's interior
ministry, the ministry that carries out the controversial policies
on immigration and religious identification.
</P>
<P>
   In his comments, Barak noted that he recently shared Passover
dinner with a Jewish immigrant soldier from Russia whose mother was
expelled from the country apparently because she was not Jewish.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Netanyahu has courted Russian voters via their
homeland, Russia. Though he has long urged the United States to
sanction Russia on suspicion that it aids weapons programs in Iran
and Iraq, Netanyahu recently traveled to Moscow seeking to mend
fences.
</P>
<P>
   The about-face irked American officials, but not as much as
Foreign Minister Ariel Sharon's comments questioning the wisdom of
the U.S.-led NATO bombing of Yugoslavia, a position apparently
aimed at Russians in Israel.
</P>
<P>
   In a home for immigrant senior citizens in Ashdod, the move did
not impress Eliana Kurnina, a 66-year-old from Moscow. She called
Sharon's statements a ``pre-election trick,'' adding, ``He needs
the Russian voters.''
</P>
<P>
   But she said she will still vote for Netanyahu.

<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Elizabeth Tilberis, 51, editor-in-chief of Harper's
BAZAAR since 1992, died Wednesday after a long fight with ovarian
cancer.
</P>
<P>
   A well-respected and powerful force in the fashion community,
Tilberis helped raise public awareness of the disease and worked to
raise funds for a cure.
</P>
<P>
   Tilberis was diagnosed with ovarian cancer in 1993, during the
height of her magazine career, while she worked in the center of
the glamorous world of international fashion. A year after she was
hired by Hearst Magazines to revitalize one of the world's fashion
bibles, Tilberis underwent major surgery and chemotherapy.
</P>
<P>
   ``The vision Liz had for Harper's BAZAAR was to set the agenda
for modern elegance,'' said Frank A. Bennack, Jr., president and
CEO of The Hearst Corporation. ``She not only achieved her vision,
but her optimism and passion for living every day to the fullest
were admired by all who knew her. We will miss this force in
fashion and this remarkable woman.''
</P>
<P>
   Cathleen P. Black, president of Hearst Magazines, said that
Tilberis' ``instincts and eye for fashion, fashion photography, and
style were unparalleled. She will be remembered as one of the
magazine industry's greatest 20th century talents. And for those of
us who were lucky enough to work with her, her passion and love for
life were inspirational.''
</P>
<P>
   Apart from her role as editor, Tilberis served as president of
the Ovarian Cancer Research Fund, Inc., a position she held since
1997.
</P>
<P>
   Tilberis is being awarded the annual Humanitarian Award by the
Council of Fashion Designers of America (CFDA) for her memoir, ``No
Time to Die,'' published by Little, Brown &AMP; Company in 1998.
</P>
<P>
   When she began her career at British Vogue as fashion editor in
1974, Tilberis exhibited a forward-thinking style and a gift for
working with photographers. She later served as executive fashion
editor (1984), editor-in-chief (1987) and director of Conde Nast
Publications (1991).
</P>
<P>
   In 1992, Tilberis was named editor-in-chief of Harper's BAZAAR,
the year which marked the magazine's 125th anniversary. Her
editorial debut with the September issue, featuring Linda
Evangelista on the cover, brought Tilberis a new level of
international recognition. Fashion and beauty photography was at
the core of BAZAAR.
</P>
<P>
   She introduced more art features and high-quality fashion
journalism. Her impressive editorial team included Creative
Director Fabien Baron and Fashion Director Tonne Goodman.
Internationally renowned fashion photographers Patrick DeMarchelier
and Peter Lindbergh also joined her staff.
</P>
<P>
   Tilberis is survived by her husband of 28 years, Andrew, and
their two sons Christopher, 14 and Robert, 17; her mother, Mrs.
Thomas (Jane) Kelly; sister, Lois Stuart-Black; and her brother,
Dr. Grant Kelly.

17 elections for prime minister and parliament. The Russians a re a
complex group, highly educated, cultured, and secular. In Ashkelon,
they have several Russian newspapers, their own political
leadership and butchers who flout kosher laws against pork
products. Coming from the largest country in the world, they are
apprehensive about turning over any of tiny Israel to the Arabs and
that's why, in 1996, two-thirds voted for Benjamin Netanyahu. But
they are said to be unpredictable and looking for alternatives.

   NATIONAL
</P>
<P>
   SCHOOL-CHOICE _ The 40,000 tuition grants being given nationally
to poor kids to opt out of public schools is a lot like an
initiative in Atlanta begun in 1992. We'll focus on a mother and
two daughters who received these scholarships and talk about that
parents in this program, while they appreciate it, didn't use it to
get a vastly better education, used it instead to get a very
religious education at unaccredited schools. So if this scholarship
program is to show that we should have tax-funded vouchers, the
move to religious school raises constitutional problems with mixing
church and state and changes the very nature of public education
from a public good to a private commodity. (Cumming, Atlanta

Consumers League shows one easy way people can save money and help
the Earth: Buy 10 common things, like soft drinks, cereal and
pasta, in the least massive containers (i.e. cereal in bags instead
of boxes). Waste reduction promises to hit home even harder, as
cities go to various pay-as-you-throw schemes, which charge
homeowners based on the amount of garbage they produce. (Atlanta

   WASHINGTON _ Will the war in Kosovo become another Vietnam?
After barely a month of bombing Yugoslavia, it is far too soon to
make such analogies.
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, there is a widespread fear that the two sides will
be caught in a cycle of escalation, as occurred in Vietnam. As
awful as Kosovo is now, the odds of a long-term tragedy will be far
greater if we don't apply the lessons the Vietnam conflict taught
us.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, my great concern is that we and our adversaries may
have already made mistakes that might have been avoided had we
learned from experience. Studying the lessons of Vietnam may allow
us to end this war earlier; ignoring them may result in
catastrophe.
</P>
<P>
   Over the past four years, a number of us from the Kennedy and
Johnson administrations, and some of America's top scholars, have
been involved in an unprecedented series of dialogues with North
Vietnamese officials. Our task: to identify missed opportunities,
if any existed, to avoid the war altogether or to terminate it
before it became a tragedy that claimed the lives of more than 3.5
million Vietnamese and more than 58,000 Americans.
</P>
<P>
   Our dialogues revealed many dimensions of mutual
misunderstanding, some of which may resemble the current tragedy in
the Balkans. Indeed, there are some alarming parallels, as well as
some important distinctions.
</P>
<P>
   For example, in Vietnam each side miscalculated by repeatedly
underestimating the costs and risks its adversary was willing to
accept. The failure of the United States to anticipate the almost
incredible losses absorbed by Vietnamese Communists, both north and
south, is well known.
</P>
<P>
   But we learned in our dialogues that the North Vietnamese were
prepared to absorb far greater punishment than was ever delivered
by the American bombing. Likewise, the Hanoi government, in a
series of disastrous miscalculations made from 1961 to 1965,
repeatedly underestimated America's willingness to prosecute the
war in the South on the ground, and in the North via the bombing.
</P>
<P>
   In Vietnam neither side understood the bottom line of the other
with regard to how South Vietnam should be governed, by whom and
for how long. Each side, American and Vietnamese, discovered during
the course of our dialogues that its former adversary was much more
open to negotiations _ to a neutral, coalition government in Saigon
_ than was believed at the time.
</P>
<P>
   The point is this: These mutual misjudgments were not
preordained by some process of escalation that, as is implied by
many who see the Balkans through the prism of Vietnam, was beyond
human control. Both the Americans and Vietnamese in the dialogues,
who for the first time had access to one another's real intentions
at the time, concluded that many opportunities existed along the
way for leaders to do what they should have done _ lead! _ rather
than ignore the Vietnam crisis in slow motion.
</P>
<P>
   There is at least one lesson from Vietnam that can be applied
immediately. A Pentagon Papers-like project should already be under
way within the U.S. government so that historians will have the
adequate raw material to identify the missed opportunities on the
road to the Balkans War.
</P>
<P>
   It is not always easy to constructively draw lessons from
history. Indeed, many in the Balkans have used history and the
lessons they draw from it to justify the carnage we have seen over
the past several years.
</P>
<P>
   We may be drawing the wrong lessons from Vietnam, too, if we
believe that we should avoid ground troops at all costs or avoid
applying military force in support of political or diplomatic ends.
All the more reason to reconsider Vietnam and begin our
consideration of what has happened in the Balkans.
</P>
<P>
   This century has been the bloodiest in history. Over 160 million
human beings have been killed in various conflicts, and that number
rises each day. It is a dark history, but unless we look at it and
seek to learn from it, it will only get darker.
</P>
<P>
   My views are in no way meant to be critical, but I am not at all
sure that we have learned from experience, and I worry that we will
end up making the same mistakes again and again. It was once
famously said that the United States did not have 10 years of
experience in Vietnam, but one year of experience 10 times over.
Will we say the same about the Balkans?
</P>
<P>
   &UR; (Robert S. McNamara was secretary of defense in the Kennedy and
Johnson administrations. He is the author, with James Blight,
Robert Brigham, Thomas Biersteker and Col. Herbert Schandler, of
``Argument Without End: Searching for Answers to the Vietnam
Tragedy.'') &LR;

 FROM: The New York Times Magazine  
 For release: April 18 or thereafter  
 Editors: See THE LOCAL ANGLE box below  
 &HT;    __  The Bible as civic blueprint ... John Winthrop and the `City
on a Hill'  __
 &HT;    
 &HT;    To consider the most influential sermon of the second Christian
millennium is, for most of us, to think of those larger-than-life
preachers who enjoy a modest immortality in the anthologies and
surveys of American history, literature and religion.
 &HT;    Chief among them is probably Jonathan Edwards, whose sermon
``Sinners in the Hands of an Angry God'' was imposed upon
generations of high school students as an example of Puritan
preaching. Unfortunately, with a single stroke, that sermon has
perhaps managed more than any other to ruin the reputations both of
Puritanism and God.
 &HT;    Today's students of America's ongoing culture wars might point
to Harry Emerson Fosdick's 1923 sermon, ``Shall the Fundamentalists
Win?'' as the defining word in the conflict between liberals and
conservatives for America's soul. And there is not a person alive
today who has not heard, at least in part, Martin Luther King's
1963 elegy on the American dream uttered at the foot of the statue
of Abraham Lincoln.
 &HT;    These three all have their claims upon the American imagination,
but in naming the best sermon of the last 1,000 years, my vote is
for none of them.
 &HT;    Instead, when I think of a definitive sermon I turn to that
formative moment in 1630, when the layman Robert Winthrop, governor
of the Massachusetts Bay Colony, preached to his fellow immigrants,
while still at sea aboard the ship Arbella.
 &HT;    ``Christian Charity: A Model Hereof,'' is what Winthrop called
his sermon, and it would have languished in obscurity, known only
to an elite class of Puritan scholars, were it not for its
felicitous use of a biblical image _ that of the ``city set on a
hill'' _ to describe the moral purpose of the Pilgrims' adventure
into the unknown.
 &HT;    That image, familiar to generations of Christians from Jesus'
``Sermon on the Mount'' in Matthew's gospel, is what gave
Winthrop's sermon life, while also giving a new context to
Matthew's text.
 &HT;    And it provided perhaps the most enduring metaphor of the
American experience, that of the exemplary nation _ the ``city on a
hill'' _ called not to prosperity and private gain but to virtue
and mutual support.
 &HT;    Indeed, when in 1961 John Fitzgerald Kennedy addressed the
Massachusetts legislature as its favorite son and president-elect,
he, son of a different collection of immigrants to the New World,
cited Winthrop's sermon as the text for his new administration.
Ronald Reagan, as Garry Wills reminds us, adopted Winthrop's vision
as his own, with a little help, of course, from speechwriter Peggy
Noonan.
 &HT;    Both Gandhi and Abe Lincoln have been claimed as the moral
tutors for Martin Luther King's ``I Have A Dream,'' his ringing
ideal of the American experience. But I would argue that it was
Winthrop's sermon that was the rhetorical ancestor of King's finest
oration.
 &HT;    True, by standards of contemporary preaching, Winthrop's sermon
is long, argumentative and complex, qualities that give preaching a
reputation for tediousness. It does not read like an inspirational
tract, and there is no appeal to cheap emotion or sensation.
 &HT;    It reads like a lawyer's brief, actually; Winthrop was a lawyer
trying to make the best possible case for the legitimacy of the
Puritan enterprise. He did this on the basis of a new Christian
conscience upon which would be founded a new social contract, the
likes of which the world had not yet seen.
 &HT;    Winthrop's idea of civic virtue was derived not from secular
models of political economy but from the biblical principles of
justice and mercy: ``There are two rules whereby we are to walk one
towards another: justice and mercy.'' These were not abstract
virtues, but social necessities if, in fact, the mixed society of
poor and rich over which he presided was not to fracture into
self-interest groups.
 &HT;    In a less than ideal society, one which Winthrop and his
co-religionists would have understood as fallen, these virtues were
essential to mutual survival and prosperity. And if Massachusetts
was to be an improvement upon experience, the whole of society and
not just the church must be animated by them.
 &HT;    Some have argued that the Puritan ideals of Winthrop were naive
and utopian, suited only for a religious fantasy world of the weak
and like-minded. But what runs through his sermon is a painfully
honest realization of the powerful seductions of self-interest and
ambition.
 &HT;    It is Winthrop's sense of sin that animates his plea for civic
virtue. He understood that a rampant individualism was as dangerous
to the common good as the familiar threats of peril, famine and
pestilence.
 &HT;    When he asks, ``What rule must we observe and walk by in cause
of community peril?'' he answers his own question, ``The same as
before (justice and mercy) but with more enlargement towards others
and less respect toward ourselves.'' And he cites examples of the
primitive church which sold all and held everything in common:
``Neither did any man say that which he possessed was his own.''
 &HT;    Mutuality was the cohesive principle: ``This sensibleness and
sympathy of each other's condition will necessarily infuse into
each party a native desire and endeavor to strengthen, defend,
preserve and comfort the other.''
 &HT;    Having established mutual love as the model of Christian
charity, he summarizes the object of the enterprise: ``The end is
to improve our lives, to do more service to the Lord, the comfort
and increase of the body of Christ whereof we are members, that
ourselves and posterity may be the better preserved from the common
corruptions of this evil world to serve the Lord and work out our
salvation under the power and purity of his holy ordinances.''
 &HT;    Any other course would cause the shipwreck of the new society.
The only way to prevent such a disaster was to ``Follow the counsel
of Micah, to do justly, to love mercy, and to walk humbly with our
God.
 &HT;    ``For this end we must be knit together in this work as one man,
we must entertain each other in brotherly affection, we must be
willing to abridge ourselves of our superfluities. For the supply
of others' necessities we must uphold a familiar commerce together
in all meekness, gentleness, patience and liberality; we must
delight in each other, make others' conditions our own, rejoice
together, mourn together, labor and suffer together, always having
before our eyes our commission and community in the work ...''
 &HT;    This seems an impossible task for mere human beings. It had not
worked before, and the eyes of the world would look with cynical
interest for the failure of such a noble ambition: ``We shall be as
a city set on a hill, the eyes of all people upon us.''
 &HT;    But failure would be failure for all time, Winthrop intoned, and
so success was the only moral option. The choice was between new
life and old death, and the choice was obvious.
 &HT;    Ending his sermon with the appeal of Joshua to the Israelites as
they stood on the brink of the promised land, Winthrop concludes:
``Therefore, let us choose life, that we and our seed may live by
obeying his voice and cleaving to him, for he is our life and our
prosperity.''
 &HT;    Winthrop's is a layman's vision for a new civil body politic.
Even today, that vision still lives and awaits its fulfillment. A
sermon that is as powerfully relevant to the future as it was at
the moment of its utterance, nearly four centuries ago, and whose
impact can be measured across the nation-states of the world,
deserves not only to be remembered but to be regarded as the
prophetic utterance that it was, and is.

<P>
   Has there been in the last thousand years a single best time to
be alive? In this age of faith in progress, it's easy to answer
quickly: Yes, right now. But does that almost automatic response
stand up to informed comparison with past times?
</P>
<P>
   To answer this question, The New York Times Magazine convened a
panel, moderated by the longtime New York Times columnist Russell
Baker, comprising the following scholars:
</P>
<P>
   _ Thomas Cahill, author of ``The Gifts of the Jews'' and ``How
the Irish Saved Civilization.''
</P>
<P>
   _ Ann Douglas, professor of English and comparative literature
at Columbia, and author of ``Terrible Honesty: Mongrel Manhattan in
the 1920s.''

of ``The Origin of Satan.''
</P>
<P>
   _ Orlando Patterson, professor of sociology at Harvard, and
author of ``Rituals of Blood: Consequences of Slavery in Two
American Centuries.''
</P>
<P>
   _ Jonathan Spence, professor of history at Yale, and author of
``The Chan's Great Continent: China in Western Minds.''
 &UR; -0- &QL;
</P>
<P>
   RUSSELL BAKER: None of us are living in this time by choice.
We're here because of somebody else's decision. Maybe, given our
druthers, we would prefer to be somewhere else _ I would bet in
most cases not in the future. The idea is to debate a little about
the ideal time to live in, if you had your own choice.
</P>
<P>
   I suppose some people would say this is the ideal time. I'm
prepared to argue against that, but for the most part I'm here to
listen to your opinions. Mr. Spence, you would probably like to go
back in time?
</P>
<P>
   JONATHAN SPENCE: Absolutely. I would be very interested to live
my life in Hangzhou. I know where my villa is going to be: on the
west side of the lake in the hills, looking down on what was then a
totally unpolluted lake, and what was a kind of large and
prosperous rural pleasure resort. A beautiful city.
</P>
<P>
   BAKER: What year is it on the Christian calendar?
</P>
<P>
   SPENCE: I would be born around 1540. One of the problems here is
I'd like to have a bit of money. I don't want too much, because the
official agents from Beijing would take it away from me. This was
one of the most urbane and cultured times in all of Chinese
history.
</P>
<P>
   I've always studied the Manchu Dynasty and modern China and the
revolution, and that was from 1644. But I would like to live in the
Ming Dynasty _ not knowing, of course, that the Ming was going to
fall. So I do need to die shortly before 1644. That was a great
time of scholarship, and it was also a great time for scholarship
for women.
</P>
<P>
   If it's all right, I want to be married to my real-life wife at
the same time, but my Chinese language would be much better in this
life. As a couple, we're always going to be able to play elegant
poetry games, word games that the Chinese have always loved to
play.
</P>
<P>
   And the reading _ the texts about that 16th-century period in
Hangzhou show an amazingly energized society. People read very
widely. It's a magnificent period in painting. The food is
magnificent. It is not a slave society. Booze is available but not
excessive. It's pre-opium, no heavy narcotics. And the distribution
of food in that region is efficient. It was a rich time to live.
</P>
<P>
   BAKER: It sounds like a paradise. How about you, Mr. Cahill?
</P>
<P>
   THOMAS CAHILL: Sticking within the confines of the last thousand
years, I find myself drawn to the 14th century. I would love to
have gone to a Christmas party in medieval London with Geoffrey
Chaucer. I would love to have been around when Giotto began to
paint _ this man, influenced by the spiritual realism of Francis of
Assisi, asking himself: What do human beings really look like? And
then trying to make them in that way. I would love to have been
there when Joan of Arc began to muster the troops.
</P>
<P>
   BAKER: They burned her.
</P>
<P>
   ELAINE PAGELS: I think that this would be a fascinating journey,
but I'd want to go with a full set of inoculations and an American
passport.
</P>
<P>
   CAHILL: How long do you want to be present?
</P>
<P>
   BAKER: Since this is an intellectual exercise, I think you have
to assume that you're going to be part of the culture of the time.
We'd all like to cruise around and watch Columbus come ashore.
</P>
<P>
   CAHILL: I find it difficult to reduce myself to one spot.
</P>
<P>
   DOUGLAS: But we all are reduced to one spot. And you'd live how
long? Thirty years in about 1390? You'd hardly have time to get
around to see everything you said you wanted to see.
</P>
<P>
   SPENCE: In Hangzhou, there were long-lived people, maybe 90 year
olds, edging 100. They also had wonderful food, which didn't even
require teeth! Delicious rice pilaf dishes, soft lotus-root dishes.
</P>
<P>
   BAKER: Mr. Patterson?
</P>
<P>
   ORLANDO PATTERSON: I chose three periods, excluding the period
following the civil rights movement in America. That has obviously
been the best time for Afro-Americans, but sticking to it would rid
the discussion of any fun. Working backward, my third choice would
have been to be a moderately prosperous New England farmer who
lived around 1750 to 1830 _ embracing the Revolutionary period.
</P>
<P>
   I would have been about 26 in 1776, so I would have fought in
the Revolutionary War. I would like to have had the opportunity to
talk intellectually with Madison, to club with Hamilton, to tell
Jefferson what a fraud I thought he was _ that really, it's not
fair that he should have a place in history just because he wrote a
great paragraph.
</P>
<P>
   My second choice is to have lived in Tokugawa, Japan, about the
18th century. I would not want to have been a samurai. By then,
they were no longer warriors; they were basically quasi
bureaucrats. And I wouldn't particularly care for the official
culture that the shogun imposed, although it was quite fascinating
_ those tea ceremonies. They would have been far too restrictive
for me.
</P>
<P>
   I would like to have been a moderately prosperous merchant
around the 1730s, participating in what the Japanese call the
floating world, which is a kind of counterculture to the official
world imposed by the shogunate. They had a ball!
</P>
<P>
   I'd have been drawn to Kabuki dramas, to the fashion, to the way
they subverted the official ideology so that when the shogun said,
``You can no longer wear fancy clothes; you have to wear cotton if
you're a merchant,'' they wore cotton on the outside and silk on
the inside.
</P>
<P>
   I think the life expectancy may well have been much better
living in Japan at that time than in Europe. And it was a very
peaceful period. They threw out the Europeans and were able to
develop their own culture.
</P>
<P>
   Now I come to my first choice. It's in the 14th century. It's a
city-state that produced some of the most beautiful art in the
world. Can you guess?
</P>
<P>
   PAGELS: Siena?
</P>
<P>
   PATTERSON: No. I wouldn't want to be in Renaissance Italy if you
paid me. There were towns where a third to a half of the population
was dropping dead from the plague!
</P>
<P>
   The little city-state I had in mind would have been the town of
Ife in Yorubaland, in what's now western Nigeria, somewhere about
the mid-to-late 14th century. I would want to have been a sculptor,
one of the people who produced those incredible bronze heads or the
terra-cotta work that you now can see in the British Museum. Again,
the life expectancy would have quite possibly been higher than for
a working man in Europe at that time.
</P>
<P>
   It would be nice to have been a bourgeois gentleman in Holland
during the golden 17th and early 18th centuries, having your
portrait done by one of their great painters, but they were
involved with the slave trade. The same was true of the British.
</P>
<P>
   You think about being an entrepreneur in late 18th- and
19th-century England. You saw this incredible transformation, the
Industrial Revolution; the steam engine and all the rest. The
trouble is, one can't help thinking about the plight of the
displaced masses and the kids who were being sent down into the
mines.
</P>
<P>
   BAKER: I wonder if I could change the focus to the idea of
progress. Do we all believe in progress?
</P>
<P>
   SPENCE: It seems to me it's not so much comfort or progress that
we're talking about; it's those who actually are drawn to live in a
period of extraordinary change and struggle vs. those who, I think,
want a period of enormous cultural subtlety and development.
</P>
<P>
   I tilt toward the latter, a time in which the culture is still
immensely lively, but the idea of progress would not exactly be the
point.
</P>
<P>
   CAHILL: I would speak for progress. We are at the end of the
bloodiest of all centuries, to be sure. And it is not a universal
consciousness, by any means, but I think there is a consciousness
of the necessity for peace.

 Attention: Idaho, Minnesota, North Dakota  
 &HT;    ___  Forget electricity, the microchip and the car. Without
legumes, we wouldn't have made it out of the Dark Ages. 
 &HT;    
 &HT;    It is hard to determine a century's most important technological
invention or scientific discovery, not least because our ideas of
the date of a given invention are not clear. There are many things
that readers would list among the most interesting achievements of
this century, when in fact they date from the century before ours:
the automobile, for example, and the skyscraper, the subway, the
dynamo, the turbine.
 &HT;    You can also add the typewriter, the gramophone, the dictaphone,
the sewing machine, the refrigerator, as well as canned foods,
pasteurized milk, the cigarette lighter (along with the cigarette),
the elevator, the washing machine, the eraser, blotting paper, the
electric fan, the safety razor, the Murphy bed, the barber's chair,
the safety match, the raincoat, the safety pin, carbonated
beverages, bicycles with gears and pneumatic tires, the electric
tramway, synthetic fibers and great department stores to sell all
this stuff and _ if I may continue _ electric light, the telephone,
the telegraph, radio, photography and moving pictures.
 &HT;    Furthermore, a calculating machine was invented that could
perform numerous additions in one minute, setting us firmly on the
path toward the computer.
 &HT;    Now rewind to the Middle Ages before the year 1000 A.D. This era
can deservedly be called the Dark Ages because the barbarian
invasions that took place beset Europe for centuries and gradually
destroyed Roman civilization. Cities were deserted, in ruins; the
great highways, neglected, disappeared under a tangle of weeds; and
fundamental techniques were forgotten, including the processes of
mining and quarrying. The land was no longer cultivated and, at
least until the feudal reform of Charlemagne, entire agricultural
areas reverted to forest.
 &HT;    In this sense, the Middle Ages before 1000 A.D. were a period of
indigence, hunger, insecurity. As the population became smaller and
less strong physically, people were mowed down by endemic diseases
(tuberculosis, leprosy, ulcers, eczema, tumors) and by dread
epidemics such as the plague.
 &HT;    It is always risky to venture demographic calculations for past
millennia, but according to some scholars, Europe in the seventh
century had shrunk to roughly 14 million inhabitants; others posit
17 million for the eighth century. Underpopulation combined with
undercultivated land left nearly everyone undernourished.
 &HT;    As the second millennium approached, however, the figures
changed _ the population grew. Some experts calculate a total of 22
million Europeans in 950; others speak of 42 million in 1000. In
the 14th century, Europe's population hovered between 60 million
and 70 million. Though the figures differ, on one point there is
agreement: In the five centuries after the year 1000, Europe's
population doubled, maybe even tripled.
 &HT;    The reasons for Europe's boom are hard to pinpoint; between the
11th and 13th centuries, radical transformations occurred in
political life, in art, in the economy and, as we shall see, in
technology. This new surge of physical energy and of ideas was
evident to those living at the time.
 &HT;    Naturally it can be said that, with the reforms of Charlemagne,
with the construction of the Germanic empire, with the rejuvenation
of cities and the birth of the communes, the economic situation
also improved. But would it not also be possible to say the
opposite, namely that the political situation evolved, the cities
flourished anew, because daily life and working conditions were
improved by something?
 &HT;    In the centuries before 1000, a new triennial system of crop
rotation was slowly adopted, allowing the land to be more fruitful.
But cultivation requires tools and working animals, and on this
front there were breakthroughs too.
 &HT;    Just before the year 1000, horses began to be fitted with iron
horseshoes (up until then, the hooves were bound with cloth) and
with stirrups. The latter, of course, were more for the benefit of
knights than for peasants.
 &HT;    For the peasants, it was the invention of a new kind of collar
for horses, oxen and other beasts of burden that proved
revolutionary. The old collars put all the strain on the animal's
neck muscles, compromising its windpipe. The new collar involved
the chest muscles, increasing the animal's efficiency by at least
two-thirds, and permitting, for certain tasks, horses to replace
oxen (oxen were better suited to the old type of collars, but they
also worked at a slower pace than horses). In the past horses had
been yoked in a horizontal line, now they could be yoked in single
file, significantly increasing their capacity for pulling.
 &HT;    Around this time, plowing methods changed. Now the plow had two
wheels and two blades, one for cutting the earth and the other _
the plowshare _ for turning it over. Though this ``machine'' was
already known to Nordic people as early as the second century B.C.,
it was not until the 12th century that it spread throughout Europe.
 &HT;    But what I really want to talk about is beans, and not just
beans but also peas and lentils. All these fruits of the earth are
rich in vegetable proteins, as anyone who goes on a low-meat diet
knows, for the nutritionist will be sure to insist that a nice dish
of lentils or split peas has the nutritional value of a thick,
juicy steak.
 &HT;    Now the poor, in those remote Middle Ages, did not eat meat,
unless they managed to raise a few chickens or engaged in poaching
(the game of the forest was the property of the lords). And as I
mentioned earlier, this poor diet begat a population that was ill
nourished, thin, sickly, short and incapable of tending the fields.
 &HT;    So when, in the 10th century, the cultivation of legumes began
to spread, it had a profound effect on Europe. Working people were
able to eat more protein; as a result, they became more robust,
lived longer, created more children and repopulated a continent.
 &HT;    We believe that the inventions and the discoveries that have
changed our lives depend on complex machines. But the fact is, we
are still here _ I mean we Europeans, but also those descendants of
the Pilgrim Fathers and the Spanish conquistadors _ because of
beans.
 &HT;    Without beans, the European population would not have doubled
within a few centuries, today we would not number in the hundreds
of millions and some of us, including even readers of this article,
would not exist. Some philosophers say that this would be better,
but I am not sure everyone agrees.
 &HT;    And what about the non-Europeans? I am unfamiliar with the
history of beans on other continents, but surely even without
European beans, the history of those continents would have been
different, just as the commercial history of Europe would have been
different without Chinese silk and Indian spices.
 &HT;    Above all, it seems to me that this story of beans is of some
significance for us today. In the first place, it tells us that
ecological problems must be taken seriously. Secondly, we have all
known for a long time that if the West ate unmilled brown rice,
husks and all (delicious, by the way), we would consume less food,
and better food.
 &HT;    But who thinks of such things? Everyone will say that the
greatest invention of the millennium is television or the
microchip. But it would be a good thing if we learned to learn
something from the Dark Ages too.

<P>
   ``These guys don't want to quit,'' said Henckel, who has a small
room inside the Compaq Center equipped with a table, light and
medical kit for dental emergencies. ``They're absolutely infatuated
with the game. It doesn't matter what the injury is; they just want
you to stitch 'em, numb 'em and get 'em back out there. You
wouldn't believe it.''
</P>
<P>
   Like the time former Aeros player Bill Bowler got his face
smashed into the boards by an opponent after a play had ended. A
guy came up and _ bam! _ checked him right into the wall, knocking
out two front teeth. After controlling the ``bleeding situation,''
as Henckel diplomatically put it, he gave Bowler a shot of Novocain
and sent him back out. Right away, Bowler slammed his stick hard
into the guy's face.
</P>
<P>
   ``That threw him out of the game, but he didn't care at that
point,'' Henckel said. ``All he wanted was retaliation.''
</P>
<P>
   Which brings up the inevitability of dental injuries in ice
hockey, intentional and otherwise. It's like ham and eggs. If
you're going to play, you're going to lose a tooth, probably
several, said the good dentist. All those sticks, all those pucks,
all those big, hyperventilating men. ...
</P>
<P>
   Henckel said he tries and tries to get his players to use their
mouth guards, but some of them _ around 40 percent _ just won't do
it. It interferes with their breathing, they tell him.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm called in about every third or fourth game,'' said
Henckel, whose wife carries a pair of binoculars to games to alert
him of dental events before he's even paged on the intercom.
``Actually, I'm amazed at how infrequent the injuries are, with all
those sticks being slung around.''
</P>
<P>
   Ken McRay, assistant coach for the Aeros, said there's not one
player on the current team who has retained all his original teeth
(except for goalies, who wear wire mesh masks).
</P>
<P>
   ``It's just part of the game,'' said McRay, who lost his four
front teeth during a game against the Quebec Nordiques in the
big-time National Hockey League. On the upside, he said, his caps
``look better than my real teeth.''

   Henckel became the team's dentist when the Houston Aeros,
currently Southwest Division champs and part of the International
Hockey League, formed five years ago. (An earlier Houston Aeros
team played in the '70s under the auspices of the now-defunct World
Hockey Association.) He happened to be the dentist of Dr. Charles
Baker, head doctor of the Aeros medical team. But he was also
well-suited for the complexities of the job, he said, having
rotated through a variety of specialities during the Army _ oral
surgery, periodontal work, and so on.
</P>
<P>
   A low-key sort who hasn't tried to bank off his status as a
celebrity sports-dentist, Henckel has seen his already-flourishing
practice grow from his association with the Aeros, mostly through
routine dental care he provides to the players' wives and kids.
When he treats the team's sports-related injuries, he gets paid
(though not much, he mentions) through players' workers'
compensation insurance.
</P>
<P>
   He's not the only medical person on staff at ice hockey games. A
veritable battalion of doctors _ internist, orthopedist,
ophthalmologist _ stand by to treat the inevitable injuries.
</P>
<P>
   Which on occasion can involve spectators zonked by high-flying
pucks. Henckel has never ministered to a downed spectator (Compaq
Center has its own paradmedics for that, he said), although he did
once see a lady get bonked between the eyes.
</P>
<P>
   ``I checked, and there wasn't anything wrong with her mouth,''
he said.

THE PUCK STOPS HERE: DENTIST TAKES A BITE OUT OF HOCKEY INJURIES

<P>
   HOUSTON _ Sore gums? Toothache? Broken fillings?
</P>
<P>
   You think you've got problems. Try taking a hockey puck at 90
mph on those bright-and-shinies.
</P>
<P>
   That's what happened two years ago, when a puck intended for the
Houston Aeros' goal inadvertently wound up in former player Carl
Valmont's mouth instead.
</P>
<P>
   Then-goalie Troy Gamble witnessed the whole thing.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was really gross,'' he said. ``He basically ate the puck.
He fell right away. ... Then he got up and skated off with a
towel.''
</P>
<P>
   He remembers wondering why trainer Jerry Meins was on his hands
and knees on the ice.
</P>
<P>
   ``Then I realized: he was looking for teeth. And he found them.
Two big front ones.''
</P>
<P>
   Gamble saw the teeth again the following week, when Valmont had
them proudly displayed in a glass jar at his home.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't realize teeth were so long,'' Gamble mused. ``There's
so much tooth up inside the gum.''
</P>
<P>
   Aeros left wing Jeff Christian has his own toothsome tales. As a
rookie in Canada, he lost two front teeth to a puck. A dentist
installed a permanent bridge. Next season, the bridge got knocked
out by a stick. Now he wears a removable bridge, making him a hit
at watermelon seed spitting contests.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'd say it's like getting whacked in the mouth with a
hammer,'' Christian said of his close encounters of the puckish
kind.
</P>
<P>
   When it comes to contact sports, ice hockey is as gnarly as it
gets. Bloody and aggressive, the action is fast, furious and in
your face. Tempers frequently fly, as do fists, sticks and pucks.
</P>
<P>
   In other words, it's not tennis.
</P>
<P>
   So when the guys on the ice take a hit to their pearly whites,
they rely on Houston Aeros team dentist Don Henckel to stand in the
gap. Handy with a cap or crown, always up for a root canal, Henckel
attends all the Aeros home games, where he's ready to rescue
free-floating choppers and return them to the tender gums of
thankful hockey players.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are so fortunate to have him,'' said Gamble, now retired
and a color commentator for the team. ``Even if it's loose, Doc
Henck's philosophy is always to try and save the tooth.''
</P>
<P>
   As the Aeros enter the playoffs, one of the busiest men in
dentistry said that overall the team's dental health is ``pretty
good, except for a few cavities here and there.''
</P>
<P>
   In private practice since 1968, Henckel is a polite, serious,
quietly cordial man. Handsome, with snowy-white hair and a ruddy
complexion, he looks like one of those grandfatherly doctors in an
HMO pamphlet. Sitting in his multiroom dental complex, he's full of
tooth (make that toothless) stories.
</P>
<P>
   ``That was really devastating,'' said Henckel, recalling
Valmont's unorthodox oral-handling of a hockey puck. ``There wasn't
any possibility of ever re-implanting those teeth. They were gone.
All the bone around them was gone as well.''
</P>
<P>
   In that case, Henckel _ who has bushy eyebrows, one of which
lowers when he talks, giving him an earnest, Lloyd Bridges look _
had to rebuild Valmont's ``arch.'' That's the bony ridge where the
teeth go in. Henckel reconstructed it with synthetic materials so
the subsequent bridge would sit right in Valmont's face, and he
wouldn't scare people in bus stations.
</P>
<P>
   Then there was that Long Beach player who took a puck to the
jaw.
</P>
<P>
   ``It knocked out one of his lower teeth; the other four were
just waving there,'' said Henckel, who provides dental care to
opposing teams when they're on Houston turf. ``You could move them
very easily. We re-implanted the one that came out and wired the
other ones back in.''
</P>
<P>
   Most of the time, though, injuries are more minor _ a chipped
tooth here, the occasional exposed nerve or broken molar there _
leaving Henckel and wife Patricia to enjoy the game and their hot
pretzels in the stands. His most common procedure is injecting a
tooth-challenged player with anesthesia, letting him back on the
ice.

 &HT;    YUGOSLAV SHELLING OF ALBANIA BORDER TOWNS ACCELERATES
 &HT;    With KOSOVO-MAIN.
 &HT;    With photos.

<P>
   KRUME, Albania _ Accelerated shellings and explosions aimed by
Yugoslavia's military at this craggy border region are raising
fears for the safety of Kosovo refugees, aid workers and local
Albanians.
</P>
<P>
   The blasts have killed 17 Kosovo guerrilla fighters and forced
the evacuation of an entire village. They also are interfering with
humanitarian aid deliveries for thousands of refugees crammed into
a tent camp and the homes of local Albanians.
</P>
<P>
   The series of cross-border attacks appears to be directed at
training camps of the Kosovo Liberation Army (KLA) guerrillas.
</P>
<P>
   ``One shell landed right there up on the hill,'' said Avni Dita,
a plain-clothes police investigator, pointing to a spot overlooking
this town.
</P>
<P>
   He said shells or mortars buffeted a village not 15 miles to the
west, and the nearly 1,000 residents all were evacuated. Local
television reported that a Yugoslav military unit then crossed over
the border and looted the village, which held a KLA headquarters.
</P>
<P>
   Another explosion in the Krume area, this one of unknown origin,
forced the UN World Food Programme(CQ) to halt helicopter
deliveries of food and other aid, according to agency spokesperson
Angela Walker. She said food now travels here by truck from Kukes,
near the main refugee border crossing about 18 miles southeast of
Krume.
</P>
<P>
   ``We can't afford helicopter accidents,'' Walker said in an
interview in Kukes.
</P>
<P>
   The KLA set up camps throughout this border area to continue
their fight for Kosovo's independence from Yugoslavia.
International negotiations failed when the Serbian-led Yugoslav
government refused to agree to a settlement accepted by the KLA,
leading to the NATO bombing of Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, the Serbs intensified their campaign to end
the independence movement and drive out most if not all of the 1.8
million ethnic Albanians in Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   So far the Serb aggression has not convinced Kosovar Albanian
refugees here or elsewhere along the border to move further south,
much to the consternation of relief agencies. They are trying to
relocate these concentrations of people for their own safety and to
make room for the huge new influx of refugees arriving daily at
border crossings.
</P>
<P>
   ``We want to stay here,'' said Shahe Dallaveri, 47, who has
lived in the tent camp on Krume's outskirts for two weeks. ``I can
think only of the hospital where I have my wounded children. We
just want to get back.''
</P>
<P>
   The Dallaveri family left three children across the border in
Kosovo. They said two were wounded when Serbs opened fire on their
refugee convoy trying to exit the country. A third, who is 20 years
old, stayed behind to care for her wounded siblings in a hospital,
according to the mother.
</P>
<P>
   ``Maybe they (Serbian Yugoslavs) are trying to get revenge
against Albanians because they are helping us,'' said Ramadan
Dallaveri, 61, the husband of Shahe.
</P>
<P>
   Humanitarian workers have expressed concern that the local
populace will grow impatient with this refugee presence and the
stress they are bringing to the area, including the Serbian
shelling campaign. That is another reason they are urging refugees
to disperse to southern regions wher they would be less
concentrated.
</P>
<P>
   At least some Albanian residents of Krume showed no qualms about
keeping the refugees.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's difficult, but we feel it's a duty because they are our
brothers,'' said Mane Musa, 36, who runs a vegetable stand at the
Krume central square. She has 20 ethnic Albanian refugees from
Kosovo staying in her three-room house, Musa said.
</P>
<P>
   ``They are not the problem. We never think they are the cause of
the bombing,'' she said.

   SCI-PARKINSONs-FETAL (Undated) _ More than a decade after they
touched off a political fight by using tissue from aborted fetuses
in medical research, scientists from the University of Colorado
announced today that fetal brain cell transplants can improve the
condition of Parkinson's Disease patients younger than 60. The
announcement comes 11 years after President Reagan first banned
taxpayer support for fetal tissue research and six years after
President Clinton lifted that ban. It is a landmark experiment both
because it is the first of its kind paid for by the government, but
also because it is the most rigorous examination to date of the use
of brain cell transplants for Parkinson's Disease, an incurable
condition that slowly strips patients of control over their own
muscles. By Sheryl Gay Stolberg. (1300 words)

 &HT;    A world of flavors waits on kitchen shelf
 &HT;    By Reagan Walker
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ W e've come a long way from the days when a taco kit
was considered the most exotic ``ethnic'' cuisine we could buy at
our local grocery store.
</P>
<P>
   I worked with recipe tester Margaret Ann Surber to comb the
aisles of a few area grocery stores, and we came up with literally
dozens of products to bring some global flavor into the home
kitchen.
</P>
<P>
   And the good news is, all the products are indeed easy to use
and less than $5 a pop _ unlike many found at gourmet markets that
sell for twice that price. Do you love the pad Thai noodles at your
favorite Thai restaurant? Then you can have similar noodles within
minutes at home.
</P>
<P>
   Does Indian curry seem intimidating? There are plenty in jars
and cans to give you a quick fix without all the fuss.
</P>
<P>
   Looking for something different for lunch? Make a chicken salad
with some mango chutney or toss some noodles with peanut sauce.
</P>
<P>
   The next time you hit the soy sauce and salsa aisle, linger
awhile. Read the labels. They often have good recipes and
suggestions for use. Some products require more effort than others.
And some deliver more authentic flavor than others. Read on for our
opinions _ but then get busy with your own taste tests.
</P>
<P>
   the Bombay way
</P>
<P>
   Indian is the latest explosion on the packaged ethnic foods
scene, with a wide array of products available, from curries to
condiments. Much of it has bold, spicy flavors with some heat.
Here's what we tasted:
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Sharwood's Indian puppodums ($3.29 at Kroger): Puppodums are
crackers made of black gram bean flour _ sounds gross, but they are
really crispy and delicious. Usually you have to find these at
Indian markets and fry them up. Sharwood's can be popped in the
microwave _ no mess, no fat. A fine accompaniment for an Indian
meal or a great anytime snack.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Patak's Major Grey mango chutney ($3.89 at Harry's Farmers
Markets): This is the quintessential Indian condiment of pickled
fruit, often spooned on top of curries. This variety is
particularly chunky; but we didn't find a great deal of difference
between brands, so go with what you find. If you don't see it with
other ethnic foods, look for it on the condiment aisle. Great to
mix into cream cheese for a dip.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Patak's dopiaza cooking sauce (mild) ($3.49 at Harry's Farmers
Markets): This is a mild, tomatoey sauce in a jar that's easy to
use. It's a nice introduction to Indian flavors. You simply brown
meat, pour in the sauce and heat. It is a bit thick and tends to
scorch if you don't add water.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Patak's hot chili and cumin sauce ($2.49 at Harry's Farmers
Markets): Much hotter and more intense than the dopiaza; this one
comes in a can. It's more authentic and for the more initiated.
Good for meat or vegetables. A real experience.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Curry King curry sauce ($2.99 at Harry's Farmers Markets):
Strong tomato and cinnamon flavors make this one special; it's
recommended as dip, but you need to heat it to really coax out all
the flavors.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Rajah Kashmiri masala paste ($4.38 at Kroger): Here, the
emphasis is on vinegar and chilis. This paste is hot, hot, hot. You
blend it with yogurt to make a sauce for meat or vegetables. You
may have to experiment to find the best ratio of paste to yogurt
for your hot/spice tolerance.
</P>
<P>
   MAIN DISH SALAD
</P>
<P>
   Chutney Chicken Salad
</P>
<P>
   Makes 4 servings Preparation time: 10-15 minutes
</P>
<P>
   A great way to give an American classic _ chicken salad _ an
exotic twist. The next time you have leftover chicken, give this a
try. It's as simple as opening a jar of chutney. For even more
Indian flavor, add a pinch or two of curry powder.
</P>
<P>
   3tablespoons mayonnaise
</P>
<P>
   3tablespoons sour cream
</P>
<P>
   1/4cup mango chutney, chopped if pieces are very large
</P>
<P>
   4green onions, sliced
</P>
<P>
   2ribs celery, sliced
</P>
<P>
   3or 4 boneless, skinless chicken breasts (about 1 pound), cooked
and diced
</P>
<P>
   4lettuce leaves
</P>
<P>
   1tablespoon almonds, toasted and sliced
</P>
<P>
   1tablespoon coconut, shredded and toasted
</P>
<P>
   In a medium mixing bowl, combine mayonnaise, sour cream,
chutney, green onions and celery. Stir in chicken, mix to coat
well. Serve on lettuce leaves and garnish with almonds and coconut.

</P>
<P>
   Mexican mania
</P>
<P>
   The availabilty of Mexican food items is phenomenal, in part
because of the growing Hispanic population in Atlanta and the
ever-popular appeal of food at your local Tex-Mex joint. I always
keep tortillas and cheese on hand for a quick quesadilla. But there
are many other great products to try. Here's the lowdown on some we
sampled:
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Goya guava jelly ($2.49 at Kroger): This tangy jelly isn't bad
on the morning toast, but I like to combine it with rum and lime
juice and then heat it up for a glaze _ especially good on grilled
pork chops.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Knorr refried beans ($1.29 at Kroger): In all honesty, you're
better off making these from scratch _ a great way to use up
leftover beans. Many canned versions of refried beans aren't black;
so if frijoles negros are your choice, this packet variety will do
for a quick fix.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  La Costena chipotles in adobo sauce ($1.19 at Publix): It's so
easy to add a touch of smoky, peppery flavor to your favorite
enchiladas, burritos, tacos and even rice and beans. Just pop open
a can of these smoked, ripe jalapenos. I like to toss a few on a
flour tortilla with shredded cheese for a quick quesadilla. Great
to mix with sour cream for the side, too. Be forewarned, though:
They're smokin' hot; a little goes a long way.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Goya Mexican-style rice (chicken flavor) ($1.79 at Harry's):
This earns points for being a mix but not tasting like one. Good
chicken flavor, with corn and bell peppers, too.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Dona Maria mole sauce ($2.19 at Kroger): Once you've had an
authentic mole ground in a mortar and pestle, you'll probably find
packaged versions like this terribly inferior. Then again, if you
haven't had that opportunity, you may like this mixture of ground
chiles, sesame seeds, cocoa and other spices. Try adding brown
sugar to offset the slightly bitter taste. Nice with turkey
cutlets.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  World Harbors Guadalupe Mountain Mexican-style fajita sauce
($2.29 at Kroger): Better than a dry, packaged mix. Loaded with
flavor and a must for the spring grilling season. You can stir-fry
with it, too.
</P>
<P>
   MAIN DISH
</P>
<P>
   Chipotle Chicken Enchiladas
</P>
<P>
   Makes 12
</P>
<P>
   Preparation time: 20-25 minutes
</P>
<P>
   Cooking time: 20-25 minutes
</P>
<P>
   With so many prepared items on the market, making enchiladas is
a snap. The tortillas and sauce come ready to use. You can buy
shredded cheese, and if you don't have time to cook the chicken
yourself, pick up some pre-roasted. The chipotles add a whole new
dimension to this favorite dish.
</P>
<P>
   2tablespoons vegetable oil
</P>
<P>
   1small to medium onion, diced
</P>
<P>
   3/4pound boneless cooked chicken, chopped
</P>
<P>
   2(10-ounce) cans mild enchilada sauce, divided (we used Old El
Paso)
</P>
<P>
   3to 4 chipotle peppers in adobo sauce, from a can
</P>
<P>
   1/4cup sour cream
</P>
<P>
   2cups shredded cheddar cheese, divided
</P>
<P>
   1(12-count) package medium flour tortillas
</P>
<P>
   Preheat oven to 375 degrees. Lightly grease a 13-by-9-inch
baking dish and set aside. Place oil in a large skillet over
medium-high heat, add onion and cook, stirring constantly, until
onion is soft, about 5 minutes. Add chicken and cook until heated
through. Stir in 1 can enchilada sauce, chipotle peppers, sour
cream and 1 1/2 cups of the cheese. Combine well and spoon fillings
onto tortillas and roll. Place, seam side down, in prepared baking
dish and pour remaining enchilada sauce over the top. Sprinkle with
remaining cheese and bake 20 to 25 minutes.

</P>
<P>
   peanut sauce passion
</P>
<P>
   My theory is that the proliferation of Thai restaurants in
Atlanta is due to a flavor near and dear to Georgians' hearts _
peanuts. Many of us were introduced to peanut sauce as a condiment
for dipping grilled satay, or small skewers of meat. But then we
found it's good on other things too, like spring rolls and noodles.
I love to splash some in my homemade chili. There are numerous
brands available now. We sampled several and found big differences
in flavor and texture.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Dynasty ($1.69 at Harry's): Very tangy and vinegary, with an
afterburn that comes on strong. The hottest of those we tried.
Thin, less sweet than others, with no additions like coconut milk.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Thai Kitchen ($3.89 at Publix): Coconut is the predominant
flavor, and this one also had the most chunks of peanuts. Very
sweet, perfumey and thick. Good for dipping; dilute for dressing;
too much sugar for grilling.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  House of Tsang ($3.89 at Publix): Our favorite. Smooth _ it
uses peanut butter. Not too hot, not too thin. Has a touch of
sherry. Balanced, good for all purposes. Even worth pouring on a
cracker.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Annie Chun's ($4.59 at Harry's): Thin, with lots of sesame
seeds and _ balsamic vinegar? Seems and tastes a little
incongruous. This was more soy/sesame than peanut and would be best
used as a marinade.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  A Taste of Thai ($2.49 at Kroger): This one comes in a packet,
not a bottle, and frankly, we don't think it's worth the trouble.
Your work is rewarded with weak flavor.

   Peanut Noodle Salad
</P>
<P>
   Makes 4 servings
</P>
<P>
   Preparation time: 20 minutes
</P>
<P>
   Cooking time: 5 minutes/Chilling time: 30 minutes
</P>
<P>
   This is a recipe found on the House of Tsang Bangkok Padang
Peanut Sauce bottle. It's so quick and easy, it's become one of my
favorite lunches. For a heartier version, add some chicken. I've
found the Kame brand Chinese egg noodles near the soy sauce and
stir-fry sauces at Kroger. If you can't find them, angel-hair pasta
will work, too.
</P>
<P>
   8ounces of Chinese egg noodles, or angel-hair pasta, cooked
according to package directions, rinsed and drained
</P>
<P>
   6ounces cooked shredded chicken (optional)
</P>
<P>
   1/2cup shredded carrot (about 1 large)
</P>
<P>
   1cup cucumber, matchstick cut
</P>
<P>
   1cup broccoli florets, blanched
</P>
<P>
   1/2cup peanut sauce
</P>
<P>
   In a large bowl, combine the noodles, chicken if using, carrot,
cucumber, broccoli and peanut sauce. Toss to mix well; serve cold.

<P>
   Thai _ beyond peanut sauce
</P>
<P>
   There is more to Thai food than peanut sauce _ principally,
fantastic curry sauces. There are two main brands available _ Thai
Kitchen and Taste of Thai. A couple of tips: Some of the recipes on
the labels call for fish sauce or ``seasoning'' sauce, also sold in
groceries. In Southeast Asia, it's as important a condiment as soy
sauce is in China and Japan. Don't be put off _ used sparingly, it
adds an appealing dash of salty, anchovylike flavor. Secondly, when
cooking with coconut milk (the unsweetened kind), remove the entire
top of the can to pour in order to get all the thick, creamy stuff.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Thai Kitchen red or green curry simmer sauces ($3.99 at
Publix): It doesn't get any easier than this, and perhaps these
pour-and-heat sauces are the best place to start. The difference in
the color simply has to do with the difference in the chiles.
Typically, the green chile would be a bit hotter, but there wasn't
much difference here. Good for any of your favorite meats,
vegetables and tofu.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Thai Kitchen red or green curry paste ($2.79 at Publix): For a
little more work, you'll get a lot more flavor. These pastes are
power-packed. You combine them with coconut milk so you have
control over the heat and flavor.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  A Taste of Thai red curry base ($2.49 at Kroger): This comes
from a packet and has quite a kick. It's a bit paler than the other
curries, with more perfume and sweetness. You use 1 tablespoon with
a can of coconut.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  A Taste of Thai coconut ginger rice ($2.29 at Harry's): If you
are a fan of packaged rice mixes, you'll love this one. I can eat a
bowl of this as is and be satisfied, but the flavors aren't too
strong to serve as a base for curries, either.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  A Taste of Thai coconut ginger soup mix ($2.69 at Harry's):
Are you picking up on a theme here? Ginger and coconut are popular
flavors _ but I would skip this. It doesn't look like the colorful
soup on the package, and it is considerably blander than that
lovely soup at your favorite Thai restaurant.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Thai Kitchen pad Thai noodles ($2.79 at Publix): This kit
provides the noodles and the sauce _ you add the egg and anything
else, like sprouts or chicken or shrimp. Good for a quick fix, but
the sauce is much sweeter than what most restaurants serve.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  A Taste of Thai sweet green chile sauce ($2.29 at Harry's):
Keep this with your other hot sauces for adding a dash of sweet-hot
spice to almost anything, from greens to stews.
</P>
<P>
   MAIN DISH
</P>
<P>
   Quick Green Curry
</P>
<P>
   Makes 3 servings
</P>
<P>
   Preparation time: 10-15 minutes
</P>
<P>
   Cooking time: 20-25 minutes
</P>
<P>
   I once made a Thai red curry paste by hand. I drove to three
different markets to get all the ingredients, and then it took
eight hours with a partner to cut, grind and make the paste. It was
great, but with that kind of labor, I've only done it once. Enter
prepared curry pastes and sauces. They aren't as fresh and complex,
but they sure do satisfy.
</P>
<P>
   1/2to 1 tablespoon green curry paste
</P>
<P>
   1(14-ounce) can coconut milk (lite or regular)
</P>
<P>
   1/4cup fresh basil leaves
</P>
<P>
   1/4cup canned sliced bamboo shoots
</P>
<P>
   3tablespoons fish sauce
</P>
<P>
   2tablespoons brown sugar
</P>
<P>
   1/3cup chicken stock
</P>
<P>
   1small onion, diced
</P>
<P>
   1/2green bell pepper, cored, seeded and diced
</P>
<P>
   8ounces scallops or peeled and deveined shrimp
</P>
<P>
   Cilantro for garnish, if desired
</P>
<P>
   In a medium saucepan, combine curry paste and coconut milk.
Bring to a simmer over medium heat. Simmer 5 minutes and add basil,
bamboo shoots, fish sauce, brown sugar, chicken stock, onion and
bell pepper. Bring to a boil, reduce heat to simmer, cook for 10
minutes, add scallops or shrimp and cook until just done, 3 or 4
minutes. Garnish with cilantro if desired. Serve over cooked rice.

<P>
   stir-frying a cinch
</P>
<P>
   First, get a couple of bags of the frozen stir-fry vegetables.
Even if you love fresh, you know you don't always feel like going
home and chopping. Just discard the sauce provided _ it's way too
salty. Instead, peruse the bottled stir-fry sauces _ you'll be
amazed by the choices.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Lindy's Kung Pao Szechuan sauce ($3.69 at Harry's): A fairly
generic sauce that's good if you are new to these flavors. Though
often Szechuan means spicy, this sauce isn't. Kids would like it.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  House of Tsang Saigon Sizzle stir-fry sauce ($3.89 at Publix):
This one has a very nice heat that gets hotter when cooked. Similar
to a Szechuan sauce but hotter and more complex than Lindy's.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Annie Chun's hot and spicy shiitake mushroom sauce ($4.59 at
Harry's): This one delivers the earthy flavor you'd expect from a
mushroom sauce. It's slightly bitter, but loses that flavor when
cooked. Has an afterburn.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  House of Tsang Imperial citrus stir-fry sauce ($3.49 at
Harry's): Sweet-and-sour fans, this one is for you. Very unusual
and made with natural ingredients like grape juice and orange
puree. It's sweet, so a little different for stir-fry. It would
also make a nice salad dressing, especially for fruit salads. Kids
would probably eat their veggies with a little of this on top.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Lawry's Stir Fry Seasonings (sesame ginger) ($2.99 at Publix):
This is a good starter sauce, but it has more artificial
ingredients than the others. Pretty basic ingredients like soy and
tomato paste make it rather dull.

</P>
<P>
   Here is but one suggestion for a stir-fry. The fact is you can
substitute your favorite vegetables or your favorite meats. This
goes nicely with white or brown rice and canned pineapple chunks or
mandarin orange slices.
</P>
<P>
   1tablespoon plus 2 teaspoons vegetable oil
</P>
<P>
   1tablespoon minced fresh garlic (about 3 cloves)
</P>
<P>
   1pound medium shrimp, peeled and deveined
</P>
<P>
   1red bell pepper, seeded and cut in 1-inch squares
</P>
<P>
   1bunch fresh broccoli, cut in florets
</P>
<P>
   1/3cup water
</P>
<P>
   1/2cup bottled stir-fry sauce
</P>
<P>
   In a large skillet or wok, heat 1 tablespoon of the oil over
medium-high heat. Add garlic and shrimp. Cook 4 minutes, or until
shrimp turn pink, stirring constantly. Transfer the shrimp to a
plate. In the same skillet, heat remaining 2 teaspoons oil over
medium-high heat.
</P>
<P>
   Add red pepper and cook 2 minutes, stirring constantly. Stir in
broccoli and water. Cover and cook 4 to 5 minutes, or until
broccoli is crisp-tender. Uncover and stir in stir-fry sauce and
the shrimp. Cook until the shrimp are heated through and the sauce
forms a glaze. _ Source: Registered dietitian Michele Peters

 &HT;    American palates expand well beyond meat and
potatoes,supermarkets are sticking up on everithing form curry
paste to chipotles
 &HT;    By Reagan Walker
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ A tall, lanky waitress in a North Carolina diner
walked over to a table to take a drink order, and informed the
customer of the daily special: spaghetti.
</P>
<P>
   The customer ordered sweet tea, but declined on the special. ``I
just don't eat any of those strange things, he told her, turning
his attention back to the tired meat-and-potatoes menu. ``I like to
stick to American foods.''
</P>
<P>
   To which the waitress replied: ``You're right. I don't eat no
foreign food either.''
</P>
<P>
   Richard Pillsbury, a geography professor at Georgia State
University, likes to relate that conversation he overheard a few
years back. Its irony, in fact, prompted him to title his latest
book ``No Foreign Food'' (Westview Press, $19.95.) It traces the
astounding speed with which our culture assimilates new and often
``foreign'' culinary concepts.
</P>
<P>
   A few old-timers may remain suspicious of the spaghetti that was
confined to Italian neighborhoods in the first part of this
century. But for the rest of us, ``Italian'' has been dropped from
the description and it's a mainstay of weeknight family meals and
school fundraising suppers.
</P>
<P>
   And all signs are that we will only continue to stir ethnic
cuisines into our daily eating habits. No place bears witness to
this trend better than the local supermarket.
</P>
<P>
   Where once a small corner of a shelf was devoted to such
``exotic'' items as taco kits and soy sauce, there are now entire
aisles crammed withcans, jars, envelopes and boxes containing
flavors from around the world _ peanut sauces, Chinese egg noodles,
Thai curry pastes, Indian pappadoms.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are seeing intense growth in ethnic foods at the retail
level, specifically convenient items at the corner supermarkets,''
said Brian Sansoni, spokesman for Grocery Manufacturers of America,
which represents major brand name food makers.
</P>
<P>
   In 1992, ethnic foods accounted for $208 million in the food
product market. By 1996, that figure was $272 million and market
analysts estimate ethnic food products may reach $383 million by
2001, Sansoni said.
</P>
<P>
   Pillsbury calls the trend ``an extension of trying to reduce
prep and cooking time to fit into our busy schedules combined with
the restlessness which is characteristic of the upper middle
class.''
</P>
<P>
   The days of having the same menu week after week _ roast chicken
on Monday, fish on Friday _ are gone. ``We are tired of eating the
same old thing,'' said Pillsbury. ``We are always looking for
something new over the horizon.''
</P>
<P>
   That something new is often the dish sampled last week at the
latest ethnic restaurant. Some ambitious cooks go so far as to
scout specialty markets, research cookbooks and enroll in cooking
classes to try to duplicate those tastes from scratch.
</P>
<P>
   But it doesn't take a marketing genius to conclude that more
would just as soon cut to the chase and buy their mole sauce or
curry paste ready-made. There is a reason lots of cooks don't own a
mortar and pestle.
</P>
<P>
   ``They are working and they have families and they just don't
have two hours to prepare a meal anymore,'' said Sansoni. Nor do
they have the time or inclination to clean up, Pillsbury added.
</P>
<P>
   Sansori predicts that in years to come, ethnic food products
will not only be more prevalent, but more cleverly marketed _
making shopping for them easier. ``You'll see stores group
everything needed to make an entire meal together on one aisle,''
he said, even if it means dropping in a small refrigerated case in
the middle of a dry goods aisle. That concept already is in play in
some Atlanta area stores, like Harris Teeter, where you can find
refrigerated pasta sauces next to the dry pasta noodles. The goal,
again, is to save time.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's really amazing how the Atlanta market has changed over
the last decade,'' says Pillsbury. ``It used to be that you could
only find certain products at Harry's or at international markets.
Now, most of that stuff you can find at the larger Kroger and
Publix stores.''
</P>
<P>
   Who knows. Stir-fry night and curry dinners may be the school
fundraisers of the future.
</P>
<P>
   In 20-minutes you can have an Asian-inspired noodle salad using
bottled peanut sauce and quick-cook Chinese egg noodles _ items now
found at your local grocery store.
</P>
<P>
   We toured the aisles of a few local and national chain grocery
stores to see what other convenient ethnic items we could find for
a well-stocked global pantry. Here are our favorites:
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Anything from The House of Tsang line of products, beginning
with the Bangkok Padang Peanut Sauce and including any of their
innovative stir-fry sauces.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Thai Kitchen curry paste (red or green) and a can of coconut
milk. To make a paste by hands takes hours. In minutes, you can
have exciting Thai flavors with your favorite meats or veggies.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Sharwood's Indian Puppodums _ crispy crackers spiked with
whole spices like black pepper. Better than potato chips.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Patak's Hot Chili and Cumin Sauce. Just pour a can of this
thin, spicy sauce over your favorite meats and veggies and heat for
an intense, authentic-tasting Indian experience.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  La Costena chipotles in adobo sauce. Pop the can open, chop
and toss some smoky flavor into your favorite enchiladas,
quesadillas, burritos and tacos.
</P>
<P>
   We found literally dozens of cans, jars and envelopes of quick
ethnic fare in local groceries.

AN INITIALLY UNWILLING ROLE MODEL
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By BILL THOMPSON 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Julie Krone never asked to be a role model for little girls. She
never volunteered to be a pioneer for women's equality in the world
of sports _ or anywhere else, for that matter.
</P>
<P>
   When others set out to impose such burdens on her, in fact, she
resisted.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the beginning, I didn't want to participate in that,''
Krone said the other day.
</P>
<P>
   And who could have blamed her? In the early years of her career
as a jockey in the sport of thoroughbred horse racing, she was
plenty busy just trying to get established. Just trying to make a
living.
</P>
<P>
   Who had time to lead a crusade against sexism?
</P>
<P>
   That was then. This is now.
</P>
<P>
   Over the years, Krone began to notice that women in and out of
sports saw her as an icon in the battle for equality. She began to
notice that young girls looked to her for inspiration.
</P>
<P>
   ``As I got older, I realized there was a contribution to make,
being a female in a sport that was mostly in the past dominated by
males.''
</P>
<P>
   Krone decided to accept the ``gender emphasis'' that she
initially rejected even as she went about the business of
diminishing gender emphasis in her chosen field of endeavor.
</P>
<P>
   Primarily because of Julie Krone, female jockeys are no longer a
curiosity at thoroughbred race tracks. Many horse trainers who once
wanted nothing to do with female jockeys now hire them to ride the
best horses in the barn.
</P>
<P>
   There is still sexism in horse racing, but thanks to Krone,
there's a lot less of it than there used to be.
</P>
<P>
   So when Krone retired Sunday after winning three races at Lone
Star Park at Grand Prairie, no one was saying that she'd had a
wonderful career ``for a girl.''
</P>
<P>
   No, experts and nonexperts alike praised her as one of the
finest practitioners of one of the most challenging jobs in all of
sport. Gary Stevens, arguably one of the two or three best jockeys
on the planet, also rode some horses in Grand Prairie over the
weekend _ and he left no doubt regarding Krone's standing among her
peers.
</P>
<P>
   ``She's not just a great woman jockey,'' Stevens said. ``She's a
great jockey, period.''
</P>
<P>
   Her victories in the second, third and fifth races on Sunday's
Lone Star card gave Krone a total of 3,546 first-place finishes in
her 18-year career. Her mounts won more than $81 million in purse
money; as of Sunday, only 15 jockeys had racked up higher lifetime
earnings.
</P>
<P>
   I first saw Krone ride in 1985, at Monmouth Park in New Jersey.
I worked at a newspaper just a few minutes away from Monmouth, and
I would occasionally go to the track at lunchtime to have a hot dog
and watch _ OK, bet _ the Daily Double.
</P>
<P>
   One day, Julie came storming down the stretch aboard some
forgettable nag that most bettors had overlooked, lighting up the
tote board with a juicy payoff and lighting up the faces of what
was by that time a growing coterie of Krone fans. As Krone posed
for pictures in the winner's circle, a grinning railbird smugly
waved his winning ticket.
</P>
<P>
   ``Best horse, best jockey,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The horse wasn't the best, wasn't even close to the best. But
the jockey was the best _ in that race and in thousands of races to
come.
</P>
<P>
   I've followed Krone's career ever since, cheering her through
countless triumphs on the racetrack, laughing with her through her
appearances on David Letterman's TV show, commiserating with her
through the excruciating injuries that finally persuaded her to
give up riding at the age of 35.
</P>
<P>
   She reminisced about the good times and the bad during a news
conference after her final ride _ a second-place finish in the Lone
Star Derby _ and she talked about the ``gender emphasis'' that she
used to avoid.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'd like to think that all the years I ignored it and maybe
purposely pushed it aside, that maybe I've made up for it and
contributed enough to make a substantial difference in a lot of
little girls' lives.
</P>
<P>
   ``I take that role very seriously,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   It's an important role. But she's not just a great role model
for girls.
</P>
<P>
   She's a great role model, period.

SAMPLE THE BEST AND THE `WURST' FROM MUENSTER
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By ART CHAPMAN 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Muenster is one of those great Texas communities that have
developed their own personalities over the years. It is not a
``boutique'' town that grew overnight for the sake of tourists and
antique dealers.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, the farmers who tow their livestock to market daily
would laugh at the notion.
</P>
<P>
   Muenster likes tourists OK, even summons them each spring with
an annual Germanfest. This year's event begins Friday and runs
through Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   But when the festival closes, there will still be some of the
best German sausage available at Fischer's Meat Market. When all
the tourists are gone, you can still go down to Bayer's
Kolonialwaren and Backerei where Cherilyn Pollard will serve an
apple strudel.
</P>
<P>
   At the Center Restaurant &AMP; Tavern, you can get the Altenmuenster
sausage plate, and several places in town serve really good
schnitzel.
</P>
<P>
   There is nothing phony or temporary about Muenster, or
Germanfest for that matter. An appreciation of German food and fun
is a constant thread running through the community's life.
</P>
<P>
   Muenster, on U.S. 82 about 14 miles west of Gainesville, was
established in 1889. Three brothers from Westphalia, than a
province of Prussia, surveyed the area as a possible site for a
German Catholic settlement. Within months of their first visit, a
train stopped on the North Texas prairie and discharged a small
group of settlers.
</P>
<P>
   All they found was a piece of paper with the name ``Muenster''
written on it. It was tacked to a nearby telegraph pole.
</P>
<P>
   The tiny group considered Dec. 8 the birthday of the town,
although they arrived a month earlier. It was on Dec. 8 that the
first Mass was celebrated on a makeshift altar constructed in the
land office. Town records indicate that 25 men, seven women and six
children were present at the Mass.
</P>
<P>
   Agriculture remains the life's blood in Muenster, now a town of
1,500, but Germanfest does give that life a little extra punch.
</P>
<P>
   Where else can you go to a cook-off that features ``schweine
rippen, gerauchertes fleisch,'' and ``wurst?'' For those of us who
can't tell the front from the back on our lederhosen, that means
pork ribs, barbecue brisket and sausage.
</P>
<P>
   Muenster is in Texas _ even though it is dangerously close to
the Oklahoma line _ therefore it must have a chili contest, and it
does.
</P>
<P>
   All those foods are available during Germanfest, as well as
assorted homemade cheeses, breads, pies and cakes.
</P>
<P>
   One of the prize food items that can be purchased at Germanfest
is strudel. There is no strudel contest because strudel is very
hard to make, and no one wants other folks looking over their
shoulder while guarded family recipes are applied.
</P>
<P>
   And, there is always that chance that someone might sneak in
with a strudel that's made from phyllo dough. That, by the way, is
nearly a hanging offense.
</P>
<P>
   If you want to make strudel, make it the right way. Make it the
way Elizabeth Knabe made it. Knabe was one of the six children
present at the first Mass in 1889. Her recipe has been passed down
through the family and is now in the keeping of her granddaughter,
Margie Starke.
</P>
<P>
   Starke warns that it is time-consuming, but worth the effort.
</P>
<P>
   APFELSTRUDEL (Apple Strudel)

cinnamon, flour. Set aside.
</P>
<P>
   Glaze: Beat egg yolk, and add sour cream and sugar.
</P>
<P>
   Place a large clean cloth over a large table; sprinkle with
additional flour and place dough in center. Roll dough; lift, pull
and stretch carefully until dough is as thin as paper. Trim edges.
Brush with butter, and sprinkle and spread apple filling over
surface to within 1 1/2 inches of the ends. Roll up into a long
thin roll. Place carefully on a well-greased baking sheet. Brush
with glaze.
</P>

CAT'S MEEEEWW! OR, BARNABY BITES BACK 
</HEADLINE>

   PHOENIX - Something smelled.
</P>
<P>
   Something smelled bad.
</P>
<P>
   It was there as I was watching TV, when I was working, when I
was cooking and when I woke up.
</P>
<P>
   It seemed to be its own living organism; it came and went at
will, becoming overpowering at one moment and, a second later, just
disappearing. After watching an episode of ``Sightings,'' I became
terrified that Satan had unleashed a demon in our house, just like
the ``Amityville Horror,'' and I was constantly on the lookout for
red eyes peering in my windows at night.
</P>
<P>
   I was showing my husband where I had found demonic proof _ a
cold spot in the living room _ when he looked at me with wide eyes.
</P>
<P>
   ``YES! With my psychic antennae, I'm sensing that you're
dangerously close to the gates of Hell!'' my husband said, and then
suddenly gasped and pointed to the ceiling.
</P>
<P>
   ``Oh. Sorry, it's just a vent!''
</P>
<P>
   ``How was I supposed to know that you turned the cooler on!'' I
protested as I pushed away our cat, Barnaby, who had mistaken my
leg for the arm of the couch and tried to claw the meat from my
bones.
</P>
<P>
   The cat, none too pleased with the apparent rejection,
retaliated in a scratchy and full-mouthed ``Meow.''
</P>
<P>
   It took approximately two seconds for my husband and me to be
hit by the wave of smelly horror that feasted upon our unprepared
and naked nostrils, festering in our lungs with the pain of a
thousand bee stings.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's Barnaby!'' we both gasped as we looked at the cat, who
had stink lines and waves of stench emanating from his smelly kitty
mouth.
</P>
<P>
   I had tried to brush his teeth years ago, an event that didn't
go very well and subsequently caused one of my ex-boyfriends to
comment while holding my hand, ``I can tell you've seen some hard
times, sister, but it's really sexy that you found the will to stay
alive. Did you use a piece of glass? Because those scars are
totally awesome.''
</P>
<P>
   In the course of his life, a very long and tumultuous 12 years,
Barnaby has managed to destroy every new piece of furniture I've
ever purchased by either urinating over it or slicing it open like
a cadaver with his devil claws.
</P>
<P>
   As we all know, cat pee is the most dangerous liquid substance
on Earth. If they had sprayed cat pee in Vietnam instead of napalm
or Agent Orange, that war would have been over in 15 minutes flat.
</P>
<P>
   Once, in a curious moment, I totaled the damage at nearly five
thousand dollars in assorted decimated love seats, chairs, couches,
pillows and, naturally, my clothes. As a result, I've had to resort
to the old Notaro family tradition of covering nearly every stick
of furniture with plastic in the form of tarps, old shower curtains
and Hefty garbage bags. If I could find a Glade air freshener in
the scent of ``Meatball,'' it would be just like walking into
Grandma Notaro's house.
</P>
<P>
   Barnaby, however, has a great life, and I know he's very happy.
He is currently dating my husband's shoe, a Birkenstock named
``Left One,'' and we often catch him during conjugal visits with
her. He's never gone hungry, has toys to play with, and, as the
Great Fearless Hunter, has the death of nearly a dozen paper towels
and one cricket attributed to his name.
</P>
<P>
   I was sure that because of Barnaby's advanced age, our
friendship would be quickly coming to a close, so imagine my shock
when a friend informed me that her cat had just turned 20. Eight
more years of bearing pee and bloodshed was more than I could
stand, but I was powerless.
</P>
<P>
   That is, until the stench of Barnaby's jowls polluted the air
space around me, and I suddenly had a thought.
</P>
<P>
   When I was in high school, my friend Doug took his cat named
Fluffy to the vet to get her teeth cleaned. Fluffy, as it happened,
simply never came back.
</P>
<P>
   ``We should get Barnaby's teeth cleaned,'' I suddenly said
through my pinched nose and covered mouth to my husband, who nodded
in agreement.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sometimes,'' I added in a loud whisper, ``when they're under
anesthesia, they just . . . slip away.''
</P>
<P>
   Now, for all of you who are getting ready to write me a hate
letter on Hello Kitty stationery about how mean I am and that you
really hope that God strikes me barren so I cannot bear children,
let's imagine this: You show me your favorite piece of furniture,
and we'll have Barnaby pee on it, repeatedly. Then we'll let you
play with Barnaby, and I'll even give you a lift to the emergency
room to get your skin graft.
</P>
<P>
   As I got Barnaby ready for his vet appointment several days
later, I lowered him into his carry-all, patted his head and smiled
sweetly.
</P>
<P>
   ``Be a good boy,'' I reminded him as he tried to slash the flesh
on my hand into skin ribbons. ``Now don't bite anyone, because I
don't have insurance to cover that. Don't pee, and if you see a
bright, white light, run toward it. There's Whiskas and Pounce in
the light, Barnaby! Run into the light as fast as you can!''
</P>
<P>
   In one last giant effort before my husband placed the carry-all
in the car, Barnaby curled back his lips and hissed at me, shooting
hot air from the sewer that was his mouth.
</P>
<P>
   When I went to pick him up at the end of the day, I was ready to
hear the tragic news. I had practiced looking up at the sky as I
thought of something really sad, like if Chocolate Twizzlers were
suddenly outlawed, so my eyes would get watery. I practiced quickly
covering my mouth and saying, ``Oh my God! Not Barnaby! Why, Lord,
why?!!!!!''
</P>
<P>
   The receptionist greeted me kindly, and took a deep breath.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was more complicated than we thought,'' she started. ``He
really didn't like us, and it was very difficult to administer the
anesthesia.''
</P>
<P>
   That was my cue. I looked up at the ceiling, thought of a world
without the chewy satisfaction of a Chocolate Twizzler, and felt my
tear ducts begin to well.
</P>
<P>
   ``It didn't go exactly as planned,'' she continued. ``And the
doctor tried very, very hard to save his . . . ''
</P>
<P>
   My hand flew to my mouth.
</P>
<P>
   ``Oh my God!'' I squeaked. ``Not Barnaby! Why, Lord, why?!!!''
</P>
<P>
   The receptionist gave me a puzzled look.
</P>
<P>
   `` . . . tried very, very hard to save his TEETH,'' she
interrupted, ``but he had to pull a bunch of them. That will be
$287.50, please, cash, check or credit card.''
</P>
<P>
   I just stared at her as a tear quickly slid down my cheek. &QL;

HAND-ME-DOWNS HOLD MEMORIES

 (For release Thursday, April 29)

<P>
   I sit on the carpet surrounded by piles of my children's
outgrown clothes.
</P>
<P>
   My task this lazy afternoon is to sort and pack and ship. Out
with the old, make closet space for the new.
</P>
<P>
   The pink toddler sundresses and purple leggings with pink hearts
are all in one stack. My daughter's hand-me-down chain is simple. I
have just one close friend who has a daughter younger than Sarah,
and she lives a few streets away.
</P>
<P>
   I lug a paper bag over when it gets full, and Amy and I share a
pot of tea and watch the girls play in her den. What 1 1/2-year-old
Sally Ann doesn't need, Amy passes on to relatives or church thrift
sales.
</P>
<P>
   Sometimes, I'll see Sally Ann at day care in one of Sarah's
little neon-striped sunsuits or Dalmatian puppy pullover, and I'll
get a time-warp jolt. It's amazing how your children's old clothing
can trigger flashbulb memories, as if past experiences had been
woven into the worn threads.
</P>
<P>
   The disbursement of my son's clothes is a bit more complicated.
</P>
<P>
   I have three close friends with young sons: Tammy, in West
Virginia, with 5-year-old Zachary and 3-year-old Jake; Kristin, in
California, with 4-year-old Max and 2-year-old Cole; and Terri, in
central Florida, with 4-year-old Zachary and 3-year-old Kelley.
</P>
<P>
   And so, every six months or so, I make three piles.
</P>
<P>
   These aren't random stacks by any means. No, they are carefully
selected with the recipients, and their moms, in mind.
</P>
<P>
   The tie-dyed shorts and Greenpeace/endangered wildlife T-shirts
go to Kristin, who once traveled across the country with her
husband and dog in their VW van. I send her the light blue sweater,
too, to match Max and Cole's eyes, and the tan corduroy pants for
cool evenings on the Monterey pier.
</P>
<P>
   Terri gets the Power Ranger pajamas, the Batman T's, and the
preppy blue and green sweater with a collegiate crest. Her son, who
is going to a private Catholic preschool next year, is as enamored
of superheroes as Adam once was. She also gets the swimming trunks,
since the wading pool is filled practically year-round in Orlando.
</P>
<P>
   Tammy, who lives with her family in my grandmother's two-story
farmhouse in West Virginia, gets all the play clothes, since her
boys still spend much of their days climbing apple trees, sliding
across the wet pasture on their knees and making mud pies in the
gravel drive. She also gets the heavier coats and sweaters, since
she's the farthest north and gets the most snowfall.
</P>
<P>
   I try to stick a few discarded toys and books in each box, so
the kids won't think I'm that boring mommy who just sends boxes of
clothes all the time. These treats have become so popular with Max
that he calls Adam, whom he has met only once in real life,
``Adam-from-the-box.''
</P>
<P>
   Kristin sends pictures of the boys in Adam's clothes, which he's
happy to see are enjoying a fresh lease on life while
snow-sledding, seal-watching and trail-hiking.
</P>
<P>
   And so, as my babies sprout up and out, I pause in midstream to
send my friends these secret messages.
</P>
<P>
   Because, of course, that is what the clothing boxes really are.
They say: Watch out. Pay close attention. See how fast they grow?

<TEXT>
<P>
   Building a staircase is a job for a master carpenter, but an
experienced do-it-yourselfer can usually construct a simple set of
stairs for a backyard deck. Cutting the pieces and assembling them
are relatively simple. The hard part is measuring the rise,
calculating the number of steps needed and marking the layout on
the boards. This part may take some trial and error, in adjusting
the dimensions of the steps, to get the number of steps to come out
even.
</P>
<P>
   The main components of stairs are the tread, riser and
carriages. The tread is the flat horizontal board that you step on
as you walk up or down the stairs. The riser is the vertical board
that extends up from the back of one tread to the nose of the one
above. Together the tread and riser join to make a step.
</P>
<P>
   Carriage boards, or stringers, are the long slanting boards that
rise from the ground to the top of the deck. The steps are mounted
in a series of notches, resembling a sawtooth pattern, that must be
cut into the carriage boards. Stairs with steps less than 32 inches
wide (from side to side) need only two carriage boards, provided
the tread is at least 1 1/2-inches thick. Thinner treads, made of
3/4-inch stock, need a carriage centered between the others if they
span more than 24 inches.
</P>
<P>
   An ideal riser height is 7 or 8 inches. The optimal tread width
(from front to back) is 10 inches. Treads should never be less than
9 inches, nor more than 11 inches.
</P>
<P>
   Begin by measuring the total rise of the stairs, that is the
distance from the ground to the top of the deck. It is easy to take
this measurement at the foot of the deck, but this may not be good
idea if the ground around the deck is uneven. The steps will meet
the ground a few feet from the deck. If this area is significantly
higher or lower than the ground around the deck base, it could
affect the pitch of the steps, so it's a good idea to take a second
measurement away from the deck, approximately four feet for stairs
with only four or five steps, and compare the two figures.
</P>
<P>
   Divide the total rise by seven (the ideal riser height in
inches) to get the number of risers. A whole number indicates that
each riser will be exactly seven inches high. If the number has a
remainder, ignore the remainder and divide the whole number into
the total rise to determine the dimensions of the risers. For
example, suppose the total rise is 45 inches. Dividing 7 into 45
inches yields 6.43. This means that there will be 6 risers in this
pattern. Dividing 6 into 45 inches yields 7.5 inches, the height
for each riser.
</P>
<P>
   Next, calculate the total run, the length of the stairs from the
first step to the deck. Select a tread width -- it's best to start
with 10 inches so you can add or subtract an inch if necessary --
and multiply by the number of treads to find the total run.
Remember that there is always one less tread than riser.
</P>
<P>
   Using the previous example, there are 6 risers, but there will
only be 5 treads, because the top riser will mate with the deck
surface. Multiplying 5 by 10 inches yields a total of 50 inches,
the total run of the stairs. You can modify this distance somewhat
by adding or subtracting one inch from the tread width.
</P>
<P>
   When you know the number of risers and treads, you can calculate
the amount of lumber needed. Multiply the number of treads and
risers by their width (side to side) in inches. Calculating the
length of the carriages requires a bit more thinking. Since the
carriage forms the hypotenuse in a right triangle, you can use the
Pythagorean Theorem to find its length. Square the measurement of
the total rise and add it to the squared figure of the total run.
The square root of the sum is the length of the carriage. Using the
previous example: 45 inches squared plus 50 inches squared is 4,525
inches. The square root of 4,525 is 67 inches.
</P>
<P>
   If this sounds too complicated, you can simply run a tape
measure from the floor of the deck to the point where the stairs
will start. Double this figure because there are two carriages,
then add about 24 inches. The extra length will allow some leeway
in case you have adjust the layout around any defects in the
boards.
</P>
<P>
   At this point you have determined the dimensions of the stairs
and you have obtained the lumber for the project. You are now ready
to lay out the steps, cut the pieces and assemble them together.
This will be covered next week. &QL;

SEARCH, RECORD, REPLAY

   (Circuits)  
(jt) 
 By PETER H. LEWIS   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Thursday marks the beginning of National TV-Turnoff Week, an
annual event in which several million people vow to leave their
television sets dark for seven days no matter how many tantrums
their children throw.
</P>
<P>
   TV-Free America (www.tvfa.org), the group that sponsors
TV-Turnoff Week, wants people to spend the time they would usually
spend watching TV _ an average of 3 hours 46 minutes per day per
person, according to the A.C. Nielsen Company, a market research
firm _ in pursuit of more creative pastimes, including ``healthy
physical activity, civic engagement, reading, thinking and doing.''
</P>
<P>
   Those are laudable goals, of course. To prepare for this week, I
got some healthy exercise installing an intriguing new device
called ReplayTV (www.replaytv.com), which some day _ not any time
soon, but some day is destined to be the successor to the
not-so-trusty video cassette recorder.
</P>
<P>
   As for reading, I spent about an hour studying the ReplayTV
manual, learning about its many features. And as for thinking, here
it is: Because the ReplayTV video recorder is so smart, so much
easier to use and so much more talented than my old-fashioned VCR,
it will very likely change the way I watch television. I'll
probably end up watching more TV than before.
</P>
<P>
   Sorry, TV-Free America.
</P>
<P>
   ReplayTV is the first of several new tapeless VCR devices to
arrive this year, not as replacements for the VCR _ at least not
immediately _ but rather as smart companions. Unlike a VCR,
ReplayTV lets you watch a ``real-time recording'' of a live
program, put it on pause, then return to pick up your viewing where
you left, even as the recording continues. It also makes recording
programs easier. (ReplayTV's main rival, Tivo Inc., whose Personal
Television Service is made by Philips Electronics, declined to make
a review unit available for a comparative review. More information
is at the www.tivo.com site.)
</P>
<P>
   Unlike the VCR, which records programs on inexpensive magnetic
tape and plays back prerecorded tapes, ReplayTV records video
programs on a hard disk drive like the one in a personal computer.
It does so by compressing and decompressing the video and audio
signals almost instantaneously, and as a result it appears that
what is running is live TV, when what the viewer is actually
monitoring is a real-time recording _ the recording is being made
as the show is being broadcast or sent over cable.
</P>
<P>
   Because it is a real-time recording, the ReplayTV device has
capabilities that go far beyond a VCR. One can sit down to watch a
program, then pause it for a few minutes to answer a phone call or
to nuke some popcorn in the microwave. When you return, you resume
watching the show without missing anything. The show is still being
recorded, but you are watching it now with a time delay, in other
words, your are actually watching something that was recorded a few
minutes earlier.
</P>
<P>
   You can continue to watch a few minutes behind for the rest of
the evening, or you can catch up during commercials by using the
quick-skip button on ReplayTV's remote control, a button that
advances the show precisely 30 seconds, which just happens to be
the length of the average television commercial.
</P>
<P>
   The hard drive allows a quick reverse, too, unlike tape, which
has to be rewound. Viewers can hit an instant-replay button for any
scene, whether a close play at the plate or a line of dialogue lost
when the kids were fighting over who could use the ReplayTV system
next. There are also VCR-like controls for fast forward and
reverse.
</P>
<P>
   Recording a single program or movie is easier than it is on a
standard VCR, once the user goes through an inescapable hour to set
up the system and read the manual. Part of the set-up entails
connecting the ReplayTV's built-in modem to a standard phone line.
The box then calls _ toll free _ a database each night in the wee
hours to update the latest program schedules for any television
services the user has, including broadcast, cable and satellite.
</P>
<P>
   Using the remote control wand that comes with the system, the
user then calls up the on-screen TV listings guide, highlights the
program to be recorded, and pokes the record button on a remote
control. There is no need to enter channels or start and stop
times, as ReplayTV keeps track of all that. Pressing the button
twice instructs ReplayTV to record not just this one episode, but
all future shows in the series, as long as there is room on the
drive.
</P>
<P>
   This idea of persistent, intelligent recording is the most
intriguing feature of ReplayTV. It enables couch potatoes to create
their own television channels based on favorite themes _ not just
series names like ``Star Trek'' or ``ER,'' but also ``Yankees'' or
``fishing'' or ``Michelle Pfeiffer.'' It can track actors,
directors, hobbies, obsessions and key words.
</P>
<P>
   Typing in the themes using ReplayTV's clunky virtual keyboard is
a temporary annoyance but a long-term benefit. (Searching the
program guide on screen is also slow and clunky.) Once programmed,
the ReplayTV system will automatically search through each week's
available program listings to find anything that matches those key
words. The system works even if the show changes times from week to
week.
</P>
<P>
   If the theme is Michelle Pfeiffer, for example, ReplayTV can
find her in a movie on one channel, on a talk show the next week on
another channel and so on. ReplayTV will seek out and record any
program where her name appears in the program listing, as long as
there is space on the hard drive. The viewer can watch the shows at
a convenient time, and then either erase them or transfer them
through a VCR to videotape for archiving or portability, for
example.
</P>
<P>
   Despite its cleverness, ReplayTV is not going to send the VCR to
the junk pile any time soon. A decent VCR can be had for less than
$200, and six hours of programs can be recorded on a tape that
costs $2. An entire season's worth of ``Ally McBeal'' can be stored
on $10 worth of videocassettes and treasured for years.
</P>
<P>
   In contrast, ReplayTV has limited recording space. The ReplayTV
model 2001 ($699) can record a maximum of about 10 hours of
programming at the lowest of three levels of recording quality, and
after that the machine will start recording over previously
recorded shows, unless the shows are protected. The Model 2003 has
a maximum capacity of 14 hours and costs $899. The Model 2004 has
up to 28 hours of storage and costs $1,499.
</P>
<P>
   Compared with videotapes, hard drive recording space is
expensive. The ReplayTV system uses one gigabyte of hard drive
space to record one hour of video using its standard
(lowest-quality) MPEG-2 compression ratio. The image is slightly
inferior to that on a VHS tape, especially for sports or action
movies, because of weaknesses of the MPEG-2 system. To get better
picture quality, the user must choose medium compression, which
cuts the recording capacity in half. To get an image equal to that
of the original signal, including cable and satellite signals, the
ReplayTV recording should be set on high, which reduces the
available recording time even further.
</P>
<P>
   ReplayTV will become more attractive when hard drives become
cheaper or when improved mathematical formulas for compression
increase recording capacities by squeezing more data onto the
drive. ReplayTV comes with an IEEE-1394 (Firewire) data port, which
means that ReplayTV is planning to support future Firewire-based
storage attachments that could record onto, or play back from, some
type of removable medium like a recordable DVD disk.
</P>
<P>
   My wife discovered, much to her annoyance, that the ReplayTV box
made noise all night long, even when it was not recording, because
the hard disk is always spinning, so the device was banished from
the bedroom TV to my office TV.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike the Tivo system, which relays a ``personal profile'' of
the owner's viewing habits back to Tivo and then to advertisers,
the ReplayTV phone call each night gathers program listing
information but does not report on what the owner has been
watching. For privacy reasons alone, I would choose it over the
Tivo.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, I have some sympathy for the TV-Free America folks.
They note that some six million videocassette movies are rented
each day, compared with three million items checked out of public
libraries, and that the average American youth watches 1,500 hours
of television a year, compared with 900 hours spent in school.
</P>
<P>
   If ReplayTV makes it easier to track down quality programming in
the vast wasteland of television, that is really doing something.

A HERO WHO, ODDLY, DOESN'T LOOK THE PART 
</HEADLINE>
   (af)  
 By J.C. HERZ   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The eponymous hero of Abe's Exoddus doesn't fit the description
of a video game superman. He's not a lantern-jawed commando armed
with assault weapons, inexhaustible ammunition and a rippling
physique.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's a schlub,'' said Lorne Lanning, who directed Abe's
Exoddus, the second title in the Oddworld quintology that began
with Abe's Oddysee. In the first title, Abe frees his fellow
Mudokons from Rupture Farms, a meat-packing plant whose ruthless
corporate overseers, the Glukkons, were butchering its workers to
increase short-term profits. Once an ignorant, happy floor waxer,
Abe becomes a hero to his people.
</P>
<P>
   In the middle of his hero's reception, however, a clumsy fall
knocks him unconscious, and a vision reveals his next destination:
Soul Storm Brewery, where the Glukkons grind Mudokon bones into a
tasty narcotic beverage. Soul Storm Brew is highly profitable (and
it keeps the workers in line), but the bone shortage created by the
shutdown of Rupture Farms has put a damper on earnings.
</P>
<P>
   Being very practical and profit-minded, the Glukkons have found
another source of raw materials _ the ancient Mudokon burial
grounds _ commenced mining and accelerated factory production to
meet quarterly earnings estimates.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were inspired by the corporate raiders of the world,''
Lanning said. ``The guys that find profit in destruction. They have
a very practical, legal way that they can make a good next quarter.
And their market will support that, and everyone's all hunky-dory,
except the guys that work there.''
</P>
<P>
   So Abe rounds up five friends and sets out across the desert to
shut down Soul Storm Brewery. Thus begins Abe's Exoddus, another
hero's ordeal for our scrawny-shouldered floor-waxer-cum-messiah.
What follows is in some ways a typical action-adventure game filled
with platforms, trap doors, armed assailants and dangerous
industrial equipment.
</P>
<P>
   But the game is atypical in other ways: Abe doesn't carry a gun.
He has to solve his problems by thinking them out, using his brain,
being clever. And he needs help, which means managing a group of
ragtag Mudokons who are unskilled, miserable, tired and
uncooperative.
</P>
<P>
   But the game is atypical in other ways: Abe doesn't carry a gun.
He has to solve his problems by thinking them out, using his brain,
being clever. And he needs help, which means managing a group of
ragtag Mudokons who are unskilled, miserable, tired and
uncooperative.
</P>
<P>
   It also has suggestive, and disturbing, resonances. A game named
Exoddus with a group of creatures who are slave laborers in a
nightmare factory that grinds them up for profit cannot help but
invite thoughts of the Holocaust and raise questions of taste. But
the designers say there was no intention to tie the game to the
Holocaust.
</P>
<P>
   To be sure, there are other cultural references in the game _
American Indian masks and Australian aboriginal music. And the look
of the game suggests newts in trouble rather than crimes against
humanity.
</P>
<P>
   Lanning said the Exodus reference was Biblical and meant to
suggest the triumph of the downtrodden, any downtrodden. He said
the Mudokons could easily stand in for American Indians or
aboriginal Australians or wage-slaves in Southeast Asia, and that,
above all, they are heroes. ``It's what happens when cultures are
oppressed and individuals rise to the occasion to make change,''
Lanning said.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, it's a game, not a treatise. And one of the
challenges and pleasures is that the Mudokons are not oppressed
humans, they're some kind of really dumb, but cute, green trolls,
which poses problems for Abe.
</P>
<P>
   It's one thing to lead the ``Mission: Impossible'' team. It's
another to undertake a heroic enterprise with a bunch of losers who
need constant supervision. Half of the game controls in Abe's
Exoddus have to do with communication. Some words are simple
commands (``Work,'' ``Wait,'' ``Follow me,'' and ``Stop it.'').
``Hello'' initiates a conversation. ``All ya!'' alerts all the
Mudokons at once.
</P>
<P>
   But part of Abe's vocabulary is gestures, or postures,
indicating feelings like anger and sympathy. And you need this
emotional vocabulary because the Mudokons are a moody lot. If
they're angry, they won't listen to you unless you say you're
sorry. If they get ahold of laughing gas, you have to slap some
sense into them.
</P>
<P>
   Sometimes they get depressed; they're so upset about living in
slavery that they'll scarcely acknowledge Abe. If you yell at them,
they'll commit suicide. If you want to be General Patton, you're in
the wrong game.
</P>
<P>
   For some people, that might be disappointing or frustrating. A
lot of games are sold on the promise of omnipotence. They put you
in a world where you embody strength and aggression and a sort of
cartoon arrogance that is appealing, particularly to adolescent
boys.
</P>
<P>
   On the other hand, it's refreshing to play a video game whose
emotional range extends beyond rage and fear and whose protagonist
is not an amalgamation of Arnold Schwartzenneger, Bruce Willis and
Sylvester Stallone. Abe is more like a combination of Roberto
Benigni, Michael Moore and E.T.
</P>
<P>
   ``We try to design our characters as archetypal forms that
represent certain states of mind,'' Lanning said. ``In Abe's case,
he's certainly not the most intelligent guy in the world, but he
has an intuitive understanding of the difference between right and
wrong. He's not able to intellectualize it. In fact, if he was
arguing with someone halfway intelligent, he'd probably lose the
debate. But still, in his heart, he knows the difference. And so to
us, he embodies a sense of pure conscience undiluted by logic.''
</P>
<P>
   Abe is an archetype, no less than the cowboys and commandos in
Duke Nukem and Quake. But he's a different archetype _ the little
guy _ so he inhabits a different kind of story, which is a story
about losing your innocence and becoming a hero.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's allegorical to the way things work in today's world,''
Lanning said. ``In many ways, it's a story like `The China
Syndrome' or `Silkwood.' Very ordinary people find themselves in
extraordinary circumstances where their own conscience is what's
tearing them apart. They think everything's fine, they witness
something, and it blows apart their whole perception of reality.
</P>
<P>
   So for Abe, he was working in the meat-processing plant. He was
employee of the year. And then he found out the place was not what
it was cracked up to be. The retirement plan was a lie, and he was
going to wind up a Tasty Treat. And it just shattered his whole
perception of reality, and he had to do something. For us, those
are inspiring stories.''

GARDENING QUESTIONS AND ANSWERS 
</HEADLINE>
  (jt) 
 By LESLIE LAND   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Blueberries in Shade
</P>
<P>
   Q. I would like to know if I can plant blueberries in a raised
bed in my garden on Long Island. The spot I have in mind is in the
shade of a mature oak tree, about 12 feet from the trunk.
</P>
<P>
   A. There are three common kinds of blueberry: the ``wild'' ones,
Vaccinium angustifolia, low-growing spreaders that are pretty, but
not suitable for home fruit production; rabbiteye blueberries, V.
ashei, which do best in the South, and highbush blueberries, V.
corymbosum. These last ones would be an excellent choice for a Long
Island garden, particularly one with the acidic soil for which the
area is famous. But it would be best if you could find a brighter
spot for them. Though blueberries are often described as able to
tolerate some shade, there's likely to be more than ``some'' only
12 feet from a mature oak.
</P>
<P>
   Sunshine problems aside, the location you have in mind won't be
ideal unless that raised bed is really king-size. Most of the
reliable, readily available highbush cultivars, including Blueray,
Patriot and Bluecrop, can eventually become shrubs 6 feet tall and
almost as wide, and you'll need at least two of them _ even
varieties advertised as ``self-fertile'' do much better with a
pollinator nearby. While there are some handsome dwarf types that
would fit nicely in a raised bed (Northblue, for instance, is about
two feet tall), they are not what you'd call fruit factories.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, that won't matter if you're growing blueberries as
ornamentals. Their pretty spring flowers and bright yellow, orange
or red autumn foliage are reason enough to grow them even without
fruit _ which is what you will certainly be doing unless you
protect your crop from the birds. It's a good idea to build an
arbor around the bushes when you first plant. This structure will
add visual interest while the shrubs are still small. Then, when
it's time to foil the flying freeloaders, you'll have a ready-made
frame from which to hang the bird-netting.
</P>
<P>
   Catalogs offer a good selection of early, midseason and
late-ripening fruits, so you can have blueberries for almost two
months. You can also end up with bloom times too widespread for
cross-pollination, so if the catalog doesn't say when they flower,
don't forget to ask.
</P>
<P>
   Patriot, Blueray, and V. angustifolium are among the choices
available from Bear Creek Nursery, P.O. Box 411, Northport, Wash.
99157; (509) 732-6219. Patriot, Bluecrop and Northblue are sold by
the Henry Fields Seed and Nursery Company, 415 North Burnett,
Shenandoah, Iowa 51602; (605) 665-9391. Catalogs from both are
free.
</P>
<P>
   Building Up a Bed
</P>
<P>
   Q. I plan to build up a perennial bed with an extra two to three
inches of soil and compost. Now that bulbs are blooming and new
shoots have started to grow, is it necessary to dig up and replant
everything, or will my bulbs and perennials adapt to being buried
deeper?
</P>
<P>
   A. There are a few perennials that are fussy about being buried
no matter what the season. Peonies, for instance, will fail to
bloom if the shoot-forming buds are more than about an inch and a
half underground. And the lumpy rhizomes of bearded iris are prone
to rot if their tops don't get light and air.
</P>
<P>
   Special exceptions like these aside, the rest depend on how much
of your mixture is compost and how much is soil. Compost is organic
matter that's partly decomposed. It's lighter and fluffier than
soil, so usually it doesn't promote rot, and vigorous shoots can
push right through it. Over the course of the season, compost will
break down into the old soil, adding nutrients, improving structure
and encouraging beneficial organisms. Two or three inches of pure
compost won't hurt your plants, but it will disappear _ by fall the
bed won't be any taller than it was before.
</P>
<P>
   Soil is a different story. The different kinds vary greatly, but
all of them are heavier than compost, and because they contain lots
of sand and clay as well as organic matter, they don't keep
breaking down the way compost does. Though a three-inch layer of
soil would permanently raise the height of your beds, if you
applied it now it would be likely to rot any foliage it's pressed
against, and it would damage (or kill) most new shoots if you
heaped it right on them.
</P>
<P>
   So, if by ``build up'' you mean ``improve,'' you can add compost
right now. But if your goal is the altitude provided by a thick
layer of soil, it's better to lift the plants or wait until next
winter. As long as they're still underground, most bulbs won't mind
being buried a bit deeper, and established perennials should have
no trouble pushing new growth up two or three inches farther to
reach the light.
</P>
<P>
   Skunks in the Suburbs
</P>
<P>
   Q. I live in a lovely suburb 15 minutes outside Boston, and we
have a large skunk community. How can I keep them out of my yard?
Is there some kind of plant or shrub or other organic matter they
will avoid? It wouldn't be a problem, except that my dog cannot
stay away from them. Is there a way to get rid of them?
</P>
<P>
   A. Getting rid of them is not to be. Skunks have adapted very
well to the suburbs, where there are lots of good things to eat _
lawn grubs, earthworms, mice and rats _ and plenty of sheltered
places to build dens. When you remove a skunk from such habitat,
all you do is open territory for the next one.
</P>
<P>
   The best way to keep them out of your yard is with a low, tight
wire-mesh fence. Skunks don't do much climbing, so a height of two
feet should be adequate. They do dig, though, so you'll want to
bury the fencing six to eight inches deep. Nothing repels them, but
they are easily attracted, especially by grub-infested lawns and
anything fishy, meaty or sweet. (They love moldy cake and stale
cookies almost as much as raccoons do.)
</P>
<P>
   Some authorities suggest drenching the lawn with pesticides to
get rid of the grubs, but even doing that is unlikely to solve the
skunk problem completely. It's important to keep the garbage
covered, and to be aware that organic fertilizers like blood meal
and bone meal are powerful lures. Keep unused supplies in tightly
lidded containers, and be sure to work the fertilizers well into
the soil as soon as you use them.
</P>
<P>
   Since, as you note, the problem is not so much with the skunks
as with your dog, the easiest solution is probably to control the
pet rather than the polecats.
</P>

SENATE RACE COULD BE BED OF THORNS FOR HILLARY 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (For release Sunday, April 25)   Commentary  
 (For use by New York Times News Service Clients)  
 By ROBERT E. THOMPSON  
 c. 1999 Hearst Newspapers  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ ``I love New York, I always have,'' purred Hillary
Rodham Clinton, delivering what could be the opening line in a
fascinating political drama.
</P>
<P>
   The first lady campaigned last week through the state that next
year will elect a successor to the eminent Sen. Daniel Patrick
Moynihan, a Democrat who is retiring after four terms. Her hope,
presumably, is that she will be that successor.
</P>
<P>
   It is not easy to excite the residents of a state that is
satiated with celebrities from the worlds of sports, theater, high
finance, literature and politics. But Hillary is trying to and
appears to be succeeding, at least with Democrats who want her to
seek Moynihan's seat.
</P>
<P>
   With charm and intelligence, she is paving her own way to a
possible announcement that she will take up residence in New York
and enter the Senate race.
</P>
<P>
   But she is enough of a realist to understand that what could
await her is a bed of thorns rather than a bed of roses.
</P>
<P>
   Having campaigned many times with her husband, she should be
ready for blistering assaults on her character, her credibility,
her role as mother and wife and her part in the many controversial
activities that have gotten her attention.
</P>
<P>
   If she decides to run for the Senate, and if her Republican
opponent is New York Mayor Rudolph Giuliani, Hillary would be
entering the ring against a tough, determined political pugilist
who would not be awed by her status as first lady.
</P>
<P>
   Critics will be scanning a new book, ``The First Partner:
Hillary Rodham Clinton,'' by Joyce Milton and other books for dirt
about the president's wife. Publishers's Weekly describes Milton's
book as ``a revealing and withering portrait.''
</P>
<P>
   In it, Milton probes Hillary's role in questionable political
fund-raising activities as well as her relationship with a
philandering husband who is an adept prevaricator. Milton suggests
a romantic link between Hillary and Vincent W. Foster Jr., her
onetime law partner who became a White House aide and took his own
life. She also claims that Hillary declared the White House
off-limits to Barbra Streisand because the president and the
chanteuse allegedly were involved in a bit of hanky-panky.
</P>
<P>
   Hillary has no role model for this adventure because no previous
first lady has sought public office after her husband's White House
tenure came to an end.
</P>
<P>
   The idol with whose spirit Hillary sometimes communes, Eleanor
Roosevelt, made a career of demolishing barriers erected to control
the activities and ambitions of women. Yet she didn't seek elective
office.
</P>
<P>
   After the death of President Franklin D. Roosevelt in 1945,
there were some suggestions that Mrs. Roosevelt might run for
office in her home state of New York.
</P>
<P>
   But nothing came of the idea. Mrs. Roosevelt did play a
prominent role, however, in Democratic Party activities, starting
in 1940 when she flew to the national convention in Chicago to
quell a rebellion against her husband's selection of liberal
Agriculture Secretary Henry A. Wallace as his third-term running
mate.
</P>
<P>
   In the 1950s, she was a strong supporter of Adlai Stevenson for
president. At the 1960 convention, she again urged Stevenson's
nomination, but the prize went to John F. Kennedy.
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Roosevelt's most enduring commitment, following 12 years in
the White House, was to the United Nations. President Harry Truman
appointed her a delegate to the world organization in 1945 and she
served until 1953. Kennedy reappointed her in 1961, but she died
the following year.
</P>
<P>
   Other former first ladies have been active in their post-White
House years, without venturing into political battle as Hillary may
do.
</P>
<P>
   After her second husband, Aristotle Onassis, died, Jacqueline
Kennedy Onassis became a highly-regarded book editor at Doubleday.
Lady Bird Johnson, who made beautification of America a major theme
of her activities as first lady, established, in her post-White
House years, the National Wildlife Research Center in Austin,
Texas.
</P>
<P>
   Betty Ford, who struggled with alcoholism and drug abuse,
established the Betty Ford Clinic to help others overcome their
chemical dependency. Rosalynn Carter has continued since the end of
her husband's presidency to support efforts to help the mentally
ill.
</P>
<P>
   Nancy Reagan and Barbara Bush have made a few public
appearances, but have not taken on major projects.
</P>
<P>
   If Hillary Rodham Clinton accepts the challenge to run for
office in New York, she will be a trailblazer, a pioneer slashing
her way through the Empire State's tangled political thicket.
</P>
<P>
   She told reporters in New York last week that ``right now I am
very focused on the situation in Kosovo.'' She is ready to visit
the area at the invitation of the U.S. Agency for International
Development.
</P>
<P>
   The first lady added: ``I think it is very important for me to
go to Kosovo eventually, but I want to go when my going does not
interfere with the work and in any way displace resources.''
</P>
<P>
   Such a journey could add to her prestige and strengthen her
political credentials. That other female political pathfinder,
Elizabeth Dole, must have seen similar advantage in such a journey
when she visited the Balkans and returned recently to proclaim that
the war must be won.

   SCI-PARKINSONS-FETAL (Undated) _ More than a decade after they
touched off a political fight by using tissue from aborted fetuses
in medical research, scientists from the University of Colorado
announced today that fetal brain cell transplants can improve the
condition of Parkinson's Disease patients younger than 60. The
announcement comes 11 years after President Reagan first banned
taxpayer support for fetal tissue research and six years after
President Clinton lifted that ban. It is a landmark experiment both
because it is the first of its kind paid for by the government, but
also because it is the most rigorous examination to date of the use
of brain cell transplants for Parkinson's Disease, an incurable

<P>
   The office of Children's Television Workshop Online in Manhattan
is a preschooler's decorating dream, with a wall-size blackboard,
armchairs that fairly beg for someone to curl up and tell a story
and a mesmerizing carpet of crayon-bright red, blue and orange that
could have been designed by a Romper Room Martha Stewart. The only
thing missing is ... children.
</P>
<P>
   But maybe not. Most of the staff members who designed and
created the new Web site (www.ctw.org) for the Children's
Television Workshop, the creator of ``Sesame Street,'' look too
young to even have children themselves. But they have valuable
firsthand experience: they are, after all, members of the first
generation of children who grew up with Muppets.
</P>
<P>
   Tina Sharkey, the group's vice president and general manager,
certainly fits that description, and she was described by her
former boss, Candice Carpenter, a founder of the Internet company
iVillage, as ``more like a kid than any other adult I know.'' Ms.
Sharkey, who is 34, said the ``Sesame Street'' show ``invented one
of the most important movements of the 20th century, empowering
families to get involved with their kids' learning.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Sharkey admits that she still watches ``Sesame Street.'' ``I
was on the treadmill one morning last season, watching an episode
about Slimey the Worm, who wanted to go into outer space,'' she
said. ``There was Tony Bennett, standing on a rooftop singing,
`Slimey to the Moon,' and all of a sudden, I started sobbing. It
was amazing.''
</P>
<P>
   The task that faced Ms. Sharkey and her team of 30 producers,
designers and marketers at Children's Television Workshop Online in
1997 was to recreate on the Web the enormously familiar and
comforting blend of education and entertainment that ``Sesame
Street'' pioneered on television nearly three decades earlier. ``We
had to take what we as a company understand about a 6-year-old's
mind-set and then apply it to the Web,'' Ms. Sharkey said.
</P>
<P>
   In some ways, Sesame Street's status as a pop-culture icon, as
the veritable gold standard of children's programming, made the
online team's job more complicated. They had to compete with a
legend. The producers of Sesame Street understood kids and they
understood television. But did they understand the Internet?
</P>
<P>
   In addition, the Web site for the company, which is nonprofit,
had to define itself in relation to such well-entrenched commercial
destinations as Disney Online's www.disney.com and the www.nick.com
site of the Nickelodeon cable network.
</P>
<P>
   In February, Nickelodeon announced its plan to create a free
online service for kids, tentatively named Project Nozzle.
Scheduled to begin on Sept. 1 and backed by on-air promotions from
Nickelodeon worth $100 million, the project is widely viewed as the
network's attempt to ``basically own the children's TV space on
line,'' said Patrick Keane, a senior analyst at Jupiter
Communications, a Web research firm.
</P>
<P>
   When Ms. Sharkey arrived at Children's Television Workshop's
online division in July 1997, the Web site consisted of some
material recycled from a previous online venture and a television
schedule. ``Essentially, when I got there, I found nothing,'' she
said. ``They did a business plan before I got there. There were a
few staffers. That's all.''
</P>
<P>
   The first step was to appeal to the Children's Television
Workshop's core audience: families. One of the insights of the
original designers of ``Sesame Street'' was that children would
watch educational programs more readily if their parents watched,
too, which is one reason the television series has always featured
pop cultural references and celebrities and sophisticated humor.
</P>
<P>
   Web site staff members knew that a receptive family audience was
already on line. A recent study from the Find/SVP and Grunwald
Associates research firms showed that 67 percent of parents who own
computers log on with their children. ``We needed to build on the
idea that we are the only company in the world who has this
rite-of-passage relationship with kids and parents,'' Ms. Sharkey
said. That meant creating a site that encouraged a preschooler to
sit on a parent's lap and engage in collaborative mouse-clicking
adventures _ what the producers began to call ``lapware.''
</P>
<P>
   In designing the site's home page, ``we had to think about the
way kids play, how they like to have everything spread out all
around them and then they want to choose one thing to do,'' said
Paul Marcum, the online group's executive producer. The result was
a menu that is as brightly colored as the office carpet and that
offers users numerous options with names like Sesame Street
Central, Preschool Playground and Activity Time.
</P>
<P>
   Realizing that children like to master tasks, the team designed
interactive games that reward children for right answers. In a
counting game that features the popular Muppet called Grover as a
farmer, children who match numbers hidden in his harvested
vegetables are rewarded with a Tinkerbell-like jingling sound. A
mismatch prompts the computer to emit a noise more reminiscent of a
Bronx cheer.
</P>
<P>
   Another Children's Television Workshop staple has been
storytelling. ``When you're reading a book, the interaction might
consist of turning a page,'' said Karen Kane, the team's director
of programming. ``But we created branching stories on line so
children can control the plot, depending on what they click on.''
</P>
<P>
   For instance, in a story about Telly the Muppet going into outer
space, a child can drag objects into the story to change the
action. Dragging a moon into the story screen sets the scene at
night; if a sun is dragged instead, the story's action occurs
during the day. The activity is especially compelling for small
children, who love repetition, because they can return to the story
to change its plot numerous times.
</P>
<P>
   The redesigned site, called the CTW Family Workshop, went on
line in September 1998, aimed squarely at families with
preschoolers. True to the Sesame Street formula, the site also
offers material for parents, including Internet technical advice
explained in plain English and an easily downloadable program that
lets a user tickle Elmo by clicking on a mouse. The flavor is
unmistakably Sesame Street. And Elmo is adorable.
</P>
<P>
   ``I like the craft activities they have on the site _ I print
them out, and we do them later,'' said Sandy Homan, a mother of two
in Mount Laurel, N.J. Her 6-year-old son, Spencer, is a big fan of
the ``Sesame Street'' television show and visits the Web site every
day. ``I think what he likes about going to the site on line is
that he feels like he's a part of it,'' she added. ``He can
actively do things there, instead of just passively sitting,
watching television.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
nn
</P>
<P>
   The designers have taken pains to make the site distinct from
its commercial counterparts. For instance, the Muppet characters
star in interactive games, but they are not promoted directly as
products, the way commercial sites market their popular characters.
</P>
<P>
   The site has a store created by eToys that sells more than 250
products licensed by Sesame Street, but the merchandise offers are
not as prominent or intrusive as those on commercial sites.
</P>
<P>
   But unlike the television program, the Web site does carry
advertising. There are no advertisements on content aimed directly
at preschoolers, however, and advertisements aimed at older
children are clearly labeled.
</P>
<P>
   Some people concerned with children's media issues say the
limits are not enough. ``I don't think children are a proper target
for commercial speech,'' said Peggy Charren, a visiting scholar at
Harvard University's Graduate School of Education and a leading
lobbyist on such issues. ``Ads tell children they need something
they may not be able to afford when in reality, they probably don't
need it. Children learn best when they feel satisfied with
themselves. And when they want something they can't have, they feel
unsatisfied.''
</P>
<P>
   Gary E. Knell, executive vice president for operations at the
Children's Television Workshop, responded that the Web site
followed the same guidelines the organization had always followed
on not interrupting content aimed at preschoolers with advertising.
``We need something to be self-supporting,'' he said. ``We don't
want the online site to bleed the whole organization into oblivion.
As with every not-for-profit venture, this one has to raise the
money to support its content.''
</P>
<P>
   The Family Workshop site took a bigger risk in January, adding
content aimed at an elementary-school audience, older than the
Sesame Street crowd. The site's new Kid City lets children 6 to 12
years old create their own home pages and collect and trade online
stickers. ``It's original content, based on the idea that we can do
non-Sesame Street content,'' Ms. Sharkey said. ``It's a big step
for us.''
</P>
<P>
   So far, Family Workshop draws considerably fewer visitors than
commercial sites. Certainly, the number of unique visitors to
Disney Online's sites (4.6 million in February) and Nickelodeon
Online's sites (nearly 1.5 million in February) continues to dwarf
the number of visitors to the Children's Television Workshop's
online venture (in February, 300,000), according to Media Metrix, a
company that measures Web traffic.
</P>
<P>
   To broaden its online audience, Children's Television Workshop
has struck a deal that allows it to distribute its content through
the Excite search engine, in its Lifestyle category, and through
Excite's Web Crawler search engine, under its Kids and Family
heading.
</P>
<P>
   Since January, a special version of the Children's Television
Workshop's Family Workshop with exclusive interactive storytelling
content has been available on America Online's proprietary service.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was enormously important to us to get their content, not
only because 53 percent of AOL households have children but because
kids are coming on line at younger and younger ages,'' said Regina
Lewis, an America Online spokeswoman. ``We did a poll of 10,000
parents last month, and 25 percent of them said their kids were
using the computer at age 2. You have to give them quality
programming right from the beginning.''
</P>
<P>
   In the future, the site will probably be gently tweaked, rather
than redesigned, to accommodate what is learned from research about
how families use the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   In a recent research project, Sholly Fisch, the vice president
for program research at Children's Television Workshop and a former
writer for Marvel Comics, went into a handful of homes of computer
users to observe firsthand how families navigate the www.ctw.org
site.
</P>
<P>
   ``I found out it's not a linear experience for them at all, it's
a family thing, with kids getting up from the computer to get
snacks, an older brother coming in in the middle of a session, the
phone ringing,'' Fisch said. ``Now we have to go back and think
about how to use that information to make the site work even
better.''
</P>
<P>
   All the tinkering in the world will probably not vault the site
past larger commercial sites. But there are few sites on the Web
that offer as much of a refuge from commercial pressure as the
Children's Television Workshop site, much as ``Sesame Street'' on
public television has offered a refuge from commercialism. And
that's fine with Ms. Sharkey.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're never going to be as big,'' she said, ``and we're never
going to have the reach or the resources. But you know what? We
have something special.''

certain as to how I should frame out the opening for this doorway.
Can you help?
</P>
<P>
   A: The usual method is to nail a header across the top of the
door opening consisting of doubled 2x4's as shown here. For a
standard 30-inch door the headers should be 35 1/2 inches long. You
first nail the two jack studs (the shorter vertical studs under
each end of the header) to the inner surface of the regular wall
studs on each side of the opening. The jack studs should be 1 3/4
inches longer than the height of the door. The header of doubled
2x4's rests on top of these jack studs. Short lengths of 2x4
(called cripple studs) are then nailed vertically to the inner
surface of the studs above the header on each side.
</P>
<P>
   Q. Some polyurethane varnish was spilled on my kitchen ceramic
tile floor. This dried for several days before I knew about it, so
it was never wiped up. How can I remove this hardened varnish
without damaging the tile?
</P>
<P>
   A: Your best bet would be to use an industrial grade semi-paste
paint and varnish remover. This will soften the varnish enough so
that it can be easily washed away with a detergent or scraped off
with a plastic scraper. Be sure you buy a brand remover that says
on the label that it will work on polyurethane finishes. Then
carefully follow the directions on the can.
</P>
<P>
   Q: The living room floor in our old house seems to be sagging
slightly along one wall. We've been told that this is probably due
to the installation of a large entertainment center and bookcase
that we had built in along that wall, while others say it is due to
warping and settling of the floor beams. What do you think we
should do?
</P>
<P>
   A: It is most likely due to a combination of both _ the extra
weight caused the beams or joists to sag. You should be able to
correct both problems by installing two or more adjustable jack
posts or lolly columns in the basement under that sagging floor.
These posts consist of lengths of heavy steel tubing that telescope
inside each other with an adjustable jack on top. The base of the
post must rest on a concrete footing at least six to 12 inches
thick, which usually means chopping a hole in the basement floor.
This is a job that may require the services of a professional _
unless you are quite handy and familiar with concrete work. Also,
remember that the jack must be raised VERY slowly (no more than
about half a turn every three or four days). Otherwise you can do
severe damage to the house if you're not careful.
</P>
<P>
   Q. We had new storm windows installed on our 32-year-old house a
couple of years ago, but we still have some problems with
condensation on these windows during very cold weather. What can we
do to eliminate this problem?
</P>
<P>
   A. Make certain the storm windows fit properly and are properly
caulked so that cold air is not seeping in around them. Also, take
steps to lower the humidity inside the house. If you have a
humidifier on the furnace try turning it down, or even turning it
off completely for awhile. Make certain your clothes dryer is
vented directly to the outside and that there are exhaust fans in
the kitchen and in each bathroom that also vent directly to the
outside. If the problem persists you can also install plastic storm
window kits on the inside of each window (kits for this purpose are
sold in most home centers and hardware stores).

THE $44,100 PICKLE BOTTLE 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Conn., Pa.)  (js) 
 By KATHLEEN MOLONEY   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   ``Did you hear about the guy who bought an old pickle bottle for
$30 at Brimfield and sold it on Ebay for $32,000?'' That was the
buzz at a flea market in Adamstown, Pa., earlier this month. It was
almost the truth.
</P>
<P>
   The pickle bottle wasn't bought at Brimfield, the popular
antiques market in Massachusetts, but it was sold on Ebay, the
Internet auction site. The pickle bottle actually cost only $3, and
it sold for $44,100.
</P>
<P>
   The seller, Richard Rushton-Clem of Lewisburg, Pa., picked it up
at a plain old tag sale in western Massachusetts last summer. ``I
used to have an antiques shop in Kennebunkport, so I realized it
was an unusual bottle,'' Rushton-Clem said. ``I figured it was
worth $300 or $400.'' He kept the pickle bottle (a term that among
bottle collectors is interchangeable with the more familiar
``pickle jar'') on a windowsill for eight months. Then he asked the
proprietors of the Rollermills Antique Center in Lewisburg to sell
it for him on Ebay. It was listed as an ``early blown glass
cathedral pickle bottle,'' with a minimum bid of $9.99. The
reserve, which is not disclosed to prospective bidders, was set at
$275.
</P>
<P>
   According to Jim Persing, the man who runs Rollermills Internet,
a consignment service run by the antique center, the response was
immediate. ``An hour after we put the bottle on Ebay, a guy called,
all excited, and asked me to tell him more,'' he said. ``After I
answered his questions, he told me we had something really rare _
the 11-inch amber Willington pickle bottle.'' The bottle was made
in Willington, Conn., in about 1850. ``By the end of the day,''
Persing said, ``we were at $2,500, and the bottle was in a locked
case.''
</P>
<P>
   Within days bottle collectors from four different states had
visited Rollermills to see the pickle bottle. First on the scene
was John C. Mosman of Waterbury, Conn. (Ebay name: Pickleman).
Mosman described the bottle as a must-have piece because of its
color, provenance and condition. ``Amber is the rarest of all the
colors,'' he said in a post-auction interview, ``and Willington is
the only glasshouse who made Gothic cathedral pickle jars in the
amber coloration.'' In addition, he said, the jar was in perfect
condition. ``This was the top example of what you're going to get
in that size,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Jim Hagenbuch, the publisher of Antique Bottle and Glass
Collector magazine, agreed. ``No question,'' he said. ``The amber
Willington is the Cadillac of the category.'' Willington's pickle
bottles came in three sizes, 8, 11 and 14 inches. According to
Norman C. Heckler, who has been a bottle auctioneer for 38 years,
the 11-inch version is probably the rarest _ only five are known to
survive _ and this was the first time an 11-inch Willington pickle
bottle was offered at public auction. ``They just don't come to the
market,'' Heckler said.
</P>
<P>
   During the weeklong auction, which ended on March 31, there were
57 bids. Pickleman stopped at $27,999, but four other people kept
going. The high bidder, a Pennsylvania doctor with a substantial
bottle collection, would not speak to a reporter. But Roger Long,
who did the bidding for him, said the buyer could not be happier
with his $44,100 purchase.
</P>
<P>
   ``I probably shouldn't say this,'' Long said, ``but he was
prepared to go higher.''
</P>
<P>
   The seller is more than a little pleased, as well. After Ebay
takes its 2.5 percent commission and Rollermills then deducts 20
percent, Rushton-Clem walks away with a cool $34,395 profit.

My loyalty can't be bought, but the lease is up for renewal 
(For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By BRIAN MELTON 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   One might assume that writing a beer column is just about the
greatest job in the galaxy; one would assume correctly. However,
it's not without its downside. For example, several people have
already voiced their concern about calories: ``Aren't you worried
about gaining weight?''
</P>
<P>
   Not really. I'm already a fat slob, so I don't care. What's
another 10 or 20 pounds?
</P>
<P>
   No, what really concerns me is this: Every week, I sample new
brews, and every week, I find new favorites. My former fierce
loyalty to two or three stalwarts has been shaken to its core, and
I wonder: Am I becoming a fickle foam fanatic?
</P>
<P>
   Case in point: A couple of weeks back, I sang the praises of
Paulaner, a longtime favorite, even going so far as to call it
Germany's finest, in my opinion. Darn good thing I added that
little caveat, because my fickleness is in full bloom.
</P>
<P>
   The cause of my treachery? A delightful little pilsner called
Warsteiner.
</P>
<P>
   Brewed by the Cramer family since 1753 in Warstein, Germany, it
bills itself as the top-selling beer in Germany, and from the first
sip, its distinctiveness seems to bear out its boast. Washing over
the tongue with a clean, refreshing and delicate balance of hops
and malt, Warsteiner finishes smoothly, with the perfect trace of
bitterness. As an aperitif, it stands boldly, but without the
overpowering rudeness of some better-known import lagers. As an
accompaniment to meals, Warsteiner's crystal-golden character
assumes complexity without sacrificing body or crispness.
</P>
<P>
   To my mind, this flexibility and all-around ease of use makes
Warsteiner the perfect brew for springtime backyard barbecues or
just loafing around (my personal favorite). I hereby give
Warsteiner the ``good sport'' award for beers and announce to all
that it's my New Best Friend.
</P>
<P>
   For this week, at least. Stay tuned.

ATLAS BURPED, OR `WHY CAN'T WE ALL JUST GET ALONG?'
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients)

c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   What's the best beer in the world?
</P>
<P>
   There's a question guaranteed to start a brawl. When it comes to
beer, mutual-assurance pacts between sovereign nations go right out
the window. We're talkin' WAR here, folks.
</P>
<P>
   Think I'm kidding? I invited two friends, Dieter from Munich and
Richard from Sheffield (don't call him Dick), over to Melton Manor
one night to sample their country's respective brews. Aiming for
cultural harmony, I provided an internationally diverse menu of
appetizers: English Stilton, chubby smoked Deutsche knackwurst and
San Francisco sourdough.
</P>
<P>
   Dieter won the coin toss, and we enjoyed a lively Bitburger
pilsner from Germany. The convivial conversation proved
encouraging. But then, perhaps unfairly, considering the
Bitburger's lightness, we poured a Guinness Extra Stout from
Ireland.
</P>
<P>
   ``Muddy water,'' Dieter opined dismissively. Richard bristled
and said, ``I think you mean full-bodied.''
</P>
<P>
   Dieter stiffened. ``I think I mean vulgar.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Boy howdy, this cheese sure goes well with the sausage,'' I
offered brightly.
</P>
<P>
   Dieter ignored me. ``British beers are assaults to the taste
buds. German beers are uniformly subtle and graceful.''
</P>
<P>
   Popping a chunk of Stilton, Richard replied, ``German beers are
overengineered. British beers are individualistic and expressive.''
</P>
<P>
   ``How 'bout them Cowboys?'' I asked pathetically.
</P>
<P>
   ``You know,'' Dieter reflected, ``we engineer things to be their
best. Take our Messerschmidt 109s. They outperformed your Spitfires
over the channel during the war.''
</P>
<P>
   Omigod.
</P>
<P>
   ``That may be,'' Richard replied. ``But as you'll notice, we
won. Chalk it up to British spirit.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Or British conceit,'' Dieter countered.
</P>
<P>
   ``Pipe down, both of you,'' I interjected. ``Us Yanks kicked you
Brits in 1776 and 1812, then wiped Deutschland all uber the place
in 1918 and 1945. Let's forget this nonsense and enjoy a nice
Miller High Life, whattaya say?''
</P>
<P>
   ``American beer?'' they chimed in unison. ``Bah, humbug,'' said
Dieter. ``Machts nichts,'' said Richard. They beamed at each other,
new-found allies against a common enemy.
</P>
<P>
   I threw them both out, popped a Miller and watched a ``World at
War'' rerun. Sure enough, we won big-time. Again.
</P>
<P>
   Miller High Life may not be individualistic or engineered, but
it's light, refreshing and even has the beginnings of complexity.
Best of all, it's cheap. And American.
</P>
<P>
   The best beer in the world? As Patton might have said, ``The one
in your hand, moron.''

DESIGNING IN THE SMILE 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: N.Y., Calif., Texas, Germany, Sweden) (js) 
 By PHIL PATTON   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   It came as a disappointment to the executives of Lufthansa when
marketing surveys showed that the German airline was respected for
its fine record of safety and punctuality, but not liked.
Specifically, customers noted that the airline's flight attendants
rarely smiled.
</P>
<P>
   Coaching smiles out of the staff proved frustrating; an
alternative remedy was more successful. Lufthansa went to
Frogdesign, a company founded in Germany with offices in New York,
California and Texas, dedicated to what it calls ``integrated
strategic design and communications.'' Airlines have always
resorted to designers; Henry Dreyfuss and Raymond Loewy did full
redesigns for several airlines, right down to the forks and sugar
packages.
</P>
<P>
   Increasing competition among airlines has led many of them to
call the designers back in. This time, however, designers are being
asked not just to redo seats or dishes, but to reshape the
experience of flying, from check-in to luggage retrieval.
</P>
<P>
   ``The goal must be to design the whole journey,'' Frogdesign's
chief executive, Hartmut Esslinger, wrote of the Lufthansa project
for the German magazine Form. Recent redesigns by Scandinavian
Airlines, Cathay Pacific and others also show a new experiential,
almost New Age impulse.
</P>
<P>
   Designing the journey is a form of soothing the traveler. Many
airlines, including Lufthansa, offer showers in business and
first-class lounges. John Pawson's lounge in Hong Kong for Cathay
Pacific goes further. It includes a stream running through its
granite floor _ what a mall developer would call a ``water
feature.''
</P>
<P>
   Lufthansa's new look, which had its premiere last fall in
Frankfurt, will be showing up later this year at airports around
the world, including Kennedy International in New York. It aims to
evoke the romance of the early days of aviation. ``We call it
`retro futurist,''' said Sonja Schiefer of Frogdesign's New York
office.
</P>
<P>
   The design theme takes its keynote from the corrugated metal of
the Junkers Ju-52 airliners that Lufthansa flew in the early 1930s.
The metal covers the walls at check-in counters and lends its shape
to new seats. It appears as background on the Web page where
customers can make reservations. Frogdesign used the Junkers'
curves in the walls of the lounges, along with Josef Hoffmann-style
chairs appropriate to a waiting room of the Weimar Republic.
</P>
<P>
   The same curve, Ms. Schiefer said, was used at the check-in
counters, once as rigidly rectilinear as a timetable. Designers
scooped out curves in the counters, physically drawing the customer
and agent closer.
</P>
<P>
   To rework a tunnel connecting terminals in Frankfurt, Frogdesign
hired Michael McDonough, a New York architect, who is a champion of
recyclable materials. He combined the corrugated metal and the
conceit of going back in time to produce a ``time tunnel,'' where
lights, sounds and even odors, wafted through ventilators, vary as
pedestrians pass.
</P>
<P>
   Like Lufthansa, SAS has introduced a ``rebranding'' aimed at
warming its public image. The job went to the Stockholm Design Lab,
which refined the logo, changed colors _ the dominant blue has been
brightened and made ``happier,'' the designers say _ and created
new lounges in softened Scandinavian style. They used Kaj Frank
glassware and Bang &AMP; Olufsen television sets but otherwise tried to
convey ``the character of a generous Scandinavian home.'' For the
airplane toilets they deployed Swedish birch _ and added windows.
</P>
<P>
   The physical redesigns at both airlines coincide with more
customized service. Customers choose when they want to eat, for
instance, so the meal no longer arrives just as they begin to doze.
But the overall ambition seems to be projecting, by physical and
social ambiance, some enveloping version of a smile.
</P>
<P>
   ``Once, the motto was, `Let us show you,''' Esslinger said.
``Today, the slogan is `We like you, and together we will have a
really great experience.'''
</P>
<P>
   Now, design aims at not just body and mind but spirit. On the
pods that hold the jet engines and beside the doors, the SAS
designers added lines of poetry. Where it usually says, ``Push here
for emergency slide release,'' the traveler may read lines such as,
``Some travel in their minds, some travel in their heart.'' It
might make even a flight attendant smile.

TEEN GETS A PIZZA THE ACTION WITH HIS OWN EATERY
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients)

c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   FORT WORTH, Texas _ When Mike Salerno was 5 years old, he asked
his mother to take him to McDonald's so he could apply for a job.
Mom was busy making dinner, so, in the dark, Mike took off down
Beach Street to speak to the manager. Halfway there, his father
caught up with him.
</P>
<P>
   ``His dad took him on down there,'' says Mike's mom, Aurora
Jackson, ``and the manager said he was exactly the kind of employee
he looks for, but he was just a little too young.''
</P>
<P>
   At 9 years old, Mike applied for an American Express card,
listing his $2-a-week allowance as his income. American Express
politely declined his application, stating that his current income
was insufficient.
</P>
<P>
   At 12, he started busing tables at Italy Pasta &AMP; Pizza, a
restaurant owned by his uncle. That led to kitchen work and
whatever he could learn in between making pizzas.
</P>
<P>
   Now 18, with more than five years of restaurant experience
(''that might not sound like a lot to you, but it's a big part of
my life''), Salerno decided to strike out on his own.
</P>
<P>
   He pulled together money from relatives, friends and savings.
With ``enough to buy a new car,'' he bought a pizza oven, beverage
machines, plates, flatware, banquettes and tablecloths, and signed
a lease with the partners who own the Western Hills Motel and
coffee shop on Camp Bowie Boulevard in Fort Worth. This year, he
opened Mike Salerno's Italian Restaurant.
</P>
<P>
   He supervises the staff, buys supplies, tosses pizzas and does
the books.
</P>
<P>
   Salerno says he gets a lot of help from his mother and his
father, Victor Salerno. That doesn't mean he isn't at the
restaurant most days from 11 a.m. to 11 p.m., trying to study in
between busy spells. He's hoping to make enough money to continue
at Texas Wesleyan University in Fort Worth, where he is a freshman
majoring in economics.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm just the pizza guy,'' Salerno says. ``The executive chef
is Ernie Tortofelli'' (whom Salerno took with him, in the best
tradition of restaurants, from Italy Pasta &AMP; Pizza).
</P>
<P>
   But as the pizza guy, Salerno also jumps in when the cash
register clogs up, cooks when the chef is out and delivers food
when the wait staff is stretched.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just love his entrepreneurial spirit,'' says Fort Worth
Theater actor and regular customer Steve Garrett. ``I think it's
great that here is a young man without an attitude who is taking
this on.''
</P>
<P>
   With a menu that ranges from baked ziti ($4.95) to veal
parmigiana ($7.95) to calamari salad ($4.95), it might take Salerno
a while to make his mark.
</P>
<P>
   But if American Express is smart, the next time this boy comes
knocking, he'll get a credit card.
</P>
<P>
   Here are recipes from Chef Ernie Tortofelli of Mike Salerno's
Italian Restaurant.
</P>
<P>
   POLLO ALLA VENECIA
</P>
<P>
   Serves 2
</P>
<P>
   Olive oil
</P>
<P>
   8-ounce chicken breast cut in half, tenderized and floured
</P>
<P>
   1 cup green onions, chopped

</P>
<P>
   8 ounces chicken stock
</P>
<P>
   4 to 5 ounces pasta of choice, dry weight, cooked according to
package instructions
</P>
<P>
   Add enough olive oil to cover the bottom of the pan. Once the
oil is hot (almost to the point of smoking), add the tenderized
chicken to the oil. Once it has changed from pink to white, flip
and saute, then drain the oil from the chicken. Add the vegetables
and butter. Place the chicken on top of the vegetables to prevent
it from burning. Saute the vegetables until they have become soft.
Add the red wine, let the wine flame (if using a gas stove) and
come to a boil, then add the chicken stock to the pan.
</P>
<P>
   Let it come to a boil again. Remove the chicken and put it on
the serving plate. Remove the vegetables and place them on top of
the chicken. Pour half the sauce on the top of the vegetables and
chicken. Place the pan back on the stove and bring remaining sauce
to a boil. Add hot pasta to the sauce, mix, and place the pasta on
the plate.

 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   CHICAGO _ Catherine Hamilton, president of the American Friends
of Versailles, has spent 18 months losing sleep in her penthouse, a
10,000-square-foot duplex designed around a collection of
18th-century paneled rooms imported from France.
</P>
<P>
   The reason for her insomnia is Le Bal de Versailles, a six-day
extravaganza of Sun King proportions she is organizing in France to
raise $4.5 million to restore the Bosquet des Trois Fontaines, the
derelict garden masterpiece at the palace.
</P>
<P>
   You'd lose sleep, too, if you had to figure out how to make
$25,000 contributors feel more important than $5,000 ones and
$500,000 donors feel superior to the $125,000 ones, not to mention
the $1 million donor who must be made to feel as omnipotent as
Louis XIV surveying his beloved gardens from the wheelchair to
which he was confined by gout.
</P>
<P>
   Listen to Mrs. Hamilton, who doesn't speak much French but
spends a good deal of time at Chateau St.-Georges Motel, the
17th-century mansion she and her husband, David, a Chicago
businessman, also own outside Paris:
</P>
<P>
   ``For $5,000 they get five events, four tax-deductible,'' she
said, sitting in the carved and gilded Louis XV dining room of her
apartment on Lake Shore Drive, puffing on a Virginia Slim, lit with
a tasseled lighter.
</P>
<P>
   ``They get champagne in the bosquet and barbecue at my house,
but they don't get a fabulous cocktail party at Sandy's,'' she
said, referring to the grand Paris socialite Jean de Yturbe and her
important 16th-century home, Chateau d'Anet. ``For $75,000, I think
they get their name on a plaque, but if they spend $500,000, they
can have one of the three fountains named after them. They get
invited to Ambassador Rohatyn's for a seated lunch for $10,000. But
they do not get the state dinner at Trianon Palace with drinks
where Louis XV used to have strawberries and cream.''
</P>
<P>
   The fete begins June 23 in Paris with dinner at Baron Guy de
Rothschild's. (Yours for $50,000 and up.) Until then, Mrs. Hamilton
_ a warm, down-to-earth Texan who isn't the sort to turn to you and
sigh, ``tres amusant, n'est-ce pas?'' _ has been making the grand
tour among Francophile friends in places like Greenwich, Conn., and
West Palm Beach, Fla., a retinue of moneyed Mrs.-es _ Mrs. Winston
Guest, Mrs. Christopher Getty _ she calls ``the most extraordinary
people, generally quiet people, people of substance.''
</P>
<P>
   Over champagne, and often accompanied by Olivier, the Vicomte de
Rohan, who is president of Les Amis de Versailles, she'll talk
about the American connection to Versailles: of Benjamin Franklin
raising money to support the American Revolution, the 2 million
American visitors a year, the fact that, unlike Americans, the
French don't get tax credits for charity.
</P>
<P>
   The French government contributes about $47 million a year to
maintain the palace. Between 1975 and 1985, it spent $50 million to
restore the ground-floor rooms and paneling, bringing them back to
their 1789 appearance. But according to the Vicomte de Rohan, there
are no funds for reconstruction or ``anything that is a dream.''
</P>
<P>
   The rescue was begun by a young American doughboy named John D.
Rockefeller Jr., who gave $130 million between 1923 and 1936 to
restore and stabilize what was then an abandoned chateau. Since
then, Versailles has been a magnet for American philanthropists.
</P>
<P>
   ``They have nothing to lose and everything to gain,'' said
Mireille Johnston, a French writer and broadcaster on cultural
affairs. ``Versailles is a way for them to celebrate elegance and
power through objects, which is truly what they themselves are all
about.''
</P>
<P>
   The recipient of rich Americans' current affection is the
Bosquet des Trois Fontaines _ the Grove of the Three Fountains _
which is considered a triumph of design and hydraulics, though it
is now an overgrown ruin neglected for 200 years. It epitomized
``La Gloire'' and the undiluted genius of its designer, Andre Le
Notre, who defined the French formal garden and, along with a
legion of ruinously expensive craftsmen, imposed geometric order on
nature's most fluid creations: water and trees.
</P>
<P>
   There were 15 bosquets tucked into Versailles' expansive gardens
_ hidden groves with concealed pools surrounded by thick woods.
They were created to please the senses, with clever water tricks
designed to amuse the king's courtiers. Here, writes Versailles'
chief architect today, Pierre-Andre Lablaude, in ``The Gardens of
Versailles'' (Editions Scala, 1998), Louis XIV sought to ``imprint
the image of himself as a demigod in a garden where all was his.''
</P>
<P>
   The Bosquet des Trois Fontaines, visible from the newly restored
portrait galleries in the north wing, is notable for its simplicity
and lack of architectural and sculptural decoration. It featured
three successive descending terraces with three pools, each a
different shape. Within each pool gushed a water jet in the form of
a spear, vault or spray. It is the only bosquet in whose design Le
Roi himself is believed to have had a hand. ``Was it the pencil or
the intention?'' Lablaude mused in a telephone interview. ``Nobody
knows. But it's the one bosquet where the King was very involved in
the conception.''
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   The delivery of water to 2,000 fountains was a megalomaniac
effort that at one point involved a scheme (a failure) to reroute a
tributary of the Seine. In the end, Lablaude writes, water had to
be parsimoniously meted out by fountain controllers, who turned the
valves on when the king approached and off when he left, ``only to
be thrown into a panic when he sometimes took an unforeseen route,
either out of malice or by mistake.'' Today at Versailles a system
of small lakes and 175 miles of canals carry 8.3 million gallons of
water by gravity over 28,600 acres.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike other bosquets, the Trois Fontaines escaped zealous
redesign in the late 17th century by Francois Mansart, Le Notre's
nemesis, who, Lablaude said, wanted to see gardens eclipsed by
marble.
</P>
<P>
   When it was built, Versailles cost about 1 percent of the French
national budget. The restoration of the bosquet is a less expensive
affair. In 1990, a storm destroyed more than 1,500 trees, bringing
to public attention the deterioration of many parts of the garden
and prompting an ambitious 20-year program to restore the park. In
the late 1980's, with $6 million in public and private money, the
French government recreated the Bosquet d'Encelade (1675), a riot
of trellises, foliage benches and fountains decorated with gilded
shells.
</P>
<P>
   The bosquet, Lablaude said, will be restored ``using ancient
soldering techniques few artisans know today,'' including bronze
faucets and copper nozzles. Preliminary excavations have revealed
vestiges of original elements from the two upper pools as well as
the marble ramps built for Louis XIV's wheelchair. Suburban
development near the palace in the 1970's and 1980's resulted in
the destruction of the original hydraulics, which must now be
reconnected.
</P>
<P>
   ``The king never had enough water to exhaust his wishes,''
Lablaude said. ``And our biggest problem today is that there is not
enough water.''
</P>
<P>
   To Mrs. Hamilton, Versailles is a monument that, in spite of (or
perhaps because of) its excesses, belongs to the world.
</P>
<P>
   ``Beauty inspires people,'' she said, wending her way down her
apartment's grand marble staircase, made by four French
stonemasons, leading to pedestaled marble figures depicting the
four seasons. ``It's about keeping up a level of the culture.''
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Hamilton, who is flirting with the idea of going into the
boiserie business and who started Sotheby's Midwest office in
Chicago, first visited France as a young woman on a grand tour.
</P>
<P>
   She has been personally inspired by Versailles: after living for
12 years in an apartment once owned by P.K. Wrigley, she and her
husband, who made his fortune in the food service and trucking
businesses, gutted the dark Tudor interiors evocative of Vincent
Price and completely redid the apartment to fit their collection of
18th-century French paneled rooms, down to the last centimeter,
finishing them off with parquet de Versailles on the floors. Their
dishwasher is paneled. The dining room was modeled on Mme. du
Barry's low-ceiling apartments on the top floor of the palace.
``She gave us the courage to do a room with low ceilings,'' she
said.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, neither Madame nor the king had computerized climate
controls, especially for paneling, that can be set to vacation
mode.
</P>
<P>
   The apartment, dressed in ancien regime silks, contains numerous
objects once owned by Consuelo Vanderbilt. She also once owned the
Hamiltons' chateau, which Winston Churchill frequently visited. (He
loved painting the tall pink-brick manse, its two towers surrounded
by a double moat.) At Versailles, she continued, ``the arts reached
its absolute height.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've enjoyed a lot of the French culture,'' she added, citing
wine, couture, pastry, perfumes and Impressionism.
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Hamilton, 51, said she was prompted to crusade for the
bosquet, which is now consuming every waking moment, ``because
everyone always thinks `they' will do it.''
</P>
<P>
   ``But when you get to a certain age,'' she said, ``you realize
the `they' is you.''
</P>
<P>
   She is particularly excited about the black-tie state dinner in
the gallery of the Grand Trianon, where French horners will
announce dinner. ``It's going to be perfection,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   The affair will recall the grand fetes of Louis XIV, who served
56-course dinners culminating in huge explosions of fireworks and
rockets outlining his monogram in the night sky.
</P>
<P>
   Like the king's pruners, Mrs. Hamilton's must now apply the
social shears. ``Darlin','' she said, turning to an assistant, ``we
need to get rid of the Z list.''

My loyalty can't be bought, but the lease is up for renewal 
(For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By BRIAN MELTON 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   One might assume that writing a beer column is just about the
greatest job in the galaxy; one would assume correctly. However,
it's not without its downside. For example, several people have
already voiced their concern about calories: ``Aren't you worried
about gaining weight?''
</P>
<P>
   Not really. I'm already a fat slob, so I don't care. What's
another 10 or 20 pounds?
</P>
<P>
   No, what really concerns me is this: Every week, I sample new
brews, and every week, I find new favorites. My former fierce
loyalty to two or three stalwarts has been shaken to its core, and
I wonder: Am I becoming a fickle foam fanatic?
</P>
<P>
   Case in point: A couple of weeks back, I sang the praises of
Paulaner, a longtime favorite, even going so far as to call it
Germany's finest, in my opinion. Darn good thing I added that
little caveat, because my fickleness is in full bloom.
</P>
<P>
   The cause of my treachery? A delightful little pilsner called
Warsteiner.
</P>
<P>
   Brewed by the Cramer family since 1753 in Warstein, Germany, it
bills itself as the top-selling beer in Germany, and from the first
sip, its distinctiveness seems to bear out its boast. Washing over
the tongue with a clean, refreshing and delicate balance of hops
and malt, Warsteiner finishes smoothly, with the perfect trace of
bitterness. As an aperitif, it stands boldly, but without the
overpowering rudeness of some better-known import lagers. As an
accompaniment to meals, Warsteiner's crystal-golden character
assumes complexity without sacrificing body or crispness.
</P>
<P>
   To my mind, this flexibility and all-around ease of use makes
Warsteiner the perfect brew for springtime backyard barbecues or
just loafing around (my personal favorite). I hereby give
Warsteiner the ``good sport'' award for beers and announce to all
that it's my New Best Friend.
</P>
<P>
   For this week, at least. Stay tuned.

<P>
   The former New Yorkers were tanned and rested, but in revolt.
The city of Miami Beach was testing 20 new parking meters. ``Smart
meters,'' the city called them, proudly deploying them on busy
Washington Avenue. The former New Yorkers called them something
unprintable.
</P>
<P>
   That was because the meters had infrared eyes that let them
``see'' when a car pulled out of the space and reset the time on
the meter to zero, denying the next customer the beat-the-system
thrill of finding a few free minutes on the dial. To try to make up
for it, the city set the machines to allow a five-minute grace
period before a vehicle became, in the euphemistic jargon of the
meter readers, ``ticket eligible.''
</P>
<P>
   Nice try. John A. Todaro, who once lived in New York but is now
a parking superintendent in Miami Beach, was charged with fielding
complaints.
</P>
<P>
   ``We explained that they were getting five minutes free,''
Todaro said, ``but they wanted somebody else's half-hour.''
</P>
<P>
   In part because of the uproar, the city removed the meters, but
the extra money they could generate is tempting for Miami Beach and
other municipalities. Just as the formerly indignant now find
themselves meekly following voice-mail directions, people may find
themselves dealing with such meters in cities across the country
within three to four years, authorities on parking say.
</P>
<P>
   Cities may prove willing to swallow a few months of criticism in
return for the windfall that would be produced by the meters that
taketh away.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm telling people the only free parking will be on a Monopoly
board,'' said Kim E. Jackson, a director at the International
Parking Institute, a trade association in Fredericksburg, Va.
</P>
<P>
   When the intelligent parking meters were tested at 50 spaces in
the Bronx and Queens about a year ago, they became notorious for
their unforgiving souls, or at least for their unforgiving
microchips.
</P>
<P>
   The New York City test, on Morris Park Avenue in the Bronx and
Steinway Street in Queens, lasted just three months before the
meters were pulled out in February 1998 as too unreliable. Still,
Richard Matarangelo, a former supervisor at the city's Department
of Transportation who helped coordinate the test, said the meters
were promising.
</P>
<P>
   The man to blame for this new nuisance is Vincent G. Yost, 46,
an inventor who said he had come up with the idea for smart meters
in 1994 when he was selling electronic cash registers and failed to
talk his way out of a ticket after a sales call in Philadelphia.
</P>
<P>
   ``I told the meter reader that it had just expired, and she said
she had no way of knowing that,'' Yost said. ``I thought, `Geez,
she's right. There must be a better way.'''
</P>
<P>
   So Yost, the president of Intelligent Devices of Harleysville,
Pa., came up with a meter that does not lie and does tattle. It
uses heat sensors, motion detectors and an infrared eye to sense
when a car moves, how long it has been parked and how many minutes
have ticked away after the metered time has expired.
</P>
<P>
   His ``better way'' has taken awhile. Yost's smart meter is in
its third version, and he admits that the first two prototypes did
not work very well. ``With the first generation,'' he said, ``you
could fool it by someone simply walking by.''
</P>
<P>
   Yost said he had solved the early mechanical problems and now
used ``slot-machine-quality'' parts. A smart meter costs about
$200, compared with about $150 for a regular meter. The company
says its studies show that the smart meter can increase parking
revenue by about 25 percent if the meter resets to zero when the
car leaves the parking space. That would create a large boon for
New York City, which has 71,872 meters that collected $70.9 million
in the last fiscal year.
</P>
<P>
   The latest incarnation is so smart that it might be called the
Mensa meter. The window can display 10 symbols to convey
information about the vehicle that is parked there and the
condition of the meter itself. Maintenance workers would carry
hand-held computers that would allow local officials to chart
occupancy rates, the average parking time and other information
that used to be compiled by hired consultants. Eventually,
Intelligent Devices hopes to make meters that will send data
electronically.

   Several other meter makers are testing similar models, industry
officials say. POM Inc. of Russellville, Ark., built a prototype of
what it calls a ``self-zeroing meter,'' a model that sits in the
office of the company's president, Skeeter Ward.
</P>
<P>
   Bobra L. Wilbanks, POM's technical sales manager, said in a
telephone interview that cities were worried about complaints from
the public and about how to answer the challenges that might result
from tickets based on an electronic, rather than a human, eye.
</P>
<P>
   To make its technology seem friendlier, Intelligent Devices is
offering another feature. Because the meter knows when a car parks
or leaves, it can dispense free minutes _ typically five _ when the
car pulls in, giving the driver enough time to find change or get a
cup of coffee.
</P>
<P>
   Doylestown, Pa., is using that feature for the 325 meters it
plans to begin installing this spring at a cost of $125,000, which
includes a year of service.
</P>
<P>
   Ruth Eynon, who at 61 is the dean of the Doylestown
parking-meter enforcers, hears as many indignant excuses from
delinquent parkers as a state trooper hears from speeders. Whether
it is the woman who said she had forgotten the meter because she
had been in labor (that excuse worked), or the folks who said they
had been held up in court or had become caught up in a conversation
(those excuses did not), almost all the violators have one thing in
common: their emphatic assertion that the meter expired just
seconds ago.
</P>
<P>
   ``It must've just popped,'' they say over and over all day long,
and Mrs. Eynon has to play Carnac, trying to figure out just how
old the red ``Time Expired'' flag is. She hopes that the smart
meters will reduce the number of daily confrontations.
</P>
<P>
   Sensing the potential public-relations drawbacks to the smart
meter, some cities _ including Doylestown _ are planning to disable
the return-to-zero time feature, allowing residents to continue
savoring the quiet thrill of the freeloader.
</P>
<P>
   ``We think it's your right as an American,'' said John H. Davis,
the Doylestown borough manager. ``If you can scarf someone else's
meter time, God bless you.''
</P>
<P>
   These cities say that they are willing to forgo added revenue
from the smart meter and that it is still useful to them. The smart
meter can be programmed to require that a car leave the parking
space before more money is accepted. Municipal officials say that
encourages people to shop in struggling downtowns because it forces
turnover at the meters instead of allowing one shopper _ or even a
store employee _ to hoard a parking space.
</P>
<P>
   For the determined scofflaw, the smart meters present less
violent possibilities than Paul Newman found in his 1967 role as
Lucas Jackson in ``Cool Hand Luke,'' when he went on a spree with a
pipe cutter, lopping off the heads of parking meters with the
succinct explanation, ``Small town, not much to do.''
</P>
<P>
   When several of Doylestown's meters stopped working during a
recent test, a trip to the street revealed the culprit _ gum in the
motion sensor. An Intelligent Devices technician applied an equally
low-tech solution: He scraped it off.
</P>
<P>
   Another idea being tested in several places is a meter that uses
a ``smart card'' sold at hotels and grocery stores. Some of POM's
smart-card meters have a feature called ``Refund-a-Card,'' which
allows parkers to put extra time back on their cards before pulling
away.
</P>
<P>
   With other meters, early departers are out of luck _ leaving a
few free minutes for any driver who might happen along.

PIANIST KRYSTIAN ZIMERMAN PLAYS BY HIS OWN RULES
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By WAYNE LEE GAY 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Krystian Zimerman avoids plane travel, and he wouldn't dream of
playing the 100 or so concerts that other pianists perform each
year.
</P>
<P>
   ``I never play more than 50 in one season,'' he says. ``And
that's on the edge for me. I should play more, but I can't.''
</P>
<P>
   Although Fort Worth has become one of the five or so essential
places on the continent where any touring pianist must appear,
Zimerman, 42, had never performed there. That changed this week,
when he performed on the Cliburn series at Bass Performance Hall.
</P>
<P>
   Rumor has it that Zimerman happened to hear a Cliburn
Competition medalist refer to him in a TV interview as one of the
great pianists of our time, which made him amenable to being booked
on the Cliburn series.
</P>
<P>
   Zimerman, however, says that he worked Fort Worth into his
current North American tour _ in spite of travel difficulties _
because of his immense respect for Cliburn Foundation Executive
Director Richard Rodzinski.
</P>
<P>
   ``Richard Rodzinski is one of the most important people in
American concert life,'' Zimerman says. ``He's one of 30 or so
people who make American concert life what it is.''
</P>
<P>
   Zimerman is traveling by car, accompanied by his personal piano
technician _ and his personal piano. Although most pianists play
whatever instrument is available, Zimerman insists that traveling
with one's own piano is sensible.
</P>
<P>
   ``I always take my own toothbrush when I travel, too,'' he says.
``It's not a question of whether the local pianos are good or bad,
but how much time you have to get used to one. A violinist takes
three months to get used to a new instrument.''
</P>
<P>
   Only a few top-echelon pianists _ such as Van Cliburn _ insist
on transporting a familiar piano to all concerts, even to the point
of shipping an instrument overseas by air. Although his technician
also travels with him, Zimerman does the final regulating and
voicing of the piano, using fluids and needles to fine-tune the
density of the felt hammers.
</P>
<P>
   Zimerman calls the Steinway grand that travels with him ``an old
friend,'' and says that it is particularly suited in tone and touch
for the music of Chopin and Schumann.
</P>
<P>
   The Chopin half of his Fort Worth program included the grand,
largely cheerful Scherzo No. 2, the Impromptu in F, the Fantaisie
in F minor and three Mazurkas. Polish-born Zimerman won
international fame when, as the youngest of 118 competitors, he
took first prize in the 1975 Chopin Competition.
</P>
<P>
   ``The feeling about Chopin is that he didn't write any bad
music,'' Zimerman says. ``He didn't destroy his bad music, like
some composers, because he didn't write any.''
</P>
<P>
   Zimerman admits that the current view of Schumann is somewhat
different _ and that the Sonata No. 1 is not always placed on the
list of that composer's undisputed masterpieces.
</P>
<P>
   ``I played this piece about 15 years ago. I was never really
very happy about it, and had a feeling of not getting all I could
out of it. Now, I have 15 more years of experience.''
</P>
<P>
   Those 15 years include the births of two children, who live with
him on his estate in Switzerland.
</P>
<P>
   Recently, in keeping with his unusual, personalized view of what
a pianist's career should be, he has taken on piano students in a
special program at the Basle Academy. His dislike of travel
encouraged him to accept that job close to home, even though his
classes include pupils not of the top rank.
</P>
<P>
   The half-dozen pupils he accepts study an unusual curriculum
including acoustics, electronics and piano technology. They
recently assembled, from ready-made parts, three Steinway
keyboards, the better to learn the mechanics of the instrument.
Zimerman expects even the potential artists in the group to learn
how to tune a piano.

<TEXT>
<P>
   I'm conflicted. The iMac is a sensation, with more than a
million units sold since its release last August. And like a lot of
former Mac users who had made the switch to a Windows 98 PC, I have
found myself drawn, even taunted by the iMac's cool esthetic.
</P>
<P>
   It has conjured up that old Apple magic for me, that
self-righteous promise of a better-built mousetrap that not only
compelled me to use Apple computers once but also prompted me to
move west and go to work for the company.
</P>
<P>
   I bought an iMac the day it went on sale and yet, as I revise
this article on a Windows 98 personal computer, I wonder if that
magic is enough to pull me back for good.
</P>
<P>
   I was bitten by the Apple bug early. I picked strawberries on a
farm as a 16-year-old to bankroll my first Apple, a IIe. But the
Macintosh was different. I decided after seeing the famous ``1984''
Macintosh commercial during the Super Bowl that I wanted a Mac, but
I couldn't afford one.
</P>
<P>
   At the time, I was 20 and working as a computer trainer for the
Harrah's casino in Atlantic City. The Mac was a foreign language in
the casino business. I had read somewhere that Apple had given a
Mac to every new employee so I called the company and asked for a
job. I was invited to drop by if I was ever in the neighborhood.
</P>
<P>
   I called my boss at the casino and asked if he wanted to buy my
new Compaq PC. He said yes, and that he would pay me on Monday.
Floating myself the cash, I wrote a technically bad check and took
the first flight out on Friday.
</P>
<P>
   By the end of the day, I had landed a job in the information
services department at Apple. A few months later, I was introduced
to John Sculley, then the chairman of Apple. He had heard about my
enthusiasm for the Mac and my flight west. He was looking for a
technical assistant to teach him how to use the Mac and keep him
tuned in to exciting developments in the Mac world. My job was to
eat, sleep and breathe Macintosh. It was a dream job, and I stayed
with it for nearly four years.
</P>
<P>
   But somewhere in there, I had got it into my head that I wanted
to be a novelist. So I quit Apple, and after a few false starts, I
followed the advice many successful novelists give to aspiring
authors: write what you know about. I started writing about Silicon
Valley. And I started going broke.
</P>
<P>
   Around this time Windows was really taking off. Tons of games
were being written for the PC, but not so many for the Mac. I faced
a difficult decision: PC or Mac? The PC won out, for purely
economic reasons. I reviewed PC games to pay the rent. I wrote PC
and video game strategy guides. At the same time, I wrote and
rewrote my novel.
</P>
<P>
   It has been a decade since I left Apple. My novel was published
recently and is getting fair reviews. I bought myself a new Sony
Vaio PC that ran Windows 98 and was decked out with the fastest
processor, tons of memory and a powerful 3-D card that makes the
latest games look great and run smoothly. This should be the
happiest time of my life.
</P>
<P>
   But it's not, and I blame the iMac. My attraction to the ``VW
Bug of computers'' is rooted in feelings of sensuality and
sentiment. As a computer, it could be frustrating, at least when it
first came out. With no floppy drive or Zip drive connection, I
couldn't easily transfer my few novels and other writings.
</P>
<P>
   With no viable all-in-one personal information manager, like
Microsoft's Outlook 98 for Windows, I couldn't easily move over my
e-mail, contacts, schedule and task and notes information that
Outlook handles so skillfully on my PC.
</P>
<P>
   Still, my new iMac looked great, and I was enormously pleased
with how Apple's operating system upgrade, System 8.5, smoothed the
appearance of the type on the screen. The Mac's windows are
prettier than Windows' windows.
</P>
<P>
   So I went ahead and laboriously sent myself all my files via
e-mail, figuring that I would survive with my Palm Pilot as my
personal information manager until the iMac could handle that
function (which took months). Furthermore, I couldn't use my
Hewlett-Packard Laserjet 6 printer; the only choices for iMac were
ink-jet printers, which are not ideal for printing 300-page
manuscripts. I mentioned to my friends that despite these
inconveniences, I was switching back to Mac. They called me crazy.
</P>
<P>
   Then something happened. Software and hardware makers started to
become excited about providing products for the iMac. Imation began
selling a Superdisk floppy drive that also doubles as back-up
storage because it handles both regular and high-density disks.
Iomega came out with a Zip drive that works with both PCs and
iMacs.
</P>
<P>
   Palm Computing began giving away a clever contact manager that
runs on Macs. Logitech released the Quickcam Pro, a digital video
camera that works with PCs and iMacs. Infowave started selling an
adapter that makes almost any PC printer work with the iMac.
</P>
<P>
   Connectix's Virtual PC can, in a pinch, run Windows 98 on the
iMac so I can connect my Hewlett-Packard Jornada handheld computer,
which I use for writing and the Internet when I visit my family for
the weekend. But I missed my PCs wheel mouse: the iMac's mouse
turns into a slippery puck during pointing and clicking. Yet that
complaint was only a temporary one: Logitech has just started
offering a Universal Serial Bus wheel mouse for iMacs. All should
have been right in my iMac world.
</P>
<P>
   But it wasn't. I began to miss my PC. I missed the nearly
perfect Outlook 98; I even begged Microsoft to create a Mac
version. I missed being able to play the hottest games. I missed
the quicker response the PC with Windows always seems to have (my
Mac friends actually complain that ``it's too fast'').
</P>
<P>
   I especially missed the always handy right mouse button that
speeds up everyday tasks. And there is more for me to write about
in the PC world than the Mac world, and writing pays my rent.
</P>
<P>
   After 5 or 10 bouts of swapping the PC and iMac on my desk, I
finally settled on the PC. To resist the temptation of the iMac, I
gave it to a financially challenged friend who has been threatening
to write a novel of his own. It made perfect sense. He is new to
computers and carries none of the baggage _ emotional and practical
_ that I do. The iMac is perfect for him.
</P>
<P>
   I have moved past Macintosh in some very specific ways. (I read
recently that my former boss, Sculley, has himself become a PC
user.) Still, choice is good, and it's nice to see Apple making a
comeback, headed by the iMac's bright alternative to the accustomed
Windows view of the world. I should be at peace with my decision,
and I am. For now, anyway. &QL;

THE TREND'S A NONTREND

 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   HIGH POINT, N.C. _ If furniture follows fashion, then the
International Home Furnishings Market, which opened here last
Thursday and ends Friday, is a cashmere twin set: luxurious,
understated, pretty and comfortingly familiar.
</P>
<P>
   With some 75,000 visitors temporarily doubling the population of
this small Southern city, home to the world's largest furniture
market, there was plenty of excitement but not many surprises.
</P>
<P>
   ``The furniture industry had its best year ever in 1998, and
shipments are still strong,'' said Jerry Epperson, an industry
analyst. ``Factories are running full out, hiring is a problem,
fabric mills are having trouble keeping up with orders, and lumber
supplies are tight. Everybody's getting better at making fewer new
things.''
</P>
<P>
   Throughout the market's 8 million square feet of showroom space,
exhibitors struggled to put labels on their wares but could only
come up with oxymorons to describe the nontrend trends. Bernhardt
Furniture Co. unveiled a line of popularly priced upholstered
furniture it called New Vintages. Other exhibitors touted ``casual
elegance,'' ``simple luxury'' and ``retro modern.''
</P>
<P>
   Eclecticism was in the air. Baker Furniture interposed new
pieces of Michael Vanderbyl's elegantly retro designs with
reproductions from the Historic Charleston Foundation. ``We're
embracing tradition and the historical without being traditional
and historic,'' said John Black, Baker's vice president of product
development. Similarly, Hickory Chair Co., which added everything
from bureaus to garden benches from Winterthur to its repertory of
reproductions, deliberately spanned ages and continents in room
settings that borrowed from all of its collections. Larry Laslo,
one of the first and best proponents of 1950s cocktail-culture
modern, redesigned the John Widdicomb showroom, covering furniture
from its Victoria &AMP; Albert Museum collection in leather and animal
patterns. Upstairs, his own designs were low and sleek and dressed
in basket-weave chenille.
</P>
<P>
   If there was a single trend that everyone could agree on, it was
toward luxury. Mitchell Gold added to his mid-priced Platinum
furniture collection, featuring goose-down cushions. Baker
showcased sofas upholstered in silk velvet, and elsewhere, mohair
(or, at Mitchell Gold, ``mohairesque'' acrylic), suede and wool
were much in evidence. After several years of blond wood, dark rich
finishes made a strong return. ``People are buying high-performance
cars,'' Gold said. ``Now they want high-performance furniture.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   The most ubiquitous luxury was leather. Down a corridor
upholstered in cowhide, Lane Action showed off 17,000 square feet
of new sofas and chairs covered in everything from the cowhide to
embossed nubuck. Vanguard Furniture, a new licensee of Stetson,
showed boot-stitched embossed and quilted leather. MGM licensed
Classic Leather to make a Hollywood-inspired collection of Art Deco
sofas and chairs, and Baker showed its new Coach line of leather
furniture. Mulholland Brothers, a first-time exhibitor known for
its high-end luggage and accessories, offered a small collection of
handsome furniture upholstered in saddle leather.
</P>
<P>
   It was really a red meat kind of market _ from the 150-pound
bureau carved from solid Spam at Stanley Furniture's
75th-anniversary party to a triumvirate of buffed beefcake angels
in fluffy white wings who mingled with guests at Mitchell Gold's
10th-anniversary party. Lackawanna Leather, one of the industry's
major suppliers, celebrated its success with a charity auction of
celebrity-designed quilts, including a surprisingly kinky black
leather number from Martha Stewart.
</P>
<P>
   Furniture buyers' appetites also seemed to include bigger
helpings. The trend toward gigantism in new suburban homes,
especially in master bedrooms, was reflected in Brobdingnagian
furniture: an 86-inch-tall armoire at Stanley, a 90-inch-tall
Victorian-style headboard at Hooker. Other manufacturers banked on
furniture that was unabashedly pretty. Mining popular European
country looks for inspiration, many new collections _ Lexington
Furniture's Southern Living Collection, Shermag's Orleans
Collection, Rue de Provence at Highland House, Coeur de France at
Century _ spoke a kind of Esperanto that combined elements of
French, English, Spanish and American design. Lexington headed
farther north to Sweden for Solgarden, an all-white collection that
was one of the prettiest of the market's introductions.
</P>
<P>
   With the baby-boom generation comfortably in its hip pocket, the
furniture industry began eyeing the next group of spenders, the
puzzling and notoriously hard-to-corral members of 19-to
33-year-old Generation X, just coming into their nesting years.
Broyhill introduced a cheap and cheerful line unambiguously named
GX, priced so that a bed, chest, dresser and mirror combination can
retail for under $2,000.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's fast-food furniture,'' said Boyd Barnhardt, the director
of marketing. ``Everything is designed with efficiency and price in
mind.''
</P>

   But Catnapper, a mid-priced recliner company, was not quite
ready to let the baby boomers go. Demonstrating a $699 Naugahyde
chair that not only reclines but also gently lifts a sitter to his
or her feet, Don Hunter, Catnapper's vice president of
merchandising, saw a limitless future. ``With the graying of
America, we're looking ahead,'' he said. ``We think we've found a
market just waiting to be tapped.''

 &HT;    OFFICIALS PRAY, PONDER HOW TO CUT SCHOOL VIOLENCE
 &HT;    480&AMP;add.
 &HT;    By ANDREW MOLLISON
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ From the White House to Congress, federal officials
struggled Thursday to express national sorrow for the mass violence
in Littleton, Colo., and to start yet another search for ways to
increase safety in schools.
</P>
<P>
   Moments of silent prayer, meditation and condolences to the
families of the victims were led in the White House by President
Clinton and on the House floor by Speaker Dennis Hastert, R-Ill.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is a deep desire to comfort the grieving and counsel
with children,''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton said.
</P>
<P>
   Hastert, a former high school teacher and wrestling coach, had a
message for the parents of students at Columbine High School: ``As
a parent of two boys, I can only imagine the grief you are feeling
today as you try to make sense of yesterday's tragic events.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton said, ``It is very important to explain to children all
over America what has happened and to reassure our own children
that they are safe (and) to hammer home to all the children of
America that violence is wrong.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton said agents from the Federal Bureau of Investigation and
the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms were already assisting
local law enforcement authorities. School and community leaders
were offered help from grief counselors and other post-crisis
consultants at a federally supported center in Denver.
</P>
<P>
   He also cleared his schedule for Thursday, in case state and
local officials request a visit by him. He might be accompanied by
officials such as Education Secretary Richard Riley and Attorney
General Janet Reno, who last August mailed a security manual to
every one of the nation's more than 100,000 public and private
schools.
</P>
<P>
   Riley said the decision not to visit Littleton on Wednesday was
reached during late-night consultations between officials of
several departments.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it's a mistake for people like me to go soaring in
while the local people are trying to sort out the tragedy,'' Riley
said.
</P>
<P>
   Responding to requests from ``many'' senators, Chairman Jim
Jeffords, R-Vt., announced that his Senate Committee on Health,
Education, Labor and Pensions would hold hearings on school
violence in May.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Edward Kennedy, D-Mass., said the ``terrible tragedy in the
heart of the nation'' might lead to new gun control and gun safety
laws.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have 14 children die every single day from gun violence''
outside schools, Kennedy said. ``But none of us here is coming up
with a silver bullet to solve all of those problems.''
</P>
<P>
   Sen. John Ashcroft, R-Mo., said Congress and society should find
a way to counter ``a culture of violence'' that includes
literature, gangsta rap and video games.
</P>
<P>
   ``These aren't things government can have much to do with,'' he
said. But he said that parents should realize that ``disrespect for
life'' can grow out of video games in which a child ``may punch out
an opponent on a machine _ kill, kill, kill _ just by punching a
button on a computer.''
</P>
<P>
   (Story can end here. Optional add follows)
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Jeff Bingaman, D-N.M., said the Littleton violence might
increase the chances of approval of his bill requiring the Justice
Department to spend $2 million setting up a new School Security
Center at Sandia National Laboratories in his home state and giving
schools $30 million over three years to buy technology recommended
by the center.
</P>
<P>
   ``For example, by installing cameras, schools could be
forewarned of problems, and law enforcement can use those cameras
in situations like the hostage situation that occurred in
Colorado,'' Bingaman said.
</P>
<P>
   By coincidence, Wednesday was the day on which the House and
Senate overwhelmingly approved a compromise version of this year's
first education bill, which Clinton has agreed to sign.
</P>
<P>
   One short clause in the Educational Flexibility bill, which
gives schools more flexibility in spending federal funds, will make
it easier for school officials to expel a student who possesses a
gun on school property.
</P>
<P>
   Previously, some students wiggled out of expulsion by arguing
that mere possession of a gun that they might have discovered
inside a school did not prove that they had violated the federal
ban on bringing a gun onto school property.

TWO DOCTORS REVIVE A DESERT GARDEN 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Calif.)   (bl)  
 By JIM ROBBINS   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   PALM SPRINGS, Calif. _ A Mediterranean-style mansion called the
Willows, tucked into the flank of Mount San Jacinto here, was best
known in the 1950s as the home of Marion Davies, an actress famous
as the mistress of newspaper magnate William Randolph Hearst.
Before that it was known as the place where Clark Gable and Carole
Lombard stayed on their honeymoon.
</P>
<P>
   But perhaps the best reason to know the Willows is that it was
bought shortly after it was built in 1927 by Samuel Untermeyer, a
New York civil rights lawyer and passionate horticulturist.
(Untermeyer gave the Untermeyer Fountain with three maidens to
Central Park's Conservatory Garden.)
</P>
<P>
   Untermeyer, who died in 1940, had sought the California desert
for his respiratory health. At the Willows, two hours from Los
Angeles, he doted on his massive multilevel garden, decked with the
willow trees that gave his home its name. Untermeyer's guests here
included Gable and Lombard; New York City Mayor Jimmy Walker and
Albert Einstein.
</P>
<P>
   Former Palm Springs Mayor Frank Bogert remembers chatting with
Einstein. ``He was a wonderful little guy,'' said Bogert, 89. ``He
could explain his theory of relativity to a dummy like me, in a
language I could understand.''
</P>
<P>
   Between its glamorous past and the 1970s, the home fell into a
bizarre state of disrepair. Its mahogany trim was painted pink and
blue. There was shag carpeting on the floors. A Budweiser sign hung
in the dining room.
</P>
<P>
   ``The place was devastated,'' said Dr. Tracy Conrad, 36, an
emergency room doctor from Los Angeles who, with her business
partner, Dr. Paul Marut, another emergency room doctor, bought the
house in 1994, restored it and turned it into the Willows Bed and
Breakfast. ``We wanted to save it. Thank God there are people who
don't know what they're getting into, or these projects would never
get done.''
</P>
<P>
   The cost was $1 million, and by 1996, enough restoration was
completed to begin receiving guests. At the end of last year, a
$50,000 garden restoration was completed. This will be the first
spring for the new old garden, designed to flourish in the intense
summer heat on the flank of the mountain behind the Willows.
</P>
<P>
   Untermeyer amassed a fortune early in life. He also owned
Greystone Manor, a sprawling mansion in Yonkers, N.Y., where he had
60 greenhouses and 12 gardeners and grew 3,000 varieties of
orchids. When Untermeyer was staying at the Willows, he had orchids
sent to him from Yonkers once a week. Dr. Conrad honors that legacy
with an orchid in a small pot next to the beds.
</P>
<P>
   Untermeyer was responsible for terracing the garden into the
mountain, with a series of paths and steps made from granite. The
steps weave through groves of palm trees, sharp-spined cactus, and
lemon, orange and tangelo trees heavy with fruit. Most important to
Dr. Conrad was restoring the willow groves around the house with
native species, like curly willow. She sought advice from an expert
in London, who responded with a three-page, hand-written letter.
</P>
<P>
   This month, with the garden in bloom, hummingbirds hover around
the deep red bougainvillea, the lavender verbena, the yellow
flowers of the brittle brush and wild pink sweet peas. Benches and
tables offer breathtaking views of the Coachella Valley beyond. The
garden centerpiece is a 50-foot artificial waterfall, made from
tons of rock. Water is pumped to a pool at the top of the garden
and spills to a another pool 50 feet below, on the patio next to
the dining room. The cascade functions as a cooler as it mists the
home during blast-furnace summers.
</P>
<P>
   The house itself was built to withstand the heat. ``It's a house
within a house,'' Dr. Conrad said. Cement walls more than three
feet thick have a space inside that acts as insulation. The front
porch has been fitted with towering canvas curtains that can be
closed against the desert sun.
</P>
<P>
   There are eight guest rooms, which cost from $250 to $500 a
night. All have been tastefully redone, and some, like the Einstein
Garden Room, are named after former guests or owners. In the '50s,
Marion Davies owned not just the Willows but also the nearby Desert
Inn. Legend has it that she tore the kitchen out of the Willows,
put in a bar and had all her meals sent over from the inn. Today,
the Marion Davies Room has a balcony with a view of a Chinese
orchid tree. ``I picture her walking around in a pink satin gown
with a martini,'' Dr. Conrad said.
</P>
<P>
   The Rock Room, downstairs, has a bathroom that includes a large
chunk of gray and white granite protruding from the mountain. (It
once was Untermeyer's two-room wine cellar.) The Library Room, with
its carved cherry wood fireplace, was where Lombard and Gable
stayed.
</P>
<P>
   The red oak floor in the living room, a public area, has been
refinished along with the sandstone fireplace. The wrought-iron
chandelier is original. The home, listed by the State of California
as a historic site, is one of the 10 oldest in Palm Springs, built
long before the city became a testing ground for Modernist
architecture. The Willows once sat on four acres of ground, which
included a grove of citrus trees. In 1967, much of the land was
sold to create the Desert Museum, which now has a Rodin exhibition.
</P>
<P>
   The restored garden, Dr. Conrad said, is pleasing her during its
first spring. Samuel Untermeyer's great-granddaughter, Pamela
Street, remembers the Willows from childhood visits from
Connecticut in the 1960s. She revisited the home in the late '70s,
after it had been sold and carpeted in shag. She returned recently,
after the Conrad-Marut renovation, and burst into tears. ``It was
just like it had been,'' she said.

TIME IN A BOTTLE: A BOOM IN ENCAPSULATING THE PRESENT FOR
POSTERITY

 (bl)  
 By PAMELA LI CALZI O'CONNELL   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   It's time capsule time. As the new century approaches, instant
archaeology is being created by civic groups, schools, churches,
businesses and a surprising number of families and individuals who
have chosen to encapsulate the present for the presumed benefit of
the future.
</P>
<P>
   In many instances, today's time capsules differ from those of
the past. The technological obsessions of the current age have
shifted the way some now handle time capsules _ perhaps, experts
say, because technology has changed the way we think about time.
What is placed in capsules, how long they are sealed and for whom
they are earmarked may no longer be so obvious.
</P>
<P>
   Renewed interest in time capsules is attested to by
manufacturers, who report big sales increases. (A $20 ``personal''
capsule available in card stores could reach sales of tens, or
perhaps hundreds, of thousands by the end of the year.) The
Smithsonian Institution, responding to a surge in inquiries,
particularly from corporations, plans a seminar this fall on the
proper preparation of capsules. And the International Time Capsule
Society is experiencing a flurry of interest in its mission and its
registry of completed capsules, the only listing of its kind.
</P>
<P>
   ``People used to think of time capsules as sort of eccentric
kids' stuff,'' said Cathleen O'Connell, an independent filmmaker in
Seattle who is completing a documentary on the subject. ``But it's
an activity that has been legitimized by corporations, cities and
builders to an amazing degree, and it's also been democratized.
Anyone can buy their own custom-engraved capsule now.''
</P>
<P>
   While the boom in time capsules at century's end is not
surprising, what is perhaps surprising is the discussion over what
to put in them _ specifically, what information or data (and in
what format) and what ``realia,'' the term experts use for objects
that are telling indicators of an era.
</P>
<P>
   Since much of our end-of-century reality is expressed in digital
gadgets and digitized information, the discussion is that much more
interesting. The digital is ephemeral, historically speaking,
because the devices may not work in the future and the data will
degrade, some quite quickly. For instance, when stored at room
temperature, magnetic tapes can be expected to last only 20 years,
CD-ROMs for 50. So-called analog items, like acid-free paper, do a
lot better over the long term, say archivists and preservationists.
</P>
<P>
   The paradox is that while technology has never allowed a broader
spectrum of people to record more about their lives than now,
today's time capsules could prove even more irrelevant to
historians and scholars than those of the past.
</P>
<P>
   ``The more technology-dependent the contents of a capsule, the
more vulnerable,'' said Paul Hudson, a founder of the International
Time Capsule Society, at Oglethorpe University in Atlanta
(www.oglethorpe.edu/itcs). ``People should think much more simply,
much more naively, about what to put in them,'' he added. ``Sit
down and write a message to the future with a No. 2 pencil on
paper.''
</P>
<P>
   Yet such arguments may be out of step with the spirit of the
time. A recent survey sponsored by Korbel Champagne Cellars, which
has no small interest in Dec. 31, asked consumers what single item
should be included in a capsule destined for 3000. Among the top
answers was a laptop computer. And interviews with capsule planners
reveal that audio cassettes, VHS home movies, CDs of popular songs
and recordable CD-ROMs loaded with personal data and images are
prominent on millennial packing lists.
</P>
<P>
   People interested in a discussion of archival protection and
resources, prepared by the Smithsonian's Conservation Analytical
Lab, might want to visit the simsc.si.edu/cal/timecaps.html site.
</P>
<P>
   For some, there is no issue at all: shoot a video and let our
smarty-pants descendants figure out how to play it. Norman Davis,
who helped in the recent burial of a time capsule in Englewood,
N.J., to be opened in 100 years, said he had videotaped the
ceremony up to the point of burial and included it in the capsule.
``No one in 2099 will likely have a VCR, but that's their
problem,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Such attitudes are not surprising, said Gregory Benford, a
science-fiction writer, a professor of physics at the University of
California at Irvine and the author of the new book ``Deep Time:
How Humanity Communicates Across Millennia'' (Bard/Avon). ``Yes,
digital media will be unintelligible to the future,'' said Benford,
``though burying a laptop fully loaded with software is at least an
attempt to include the medium with the message.'' He added that
even in antiquity, tomb builders often enclosed their favorite
gadgets. ``Today there's a leap of faith involved that the future
will be able to figure it all out,'' he said. ``Actually, it's a
symptom of modernity, this assumption that the future will be
interested in the past at all.''
</P>
<P>
   Cary Hammer, a Web and video game developer, and his wife,
Nadine Browning, plan to celebrate the coming of 2000 with a party
_ as do a few billion other people. But their party, at their home
in San Francisco, will center on the burial of a time capsule in
the backyard, and to that end, Hammer has bought a $55,
18-by-4-inch polymer tube from Future Archaeology of Manhattan.
</P>
<P>
   Hammer is asking guests to bring items for interment until 3000.
``I like the idea of it, the pseudo-immortality of it,'' he said of
time capsules. ``I want to walk around my house with a video camera
and talk about everything in it, what our jobs are like, and put
that tape in the capsule.'' He also plans to put in one of the
games he developed. ``It would be nice if something I created was
around 1,000 years from now,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   He said of one invited guest: ``This friend thinks that so many
copies exist of everything digital, it's so pervasive, that it
doesn't need a time capsule to be preserved. There is even a
company archiving the entire content of the Web every week. He
prefers to put in more mundane, random items, such as an apple
peeler.''

LIFE IN LIBERATOR VILLAGE UNITED BOMBER-PLANT WORKERS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By ART CHAPMAN 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WHITE SETTLEMENT, Texas _ The aircraft from Lockheed Martin
ascend abruptly now, but in 1943, lumbering B-24 Liberators
struggled low over the rooftops of Fort Worth.
</P>
<P>
   The strain of the engines was a common sound to the thousands of
people who lived directly below. They were the people who built the
planes, the people of Liberator Village, a community of 6,000
housed in 1,500 government-built apartments named for the famed
World War II bomber.
</P>
<P>
   Liberator Village was never an official township, never
incorporated, never a part of Fort Worth. It was simply a
collection of working families bound by the common causes of making
a living and supporting the war effort.
</P>
<P>
   The village was governed by a ``community council,'' and there
was an energetic spirit of patriotism. It was nearly idyllic for
the older residents who had suffered through Depression years _ a
job and a home, closely connected. For the children, it was bliss:
an endless supply of playmates on a giant neighborhood playground
that seemingly never closed.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was 12 when we moved here and my parents went to work at the
defense plant,'' said Rex Scott, a former mayor of White
Settlement. ``It was like a large extended family. We all had
almost the same things in common, and that was to make things as
good for people in the military service as possible. ... No one was
rich, no one was real poor. We were all the same, blue-collar sort
of families.''
</P>
<P>
   Liberator Village is nearly gone now. There is one remaining
building, tucked inconspicuously off Cherry Lane at Wyatt. The
white tile structure was once a residence for several families; now
it houses the offices of a suburban newspaper.
</P>
<P>
   ``There might have been 100 people living around here prior to
the Village, a few farmhouses,'' Scott said. ``White Settlement
would never have developed the way it did without Liberator
Village. It increased the growth of White Settlement and of Fort
Worth dramatically.''
</P>
<P>
   The intersection of Cherry Lane and White Settlement Road was
the epicenter of Liberator Village when it opened in February 1943.
The Village was hailed as a great improvement for workers at
Consolidated Aircraft Corp., better known as ``the bomber plant.''
</P>
<P>
   The plant opened in April 1942. It was an enormous magnet for
workers who had struggled through pre-war hard times and were now
encouraged with Consolidated's comparatively lucrative pay scale.
</P>
<P>
   The work force was abundant, but not the housing. As the
government helped finance the building of the plant, it financed
the living accommodations as well.
</P>
<P>
   ``There were three sections, 500 units each,'' said Jim Weaver,
who moved to Liberator Village in 1944. ``The first section was
built with white asbestos siding and pier-and-beam foundations. The
second section was the same only on slab foundations. They were
called `The Whites.' The third addition was built with red tiles
and called `The Bricks.'''
</P>
<P>
   They were four-plexes, small, but not unusually tiny for the
times. Rent was $34 for a one-bedroom, $38 for two bedrooms, $42
for three bedrooms.
</P>
<P>
   ``We moved to Liberator Village from Itasca,'' Weaver said.
``Dad was working for the cotton mills for 35 cents an hour. He
came to Consolidated and doubled his pay to 70 cents an hour. Our
apartment at the Village was the first indoor plumbing I had ever
seen.''
</P>
<P>
   Many of the families moving to the Village were like the
Weavers. West Texans, hungry for jobs, came to the Village in large
numbers. Some already worked at the bomber plant but were driving
several miles in the darkness of early morning and late night. Time
away from their families.
</P>
<P>
   The ``town hall'' of the Village was actually the recreation
center, a long, gray, 1-story building that housed nearly all the
clubs and associations within the complex. It was there that church
services were held, as well as ping-pong matches and airplane club
meetings, home nursing classes, sewing classes, dance classes and
Bible studies.
</P>
<P>
   Life revolved around work at the bomber plant. While one shift
was working, the other two were sleeping or at play.
</P>
<P>
   There were few problems, at least during the war years. In 1948,
the Snack Shack burned to the ground when the Liberator Village
Fire Department refused to answer the call. It turned out the Fire
Department could not legally respond to any call ``not involving or
threatening the $4 million government housing facility.'' The Snack
Shack was privately owned and just off government property.
</P>
<P>
   The flood of 1949 lapped at the streets of Liberator Village but
didn't damage the community. A nearby trailer park, however, was
destroyed.
</P>
<P>
   In 1950, federal authorities decided that they would begin
selling off the Village. The ``Whites,'' the frame structures, were
demolished, and the 500 tile buildings were the only ones left. In
1956, a developer bought the land to build brick homes. Those homes
remain, but recollections of the village are nearly exhausted.
</P>
<P>
   By 1963, Liberator Village was completely gone, save the one
remaining building.
</P>
<P>
   Consolidated became Convair, then General Dynamics and
eventually Lockheed. The B-24 Liberator gave way to the B-36, the
F-111 and the F-16. With each transition, the community was
altered. Transportation improved; people moved away.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are a lot of fond memories surrounding Liberator
Village,'' Scott said. ``You couldn't do anything like that today.
Everybody knows so much more about one another now. They don't take
people at face value anymore. Times have changed.''

   There have been attempts throughout time capsule history to
think through the problem of the unintelligible message, like one
included on a medium that requires an obsolete device to ``read''
it (a book displays itself, but a CD-ROM must be ``opened'' with a
separate device).
</P>
<P>
   The International Time Capsule Society maintains the Crypt of
Civilization, a swimming-pool-size vault sealed in 1940 that has
been described as ``a kind of Noah's Ark of Depression-era
knowledge and technology''; it will not be opened until 8113. That
year was chosen because the people who created the crypt decided
that 1940 was the midpoint between the start of time and 8113,
although now it is not at all clear whether their calculations hold
up.
</P>
<P>
   The crypt includes, among many other things, 640,000 pages of
microfilmed material and, crucially, a film reader with a
wind-powered generator. The crypt's planners left little to chance:
the first item encountered upon entering the crypt is a device
designed to teach English to its finders.
</P>
<P>
   Similarly, the Voyager spacecraft contained a kind of time
capsule intended for extraterrestrials: a 12-inch gold-plated
phonograph record carrying sounds and images selected to portray
the diversity of life and culture on Earth. Each record is encased
in a protective aluminum jacket along with a cartridge and a
needle. Instructions, in symbolic language, indicate how the record
is to be played.
</P>
<P>
   The New York Times is making plans for a Times Capsule to
complement a 1999 series of six special Times Magazine issues
inspired by the millennium change. Jack Rosenthal, editor in chief
of the Times Magazine, said the paper was considering a method of
including data in its capsule (to be deposited for 1,000 years at a
still undecided spot in Manhattan) that uses a new technology known
as HD-Rosetta. It can etch data microscopically, using a
charged-particle beam, on a nickel disk that can be read with a
microscope. More than 90,000 8-by-11-inch text pages can be stored
on one 2-inch disk.
</P>
<P>
   Children's University, a private elementary school in Arlington,
Texas, is planning a time capsule to include a school scrapbook and
items selected by the children. Lynn Kenner, the school's director,
said that when it came to messages, the students insisted that
their words be put on computer diskettes. ``We suggested paper, but
the kids wanted the space to really say a lot,'' she said, ``and
they also appear to feel that computers are the way to communicate
with the future.'' The school's capsule will be buried for just 12
years.
</P>
<P>
   Short-term capsules do appear to be growing in popularity. Chris
Chance, managing director of Future Archaeology
(www.futurearchaeology.com), a capsule manufacturer that has sold
nearly 4,000 capsules this year _ up fourfold from last year _ said
many of his customers were planning to open their capsules in a
mere 10 to 25 years.
</P>
<P>
   Benford did not approve. ``Where is the sense of awe in that?''
he said. ``You might as well just send it to yourself through the
mail.''
</P>
<P>
   Jeff McCarty argues that burial is passe. He is founder and
president of Original Time Capsule Co., in Greenfield, Ind., which
plans to sell $20 ``personal capsules'' in card stores. It offers
capsule kits to commemorate personal events like graduations and
births.
</P>
<P>
   ``People can't relate to anything longer than a human
lifetime,'' McCarty said. ``The trend is that people want to open
up their own capsules. That's what I'm planning for a capsule I
created last year for my wedding. I'm going to open it in 10
years.'' He included a cellular phone in his capsule because ``it's
something I use a lot.''
</P>
<P>
   The new preference for shallow time capsules may in itself
reflect our technological obsessions, said Alexander Rose,
executive director of the Long Now Foundation (www.longnow.org), a
group in San Francisco that among other things is trying to spur
opinion-makers to embrace longer-term perspectives by building a
10,000-year clock. ``Short-term capsules are a reaction to
technology,'' Rose said. ``They're saying you can't look beyond 5
to 30 years because that's our technological cycle, the life cycle
of our devices.''
</P>
<P>
   Shallow time capsules do sidestep a basic conundrum: It has been
estimated that for every thousand or so capsules that are buried,
only one is found. The International Time Capsule Society even
maintains a list of Most Wanted capsules, prominent examples that
have not been found.
</P>
<P>
   McCarty said there might be a happy medium between the shallow
and the deep that also solved the problem of technological
obsolescence: ``perpetual'' capsules that are opened at regular
intervals. He is involved in an effort to create what he calls
``the first fully electronic capsule'' as part of the Times Square
2000 event. It will include messages from high school students
throughout the nation and other information using digital
videodisks.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're considering a plan to open it every 25 years and migrate
the information inside to new technology,'' he said. ``Think about
it: we all put our 8-millimeter home movies on VHS, and it was no
big deal.''
</P>
<P>
   To think in short windows, some people say, undercuts the value
of time capsules. Messages left unintentionally, like the remains
of Pompeii, tend to have far more import than those handpicked by
people, Benford said.
</P>
<P>
   ``One of the truths about capsules,'' added Ms. O'Connell, the
documentary filmmaker, ``is that they are as much for the here and
now as they are for the future.''

<TEXT>
<P>
   The International Time Capsule Society offers these tips on
organizing a time capsule:
</P>
<P>
   _ Pick a retrieval date. If it's no more than 50 years later,
the capsule may be opened by your own generation or your
children's.
</P>
<P>
   _ Choose an archivist or director. Committees are good to share
the workload, but a single person needs to direct the project.
</P>
<P>
   _ Pick a container. A safe is a good choice; other possibilities
include getting a time capsule from companies that sell containers
made for this purpose. The interior must be cool, dry and dark.
</P>
<P>
   _ Find a secure location. Thousands of buried capsules have been
lost, so burial is not recommended. It is important to mark the
location with a plaque describing the capsule.
</P>
<P>
   _ Choose capsule items thoughtfully. Many items will have
meaning into the future. Many committees try to pick items that
include the sublime and the trivial. The archivist should keep an
inventory of all capsule items.
</P>
<P>
   _ Have a formal sealing ceremony and give the capsule a name.
Keep a good photographic record of the event, including the inside
of the completed project.
</P>
<P>
   _ Don't forget about the capsule. Try to renew the tradition of
memory with anniversaries and reunions. Send out invitations to the
projected opening.
</P>
<P>
   _ Tell the International Time Capsule Society about your
capsule. The society keeps a database in an effort to register all
known capsules.

   A few of the most-wanted time capsules from the records of the
International Time Capsule Society:
</P>
<P>
   _ Bicentennial Wagon Train Time Capsule: This capsule was
supposed to hold the signatures of 22 million Americans. But on
July 4, 1976, when President Gerald R. Ford arrived for the sealing
ceremony in Valley Forge, Pa., someone had stolen the empty
capsule, officials at Valley Forge National Park said.
</P>
<P>
   _ MIT Cyclotron Time Capsule: In 1939, some MIT engineers put a
brass capsule beneath an 18-ton magnet used in a new cyclotron that
was put in a concrete cubicle to trap radiation, said Ulrich
Becker, a physics professor at MIT who researched the matter
because he wanted to remove the cyclotron. The capsule was
forgotten for a time, but now there is a bigger problem: how to
remove it from under a 36,000-pound lid in a concrete sarcophagus.
</P>
<P>
   _ M.A.S.H Time Capsule: Containing props and costumes, the
capsule was buried by cast members of the TV show in a ceremony in
January 1983, according to 20th Century Fox officials. The site was
said to be somewhere in the 20th Century Fox parking lot in
Hollywood.
</P>
<P>
   _ The 1851 U.S. Capitol Extension Cornerstone. A jar containing
$40.44 in coins, historical parchments, newspapers, views of
Washington and other items was placed in a cornerstone below ground
at the Capitol extension in 1851, said William C. Allen, the
architectural historian in the office of the architect of the
Capitol. It cannot be seen but is still there, and was apparently
intended as a permanent memento. In contrast, from 1876 to 1878,
for the nation's centennial, a safe containing photographs and
autographs of government officials and other items was sealed with
the instruction that it be opened at the bicentennial in 1976,
which it was.
</P>
<P>
   _ The Gramophone Time Capsule: Sound recordings were deposited
behind the foundation stone of the new Gramophone Co. factory in
Hayes, England, by opera singer Nellie Melba, according to the
International Time Capsule Society. During construction at the
company (later HMV, later still EMI), the container was officially
removed, but vanished before it could be reburied.

WHERE RUBBER MEETS THE ROAD, A CHIP 
</HEADLINE>
   (af)  
 By LISA GUERNSEY   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Someday your tires might be full of more than hot air. They may
have minds of their own, keeping track of their air pressure and
letting you know when they need to be replaced.
</P>
<P>
   That day, in fact, may have already arrived if you happen to be
driving a fully loaded Lincoln Continental. And if you haul freight
in an 18-wheeler or fly commercial planes, you may be communicating
with your tires as soon as a year from now.
</P>
<P>
   Smartire Systems, based in Vancouver, British Columbia, already
has a relatively smart system on the market. It consists of a
battery-powered device about the size of a cigarette lighter that
is strapped to each wheel before tires are installed. It also
includes a handheld module, with a display screen, that receives
signals about the tires' air pressure and temperature from the
devices inside the tires.
</P>
<P>
   ``We take an otherwise dumb tire and make it smart,'' said
Robert V. Rudman, president and chief executive of Smartire.
</P>
<P>
   A built-in Smartire system is now a Lincoln Continental option,
and Smartire is now marketing the system as a stand-alone $299
product that can be installed in a car or trailer you already own.
(To see how the technology works, look at the
www.smartire.com/commerce/demo.html site.)
</P>
<P>
   The Goodyear Tire and Rubber Co. is developing what it considers
an even more intelligent tire, which it is now testing for use in
commercial trucks and aircraft. Goodyear's ``intelligent tire
technology'' is embedded within the rubber of the tires when they
are manufactured. It is expected to be on the market in the next
year.
</P>
<P>
   Goodyear's tire gets its smarts from a tiny package of
computerized instruments, including miniature pressure and
temperature sensors. These sensors are microelectromechanical
systems, or MEMS, the result of a marriage of computer circuitry
and mechanical sensors on a very small scale. MEMS have been
described by engineers as a way to detect and solve problems in a
number of things, like airplanes and skyscrapers.
</P>
<P>
   In the Goodyear tire, the MEMS technology is within a
transponder that acts like the tire's brain. The transponder is
made up of silicon wafers, circuits and sensors that together are
about the size of a quarter. The sensors pick up data about
pressure and temperature and then store that information within the
silicon chips. The transponder sends the data outside the tire
through a wireless radio signal. It does not require a battery.
</P>
<P>
   Goodyear is now developing devices that might be used by
commercial industries to read and re-transmit those signals. A
handheld or dashboard computer, for example, might be used to send
a pulse to the tire, inquiring about its status. Another
possibility is that the tire would transmit information to a
display screen or printer after being driven over some sort of pad
that would stimulate the transponder.
</P>
<P>
   In the next few years, tractor-trailers may get tire-pressure
readings while driving over scales at weigh stations off the
highway.
</P>
<P>
   ``Mostly we are looking at commercial truck and aircraft uses,''
said Tom Walker, general manager for Goodyear's aviation projects.
``We don't see it as something for car tires for the consumer _ at
least in the short term.''
</P>
<P>
   But beyond the short term _ say in 5 or 10 years _ it is likely
that consumers will be treated to some, if not all, of the benefits
of the technology, Walker said.
</P>
<P>
   For example, Goodyear is already marketing the Run-Flat tire,
and Michelin is selling a similar product called the Zero Pressure
tire. A car with such tires can continue driving for up to 50 miles
at 55 miles an hour after getting a flat.
</P>
<P>
   Right now, the tires require a device like that developed by
Smartire to monitor their pressure. The device triggers an alarm,
warning drivers that although the tire is not actually flat, it has
lost air and needs to be replaced soon. Maybe such capabilities
will someday be built into the tires themselves, rather than
relying on external devices, Walker said.
</P>
<P>
   In Goodyear's intelligent tires, the transponder also includes a
hidden chip that stamps each tire with a unique identification
number. A mechanic will be able to send a signal to the chip,
asking the tire for its number. Using that number and a handheld
computer, a mechanic or engineer could look up information about
the tire that has been stored in an external, networked database.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike bar codes or other indentifiers that might be applied to
the outside of the tires, the embedded identification chips can
withstand more rugged conditions and will not wear off over time.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can track the life of that tire,'' said Brian Logan,
Goodyear's project manager for tire technology. ``You can track
where it's been, if it's been repaired or how many times the tire
has been retreaded.''
</P>
<P>
   That information, however, comes from a person who enters the
data into a database under the corresponding identification number.
The tires are not yet smart enough, Logan said, to record and store
their own repair history.
</P>
<P>
   Goodyear is now testing its intelligent tires in commercial
trucks and buses and commercial aircraft. The company is also
working with Lockheed Martin, a defense contractor, to develop a
system that will refine the maintenance of military planes and
their landing wheels.
</P>
<P>
   Knowing when to add more air pressure to a tire could help
companies save money. Driving with over- or under-inflated tires
causes them to wear unevenly, which makes the tires more
susceptible to flats. And a vehicle that is driven with
underinflated tires burns more fuel.
</P>
<P>
   Teri Short, a manager of systems engineering for Continental
Airlines, said another benefit of the technology was that it would
allow workers to check the air pressure in airplane tires just
after the plane had landed, instead of waiting three or four hours
for the tires to cool, as is typically done now.
</P>
<P>
   When the tires are hot, the air pressure readings are distorted,
but the technology will automatically convert pressure readings to
cool-tire readings, regardless of the temperature of the tires.
``It would definitely save time,'' Ms. Short said.
</P>
<P>
   Eventually, automobile and motorcycle owners may also have a new
way to check their tires.
</P>
<P>
   Douglas Love, a spokesman for the Automobile Club of New York,
an affiliate of the American Automobile Association, said that most
drivers did not check their tires' air pressure as often as they
should because they hated having to touch tires coated with black
brake dust.
</P>
<P>
   ``Anything that gives people an alternative to getting dirty,''
Love said, ``is a good step.''

<P>
   Members of the so-called Trench Coat Mafia _ who reportedly had
a thing for Swastikas, spoke German phrases to one another and
executed their horrific mission on Adolf Hitler's birthday _ were
said to be devoted fans of the veteran German techno band KMFDM.
</P>
<P>
   That's an acronym for Kein Mehrheit Fur Die Mitleid, which can
be roughly translated into: ``No Pity for the Majority.''
</P>
<P>
   You could call Chicago the second home of this band. They
recorded the CDs ``XTORT'' and ``ANGST'' here, and at least one
band member lived here in the early 1990s. Their Chicago fans are
fiercely devoted to their infectious music and their violent,
profanity-filled lyrics.
</P>
<P>
   Teen-age gunmen Eric Harris and Dylan Klebold were also big fans
of the now-disbanded group, which released its farewell album,
``Adios,'' on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   With the help of an operator of an unofficial KMFDM website, I
was able to tap into a copy of what has been reported to be the
Internet home page of one of the gunmen. (It's no longer accessible
on America Online.) The page features KMFDM lyrics such as:
</P>
<P>
   I have come to rock your world
</P>
<P>
   I have come to shake your faith
</P>
<P>
   Anathematic Anti-Christ
</P>
<P>
   I have come to take my place
</P>
<P>
   As I type these words, I've got the headphones on and I'm
listening to other efforts from KMFDM, e.g., ``A Drug Against
War.''
</P>
<P>
   Kill everything, kill everything
</P>
<P>
   Bomb the living bejeepers out of those forces
</P>
<P>
   Kill everything, kill everything
</P>
<P>
   Bomb the living bejeepers out of those forces
</P>
<P>
   Great. It's not that hard to picture Harris and Klebold and
maybe a couple of their outcast buddies hanging out in a basement
or a garage, wearing their black dusters and applying their dark
makeup and their black fingernail polish as they nod their heads in
time with KMFDM.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe their favorite tune was ``The Problem,'' which includes
these lyrics:
</P>
<P>
   If there is a problem, it's a problem with the system
</P>
<P>
   The system of home and family, of school and community ...
</P>
<P>
   We acknowledge not all kids fill our ancillary desire
</P>
<P>
   And when they don't fit, they become the problem
</P>
<P>
   Expel the problem
</P>
<P>
   Make it go away
</P>
<P>
   Expel the problem
</P>
<P>
   Make it go away...
</P>
<P>
   If KMFDM truly was the favored band of the Trench Coat Mafia,
how much responsibility should be placed on the violence-caressing,
blood-lusting, fist-pumping music?
</P>
<P>
   Well, none, of course.
</P>
<P>
   Within hours of the shootings, the blame game was in full
effect, on TV and on the Internet, where literally thousands of
comments were posted well before the true death tally was known or
the gunmen had been identified.
</P>
<P>
   Just some of the people and things cited as negative influences,
or at least enabling factors:
</P>
<P>
   The parents of the gunmen. Marilyn Manson. ``The Matrix.'' MTV.
Bill Clinton. ``City of Angels.'' (Sure, it was a love story, but
death was the dominant theme and the angels all wore black trench
coats.) Charlton Heston and the NRA. Race relations in America. The
world wide web.
</P>
<P>
   Witchcraft.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Crow.'' The media. School officials. The music of KMFDM.
``Natural Born Killers.'' Violent video games. The ``Goth''
movement. Society.
</P>
<P>
   It's impossible _ and unfair _ to point to a band or a movie or
a TV show and say ``That was the cause,'' and then turn to a
slaughter and say, ``This is the effect.'' If that's the way it
worked, how can it be that hundreds of thousands of fans the world
over have been exposed to the heart-thumping music of KMFDM without
turning violent?
</P>
<P>
   ``The Catcher in the Rye'' didn't shoot John Lennon, and Ice-T
didn't kill any cops, and the members of KMFDM didn't storm a
school in Colorado and start shooting. Granted, there's much of pop
culture that, like cigarettes and alcohol, should not be targeted
toward young people, but human beings with good hearts and rational
minds can absorb pop culture _ even if it's subversive,
pornographic or hate-filled garbage _ without allowing it to
corrupt their value systems.
</P>

   Members of the so-called Trench Coat Mafia _ who reportedly had
a thing for Swastikas, spoke German phrases to one another and
executed their horrific mission on Adolf Hitler's birthday _ were
said to be devoted fans of the veteran German techno band KMFDM.
</P>
<P>
   That's an acronym for Kein Mehrheit Fur Die Mitleid, which can
be roughly translated into: ``No Pity for the Majority.''
</P>
<P>
   You could call Chicago the second home of this band. They
recorded the CDs ``XTORT'' and ``ANGST'' here, and at least one
band member lived here in the early 1990s. Their Chicago fans are
fiercely devoted to their infectious music and their violent,
profanity-filled lyrics.
</P>
<P>
   Teen-age gunmen Eric Harris and Dylan Klebold were also big fans
of the now-disbanded group, which released its farewell album,
``Adios,'' on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   With the help of an operator of an unofficial KMFDM website, I
was able to tap into a copy of what has been reported to be the
Internet home page of one of the gunmen. (It's no longer accessible
on America Online.) The page features KMFDM lyrics such as:
</P>
<P>
   I have come to rock your world
</P>
<P>
   I have come to shake your faith
</P>
<P>
   Anathematic Anti-Christ
</P>
<P>
   I have come to take my place
</P>
<P>
   As I type these words, I've got the headphones on and I'm
listening to other efforts from KMFDM, e.g., ``A Drug Against
War.''
</P>
<P>
   Kill everything, kill everything
</P>
<P>
   Bomb the living bejeepers out of those forces
</P>
<P>
   Kill everything, kill everything
</P>
<P>
   Bomb the living bejeepers out of those forces
</P>
<P>
   Great. It's not that hard to picture Harris and Klebold and
maybe a couple of their outcast buddies hanging out in a basement
or a garage, wearing their black dusters and applying their dark
makeup and their black fingernail polish as they nod their heads in
time with KMFDM.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe their favorite tune was ``The Problem,'' which includes
these lyrics:
</P>
<P>
   If there is a problem, it's a problem with the system
</P>
<P>
   The system of home and family, of school and community ...
</P>
<P>
   We acknowledge not all kids fill our ancillary desire
</P>
<P>
   And when they don't fit, they become the problem
</P>
<P>
   Expel the problem
</P>
<P>
   Make it go away
</P>
<P>
   Expel the problem
</P>
<P>
   Make it go away...
</P>
<P>
   If KMFDM truly was the favored band of the Trench Coat Mafia,
how much responsibility should be placed on the violence-caressing,
blood-lusting, fist-pumping music?
</P>
<P>
   Well, none, of course.
</P>
<P>
   Within hours of the shootings, the blame game was in full
effect, on TV and on the Internet, where literally thousands of
comments were posted well before the true death tally was known or
the gunmen had been identified.
</P>
<P>
   Just some of the people and things cited as negative influences,
or at least enabling factors:
</P>
<P>
   The parents of the gunmen. Marilyn Manson. ``The Matrix.'' MTV.
Bill Clinton. ``City of Angels.'' (Sure, it was a love story, but
death was the dominant theme and the angels all wore black trench
coats.) Charlton Heston and the NRA. Race relations in America. The
world wide web.
</P>
<P>
   Witchcraft.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Crow.'' The media. School officials. The music of KMFDM.
``Natural Born Killers.'' Violent video games. The ``Goth''
movement. Society.
</P>
<P>
   It's impossible _ and unfair _ to point to a band or a movie or
a TV show and say ``That was the cause,'' and then turn to a
slaughter and say, ``This is the effect.'' If that's the way it
worked, how can it be that hundreds of thousands of fans the world
over have been exposed to the heart-thumping music of KMFDM without
turning violent?
</P>
<P>
   ``The Catcher in the Rye'' didn't shoot John Lennon, and Ice-T
didn't kill any cops, and the members of KMFDM didn't storm a
school in Colorado and start shooting. Granted, there's much of pop
culture that, like cigarettes and alcohol, should not be targeted
toward young people, but human beings with good hearts and rational
minds can absorb pop culture _ even if it's subversive,
pornographic or hate-filled garbage _ without allowing it to
corrupt their value systems.
</P>
<P>
   We should investigate why these strange kids were not considered
dangerous by their community. We should find how and where they got
the guns. We should continue to study ways to make schools safer.
</P>
<P>
   And we should accept two realities: There is no answer to the
question of ``Why?'', and the blame for the shooting rests squarely
within the rotting souls of the killers.

DR. SPOCK YIELDS TO THE WORLD WIDE WEB 
</HEADLINE>
  (Eds: 2nd take is a list of websites, with reviews.) 
(js) 
 By ERIC NAGOURNEY   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   What's a new parent to do? Dr. Benjamin Spock has been knocked
off his pedestal by pans of his real-life fathering. Dr. T. Berry
Brazelton, as dear to many parents' hearts as was Spock, is locked
in battle with his fellow best-selling child-raising author, John
Rosemond, over toilet training, of all things. And from somewhere
in your apartment rises a wail that, with luck, might belong to a
rousing velociraptor _ but is more likely coming from the lungs of
a far fiercer creature: your baby.
</P>
<P>
   As the icons of child rearing fall by the wayside or into
professional squabbles, where can a new parent (the ``desperate''
goes without saying) still find authoritative, unimpeachable advice
on everything from bed-wetting to bedlam?
</P>
<P>
   The Web, of course. No, seriously.
</P>
<P>
   Granted, as has often been noted, digging out reliable
information from the Internet is a little iffier than hitting the
advice section of a bookstore, thumbing through hand-me-down books
or asking a relative who has actually done this before. There is,
after all, some fairly strange stuff sitting on all those servers
out there. When your 4-month-old suddenly refuses to take her
bottle, you don't want your search engine to send you to some site
revealing that a guerrilla team of highly trained babies knocked
Flight 800 out of the sky with a barrage of diaper bombs.
</P>
<P>
   But there are a host of Web sites with sound information
intended for new parents, from those still cooing at fuzzy-gazed
newborns to those who spend the day coaxing toddlers off the
bookshelves. Of course, how a new parent would find the time to
spend on the Internet is a little hard to figure.
</P>
<P>
   Most sites offer a range of advice on topics like baby names,
feeding, child-development milestones and sleep habits. As far as
this goes, they don't offer much advantage over a book. But Web
sites, with their ability to be quickly updated, allow parents to
keep abreast of breaking news on the baby front, including new
health studies, the latest thinking on various child-rearing issues
and product warnings about child accessories like cribs and car
seats.
</P>
<P>
   And of course, the sites allow new parents (and veterans) to
exchange tips _ or just gripe _ on bulletin boards and in chat
rooms. Some sites also allow you to customize their home pages to
your needs, if you are willing to part with a fair amount of
personal information.
</P>
<P>
   All that can be fairly reassuring stuff to a new parent
struggling to get his or her bearings. The slew of ads peppering
the more successful Web sites also offer their own peculiar form of
reassurance. On those days when you feel convinced that no parent
could be less competent than you, hop online and take heart: you
are no loser. On the contrary, you are suddenly very popular. You
have just gone from being a consumer to a superconsumer (not to
mention being the owner-operator of someone who soon will be
fueling the economy with his own purchases), and a lot of big
companies want you to know just how much they care.
</P>
<P>
   All of which suggests that new parents searching for help online
should exercise caution. The baby-advice sites offer especially
good examples of the challenge of evaluating information on the
Web. In this case, on the well-established sites, it is often not
so much a question of assessing the trustworthiness of the
information as trying to figure out if you are reading an objective
piece of advice or a skillfully devised ad. Sometimes it is hard
even to figure out who is running a site.
</P>
<P>
   That said, with a little common sense, most parents will be able
to find something of value on the Web. They can even find
information from some child-raising authors who first made their
name in books.
</P>
<P>
   Spock, who died last year, did some writing for the Web site
Parenttime.com, and material from him can still be found there (if
only he had thought to prepare a defense of his personal life,
criticized in a biography that appeared after his death). Brazelton
appears, among other places, on Babycenter.com, where (sponsored by
a popular disposable diaper) he espouses his view that parents
should not rush to toilet-train their children. Rosemond, a
conservative who argues for early training (and criticizes
Brazelton for accepting diaper-industry money), has his own site
(www.rosemond.com).
</P>
<P>
   Still, with all the sites out there, none reviewed here seemed
able to answer a basic question: Why do parents need a Web site to
figure out babies, when babies seem to figure out their parents
just fine on their own?  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   (More)
</P>
<P>
   Babycenter
</P>
<P>
   www.babycenter.com
</P>
<P>
   Babycenter is one of the heavyweight sites in the new-parent
market. A quick look makes it clear that the site has attracted
significant sponsorship from companies selling everything from
cotton swabs to life insurance. Indeed, at first glance it was hard
to tell whether the Web site was just a catalog for baby products
or a genuine source of general information for parents.
</P>
<P>
   So it was a relief to see a link to a page for expectant parents
asking, ``What gear do you really need?'' Here, the implication
seemed to be, was advice that would allow a neophyte,
budget-conscious parent to cut through the hype and buy only what
was really needed.
</P>
<P>
   Think again. ``It's a sure bet,'' the page said, ``that if you
have a baby in your life, you're going to need a lot of stuff in
your life.'' And guess who was prepared to sell a lot of it to you?
</P>
<P>
   Babycenter has another annoying practice, providing what it
likes to describe as reviews of child-raising books _ and then
offering those very same books for sale on the site. You assume
they will not pan their own merchandise.
</P>
<P>
   Elsewhere on the site, a ``teaser'' suggested you could ``bond
with your baby'' through massage. No quarrel here: It has long been
known that massage is a good way to calm an infant. But the advice
was sponsored by Johnson's Baby products, and in addition to
offering ostensibly enlightening suggestions on massage technique
(``Talk to your baby as you touch her, make soothing sounds, tell
her how much you love her''), it reminded parents _ surprise _ to
pour baby oil on their hands before beginning. Hmmmm.
</P>
<P>
   If you can get past the commercialization of Babycenter, there
is a lot of good advice provided by a panel of child-care experts.
You can learn, for example, how to help your baby make the move
from crib to bed. For people getting ready to take vacations, there
is a substantial section on how to travel with children, including
how to babyproof a hotel room.
</P>
<P>
   You can also customize the site as to age and find out whether
your child seems to be hitting all the milestones on time. And for
those who (mysteriously) have time on their hands, there are chat
rooms, bulletin boards, sections devoted to fathers and, lately,
even a journal in which ``Mary,'' a woman described as a Los
Angeles advertising executive, has been writing about her
pregnancy. In one recent entry, she apologizes to the baby for
having been unable to prepare the nursery yet. ``So I hope you like
the living room,'' she writes. ``I promise you'll be just as loved
sleeping there as you would be surrounded by hand-painted
bunnies.''
</P>
<P>
   Of course, if ``Mary'' needs to buy some things ready-made, we
know where she can find them. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Zero To Three
</P>
<P>
   www.zerotothree.org
</P>
<P>
   The site run by Zero to Three, a not-for-profit group, offers a
solid, no-nonsense diet of information. Compared with Babycenter,
the difference is like that between a breakfast of Sugar Toasties
and Mega-Bran Flakes. One might seem tastier at first, but the
other will sustain you through the tough day ahead.
</P>
<P>
   Zero to Three is the work of a Washington research and training
organization of the same name specializing in early childhood
development. It has two sections: one for parents, the other for
professionals.
</P>
<P>
   ``Parents are the real experts,'' the opening page of the
parents' section says. ``You know your child better than anyone.
You're also your child's first _ and most important _ teacher.''
</P>
<P>
   Zero to Three is filled with useful, thought-provoking tips
about everything from day-to-day issues _ like how to hire good
child-care help _ to recognizing and handling developmental
disorders.
</P>
<P>
   The site stresses techniques parents can use to help their
children develop. ``Support your child in his attempts to master
new skills,'' advises one recent article. ``It's great that he is
motivated to try new things on his own. Doing something for him
that he can and wants to do himself can take away his initiative.''
The article suggests encouraging a child to try new things, like
taking off his own shirt, even if he fails at first. ``Just be sure
your expectations are age-appropriate,'' it says.
</P>
<P>
   Lately, the site has been running a series of article on how to
help children develop speaking skills.
</P>
<P>
   Like the commercial sites, Zero to Three has chat rooms (for now
only for professionals, although one for parents may be added) _
and a section on massage. But the site also has a resource list on
subjects that include breast-feeding, disabilities, immunizations
and poverty.
</P>
<P>
   Zero to Three staff members say the site has plans for new
sections on brain development, with information on the timing of
milestones, and on play, with suggestions on how parents can
encourage their children to learn.
</P>
<P>
   Parent Soup
</P>
<P>
   www.parentsoup.com
</P>
<P>
   One of the most popular parent sites on the Web, Parent Soup
offers an imaginative mix of ideas and activities. But despite the
staff members' chipper personal descriptions of themselves, meant
to give the site a homey feel, it is a highly commercial
enterprise. That is hardly surprising, given that it is run by
iVillage.com, the No. 1 online network of sites designed for women.
</P>
<P>
   Parent Soup is attractive and very well designed. For newcomers,
there is a useful tour of what is being offered. Everything is
polished, the writing is perky. So what if the overall tone often
smacks of insincerity, as if it had been produced by a roomful of
copy writers?
</P>
<P>
   For example, in describing the site's various ``communities'' _
sections tailored to the needs of parents of babies, toddlers,
school-age children and so on _ the tour notes that each one has a
``leader.''
</P>
<P>
   ``If you hang around in the chat areas or discussion groups,''
it says, ``you'll probably get to know these special folks. And if
you do, tell 'em to try eating a doughnut for a change and
breathing some fresh air _ we lose more talented producers to
starvation and oxygen deprivation.''
</P>
<P>
   Visitors to the site are greeted with a series of links to other
parts of Parent Soup and a Today in the Soup feature that can
include everything from timely articles _ as in Babycenter, there
was one on traveling with children _ to breaking news of interest
to parents. It can sometimes make for an odd mix. Recently, the
``hot topic'' was ``Crisis in Kosovo,'' and under it a link to an
iVillage site of family horoscopes. The Kosovo feature was not a
bad idea: Children upset by images of refugees, the site suggested,
should be given concrete ways to help, like fund drives. There were
links and phone numbers for a variety of aid groups.
</P>
<P>
   Like most of the other sites, Parentsoup.com has experts ready
to provide a range of advice on medical issues, problems (like
bed-wetting) and discipline. It all seemed useful enough, if
similar to what is on the other sites (not to mention in the
popular child-raising books).
</P>
<P>
   Parenttime
</P>
<P>
   www.parenttime.com
</P>
<P>
   Another big player in the competition for the hearts, minds and
pocketbooks of parents, Parenttime touches many of the same bases
as Parent Soup but is far less cutesy.
</P>
<P>
   It provides the kind of child-raising information that one can
expect to find on all the big sites for parents, but it also
ventures into other terrain. A recent article, for example, took an
intelligent look at the problems some women face when they
breast-feed in public. (``Sorry, but I don't let people have sex in
here, either,'' was one notably appalling comment reported in the
article.)
</P>
<P>
   There is even advice just for parents, including from Dr. Ruth
Westheimer, a regular contributor, who suggests a way to restore
``intimacy'' to a marriage (as if there could be anything more
intimate than changing a diaper together). Hint: It involves
setting your alarm clock to ring an hour before your baby usually
gets up. (Next week: tips for handling sleep deprivation.)
</P>
<P>
   If Parenttime reads a bit like a magazine, that should not be
surprising. It shares editors with Parenting and Baby Talk
magazines and includes material from those publications. The site
is designed for parents of children up to age 6, and its home page
is tailored for the age of the child. The toddler page, for
example, recently had a helpful article on ``Surviving the `No'
Stage'' and one on raising vegetarian children.
</P>
<P>
   The home page is updated every day, and parents can seek
information and advice from chat rooms, bulletin boards and
resident experts.
</P>
<P>
   Many parents may find much of interest on the site. Some may
even want to set the alarm clock an hour earlier, crawl over to the
computer and start reading. On second thought, maybe they should
get back into bed, rejoin their spouses _ and get some much needed
sleep.

WHERE BETTER TO FIND OUT ABOUT SPIDERS THAN ON THE WEB? 
</HEADLINE>
   (af)  
 By MICHAEL POLLAK   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Spiders belong on the Web, and not just to make a bad pun. They
are interesting, colorful and far more useful than harmful to
humans. Unfortunately, Internet menus are cluttered with listings
for ``Web spiders,'' a term for wide-ranging search programs.
</P>
<P>
   In the past year, the American Museum of Natural History in New
York has greatly expanded its online offerings, especially in
conjunction with its new Hall of Biodiversity. In cooperation with
Discovery Channel Online, the museum has created a spider page that
focuses on a recent expedition to Western Australia
(www.discovery.com/exp/spiders/spiders.html).
</P>
<P>
   In Spider Fact of the Day, one can find tidbits like E.B.
White's inspiration for his immortal Charlotte _ Araneus cavaticus,
the orb-weaving barn spider. The site mentions an estimate by
William Bristowe, a British arachnologist, that the total weight of
insects devoured each year by British spiders is greater than the
weight of all British subjects. (The site does not say whether
British cooking reduces the human biomass.)
</P>
<P>
   ``In Your Own Backyard'' describes and illustrates spider
families. ``Name That Spider'' prints some of the 4,000 contest
letters children wrote about spiders. The winner, Jeremy Falling of
Manchester, N.H., is having a spider named after him.
</P>
<P>
   ``Up Close'' lets viewers identify magnified spider parts. There
are comments on what the world would be like without spiders
(overrun with insects and disease, and devoid of most plants we
eat).
</P>
<P>
   For students wishing harder science, the museum details the
Australian mission at http://research.amnh.org/entomology/spiders.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Kefyn M. Catley, a native of Wales who helped create the
online spider pages, is a former professional flutist who changed
his career to zoology. In a recent interview at the museum, he
recalled the boyhood bug stage he never outgrew, looking under the
eaves long ago and wondering how a spider could build her web at
night, and why she did not get stuck herself.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're not a hard sell,'' Catley said of spiders. ``Everybody
on this planet has at least one story to tell.'' They do get a bad
press, he admitted. ``People have this vision about how spiders
went out to wreak havoc on mankind.''
</P>
<P>
   Actually, he said, you are 11 times more likely to be killed by
a bee or wasp, and 20 times more likely to die from lightning.
Spiders are at least 360 million years old, and are the dominant
predators on Earth, he said. ``People should think of them not just
as allies, but as absolutely necessary,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The American Tarantula Society (http://torgo.cnchost.com/ats/),
in Carlsbad, N.M., calls itself the largest arachnid society in the
world, and it offers one-stop surfing for students, teachers,
breeders, collectors and lovers of T-shirts with larger-than-life
tarantulas on them.
</P>
<P>
   The society holds an annual conference in June, and publishes an
arachnid magazine, Forum, six times a year. (Forum's letters page
is called the Eggsac.) On-line articles include ``How Bad
Information Invades Kids' Books,'' in which the author laments the
``icky spider mindset'' in children's literature.
</P>
<P>
   Through the society, one can buy Texas tan and other tarantulas.
The online shop sells books including ``The Tarantula Keeper's
Guide.'' The conditions needed to keep one species alive often will
kill another species, the experts warn.
</P>
<P>
   ``I feel that the Internet has been responsible for a flurry of
interest in tarantulas as pets,'' Doug Martin, Webmaster of the
society's page, wrote by e-mail. ``People from across the world are
able to sell, breed and trade spiders as never before. This has
resulted in a vast number of species being available to the public
as opposed to one or two when I started out in the hobby.''
</P>
<P>
   Martin's own site, Doug's Tarantula Page
(http://www.geocities.com/Petsburgh/Farm/3173) is oriented toward
the novice keeper. One link is to a bulletin board for buyers and
sellers, a kind of arachnid stock exchange.
</P>
<P>
   But before even thinking about it, Martin cautions, buy a book
on responsible pet-keeping, check with an experienced owner and
learn about state and postal regulations.

   ``NEVER BEEN KISSED''
</P>
<P>
   Starring: Drew Barrymore, David Arquette, Molly Shannon.
</P>
<P>
   Plot: Josie, a fresh-out-of-college copy editor for the Chicago
Sun Times newspaper, is sent on an assignment: to go back to high
school to find a hot, new story. Fitting in, though, is hard for
Josie, who was a complete geek in her own high school days. (And
the cool crowd is no help to her, either.) But during her second
chance, she discovers a few things about herself and life.
</P>
<P>
   Why go see it?: Drew Barrymore is surprisingly a very convincing
geek, and her character is so lovable that you are rooting for her
till the end. Warning to guys: This is a total chick flick (and a
sweet one, too), so be prepared when your girlfriends drag you to
it, twice. But, to both guys and girls, this original and
refreshing movie will make you laugh out loud through it all.
</P>
<P>
   Reason for rating: PG-13 for mature language and innuendo.
</P>
<P>
   Reviewer's 1 - 10 rating: 7.5.

ADVICE ABOUT GUYS, SUICIDE 
 FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE 
 FROM THE FORT WORTH STAR-TELEGRAM
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
   DEAR TeensTalk: I'm having a hard time with this guy I like. He
claims to like me a lot, and we used to have fun hanging together.
But recently he says he doesn't have time for me. I have paged and
called him and he never calls me back. He plays football, and it is
very time-consuming. Should I move on? _ Football.
</P>
<P>
   DEAR Football: You have tried in every way to get messages to
him and let him know that you are still interested. He has not
returned the messages, so it's time for you to move on. You can try
to talk to him, but the signs are clear that he is moving on. You
deserve to have a guy who has an interest in you and time for you.
</P>
<P>
   DEAR TeensTalk: My best friend recently committed suicide. No
one ever expected it. He was very religious and always happy. He
had a girlfriend and their relationship was going great. One
morning, his parents found him _ he hanged himself. Everyone was
confused as to why he did it. His parents are torn up and the kids
at school don't understand.
</P>
<P>
   The school has called in counselors, and they are talking to
students. I just can't seem to stop thinking about him. I really
wish he had talked to me or someone else about his problems, or
left a note. I feel hollow. I don't want to go to his funeral. I
really don't know what to say to his family. Help.
</P>
<P>
   DEAR Help: There are not always going to be signs that someone
close to you is upset or thinking of suicide. Like your friend,
some people decide that their problems are too large to handle and
their only solution is suicide.
</P>
<P>
   They often give no warning. There are no direct signs that
indicate that a person is contemplating suicide. Indirect signs may
be hopelessness, talking about death, no planning for the future,
not eating, not sleeping, inability to complete daily functions and
tasks, and no interest in family and friends.
</P>
<P>
   It sounds like your friend left no clues to his depression. You
are feeling left out of his thoughts and want answers to his
depression. You are hurt and upset that your friend did not write a
note or talk to you. Your friend chose not to disclose his
depression. You cannot feel guilty; you need to grieve your friend
and accept his choice. You should try to attend the funeral and
talk to his family to share your grief and to get closure to his
death.
</P>
<P>
   You need to talk to a counselor. Later, you can talk to your
friend's parents. Presently, though, you need to work on your
feelings. Your grief is a natural process. You could attend group
counseling _ a group of people who share the same grief. Cherish
the times and memories you had with your friend.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &UR; -0- &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Do you have a problem or concern that needs an answer? The Class
Acts Teenstalk panel _ headed by Kathy Pope, a counselor at a Texas
junior college _ is comprised of teenage students who care about
other students. Write to: Teenstalk, c/o Class Acts, The New York
Times Syndicate, 122 E. 42nd St., New York, N.Y. 10168. &QL;

   HONEY, I SHRANK THE SKATEBOARD!
</P>
<P>
   Ya don't have to be an awesome skater to perform a 360 with one
of these boards.
</P>
<P>
   Developed by a 12-year-old California youth, Tech Deck
fingerboards rock like real skateboards. They contain grip tape,
metal axles, adjustable trucks, removable axle nuts, replaceable
wheels and tiny skate tools.
</P>
<P>
   But the coolest part about them is the graphics. They come in
rowdy color schemes, licensed by the top makers of full-size
boards.
</P>
<P>
   No wonder the company expects to sell 12 million of them in
1999. Priced at under $9 each, they slip right into the pocket,
too.
</P>
<P>
   Tech Deck fingerboards are hot sellers at Gadzooks, Fast
Forward, Miller's Outpost and other retailers.
</P>
<P>
   A FASHION MYSTERY REVEALED
</P>
<P>
   FUBU stands for ``For us, by us!''
</P>
<P>
   ``Customers see our pictures and can relate, whereas they
couldn't relate to some 45-year-old man living in Italy,'' said
FUBU co-founder Daymond John. ``We are just like them. We are the
consumer.''
</P>
<P>
   FUBU and its designers are being recognized for their fashion
success by ``Essence'' magazine. The company's founders are Daymond
John, Carl Brown, Keith Perrin and J. Alexander Martin, all guys
from Queens, N.Y., reports the New York Times.
</P>
<P>
   They will receive their awards on April 30. The ceremony will be
taped and televised by the Fox network in mid-June.
</P>
<P>

   The latest backpack resembles something the letter carrier might
wear. Yes, the ``messenger'' bag wins the title for the coolest
carry-all on the fashionable east and west coasts. With a sturdy,
wide strap, the unisex bag is designed to wear over one shoulder
and across the chest. Look for canvas, leather and plastic styles
by Gap, Dickies, Old Navy and other manufacturers ($16 and up).
</P>
<P>
   BOXERS 2000

   Earth Day is officially celebrated on April 22, this Thursday.
But that doesn't mean students limit themselves protecting the
Earth to just one day.
</P>
<P>
   Conserving the environment is an ongoing project that requires
effort and action. At one elementary school, prekindergarten
students are learning that taking care of the Earth means taking
care of their own rooms, homes, playgrounds and schools. Tomorrow,
the 4-year-olds will join fourth-graders in planting begonia
flowers outside the campus.
</P>
<P>
   ``If everybody does a little bit, then it makes a big
difference. If people didn't care about the Earth now, 30 years
from now we'll have trash everywhere,'' said teacher Kristin Hood.
``It just helps the students become aware of their surroundings.
They will want to take care of their surroundings if they're taught
early enough. It's an important concept.''
</P>
<P>
   Here are some ways students are working to help the environment.
</P>
<P>
   The Earth Alert group at one junior high has been monitoring the
health of two local streams since 1992. Students inspect the water,
conduct tests and take temperature readings and report results to
the Trinity River Authority, a government agency.
</P>
<P>
   On one trip, students noticed an oil slick on the stream water.
They reported the problem, which was traced to a resident who was
later fined for harming the environment, group co-sponsor Cynthia
Gladden said.
</P>
<P>
   At another elementary school, students are glad that trees on
the campus lawn will be planted again this spring, said
fifth-grader Miranda Langlet. Last summer, five trees that students
planted were pulled up by vandals. The trees died in the heat.
</P>
<P>
   For five years, school organizations raised money for
landscaping the school's front and to provide badly needed shade in
back. After the vandalism, local companies offered to replace the
trees.
</P>
<P>
   One school's third-graders are using _ and preserving _ their
16-acre campus for ecological activities. They've planted a garden,
trees, and built wood boxes to attract birds (30 species live on
campus). Kids even hopped into a canoe to collect trash out of a
pond, says admissions director Martha Vandeveerdonk.
</P>
<P>
   A group of sixth-graders will be weeding flower beds, replacing
blooms and scrubbing outdoor walls and picnic tables to remove
graffiti in an effort to help students take pride in their campus,
said science teacher Penny Suazo.
</P>
<P>

   GOING NATIVE
</P>
<P>
   The Disney Channel folks are getting into the spirit of Earth
Day with a marathon of its animal adventure series, ``Going Wild
With Jeff Corwin.'' Focusing on conservation, preservation and
endangered species, the marathon will take viewers to Costa Rica,
Florida and Washington state to explore rain forests, and unusual
and/or endangered creatures such as manatees and bald eagles.
</P>
<P>
   The marathon will be from 6:00 to 8:00 p.m. on Thursday, April
22, on the Disney Channel.
</P>
<P>
   Jeff Corwin's Top 10 Ways to Celebrate Earth Day:
</P>
<P>
   1. Go natural. Skip hair spray and other aerosol products for
the day.
</P>
<P>
   2. Take a hike. Walk or ride your bike to work or school or
car-pool with others.
</P>
<P>
   3. Donate newspapers, books and magazines to libraries and
schools if you are done reading them.
</P>
<P>
   4. Bring a tote bag to the market instead of using paper or
plastic.
</P>
<P>
   5. Find a cause you believe in and donate your time to a charity
or nonprofit organization that supports that cause.
</P>
<P>
   6. Send a letter to your state senator or U.S. congressman in
support of proposals or laws that protect endangered species or
natural habitats.
</P>
<P>
   7. Only wash clothes that are dirty. Wear something more than
once before washing.
</P>
<P>
   8. Turn off the water while you brush your teeth.
</P>
<P>
   9. Turn off the lights one hour early tonight. Get in the
practice of turning lights off when you leave a room.
</P>
<P>
   10. Use the three R's: Reduce, reuse, recycle.
</P>

STAR STRUCK? CHECK OUT YOUR WEEK 
 FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE 
 FROM THE FORT WORTH STAR-TELEGRAM
</HEADLINE>

 By Students SARABETH BALON and NICK FOREMAN

<P>
   Before finalizing your activities, take time to read the
following horoscope, which is a fun way to plan your week.
</P>
<P>
   TAURUS (April 20 - May 20): Spring is your prosperous time of
the year. Not only is it when your birthday falls, but it is time
to celebrate life. Well, live it up! Go out and do something
daring. This is your time to throw off the oppression of the rest
of the year.
</P>
<P>
   GEMINI (May 21 - June 20): Start thinking of ways to make money
this summer. If you begin your business ventures now, you will be
ahead of your competition. During the course of the week, play by
the rules. Your parents are keeping a watchful eye on you and will
be quick to make the punishment fit the crime.
</P>
<P>
   CANCER (June 21 - July 22): You will be surprised this week when
you least expect it. The events that will happen during the week
will overwhelm you with happiness. Let your joy shine through you.
When you see someone who appears to be down in the dumps about
something, cheer that person up.
</P>
<P>
   LEO (July 23 - Aug. 22): If you really want something from your
parents, you have to play your cards right. Take the initiative to
do a chore or two around the house. Come home before you have to.
Work really hard to do well on your homework. After all this is
done, then ask away.
</P>
<P>
   VIRGO (Aug. 23 - Sept. 22): Give things a chance. All too often,
you trust your initial instincts. Be wary of doing this, because it
may cause you to miss out on the experience of a lifetime. This
week, make it your challenge to try something you are not too sure
about or to befriend someone you initially would not have.
</P>
<P>
   LIBRA (Sept. 23 - Oct. 22): Do not be surprised if something
great falls at your feet. You have faced a lot of disappointment
lately and are long overdue for something to be handed to you. You
and your hottie will gain a new respect for each other. It is the
little things that make a relationship work, so be open to any
ideas that he or she brings up.
</P>
<P>
   SCORPIO (Oct. 23 - Nov. 21): The word ``bad'' will not even be
in your vocab this week. Nothing but the best will rain on yonot
see how great some of these gifts are until you get some time to
really enjoy what you have received. Hold your head up so you can
see exactly where you are going. You might need to follow this path
later on down the road.
</P>
<P>
   SAGITTARIUS (Nov. 22 - Dec. 21): You mean more to your friends
and family than you can ever imagine. You are the responsible one,
the fun one, and the one everybody trusts. Hardly anyone else can
hold all three of those labels and still have enough sanity to
realize when it is too much. You need to keep yourself healthy,
because your friends feed off you.
</P>
<P>
   CAPRICORN (Dec. 22 - Jan. 19): You might find yourself
regretting a lot of missed chances this week. One big one will be
brought to your attention at school. Your friends have you on a
pedestal. You do not need to justify yourself to your friends for
your decisions, because they are yours. Regret is a feeling that
passes when something bigger and better comes along.
</P>
<P>
   AQUARIUS (Jan. 20 - Feb. 18): You need to get back into the
swing of things, because lately you have been too busy to eat,
sleep or do anything right. This week will be tough, but it will
give you some time to prepare yourself for getting back on the
right track. Live for Friday; all your troubles will seem to fall
away.
</P>
<P>
   PISCES (Feb. 19 - March 20): Expect a subtle twist in the way
that you view people this week. You will find redeeming qualities
in people whom you never had any interest in before. You are
allowing yourself to get past the outward appearance for the first
time in a long while. However, that means that some of your dearest
friends might end up in a different light, but stick with them.
</P>
<P>
   ARIES (March 21 - April 19): Every once in a while, one comes
across a week or two when everything goes right. This week will be
like that for you. When it appears that things are going sour,
something will remedy the situation. Enjoy your good fortune and
allow it to play a key role in your planning.

<P>
   WASHINGTON _ From the White House to Congress, federal officials
struggled Wednesday to express national sorrow for the mass
violence in Littleton, Colo., and to start yet another search for
ways to increase safety in schools.
</P>
<P>
   Moments of silent prayer, meditation and condolences to the
families of the victims were led in the White House by President
Clinton and on the House floor by Speaker Dennis Hastert, R-Ill.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is a deep desire to comfort the grieving and counsel
with children,''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton said.
</P>
<P>
   Hastert, a former high school teacher and wrestling coach, had a
message for the parents of students at Columbine High School: ``As
a parent of two boys, I can only imagine the grief you are feeling
today as you try to make sense of yesterday's tragic events.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton said, ``It is very important to explain to children all
over America what has happened and to reassure our own children
that they are safe (and) to hammer home to all the children of
America that violence is wrong.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton said agents from the Federal Bureau of Investigation and
the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms were already assisting
local law enforcement authorities. School and community leaders
were offered help from grief counselors and other post-crisis
consultants at a federally supported center in Denver.
</P>
<P>
   He also cleared his schedule for Thursday, in case state and
local officials request a visit by him. He might be accompanied by
officials such as Education Secretary Richard Riley and Attorney
General Janet Reno, who last August mailed a security manual to
every one of the nation's more than 100,000 public and private
schools.
</P>
<P>
   Riley said the decision not to visit Littleton on Wednesday was
reached during late-night consultations between officials of
several departments.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it's a mistake for people like me to go soaring in
while the local people are trying to sort out the tragedy,'' Riley
said.
</P>
<P>
   Responding to requests from ``many'' senators, Chairman Jim
Jeffords, R-Vt., announced that his Senate Committee on Health,
Education, Labor and Pensions would hold hearings on school
violence in May.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Edward Kennedy, D-Mass., said the ``terrible tragedy in the
heart of the nation'' might lead to new gun control and gun safety
laws.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have 14 children die every single day from gun violence''
outside schools, Kennedy said. ``But none of us here is coming up
with a silver bullet to solve all of those problems.''
</P>
<P>
   Sen. John Ashcroft, R-Mo., said Congress and society should find
a way to counter ``a culture of violence'' that includes
literature, gangsta rap and video games.
</P>
<P>
   ``These aren't things government can have much to do with,'' he
said. But he said that parents should realize that ``disrespect for
life'' can grow out of video games in which a child ``may punch out
an opponent on a machine _ kill, kill, kill _ just by punching a
button on a computer.''
</P>
<P>
   (Story can end here. Optional add follows)
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Jeff Bingaman, D-N.M., said the Littleton violence might
increase the chances of approval of his bill requiring the Justice
Department to spend $2 million setting up a new School Security
Center at Sandia National Laboratories in his home state and giving
schools $30 million over three years to buy technology recommended
by the center.
</P>
<P>
   ``For example, by installing cameras, schools could be
forewarned of problems, and law enforcement can use those cameras
in situations like the hostage situation that occurred in
Colorado,'' Bingaman said.
</P>
<P>
   By coincidence, Wednesday was the day on which the House and
Senate overwhelmingly approved a compromise version of this year's
first education bill, which Clinton has agreed to sign.
</P>
<P>
   One short clause in the Educational Flexibility bill, which
gives schools more flexibility in spending federal funds, will make
it easier for school officials to expel a student who possesses a
gun on school property.
</P>
<P>
   Previously, some students wiggled out of expulsion by arguing
that mere possession of a gun that they might have discovered
inside a school did not prove that they had violated the federal
ban on bringing a gun onto school property.

GETTING A WAKE-UP CALL ON THE ROAD
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By GRACIE BONDS STAPLES 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   FORT WORTH, Texas _ So I'm headed toward that city to the east
of here and all of a sudden God speaks to me from a black
billboard.
</P>
<P>
   ``What part of `Thou Shalt Not' didn't you understand?'' he
wants to know.
</P>
<P>
   Even at 70 miles per hour, it's the sort of to-the-point query
you grasp right away. But not believing my eyes, I slow to around
50 and turn in the direction of my heart.
</P>
<P>
   I think of the Ten Commandments: Thou shalt not bear false
witness; thou shalt not kill; thou shalt not covet anything that is
thy neighbor's. I wonder which of them I've kept, which of them I
haven't.
</P>
<P>
   Farther down the highway, closer to Dallas, God speaks to me
again: ``You think it's hot here?''
</P>
<P>
   Actually, I'm thinking I'm either dead or the end is near and
he's warning me. Just for reassurance, I ask my daughters, Jamila
and Asha, if they see the sign. Does it say something about making
rush hour longer if we use his name in vain?
</P>
<P>
   They say it does. I breathe a little easier, thinking this is
some sort of sick joke.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, I found a news story that explains my highway
experience. It seems those billboards have been springing up for a
month in more than 100 places in Dallas and Tarrant counties,
compliments of a wealthy individual who believes that Americans
have lost their moral bearings.
</P>
<P>
   The financier has insisted on anonymity. But Andy Smith, the man
behind the advertising agency that created the ``God Speaks''
signs, was quoted as saying: ``Our society these days is a mess of
murder, rape and adultery. God gave us rules, and it is his rules
we need to live by.''
</P>
<P>
   The story went on to say that response to the black-and-white
signs _ meant to get people thinking about God during the day _ has
been so positive that billboard companies nationwide have agreed to
donate millions of dollars' worth of space.
</P>
<P>
   And because Americans are considered the most devout population
in the industrialized world, according to a Gallup poll, it's only
natural that they'd want to spread this good news around.
</P>
<P>
   But I was struck by the rest of the Gallup findings. The poll
found that more than 70 percent of Americans are members of a
church or synagogue, and 40 percent attend regularly. Sixty percent
believe that religion can solve the vast majority of today's social
problems.
</P>
<P>
   So why do we need billboards to get us thinking about God?
Better yet, why is society in such a mess if we love the church so
much?
</P>
<P>
   Because attending church won't change society. It won't even
change us. Read those numbers again and consider our moral state.
</P>
<P>
   In the book of Luke, Christ said, ``No one can become my
disciple unless he first sits down and counts his blessings _ and
then renounces them all for me.''
</P>
<P>
   That tells me that I've got to be willing to give up something
to draw nearer to a holy God. I have to give up lying and cheating
and backbiting and hatred. It means I've got to be willing to give
up something big for something good.
</P>
<P>
   It ought to be said here that the organizers of the ``God
Speaks'' campaign are offering nondenominational messages. They
believe these messages should have meaning to anyone who believes
in a Supreme Being.
</P>
<P>
   I was certainly moved when I saw them. Ask my daughters. But
God's word is more than a string of stark white letters to get us
thinking about him. Allowed to penetrate our hearts, they change
who we are, and so how we treat one another.

   COMPAQ-EARNINGS _ AUSTIN _ Compaq Computer Corp. reported a $281
million first-quarter profit today that met its own recently
diminished forecast, hurt by stiff price competition and slow sales
of its most profitable business computers. (Mahoney, Austin
American-Statesman).
</P>
<P>
   COKE-EARNINGS _ Coca-Cola, which is holding its annual
shareholders meeting in Delaware today, reported a 13 percent drop
in first-quarter earnings as the soft drink maker continued to
suffer from a slowdown in some of its key markets. (Atlanta
Journal-Constitution).
</P>
<P>
   MEAD-EARNINGS _ Mead Corporation said Wednesday it earned $22.9
million, or 22 cents per share, in the first quarter, down from
$30.6 million or 29 cents per share in the same period in 1998. Net
sales for the first quarter of 1999 were $863.2 million, up 3
percent from $839.0 million in 1998, primarily due to unit growth.
(Dillon, Dayton Daily News). 6-8.
</P>
<P>
   NCR-EARNINGS _ NCR Corp. said Wednesday it earned $3.3 million,
or $0.03 per diluted share, for the first quarter ended March 31,
compared with breakeven in the year ago period. Operating income
improved $26 million from a loss of $34 million a year ago. The
results exceeded consensus analyst expectations. (Townsend, Dayton
Daily News). 9.

acquisition, too. (Bischoff, Dayton Daily News). 6-8.
</P>
<P>
   PBP-SUNBEAM _ Sunbeam finally gets around to releasing its
fourth quarter and 1998 numbers. The reason for the delay: all the
digits they had to write in to show the losses, $897,000,000 for
the year. The company blamed the loss on ``unusual'' costs such as
lawsuits, Y2K preparedness and payments to fired executives.
(Sedore, Palm Beach Post)

NATO PARTY TRANSFORMS INTO A WAR COUNCIL 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Corrects spelling of Socarides thruout)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MARY LEONARD  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ NATO's 50th birthday party has a lot of people
singing the blues.
</P>
<P>
   Starting at the top, Secretary of State Madeleine K. Albright
and national security adviser Samuel Berger in somber tones Tuesday
recast the celebration scheduled long ago for this weekend in
Washington as a nothing-but-work war summit over NATO's deepening
crisis in Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   Further down the White House command chain, Richard Socarides,
the official in charge of three days of luncheons, dinners,
meetings, press conferences, and making the motorcades of no fewer
than 44 world leaders run on time, laments that ``as a social
event, this summit is turning out as a bust.''
</P>
<P>
   Forty-two law enforcement agencies in the Washington area face
an unprecendented security assignment that was stressful to begin
with and only got worse when NATO started bombing Yugoslavia.
``We're prepared for anything,'' said Kenneth Piernick, an FBI
counterterrorism specialist, ``from simple assaults to weapons of
mass destruction.''
</P>
<P>
   And as for Washington tourists, here by the tens of thousands at
the height of the spring-vacation season, the red carpet rolling
out for NATO VIPs means a long weekend of frustration: airport
delays, traffic gridlock, closed museums, no White House tours, and
six square blocks of the capital cordoned off from anybody without
a special pass.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're going to hate me,'' said Karina Ferguson, a tour guide
anticipating the reaction of visitors when she tells them, come
Friday, it's Mount Vernon, George Washington's home in northern
Virginia, or nothing.
</P>
<P>
   Nobody is underestimating the significance of this NATO summit.
What could have been a predictable weekend of windy speeches,
self-congratulation, splendid parties, and an effusive welcome to
NATO's three newest members, Hungary, Poland, and the Czech
Republic, has suddenly switched to a strategic war council on
Kosovo that will test the alliance's mettle.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had planned a summit that focused a bit on the past and a
great deal on the future . . . but now it is necessary to have it
and to focus intensely on the present as well,'' Berger said at a
White House briefing Tuesday. ``Now this is going to be a working
meeting of a military alliance in the middle of a conflict.''
</P>
<P>
   The logistics of the summit were already daunting: How to greet,
move, protect, lodge, and entertain the heads of state, prime
ministers, and hundreds of other foreign dignitaries from 19 NATO
countries and as many as 25 NATO-affiliated nations. Consider, for
example, that diplomatic protocol demands the NATO leaders arrive
in alphabetical order (by country, English spelling) at a White
House dinner for 800 on Saturday night.
</P>
<P>
   Now, at the last minute, NATO officials have ripped up the
program and are improvising. The opening ceremony Friday morning
has been replaced by a three-hour meeting on Kosovo. A military
parade has been canceled, and an emergency session on humanitarian
aid may be held Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   A commemoration will take place Friday in the same Constitution
Avenue auditorium where the North Atlantic Treaty was signed 50
years ago, but NATO has nixed a warplane flyover as inappropriate.
</P>
<P>
   With images of bleak, Balkan refugee camps fresh on TV screens,
NATO also scratched black-tie events and anything not fitting a
theme of ``simple, serious, and dignified,'' said Socarides, a
special assistant to President Clinton and the summit's chief
operating officer. ``More work, less pomp and circumstance.''
</P>
<P>
   That's not to say socializing has been eliminated entirely. In
addition to the White House dinner in a tent on the South Lawn, the
president and Mrs. Clinton will greet guests at a more exclusive
party Friday evening, and Mrs. Clinton will host two luncheons for
VIP spouses. The cost of the summit, shared by the US government
and corporate sponsors, will be about $25 million.
</P>
<P>
   As Washington events go, the size of this summit is small with
about 5,000 attendees, including 3,000 journalists. (The Federation
of American Societies for Experimental Biology brought more than
11,000 conventioneers to the capital this week.) But in scale _ in
catering and floral arrangements, in fleets of limousines required,
in mobile phones in use, and certainly in security _ this is the
mother of all Washington weekends.
</P>
<P>
   The Secret Service is in charge of security, and it is leaving
no manhole or mailbox unsealed, no rooftop unguarded, no airspace
unpatrolled, no biological threat unchecked. To control the summit
area, the Secret Service is restricting the six square blocks
around Federal Triangle to NATO traffic only, and it has required
nine of the Smithsonian museums to close Friday.
</P>
<P>
   The District of Columbia will shut down its government and
public schools Friday, and 90,000 federal bureaucrats will get that
day off too, with pay.
</P>
<P>
   ``You have to assume there is a very high threat level,'' said
Chuck Vance, a Secret Service veteran who now runs a private
security firm in Washington.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have lived here 19 years, through some huge events on the
Mall and several presidential inaugurations, but I don't recall
anything like this,'' said Marie Tibor, vice president of the
Washington Convention and Visitor Association. ``If a rolling
motorcade excites you, this is the time to be here. For anyone
else, it presents a true challenge.''

<P>
   ``People Behind the Peace''
</P>
<P>
   By Ronald A. Wells
</P>
<P>
   Eerdmans, $13
</P>
<P>
   When looking at ``The Troubles'' of Northern Ireland at one
point, writes Ronald A. Wells, ``it seemed like nonsense (to some)
to say, `Religion has failed; give us more religion.' Christians,
for their part, agreed, or should have done so. Indeed, many
Christians should have said something more like `Religion has
failed; give us Christianity.' ''
</P>
<P>
   ``People Behind the Peace'' is Wells' sketch of three
residential communities seeking to embody the Christian idea of
``Blessed are the peacemakers'' in a region struggling with a
year-old peace plan. The Calvin College history professor also
provides an overview of Ireland's history and a discussion of the
concept of forgiveness in politics.
</P>
<P>
   Wells does not see forgiveness and reconciliation as easy (or as
the same thing), and although he is probably more ecumenically
minded than many readers, he is aware of the problems there, too.
Still, ``People Behind the Peace'' provides an encouraging glimpse
of people truly seeking to bring about accord in a region that
needs it badly. _ Reviewed by Alan Cochrum

   Revival
</P>
<P>
   Various artists
</P>
<P>
   Vineyard Music
</P>
<P>
   Revival is subtitled ``10 Songs From England, Brownsville,
Toronto and the World.'' It just as easily could have been called
``the soundtrack of the charismatic movement.''
</P>
<P>
   A resurgence of revivals in Toronto, the Brownsville Assembly of
God in Pensacola, Fla., and at other churches has given birth to
some wonderful praise and worship tunes. These songs are in common
usage in contemporary music churches that might even disagree with
the nature of true revival.
</P>
<P>
   Ten of the best are included in this compilation album from
Vineyard Music.
</P>
<P>
   The songs, featuring worship leaders Andy Park, Brian Doerksen,
David Ruis, Lindell Cooley and Danny Daniels, were recorded live,
and the passion that was present in those worship services is
evident.
</P>
<P>
   Highlights include the prayerful plea for revival on ``Light the
Fire Again,'' the call for unity on ``Break Dividing Walls'' and
the raw joy of ``We Will Dance.''
</P>
<P>
   It's not necessary to be charismatic or Pentecostal to enjoy
these songs, but they should come with a warning label. If you're
not careful, they might make you get up and dance and raise your
hands in praise.

 &HT;    UNITED PARCEL SERVICE CONTESTS $333 MILLION TAX BILL
 &HT;    Moving in (f) financial and (w) Washington categories
 &HT;    By JERRY MOSKAL
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON -- United Parcel Service has found itself with a
</P>
<P>
   package it would rather not accept -- a $333.3 million tax bill.
</P>
<P>
   That's how much the Internal Revenue Service is demanding the
Atlanta-based package-delivery company and its subsidiaries pay for
</P>
<P>
   the 1985-87 tax years. The bill includes $209 million in
additional taxes, $17.26 million in penalties and $107 million in
interest.
</P>
<P>
   UPS has filed a petition with the U.S. Tax Court in Washington,
seeking to
</P>
<P>
   overturn the IRS decision.
</P>
<P>
   The IRS claim for $209 million in additional taxes includes at
least $105 million in dispute in a still-undecided Tax Court case
covering 1983 and 1984, UPS spokesman Norman Black said. The rest
involves normal, year-end tax disagreements, he said.
</P>
<P>
   An IRS spokesman said the agency does not comment on pending tax
cases.
</P>
<P>
   Much of the alleged tax deficiency in the 1985-87 case stems
from the IRS denial of deductions for aircraft operation,
depreciation and repairs expended by United Parcel Service Company
Inc., the subsidiary that operates the company's air fleet.
</P>
<P>
   ``Every year there are disagreements on various aviation tax
issues,'' said Black. ``They are always worked out, and we're
confident we can work this out with the IRS.''
</P>
<P>
   (optional trim follows)
</P>
<P>
   UPS claims the IRS ``erroneously determined that (the)
petitioner is not entitled to deductions...for costs incurred by
UPSCO (the air fleet subsidiary) for the inspection and maintenance
of certain of UPSCO's aircraft rotable (CQ) parts,'' such as
engines.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, the petition complained, the IRS erred when it
found that UPSCO changed its method of accounting for aircraft and
inspection of those parts without ``requesting and receiving
permission'' from the agency.
</P>
<P>
   Because of those decisions, the petition said, the IRS ruled
</P>
<P>
   that the company had $42.3 million in additional taxable income.
</P>
<P>
   The petition added that the IRS erroneously found that $422.5
</P>
<P>
   million in ``excess value charges'' for the three-year period
</P>
<P>
   after $144.7 million in deductions should have been reported as
</P>
<P>
   taxable income.
</P>
<P>
   (end optional trim)
</P>
<P>
   The 222-page petition by UPS not only asks the court to find
that
</P>
<P>
   there is no tax deficiency for 1985-87, but that the company
</P>
<P>
   overpaid its 1986-87 taxes by an unspecified amount.
</P>
<P>
   (optional trim follows)
</P>
<P>
   According to the petition, the IRS also erred when it:
</P>
<P>
   Denied $89.28 million in deductions paid to Liberty Mutual Fire
Insurance Co. for worker's compensation coverage during the three
years.
</P>
<P>
   Failed to allow $4.86 million in depreciation deductions on
UPS's 15 package delivery centers.
</P>
<P>
   Would not allow UPS to take a $4.3 million deduction for
depreciation of the customer lists it acquired when it bought Hill
Truck Rentals Inc.
</P>
<P>
   Did not allow a $10 million deduction for a cancellation fee
paid in 1987 to Interstate Airlines and Air Traffic Service Corp.
for voiding an aircraft leasing agreement when the air fleet
subsidiary took over the operation of company-owned planes.
</P>
<P>
   Did not allow a deduction of more than $2.5 million spent on
loan
</P>
<P>
   fees.
</P>
<P>
   Decided that UPS should have capitalized and expensed over
</P>
<P>
   a number of years $32.8 million in interest, increasing the
</P>
<P>
   firm's taxable income by that amount for 1987.
</P>
<P>
   Disallowed a $5.2 million deductions for payments made for
</P>
<P>
   industrial relations service in 1985-87.
</P>
<P>
   Ruled that $6.18 million spent on research and development in
</P>
<P>
   1987 could not by written off.
</P>
<P>
   Denied $6.5 million in investment tax credits for the purchase
of new aircraft.
</P>
<P>
   Determined that almost $115 million spent on four new jet
</P>
<P>
   planes purchased in 1985 was not eligible for investment tax
</P>
<P>
   credits as new property.
</P>
<P>
   Would not allow investment tax credits for expenditures on
``used parts incorporated in the manufacture of the new aircraft''
</P>
<P>
   bought in 1986.
</P>
<P>
   The petition also maintains the IRS erred when it ruled that
</P>
<P>
   UPS could only capitalize $1.6 million for depreciation purposes
</P>
<P>
   instead of $4.55 million that was claimed in investment tax
</P>
<P>
   credits on its former headquarters in Greenwich, Conn.
</P>
<P>
   (end optional trim)
</P>
<P>
   The IRS issued its notice of deficiency Jan. 14, and has 60
</P>
<P>
   days to respond to UPS' April 14 petition. If the company and
</P>
<P>
   agency fail to negotiate a settlement, the case could go to
</P>
<P>
   trial before a tax court judge.

 c. 1998 Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   seating approximately 400.
</P>
<P>
   Kansas City's existing downtown theaters are all at least 60
years old. And their stages, far smaller than current standards,
cannot accommodate some touring shows _ even some ballet repertory.
The Music Hall has bad sightlines, and both it and the Lyric
Theatre have cramped seats and problematic acoustics.
</P>
<P>
   ``All of us have done our best to adapt to the facilities in the
city,'' said William Whitener, artistic director of State Ballet of
Missouri, which is based in the Lyric Theatre. ``But it's time for
Kansas City to join the many other cities in the nation that have
made commitments to state-of-the-art performance facilities.''
 &LR; brk:Design consideration  &LR; tx:Early on, there was concern that the
slope of the Perot property could be a problem. But a site proposal
by architect Charles Young concluded that the slope would actually
be an advantage, requiring less excavation for raked seating if the
two halls were positioned at right angles.
</P>
<P>
   The location also has the advantage of matchless freeway access
from all corners of the metropolitan area. And, although located
just outside the inner freeway loop, it's adjacent to Bartle Hall
and within four blocks of the other downtown performance halls,
hotels and the proposed Power &AMP; Light District.
</P>
<P>
   The foundation has talked with the city about building parking
garages on the north side of 16th street, to be shared between the
convention and performing arts centers.
</P>
<P>
   The Perot site also could connect the downtown loop to the
revitalization of the Crossroads and Freight House districts
immediately to the south, and from there to Union Station and Crown
Center. And there's been discussion of creating a parklike setting,
even a pond, on the southeast corner of the property.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a part of downtown we feel will really pick up,''
Kauffman said. ``I'm really excited about the site, personally.''
</P>
<P>
   The next challenge will be picking an architect for what will be
a very large complex on a dramatically exposed site. And Kauffman
has said all along she'd like the building to be designed by an
architect of international significance.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike the Nelson-Atkins Museum, which has picked six
architecture firms for a sketch competition to design an addition
and renovations, the Kauffman Foundation hasn't favored a
competition. But Dworak mentioned several architects the foundation
plans to consider: Charles Young, David Schwarz, Cesar Pelli, Moshe
Safdie, Frank Gehry, Rem Koolhaas and Rafael Vinoly.
</P>
<P>
   Kauffman earlier announced that the foundation had picked Artec
Consultants Inc. to design acoustics for the new facility. Founded
by Russell Johnson, the New York-based firm has been acclaimed for
its designs for, among others, the Morton Meyerson Symphony Center
in Dallas and Birmingham Symphony Hall in England. It also has
planned acoustics for facilities under construction in Philadelphia
and Miami.
</P>
<P>
   ``They've just created one superlative hall after another,''
said conductor Manson, who has been emphatic about the Kansas City
Symphony's need for a better concert hall. ``I think that this is
by far the best acoustical engineering firm in the world for
concert halls. They haven't had a single failure, and their recent
halls, in particular, have been exquisite.''
</P>
<P>
   Still to be determined is the future of the Lyric Theatre, now
home to Lyric Opera of Kansas City (which owns the building) and
the Kansas City Symphony, as well as the State Ballet.
</P>
<P>
   ``Clearly, for the next four of five years all the organizations
are going to continue to be housed there,'' said Evan Luskin, Lyric
Opera's general director. ``So I think it was a very good thing
that we were able to purchase the Lyric, in 1991. We will have been
here 13 or 14 years.
</P>
<P>
   ``We really have not been thinking about the implications (of a
new performing arts center) for the theater, and I think we're
going to have to do that. I don't have any answers for what will
happen five years out.''

 &HT;    UNITED PARCEL SERVICE CONTESTS $333 MILLION TAX BILL
 &HT;    Moving in (f) financial and (w) Washington categories
 &HT;    By JERRY MOSKAL
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON -- United Parcel Service has found itself with a
</P>
<P>
   package it would rather not accept -- a $333.3 million tax bill.
</P>
<P>
   That's how much the Internal Revenue Service is demanding the
Atlanta-based package-delivery company and its subsidiaries pay for
</P>
<P>
   the 1985-87 tax years. The bill includes $209 million in
additional taxes, $17.26 million in penalties and $107 million in
interest.
</P>
<P>
   UPS has filed a petition with the U.S. Tax Court in Washington,
seeking to
</P>
<P>
   overturn the IRS decision.
</P>
<P>
   The IRS claim for $209 million in additional taxes includes at
least $105 million in dispute in a still-undecided Tax Court case
covering 1983 and 1984, UPS spokesman Norman Black said. The rest
involves normal, year-end tax disagreements, he said.
</P>
<P>
   An IRS spokesman said the agency does not comment on pending tax
cases.
</P>
<P>
   Much of the alleged tax deficiency in the 1985-87 case stems
from the IRS denial of deductions for aircraft operation,
depreciation and repairs expended by United Parcel Service Company
Inc., the subsidiary that operates the company's air fleet.
</P>
<P>
   ``Every year there are disagreements on various aviation tax
issues,'' said Black. ``They are always worked out, and we're
confident we can work this out with the IRS.''
</P>
<P>
   (optional trim follows)
</P>
<P>
   UPS claims the IRS ``erroneously determined that (the)
petitioner is not entitled to deductions...for costs incurred by
UPSCO (the air fleet subsidiary) for the inspection and maintenance
of certain of UPSCO's aircraft rotable (CQ) parts,'' such as
engines.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, the petition complained, the IRS erred when it
found that UPSCO changed its method of accounting for aircraft and
inspection of those parts without ``requesting and receiving
permission'' from the agency.
</P>
<P>
   Because of those decisions, the petition said, the IRS ruled
</P>
<P>
   that the company had $42.3 million in additional taxable income.
</P>
<P>
   The petition added that the IRS erroneously found that $422.5
</P>
<P>
   million in ``excess value charges'' for the three-year period
</P>
<P>
   after $144.7 million in deductions should have been reported as
</P>
<P>
   taxable income.
</P>
<P>
   (end optional trim)
</P>
<P>
   The 222-page petition by UPS not only asks the court to find
that
</P>
<P>
   there is no tax deficiency for 1985-87, but that the company
</P>
<P>
   overpaid its 1986-87 taxes by an unspecified amount.
</P>
<P>
   (optional trim follows)
</P>
<P>
   According to the petition, the IRS also erred when it:
</P>
<P>
   Denied $89.28 million in deductions paid to Liberty Mutual Fire
Insurance Co. for worker's compensation coverage during the three
years.
</P>
<P>
   Failed to allow $4.86 million in depreciation deductions on
UPS's 15 package delivery centers.
</P>
<P>
   Would not allow UPS to take a $4.3 million deduction for
depreciation of the customer lists it acquired when it bought Hill
Truck Rentals Inc.
</P>
<P>
   Did not allow a $10 million deduction for a cancellation fee
paid in 1987 to Interstate Airlines and Air Traffic Service Corp.
for voiding an aircraft leasing agreement when the air fleet
subsidiary took over the operation of company-owned planes.
</P>
<P>
   Did not allow a deduction of more than $2.5 million spent on
loan
</P>
<P>
   fees.
</P>
<P>
   Decided that UPS should have capitalized and expensed over
</P>
<P>
   a number of years $32.8 million in interest, increasing the
</P>
<P>
   firm's taxable income by that amount for 1987.
</P>
<P>
   Disallowed a $5.2 million deductions for payments made for
</P>
<P>
   industrial relations service in 1985-87.
</P>
<P>
   Ruled that $6.18 million spent on research and development in
</P>
<P>
   1987 could not by written off.
</P>
<P>
   Denied $6.5 million in investment tax credits for the purchase
of new aircraft.
</P>
<P>
   Determined that almost $115 million spent on four new jet
</P>
<P>
   planes purchased in 1985 was not eligible for investment tax
</P>
<P>
   credits as new property.
</P>
<P>
   Would not allow investment tax credits for expenditures on
``used parts incorporated in the manufacture of the new aircraft''
</P>
<P>
   bought in 1986.
</P>
<P>
   The petition also maintains the IRS erred when it ruled that
</P>
<P>
   UPS could only capitalize $1.6 million for depreciation purposes
</P>
<P>
   instead of $4.55 million that was claimed in investment tax
</P>
<P>
   credits on its former headquarters in Greenwich, Conn.
</P>
<P>
   (end optional trim)
</P>
<P>
   The IRS issued its notice of deficiency Jan. 14, and has 60
</P>
<P>
   days to respond to UPS' April 14 petition. If the company and
</P>
<P>
   agency fail to negotiate a settlement, the case could go to
</P>
<P>
   trial before a tax court judge.

SPRINT MEETING OFFERS GOOD NEWS, LABOR STRIFE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By TED SICKINGER  
 c. 1998 Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Shareholders at Sprint Corp.'s annual meeting Tuesday got more
than the usual coffee, cookies and corporate pep talk.
</P>
<P>
   Yes, earnings were up in the first quarter. The company had a
big year. And shareholders will get a 2-for-1 stock split.
</P>
<P>
   But before they could enter Sprint's headquarters on Shawnee
Mission Parkway, shareholders had to run a gantlet of
placard-waving union members calling for a kinder, gentler
workplace and protesting the generous pay package of Chairman and
Chief Executive William T. Esrey.
</P>
<P>
   About 75 members of the Communication Workers of America and
International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers lined Shawnee
Mission Parkway before the meeting, shouting their message to
passing traffic: ``Hey, hey, ho, ho, corporate greed has got to
go.''
</P>
<P>
   Esrey received about $24 million in direct compensation in 1998
and has amassed stock options in the last two years worth about
$240 million, as of the close of business Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, the company has frozen base pay for about 3,000
employees in the company's local telephone division, introduced
incentive-pay plans and imposed mandatory sales quotas.
</P>
<P>
   The unions contend those plans are unfair to many workers.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're hoping to let share owners know that the exorbitant
salary of Bill Esrey is a parasitic act off the backs of workers,''
said Jim Brimer, a spokesman for the International Brotherhood of
Electrical Workers. ``Sprint's refusal to bargain with us over
clearly negotiable items has got to stop.''
</P>
<P>
   The company says the plans are necessary for the company to
remain competitive in a rapidly changing industry and have actually
resulted in increased pay for 77 percent of the affected employees.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we don't sell our customers those products and services,
some competitors will sell them, and our business will diminish and
jobs will go away,'' Esrey told union workers in the meeting.
</P>
<P>
   Inside Sprint's headquarters Tuesday, the audience was
considerably calmer. Some shareholders offered effusive praise for
management, and even union members acknowledged the ``financial
wizardry'' that led to a 65 percent total return on Sprint's stock
in 1998 and an additional 37 percent so far this year.
</P>
<P>
   There was more good news on that front, as the company reported
another solid quarter of earnings growth in its core businesses and
announced a 2-for-1 stock split of the company's FON stock,
effective June 4 for shareholders of record May 13.
</P>
<P>
   First-quarter profit at Sprint's FON Group, which includes all
operations except its Sprint PCS wireless phone business, rose 16
percent to $406.2 million, or 93 cents a share, from $351.2
million, or 80 cents, a year earlier.
</P>
<P>
   The results surpass the 90-cent average estimate of analysts
surveyed by First Call Corp. Sprint's stock Tuesday rose 3, to 100.
</P>
<P>
   ``There were no surprises here,'' said Tony Ferrugia, an analyst
with A.G. Edwards in St. Louis. ``The results were strong, as
expected. It was a solid quarter for Sprint.''
</P>
<P>
   Sales in Sprint's FON group rose 7 percent to $4.17 billion. The
company rang up record sales in its long-distance division as more
residential customers signed up for its dime-a-minute calling plans
and businesses used more data and Internet services.
</P>
<P>
   Revenue from Internet and other data services surged 50 percent
during the quarter. And overall calling volume, or minutes of
traffic on Sprint's network, rose 24 percent from a year ago.
</P>
<P>
   Sales also were strong in the company's local division as it
boosted its number of local phone lines 5.2 percent, to 7.8
million.
</P>
<P>
   The increases helped Sprint boost FON group operating income 8
percent to $737 million.
</P>
<P>
   ``The FON Group's first-quarter performance reflected
exceptional execution across the board,'' Esrey said.
</P>
<P>
   Not including losses from Sprint's new businesses, Sprint said
the FON Group earned $1.10 a share, up from 96 cents a year
earlier.
</P>
<P>
   Losses at its Global One joint venture with France Telecom and
Deutsche Telekom narrowed to 10 cents a share from 13 cents a year
ago. The international venture has been troubled since its
inception and is the subject of speculation as the partners decide
whether to reorganize or dissolve the partnership.
</P>
<P>
   Esrey said the company should begin to make meaningful progress
toward profitability this year.
</P>
<P>
   Sprint is upgrading its phone network to offer high-speed voice,
data and video services. Continued construction of that network,
known as ION or Integrated On-Demand Network, cost the company an
additional 7 cents a share in the first quarter, wider than 2 cents
a share in the first quarter of 1998.
</P>
<P>
   Sprint is beta-testing ION at seven large businesses and a total
of 29 sites across the country. It plans to begin testing consumer
and small-business versions this summer and release them in
selected markets at the end of this year.
</P>
<P>
   The company expects to spend up to an additional $700 million to
construct the network, which combines voice and data on one
platform.
</P>
<P>
   As expected, the company's Sprint PCS wireless operation is
still in the red. Its net loss for the quarter widened to $625.6
million, or $1.46 a share, from $145.2 million, or 97 cents, a year
earlier. The loss includes a charge of 5 cents a share related to
the prepayment of debt.
</P>
<P>
   Revenue at Sprint PCS almost tripled from a year earlier, to
$604 million. The company turned on service in 50 markets during
the quarter, including Atlanta and Chicago, and added 763,000
customers _ a record for any U.S. wireless company in the
traditionally slack first quarter.
</P>
<P>
   The company ended the quarter with 3.35 million customers and
expects a total subscriber growth of more than 3 million this year.

FOUNDER OF MRS. FIELDS COOKIES SHARES RECIPE FOR SUCCESS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JILIAN MINCER  
 c. 1998 Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   (Kansas City, Mo.) _ Debbi Fields had a dream. She wanted to
open a store that sold fresh-baked cookies.
</P>
<P>
   The idea seemed outrageous in 1977, especially when it was
suggested by a 20-year-old who didn't have a college degree or any
business experience.
</P>
<P>
   Even her own family thought it was ludicrous. But Fields spent
eight months trying to get a loan, always arriving at the bank with
a fresh batch of her cookies.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't have money, but I had a dream, and I had a recipe,''
said Fields, who founded Mrs. Fields Cookies and currently consults
for the $250 million company. ``I figured my greatest failure was
not to try.''
</P>
<P>
   A banker who liked her passion, conviction and cookies finally
lent her the $25,000 she used to launch the cookie empire.
</P>
<P>
   Fields, who sold the company in 1993 but remains on its
executive board, was in Kansas City on Tuesday for Sweet Ambitions.
The event is sponsored by the Mid-Continent Council of Girl Scouts
as part of activities for Take Our Daughters to Work Day.
</P>
<P>
   The Ms. Foundation established Take Our Daughters to Work Day in
1993 in response to studies that found that girls often lost
self-confidence and self-esteem as they reached adolescence.
</P>
<P>
   Thousands of girls are expected to head to the workplace
Thursday to learn about their parents' jobs. One-third of American
companies participated last year, according to a Roper Starch
Worldwide poll.
</P>
<P>
   About 1,000 girls and adults Tuesday attended the sold-out Sweet
Ambitions event at the Westin Crown Center.
</P>
<P>
   Fields, a former Girl Scout and the mother of five girls, said
her recipe for success was one-third passion, one-third perfection
and one-third perseverance.
</P>
<P>
   ``I may not have been talented, but I was willing to work
hard,'' she said. ``I believe that whatever you do, you have to
give it your all.''
</P>
<P>
   Fields doesn't think failure is bad. It just means that you have
to stop what you're doing and try something else.
</P>
<P>
   She recalled the day she opened her first store in 1977. She had
designed the store to look like her kitchen so customers could
watch her bake.
</P>
<P>
   When no one came that first day, she brought the cookies to
them. Sales that first year reached $250,000, far greater than
anyone dreamed.
</P>
<P>
   Fields credits Girl Scouting and her father, who was a welder,
with teaching important lessons to her.
</P>
<P>
   ``My dad said you always have to love what you do,'' she said.
``He always said you are wealthy if you have true friends, family
and love what you do.''
</P>
<P>
   She said Scouting taught her skills she didn't have _ and taught
her about s'mores.
</P>
<P>
   Today, she spends about eight days a month away from home but is
constantly in touch with her daughters, who range in age from 7 to
19.
</P>
<P>
   And, yes, she still loves baking cookies.
</P>
<P>
   ``Cookies, to me, is the universal gift of friendship,'' she
said. ``When you share cookies, you're sharing part of your
heart.''

WHILE CUSTOMERS FRET ON HOLD 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Attn: Ohio, Ill., Wash.)   (af)  
 By BRUCE HEADLAM   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   It's 11:30 p.m., your hard drive has crashed and you have been
on hold to the manufacturer's support line so long you would swear
you had heard that Bob Seger song three times already. Your
computer may be irreparable. But would some different music help?
</P>
<P>
   James Kellaris, an associate professor of marketing at the
University of Cincinnati, recently compared four kinds of music
used by companies for customers who are on hold: classical, light
jazz, old rock and alternative rock. As part of the study, 71
clients of a technology company listened to six-minute time blocks
in each of the styles. Then they estimated how long they had waited
and recorded their reactions to the music.
</P>
<P>
   To no one's surprise, the subjects overestimated the amount of
time they spent on hold. ``Of course, we already knew that,''
Kellaris said.
</P>
<P>
   What did surprise him was that women and men had very different
reactions to the music. Men reacted most favorably to classical
music and estimated the wait as the shortest (6.8 minutes). In
contrast, women perceived the classical music wait to be the
longest (7.6 minutes). Women preferred light jazz, estimating that
wait as the shortest (6.6 minutes).
</P>
<P>
   The issue may be more than simply a matter of taste. ``A lot of
customers in this product category are baby boomers so we expected
that the rock oldies format would produce a good response,''
Kellaris said. ``But it produced the least favorable reaction
across the two groups.''
</P>
<P>
   Familiarity, he said, may breed contempt. ``The women may have
been more familiar with the classical music,'' he suggested. ``When
people hear part of a piece of music they know, they infer the
whole piece. So they think that they were on hold longer.''
</P>
<P>
   The results also surprised Gordon Bruner, associate professor at
Southern Illinois University and a leader in the field of consumer
time perception.
</P>
<P>
   ``Stereotypically,'' he said, ``men like hard rock and women
like soft rock. But with music, the question I'd ask is: do we want
people to say `they play music we like' or to say `so what?' if
they liked it. They stayed on the line. That's the bottom line.''
</P>
<P>
   At the Muzak Corp., where music is the bottom line, one
executive expressed skepticism that music choice really affected
perceived waiting time. Reached at the Muzak headquarters in
Seattle (after two long minutes on hold with Billy Joel's ``River
of Dreams''), Kenneth Kahn, vice president for marketing, said that
``almost all our concerns have to do with the message, not the
music.'' Muzak designs on-hold messages for many technology
companies, including Cisco Systems and Microsoft.
</P>
<P>
   Can Muzak learn anything from the study? Kellaris did joke that
companies might offer an option: ``If you are male, please press 1.
If you are female, please press 2.'' In the meantime, the less
offensive compromise appears to be alternative rock (7.18 minutes).
As for old-style elevator music, he did not even bother with a
test. ``Too many associations with root canals,'' he said.

DOWNLOADING MORE SPEED FOR A MODEM 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By J.D. BIERSDORFER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Q. I read that I can upgrade the speed of my modem by
downloading software from the Web. How does this work?
</P>
<P>
   A. What you are referring to is sometimes called a firmware or
flash upgrade. If the software is compatible with your modem, you
can indeed increase the speed of the device without buying a new
one.
</P>
<P>
   The modem's firmware, which is a combination of hardware and
software, controls its operation. The software is written into the
read-only memory (ROM), and it works with the memory chip in the
hardware. For their firmware, some modem makers use ``flash ROM,''
which can be erased and reprogrammed with new data.
</P>
<P>
   If you are thinking about using a flash upgrade, you should call
your modem manufacturer or visit the company's Web site for more
information and to make sure you can actually upgrade your model.
Most sites offer specific instructions on how to proceed, as well
as the necessary software available for downloading. You can damage
your modem if you don't install the upgrade properly, so read the
information carefully.
</P>
<P>
   At members.home.net/v90/modemhelp.htm, you'll find a helpful
list of manufacturers' Web sites. Be sure to check with your
Internet service provider to make sure that it can handle the
faster connection.

   The long-vacant hillside south of Bartle Hall will be the site
of a performing arts center likely to cost $225 million.
</P>
<P>
   The Muriel McBrien Kauffman Foundation, which has been
researching and planning for a new performing arts center for the
last four years, has signed a purchase agreement for the 18-acre
site roughly bounded by 16th Street on the north, 17th Street on
the south, Broadway on the west and Wyandotte Street on the east.
</P>
<P>
   The 90-day ``due diligence'' agreement gives the buyer time to
check environmental facets, title and other issues. But Julia Irene
Kauffman, the foundation's CEO, said, ``I don't see any reason why
this won't be the site for the performing arts center.''
</P>
<P>
   In the best of circumstances, between design and construction
phases, a new facility won't open its doors for five or six years.
But the site represents a tangible commitment to the long-discussed
performing arts center.
</P>
<P>
   With its pronounced slope toward the southeast, the site is by
far the most dramatic _ and the largest _ of seven alternatives,
all downtown, that were considered.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it's a wonderful location,'' said Anne Manson, music
director designate of the Kansas City Symphony. ``For one thing,
the view is beautiful. For another, there's a lot of land there to
be developed.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it would be a great setting for the new concert hall,
especially if there were a lot of landscaping and maybe some
restaurants.''
</P>
<P>
   Kauffman declined to disclose the cost of the property, which is
owned by the family of Texas entrepreneur Ross Perot, other than to
say, ``It was reasonable...a compromise.''
</P>
<P>
   Nor did Kauffman disclose how much the $250 million foundation
established by her late mother would contribute toward the new
complex. But she said a figure probably will be announced soon
after the 90-day investigation period.
</P>
<P>
   ``Let's just say it will be substantial,'' she said, ``more than
substantial.''
SUB HED--Two halls-SUB HEAD  &LR; tx:Kauffman did say the plan calls for
two halls: a non-proscenium symphony hall and a proscenium theater
for opera, ballet and stage productions. The $225 million figure
includes a substantial endowment to support ongoing operations.
</P>
<P>
   Coming on the heels of major fund drives for Science City at
Union Station and the Nelson-Atkins Museum of Art, and with a drive
for Liberty Memorial in the works, this could be a challenge for
area funding sources.
</P>
<P>
   ``But most of the other drives are winding down,'' said Ken
Dworak, the foundation's project manager for the performing arts
center. ``And this will be six years before opening, so we've got
some time.''
</P>
<P>
   The two-hall configuration was the virtually unanimous
recommendation of area arts leaders and leading theater and
acoustical consultants brought in to study local needs.
</P>
<P>
   For one thing, the different art forms have very different
physical and acoustical needs. For another, a single multipurpose
facility would be a scheduling nightmare for organizations at the
mercy of touring artists' schedules.
</P>
<P>
   Discussion has centered on seating capacities of 1,800 to 1,900
for each hall. (By contrast, the Folly Theater seats approximately
1,100; the Lyric Theatre 1,600; the Music Hall 2,400; and the
Midland Theatre 2,700.)
</P>
<P>
   But Kauffman said the opera-ballet theater might be made
slightly larger to accommodate touring Broadway shows. The center
also might include a third theater seating approximately 400. MORE

   (BEGIN ITALIC)I've seen a look in dog's eyes, a quickly
vanishing look of amazed contempt, and I am convinced that
basically dogs think humans are nuts.(END ITALIC) _ John Steinbeck
</P>
<P>
   Unless the Humane Society or PETA intervenes soon, the first
ever Take-Your-Dog-to-Work Day will take place on June 25.
</P>
<P>
   Sponsored by Pet Sitters International, Take-Your-Dog-to-Work
Day is intended _ and I quote _ to ``demonstrate that dogs aren't
just good pets, they make good co-workers, too!''
</P>
<P>
   I am staring right now at Buster, who is a pug and therefore
technically a dog, and I am failing to see any good co-worker
potential unless your definition of a good co-worker is someone who
sleeps 18 hours a day, rousing himself only as long as it takes to
pee on the kitchen floor and/or bark at random oxygen molecules
that threaten to break into the house.
</P>
<P>
   (I have seen office workers who, after attending one too many
meetings, behave in a similar fashion, but that has little or
nothing to do with the issue at hand, so let us move on.)
</P>
<P>
   Dogs are skilled in many areas (shedding, digging, chewing), but
I have yet to meet one that can file, set up a conference call or
steal change from the coffee fund without anyone noticing.
</P>
<P>
   You could not count on a dog to bring in a dozen doughnuts
(intact) every Wednesday, nor could you depend on it to think up
something pithy and original every time a birthday or get-well card
was passed around.
</P>
<P>
   While a dog is probably just as capable of mastering computers
as most people, it would not experience the same feelings of anger,
frustration and futility that make the machines so fascinating to
humans. I may be proved wrong, but I cannot see a dog taking a
sledgehammer to a recalcitrant PC or tying a stout chain to a balky
modem and using it as a boat anchor. Fear and loathing of computers
are integral ingredients of the thin glue that bond office
employees to one another. A dog may drool on the keyboard or issue
a low growl when the words ``system error'' appear on the screen,
but beyond that it finds the whole subject rather boring.
</P>
<P>
   Some people may worry about dogs bringing fleas into the work
place, but if anything, it's the dogs that should be concerned
about the multitude of poxes and plagues that waft through the
office like the odor of scorched microwave popcorn.
</P>
<P>
   A bright-eyed dog that at home is always up for a brisk game of
Frisbee or slobber-on-the-tennis-ball would see its health
deteriorate quickly in the office environment. Aside from the
occasional desultory shuffle to the office vending machine for some
stale pretzels, there are few opportunities for vigorous exercise
in the average office. Indeed, employees who sit up on their
haunches with a gleam in the their eye and a stick in their mouth
are not only seldom rewarded with a game of fetch but are often
overlooked, or worse, when raise time rolls around.
</P>
<P>
   Miners used to take canaries into the shafts as a primitive form
of pollution alert. When the canary keeled over, the miners knew
the air had become too poisonous to breathe and it was time to get
out.
</P>
<P>
   I cannot help but wonder if there is some of the same sort of
thinking behind the idea of bringing dogs into the work place.
</P>
<P>
   Or, to put it another way, as Edward Abbey once said, ``When a
man's best friend is his dog, that dog has a problem.''
</P>
<P>
   Either way, my advice to dogs is, come June 25, you might want
to hide under the bed.

GUITARIST JOEY MOLLAND KEEPS BADFINGER ALIVE AND ON THE ROAD 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By BILL DeYOUNG   
 The Gainesville (Fla.) Sun   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   In the early 1970s, the British-Welsh band Badfinger turned out
a half-dozen stunning records. The band foreshadowed the ``power
pop'' sound with a combination of hard-rocking guitars, big beats
and luscious harmony vocals.
</P>
<P>
   It all came to a tragic end with the 1975 suicide of guitarist
Pete Ham, who'd composed and sung some of the band's biggest hits:
``No Matter What,'' ``Day After Day'' and ``Baby Blue.'' Eight
years later, bassist Tom Evans killed himself, too, after trying _
and failing _ to re-light the Badfinger flame.
</P>
<P>
   Today, Joey Molland, the band's lead guitarist and a
contributing songwriter, tours the country under the Badfinger
name, backed by a bassist and drummer and playing the songs that
took him from his native Liverpool so many years ago and made him
part of a rock 'n' roll legend.
</P>
<P>
   ``We do the same thing as we've always done, a bunch of
Badfinger songs from the different records, and some of my songs
from the solo records, and one or two new songs,'' said Molland,
50, in a telephone interview from his home in Minnesota.
``Depending on what the crowd is like. I've been doing a solo
version of `Name of the Game' onstage, things like that. Try and
play a couple of Pete's songs, tell people about him a little
bit.''
</P>
<P>
   Today, Badfinger is warmly regarded as a pioneering group. Their
albums _ originally issued on the Beatles' Apple Records label _
are top catalog sellers on CD.
</P>
<P>
   Molland says VH1 has prepared a segment of its top-rated
``Behind the Music'' series on Badfinger's rise and fall. ``I guess
it's all ready to go,'' he said. ``It's been put back until
September because of some type of Beatle involvement, maybe. They'd
like to get those guys involved if they could. I mean, I doubt if
that's going to happen, myself.''
</P>
<P>
   After several prolonged legal battles over Badfinger issues,
Molland has fallen out with drummer Mike Gibbins, the other
surviving member, who lives in Orlando, Fla. ``There's a dispute
going on in the courts now, and frankly I doubt if I'll ever talk
to the guy again, after what he's said about me,'' Molland said.
</P>
<P>
   Nor is the guitarist happy with ``Without You: The Tragic Story
of Badfinger,'' a hefty biography published two years ago. Author
Dan Matovina painted Molland and his American-born wife _ both of
whom declined to be interviewed for the book _ as self-obsessed and
difficult.
</P>
<P>
   ``What's amazing about it is how people believe it,'' says
Molland, who said he hasn't read the book. ``People just swallow it
hook, line and sinker. I've had people arguing with me about what
happened with the band, because this guy said that's what happened.
It's outrageous, and I'm doing my best to stay away from it.''
</P>
<P>
   Molland prefers ``Badfinger,'' filmmaker Gary Katz' video
biography, released almost simultaneously with the book. ``The
video turned out good,'' he says. ``And we've had a lot of
compliments on it, just because it doesn't bull---- around. It just
tells the story.''

TAXPAYERS STUCK WITH S&AMP;L DEBACLE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JERRY HEASTER  
 c. 1998 Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Most taxpayers don't know it, but Washington's mishandling of
the savings and loan industry promises to cost them billions more
well into the next century.
</P>
<P>
   A judge recently ordered the U.S. government to pay $909 million
to a California thrift institution. The lawsuit by Glendale Federal
Bank alleged a breach of contract linked to a long-ago Washington
initiative promoting private takeovers of failing S&AMP;Ls as an
alternative to their government-financed liquidation.
</P>
<P>
   The cost of resolving the thrift crisis is estimated at $165
billion. An additional 125 similar suits are pending against the
feds, and officials say each $1 billion in settlements will cost
$10 per household. Depending on judgments and appeals, an
additional $30 billion to $50 billion could be added to the thrift
bailout bill.
</P>
<P>
   Despite what happens, this regulatory fiasco stands as the
quintessential example of government failure. While liberals are
fond of citing market failure as justification for regulatory
intrusions, they never address the problem of government failure.
</P>
<P>
   The thrift industry debacle, however, should be in every
introductory economics text as the classic example of how
government failure can be as devastating as market failure.
</P>
<P>
   The continuing problem of today traces its origins to early '80s
legislation creating myriad tax incentives designed to spur real
estate development activity and thus rejuvenate the economy. The
tax reform legislation of the mid-1980s, however, took away many of
the tax breaks bestowed earlier. The resulting damage to those
responding to the incentives blindsided thrift institutions with
mounting exposure to bad loans.
</P>
<P>
   As the difficulties mounted, some institutions began to collapse
under the weight of loans going sour. Eventually the insurance fund
designed to keep depositors whole was overwhelmed and its looming
depletion prompted government authorities to seek out sound
financial institutions to take over failing ones.
</P>
<P>
   The bait government used was tax breaks and promises to suspend
accounting mandates designed to ensure institutional integrity. One
key was allowing healthy thrifts a special dispensation that came
to be known as ``supervisory good will,'' which was essentially an
exemption from regulatory capital requirements.
</P>
<P>
   The economy was in recession at the time, and government was
reluctant to force mass liquidations that would make the downturn
worse. As the problem became increasingly intractable, though, a
search for scapegoats was inevitable. Subsequent legislation
withdrew permission to count supervisory good will as capital, a
betrayal that left many institutions in the position of being
legally insolvent.
</P>
<P>
   Many managers of healthy S&AMP;Ls who had acquired failing firms in
good faith found themselves in expensive legal fights to fend off
government attempts to make them financially and criminally liable
for the mess.
</P>
<P>
   The fault, though, was government duplicity. Now the truth is
finally coming to light as a result of lawsuits brought by those
that government sought to make scapegoats.
</P>
<P>
   Unfortunately, and as usual, it will be the taxpayer who pays
for government's failure, both coming and going.

<P>
   MILAN, Italy _ Wriggling derrieres replaced chattering into cell
phones as the signature gesture at the Milan furniture fair, the
world's premier showcase of forward-thinking design.
</P>
<P>
   Visitors did wriggle as fast as they could in the deflatable
Memo chair by Ron Arad of England while it transformed from squishy
beanbag to body-molded nest as the air was sucked out.
</P>
<P>
   They gyrated with hula-hooping ease in a tubular steel chair
with a hammock-sling seat by Achille Castiglioni, the octogenarian
modernist, and his collaborator, Ferruccio Laviani.
</P>
<P>
   And at B&AMP; B Italia, a jump-suited engineer was on hand to help
weaklings crank Antonio Citterio's Freetime chaise _ a recliner as
only a Milanese would interpret it, in swank wool cashmere.
</P>
<P>
   In a year with no big-bang design movements, with minimalism
still dominating 5 million square feet of exhibition space, with
some furniture factories only a dozen miles from the border with
the former Yugoslavia, and war on everyone's mind, unease pervaded
the 38th annual fair, which ended April 18. Furniture seemed to be
slouching toward the millennium. The search for relief was on.
</P>
<P>
   Buyers and manufacturers from 140 countries, along with magazine
editors in search of hip trends, were looking for high style and
technological wonder, to be sure, but also for balm for the urban
soul.
</P>
<P>
   ``Change is so fast, people can't compete with it,'' said
Sven-Anwar Bibi, 27, a Cologne designer in a trio called Kombinat.
The team christened its first installation _ or was it a manifesto?
_ ``Homesick.'' It was an elegantly monastic refuge of three
compartments: paneled walnut walls, with a single bed, desk and
bench as built-ins. ``The wood of our childhood,'' Bibi explained,
``to remind us of a time which is much slower than now. We need
that.'' Designed for a populace yearning for permanence _ furniture
without wheels is a good place to start _ the assertive immobility
of this modern cloister seemed to touch a nerve in the Satellite
pavilion, the fair's showcase for young innovators.
</P>
<P>
   Among the 162,555 attendees, a relatively sober mood prevailed
in spite of buoyant business. In Italy, new furniture sales
increased from $16.8 billion in 1997 to $18 billion in 1998 with
exports to the United States up by 3.3 percent to $972 million in
1998. (The United States is still the second largest customer,
after Germany.)
</P>
<P>
   The mild shock of seeing the young and avant-garde developing
high-concept furniture for slowing down was reinforced by Philips,
the mainstream Dutch electronics company, which displayed a House
of the Future with a distinctly nostalgic bent. ``Emotion
containers'' _ stainless steel cones that digitally capture the
image, voice and scent of beloved family members _ may soothe a
homesick 21st-century Willy Loman _ but why not simply give the
kids a good-night kiss?
</P>
<P>
   More useful, perhaps, was the Interactive Tablecloth made of
washable linen and woven with power circuits. It promised to supply
current for lights, appliances and warming plates without singeing
a fingertip. A Philips spokesman said the tablecloth could be
available within five years _ that is, unless it joins the ranks of
other obsolescence-bound improvements from yesterday's Houses of
Tomorrow.
</P>
<P>
   A testy appreciation for the past rippled through the fair, even
among the most technologically daring. ``The first day of the next
millennium is going to look a lot like the last day of this
millennium,'' Arad said. ``Televisions get slimmer and slimmer and
computers get more sophisticated, but tables and chairs and sofas
have stayed more or less the same. The modern chair peaked in the
1950s with Charles and Ray Eames, George Nelson, Arne Jacobsen, and
after that there was very little revolution.''
</P>
<P>
   Arad promptly overturned his own theory by supplying the fair
with some of its most challenging entries. A pair of vases made of
plastic resin and polymer wire were created with the latest design
technology, called rapid prototyping: ``I put my idea into a
computer, it's translated over the phone to Holland and delivered
here in finished form the next day,'' Arad explained.
</P>
<P>
   His Memo chair for Inflate Design Studio of London suggested
that if the times are not relaxing, people have at least relaxed
their idea of what a piece of furniture should look like. He spoke
of Memo, which is high-performance vinyl filled with polystyrene
balls, as ``infinitely adjustable.'' And it is _ so long as there's
a pump or vacuum cleaner.
</P>
<P>
   ``You have to stay quite rigidly in place for it to work,'' said
Matty J. Veldkamp, a visitor, as she tried to carve out room for
her elbows as the chair hardened around her. ``It's really quite an
effort.'' Ms. Veldkamp, a senior adviser at the Dutch Ministry of
Education, Culture and Science, also questioned whether a vacuum
cleaner was the right accessory for a stylish living room. (Decide
for yourself: the chair will be at Totem, the New York store, in
May, starting at $350.)

<P>
   Jasper Morrison, the London designer, looked inside his
girlfriend's Prada shoes for inspiration. His Low-Pad and High-Pad
chairs for Cappellini display a clipboard-thin profile with
cushions in bas-relief. The lightness and model-thin silhouette
clearly delighted this 39-year-old minimalist, but he quickly
added: ``You've got quite a lot of padding. I have a very bad back,
so it's become a major issue with me that the chair really has to
support in the right way.'' The chairs could well take airport
furniture to a higher level and will be sold through Cappellini and
Modern Age in New York, starting in May, at $554.
</P>
<P>
   The Mad Max Award
</P>
<P>
   A study in tactile dissonance, Hi Square, a sofa by Massimo
Morozzi for Edra, is ``the furniture equivalent of the Sex
Pistols,'' said Paola Antonelli, a design curator at the Museum of
Modern Art in New York. In a nod to trendy straw-bale houses _ or
to a nostalgic hayride? _ its milky translucent polyurethane
cushions are stuffed with a straw lookalike (actually, a flax
fiber). In high-fashion counterpoint, the padded neoprene frame is
a gleaming lacquer red. Buyers beware: Cushions may be sticky when
hot, so this may not be ideal for a miniskirt. The Dr. Scholl Award
</P>
<P>
   For its luminous blue-and-green transparency and squishability,
nothing beat Werner Aisslinger's Soft Cell gel-furniture,
upholstered with polyurethane used to pad bicycle saddles and
wheelchairs. No bed sores.
</P>
<P>
   The Techno-Hut Award
</P>
<P>
   New materials don't have to result in new forms. Hella
Jongerius, a Dutch designer who is now working on Donna Karan's
home collection, based her Kasese chair on one made of sticks she
found in a church in Uganda. ``It was poetry,'' she said, ``and it
made me think, ``Well, what is our poetry?' Can I translate this
for the '90s, in high-tech materials, into something you can
love?'' (It folds up, too.)
</P>
<P>
   She remade it in lightweight carbon, knitted and woven to look
like animal skin, and covered the seat in neoprene or a
dramatically folksy felt that looks like shaggy goat hide. Murray
Moss, the owner of the New York store Moss, saw it and said, ``It's
primitive yet highly informed, it's jarring, and yet you have to
smile.''
</P>
<P>
   The Great Reveal
</P>
<P>
   Cassina and Flexform were among the many companies
reinterpreting the ingenious tubular-steel experiments of the early
modern masters Le Corbusier, Charlotte Perriand and Marcel Breuer.
A graceful arc of tubing joins chunky leather back and low-slung
seat cushions in a new Flexform chair by Citterio. The seat slides
and the back tilts without shedding any James Bond cool. And the
Nest sofa by Piero Lissoni for Cassina exposes its frame, as pliant
at its corners as a line of ballerinas bending at the bar.
</P>
<P>
   The Not-Afraid-to-Flirt Award
</P>
<P>
   Emmemobili, an Italian furniture manufacturer, threw minimalism
a few welcome curves with an elegant wall shelf made of
crescent-shaped bent plywood buoyed by a divider in a sine-wave
pattern. A gleaming giant toadstool of a table by Ferruccio Laviani
was made entirely of wood _ its base painted a '70s-era lacquer
white and the top waxed wenge wood. It will be carried by Salon
Moderne in Manhattan.
</P>
<P>
   The Hummel Award
</P>
<P>
   Part cute figurine, part Jeff Koons sculpture, Philippe Starck's
new small table was literally based on the iconic garden gnome. It
outraged some, flabbergasted others and had Claudio Luti, the
managing director of the Italian manufacturer Kartell, shaking his
head in disbelief that so many customers wanted to buy it
(including a new hotel in London).
</P>
<P>
   Starck, explained: ``Minimalism has become a retro '70s
fashion,'' he said. ``There's no life in it. Why not a little bomb?
We need humor and tenderness more than we need beautiful lines.''
</P>
<P>
   The Gummi Bear Award
</P>
<P>
   Gaetano Pesce brought a collection of lamps, tables and
children's chairs to Milan from his studio in Manhattan. Made of
resin, in jujube colors, they are shipped flat to be snapped
together. In typical Pesce style, each seat is etched with a jaunty
profile or cut-out clown's face. They will be available for under
$200 at Moss in New York in May. At 60, long an innovator of the
domestic landscape and Milan fairs, Pesce seemed the right choice
to predict the shape of things to come: ``Cheap and unique,'' he
said promptly, ``that's the future.''

   MILAN, Italy _ Wriggling derrieres replaced chattering into cell
phones as the signature gesture at the Milan furniture fair, the
world's premier showcase of forward-thinking design.
</P>
<P>
   Visitors did wriggle as fast as they could in the deflatable
Memo chair by Ron Arad of England while it transformed from squishy
beanbag to body-molded nest as the air was sucked out.
</P>
<P>
   They gyrated with hula-hooping ease in a tubular steel chair
with a hammock-sling seat by Achille Castiglioni, the octogenarian
modernist, and his collaborator, Ferruccio Laviani.
</P>
<P>
   And at B&AMP; B Italia, a jump-suited engineer was on hand to help
weaklings crank Antonio Citterio's Freetime chaise _ a recliner as
only a Milanese would interpret it, in swank wool cashmere.
</P>
<P>
   In a year with no big-bang design movements, with minimalism
still dominating 5 million square feet of exhibition space, with
some furniture factories only a dozen miles from the border with
the former Yugoslavia, and war on everyone's mind, unease pervaded
the 38th annual fair, which ended April 18. Furniture seemed to be
slouching toward the millennium. The search for relief was on.
</P>
<P>
   Buyers and manufacturers from 140 countries, along with magazine
editors in search of hip trends, were looking for high style and
technological wonder, to be sure, but also for balm for the urban
soul.
</P>
<P>
   ``Change is so fast, people can't compete with it,'' said
Sven-Anwar Bibi, 27, a Cologne designer in a trio called Kombinat.
The team christened its first installation _ or was it a manifesto?
_ ``Homesick.'' It was an elegantly monastic refuge of three
compartments: paneled walnut walls, with a single bed, desk and
bench as built-ins. ``The wood of our childhood,'' Bibi explained,
``to remind us of a time which is much slower than now. We need
that.'' Designed for a populace yearning for permanence _ furniture
without wheels is a good place to start _ the assertive immobility
of this modern cloister seemed to touch a nerve in the Satellite
pavilion, the fair's showcase for young innovators.
</P>
<P>
   Among the 162,555 attendees, a relatively sober mood prevailed
in spite of buoyant business. In Italy, new furniture sales
increased from $16.8 billion in 1997 to $18 billion in 1998 with
exports to the United States up by 3.3 percent to $972 million in
1998. (The United States is still the second largest customer,
after Germany.)
</P>
<P>
   The mild shock of seeing the young and avant-garde developing
high-concept furniture for slowing down was reinforced by Philips,
the mainstream Dutch electronics company, which displayed a House
of the Future with a distinctly nostalgic bent. ``Emotion
containers'' _ stainless steel cones that digitally capture the
image, voice and scent of beloved family members _ may soothe a
homesick 21st-century Willy Loman _ but why not simply give the
kids a good-night kiss?
</P>
<P>
   More useful, perhaps, was the Interactive Tablecloth made of
washable linen and woven with power circuits. It promised to supply
current for lights, appliances and warming plates without singeing
a fingertip. A Philips spokesman said the tablecloth could be
available within five years _ that is, unless it joins the ranks of
other obsolescence-bound improvements from yesterday's Houses of
Tomorrow.
</P>
<P>
   A testy appreciation for the past rippled through the fair, even
among the most technologically daring. ``The first day of the next
millennium is going to look a lot like the last day of this
millennium,'' Arad said. ``Televisions get slimmer and slimmer and
computers get more sophisticated, but tables and chairs and sofas
have stayed more or less the same. The modern chair peaked in the
1950s with Charles and Ray Eames, George Nelson, Arne Jacobsen, and
after that there was very little revolution.''
</P>
<P>
   Arad promptly overturned his own theory by supplying the fair
with some of its most challenging entries. A pair of vases made of
plastic resin and polymer wire were created with the latest design
technology, called rapid prototyping: ``I put my idea into a
computer, it's translated over the phone to Holland and delivered
here in finished form the next day,'' Arad explained.
</P>
<P>
   His Memo chair for Inflate Design Studio of London suggested
that if the times are not relaxing, people have at least relaxed
their idea of what a piece of furniture should look like. He spoke
of Memo, which is high-performance vinyl filled with polystyrene
balls, as ``infinitely adjustable.'' And it is _ so long as there's
a pump or vacuum cleaner.
</P>
<P>
   ``You have to stay quite rigidly in place for it to work,'' said
Matty J. Veldkamp, a visitor, as she tried to carve out room for
her elbows as the chair hardened around her. ``It's really quite an
effort.'' Ms. Veldkamp, a senior adviser at the Dutch Ministry of
Education, Culture and Science, also questioned whether a vacuum
cleaner was the right accessory for a stylish living room. (Decide
for yourself: the chair will be at Totem, the New York store, in
May, starting at $350.)

<P>
   Comical or innovative, trend-setting or eyebrow-raising, here
are some of the furnishings that provoked the most impassioned
comment over the morning caffe lattes and the midnight grappas.
</P>
<P>
   Sole of Wit
</P>
<P>
   Jasper Morrison, the London designer, looked inside his
girlfriend's Prada shoes for inspiration. His Low-Pad and High-Pad
chairs for Cappellini display a clipboard-thin profile with
cushions in bas-relief. The lightness and model-thin silhouette
clearly delighted this 39-year-old minimalist, but he quickly
added: ``You've got quite a lot of padding. I have a very bad back,
so it's become a major issue with me that the chair really has to
support in the right way.'' The chairs could well take airport
furniture to a higher level and will be sold through Cappellini and
Modern Age in New York, starting in May, at $554.
</P>
<P>
   The Mad Max Award
</P>
<P>
   A study in tactile dissonance, Hi Square, a sofa by Massimo
Morozzi for Edra, is ``the furniture equivalent of the Sex
Pistols,'' said Paola Antonelli, a design curator at the Museum of
Modern Art in New York. In a nod to trendy straw-bale houses _ or
to a nostalgic hayride? _ its milky translucent polyurethane
cushions are stuffed with a straw lookalike (actually, a flax
fiber). In high-fashion counterpoint, the padded neoprene frame is
a gleaming lacquer red. Buyers beware: Cushions may be sticky when
hot, so this may not be ideal for a miniskirt. The Dr. Scholl Award
</P>
<P>
   For its luminous blue-and-green transparency and squishability,
nothing beat Werner Aisslinger's Soft Cell gel-furniture,
upholstered with polyurethane used to pad bicycle saddles and
wheelchairs. No bed sores.
</P>
<P>
   The Techno-Hut Award
</P>
<P>
   New materials don't have to result in new forms. Hella
Jongerius, a Dutch designer who is now working on Donna Karan's
home collection, based her Kasese chair on one made of sticks she
found in a church in Uganda. ``It was poetry,'' she said, ``and it
made me think, ``Well, what is our poetry?' Can I translate this
for the '90s, in high-tech materials, into something you can
love?'' (It folds up, too.)
</P>
<P>
   She remade it in lightweight carbon, knitted and woven to look
like animal skin, and covered the seat in neoprene or a
dramatically folksy felt that looks like shaggy goat hide. Murray
Moss, the owner of the New York store Moss, saw it and said, ``It's
primitive yet highly informed, it's jarring, and yet you have to
smile.''
</P>
<P>
   The Great Reveal
</P>
<P>
   Cassina and Flexform were among the many companies
reinterpreting the ingenious tubular-steel experiments of the early
modern masters Le Corbusier, Charlotte Perriand and Marcel Breuer.
A graceful arc of tubing joins chunky leather back and low-slung
seat cushions in a new Flexform chair by Citterio. The seat slides
and the back tilts without shedding any James Bond cool. And the
Nest sofa by Piero Lissoni for Cassina exposes its frame, as pliant
at its corners as a line of ballerinas bending at the bar.
</P>
<P>
   The Not-Afraid-to-Flirt Award
</P>
<P>
   Emmemobili, an Italian furniture manufacturer, threw minimalism
a few welcome curves with an elegant wall shelf made of
crescent-shaped bent plywood buoyed by a divider in a sine-wave
pattern. A gleaming giant toadstool of a table by Ferruccio Laviani
was made entirely of wood _ its base painted a '70s-era lacquer
white and the top waxed wenge wood. It will be carried by Salon
Moderne in Manhattan.
</P>
<P>
   The Hummel Award
</P>
<P>
   Part cute figurine, part Jeff Koons sculpture, Philippe Starck's
new small table was literally based on the iconic garden gnome. It
outraged some, flabbergasted others and had Claudio Luti, the
managing director of the Italian manufacturer Kartell, shaking his
head in disbelief that so many customers wanted to buy it
(including a new hotel in London).
</P>
<P>
   Starck, explained: ``Minimalism has become a retro '70s
fashion,'' he said. ``There's no life in it. Why not a little bomb?
We need humor and tenderness more than we need beautiful lines.''
</P>
<P>
   The Gummi Bear Award
</P>
<P>
   Gaetano Pesce brought a collection of lamps, tables and
children's chairs to Milan from his studio in Manhattan. Made of
resin, in jujube colors, they are shipped flat to be snapped
together. In typical Pesce style, each seat is etched with a jaunty
profile or cut-out clown's face. They will be available for under
$200 at Moss in New York in May. At 60, long an innovator of the
domestic landscape and Milan fairs, Pesce seemed the right choice
to predict the shape of things to come: ``Cheap and unique,'' he
said promptly, ``that's the future.''

A DAY WITHOUT GAS? WHY NOT A WEEK?
</HEADLINE>
  (For release Thursday, April 29)  
(mk) 
 By SUSAN SWARTZ   
 Santa Rosa (Calif.) Press Democrat   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   A commuter to San Francisco declared she'd sooner run out of gas
on the Golden Gate Bridge than stop at the gas station in Marin
that was charging over $2 a gallon last week. We snorted in
agreement. It's a self-immolating notion, but understandable in
these times.
</P>
<P>
   Tell Americans they're going to pay more for gasoline and they
go off faster than a Lexus. It's one of the few consumer protests
we can get behind. They can't get away with hiking prices like
that, no matter what the reason. Here we are spending more on car
payments than our parents paid for their houses. We can't be
expected to go another 43 cents a gallon.
</P>
<P>
   For weeks the Internet has been hopping with e-mail exhortations
to join an April 30 protest, a day no one buys gas and we make a
collective face at the oil companies.
</P>
<P>
   Boy, will we show them. Of course, we'll be hurting a lot of
people whose jobs have been reduced to selling cigarettes and
passing out bathroom keys, who have to pay the same price for gas
to drive to work that the rest of us do, but who are they?
</P>
<P>
   My personal favorite gas station is permanently closed, because
of environmental regulations having to do with underground tanks. I
would have had a hard time snubbing those guys because they took
care of all the cars in our family. You could drive in and say ``Do
these tires look soft?'' and someone would wipe his hands on his
dark blue pants, pull out his tire checker and reassure you they
were fine. No charge. On stormy days they'd sometimes wave you back
in your car even if you were at the self-serve pump. Since they're
gone I go to places where you pump it yourself, pay for it outside
and worry about your own oil. The people who work there are
faceless.
</P>
<P>
   I guess I could boycott them and not feel guilty but I doubt
they have any more influence on OPEC than I do.
</P>
<P>
   I hate the idea of any business upping their prices just because
they can get away with it, although that seems to be the way with
everything from blue jeans to airline tickets, but I'm not a
student of pump prices. Until this latest hike hit the frenzy mark
I didn't really notice what I paid. I also didn't realize, until I
just read it, that last December gasoline was a deal at $1.16 in
Northern California _ less than we'd paid for five years. I don't
remember the celebrations back then.
</P>
<P>
   It depends on your priority. Some of us will drive extra miles
to save a bit on white meat canned tuna but when it comes to gas
it's who's closest when you're empty.
</P>
<P>
   If we're going to get agitated about the cost of gasoline, why
not resent how much it costs to drive, period? What about the price
of new tires and car insurance? How about the cost of parking and
parking tickets? The price of a car phone, infant seat, sun roof,
security system and real leather seats.
</P>
<P>
   Driving a car is no bargain. It's a luxury, yet when it comes to
gasoline we act as if it's a public utility, like heating fuel and
drinking water.
</P>
<P>
   I'd rather protest the sorry lack of good food along the freeway
than gas prices.
</P>
<P>
   Or how about the car addiction we pass on to high school kids so
that most teen-agers now depend on a car to get to work for the job
they need to pay for a car?
</P>
<P>
   We Americans are said to have a love affair with our cars, but
they sure make us grumpy. It's no surprise that people are foaming
at the mouth over gas prices. We're at our most ferocious when
we're in our cars. And we're always in our cars.
</P>
<P>
   We've accepted road rage as a cultural trait, rather than as
something we might want to control. Reasonable people become
maniacs behind the wheel, cursing at strangers, muttering to
themselves, shutting the world out with loud music and flipping off
those who don't like it. We are annoyed by red lights, stop signs
and drivers who don't turn into oncoming traffic when we think they
should.
</P>
<P>
   Most of us are snobs about public transportation. We'll visit a
new city and master its metro but refuse to even try to take the
bus in our own town.
</P>
<P>
   Back to the protest. What is a single day going to achieve? The
protest organizers predict that if no one buys gas on April 30, the
prices will drop drastically. I don't believe that.
</P>
<P>
   Big Oil could handle one day without us, because they know we'll
be thirsty the day after.
</P>
<P>
   How about if we went a week without gassing up?
</P>
<P>
   If we had to make a tank of gas last a week, or even longer, we
would have to get smart and budget our car use. We'd have to share,
plan, car pool, walk, try out the bus. We might even start to think
how nice it would be to have a train as an alternative.
</P>
<P>
   Now, that would show them.

   With its sleek silver back and glowing red underbelly and
taillight, the Microsoft Intellimouse Explorer, which will become
available in September, is the most visually striking computer
mouse yet.
</P>
<P>
   But the most impressive feature about the mouse, which is
expected to cost $74.95, is that Microsoft removed almost all the
interior moving parts, including the mouse ball. Instead, the new
mouse, which is about the same size as other such devices, uses an
optical sensor and a digital signal processing (DSP) chip to track
minute movements over virtually any surface except glass.
</P>
<P>
   The camera snaps some 1,500 tiny images each second; the chip,
using a process called image correlation processing, compares
images to see what has changed, then translates the changes into
coordinates that show how the mouse has moved.
</P>
<P>
   The mouse is more fluid and precise than with an old-fashioned
``ball'' mouse and better even than the earlier optical mice that
required a special optical mouse pad. And because there is no mouse
ball to roll lint, dust or cookie crumbs into the device's belly
button, it is fastidiously clean.
</P>
<P>
   There are also two new buttons, controlled by the thumb,
designed specifically for clicking forward and backward through
pages of a Web sites and a scroll wheel for Net applications.
</P>
<P>
   The new Microsoft mouse is designed for right-handers, and it
works only with computers with Windows, so it's hard cheese for
left-handed Macintosh or Linux users who have glass-topped desks.
</P>

   Linux's Popular Creator Steals the Show From Gates  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   At the annual Comdex-Windows World conference this week, William
Gates, the Microsoft chairman, standing with an eight-foot high
model of the new optical mouse, attracted the usual overflow crowd
for his opening day keynote speech. But the real star of the
conference was not the head of Microsoft, but a lone programmer who
gives away his work: Linus Torvalds.
</P>
<P>
   Torvalds, the creator of the Linux operating system and current
darling of the technologically hip, was scheduled to give the
keynote address for a conference-within-a-conference called the
Linux Pavilion. The original venue was a small conference room that
would hold about 100 people.
</P>
<P>
   When a line started forming two hours early, the event was moved
to a larger room that would hold about 500 people. Even that wasn't
big enough. The crowd, estimated at about 1,500, filled the room
and spilled out into the halls.
</P>
<P>
   While Torvalds didn't disappoint them, he did seem a little
stunned by the enthusiasm, including a standing ovation at the end.
Someone asked if he had nightmares about security issues
surrounding Linux.
</P>
<P>
   ``No, but I think that users should have nightmares about
trusting their software security to the control of a single
vendor,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Torvalds is convinced that Linux will continue to grow in
popularity, but he warned the faithful, ``Don't get caught up in
the hype.'' Judging from the reaction to his appearance, it may
already be too late for that. &QL;

   Next-Generation Game Player Is on the Way From Sega
</P>
<P>
   In the video-game universe, most of the hottest action has
migrated from consoles to CD-ROMs in recent years. No more,
promises Sega of America, an arm of Sega Enterprises, based in
Tokyo. On Sept. 9 the company will release in &QL; 
the United States the Sega Dreamcast machine, one of the most
highly anticipated home video game players in years, Dave Karraker,
a Sega spokesman, said this week.
</P>
<P>
   Dreamcast will have 128-bit architecture and will be 15 times as
powerful as Sony Playstation and 10 times as powerful as Nintendo
64; it will &QL; 
have four times the graphics-processing power of even the fastest
Pentium II chip, Karraker said. And it will cost only $199, well
below what next-generation game machines usually cost when they are
introduced. But don't look to play your old Sega games on it; a
whole new generation of games are in the works for it.
</P>
<P>
   But its pre-eminence in the highly competitive video game domain
is not assured for long. Sony is expected to release its own
next-generation machine, an even faster and more powerful machine
(at least on paper) than Dreamcast, early next year.
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
   Palm Pilot May Be Powerful, But That Screen Is Fragile
</P>
<P>
   Unlike your PC, when Palm Pilots crash, they really crash.
According to a representative in Palm Computing's repair
information department, the most common complaint _ an estimated 90
percent of the calls _ are from users with cracked or broken glass
screens that have rendered the units inoperable.
</P>
<P>
   So what happens when your Pilot takes a swan dive onto the
unforgiving floor? You call up Palm Computing to report it. If the
problem is obviously screen damage, they will _ for $100 _ send
right out to you, via Airborne Express, a reconditioned Pilot of
the same model.
</P>
<P>
   The screen on your old Pilot is then replaced and sent to the
next person on the broken-glass repair list. While you don't get
your original unit back, you can restore your personal data by
synching the handheld device to the Palm data port on your desktop
computer.
</P>
<P>
   For more information or to report a broken screen, call (888)
956-7256. Please write this number down, but not in your Pilot.

   A Program That Can Remove Advertising on Internet Pages  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A German electronics company is tackling those banner
advertisements with a product that strips most advertising off Web
pages. Web Washer was developed by engineers at Siemens AG who
wanted to get rid of advertising they thought was obtrusive. During
testing on the company's intranet, they discovered that it also
reduced the time pages took to load in a browser. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The software sits on a user's computer and waits for a user to
click on a link. Web Washer looks at all the pieces of what is
being requested and if anything looks as if it might be an ad, the
program will toss out that part of the request. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Roland Cuny, the Siemens engineer who came up with the idea for
Web Washer, said the program could filter out ``any kind of
undesired information, like over-designed background images on
Internet-intranet pages, ad banners, graphics, frames, Java
scripts, Java applets and pop-up windows'' and could be tuned by
the user to be more _ or less _ restrictive.  &QL;

   Great Art for Your Page? You Can Get It From Gates
</P>
<P>
   For nearly a decade, Bill Gates' other company, the Corbis Corp.
in Seattle (www.corbis.com), has been quietly acquiring the
electronic reproduction rights to 25 million images, including some
of the world's great art and historical photographs, like Monet's
``Poplars,'' Ansel Adams' ``Moonrise Over Hernandez,'' John F.
Kennedy Jr.'s salute at his father's funeral and the Challenger
explosion.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier this week, Corbis, a privately held company that is
wholly owned by Gates, announced that it was now selling nearly
400,000 of its images to individuals for one-time personal use.
Corbis, which already sells its images for commercial use, has
dubbed the new service the Corbis Picture Experience. The company
will let customers choose from 500,000 images to send free
electronic postcards.
</P>
<P>
   Each image will cost $3, which could change, depending on how
that price is accepted by consumers, said Steve Davis, president of
Corbis. The purchase of the images works through Qpass, a service
for online purchases.
</P>
<P>
   In a survey conducted by Corbis, 61 percent of personal Web site
builders said they planned to use Corbis images in their Web sites
in the next two years. The images may also be used for personal
newsletters, classroom reports, computer wallpaper and screen
savers.
</P>
<P>
   Davis said Corbis' move to sell images to consumers was in
keeping with what he describes as Gates' initial vision for Corbis:
putting great images on individual desktop computers. ``That was
part of his vision, to make historical images available for
personal use,'' Davis said.

   Robot Olympics? Live on the Net
</P>
<P>
   Will robots one day rule the world? Probably not, but they may
have taken over recess for a day. On Friday and Saturday, NASA will
broadcast this year's finals of the National Robotics Competition
live over the Internet (quest.arc.nasa.gov/firstrobots). The event
pits robots built by high-school students against one another in
tests of strength and skill. .  &QL;

   NATIONAL FORECAST
</P>
<P>
   Flooding rains and severe thunderstorms will menace parts of the
Middle West Thursday as a major spring storm system continues to
evolve Thursday and throughout the evening. Rather than striking
with a single offensive of stormy weather, the system will mount
several assaults as a series of potent jet stream disturbances
eject eastward from the main upper-level low pressure area hovering
over the Rockies.
</P>
<P>
   Early Thursday, a cluster of showers and thunderstorms will
produce heavy rains from northeast Kansas and northwest Missouri.
Storms will then move east-northeast into Iowa, northern Illinois
and southern Wisconsin. Rainfalls will likely exceed an inch.
</P>
<P>
   Another batch of showers and thunderstorms will erupt Thursday
afternoon over parts of eastern Kansas, eastern Oklahoma and
northeast Texas along a boundary that separates dry air from the
plateaus of Old Mexico and humid air from the Gulf of Mexico. A few
of these storms will approach severe levels, with isolated
tornadoes probable. Very warm air at 5,000 feet over southeast
Texas will act as a lid, likely prohibiting the development of
strong thunderstorms.
</P>
<P>
   A snowstorm will likely occur along the Front Range of the
Colorado and Wyoming Rockies as moist winds from the east are
forced to ascend the sloping terrain. Though the two jet stream
disturbances to the east and south of the region will likely
intercept a large portion of the moist plume of humid air flowing
north from the Gulf of Mexico, there will still be sufficient
moisture to produce 6 to 12 inches of snow in some spots.
</P>
<P>
   Focus: Dry Florida
</P>
<P>
   Wednesday morning the mercury stood at 50 degrees, a record
minimum, in Orlando, Florida. Less than a week ago, the middle of
the state had record maximums between 95 and 100 degrees. The usual
maritime climate of Florida has become more continental after a
serious winter drought. In fact, the relative humidity on Wednesday
afternoon was at desert levels, near 25 percent, in northeast
Florida. This shift to arid weather has led to numerous brush fires
that have burned more than 155,000 acres in the Everglades so far
this season. A few showers may dampen the southeast sections
Thursday. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Extended Forecast Text for Thursday, April 22 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Saturday, Sunday: Warmer, sunny weather will prevail across much
of the West as high pressure dominates the region. A low pressure
system in the southern Rockies will create mountain snows and
valley rain showers. Milder air will surge ahead of a cold front
moving into the Upper Middle West. The Northeast will be cool and
damp to start. Meanwhile, thunderstorms may erupt in the Southeast
as much of the South stays warm and humid. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Monday, Tuesday: A potent storm will cause wet and very cool
weather across much of the Great Lakes and Northeast. A cold front
extending from the low pressure will press across the Southeast
leaving all but Florida with cooler weather. Meanwhile, quieter
conditions will prevail in the Plains as a large high pressure area
settles in the region. Unseasonably warm and sunny weather will
spread northward through the Rocky Mountains. &QL;

<P>
   ROME _ A broad swath of the center of Rome is being dug up on a
site that archaeologists describe as the largest excavations
anywhere and that city officials say will one day become the
world's biggest outdoor archaeological museum.
</P>
<P>
   The excavation, which will cost about $11 million, began last
April and employs more than 100 workers, from archaeologists to
simple hod carriers, in an area covering 150,000 square feet. So
far they have brought to light bits of evidence and artifacts that
have added substantially to the previous knowledge of an area of
central Rome that for centuries has been its commercial and
political heart.
</P>
<P>
   The excavations are part of a broader project that when
completed will fundamentally change the shape of central Rome by
revamping one of the foremost urban renewal projects of the
century. From 1932 to 1934, Mussolini ordered the first major
excavations on the site when he constructed the broad Via dei Fori
Imperiali, then presumptuously known as the Via del Impero. His
idea was to connect the Colosseum with his offices at Piazza
Venezia and lay bare the remains of ancient Rome, whose glory he
sought unsuccessfully to recreate.
</P>
<P>
   When the current work is completed, sometime after 2001, the
excavated sites will form part of an enormous archaeological park
with marked paths, benches and visitor information centers. The Via
dei Fori Imperiali, which Mussolini intended for military parades,
will be substantially narrowed and limited to buses and other forms
of public transport.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's extraordinary, both from an archaeological and an urban
planning point of view,'' said Andreas M. Steiner, editor of the
Italian archaeological journal Archeo.
</P>
<P>
   The idea for a vast open-air archaeological park on the site of
these great Roman forums (which lie adjacent to the well-known
Roman Forum) has been under discussion for decades. But traffic and
urban planners objected to closing the Via dei Fori Imperiali to
private transportation and argued for preserving the avenue as a
rare example of monumental fascist-era urban design.
</P>
<P>
   Rome Mayor Francesco Rutelli, who wants to restore the city's
historic center to pedestrians, said the project would transform
the area ``from a scenic highway through the ruins to a kind of
balcony on the most extensive archaeological area in the world.''
</P>
<P>
   It remains controversial. ``People said it was useless to
excavate the forums, that we know everything,'' said Eugenio La
Rocca, an archaeologist who is the city's superintendent for
antiquities and fine arts.
</P>
<P>
   The digging is nevertheless progressing, focusing on three broad
areas that Mussolini's planners had leveled and planted with grass
and trees: the Forum of Caesar, dedicated by Julius Caesar in 46
B.C.; the Forum of Peace, built by the Emperor Vespasian from A.D.
71 to 75 after the destruction of Jerusalem, and Trajan's Forum,
begun in A.D. 107 by the Emperor Trajan and completed by his
successor, Hadrian. The finds, though modest, are casting light not
only on the area's early history but on its development in the
Middle Ages and the Renaissance as well.
</P>
<P>
   In Trajan's Forum, for instance, the digging has raised
questions about earlier attempts to reconstruct the complex: it had
been thought to consist of a large courtyard, with the monumental
Column of Trajan rising between a basilica, or meeting hall, and a
temple to the deified emperor. But Silvana Rizzo, the chief
archaeologist, said that borings on the temple's presumed site
yielded no evidence of a building. ``Was it the area around the
column that was designated as a temple,'' she said, ``or was it the
entire sacred area, in the sense of an open-air temple?''
</P>
<P>
   Nor have archaeologists been able to find the base of the
immense equestrian statue of Trajan that written sources describe
as having stood at the forum's center.
</P>
<P>
   In the nearby forum of the Emperor Nerva, completed in A.D. 97,
the discovery of a relief figure of a woman believed to be an
allegorical representation of a Roman province has changed
archaeologists' views about the forum's original decoration, and
has cast into doubt the identification of another long-known figure
(also in the Nerva Forum) as the goddess Minerva. ``It's probably
not Minerva at all,'' said La Rocca, ``but one of a series of Roman
provinces.''
</P>
<P>
   Among the Renaissance-era finds, archaeologists digging in
Trajan's Forum recently unearthed the well-preserved workshop of a
16th-century Renaissance potter, complete with kiln, pottery
remains and a storehouse of clay and tools. Comparisons of the
pottery with archival records enabled scholars to identify the
potter as Giovannino Boni da Brescia, whose work had been known to
experts but whose workshop shop site had never been identified.
</P>
<P>
   Restoration of stonework that once formed the back wall of the
Temple of Mars Ultor, constructed by the Emperor Augustus for his
forum, is helping experts determine not only the roof line of the
original temple, now a ruin, but also that of medieval buildings
constructed on the site after the temple had fallen victim to time.
</P>
<P>
   The discoveries have set off a debate about just what remains
are worthy of preservation. In a process much like peeling the skin
of an onion, Roman archaeology yields traces of successive ages
from antiquity to the present. For Mussolini, whose interest was in
finding evidence of the glory of imperial Rome, the remains of
later ages had little interest, and he regularly ordered them
destroyed.
</P>
<P>
   Today, experts attach the same importance to the remains of the
Middle Ages and Renaissance that they do to ancient ruins. So in
Nerva's Forum, for instance, the remains of ninth-century
Carolingian buildings have been left standing where they were built
even though their presence prevents a partial restoration of the
earlier forum.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a real problem,'' La Rocca acknowledged.
</P>
<P>
   Next fall the digging will be interrupted and temporary walkways
constructed to allow pilgrims streaming to Rome to celebrate the
third millennium of Christianity to pass the Colosseum and Trajan's
Column on their way to St. Peter's and the Vatican.
</P>
<P>
   In January 2001 the digging will recommence, and the park will
be given what city officials hope will be the park's final look.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've reawakened Roman archaeology,'' said La Rocca, ``which
had been slumbering for quite a few years.''

TIPS ON CAR SEATS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By CAROLYN POIROT 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Are we a nation of stupid, uncaring parents?
</P>
<P>
   It seems that way when you consider these statistics:
</P>
<P>
   The National Traffic Safety Administration estimates that 70
percent to 80 percent of child-restraint systems are incorrectly
installed or improperly used.
</P>
<P>
   Many of us let our children roam the back seat unrestrained
while the car is moving.
</P>
<P>
   Car accidents are the No. 1 killer of children ages 5 to 15.
</P>
<P>
   If all child restraints were installed and used properly and
consistently, 71 percent of children killed in motor-vehicle
crashes could be saved, experts say.
</P>
<P>
   ``Riding in a car is the most dangerous thing we do with our
kids on a daily basis,'' says Ann Athey, former director of
advocacy for Cook Children's Medical Center in Fort Worth and the
Safe Kids Coalition of Tarrant County. Seventy-five percent of
motor vehicle crashes occur within 25 miles of home; 60 percent
occur on roads with speed limits of 40 mph or less.
</P>
<P>
   ``The biggest problem I see is what to do with the older
child,'' Athey says. ``The prevailing attitude is, the child can
come out of a car seat once he outgrows his forward-facing
convertible seat, at about the age of 4.''
</P>
<P>
   But most kids at 40 pounds won't fit correctly into seat belts
without a booster (the shoulder belt should fit across the
collarbone, not the neck or face). Putting the shoulder belt behind
the child or under the arm is NOT a good solution; it could cause
serious internal injury during a crash. A booster for older
children won't boost their ``cool'' quotient, but it could save
their lives. Now, that seems more than worth a little whining.
</P>
<P>
   REVAMPING VEHICLES
</P>
<P>
   All new motor vehicles must be equipped with standardized
child-restraint anchorage systems, effective Sept. 1.
</P>
<P>
   Under the government regulation, all new cars and trucks will
have standard anchors built into their back seats, and all new
child-safety seats will have three standard attachments, one on top
and two at the base, that link directly into the anchors.
</P>
<P>
   The new anchorage system is designed to be easy to use and
independent of vehicle seat belts. It is in accord with European,
Canadian and Australian regulations, which assure that all
child-restraint seats can be properly hooked up in all motor
vehicles.
</P>
<P>
   IT'S THE LAW
</P>
<P>
   Texas law requires that a child younger than 2 be restrained in
a federally approved safety seat when riding in a motor vehicle.
Children 2 to 4 must wear a seat belt or be strapped in a safety
seat.
</P>
<P>
   For anyone older than 4, seat belts are required only in the
front seat. However, safety advocates say that everyone in the car
should be properly restrained in a car seat, booster seat or seat
belt.
</P>
<P>
   State Sen. Mike Moncrief of Fort Worth has a bill before the
Texas Legislature that would require all children under 15 to
buckle up, no matter where they are riding (front or back).
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. Department of Transportation's panel to improve
child-passenger safety says all states should require children
younger than 4 to be in a child-safety seat, and older children up
to age 16 be in either a properly adjusted seat belt or a booster
seat.

17 elections for prime minister and parliament. The Russians a re a
complex group, highly educated, cultured, and secular. In Ashkelon,
they have several Russian newspapers, their own political
leadership and butchers who flout kosher laws against pork
products. Coming from the largest country in the world, they are
apprehensive about turning over any of tiny Israel to the Arabs and
that's why, in 1996, two-thirds voted for Benjamin Netanyahu. But

   SCHOOL-CHOICE _ The 40,000 tuition grants being given nationally
to poor kids to opt out of public schools is a lot like an
initiative in Atlanta begun in 1992. We'll focus on a mother and
two daughters who received these scholarships and talk about that
parents in this program, while they appreciate it, didn't use it to
get a vastly better education, used it instead to get a very
religious education at unaccredited schools. So if this scholarship
program is to show that we should have tax-funded vouchers, the
move to religious school raises constitutional problems with mixing
church and state and changes the very nature of public education
from a public good to a private commodity. (Cumming, Atlanta
Journal-Constitution). 25.

Consumers League shows one easy way people can save money and help
the Earth: Buy 10 common things, like soft drinks, cereal and
pasta, in the least massive containers (i.e. cereal in bags instead
of boxes). Waste reduction promises to hit home even harder, as
cities go to various pay-as-you-throw schemes, which charge
homeowners based on the amount of garbage they produce. (Atlanta

   We all harbor secret ambitions, and often they're of the
exploits we're least likely to be able to achieve. People with tin
ears fantasize that they can sing like Caruso or play like
Horowitz.
</P>
<P>
   The RCA Corp. once thought it had figured out how to turn such
human yearnings into a profitable business. In 1929, it tried to
exploit the fantasies of closet musicians by selling a musical
instrument that could supposedly turn the masses into maestros.
</P>
<P>
   ``Anyone can make exquisitely beautiful music with nothing but
his own two hands!'' crowed the advertising copy for the
instrument, called a theremin, the only one that is played without
touching any part of it. It is ``destined to be the universal
musical instrument,'' the advertisements said, and people will play
it as easily ``as they now write or walk.''
</P>
<P>
   The reality was, and is, that the theremin, the granddaddy of
all electronic musical instruments, is considered by many of its
enthusiasts to be the world's most difficult instrument to play.
RCA found out the hard way; it sold just 485 of them, which each
cost $175 (more than $1,500 in 1999 dollars).
</P>
<P>
   But that wasn't the end for the theremin, which uses simple
electronic principles to produce a somewhat eerie sound, a cross
between an amplified child's slide whistle, a human voice and the
squawks that emanated from early radio speakers.
</P>
<P>
   If you have listened to the Beach Boys' hit ``Good Vibrations,''
you've heard a theremin riff. The theremin was used to produce the
otherworldly music in '40s and '50s films like ``Spellbound,''
``The Lost Weekend'' and ``The Day the Earth Stood Still.''
</P>
<P>
   Today, enthusiasts gather at conferences and on the Web (a
starting point is www.nashville.net/theremin) to trade experiences
and tips.
</P>
<P>
   ``he creation of the theremin was a seminal moment, the primal
scream of the beginning of electronic music,''said Albert Glinsky,
an associate professor of music at Mercyhurst College in Erie, Pa.,
who is the author of the forthcoming book, ``Out Of Thin Air''
(University of Illinois Press), a history of the instrument and its
extraordinary inventor, Lev Sergeyevich Termen, a name later
Anglicized to Leon Theremin.
</P>
<P>
   The classic theremin looks much like a portable lectern with two
antennas sticking out. Early audiences often thought the whole
thing a hoax.
</P>
<P>
   Theremin discovered the principles behind the instrument when
working as a researcher in 1920 in Leningrad. He moved to the
United States in 1927, then went back to the Soviet Union in 1938.
</P>
<P>
   Rumor has it that he was kidnapped by the KGB (he was sent to a
Siberian labor camp for three months). While saving the details for
his book, Glinsky said the circumstances were actually more complex
than that. The inventor remained under house arrest until 1947,
when he was secretly awarded the Stalin Prize for inventing the
Soviet Union's first electronic eavesdropping device.
</P>
<P>
   The sound of the theremin is controlled by moving one's hands
close to two antennas set into the box: The vertical antenna
controls the pitch, while a horizontal loop antenna affects the
volume. The theremin is so difficult to play because there are no
visual or physical cues to indicate when you are hitting the right
note.
</P>
<P>
   With the theremin, the player has no idea exactly what note will
come out; while modern instruments can produce sounds across a
range of five to six octaves, moving the hand as little as
one-sixteenth of an inch can change the note by a half-step in some
models.
</P>
<P>
   The technique most players use is to start to play a note at a
very low volume and then to ``rim'' it quickly, either up or down,
to reach the exact pitch. Only then is the volume raised. Staccato
sounds, or separated notes, are created by moving the left hand
toward the horizontal volume antenna to stop the sound, then moving
the right hand to the proper distance from the vertical pitch
antenna before raising the volume again.
</P>
<P>
   Interest in the instrument is growing. Robert Moog, inventor of
the first electronic synthesizer and a theremin enthusiast, has
sold more than 4,000 theremins since his company, Big Briar, opened
its doors five years ago. Theremins are also available from
Wavefront Technologies in Los Angeles.
</P>
<P>
   The definitive theremin recordings are by Clara Rockmore, a
Russian immigrant and protege of Theremin's. ``To play like Clara
Rockmore is impossible,'' said Alex Schub, a musician from Los
Angeles who recently performed on the theremin with the Los Angeles
Philharmonic. ``She played the theremin like a violinist, and
nobody else can do that.''

 &HT;    OFFICIALS PRAY, PONDER HOW TO CUT SCHOOL VIOLENCE
 &HT;    Eds: Updates in 7th graf with Reno visit planned.
 &HT;    480&AMP;add.

<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ From the White House to Congress, federal officials
struggled Wednesday to express national sorrow for the mass
violence in Littleton, Colo., and to start yet another search for
ways to increase safety in schools.
</P>
<P>
   Moments of silent prayer, meditation and condolences to the
families of the victims were led in the White House by President
Clinton and on the House floor by Speaker Dennis Hastert, R-Ill.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is a deep desire to comfort the grieving and counsel
with children,''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton said.
</P>
<P>
   Hastert, a former high school teacher and wrestling coach, had a
message for the parents of students at Columbine High School: ``As
a parent of two boys, I can only imagine the grief you are feeling
today as you try to make sense of yesterday's tragic events.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton said, ``It is very important to explain to children all
over America what has happened and to reassure our own children
that they are safe (and) to hammer home to all the children of
America that violence is wrong.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton said agents from the Federal Bureau of Investigation and
the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms were already assisting
local law enforcement authorities. School and community leaders
were offered help from grief counselors and other post-crisis
consultants at a federally supported center in Denver.
</P>
<P>
   He also cleared his schedule for Thursday, in case state and
local officials request a visit by him. A visit was planned by
Attorney General Janet Reno, who along with Education Secretary
Richard Riley last August mailed a security manual to every one of
the nation's more than 100,000 public and private schools.
</P>
<P>
   Riley said the decision not to visit Littleton on Wednesday was
reached during late-night consultations between officials of
several departments.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it's a mistake for people like me to go soaring in
while the local people are trying to sort out the tragedy,'' Riley
said.
</P>
<P>
   Responding to requests from ``many'' senators, Chairman Jim
Jeffords, R-Vt., announced that his Senate Committee on Health,
Education, Labor and Pensions would hold hearings on school
violence in May.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Edward Kennedy, D-Mass., said the ``terrible tragedy in the
heart of the nation'' might lead to new gun control and gun safety
laws.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have 14 children die every single day from gun violence''
outside schools, Kennedy said. ``But none of us here is coming up
with a silver bullet to solve all of those problems.''
</P>
<P>
   Sen. John Ashcroft, R-Mo., said Congress and society should find
a way to counter ``a culture of violence'' that includes
literature, gangsta rap and video games.
</P>
<P>
   ``These aren't things government can have much to do with,'' he
said. But he said that parents should realize that ``disrespect for
life'' can grow out of video games in which a child ``may punch out
an opponent on a machine _ kill, kill, kill _ just by punching a
button on a computer.''
</P>
<P>
   (Story can end here. Optional add follows)
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Jeff Bingaman, D-N.M., said the Littleton violence might
increase the chances of approval of his bill requiring the Justice
Department to spend $2 million setting up a new School Security
Center at Sandia National Laboratories in his home state and giving
schools $30 million over three years to buy technology recommended
by the center.
</P>
<P>
   ``For example, by installing cameras, schools could be
forewarned of problems, and law enforcement can use those cameras
in situations like the hostage situation that occurred in
Colorado,'' Bingaman said.
</P>
<P>
   By coincidence, Wednesday was the day on which the House and
Senate overwhelmingly approved a compromise version of this year's
first education bill, which Clinton has agreed to sign.
</P>
<P>
   One short clause in the Educational Flexibility bill, which
gives schools more flexibility in spending federal funds, will make
it easier for school officials to expel a student who possesses a
gun on school property.
</P>
<P>
   Previously, some students wiggled out of expulsion by arguing
that mere possession of a gun that they might have discovered
inside a school did not prove that they had violated the federal
ban on bringing a gun onto school property.

`MORGAN': THE FACTS DON'T SUPPORT THE IMAGE 
</HEADLINE>
   (editors: publication notes at end of review)  
 (bl)  
 By CHRISTOPHER LEHMANN-HAUPT   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   In the introduction to her authoritative new biography of John
Pierpont Morgan (1837-1913), Jean Strouse makes a startling
confession about her experience in writing ``Morgan: American
Financier,'' her first book since ``Alice James: A Biography'' was
published in 1980.
</P>
<P>
   Having spent years availing herself of a virtually untouched
trove of uncatalogued biographical documents in the Pierpont Morgan
Library in New York, as well as additional material in private
hands, at the Morgan Grenfell archives in London and other
repositories on both sides of the Atlantic, she eventually began to
write and got about halfway through a draft when she saw that it
wasn't working.
</P>
<P>
   She explains: ``Months later I realized why. From the outset I
had found Morgan's detractors more convincing than his champions:
they were better writers, they reflected popular American
assumptions (including my own) about the `robber baron' chapter of
our history, and their bracing hostility gave the story force. The
advocates, by comparison, seemed defensive and fawning. As a
result, I had been looking for a modified, human-scale version of
the `boss croupier' of Wall Street _ the cynical tycoon who
subjected the entire U.S. economy'' to what E.L. Doctorow, writing
about Morgan in his novel ``Ragtime,'' referred to as ``the
psychopathology of his will.''
</P>
<P>
   But ``this was not what I had found,'' she writes. ``The
evidence didn't support the picture I had pre-emptively drawn, and
I hadn't been noticing what it did suggest.''
</P>
<P>
   What adjustments did Ms. Strouse then make that have permitted
her to write a book that does indeed work in offering a coherent
portrait of Morgan? One set of revelations has to do with his
personality. Popular iconography has given us an image of Morgan
that is brusque, arrogant, unapproachable, imperious and
overwhelming in its force. While Ms. Strouse confirms this side of
him, she also shows us a man who was mercurial; given to depression
and nervous exhaustion; possessed of what one friend called ``a
very feminine streak in his nature''; flirtatious; vulnerable to
flattery, and occasionally so sensitive to criticism that some felt
that his appearance in 1912 before a House Banking and Currency
subcommittee trying to establish the existence of a ruling ``money
trust'' helped bring on his terminal illness.
</P>
<P>
   Another dimension of Ms. Strouse's portrait reveals more about
Morgan as a great collector of art. His image here, too, has not
always been flattering. The connoisseur Bernard Berenson once
remarked of Morgan's London house, ``It looks like a pawnbroker's
shop for Croesuses.'' The critic Roger Fry delivered a summary
judgment that, in the author's words, ``has defined Morgan as
collector for generations of scholars and readers: `A crude
historical imagination,' the critic wrote, `was the only flaw in
his otherwise perfect insensibility (to art).'''
</P>
<P>
   As a corrective to these remarks, Ms. Strouse reveals a man
whose sensuous nature was deeply attracted to art, who put himself
in the hands of experts and whose ``larger project'' was ``to
harvest `the best' of the world's cultural past for the American
future.''
</P>
<P>
   But it is of Morgan as a financier that Ms. Strouse offers the
most profound revision. His eloquent detractors have portrayed him
as a ``great financial Gorgon'' set on squeezing to death the
farmer and the working man for the sake of his own profit. But
while conceding he was ``tone-deaf to the sensitivities of people
whose interests did not coincide with his own,'' she argues that in
his own mind at least, his interests were always identical to
whatever would benefit the public.
</P>
<P>
   His motive for organizing trusts was not to monopolize products
but to organize markets more efficiently for the sake of everyone's
profit. His bank's manipulations during panics were consistently
meant to stabilize the market, no matter how profitable they might
prove (and often enough they didn't). His defense of the gold
standard was as much to sustain the flow of European capital into
America as it was to protect his own interests.
</P>
<P>
   In sum, Ms. Strouse writes: ``When Pierpont Morgan died in 1913,
at 75, he was the most powerful banker in the world. He had
organized giant railroad systems and corporate `trusts,' presided
over a massive transfer of wealth from Europe to the United States,
and, at a time when America had no central bank, acted as a monitor
of its capital markets and lender of last resort. In the process he
helped transform a largely agrarian society into a modern
industrial state _ and entered into a struggle over the nature of
the country's identity that dates back to Jefferson and Hamilton.''
</P>
<P>
   Woven together, Ms. Strouse's revelations tell a story whose
interest is only limited by the inherent dryness of banking as an
activity. After all, what Morgan essentially did when he wasn't
abroad buying art and seducing women was simply to judge financial
opportunities, raise money and issue bonds. Even his philanthropy,
while heroic, was straightforward.
</P>
<P>
   As authoritative as her text is, her footnotes extend her reach
in fascinating directions. In one, she quotes Theodore Roosevelt in
his autobiography on why trust-busting was NOT the way to control
corporate concentration; government regulation was. In another she
reveals that British diplomat Cecil Spring-Rice ``wrote the lyrics
to `I Vow to Thee My Country,' which became the favorite hymn of
Diana, Princess of Wales, and was played at her wedding and
funeral.''
</P>
<P>
   And in yet another she reveals that Morgan did, after all, have
one admirer on the left. ``In speaking of the capitalists who
strive only for profit, only to get rich,'' Stalin, of all people,
told H.G. Wells in an interview, ``I do not want to say that these
are the most worthless people capable of nothing else. . . . We
Soviet people learn a great deal from the capitalists. And Morgan,
whom you characterize so unfavorably, was undoubtedly a good,
capable organizer.''
</P>
<P>
   Which is an understated way of putting what Ms. Strouse has
argued with such force here.

   KUKES, Albania _ Trouble intensified Wednesday at all three
borders where Kosovar Albanian refugees are trying to flee, as the
Balkans conflict widened with new Serbian aggression against
neighbors.
</P>
<P>
   All the exits from Kosovo posed problems for ethnic Albanians
trying to escape the Serbian ethnic cleansing campaign there.
</P>
<P>
   With border tensions rising, relief efforts will concentrate on
moving refugees to where they are welcome as quickly as possible.
</P>
<P>
   Consequently, the Clinton administration decided Wednesday to
allow Kosovo refugees to come to the United States for shelter
rather than sending them to the U.S. military base in Guantanamo,
Cuba, as originally anticipated.
</P>
<P>
   The decision, announced by Vice President Al Gore in a speech at
Ellis Island in New York, the U.S. gateway for millions of
immigrants, was in part an effort to relieve pressures on
neighboring Macedonia, a top U.N. refugee official said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Ultimately, the American ideals highlighted by Ellis Island
hold the key to peace, tolerance and diversity throughout the
world,'' Gore said. ``We are determined to see a free and peaceful
Kosovo, and one day see democracy throughout the Balkans.''
</P>
<P>
   Serb assaults on villages in Montenegro Wednesday were blocking
or diverting the flight of refugees heading west into that
autonomous province of Yugoslavia, according to Nicholas Morris,
the special envoy to the Balkans region for the U.N. High
Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR).
</P>
<P>
   The Serb attacks apparently were directed at bases in Montenegro
of the Kosovo Liberation Army, or KLA, and they were forcing
refugees to look for ways out of the province they had thought
would afford safety.
</P>
<P>
   At a news conference here Wednesday Morris said the border
between Montenegro and Croatia had been closed by Serb forces,
cutting off that escape route. Some refugees were trying to find
safe haven by crossing further northwest into Bosnia. At least
20,000 had left Montenegro to the south, coming into Albania.
</P>
<P>
   Morris expressed concern over destabilization of Montenegro, as
Serb forces continued their effort to take control of the
Montenegrin police that have remained largely independent and
neutral in the Kosovo conflict.
</P>
<P>
   People apparently were being diverted from crossing into Albania
at the main border point just north of here. Only a handful have
crossed since Yugoslavia cut diplomatic relations with Albania on
Sunday, despite earlier reports that thousands were headed to this
border and Macedonia.
</P>
<P>
   And more shooting across Albania's northern border was reported
Tuesday and Wednesday, during which two Albanian soldiers were
wounded.
</P>
<P>
   The deteriorating security situation in northern Albania has
prompted humanitarian aid organizations to redouble efforts to
remove as many as possible of the estimated 130,000 refugees from
this region.
</P>
<P>
   ``The first time a shell, God forbid, drops in a refugee camp
here, this question of relocating refugees will be academic,''
Morris said.
</P>
<P>
   In Macedonia, where thousands of refugees were being prevented
from entering the country, authorities emptied a desolate frontier
no man's land of refugees in darkness Wednesday, ending a two-day
ordeal of rain, filth and captivity on the heels of the refugees'
expulsions from homes in Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   Morris said Macedonia's government needed guarantees that
further refugees it accepts would be moved out quickly to avoid
upsetting the country's ethnic balance, estimated to be 25 percent
ethnic Albanian before the refugee exodus began.
</P>
<P>
   Macedonia came under sharp criticism from international aid
agencies earlier this month after it kept up to 80,000 Kosovar
Albanian refugees penned up for more than a week in a squalid,
shelterless no man's land at Blace, a few miles from the capital,
Skopje.
</P>
<P>
   This time, at the Lojane crossing, Macedonian officials moved a
bit faster. But aid agencies were again critical, saying they were
prevented from bringing in supplies to the 3,000 trapped refugees,
or from quickly moving them to established camps where they would
at least have food and shelter.
</P>
<P>
   Here in Albania the border remained eerily quiet, after a rush
of about 35,000 refugees between last Friday and the sudden halt of
people midday on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   The respite caused anxious concern for the fate of those still
inside Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have no idea how many, but there are tens or hundreds of
thousands of people who want to leave,'' Morris said.
</P>
<P>
   The absence of new refugees to shelter and feed has given relief
agencies a grace period to prepare new tent camps and try to coax
refugees from the border area.
</P>
<P>
   On Wednesday afternoon the first NATO helicopter evacuations
took place, and about 116 refugees were ferried to Peskopje, about
60 miles to the west.
</P>
<P>
   The aim is carrying out refugees who are ``vulnerable'' and
would have difficulty making a road trip out due to age or illness.
However, the refugees waiting for the choppers said they simply had
volunteered to leave and didn't have any particular problems.
</P>
<P>
   Bad weather delayed these first experimental flights by more
than three hours. Had the Italian military trucks that carried the
refugees out to the airfield simply driven them off to Peskopje,
they probably would have arrived sooner than they did by awaiting
the helicopters' arrival.
</P>
<P>
   After a two-hour wait in the trucks, in cloudy, cold and damp
weather, the refugees did receive a food ration package courtesy of
the U.N. World Food Programme.
</P>
<P>
   British Lt. Gen. John Reith, commander of NATO's new
humanitarian effort, came for the first flights but didn't stick
around long enough to see them happen.
</P>
<P>
   ``Clearly we don't want them (refugees) within range of
artillery fire,'' he said. ``We don't want them to be targets.''

BALKAN FIGHT CAST SHADOW ON NATO SUMMIT 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By CRAGG HINES 
c. 1999 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ A little war can just ruin a birthday party.
</P>
<P>
   Plans for a gala celebration this weekend to mark NATO's 50th
anniversary have become a victim of the fight in the Balkans _ a
conflict that tests the alliance's resolve and relevance.
</P>
<P>
   The three-day summit, beginning Friday, will be a far different
event than was being planned a month ago when NATO, in its first
attack ever on a sovereign nation, began the air campaign against
Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
   Gone is the glitz of tuxedoes and black ties. Gone is the
military flyover. Gone is any hint of triumphalism.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not a party. It's a commemoration of 50 years of what we
believe is the most important alliance we have: NATO,'' said White
House spokesman Joe Lockhart.
</P>
<P>
   The remaining ceremonies have been trimmed to allow a session of
at least two hours in which leaders of the 19 member nations can,
for the first time since the Yugoslav campaign began, have a
face-to-face discussion of the air assault, its prospects and what
it means for the alliance.
</P>
<P>
   The presidents and prime ministers, who set the parameters for
NATO's military action, may consider new economic sanctions against
Yugoslavia, a blockade of its ports and possibly whether an
invasion by ground troops should be considered.
</P>
<P>
   NATO Secretary-General Javier Solana predicted only a more solid
allied front will emerge from the summit.
</P>
<P>
   ``The level of determination is total,'' Solana said. ``This is
not a conflict over territory or raw materials or strategic routes.
Only values are at stake here.''
</P>
<P>
   The White House has responded snappishly to questions about how
the Yugoslav operation has altered once rosy plans for the weekend.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have adjusted the schedule to reflect the fact that there
is a military conflict ongoing in Kosovo,'' Lockhart said.
</P>
<P>
   But more than scheduling is at stake. For some analysts, the
NATO fight with Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic threatens the
alliance's existence.
</P>
<P>
   ``Many are predicting this will be the funeral of NATO,'' said
Sen. Richard Lugar, R-Ind.
</P>
<P>
   It is, at least, a time of testing.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think NATO is on the line now,'' said retired Air Force Gen.
Brent Scowcroft, who was national security adviser to Presidents
Ford and Bush. ``If we do not succeed here, NATO will be severely
strained, if not fractured.''
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Joe Biden of Delaware, ranking Democrat on the Senate
Foreign Relations Committee and a supporter of Clinton policy, said
Wednesday that if NATO had not moved against Milosevic and, now, if
he is not defeated, the alliance ``would have been finished.''
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a very delicate point in NATO's maturation process,''
Biden said.
</P>
<P>
   The North Atlantic Treaty Organization is generally acknowledged
as the most successful military alliance in history.
</P>
<P>
   ``After the recent chaos, it is important to remind ourselves
that in its earlier respects, NATO worked,'' editorialized the
Spectator, a British establishment weekly. ``It brought Europe the
longest period of peace in its history. ... Confronted, the Soviet
Union eventually crumbled.''
</P>
<P>
   The birthday summit was planned, in fact, to show off NATO's
growing ties with former Soviet satellites, especially the new
alliance membership of Poland, Hungary and the Czech Republic.
</P>
<P>
   Even Russia, as a participant in Partnership for Peace, the
so-called ``NATO Light,'' was invited. But the Kremlin's strong
opposition to NATO's air campaign against fellow Slavs has raised
doubts that Russia will even be represented.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the presence of the leaders of at least 43 member nations
of the Euro-Atlantic Partnership Council will make the summit the
biggest international gathering _ and security headache _ ever in
the nation's capital.
</P>
<P>
   To clear out the summit area in downtown Washington, and make
room for dozens of intricately choreographed motorcades, 90,000
federal employees are being given a day off from work Friday. Much
of the area will be closed to any but official traffic.
</P>
<P>
   The opening ceremony will still mark the half century since
NATO's founding and be held in the neoclassical Mellon Auditorium,
where the alliance-founding Treaty of Washington was signed on
April 4, 1949, under the watchful gaze of President Truman.
</P>
<P>
   The new focus on the the Yugoslav campaign has prompted
postponement of an expected debate on when new members might be
added and a long-planned discussion and possible decision on when
NATO would go into combat outside the territory of one of its 19
members.
</P>
<P>
   But even as the agenda shifts, Solana has tried to make a virtue
of what the alliance leaders believe is a necessity.
</P>
<P>
   ``At the age of 50, NATO has left the passive, reactive approach
of the Cold War and today NATO is setting the security agenda in
ways we could only dream about decades ago,'' Solana said.

KOSOVO COSTS COMING OUT OF FEDERAL BUDGET SURPLUS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By JENNIFER CORBETT DOOREN  
 c.1999 Hearst Newspapers  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Even if the United States were to enter into a
full-scale war, complete with ground troops, against Yugoslavia,
the cost would not eat up the government's huge budget surplus,
although it could take a bite out of it, an expert said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   ``It might lop $20 billion to $30 billion off of it,'' said
Robert Reischauer, a former Congressional Budget Office (CBO)
director who is a scholar at the Brookings Institution here. ``But
when we are dealing with a surplus of $110 billion, we've got some
leeway here.''
</P>
<P>
   Reischauer explained, however, that his estimate would be
reached only if the United States deploys ground troops, tanks and
other equipment in the next few months to secure Kosovo, the
southern province of Serbia, which is the dominant republic of
Yugoslavia. The $110 billion surplus is projected for the fiscal
1999 budget year, which ends Sept. 30.
</P>
<P>
   The bite out of the surplus is more likely to be between the $6
billion that President Clinton requested this week to continue the
anti-Yugoslavia bombing campaign through September and around $10
billion, which some Republicans have said is needed.
</P>
<P>
   For this fiscal year, congressional leaders have said they
intend to pay for any Kosovo-related costs out of the surplus
rather than offset them with cuts to other programs, and Senate
Majority Leader Trent Lott, R-Miss., said he wants to keep the
total cost in the ``single-digit range.''
</P>
<P>
   For the future, however, some Republicans want to boost defense
spending even at the expense of the party's cherished plans to cut
taxes.
</P>
<P>
   ``The president sent us a request which I believe to be
deficient to our needs,'' said House Majority Leader Richard Armey,
R-Texas. He declined to say how much higher the Kosovo spending
should be, but said Congress in next year's budget may have to cut
domestic spending and the Republicans may have to scale back their
proposed $800 billion tax cut over 10 years to finance broader
defense needs beyond Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   Kosovo spending is exacerbating the larger debate over what to
do with the surplus after sequestering most of it to bolster Social
Security. The nation's retirement system will have enough money to
pay full benefits until 2034. At that point, unless the system is
changed, benefits will have to be cut or payroll taxes raised.
</P>
<P>
   As for the rest of the surplus, most Democrats want to use it to
shore up Medicare, the health insurance program for the elderly and
disabled, and to increase funding for domestic programs. Most
Republicans want to use it for defense and tax cuts.
</P>
<P>
   In the budget plan that Congress approved last week, lawmakers
from both parties agreed to set aside $1.8 trillion of the
projected $2.3 trillion surplus over the next 10 years for Social
Security.
</P>
<P>
   In figuring the surplus, the government includes the Social
Security trust fund's surplus. If that number is excluded, the
government would actually have a deficit this year of $16 billion,
according to the CBO, or $42 billion, according to the White House
budget office. And over the next decade, the surplus would total
$600 billion, not $2.3 trillion, if Social Security is excluded.
</P>
<P>
   Kosovo's costs in future years would depend on whether ground
troops are deployed, how many are dispatched, how much humanitarian
aid for refugees is needed and how much the United States will
spend on rebuilding Kosovo. President Clinton has said he thinks
the figure should be 25 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Budget experts say the air war over Yugoslavia is now costing
the United States about $1 billion a month. The CBO estimates that
ground troops might cost about $300 million a month while other
analysts put the figure closer to $1 billion a month.
</P>
<P>
   As for refugee aid, the CBO says it cannot estimate the exact
amount, but it noted that the United States spent $254 million in
humanitarian aid and $306 million in reconstruction aid for Bosnia
in 1996. The United States has been paying an additional $200
million a year since them.

COURT WEIGHS STATE'S RIGHT TO CHOOSE CARE FOR MENTALLY DISABLED 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By MARK HELM  
 c.1999 Hearst Newspapers  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ In a case that could produce the decade's most
important ruling on treatment for mental patients, the U.S. Supreme
Court on Wednesday heard Georgia state officials argue that they
should be allowed to choose where the patients receive care.
</P>
<P>
   Georgia officials want the authority to decide whether a mental
patient should stay in a state mental hospital or be moved to a
less restrictive facility, such as community care centers.
</P>
<P>
   Mental health advocates disagreed, arguing that mental patients
who receive approval from a doctor to move from a mental hospital
to a care center have the right under the 1990 Americans with
Disabilities Act (ADA) to be transferred and that the move should
be done within a few weeks of the approval.
</P>
<P>
   The ADA requires increased access to public and private
facilities and programs for disabled individuals.
</P>
<P>
   Disability rights groups prefer community care centers, as
opposed to state mental institutions. The advocates for the
disabled say the community centers allow patients to lead more
productive lives and to interact with society because the centers
are generally group houses in residential communities with medical
support staff.
</P>
<P>
   At issue is Title II of the ADA, which applies to public
services offered by state and local governments. It provides that
``no qualified individual with a disability shall, by reason of
such disability, be excluded from participation in'' or ``be
subjected to discrimination'' by a government program or service.
</P>
<P>
   The court must also consider ADA regulations that require the
services to be administered in the ``most integrated setting
appropriate.''
</P>
<P>
   The meaning of the phrase ``most integrated setting'' quickly
became the focus of the arguments before the justices.
</P>
<P>
   Georgia Senior Assistant Attorney General Patricia Downing told
the court that states should be free to choose between community
settings and large state hospitals so long as each institution
provides proper care for the patients.
</P>
<P>
   ``It cannot be assumed that because one option is appropriate,
another is inappropriate,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Michael Gottesman, a Georgetown University law professor
representing two mentally disabled women, argued that the most
integrated setting for his clients was with ``everyday people and
not in an institution.''
</P>
<P>
   He said forcing the two women to wait for assignment to a
community center amounted to ``isolation and segregation from the
societal mainstream of American life.''
</P>
<P>
   But Justice Antonin Scalia, who appeared sympathetic to the
state, immediately shot back: ``This isn't isolation. They're not
being locked in rooms against their will.''
</P>
<P>
   The two women, Lois Curtis and Elaine Wilson, were free to leave
the state hospital at any time, although leaving would have meant
an end to state medical aid.
</P>
<P>
   Justice Department lawyer Irving Gornstein, representing the
Clinton administration, joined Gottesman in calling for the ADA to
require states to place qualified mental patients in community
centers.
</P>
<P>
   But Justices Stephen G. Breyer and John Paul Stevens voiced
concerns that adding such a requirement might end up harming the
people whom the law seeks to protect.
</P>
<P>
   ``What bothers me is writing something which, as it works out in
the real world, leaves many who need to be in institutions, out _
abandoned on the streets,'' Breyer said.
</P>
<P>
   Stevens said state institutions could feel pressured to transfer
nearly all of their mentally disabled patients to community care
centers, including those who were unable to cope with society, to
avoid violating the ADA.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm concerned that states will have a motive and incentive to
push people out on the streets,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   He added that some states may stop offering community care
services to avoid the costs of transferring patients from state
institutions.
</P>
<P>
   Both a district court in 1997 and the 11th Circuit Court of
Appeals in 1998 ruled in favor of the two women, saying that
placing mental patients in community care centers is required
unless it would fundamentally change a state's services to the
patients.
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   (STORY COULD END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS.)
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Outside the Supreme Court, disability rights organizations, such
as ADAPT and representatives of the Bazelon Center for Mental
Health Law, demonstrated in support of Curtis and Wilson.
</P>
<P>
   Linda Anthony, spokeswoman for ADAPT, said the lawsuit was a
symbolic civil rights case that follows decades of government
segregation of disabled people in mental health institutions.
</P>
<P>
   She said that if Curtis and Wilson lose their case, it could
mean a return to the institutionalization of the mentally disabled.
</P>
<P>
   ``We must destroy this shameful wall of exclusion separating
people with disabilities from other Americans,'' she said before a
crowd of people in wheelchairs.
</P>
<P>
   Nationwide, about 70,000 mental patients are in state hospitals.
</P>
<P>
   The importance placed on this case by advocacy groups could be
seen over the past few months as they organized demonstrations and
mass mailings in many of the 26 states that had formed a coalition
in support of Georgia's appeal by signing a brief as friends of the
court.
</P>
<P>
   As a result of the lobbying efforts, 19 of the states backed out
of the coalition by the time Georgia filed its final brief.
</P>
<P>
   The states remaining in Georgia's camp are Indiana, Tennessee,
Mississippi, Hawaii, South Carolina, Montana, Nevada, Wyoming,
Washington, Texas and Colorado.

<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Soaring three stories inside the entrance to 20
Rockefeller Plaza is a mural by the Conceptual artist Sol LeWitt,
its colors so intense and its surface so glossy that it still looks
wet.
</P>
<P>
   While the wet look may suggest fast work, the mural, which
envelops the entrance to Christie's new American headquarters, took
weeks of painstaking sanding to achieve its smooth surface. Then a
team of four painters spent three weeks, working six days a week,
painting, sanding and varnishing to complete the job for Christie's
opening on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   Less than a month ago nobody except the artist and his team
believed the project _ the first mural to be installed in the
original complex of buildings that make up Rockefeller Center since
1946 _ would be completed as planned. To begin with, the walls had
to be properly prepared.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is always the hardest part of the job and takes a lot of
work,'' said LeWitt, who arrived one morning in late March from his
Connecticut home to survey the work. ``These new walls should not
have a blemish. They should be as smooth as a car's surface, or a
mirror.'' If not, he cautioned, every imperfection becomes a
glaring eyesore when the paint is applied.
</P>
<P>
   That morning the walls were still not as smooth as LeWitt
wanted. The construction crew was instructed to keep sanding and
re-sanding until the walls were glasslike to the touch, and this
was more of an ordeal than anyone had anticipated. It delayed the
project by a week.
</P>
<P>
   Then LeWitt's crew was told that its eight members could not
pick up their paintbrushes until they joined the local painter's
union, a demand he had not encountered on previous projects. His
painters duly joined the union.
</P>
<P>
   Projects of this size are often fraught with problems no matter
how careful the planning. It was over a year ago that officials at
Christie's first contacted Pace Wildenstein, LeWitt's gallery,
about designing a mural for the auction house's new offices. ``It
was a natural to commission a mural because of the space and
because of the history of Rockefeller Center,'' Christopher Burge,
chairman of Christie's in America, said.
</P>
<P>
   The original buildings that make up Rockefeller Center, designed
and constructed through the 1930s by a consortium of architects led
by Raymond Hood, were part of a coherent plan combining several
skyscrapers, outdoor spaces and public art.
</P>
<P>
   Such artists as Isamu Noguchi, Josef Albers, Paul Manship,
Gaston Lachaise, Jose Maria Sert and Stuart Davis were commissioned
to design sculptures, panels and murals for both indoor and outdoor
spaces. (Diego Rivera designed a mural for the lobby of the RCA
Building, but it was removed when the artist refused to alter a
panel glorifying Lenin.)
</P>
<P>
   Because Rockefeller Center is a landmark, the only alteration
the New York City Landmarks Commission allowed Christie's to make
to the building's exterior was to enlarge the windows at the
entrance. ``Our landlords were keen that we do something to animate
the street,'' said Burge. Six windows, three stories high, give
passers-by a peek into the auction house and a view of the mural,
titled ``Wall Drawing No. 896, Colors/Curves.''
</P>
<P>
   The design _ giant curves and undulations of red, yellow, blue,
lavender, green, orange and black _ is by far the boldest and the
brightest by the artist. ``They chose the one I'd hoped they'd
pick,'' said LeWitt, who had offered four designs, including two in
black and white. ``It just seemed best for the space.''
</P>
<P>
   LeWitt, now 70, has designed many murals for public buildings,
including one in the Equitable Building in which bands of lines in
four directions soar six stories, and one under way for the lobby
of a new hotel in Battery Park City. In each of these projects
LeWitt conceived the design and his assistants have carried it out.
</P>
<P>
   ``I started out doing everything myself, but then the projects
got too big,'' he said when asked why he does not paint such murals
himself. ``They do it much better than I do.''
</P>
<P>
   LeWitt began his career working with pencil and paper in the
1950s. He first drew attention for geometric sculptures of white
three-dimensional grids that earned him a temporary place among the
Minimalists.
</P>
<P>
   By the late 1960s he was one of the leaders of the movement that
became known as Conceptual Art, and was transferring his gridded
structures into two dimensions by drawing them on walls. He often
reduced his work to a series of instructions that others would
execute.
</P>
<P>
   By the early 1980s he had moved from austere linear designs to
geometric shapes in rich primary colors. Last year he created a
mural for Pace Wildenstein's SoHo gallery with dense patterns
similar to those of two of the designs he offered to Christie's.
This latest work, with its bold colors and more free-hand
undulations, seems a logical progression.
</P>
<P>
   ``I went from pencil to crayon to ink to acrylic,'' LeWitt said.
The design, which is executed in acrylic paints, recalls late
Matisse collages like ``Jazz,'' and some of the stained glass
designs Matisse executed toward the end of his life for a chapel in
Vence in the South of France.
</P>
<P>
   When LeWitt began working on the Christie's designs, he said, it
wasn't Rockefeller Center he had in mind so much as the space.
``Rockefeller Center is a work of art in itself,'' he said. ``It
resonates with history.''
</P>
<P>
   The space _ a rectangular, boxlike entrance 29.6 feet high and
17.6 feet wide _ leads into the heart of the auction house. LeWitt
said he conceived of the work as a giant panel, like a 15th-century
gesso painting. ``I thought of it as the world's largest
miniature,'' he said. ``It's like a big box in which I had to
figure out how to visually enter the space and move around it. It
had to be bright, shiny, intense, because the area is so
compressed.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   John Hogan, who has been part of LeWitt's team for about 20
years and jokingly calls himself a mixologist, prepares every
bucket of paint. The colors, which come from a Swiss manufacturer,
don't change, but his ``recipe'' calls for other ingredients like
retarders to slow the drying process, distilled water and a binder.
As he stirs on and on he says the paint is ``still cooking.'' As
with a seasoned chef, only he knows when the consistency feels
right.
</P>
<P>
   Sachiko Cho, who leads the artist's crew, works out the design
directly on the wall, at a scale 15 times larger than the maquette.
Once the walls are sanded, she measures and tapes the design in
place, marking each area with numbers, like in a paint-by-numbers
set, to indicate where each color should go. After each coat of
paint the surface is sanded smooth, covered with varnish and sanded
again, a total of seven times.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sol doesn't mind a bit of handiwork showing,'' said Ms. Cho.
``That way it doesn't look as if the paint has been sprayed.'' What
makes the colors so rich and saturated, she said, is the layering
technique. The varnish in particular makes the whole design seem to
pop out from the walls.
</P>
<P>
   Is LeWitt worried that the mural will fade over time, no longer
appearing as if he has just put down his brush? ``Come back in 100
years,'' the artist said. ``That's the only way to tell.''  &QL;

COMPAQ ANNOUNCES ITS `DISAPPOINTING' FIRST QUARTER EARNINGS 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Texas) (rk) 
 By   SAUL HANSELL   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Confirming the bad news that led to the ouster of its chief
executive this week, the Compaq Computer Corp. announced Wednesday
that it earned $281 million in the first quarter, or 16 cents a
share, half of what analysts had expected only two weeks ago.
</P>
<P>
   ``The overall results were disappointing, and they were
unacceptable,'' Benjamin M. Rosen, the company's chairman and
acting chief executive, said in a conference call with reporters.
</P>
<P>
   But Rosen declined to provide much new information to illuminate
the sources of Compaq's problems or to outline its path back to
financial health.
</P>
<P>
   Kevin McCarthy, an analyst at Donaldson, Lufkin &AMP; Jenrette,
said, ``We want to know what went wrong and what their action plan
is to fix it, and the details are still murky on both.''
</P>
<P>
   On April 9, Compaq warned that its sales and earnings would be
below expectations because of price pressure and weaker demand in
the market for business computers. Then last Sunday, Compaq's board
called for the resignation of Eckhard Pfeiffer, the chief executive
since late 1991, and Earl L. Mason, the chief financial officer.
</P>
<P>
   The company's sales were $7.8 billion in the quarter, up 40
percent from a year ago.
</P>
<P>
   Compaq, based in Houston, attributed its disappointing profit to
weak demand from businesses for both personal computers and the
larger systems sold by two recent acquisitions, the Digital
Equipment Corp. and Tandem Computers.
</P>
<P>
   Compaq said its services business _ the sale of programming,
consulting and other advice _ met its own targets, as did the
consumer unit.
</P>
<P>
   The company said it sold 3.5 million computers in the first
quarter, about what industry analysts had expected. But a greater
percentage of those were low-margin machines, including home PCs
selling for $600. Moreover, it has had to cut prices on business
PCs to match competitors.
</P>
<P>
   As a result, the company's gross profit margin _ sales minus the
cost of goods _ was 24.7 percent. That is up from 18 percent a year
ago but down from 26.4 percent in the fourth quarter of 1998.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts said the biggest problems appeared to be the slow and
difficult integration of Digital and Tandem and the complexities of
finding a way to match the efficiencies of Dell Computer _ which
sells directly to customers _ without offending the dealers who
provide the bulk of Compaq's current sales.
</P>
<P>
   ``They tend to blame industry conditions rather than their own
decisions more than I would,'' said Steven Milunovich, an analyst
at Merrill Lynch. ``My guess is they are losing share in the
corporate market to Dell and that DEC and Tandem are weak.''
</P>
<P>
   Compaq's shares closed Wednesday at $24.25, up 25 cents, less
than half the 52-week high of $51.25.

<P>
   Isabelle Huppert is stumped. She just can't figure out why she's
occasionally referred to in the press as ``the little French
mouse.'' But if she'd seen herself sitting in the front row of
January's Yves Saint Laurent couture show, just one seat down from
Catherine Deneuve, she might have some idea.
</P>
<P>
   Deneuve looked like a true Movie Star, with a sweep of
salon-perfect blonde hair riding high above her head, a perfectly
fitted couture suit and a pair of Jackie O-style sunglasses
protecting her from the barrage of flashbulbs.
</P>
<P>
   Huppert, meanwhile, was slouching in a chair, nervously touching
her stringy red hair and shuffling her sneakers as she waited for
the lights to go down, for the photographers' gaze to finally shift
from her to the catwalk.
</P>
<P>
   While the timeless Deneuve may be the First Lady of French
cinema, Huppert is not far behind, just a rung above contemporaries
like Isabelle Adjani and Sophie Marceau. Yet she's much more of an
enigma than France's other leading ladies _ even to her own
countrymen.
</P>
<P>
   Not unlike Garbo, to whom she has occasionally been compared,
Huppert prefers to be alone, sidestepping the spotlight and
avoiding the press as much as she can. Almost nothing is known
about her private life, other than the fact that she's married and
has three children. She's been heard to say that being photographed
without permission is like being raped.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm flattered that people compare me to Garbo,'' says Huppert.
``I don't think anyone can reach the point of mysteriousness she
has, but I'm learning.''
</P>
<P>
   She's doing a fine job. Few people have managed to maintain such
a high degree of both exposure and anonymity. In a little over 25
years, Huppert has made more than 50 films, working repeatedly with
such directors as Jean-Luc Godard and Claude Chabrol. Her
best-known movies include Diane Kurys' ``Entre Nous,'' and
Chabrol's ``Madame Bovary'' and ``La Ceremonie.'' Her latest film,
``The School of Flesh'' (``L'Ecole de la Chair''), which recently
opened in the United States, was publicized on nearly every bus
stop in Paris with a large poster of Huppert's face.
</P>
<P>
   Still, when she enters a Left Bank cafe for an interview,
crossing a crowded room to her table in a dark corner, not one head
turns.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think some people _ more in America than here _ go after the
attention,'' she says. ``They pretend to hate it, but when they
don't get it, it kills them.''
</P>
<P>
   Over tea, Huppert projects the aloofness and mild arrogance that
we often expect from serious French actresses. She's curious about
her reputation in the United States, but despite having appeared in
several American films _ most notably in Michael Cimino's critical
disaster ``Heaven's Gate'' _ she's wary of being lumped together
with her American counterparts.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm always surprised by how many American actresses,
particularly on the West Coast, aren't really actresses,'' she
says. ``It's not true for all of them, of course, but I feel like
French actresses are given more opportunities to be introspective.
We work more with intimacy and personal reflection. But cinema
shouldn't be the same all over the world, I guess. American cinema
should have its own identity.''
</P>
<P>
   Huppert is not one of those one of those Europeans who's eager
to amass American screen credits. When she does chase after a role
in the United States, it's likely to be in a small independent film
that's as complex as the those she makes in France.
</P>
<P>
   In 1993, she wrote an admiring letter to director Hal Hartley
and ended up with the lead in ``Amateur.''
</P>
<P>
   When the letter first arrived, though, Hartley's assistant
didn't know who Huppert was. And while some critics suggest that
Huppert isn't as well-known in the United States as her less
talented French colleagues because ``Heaven's Gate'' was such a
colossal flop, she is quick to refute that.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'd say that it neither helped nor hurt me,'' she says.
``Look, maybe it did change my destiny, I don't know. Yes, it was a
pure failure, but it's not an issue for me. I came over to do one
film, not to stay for my entire career.''
</P>
<P>
   In ``The School of Flesh,'' Huppert plays Dominique, a chic,
successful fashion executive. When she meets a handsome young
ne'er-do-well who works as both a bartender and a bisexual hustler,
she begins pursuing him intently.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's about how passion affects this woman,'' says Huppert, who
turned 44 in March.
</P>
<P>
   Huppert spent weeks discussing the character with director
Benoit Jacquot before shooting began. Jacquot, who directed the
actress in 1980s ``Wings of a Dove,'' says he didn't even have a
second choice for the role of Dominique.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know what she wants to express,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   The actress, says Jacquot, takes an intensely thoughtful
approach to both her life and her work.
</P>
<P>
   ``She uses her face as a landscape,'' he says. ``She can change
it like it's some kind of psychological climate.''
</P>
<P>
   Jacquot, an old friend of Huppert's, also understands the
actress's intense need for privacy _ even on the set.
</P>
<P>
   ``Filming for her is like a night of paradise,'' he says. ``It's
like she's sleeping and she hopes she'll dream right. She's acting
as she's dreaming. Sometimes when I yell `cut,' it's like I'm
waking her up. This is because acting is extremely private for her.
Isabelle has two private lives: the one in front of the camera and
the one in real life.''
</P>
<P>
   In ``The School of Flesh,'' Dominique wields all of the social
and financial power. She plays sugarmama to her young boyfriend,
giving him an allowance and choosing his wardrobe.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a reversal of the classic roles,'' she says.
</P>
<P>
   But Huppert believes the film is a reflection of reality.
</P>
<P>
   ``Older women with younger men are much more accepted now,'' she
says. ``Plus, I think women are looking younger and younger now.''
</P>
<P>
   The actress isn't the least bit concerned that the older she
gets, the fewer roles there will be for her. ``I'm not fighting
aging at all,'' she says. ``Look at Catherine Deneuve. She's always
more and more beautiful. She makes you feel like you want to get
older.''
</P>
<P>
   As for her own public persona, Huppert manages to look on the
bright side. After giving the matter some thought, she flashes her
first smile of the afternoon.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's probably better to be called a French mouse,'' she says,
``than to be called a French snake, or a French cow.'' &QL;

<TEXT>
<P>
   Why? Why? Why? Why? Why?
</P>
<P>
   That was the only word that ran through my mind as I watched the
news programs' pictures of students and parents trying to piece
together the tragedy unfolding before them.
</P>
<P>
   I wanted to scream.
</P>
<P>
   What horror had occurred in Littleton, Colo.?
</P>
<P>
   Why did two students kill 13 people?
</P>
<P>
   Why had people been arbitrarily executed by these students full
of fear, hatred and hurt?
</P>
<P>
   On television, I saw boys my own age crying and hugging
classmates, and parents running to look at lists of the students
who made it out safely. All were so upset by their personal loss.
</P>
<P>
   But those of us who don't go to that high school must feel
something else. Dejection _ and disgust for the hate that caused
this tragedy.
</P>
<P>
   Tired of differences that end up in tragic shootouts. Tired of
looking over our shoulders every time another high school gets shot
up.
</P>
<P>
   But now we cannot see.
</P>
<P>
   Our eyes are clouded with tears for those lost, both the killers
and the victims.
</P>
<P>
   It is time to move forward. The healing of American high schools
is long overdue. The same anger that caused these shootings must
not interfere with the process that MUST take place.
</P>
<P>
   Students must pay more attention to each other.
</P>
<P>
   Look for signs that might seem dangerous or threatening.
Confront friends who use racial slurs, even jokingly. Break the
code of silence that surrounds kids who might be involved in
activities dangerous to themselves and others.
</P>
<P>
   Compassion is an exercise in both tolerance and patience.
</P>
<P>
   We as high school students must have tolerance of others'
opinions and appearance and skin color, and the patience to deal
with differences instead of seeking revenge.
</P>
<P>
   We must accept.
</P>
<P>
   For parents, the compassion that must be shown at school must be
shown at home. Communication skills are taught by example from the
earliest age.
</P>
<P>
   And the guns must be put away. Students who have the direct
resources to further their fanaticism WILL do so.
</P>
<P>
   This is the last time we can let this happen.
</P>
<P>
   All high school communities must move forward, weary of the past
but hopeful for the future; careful not to censure or militarize
but to nurture and communicate.
</P>
<P>
   Change can come only through a shift in student attitudes.
</P>
<P>
   Our generation must be called to stand for something, and the
word ``acceptance'' is crying out.
</P>
<P>
   Boys who did not feel accepted in Colorado decided not to accept
others, and the pain they caused is unacceptable.
</P>
<P>
   It's time to heal our high schools and move toward the promise
of acceptance and real communication.  &QL;

GETTING THE LEAD OUT OF PEWTER
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By ROGERS CADENHEAD 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Q: Does modern British pewter contain lead? I have a pewter
tankard and would like to drink out of it. _ U.C., Fort Worth
</P>
<P>
   A: Although early pewter contained as much as 40 percent lead,
Britannia pewter was introduced by metalsmiths in the 18th century
with 90 percent to 95 percent tin, 5 percent to 10 percent antimony
and ``virtually no lead,'' according to a 1994 ``Country Living''
article.
</P>
<P>
   American pewter manufacturers agreed in 1972 to restrict lead
content to 1/2000th of a product's total weight, but some products
are still being sold with unsafe lead levels. Shirley Pewter Co.
recalled pewter baby cups in 1992 because of their lead content,
according to the Food and Drug Administration.
</P>
<P>
   Because lead can leach into food and beverages, the FDA
recommended in 1993 that consumers ``limit the use of antique or
collectible housewares for food or beverages to special
occasions.''
</P>
<P>
   The National Lead Information Center offers an information
package for consumers about the health concerns associated with
lead-based paint and other products. To request it, call (800)
532-3394.
</P>
<P>
   Q: When did the cartoon featuring Fearless Fly air in the '60s?
_ R.P.T., Worcester, Mass.
</P>
<P>
   A: Fearless Fly appeared on ``The Milton the Monster Show,'' an
animated series originally broadcast on ABC from 1965 to 1967.
</P>
<P>
   ``When Hiram the Fly puts on a pair of super glasses, he becomes
the assertive superhero Fearless Fly,'' series fan Dave Mackey
writes. ``Fearless adversaries include Dr. Goo Fee and Professor
Weirdo.''
</P>
<P>
   Mackey publishes a World Wide Web site devoted to ``Milton'' and
its producer, Hal Seeger.  &QL;

CUOMO CALLS PUBLIC HOUSING A `SUCCESS STORY' 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By DAN FREEDMAN  
 c.1999 Hearst Newspapers  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ In an effort to counteract a long-standing negative
image of public housing, Andrew Cuomo, the secretary for housing
and urban development (HUD), on Wednesday called the federally
subsidized program a ``miraculous success story.''
</P>
<P>
   Cuomo cited a new survey showing 75 percent of public housing
residents are satisfied with their dwellings and he presided over a
ceremony here recognizing 630 public housing authorities as either
``high performers'' or ``successful performers.''
</P>
<P>
   The secretary also unveiled a new HUD analysis of about 750
housing authorities, 22 percent of the nation's 3,400 such agencies
that manage the subsidized units. The survey showed that 87 percent
of the authorities were well managed and on sound financial ground.
</P>
<P>
   Physical inspections of the housing units operated by these
authorities showed 23 percent in excellent condition, 64 percent in
good condition and 13 percent needing improvement, Cuomo said.
</P>
<P>
   ``For many years, for decades, this nation has had a false
impression of public housing,'' Cuomo said, noting that many people
associate all public housing with Chicago's notorious,
drug-and-crime-plagued Cabrini Green housing project. But he added
that ``public housing is a miraculous, miraculous success story''
and insisted that the ``vast majority'' of the nation's 3,400
housing authorities are functioning well.
</P>
<P>
   The survey of residents and analysis of the 750 public housing
authorities did not include any major city such as New York,
Chicago, San Francisco or Los Angeles. Stan Vosper, HUD's chief
spokesman, said HUD would turn its attention to the larger cities
by October.
</P>
<P>
   Vosper also said HUD had not skewed the results of the survey
and analysis by omitting big cities. ``I'd expect some changes in
percentages as we complete our review of the entire stock (of
public housing), but our statisticians are telling us they believe
the final numbers will be quite close to what we're seeing today,''
he said.
</P>
<P>
   Among the housing authorities that Cuomo recognized were those
in San Beunaventura, Calif.; Cohoes, Mechanicville and Watervliet
in New York, and New Braunfels, Poteet, Bastrop, Cotulla, Odessa
and Seguin in Texas.
</P>
<P>
   Overall, HUD oversees 14,000 developments that house 1.3 million
low-income families.
</P>
<P>
   Big cities are where the vast majority of public housing
residents reside, and they are the places where local housing
authorities have been in the most trouble.
</P>
<P>
   Since 1979, the Department of Housing and Urban Development has
kept a list of ``troubled'' housing authorities. Typically, the
authorities on the list have a history of financial mismanagement
and an inability to keep their housing units safe and in good
repair.
</P>
<P>
   Housing authorities in San Francisco, Chicago, New Orleans and
Detroit have been on and off the list over the last two decades. Of
the four, only San Francisco's authority is still on the list,
although Chicago's is now under direct HUD control.
</P>
<P>
   Since 1993 when President Clinton was sworn in, HUD has made a
concerted effort to demolish big, dysfunctional housing units. With
large concentrations of the nation's poorest families, these
projects had become breeding grounds for crime, drug abuse and teen
pregnancy.
</P>
<P>
   Since 1993, HUD has knocked down 45,000 units and plans to
increase that total to 100,000 by 2002, Vosper said.
</P>
<P>
   Cuomo called on the assembled public housing officials to help
rekindle the spirit of the 1930s, when public housing was started
under President Franklin D. Roosevelt. ``We can do it,'' he said.
``We have the capacity. We have the knowledge. (In the 1930s) we
had the right dream, the right aspiration.''

   COLO-SCHOOL-SHOOTING (Littleton, Colo.) _ Ledeall; The death
toll in the shooting at a suburban high school is at 15, with
several students in critical condition. Officers painstakingly
checked the sprawling school; close to 30 explosive devices were
found. By Sam Howe Verhovek.
</P>
<P>
   COLO-SCHOOL-SUSPECTS (Littleton) _ The two 18-year-old suspects
were from affluent areas; one's father was a retired military man,
the other maybe a geologist. They dressed in black trench coats.
They had rich lives on Internet. Other students described them as
outsiders who were smart but did not get along with their peers. By
Dirk Johnson.
</P>
<P>
   COLO-SCHOOL-COLUMBINE (Littleton) _ Columbine High School is
like a lot of suburban high schools, proud of its high SAT scores,
its winning sports teams. Last Friday the school had a giant sports
rally, followed Saturday night by a senior prom for which parents
had raised $50,000 for a no-alcohol after-prom party. It is the
kind of school where a teacher last year assigned her students to
read about the school shooting in Jonesboro, Ark., to help them
understand the real world. By Sarah Rimer.
</P>
<P>
   KOSOVO-MILITARY (Brussels) _ Amid talk of ground troops, British
are trying to force the issue because of the great lag time. The
U.S., wary of politics, is divided. By Michael Gordon.
</P>
<P>
   NATO-SUMMIT (Washington) _ As heads of NATO states began
arriving for the 50th anniversary of the alliance, they were

BILL WOULD GRANT RESIDENCE TO SOME FOREIGN-BORN CHILDREN 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By GARY MARTIN  
 c.1999 San Antonio Express-News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The head of a House immigration panel said he would
introduce legislation Thursday that would grant permanent residence
to foreign-born children of American citizens who face deportation
because of delays in handling their cases.
</P>
<P>
   ``The children of many U.S. citizens are being unnecessarily
punished by the Immigration and Naturalization Service through
bureaucratic processing delays when they apply for legal
residence,'' Rep. Lamar Smith, R-Texas, said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   The proposal by Smith, who is chairman of the House Judiciary
subcommittee on immigration, would ease some restrictions contained
in a 1996 law that tightened immigration rules. Smith also
sponsored that legislation.
</P>
<P>
   He cited the case of Montserrat Rodriguez of San Antonio as he
prepared the bill that would grant legal residence to immigrants
who turn 21 and have a U.S. citizen as a parent.
</P>
<P>
   Rodriguez, a native of Mexico, is the step-daughter of an
American citizen and applied for legal residence when she was 19.
She turned 21 three weeks ago before the INS acted on her request
for permanent residence.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm frustrated,'' said Rodriguez, an honor student at San
Antonio College. ``I wish I never would have turned 21.''
</P>
<P>
   The loss of eligibility for legal residence means deportation
for many young immigrants living in families with a U.S. citizen as
a parent.
</P>
<P>
   Although Rodriguez has received permission to stay in the
country, she will be considered a foreign student and be required
to pay increased tuition. She will be ineligible for student loans
or federal aid.
</P>
<P>
   Rodriguez ``is in kind of a bureaucratic nightmare, a
Catch-22,'' said her lawyer, Bernard Fischman of San Antonio.
</P>
<P>
   ``It has really put her in a heck of a fix,'' Fischman said.
</P>
<P>
   Smith's bill, the Child Status Protection Act of 1999, would
grant permanent residence status immediately to children of
American citizens if their applications are not processed by the
INS by their 21st birthday.
</P>
<P>
   Smith said the bill could provide permanent residence to some
3,000 young people each year.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's outrageous that the INS has allowed the backlog for cases
such as this one to climb to more than a million, causing anxiety
for so many immigrant families,'' Smith said.
</P>
<P>
   Maria Cardona, an INS spokeswoman, said the agency recognized
there are problems and has been seeking remedies.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is widespread support for changing the (current)
statute,'' Cardona said.
</P>
<P>
   The bill has received support of the National Council of La
Raza, the nation's largest Hispanic rights organization.
</P>
<P>
   Joel Najar, an NCLR immigration policy analyst, said the bill
would soften strict legislation sponsored by Smith and passed in
1996.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a welcomed admission that people are getting caught up in
a black hole of INS bureaucracy and a nasty provision in the 1996
law,'' Najar said.
</P>
<P>
   He said he was pleased Smith ``recognizes the bill he drafted in
1996 has its problems.''
</P>
<P>
   ``But it's a shame, if every time these things pop up, we have
to have a small bill to take care of it,'' said Najar, who would
like to see Congress re-examine major potions of the 1996 overhaul
bill.

CLINTON URGES PARENTS TO TEACH KIDS HOW TO RESOLVE CONFLICTS
PEACEFULLY 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By JENNIFER DAY 
c. 1999 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ As investigators in Littleton, Colo., struggled to
understand what provoked two young men to storm their school and
murder classmates, President Clinton said parents must reassure
children that they are safe and remind them that violence is wrong.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton, who canceled a Wednesday trip to Houston and Austin,
made the remarks during a speech to White House volunteers.
</P>
<P>
   ``Parents should take this moment to ask what else they can do
to shield our children from violent images and experiences that
warp young perceptions and obscure the consequences of violence, to
show our children, by the power of our own example, how to resolve
conflict peacefully,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, the president in conjunction with the departments of
education and justice announced a plan to prevent school violence
that included distribution of an ``Early Warning Guide.''
</P>
<P>
   The education department already had begun to revise the warning
handbook before Tuesday's shooting, said spokeswoman Melinda
Malico, but no details have been released as to what changes will
be made or when the new guide will be finished.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, said Education Secretary Richard Riley, $300
million has been earmarked for a school violence prevention
initiative and a proposal is pending in Congress to provide $12
million to help schools hit by incidents such as the one in
Colorado.
</P>
<P>
   The Department of Education has helped coordinate counseling
efforts and has linked Columbine High School officials with
security experts and others who can help with long-term recovery,
said Joe Lockhart, White House spokesman.
</P>
<P>
   Although local officials are handling the investigation, agents
from the Federal Bureau of Investigation and the Bureau of Alcohol,
Tobacco and Firearm have provided technical assistance.
</P>
<P>
   The news of yet another schoolhouse shooting not only prompted
congressmen, presidential candidates and special interest groups
throughout the nation's capital to express their condolences to
those touched by the Littleton massacre, but started another debate
over what can be done to head off another such tragedy.
</P>
<P>
   The Colorado shooting was at least the seventh school shooting
in the past 18 months in which a student has opened fire on
classmates and teachers. The other shootings combined killed 14
people and wounded more than 40.
</P>
<P>
   Dealing with the problem has to be done with a mix of
legislation and a ``bully pulpit function,'' Lockhart said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think the president has a unique role in bringing Americans
together and in raising issues, and I think this is an issue that
has consumed a significant amount of his time as far as trying to
raise the issue.''
</P>
<P>
   The day started in Congress on Wednesday with a moment of
silence for those killed in Littleton.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are no easy answers to these questions, but some things
I do know,'' said House Speaker Dennis Hastert, R-Ill. ``We must do
our best to make our schools safe.''
</P>
<P>
   The crime subcommittee of the House Judiciary Committee will
begin its day Friday by considering a bill to provide mental
counseling for youths who enter the juvenile justice system, said
Rep. Sheila Jackson Lee, D-Texas and chairwoman of the
Congressional Children's Caucus.
</P>
<P>
   However, unless youths such as the two gunmen in Littleton have
contact with the justice system, either through an arrest, truancy
or some other form of misbehavior, they may never get the help they
need.

 By NICHOLAS D. KRISTOF   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   TOKYO _ Yuko Tojo stiffens in her chair as she recalls how her
beloved grandpa vanished at the end of World War II and her mother
eventually told her that he had been killed on the battlefield.
</P>
<P>
   Then, when she was in the fifth-grade, she moved to Tokyo from
the remote village where she had been sheltered during the war and
its aftermath, and the other children teased her by making faces as
if they were being strangled. She did not understand, and her
mother would not explain.
</P>
<P>
   She heard the mysterious word ``koshukei'' whispered about her
grandfather, and so finally she looked up the word in a picture
dictionary. It meant ``to be hanged to death,'' and the dictionary
included a picture of a man in a black hood being hanged from a
gallows. Suddenly everything became clear.
</P>
<P>
   Now, 50 years after a U.S.-backed tribunal hanged her
grandfather, Hideki Tojo, as a war criminal _ he was Japan's
wartime prime minister and the man who ordered the attack on Pearl
Harbor _ Mrs. Tojo is leading a campaign to revise his image. In
just a few years, she has been remarkably successful in winning a
measure of public support in Japan for her portrayal of Tojo as a
national hero.
</P>
<P>
   ``He died for his country,'' she said firmly in an interview in
the building where she keeps an office to fight for his memory.
``He died to save his people.''
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Tojo, 59, spoke on the sofas in the lobby of the building,
steadfastly refusing repeated suggestions that her office might be
more interesting for an interview, and she was accompanied by a
burly man, her aide, who towered over her but ran about on her
instructions to fetch tea and newspaper clippings.
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Tojo's campaign is part of a larger struggle by Japanese
conservatives to change the way Japan perceives its past, so that
children can feel pride rather than shame for what their
grandparents and great-grandparents did in the war.
</P>
<P>
   The issues are extremely sensitive both within Japan and among
neighboring countries _ where millions died during Japan's
invasions and brutal occupations _ but there is little doubt that
it is becoming more acceptable than ever before to say openly in
Japan that Tojo was a great man or that Japan had no choice but to
attack Pearl Harbor.
</P>
<P>
   ``This isn't a private matter about my grandpa,'' Mrs. Tojo
said, somehow managing to speak both primly and passionately. ``To
improve the image of Tojo is to improve the image of wartime Japan,
and that's my aim.''
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Tojo first stepped into the limelight a few years ago,
writing a book about her grandfather that became a best seller,
with 100,000 copies sold. Then there was a movie, ``Pride,'' which
portrayed Tojo as a gentle hero and was the highest-grossing
Japanese movie in the first half of last year.
</P>
<P>
   Another sign of the growing assertiveness of the revisionist
movement was the huge success of an adult comic book, Sensoron,
which came out last year and has sold 550,000 copies so far. It
portrays Tojo as trying ``to protect the honor of Japan'' and
argues that the root cause of World War II was that white people
were colonizing Asia and that the United States was provoking
Japan.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some Asian country had to stand up against Western white
imperialism,'' the book declares. ``And Japan did.''
</P>
<P>
   Just this month, Tokyo voters elected as their new governor
Shintaro Ishihara, an outspoken nationalist who has denounced as
``a lie'' the Rape of Nanking _ an assault on the Chinese city by
Japanese troops in 1937 in which, most historians believe, tens of
thousands died.
</P>
<P>
   ``With the United States occupation after the war, there was
mind control over the Japanese people about their history, and only
now is the mind control being lifted.'' Mrs. Tojo said. ``Now is
the first time that many people are learning the real history of
Japan.''
</P>
<P>
   Leaning forward in her chair, putting down her canned tea, Mrs.
Tojo suddenly grew even more intense.
</P>
<P>
   ``People always talk about Hitler and Tojo in the same breath,''
she said fervently. ``But they were utterly different. Hitler
murdered the Jews, but Tojo didn't kill his own people.
</P>
<P>
   ``Japan was encircled by hostile nations before the war, and it
was strangled by sanctions and had no resources,'' she added. ``So
General Tojo, for the sake of the survival of his people, had to
resort to arms.''
</P>
<P>
   This interpretation of history does not find many followers
elsewhere in Asia, and some Chinese and Koreans worry that Japanese
denials of wartime atrocities mean that the country is likely to
become more militaristic and belligerent in the coming decades.
</P>
<P>
   But Yasuaki Onuma, a law professor and leader in the efforts to
get Japan to atone for wartime atrocities, said that while
right-wing historical revisionists like Mrs. Tojo are becoming more
outspoken and visible, fundamentally that is because they are
losing ground.
</P>
<P>
   Onuma noted that in recent years the Japanese government has
apologized more openly than ever for wartime misconduct and has
acknowledged some brutalities in recent editions of school
textbooks.
</P>
<P>
   ``These changes have frustrated right-wing people,'' Onuma said.
``They feel desperate, and so they have become more vocal.''
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Tojo comes across in conversation as a staunch nationalist,
but not as particularly anti-American. Indeed, she recently
returned from a trip to the United States, where she visited Pearl
Harbor to pay her respects to those killed in the 1941 attack. She
also dropped off her daughter, who is now studying English in
Seattle.
</P>
<P>
   It might seem odd for General Tojo's great-granddaughter to be
studying in the country that he attacked. But Mrs. Tojo says that
the general's dying wish, expressed in writings to his family
members, was to have reconciliation among the wartime enemies and
some kind of joint memorial service.
</P>
<P>
   For now, Mrs. Tojo is planning to continue her campaign to
restore her grandfather's image by building several memorial halls
that would portray the truth of the war as she sees it. She says
her campaign is inspired by her mother's counsel when Mrs. Tojo was
a girl and no one would play with her because of her family name.
</P>
<P>
   ``When we were constantly persecuted, Mom always insisted to us
that grandpa had died for his country,'' Mrs. Tojo recalled,
pausing with a wistful smile. ``She used to say, `Be brave and be
proud!' ''

 &HT;    Debates over Kosovo, domestic harmony define chances for
presidency
 &HT;    By Tom Baxter
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Two very different debates are emerging as the two
parties begin the speeded-up process of picking presidential
candidates for next year. The outcome of the next election could
rest on which debate seems more vital in November 2000.
</P>
<P>
   The debate about Kosovo is being carried on almost entirely on
the Republican side. By the time Vice President Al Gore made his
first major speech on the subject Wednesday, the field of GOP
contenders had already defined a wide diversity of opinion on the
subject.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. John McCain of Arizona has emerged as the most hawkish
advocate of a wider war in the Balkans, with Elizabeth Dole not far
behind. Soon, they'll be taking their place in candidate forums
with Pat Buchanan, who has denounced the action against Serbia as
``an illegal, presidential war''; Sen. Bob Smith of New Hampshire,
who has introduced a resolution to cut off funding of the war; and
Rep. John Kasich of Ohio, who this week called for a negotiated
settlement with Yugoslav leader Slobodan Milosevic.
</P>
<P>
   Unmentioned so far is the GOP frontrunner, Texas Gov. George W.
Bush _ which may be the most significant political development of
all.
</P>
<P>
   Bush may still have an overwhelming advantage, but barring
better news from the Balkans than anyone expects, he will be forced
to articulate a clear position on the war in the months ahead.
Whoever wins the Republican nomination will have their candidacy
forged in the debate over the war.
</P>
<P>
   The debate on the Democratic side _ and former Sen. Bill
Bradley's encouraging New Hampshire poll numbers insure there will
be one _ is much different.
</P>
<P>
   Bradley has expressed some reservation about the
administration's strategy, and Gore, unsurprisingly, strongly
defended it in his speech Wednesday on Ellis Island. What
disagreement there is between the Democratic rivals on this subject
is largely unformed, however.
</P>
<P>
   Among Democratic activists, the speech more likely to stir
interest was the one Bradley gave in New York, only hours before
the shooting began in Colorado, about the need for racial healing
in America.
</P>
<P>
   There is the potential, at least, that the dialogue on the
Democratic side may evolve beyond civil rights homilies into a more
searching discussion of the nation's domestic insecurities, which
as Tuesday's tragedy demonstrated, can be every bit as baffling as
the the Balkan entanglement.
</P>
<P>
   Call this the debate over the Trench Coat Mafia. The Republican
candidates responded to the shootings, but in a manner that
promised no more formed a discussion of what happened in Littleton
than what the Democrats have said about the Balkan war. It's a
matter once again of articulation: Bradley seemed to address the
Littleton murders more directly before they happened than most of
the other candidates did in their aftermath.
</P>
<P>
   Like Bush on the Balkans, Gore can't avoid this domestic debate.
It even sounded an eerie echo in the signature line of his Kosovo
speech.
</P>
<P>
   ``Can we really allow the 21st century to be shaped by men in
black ski masks with weapons in their hands and hatred in their
hearts?'' the vice president asked.
</P>
<P>
   Good question. But with only minor adjustments, it could be
asked about Colorado as well as about Kosovo

HIGH COURT HEARS ARGUMENTS ON EXTENT OF STATES' OBLIGATION TO THE
DISABLED
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Ga.)   (nk) 
 By LINDA GREENHOUSE   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Hearing arguments in an important disability rights
case Wednesday, Supreme Court justices wrestled with what they
appeared to see as a pair of unpalatable alternatives: permit
states to continue confining people with severe disabilities in big
institutions, when such settings are not medically necessary, or
prompt the mass discharge of people who actually need close
supervision and care.
</P>
<P>
   On the one hand, Justice Stephen G. Breyer told the lawyer for
two Georgia women with mental disabilities, who won the right to
care outside the big state hospital where they had lived for years:
``What worries me about your position is writing something that,
the way it works in the world, leads people to be thrown out and
abandoned on the streets.''
</P>
<P>
   On the other hand, Justice Anthony M. Kennedy challenged a
Georgia state lawyer, who argued that federal law does not require
states to provide alternatives to institutionalization: ``You're
saying if hospitalization is excessive, so be it; the state can
make that judgment.''
</P>
<P>
   As presented to the court, this case _ the first of four
disability cases to be heard over the next week _ presents a
relatively narrow legal issue. The question is whether the Justice
Department is properly interpreting the Americans With Disabilities
Act to require that once a state offers treatment to people with
disabilities, the treatment must take place in a ``community
setting'' if that is medically appropriate and not unreasonably
expensive.
</P>
<P>
   But in context, as part of the ongoing struggle over the meaning
of the sweeping yet vague disability law, no one regards this as a
narrow case: not Georgia, which describes the Justice Department
regulation as an unwelcome and unauthorized federal intrusion into
state prerogatives; not people with disabilities and their
advocates, who have described this case as the Brown vs. Board of
Education of the disability rights movement; and, it was evident
Wednesday, not the justices, who were unusually engaged by the
policy implications of the contrasting interpretations that were
put before them.
</P>
<P>
   The provision of the 1990 law at issue prohibits any public
agency from discriminating against a person with a disability ``by
reason of such disability.'' Georgia takes the view that while this
provision requires ``even-handed treatment'' of people who have
disabilities and those who do not, it imposes no requirements for
the actual treatment of those with disabilities.
</P>
<P>
   Justice David H. Souter, addressing Patricia Downing, Georgia's
senior assistant attorney general, objected that the state's
interpretation seemed to assume that all people with disabilities
are alike.
</P>
<P>
   But all disabilities are not the same, Souter went on. He asked
Ms. Downing to consider two groups of people, one group ``simply
unsuited'' to live outside an institution, and another group ``who
can live perfectly well'' on the outside despite their
disabilities. If the state keeps all members of both groups
hospitalized on the ground that all have disabilities, isn't that
discrimination on the basis of disability, Souter asked.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Downing replied that it would not be discrimination as long
as the people in the second group require some level of treatment
and can benefit from being in a hospital.
</P>
<P>
   ``So if they can benefit, that renders irrelevant the fact that
they can get appropriate treatment outside?'' Souter asked with
evident skepticism.
</P>
<P>
   ``The mere fact that someone can be treated in the community
does not constitute discrimination,'' Ms. Downing replied.
</P>
<P>
   The state is appealing a ruling last year by the 11th U.S.
Circuit Court of Appeals, in Atlanta, which held that if treatment
in a group home or other noninstitutional environment can be
provided, it generally must be provided.
</P>
<P>
   Although as many as 26 other states told the court at one point
that they supported Georgia's appeal, that number has dwindled to
seven as governors and state attorneys general responded to the
anger their positions evoked in constituents with disabilities. The
states still supporting a friend-of-the-court brief for Georgia are
Colorado, Hawaii, Montana, Nevada, Tennessee, Texas, and Wyoming.
The most recent states to withdraw were Indiana, Mississippi,
Washington, and South Carolina.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   The Justice Department regulation, which the department calls an
``integration mandate,'' requires states to provide services ``in
the most integrated setting appropriate to the needs of qualified
individuals with disabilities.'' That means, to the extent
possible, that people should be able to live in neighborhoods and
to have the chance to interact with those who are not disabled.
</P>
<P>
   Irving L. Gornstein, an assistant solicitor general, told the
court that in passing the Americans With Disabilities Act, Congress
``understood that the unjustified segregation of people with
disabilities is a form of discrimination.''
</P>
<P>
   Michael H. Gottesman, a law professor at Georgetown University
who represented the two women who brought the lawsuit, tried to
allay the justices' worries that ``states in order to avoid the
risk of liability will have the motive and incentive to push people
out into the community who really shouldn't be there,'' as Justice
John Paul Stevens expressed the concern.
</P>
<P>
   Gottesman said the judgment on the best type of care would in
any event be up to the state's doctors, who had found that his
clients, Lois Curtis and Elaine Wilson, who have both mental
illness and mild retardation, could be treated in the home-like
settings where both now live.

TEXAS 10-GRADERS' TEST SCORES SET RECORD 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By CLAY ROBISON 
c. 1999 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ High school sophomores set a record passing rate
this semester on the state test required for high school
graduation, state Education Commissioner Mike Moses announced
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   At least 90 percent of 10th-graders who are not in special
education passed the reading and writing sections of the exit-level
Texas Assessment of Academic Skills test for the first time in the
exam's nine-year history.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a red-letter day for Texas students,'' Moses said.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Teel Bivins, R-Amarillo, chairman of the Senate Education
Committee, said the results were the ``best scores we've ever seen
in the state of Texas.''
</P>
<P>
   Al Kauffman, an attorney for the Mexican American Legal Defense
and Education Fund, which has sued the state over the exit-level
test, said he also was pleased that the TAAS scores are improving.
</P>
<P>
   ``But I don't think it necessarily shows an increase in
knowledge,'' Kauffman said.
</P>
<P>
   If anything, he added, the improved scores show that schools and
students are more successful at giving and taking the tests.
</P>
<P>
   In its suit, scheduled to go to trial this summer in federal
district court in San Antonio, the Mexican American Legal Defense
and Education Fund contends the exit-level test discriminates
against minority students, partly because of differences in
learning opportunities.
</P>
<P>
   Although test scores for minorities continue to lag behind the
marks for white students, Hispanic and black students continued a
five-year trend of narrowing the performance gap, the Texas
Education Agency reported.
</P>
<P>
   Houston school district officials said they would not release
local figures until their report is formally prepared, although
several other districts released statistics on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Students take the exit-level TAAS for the first time in the
spring semester of the 10th grade. Those who fail any section of it
have several chances to retake those parts of the test during their
junior and senior years.
</P>
<P>
   Only 8,146 of the state's 212,773 high school seniors _ less
than 4 percent _ have not yet passed the test and will have one
more chance to do so next week in order to receive diplomas this
spring.
</P>
<P>
   Students can continue to take the exam, if necessary, after they
leave school.
</P>
<P>
   Among non-special education sophomores taking the exit-level
test for the first time in February, 90 percent statewide passed
the reading test, 92 percent passed the writing test and 83 percent
passed the mathematics test.
</P>
<P>
   The statewide passing rates by ethnicity on each exam were:
</P>
<P>
   Reading _ white, 97 percent; Hispanic, 82 percent; black, 85
percent.
</P>
<P>
   Writing _ white, 97 percent; Hispanic, 86 percent; black, 88
percent.
</P>
<P>
   Math _ white, 91 percent; Hispanic, 75 percent; black, 69
percent.
</P>
<P>
   Seventy-eight percent of the 10th-graders passed all sections of
the exam. By ethnic breakdown, that included 89 percent of white
students, 66 percent of Hispanics and 63 percent of blacks.
</P>
<P>
   Sixty-five percent of low-income sophomores of all races passed
all the sections.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Moses said more work still needed to be done, particularly in
preparing minority and low-income students for the exam.
</P>
<P>
   But, he added, minority students' gains in scores on all three
test sections have significantly outpaced those of white students
since 1994.
</P>
<P>
   He said improvement by minority students on the math section of
the exit test have been particularly impressive.
</P>
<P>
   ``Five years ago, there was a 37-point gap between
African-American students and white students and a 29-point gap
between Hispanic and white students on the exit-level math test.
That gap has shrunk considerably and is now down to 22 points for
African-American students and 16 points for Hispanic students,''
Moses said.
</P>
<P>
   Some 15,318 high school students in special education classes
were exempted by their school districts from the TAAS test,
compared to 11,885 last year. The TEA will use the performance of
special education students for the first time later this year when
it rates school districts and campuses under the state's school
accountability system.
</P>
<P>
   Thirty-eight percent of special-education sophomores who took
the TAAS test passed all sections. Sixty-four percent passed the
reading section, 47 percent passed the math section and 63 percent
passed the writing test.

NATION LOOKING FOR FAITH IN THE FUTURE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By LINDA VALDEZ  
 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHOENIX - Is the face of America changing from John Wayne to
Willie Loman? From can-do toughness to has-been lethargy?
</P>
<P>
   The questions grew out of one of those slick magazines that come
uninvited into my mailbox. This one, called ``Arizona Blue,'' was
from the friendly folks at BlueCross BlueShield of Arizona. The
story on Page 6 says one out of every 10 people suffers from
depression at one time or another.
</P>
<P>
   It's an incredible statistic. And the Mental Health Association
of Arizona says it's just the beginning of a growing trend.
</P>
<P>
   How can this be? We live in a country that's the envy of the
world. Our optimism is legendary.
</P>
<P>
   Way back when Jimmy Carter talked about a national malaise,
people thought it was something to spread on their sandwich. The
very idea that Americans were anything but giddy with delight over
their bounty was an outrage.
</P>
<P>
   We looked at the long gas lines, the high interest rates, the
tight job market and scoffed at President Carter's dire assessment.
We considered it less than patriotic.
</P>
<P>
   Now we live in a country where the stock market is up,
unemployment is down, food is plentiful, life is long _ and one in
10 suffers from depression.
</P>
<P>
   America looks like the stereotypical 1950s housewife. She had
enough labor-saving appliances to run a kingdom, all shiny and new.
She had smiling kids and an attentive husband. Yet more than the
house was empty when everybody left for the day. She cried all
alone.
</P>
<P>
   They used to call it the blues. But these days the diagnosis is
depression. Mental health experts say it is a change in brain
chemistry. The cause can be genetic. Or it can come from a lack of
emotional support coupled with a barrage of negative environmental
stresses.
</P>
<P>
   It could apply to any one of those leaden-eyed people who ride
up the elevator with you at the office.
</P>
<P>
   It could also apply to America, the sad-eyed matron in a nation
full of conveniences.
</P>
<P>
   America gets little emotional support. Republican politicians
harp on our loss of morality, traditional values and fear of God. A
Democratic president provides evidence for their arguments.
</P>
<P>
   Newspapers are full of stories about failure. The school system.
The health care system. The family. We don't question the message.
Instead, we wrap ourselves in the weight of our shortcomings and
wail. We become the downtrodden salesman holding a sample case full
of yesterday's accomplishments.
</P>
<P>
   And there are the negative environmental stressors. Plenty of
them. Littleton, Colo. Laramie, Wyo. Jasper, Texas. Oklahoma City.
A travelogue of tragedy.
</P>
<P>
   The BlueCross article is entitled ``Seeking Help for
Depression,'' but where does a nation go to get back its faith in
the future?
</P>
<P>
   We can't take a slugload of Prozac and hope the feeling goes
away.
</P>
<P>
   Yet attention must be paid to America's misery. Attention must
be paid.

NEW STUDY SHOWS SHIFT IN MASSACHUSETTS ECONOMY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By KIMBERLY BLANTON  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON -- Software, telecommunications and other high-tech
industries have been the source of one-fourth of Massachusetts' job
gains since 1995 and have laid a sturdy foundation for the economy,
according to a study published Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   The University of Massachusetts report examining technology's
impact on the economy found that in the years following the demise
of the minicomputer industry, the state has rebounded smartly.
Unemployment in Massachusetts hit 2.8 percent last month, its
lowest level since the economic peak in the late 1980s, when makers
of minicomputers were booming.
</P>
<P>
   But sharp job losses among high-tech manufacturers caused
economic shifts, which opened the way for growth in
non-manufacturing industries experiencing a boom, including
software, telecommunications, networking and other high-tech
sectors.
</P>
<P>
   A report says the fact that high-tech has taken off would not
surprise anyone who has seen the stock prices of Internet companies
soar. But the report pinpointed the sources of the state's growth
in specific technology sectors.
</P>
<P>
   Using employment data, Craig Moore, a UMass professor of
political economy who prepared the study, said it was an attempt to
provide a more refined breakdown of the technology sector than is
available in state jobs reports.
</P>
<P>
   The study documents ``the most significant shift in our economy
and growth that's taken place in decades,'' Moore said.
Massachusetts, he added, is ``moving from a product-based economy
to an information-based economy.''
</P>
<P>
   Between June 1995 and June 1998, the state had a net job gain of
116,817, Moore's study found.
</P>
<P>
   Of those jobs, 28,783 _ or 24.6 percent of the total _ were
added by the ``information technology sector,'' which now employs
nearly 169,000 people.
</P>
<P>
   Growth among high-tech companies is only part of the story, said
Nicholas Perna, chief economist for Fleet Financial Group. ``A lot
of the other signs of prosperity we see in the Commonwealth _ an
ebullient housing market and the fact you can't get a parking space
downtown,'' Perna said, ``are the consequences of the high-tech
boom.''
</P>
<P>
   Software accounted for much of the explosive growth in services
_ 61,000 service jobs were added in the three years studied.
Services include many of the state's software firms as well as
consulting firms that sell technology services to business
customers.
</P>
<P>
   Massachusetts still ranks after California in software
employment (134,419) and has fallen behind Texas (56,778), where a
booming software industry has sprouted around the University of
Texas in Austin. Massachusetts, a much smaller state, employed
36,640 in software.
</P>
<P>
   Although job growth in Massachusetts software grew by 43 percent
during the three years studied, it slightly lagged nationwide
growth of 52 percent in software.
</P>
<P>
   But, gains in computer networks and telecommunications in
Massachusetts outpaced the nation, the study said.
</P>
<P>
   Much of the growth can be seen around routes 128 and 495, the
two big eastern Massachusetts beltways. Big companies such as Cisco
Systems are growing, and small, start-up companies creating new
hardware and software for telecommunications and the Internet are
flourishing.
</P>
<P>
   That industry, tagged ``systems integration'' _ hardware and
software linking computer systems as well as telecommunications and
services _ is growing faster than any other sector, the study said.
</P>
<P>
   Michael Harrison, executive director of the Massachusetts
Telecommunications Council, said 1996 deregulation has led to
fierce competition _ and growth _ among internet service providers
and telephone, cable and other carriers, fueling demand for new
types of software, as well hardware such as switches and routers.
``The reason it's growing is the technologies are growing so
rapidly,'' Harrison said.
</P>
<P>
   The systems industry added 11,386 jobs in Massachusetts, growing
174 percent from 1995 to 1998. That compared with US growth of 52
percent, according to report.

ANOTHER SENIOR OFFICIAL LEAVING POLAROID 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By ALEX PHAM  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Polaroid Corp. says another top executive would be leaving the
financially struggling Cambridge company.
</P>
<P>
   Carole J. Uhrich, executive vice president and assistant chief
operating officer, said Wednesday she will be leaving after 33
years at the instant photography company to ``pursue other
opportunities.''
</P>
<P>
   Uhrich is the second high-level executive to leave Polaroid in
recent months. In December, Serafino ``Sandy'' Sosa, the company's
senior vice president for worldwide marketing and new product
development, resigned for ``personal reasons.''
</P>
<P>
   Polaroid observers say the departures leave a new triad of key
leadership consisting of Gary DiCamillo, chairman and chief
executive; Jerry Noonan who replaced Sosa as top marketing
executive; and Judith Boynton, chief financial officer. All three
have joined Polaroid in the last four years.
</P>
<P>
   Uhrich's move did not surprise Wall Street analysts, and her
announcement barely registered on the company's stock, which crept
up 1/16 to close at 20 1/4 Wednesday on the New York Stock
Exchange. For months, speculation whirled that Uhrich, 55, aspired
to be chief executive of Polaroid, a hope that may have been dashed
when DiCamillo, 48, joined the company in 1995.
</P>
<P>
   ``She wants to run a company, and she didn't see any likelihood
of that at Polaroid with Gary being seven years younger than she,''
said Pete Enderlin, analyst at FAC-Equities in New York.
</P>
<P>
   Uhrich said she is weighing several job options, both locally
and nationally.
</P>
<P>
   ``My future plans are hopefully to run a company, and I'm
talking to several people right now about that possibility,''
Uhrich said.
</P>
<P>
   Polaroid has already launched a search for Uhrich's successor,
said DiCamillo, who predicted that the company would make a
selection within ``a couple of months.'' In the meantime, Uhrich's
duties will be shared by DiCamillo and Boynton.
</P>
<P>
   Enderlin predicts that the job will be filled internally.
``Chances are they will stay within the company,'' he said. ``They
already have enough management depth to be able to do that and it
will send the right message to management.''
</P>
<P>
   Polaroid is struggling to make a comeback and reverse a
four-year financial slide. Polaroid is betting that three new
products _ called PopShots, JoyCam and PocketCam _ aimed at younger
consumers will pull the company from its doldrums. The strategy is
showing early signs of success. The company lost $15.1 million in
the first three months this year on revenues of $379 million, far
less than in previous quarters.
</P>
<P>
   ``New products are going to be key to Polaroid's survival,''
said Ben Reitzes, vice president of PaineWebber in New York.

   RINAS AIR FIELD, Albania _ This mud-slicked tarmac moved toward
a war footing Wednesday after the first formation of U.S. Army's
most lethal tank-busting helicopters touched down here and prepared
to battle Serbian forces.
</P>
<P>
   Hundreds of U.S. troops lined up along the runway to gawk as the
six wasp-shaped Apaches skimmed in to land at Albania's only
functioning civilian and military airfield.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought they were going to play 'The Flight of the
Valkyries,' like in 'Apocalypse Now,''' said one impressed
onlooker, U.S. Army Sgt. Matt Fredrickson, 24, of Cedar Rapids,
Iowa.
</P>
<P>
   But as ``Task Force Hawk'' progressed to a new level at this
airfield, the White House said it would support revising NATO's
six-month study on sending ground troops to Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   If NATO Supreme Commander Gen. Wesley Clark and
Secretary-General Javier Solana ``believe it's prudent to update
the assessment, based on the changing circumstances on the ground,
we would support that,'' spokesman Joe Lockhart told reporters at
the White House.
</P>
<P>
   The 1998 assessment concluded that as many as 75,000 ground
troops would be needed in Kosovo alone and that fighting through to
Belgrade and the rest of Serbia could require 200,000 soldiers or
more.
</P>
<P>
   The first Apache missions are being kept a secret, and will come
with no advance warning, according to military officials.
</P>
<P>
   ``The first one to know when we are going to go will be Slobodan
Milosevic,'' said U.S. Army spokesman Capt. Mark Arden, 29, an
Apache pilot now serving as a staff officer.
</P>
<P>
   NATO has been frustrated in its efforts to degrade Milosevic's
Serb infantry and armored units in southern Kosovo province, which
can melt into mountain terrain and pick times to attack when most
fighter aircraft are ineffective.
</P>
<P>
   Taking no chances at having the mission fail, NATO's Clark
assigned one of his top deputies, Army 5th Corps commander Lt. Gen.
John W. Hendrix, to run Task Force Hawk, as the Apache attack
brigade has been designated.
</P>
<P>
   ``(Serbian forces) have been successful so far against women and
children that are unarmed,'' Arden said, ``but I think the table is
about to turn when we enter the conflict.''
</P>
<P>
   It's not difficult to understand where this confidence comes
from.
</P>
<P>
   Flying in from a base in Brindsi, Italy, the six Apaches -- the
first of 24 to be deployed throughout the area -- that flew in
through a slate-gray sky from the direction of the Adriatic Sea and
touched down an hour before sunset looked sleek and powerful.
</P>
<P>
   The scene seemed like an aerial procession of matadors before a
very deadly bullfight.
</P>
<P>
   They were as part of a deafening convoy of 15 helicopters that
also included five troop-carrying Blackhawks, two Chinook
heavy-lifters and two Blackhawk medivac choppers. The stately
procession hovered in a low-level loop over the airfield before
they alighted.
</P>
<P>
   NATO has earmarked another 18 Apaches to intensify the air war
against Serbian tanks, heavy guns and troop formations. There was
no word on when the other 18 would arrive, or whether they all are
needed here before the first Apaches can start strikes into Kosovo
and Serbia.
</P>
<P>
   The arrival of the Apaches comes several days later than
originally estimated by the Pentagon when it was announced in late
March they would be part of the air war against Serb forces.
</P>
<P>
   As late as Tuesday, the U.S. military struggled to adjust to a
decision that the originally chosen site for the Apaches -- well
removed from the hard airstrip here, in a remote field cordoned off
from the rest of the base, wouldn't work.
</P>
<P>
   And incessant rains had turned the open plain to a near marsh,
delaying deployment of the Apaches.
</P>
<P>
   But now that they're here, Arden said the Apache pilots ``are
all fired up -- they know that they are the tip of the spear in the
entire United States military.''
</P>
<P>
   He called the Apaches ``highly lethal'' and said that ``we
expect that those (Serbian) forces will suffer heavily under our
attacks.''
</P>
<P>
   (EDs: Story can end here. Optional add follows.)
</P>
<P>
   During the Gulf War, the AH-64 Apaches were credited with
destroying more than 500 Iraqi tanks, plus scores of artillery
pieces and armored personnel carriers -- all without the loss of a
single Apache.
</P>
<P>
   Correspondents viewed long lines of Iraqi tanks, each with a
blackened hole the size of a grapefruit at the base of the turret.
cut???
</P>
<P>
   But an Apache pilot was also responsible for one of the worst
``friendly fire'' episodes in the Gulf War.
</P>
<P>
   In the heat of combat, the pilot -- an experienced Apache
veteran who was a lieutenant colonel -- accidentally transposed two
map coordinates and launched several laser-guided Hellfire
missiles. They scorched two American Bradley fighting vehicles,
killing two Americans and wounding six.
</P>
<P>
   The Apaches that arrived Wednesday in Albania were part of the
11th Attack Aviation Regiment based in Hildesheim, Germany. The
Gulf War ``friendly fire'' episode'' also involved a pilot from the
11th Attack Aviation Regiment, who left the service almost
immediately after the accident.
</P>
<P>
   Some American commanders in the Gulf were so distrustful of the
Apaches' inability to distinguish ``friendly'' targets at night
that they ordered the advancing American tank columns to move only
by daylight.
</P>
<P>
   Asked Wednesday whether the Apaches will be able to avoid
striking columns of refugees in Kosovo by accident, Arden said,
``We are aware that there are civilians on the battlefield . . . We
believe every measure has been taken to reduce the possibility of
collateral damage.''
</P>
<P>
   Arden said that since the Gulf War, the Apaches have been fitted
out with advanced computerized targeting equipment to allow the
pilot and his co-pilot/gunner to identify targets more precisely.

BC SIGNS STARTING BC GUARD COLLINS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By ALLEN LESSELS  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON -- Boston College center and the Patriots' first draft
pick, Damien Woody, may have familiar company to his right on the
offensive line in training camp.
</P>
<P>
   Dan Collins, the starting right guard at BC last fall, was one
of the 10 undrafted free agents the Patriots announced they had
signed Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Thursday, Collins and Woody and the rest of the team's recent
signees and rookies are due in for a weekend rookie orientation.
Collins, who played at 6 feet 5 inches and about 285 pounds last
season, is up to 300 now. He and Woody, 6-3 and 319, were two of
the very big reasons the Eagles put up 4,527 yards in total offense
last year, with Mike Cloud running for 1,726.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had a good line last year,'' said BC coach Tom O'Brien.
``We had a guy taken in the first round, a guy in the third (guard
Doug Brzezinski by Philadelphia) and one who signed as a free
agent. That's not bad.''
</P>
<P>
   O'Brien, incidentally, said the Patriots did not contact him to
talk about Woody before taking him with their first draft pick. He
said he didn't know whether it was common for NFL teams to check in
with college head coaches on high draft picks before the draft.
</P>
<P>
   ``Maybe it's not for the Patriots,'' O'Brien said. ``I've had
other kids who were first-round draft choices and someone would
come in and talk with me, but maybe that not where the Patriots
are.''
</P>
<P>
   And the Patriots, he said, might have talked with Jeff
Jagodzinski, the former BC offensive line coach who is now with the
Green Bay Packers.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would presume they did,'' O'Brien said.
</P>
<P>
   The issue arose after the weekend when O'Brien commented
candidly to reporters about Woody.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just told the truth,'' O'Brien said. ``He didn't play as
well last year as he did in our first year. They asked me a
question and I gave an honest answer. He was much better as a
sophomore than as a junior. But he has tremendous potential and
great upside. I think he came in too heavy last year and lost some
quickness. But he can be an All-Pro as far as I'm concerned; he's
got that much talent.''
</P>
<P>
   Collins credits Jagodzinski and Woody, who passed up his senior
year of eligibility, with helping him switch from the defensive to
offensive side of the ball. He was moved during the spring before
his junior year.
</P>
<P>
   ``As soon as I made the move, I knew that was where I
belonged,'' Collins said. ``I felt a lot more comfortable from Day
One. Damien helped me a lot through the transition. He knows his
stuff and he'd always pull me aside if he noticed I needed help and
help me through it.''
</P>
<P>
   Collins became a starter as a senior.
</P>
<P>
   ``He did a great job for us last year,'' O'Brien said. ``He
seemed to solidify the line for us. He's a very physical player.
He's a tough kid. I wish for his sake he had played offense a
little longer, he'd probably be further along in technique. But
he'll work and play for them and if they have patience and give him
an opportunity, he'll do a good job for them.''
</P>
<P>
   Besides the yards for the team and Cloud, Collins said the line
took great pride in the fact that it led the Big East in fewest
sacks allowed with 13.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were happy with the year we had,'' Collins said. ``The big
thing was the least amount of sacks in the league. It wasn't that
hard to block for Cloud. He made plays on his own. It was a gift to
block for him.''
</P>
<P>
   The first time Collins toured Foxborough Stadium he was perhaps
6 and lived in Ohio and his uncle, Matt Cavanaugh _ then a Patriot
and now the Chicago Bears offensive coordinator _ flew him out for
a visit and a game.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've been going to games as long as I remember,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   After starring at BC, he is excited about the next step, about
20 minutes down the road.
</P>
<P>
   ``Playing in the NFL is what you dream of,'' Collins said. ``And
playing for the hometown team is just gravy. It doesn't get any
better than that.''
</P>
<P>
   Collins is under no illusions about where he stands with the
team. The Patriots had called before the seventh round to say they
had two picks in the round and weren't sure what they were going to
do, but were very interested either way. He was not picked, but
within 15 minutes of the end of the draft, his agent had a deal
with the Patriots.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not sure what to think as far as making the team,''
Collins said. ``I'm going into this hoping to at least get on the
practice squad. I feel I have a lot of room for improvement. I
think I have a lot of upside and I can learn and get better. I
haven't plateaued. I want to get in and develop with a good line
coach and turn into a player eventually.''

BRUINS GIVEN AN EDGE OVER HURRICANES 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By NANCY L. MARRAPESE  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON -- They're the sixth seed and they're the favorites.
Figure that one out.
</P>
<P>
   But the truth is, when the Bruins open their best-of-seven
first-round Eastern Conference series against the third-seeded
Carolina Hurricanes Thursday, they will be slightly favored by
virtue of finishing the regular season with a better record.
</P>
<P>
   So, what does that mean? Not much, really. The Hurricanes,
formerly the Hartford Whalers, are making their first postseason
appearance in seven years. That, too, is misleading since many of
their players have had plenty of playoff success with other teams.
</P>
<P>
   How do you evaluate this matchup? All in all, it's pretty even.
The season series finished at 2-2-1. Bruins coach Pat Burns, who
ran a spirited workout at the team's practice rink in Wilmington,
told the media and his players that everything that has brought
them to this point no longer has a great deal of meaning.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a new season; you've got to be ready,'' said Burns, who
will be without No. 2 center Joe Thornton for at least Game 1
because of a bruised sternum. ``I think we're ready. We're the
favorites and that's the difference this year and we have to live
with that. We've got more points than them, it doesn't mean
nothing.
</P>
<P>
   ``But when you're the favorites, they feel like they're the
underdogs. We have to go in there and make sure we're ready. It's
game by game. You lose one, you win one, nothing is won until it's
all done. We have to get our head on straight, understand our
responsibilities, be accountable for what you have to do, and
everything should be all right.''
</P>
<P>
   A year ago, the Bruins were the fifth seed, matched up against
Washington. The Capitals beat the Bruins and made it to the Stanley
Cup finals before being swept by Detroit. Ray Bourque said this
team, which is more seasoned than the rookie-heavy club of 1997-98,
won't be happy just to be there.
</P>
<P>
   ``Last year, it ended with a sour taste, knowing that we played
pretty well and didn't have anything to show for it,'' said
Bourque, entering his 19th postseason. ``I think we were excited to
come into the year and picking up where we left off. We never
really got to that point until a month and a half ago, when
everybody got healthy and we started playing the type of hockey we
thought we were going to play all year.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think we're just excited about the opportunity of being back
in the playoffs and competing and going out and winning. We don't
just want to compete, we want to win the series and go from there.
It would be huge for this team. It isn't going to be easy but we
feel we have enough in this room to get it done.''
</P>
<P>
   If the Hurricanes have an edge, it's in the size department.
They're aggressive, well-coached, and big. Boston has better
goaltending, talented forwards, and excellent skaters.
</P>
<P>
   ``More than ever now, the experience factor counts,'' said
Burns. ``Even more at this time of year because players know what
it takes to get by a round, they know what it takes to play a game.
They know not to get excited or down if you lose one. I don't have
a lot of guys who have been by too many one-rounders. You get Ray
to talk in a meeting. He's got knowledge. This first round is the
toughest one, and then things seem to pick up a little more and you
start feeling good about yourself. These first rounds are always
tough.''
</P>
<P>
   Bourque is one of the few Bruins left who even remember the
Hartford Whalers, who moved to Carolina after the 1996-97 season.
From Keith Primeau to Sami Kapanen to Gary Roberts to Arturs Irbe,
the Hurricanes have plenty of talent to be reckoned with.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're a very good team,'' said Bourque. ``They're very
solid, a lot of experience, good size, good speed. They don't have
any major weaknesses on their team. They're the type of team that
you look at their lineup and say why aren't they doing any better.
They're a dangerous team.''
</P>
<P>
   And center Tim Taylor and the rest of his teammates feel the
Hurricanes' regular-season record should not affect the Bruins'
thinking.
</P>
<P>
   ``So many times a team underachieves during the season and then
all of a sudden they come alive in the playoffs and they're the
money players,'' said Taylor. ``Hopefully, that's what we are in
here. We know they have a lot there.''

SHADOW OF KOSOVO LOOMS OVER NATO ON EVE OF SUMMIT
</HEADLINE>
   (mb) 
 By JANE PERLEZ   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ As the leaders of NATO countries began arriving
here Wednesday for the 50th anniversary of the alliance, they were
embarking on a summit transformed from a celebration of triumph to
a war council on the Balkans.
</P>
<P>
   The future of the alliance _ which successfully stood up to the
Soviet Union and its Communist allies in the Warsaw pact, but which
has been grappling for a new role since the collapse of the Soviet
bloc _ has unexpectedly come to hinge, NATO leaders say, on the
outcome of the conflict with Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic.
</P>
<P>
   Simply put, said Sen. Joseph R. Biden Jr., D-Del., in remarks at
the Senate Foreign Relations Committee this week: ``If we do not
achieve our goals in Kosovo, NATO is finished as an alliance.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton administration officials and the NATO leaders are hoping
that the summit will illustrate the utility of NATO and that the
alliance, rather than being an obsolete ornament striving for a new
mission, is actually functioning as it should.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our message is that the NATO of the future is as good as the
NATO of the past,'' said Ronald Asmus, deputy assistant secretary
of state for european affairs.
</P>
<P>
   Asmus said that NATO had to be able to deal with crises outside
its member states, and Kosovo, he said, underscored that NATO had
come together in such a way.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, the war against Milosevic is the first instance in the
history of NATO in which the alliance is acting as a regional
policeman rather than the way it went along for its first 40 years
as a partnership bound by a mutual defense treaty, without firing a
shot.
</P>
<P>
   After its enemy evaporated with the end of communism, NATO
methodically expanded by selecting three former satellites of the
Soviet Union for membership in the alliance _ Hungary, the Czech
Republic and Poland. NATO also extended its mission to include
peacekeeping operations in areas outside its own membership, such
as Bosnia.
</P>
<P>
   There were other initiatives planned in the last year that were
intended to bring the alliance forward.
</P>
<P>
   Before the conflict in Kosovo appeared on the horizon, the
Clinton administration pushed NATO to deal with the next century by
embracing a new initiative on the spread of chemical, biological
and nuclear weapons. This was a way the administration argued for
NATO to become a modernized post-Soviet organization.
</P>
<P>
   Secretary of Defense William Cohen said that, as planned, a
center for these weapons of mass destruction would be unveiled this
weekend.
</P>
<P>
   But these plans will pale at the summit compared with the
immediacy of preventing a possible debacle in Kosovo and a
humiliation for the alliance.
</P>
<P>
   The last thing the Clinton administration wants to emerge from
this weekend is the notion that a Balkans dictator can stand up to
NATO air power and wreak havoc with the alliance, officials said.
</P>
<P>
   But it will be difficult to avoid the fact that Milosevic has
drawn the alliance into turbulent waters.
</P>
<P>
   ``Kosovo has brought NATO into the never-never land,'' said
David Gompert, vice president of Rand who was on the National
Security Council in the Bush administration. ``It has brought us
into a situation where a regime that slaughters its own people is
no longer sovereign and where the United Nations Security Council
is no longer a requirement.''
</P>
<P>
   The stakes are so high over Kosovo that Gompert outlined two
stark outcomes.
</P>
<P>
   ``Assuming NATO doesn't shatter, something positive will emerge
from this tragedy,'' he said, adding that the most important result
could be a stronger relationship between the United States and its
European allies.
</P>
<P>
   ``If NATO cracks and as a consequence fails in Kosovo,'' there
would be a new realignment of the Western allies. In essence, he
said, an ``unprepared'' Europe would be left to take care of the
defense of Europe and the United States would turn almost
exclusively to the defense of Asia.
</P>
<P>
   Before Kosovo, the centerpiece of the summit was to have been
the adoption of a new ``strategic concept.''
</P>
<P>
   Thus, as the NATO leaders confront what amounts to the fourth
Balkan war of this century and discuss the scope of the atrocities
against ethnic Albanians by Milosevic, they will also be
fine-tuning the wording of the strategic concept.
</P>
<P>
   The new concept talks of ``crisis management and partnership''
with non-NATO countries. This is an idea that can be broadly
interpreted to cover the war in Kosovo, officials said. But even
so, they added, it stops short of asserting that NATO should go to
war over an ethnic conflict.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps most telling is what will not be stated in the new
strategic concept.
</P>
<P>
   One of NATO's most cherished descriptions of itself will be
dropped. Thus, these lines that were at the heart of NATO's last
strategic concept, written in 1991 when the Soviet Union was still
alive, will disappear: ``The Alliance is purely defensive in
purpose: None of its weapons will ever be used except in
self-defense.''
</P>
<P>
   To deal with new responsibilities outside the territory of its
members, NATO created several institutions under the alliance's
umbrella. One will be prominently on display at the summit, another
will be conspicuously absent. The Permanent Joint Council,
established as the place where Russia would be informed on NATO
matters, is now suspended after the Russians walked out in protest
against the Kosovo air campaign.
</P>
<P>
   But suddenly more important is the Euro-Atlantic Partnership
Council, founded in 1997 for the 25 countries that belong to the
Partnership for Peace program _ such as Romania, Bulgaria, Croatia,
and Slovenia.
</P>
<P>
   As part of its search for a new mission in the early 1990s, NATO
invited countries to join the Partnership for Peace. The program,
conceived at the time by Secretary of Defense Les Aspin, was
intended to encourage non-NATO members to develop civilian control
of defense ministries and to start joint planning and joint
military exercises with NATO.
</P>
<P>
   By broadening its principals and methods across Europe to such
former communist states as Ukraine, Slovakia, Georgia and as far
afield as Tajikistan, NATO found new participants for peacekeeping
and humanitarian operations. For example, Ukraine, which joined the
Partnership for Peace program, is part of the peacekeeping force in
Bosnia.
</P>
<P>
   Some of the partner countries, most notably Albania and
Macedonia, have become what the Clinton administration calls
``front-line'' states in the Kosovo war, the places where Milosevic
is attempting to create turmoil by expelling hundreds of thousands
refugees onto their territory.
</P>
<P>
   These countries now need as much help as they can get from NATO.
In recognition of this, a special session of ``front-line'' states
was hastily added to the summit schedule, yet another reminder that
the once-formal ceremonial meeting has been transformed by
Milosevic to deliberations about war.

REGGIE LEWIS JURORS TO HEAR SOME DRUG EVIDENCE, JUDGE RULES 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (a and s coding)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By SACHA PFEIFFER  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON -- A judge has ruled that allegations of illegal drug use
by the late Boston Celtics star Reggie Lewis may be considered as
evidence at an upcoming malpractice trial resulting from his death.
</P>
<P>
   But Superior Court Judge Thayer Fremont-Smith said Wednesday
that jurors will only be able to hear specific allegations if
lawyers for the four doctors Lewis's widow is suing can prove a
connection between Lewis's alleged cocaine use and the doctors'
failure to diagnose the heart condition that killed him.
</P>
<P>
   Lawyers for Lewis's widow, Donna Harris-Lewis, had asked that
any evidence of illicit drug use be barred from the trial,
scheduled to begin next week, arguing that the issue had been
raised ``for the sole purpose of trashing'' Lewis's reputation.
</P>
<P>
   After a hearing Wednesday in Suffolk Superior Court,
Fremont-Smith ruled that evidence of drug use would be relevant
``if it can be proven.''
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Gilbert H. Mudge Jr., the cardiologist who treated Lewis,
said he could not accurately diagnose Lewis's condition because
Lewis withheld information on his cocaine use until two weeks
before he collapsed and died on a basketball court.
</P>
<P>
   Fremont-Smith said he would decide what, if any, evidence of
drug use would be admissible on a case-by-case basis during the

NATO DIVERSITY A WEAKNESS IN EFFORT AGAINST MILOSEVICH 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By KEVIN CULLEN  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   LONDON _ As he boarded a flight Wednesday for NATO's 50th
anniversary celebration in Washington, British Prime Minister Tony
Blair was said to be carrying, in his head at least, a plan to
persuade President Clinton of the need to send ground forces into
Kosovo sooner rather than later.
</P>
<P>
   Blair's lobbying mission, which he was to begin Wednesday night
at a White House meeting, could be one of many as leaders of NATO's
19 countries converge to brainstorm on how to prevail in the
alliance's biggest challenge since winning the Cold War.
</P>
<P>
   The gathering, and the temporary shift of NATO's headquarters
from Brussels to Washington for nearly a week, reflects both the
strength and the weakness of the alliance as its battle against the
regime of Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic enters its 30th
day.
</P>
<P>
   The essence of NATO and its formidable power is contained in
Article 5 of the North Atlantic Treaty, which notes that ``an
attack against one or more of them in Europe or North America shall
be considered an attack against them all.''
</P>
<P>
   But if there is strength and security in numbers, there is also
the difficulty of reaching consensus. Everything NATO does, from
deciding to target Milosevic's regime in the first place to what
sort of military tactics to employ, must be approved by each of the
19 members.
</P>
<P>
   While NATO has stuck exclusively to an air war because there is
little political stomach for sustaining casualties on the ground in
Kosovo, Blair's idea to make the threat of ground forces more
credible is likely to get a good airing. A senior administration
official in Washington Wednesday said the weekend summit will
address the issue of ground troops, even though no decision is
imminent.
</P>
<P>
   ``It would be impossible for leaders not to discuss ground
troops. But will there be decision making on ground troops? I don't
see that,'' said the official.
</P>
<P>
   Gen. Wesley Clark, the American who is NATO's supreme commander,
has reportedly complained about trying to wage a war with two hands
and one leg tied behind his back. For example, while the NATO
countries have signed off on air strikes against oil refineries in
Serbia, one of the two republics that make up the Yugoslav
Federation, some have balked at the idea of a naval blockade of
Montenegro, the other Yugoslav republic.
</P>
<P>
   Clark and his advisers believe a blockade is needed to cut off
refined oil arriving by tanker. France is the most outspoken of
NATO nations that believe it would take a United Nations Security
Council resolution to authorize a blockade.
</P>
<P>
   Privately, NATO commanders complain that their job is much
harder because their political masters on the North Atlantic
Council, NATO'S poitical arm, must reach consensus on decisions
about military tactics. Publicly, however, that accountability is
held up as evidence of NATO's moral superiority.
</P>
<P>
   At the Supreme Headquarters Allied Powers Europe (SHAPE), one of
Clark's aides, Major Rick Jones, acknowledged, ``General Clark
doesn't do anything unilaterally.'' But Jones insisted that such
accountability is not a liability but ``an excellent example of
what democracy can be.''
</P>
<P>
   Major Jan Joosten, a NATO officer in Macedonia, where some
12,000 NATO forces are waiting to go into Kosovo to implement the
peace plan Milosevic rejects as a violation of Serbian sovereignty,
said Milosevic has it easier in prosecuting a war.
</P>
<P>
   ``We come from 19 different democracies with 19 different points
of view,'' said Joosten, a Dutch officer. ``We are accountable to
our political masters, and they are accountable to 19 different
leaders, who are accountable to 19 different electorates.
Everything we do has to be debated by 19 countries. When Milosevic
wants to do something, he just does it.''
</P>
<P>
   Keith Williams of the North Atlantic Assembly, which advises
NATO in an unofficial capacity, said in theory there must be
unanimity among NATO members before the commanders can act, but in
practice countries that oppose certain tactics often abstain.
</P>
<P>
   ``Countries will not oppose, they'll let it go by. It's rather
subtle,'' said Williams. ``Technically, if Italy or Greece were to
oppose the bombing, it would cease to be a NATO operation.''
</P>
<P>
   As in any coalition or political alliance, there is
scorekeeping. The Greeks, for example, are expected to seek some
form of payback for acquiescing to the attacks on their fellow
Orthodox Christians in Serbia.
</P>
<P>
   The Italians have also expressed reservations about the air
strikes, which are launched by mostly American pilots using Italian
airbases. Some think it is no coincidence that an Italian officer,
Gen. Giuseppe Marani, has emerged as the chief NATO military
spokesman at daily briefings in Brussels.
</P>
<P>
   Initially, NATO's gathering was to have been a celebration. But
the war in Yugoslavia has dramatically reshaped the Washington
conference into more of a strategy session. For example, Friday's
commemorative ceremony was scheduled to last four to five hours. It
has been trimmed back to just over an hour. Instead, there will be
more strategic meetings.
</P>
<P>
   Before leaving for Washington Wednesday, Alastair Campbell,
Blair's press secretary, agreed the summit had been transformed
from celebration to strategy session _ with all the difficulties of
reaching consensus among 19 very different countries.
</P>
<P>
   Campbell, however, refused to be drawn into suggestions that
Blair will try to persuade Clinton that the threat of ground forces
has to be built up quickly, and used if Milosevic doesn't back down
soon.
</P>
<P>
   ``One of the advantages that Milosevic has is that he doesn't
have to discuss any of this publicly,'' Campbell said. ``What you
will see at the Washington summit is the leaders of the NATO
alliance gathering to discuss all of these questions, us being very
open about those discussions and explaining the background to them.
But I think it is probably sensible that we let them do that
first.''

NO IMMEDIATE EFFECT SEEN IN BOMBING OF YUGOSLAV OIL   RESOURCES 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By FRED KAPLAN  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ To hear US and NATO officials talk in recent days,
the crucial element in the air war against Serb leader Slobodan
Milosevic is the attempt to destroy his oil.
</P>
<P>
   NATO spokesman Jamie P. Shea, noting Napoleon's dictum that an
army marches on its stomach, said this week that the motorized army
of today ``marches on its oil reserves.''
</P>
<P>
   More than 20 oil sites have been bombed, in some cases
repeatedly, since the war began a month ago. NATO briefers say
Serbia's oil refineries have been virtually wiped out, and a
quarter of its oil storage tanks have been destroyed.
</P>
<P>
   However, several analysts argue that this aspect of the bombing
has had no visible effect on Milosevic _ and isn't likely to for a
long time.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's grasping at straws,'' said Eliot A. Cohen, professor of
strategic studies at Johns Hopkins University's School for Advanced
International Studies and the director of the US Air Force's
official, five-volume study of the 1991 air war against Iraq.
</P>
<P>
   ``Attacking oil targets has worked only when the other guy has
to consume a lot of oil to do what he's doing,'' Cohen said.
</P>
<P>
   Since Serbian troops are not moving very much, they do not
require much fuel. Much of what they do need can be diverted from
the civilian economy. Oil has also been obtained from tankers
offloading on the Adriatic ports of sister republic Montenegro.
</P>
<P>
   In the past few days, US officials have been urging the NATO
allies to approve some kind of blockade against these ships, but to
no avail thus far. It is a topic that will be discussed at the NATO
meeting this weekend.
</P>
<P>
   Even if tankers can be cut off, one senior administration
official said, the Serb military currently has on hand ``several
weeks'' of fuel if they move around a fair amount _ ``a few months'
'' worth if they don't.
</P>
<P>
   The idea of attacking oil facilities has been a central feature
of US Air Force doctrine since World War II, when Allied bombers
staged thousands of air raids on Nazi oil fields and refineries. At
the end of the war, 1,200 Nazi panzer tanks, which had massed to
push back a Russian offensive, rolled to a halt because they ran
out of fuel.
</P>
<P>
   However, the US Strategic Bombing Survey, an official Allied
study conducted after the war, concluded that the bombing was
effective because it was combined with pressure from ground troops.
A major source of fuel, the Ploesti oil fields in Romania, was
bombed ferociously for a year _ but with ``only limited effects,''
the survey concluded, because the Nazis were able to repair much of
the damage. The turning point did not come until the Soviet Army
overran and occupied the fields.
</P>
<P>
   Pentagon and NATO briefers have said this week that the attacks
on oil in this war have started to strain the movements of Serbian
forces.
</P>
<P>
   However, these same briefers say that Serbian troops continue to
move in and out of Kosovo, and that their number, inside and around
its borders, has grown from 35,000 to 43,000.
</P>
<P>
   Paramilitary troops, who do not require much fuel, also continue
to raid Kosovar villages. Army troops have even managed a couple of
incursions across the Albanian border.
</P>
<P>
   To some NATO officials, however, the real purpose of bombing oil
is to disrupt not the Serbian military but rather the system that
keeps Milosevic in power.
</P>
<P>
   In recent years, the US Air Force has adopted a doctrine of
``parallel warfare,'' which sees an enemy's society as an
interlocking set of ``rings.'' The center and most vital ring is
the leadership. The second ring is the infrastructure _ roads,
bridges, rail lines. Then comes civilian industries, and, finally,
the troops in the field.
</P>
<P>
   The idea of parallel warfare is to destroy the key points that
link these rings together, with the ultimate aim of shattering the
center ring. Oil is one of those links.
</P>
<P>
   However, Cohen does not see the current bombing as a good
example of parallel warfare. ``It's not massive enough,'' he said.
``You have to knock out Serbian television, their electrical power,
all kinds of things, the first night. What they've done here is a
fraction of the Gulf War. It hasn't been a very ferocious air
campaign.''
</P>
<P>
   Some NATO officials have a more indirect view of how to pressure
Milosevic. They note that Serbia's oil refineries _ as well as
various factories that have been bombed _ are owned by Milosevic's
friends and relatives, who, angered at seeing their assets blown
up, might push Milosevic to give up his aims in Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   By the same token, this theory goes, airstrikes on Serbian
military headquarters will drive a wedge between Milosevic and his
general staff.
</P>
<P>
   British defense secretary George Robertson said Wednesday,
``There are clear indications that military commanders, and some
high in the civil world, are not happy about what is happening and
see only defeat on the horizon.''
</P>
<P>
   However, Cohen is skeptical of this notion. ``NATO's doing the
bombing,'' he said. ``Why should Milosevic's cronies get mad at
him?''

ESSAY: CELEBRATING DEFEAT 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By WILLIAM SAFIRE   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Manhole covers are being sealed and sharpshooters
are preparing to patrol rooftops as this capital braces for the
biggest turnout of world leaders since the Kennedy funeral.
</P>
<P>
   The 19 nations of the Atlantic alliance had planned to celebrate
the 50th anniversary of the military organization that stopped the
Russians. Instead, they will be marking their failure to stop
Serbia from expelling unwanted Albanians from its province of
Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   Nobody at NATO will concede defeat. Beribboned briefers use
laser pointers to show bridges destroyed, oil refineries destroyed
and empty barracks blown up _ as if bombing from a safe distance
had anything to do with NATO's military mission.
</P>
<P>
   That was not to ``degrade'' anything but to stop the Serbs from
emptying Kosovo. Threats of bombing failed; actual bombing failed;
no matter what pictures of devastation are shown on television
screens, nobody can credibly deny that NATO is failing in its
primary mission. The Serbs have almost finished doing the bloody
work they set out to do.
</P>
<P>
   That is military defeat. If unreversed, it means the end of NATO
and a new century of ethnic war. Punishment from the air,
calibrated to hurt but not too much, is not enough to win the war.
The way to free Kosovo is to send in men with guns to force out the
men with guns now doing the killing.
</P>
<P>
   Why are we not even preparing to do that? Diplomats can blame a
miscalculation of Slobodan Milosevic's willingness to gamble all;
buck-passers can find an excuse in the difficulty of getting
consensus from every nation in the alliance on the need to send in
troops; our embarrassed generals can explain that taking the threat
of invasion ``off the table'' emboldened the Serbs.
</P>
<P>
   But in the end, NATO's inability to stop the slaughter and mass
expulsion was caused by the failure of nerve of the president of
the United States. He saw the unfolding carnage, eloquently
articulated the stakes in stopping war criminality, made much of
the need for ``staying the course,'' but then _ when ethnic
cleansing made it starkly plain that he would have to lead the
alliance into a battle costing casualties _ choked.
</P>
<P>
   He is afraid it will be labeled ``Clinton's war.'' Public
opinion, now supporting ground action to stop rapine and mass
murder, could turn against him at the first sight of body bags. And
so he waits for others to push him into taking the military steps
to save refugee lives that NATO credibility and international
morality urgently require. The banner he wants to carry into battle
reads ``60 percent support.''
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Congress has done nothing to get our commander in
chief to do his duty to lead. Too many Republicans like the notion
of ``Clinton's war,'' anticipating public disapproval of
ignominious defeat or of costly victory. Too many Democrats with
memories of Vietnam and no recollection of World War II are still
mired in quags.
</P>
<P>
   Not all in Congress are shrouding themselves in ambiguity on
Topic A. This week Sen. John McCain, credentialed by suffering in
war and joined by three Democrats and three Republicans, offered a
resolution spelling out the mission _ Serbian withdrawal and the
return of refugees under NATO-led long-term protection _ and
authorizing ``all necessary force'' to accomplish it.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know,'' said McCain, getting to the heart of the cause of
Clinton's vacillation, ``as should anyone who votes for this
resolution, that if Americans die in a land war with Serbia, we
will bear a considerable share of the blame for their loss. We are
as accountable to their families as the president must be.''
</P>
<P>
   That's a tough vote, but one necessary to strengthen a president
loath to assume ``the awful burden'' by himself. The key NATO
leaders assembling here know that with Clinton's hands frozen on
the wheel in this storm, McCain has for weeks been the de facto
president of the United States, providing leadership, accepting
responsibility.
</P>
<P>
   The Senate should not flinch from debating and passing the
McCain Seven's ``all necessary force'' resolution. The alliance
should use a powerful infantry presence on Serbia's borders to
threaten invasion on more than one front. If no Kosovo withdrawal
ensues, let NATO be NATO.

U.S. WILL BE SET FOR Y2K BUT LOCALITIES MAY NOT BE, OFFICIAL SAYS 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By MATTHEW L. WALD   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Nearly all the federal government's computers will
be ready for the year 2000, and so will those of most states, but
those of some local governments and small businesses will not be,
the official supervising computer preparation for 2000 said
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   The official, John Koskinen, chairman of the President's Council
on Year 2000 Conversion, also predicted that some hospitals and
other health care providers could run into financial trouble that
could force them to close because their billing and reimbursement
systems will not work.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some of those institutions are going to in fact run out of
money and shut down if they can't get their financial systems and
patient-care records fixed,'' Koskinen predicted, in a briefing
summarizing progress.
</P>
<P>
   But, he said, few medical devices that use computers would fail,
because their operation does not depend on the date.
</P>
<P>
   Koskinen added that he was still considering whether to
recommend paying in December some federal benefits that normally
would be due in January. This would have income tax consequences
that some recipients would not like, he said, and the billions of
dollars of payments could disrupt the federal budget.
</P>
<P>
   Many computer systems were programmed to record years in only
two digits, and will assume that the year after 1999 is 1900, with
many unhappy consequences. Koskinen announced last month that 92
percent of the federal government's most important computers were
ready for 2000. Wednesday's briefing included predictions of what
would be accomplished by the end of the year and assessments of the
economy sector by sector.
</P>
<P>
   The government has gathered a lot of data about the preparedness
of the private sector, but mostly on the condition that it not
identify individual companies. It will begin issuing advisories
about foreign countries in the fall.
</P>
<P>
   While the national electric grids, major telephone networks and
other big systems will continue to function, Koskinen said, small
systems may not. He advised mayors and other local leaders to meet
with heads of local utilities, including water and sewer systems,
to determine their state of preparedness. Some leaders of local
governments and companies, he said, plan to wait for January to see
what goes wrong and then fix it.
</P>
<P>
   ``We think it's a high-risk roll of the dice,'' he said, adding
that some small governments might assume that others will come to
their aid. ``Those communities ought not to assume the state is
going to show up everywhere, and certainly shouldn't assume the
federal government is going to show up everywhere.''
</P>
<P>
   In addition, he said, ``there are probably going to be half a
dozen to eight states that are moving too slowly'' and will not be
ready.
</P>
<P>
   He also said that emergency services, including 911 systems,
showed a wide disparity in readiness, and that some smaller
airports were lagging behind in checking computer-operated systems,
including those for security and landing lights.
</P>
<P>
   Some experts have recommended declaring Monday, Jan. 3, Monday,
a federal holiday to give businesses and governments an extra day
to make sure systems work. But Koskinen said that move would
require banks and other financial institutions, most of which have
just finished preparing for 2000, to reprogram again to observe the
holiday. Koskinen said he would advise President Clinton that the
New Year's holiday observed by the federal government should remain
Jan. 1, a Saturday.

SUNBEAM REPORTS $898 MILLION LOSS FOR YEAR 
</HEADLINE>
  (bl) 
 By DANA CANEDY   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Sunbeam Corp., still struggling with the effects of excessive
inventories and heavy debt, turned in another round of dismal
financial results Wednesday, including an $898 million loss for
1998.
</P>
<P>
   Sunbeam, the beleaguered small-appliance maker, has been trying
for nearly a year to unload warehouses full of unsold electric
blankets and barbecue grills as current management tries to clean
up the mess left by Albert Dunlap, whom the board ousted last June
as chairman and chief executive when the company virtually imploded
and its stock collapsed.
</P>
<P>
   The results released Wednesday confirmed that the housecleaning
continues.
</P>
<P>
   In its fourth quarter, Sunbeam lost $311 million, or $3.09 a
diluted share, compared with net income of $9.5 million, or 11
cents a share, in the quarter a year earlier. Revenue rose to $515
million from $262 million, but excluding sales generated by
businesses that Sunbeam bought last year, sales declined to $223
million.
</P>
<P>
   For the full year, Sunbeam lost $898 million, or $9.25 a diluted
share, compared with net income of $38 million in 1997, or 44 cents
a share. Revenue for the year increased to $1.8 billion from $1.1
billion. Excluding sales from the acquired businesses, however,
sales declined to $828 million.
</P>
<P>
   Results for the quarter and year were dragged down by numerous
one-time charges, including some related to the inventory problem,
which the company said would linger into 1999.
</P>
<P>
   ``Although the company incurred large losses for the quarter and
full year, they included substantial non-recurring and unusual
items, as well as the continuing effects of working down excess
inventories,'' said Jerry Levin, who replaced Dunlap as chairman
and chief executive.
</P>
<P>
   Shares of Sunbeam fell 18.75 cents Wednesday, to $5.375. They
traded as high as $31 last April.
</P>
<P>
   Besides the effect of the bloated inventory, Sunbeam was also
hit by vastly higher interest expenses. They soared to $131 million
from just $11 million in the previous year primarily because of
higher borrowing levels in 1998 to finance acquisitions and to
increase working capital.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts said that while current management seemed to have
adequately assessed Sunbeam's problems and was working through
them, it was still too early to say whether the company would fully
recover.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is no way at this early stage to issue a report card,''
said David Leibowitz, an analyst with Burnham Securities. ``Let's
revisit the issue three or four quarters from now when we at least
have the turnaround of '99 already reported and the outlook for
2000 better clarified.''

BEDECK YOUR BACK YARD WITH A CUSTOM BRICK PATIO
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By GAILE ROBINSON 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Laying a brick patio without mortar easy. Sort of. The skill
level needed is fairly basic, but the amount of sweat expressed is
enormous. Still, adding a brick patio to your home can enhance its
value and give you a beautiful surface that will last for decades.
</P>
<P>
   TOOLS NEEDED:
</P>
<P>
   Flat shovel
</P>
<P>
   Wheelbarrow
</P>
<P>
   Garden hose with fine spray nozzle
</P>
<P>
   Hard garden rake
</P>
<P>
   Broad-blade chisel, brick splitter or masonry saw for cutting
and fitting the brick (both are available for rent at local rental
stores or brick distributors)
</P>
<P>
   Carpenter's level
</P>
<P>
   Wood screed strip _ a 2-by-4, at least 3 feet long, raised on
side rails to a height of 1 inch (used to create a uniform sand-bed
depth)
</P>
<P>
   Electric drill and appropriate-size bit (for wood edge only)
</P>
<P>
   Trowel
</P>
<P>
   Broom
</P>
<P>
   Plate compactor
</P>
<P>
   MATERIALS NEEDED:
</P>
<P>
   Bricks. To determine the number needed, calculate the square
footage of your planned patio by multiplying the length by the
width.
</P>
<P>
   Pavers come in three standard sizes: 4-by-8-inch pavers (you'll
need 4.5 per square foot); 3 5/8-by-7 5/8-inch pavers (you'll need
5.2 per square foot); and 3 3/4-by-7 1/2-inch pavers (you'll need
5.1 per square foot). Add 5 percent extra for chipping or breakage,
and 1 1/2 bricks per linear foot for cutting.
</P>
<P>
   Example: For a 10-by-20-foot patio, 200 square feet x 4.5 pavers
900 pavers. An additional 5 percent would be 45 pavers, and 60
linear feet (10 \+ 10 \+ 20 \+ 20) x 1.5 90 pavers. The total
number needed: 900 \+ 45 \+ 90 1,035 pavers.
</P>
<P>
   Sand and crushed stone. These are measured in cubic yards (1
cubic yard equals 27 cubic feet). You'll need to lay 1 inch of
sand. To determine the number of cubic yards of sand, multiply the
square footage by 0.00309. Example: For a 200-square-foot patio,
200 x 0.00309 0.62 cubic yards of sand.
</P>
<P>
   For the base of your patio, you'll need 4 inches of crushed
stone. Multiply the square footage by 0.01235. Example: For a
200-square-foot patio, 200 x 0.01235 2.47 cubic yards of crushed
stone.
</P>
<P>
   BORDER OR EDGING MATERIALS
</P>
<P>
   1. Brick
</P>
<P>
   2. Rigid plastic or metal specifically intended as edging
material
</P>
<P>
   3. Wood 2-by-4 or 4-by-4, pressure-treated or natural redwood
(for wood, metal or rigid plastic, you will need metal spikes that
are at least 8 inches long)
</P>
<P>
   String and wooden stakes (for aligning brickwork)
</P>
<P>
   PREPARING THE AREA
</P>
<P>
   1. Check with your local utility companies to determine the
location of underground lines. You don't want the gas company
digging up your patio at some later date.
</P>
<P>
   2. Check for proper drainage. There should be a
1/4-inch-per-foot slope away from foundations or other permanent
structures.
</P>
<P>
   3. Outline the area with stakes and string, making sure to
include the width of your edging material.
</P>
<P>
   4. Use a flat shovel to remove only enough sod or dirt to
provide a flat, level surface upon which to place the crushed-stone
base. Excess soil that is reinstalled must be firmly settled with a
plate compactor for an even, solid base.
</P>
<P>
   INSTALLING THE BASE
</P>
<P>
   1. Once the sod has been removed and any additional soil has
been compacted, place the crushed stone into the excavation. Using
the plate compactor, tamp down 4 inches of crushed rock. If this is
not done carefully and thoroughly, at an even depth, the bricks
will move over time.
</P>
<P>
   2. The base material should be slightly damp when compacting.
</P>
<P>
   FRAMING THE BORDERS
</P>
<P>
   1. The border, or edging system, is necessary to ensure that the
bricks remain firmly in place. Begin by installing, but not
anchoring, your edging.
</P>
<P>
   2. Once you are satisfied with the placement, anchor the edging
by driving spikes at least 8 inches into the base every 2 to 3
feet. For wood edging, drill holes and drive the spikes through the
middle of the wood. For brick edging, dig a trench deep enough so
that the top edge will be flush with the patio surface.
</P>
<P>
   3. One border can remain unanchored until final brick
installation to ensure a tight fit.
</P>
<P>
   INSTALLING THE SAND BED
</P>
<P>
   1. Dampen the sand with a fine mist of water to remove any
pockets.
</P>
<P>
   2. Place screed over crushed rock. Fill area between screed
rails with sand. Pull the screed over the sand to ensure a uniform
1-inch depth. Be careful not to walk on or disturb the leveled
sand. Move screed and repeat process.
</P>
<P>
   3. Remove the screed rails and fill the indentations with loose
sand. Level with a broom or trowel.
</P>
<P>
   LAYING BRICK PAVERS
</P>
<P>
   1. Start at a corner _ if possible, one that includes an edge,
such as a house, sidewalk or curb. Lay one run of bricks from the
corner along the two intersecting edges (Figure B). Simply set the
bricks on the sand; don't press or hammer them into place. They
should fit snugly, with a gap of 1//16 inch to 1//8 inch between
each brick. Work from the laid bricks, not from the sand side. If
you disturb the sand, relevel it with a broom or trowel before
laying more bricks.
</P>
<P>
   2. Continue to lay bricks, working from your starting corner to
the unanchored edge (Figure C). With the first run of bricks as a
reference, put a string line across the front of your laying edge
(every 2-3 feet) to maintain alignment (Figure D). If the pattern
wanders somewhat, a trowel, screwdriver, or wide-blade putty knife
can be used to make small adjustments.
</P>
<P>
   3. Check the level and alignment of the brickwork frequently
during installation.
</P>
<P>
   4. Once all the whole bricks have been installed up to the final
unanchored edge, cut or saw the remaining bricks to complete the
pattern.
</P>
<P>
   5. Anchor the final border.
</P>
<P>
   FINISHING UP
</P>
<P>
   1. Inspect your work, making final adjustments in brick height
and joint alignment. Sweep dry sand into all the joints to lock the
brick into place.
</P>
<P>
   2. To further set the bricks, you may want to use the plate
compactor to tamp them down gently. If a compactor is used, spread
a layer of sand over your pavers to prevent contact between the
bricks and the compactor.
</P>
<P>
   3. The sand you sweep into the joints will gradually settle. You
should sweep additional sand into the joints as necessary after the
next few rainstorms until the bricks are fully stabilized.
</P>
<P>

For a more detailed brochure with a variety of brick patterns, send
$1 and a stamped, self-addressed envelope to Brick Industries of
America, 11490 Commerce Park Drive, Reston, VA 20191.
</P>
<P>
   If you read the instructions and decide the math and the digging
are WAY too much trouble, check the Yellow Pages under ``Masons''
to locate professionals.

WITH A NEW TIGER HABITAT, THE DALLAS ZOO HOPES TO RIVAL FORT WORTH
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By GRACIE BONDS STAPLES 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   DALLAS _ Rich Buickerood is pumped.
</P>
<P>
   One moment he touts the Dallas Zoo's recent growth spurt, the
next he pounds his chest like Tarzan.
</P>
<P>
   Follow the director's finger as he peers through a window of one
of two buildings that make up the zoo's new Thai Village. There
before him is more than an acre of lush rain forest with heated
rocks, shrubs, exotic grasses and pools of water. This is the Exxon
Endangered Tiger Habitat, where Sasha and Paul, Sumatran tigers
from the Belle Isle Zoo in Detroit, will make their home next
month.
</P>
<P>
   It is also one of two new showplaces _ the other is the new
Children's Zoo, scheduled to open in 2000 _ that the Dallas Zoo is
counting on to help propel it into the national spotlight.
</P>
<P>
   After years in the shadow of its counterpart in Fort Worth _ and
after nearly closing seven years ago _ the Dallas park may be on
its way to becoming one of the finest zoos in the country.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Metroplex has two major cities, and there is no reason in
the world why we can't have two major zoos,'' said Buickerood, who
joined the zoo in 1992. ``There's no reason why we both can't be
successful. We think we're at the stage where we are a very good
zoo, and we've got plans to make us even better.''
</P>
<P>
   The tiger habitat, scheduled to open May 8, is the first major
animal exhibit in the Dallas Zoo's ZooNorth section in 25 years. It
also means that, for the first time in its 111-year history, the
zoo can breed the endangered species.
</P>
<P>
   The habitat, Buickerood said, is a nationally sanctioned
facility designed to bring new hope for the tigers through careful
breeding and public education. Because of habitat loss and
poaching, only 5,000 tigers remain in the wild. Officials estimate
that only about 20 zoos in the country have tiger breeding
programs; of those, six have Sumatran tigers.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a great exhibit,'' Buickerood said. ``We can breed the
tigers, and I've got all sorts of room to breed other tigers.''
</P>
<P>
   VIEW AT THE ZOO
</P>
<P>
   The Dallas Zoo spreads over 110 acres. About 95 have been
developed, and signs of growth and expansion are everywhere.
</P>
<P>
   The tiger habitat, for instance, is just across from Primate
Place, the first component of the $4.5 million Exxon exhibit, which
opened in August. The year before that, the $1.9 million,
19,000-square-foot Kimberly Clark Chimpanzee Forest in the Wilds of
Africa opened. And the year before that, officials unveiled the
Lemur Lookout, the featured attraction at the grand opening of the
$4 million entry complex, which includes a new entrance directly
off Interstate 35, parking areas, an entry plaza and a 67
1/2-foot-tall giraffe sculpture.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were dealing with 200,000 cars a day on I-35 going by us
and people not knowing we were here,'' Buickerood said. ``I knew we
needed an icon, and we came up the giraffe everyone knows now.
Everybody talks about it, takes pictures of it. We knew we couldn't
move the zoo, so we moved the entrance.''
</P>
<P>
   Instead of entering the complex on the north at Clarendon Drive,
patrons can access the zoo at Marsalis Avenue right off the
interstate.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, Dallas Area Rapid Transit opened a light-rail
station just across the street, which makes it easier for patrons
to find the zoo.
</P>
<P>
   Plans are under way for an indoor restaurant that will overlook
the tiger exhibit and a 4-acre, $7 million children's zoo. It will
feature a bubbling fountain called Raccoon Springs, where children
can wash their hands; an outdoor amphitheater for live wildlife
presentations; a wandering stream where children can get wet as
they play; and a farm where children can interact with goats,
guinea pigs, ducks and chickens.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you discount the horrible summer we had last year,'' said
Buickerood, ``we really blossomed when access was better. Seventeen
to 18 percent of visitors are coming by train, and the number of
people by car has increased 40 percent over the last four years.
We're thrilled by the public's response to all the changes.''
</P>
<P>
   GROUNDS FOR PRAISE
</P>
<P>
   Charlie King is certainly impressed.
</P>
<P>
   As schoolchildren, parents, grandparents and toddlers in
strollers milled about, the zoo visitor from Richmond, Va., offered
this cursory impression:
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it's phenomenal. I just came through the African
exhibit. If I were an animal, I wouldn't mind living here. The
habitats are very natural. I'm real impressed with this.''
</P>
<P>
   So is Lanita Roomiani, who was with a group of fifth-graders
from Dover Elementary in Richardson.
</P>
<P>
   She said that she hadn't been to the zoo in years, but that ``it
looks nicer.''
</P>
<P>
   Todd Maki and Sprina Liu, animal keepers at Zoo Atlanta, were
making special note of the park's lush grounds. Because the
vegetation at Zoo Atlanta is beginning to wear down from overeating
and browsing, Maki and Liu were in Dallas to talk to zoo
horticulturists for restoration tips.
</P>
<P>
   Even Buickerood will admit that seven years ago, Dallas' zoo was
in pretty bad shape. It couldn't add any exhibits or market itself.
</P>
<P>
   ``This place was stinko,'' he said. ``We really thought we were
in trouble.''
</P>
<P>
   With the city in an economic drought, Buickerood suggested
closing the park.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's when we got everybody's attention,'' he said. ``The zoo
society stepped up support, as did the Parks Department. There was
also an outpouring of support from the public and, quite frankly,
it was good for us that the Fort Worth Zoo was enjoying such good
success.''
</P>
<P>
   Before management of the Fort Worth Zoo was turned over to the
Fort Worth Zoological Association in 1991, Dallas was considered
the better of the two parks. Dallas had opened its much-touted
Wilds of Africa exhibit, which included a monorail ride, and for a
time was drawing good crowds.
</P>
<P>
   But support from the Fort Worth association and some of its
wealthy members quickly moved the Fort Worth zoo into major-league
status. Since then, individuals, foundations and corporations have
contributed more than $25 million to upgrade exhibits and add the
kind of polish that most city-run zoos cannot afford.
</P>
<P>
   With Dallas recommitted to its zoo, the park's budget has grown
from $6 million to $9 million over the past five years. The
zoological society has also increased its support.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're pretty contented cows right now,'' Buickerood said. ``We
started to see a turnaround in 1994, and it's just been straight
uphill ever since. There's been nothing but positive things
happening out here for the last several years, and I see nonstop
construction for another decade.''

INDIA'S PARTIES GROPE FOR WAY TO FORM NEW GOVERNMENT 
</HEADLINE>
  (bl) 
 By CELIA W. DUGGER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW DELHI, India _ A diverse, bickering collection of parties
united for long enough in Parliament on Saturday to bring down the
Hindu-nationalist-led government by a single vote. But they are
having a lot more trouble figuring out how to form a new
government.
</P>
<P>
   With great assurance, Sonia Gandhi, the Italian-born heir to
India's political dynasty, declared Wednesday that the Congress
Party, which she leads, would form a government with the
parliamentary support of more than a dozen other parties.
</P>
<P>
   But Wednesday evening the Samajwadi, or Socialist, Party, whose
backing is essential if Congress is to attain its goal, said that
in exchange for its support, it wanted to be part of the new
government. And it suggested that Jyoti Basu, the aging Communist
leader who is considered one of the country's elder statesmen,
should be prime minister.
</P>
<P>
   ``We cannot do without Congress and Congress cannot do without
us,'' said Amar Singh, a leader of the Samajwadi Party, which has
20 votes in Parliament.
</P>
<P>
   The coming days will tell whether the party's position is a
bargaining tactic or a serious threat. After she emerged from a
half-hour meeting with President K.R. Narayanan earlier in the day,
Mrs. Gandhi said she was confident that Congress would win the
Samajwadi Party over.
</P>
<P>
   She said Congress now had the support of 272 members of
Parliament, enough for a bare one-vote majority, and promised that
she would give the president letters from allies to prove it within
two days.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have 272 and we hope to get more,'' she said. ``We are
confident we will get more.''
</P>
<P>
   As the battle for power inches along, the tone of criticism from
members of the Hindu nationalist Bharatiya Janata Party, which
headed the year-old coalition government that collapsed Saturday,
is growing more shrill and bitter.
</P>
<P>
   Passage of the 1999-2000 budget, scheduled for adoption
Wednesday by consensus of all political parties, was delayed
because of disruptive, angry exchanges in Parliament.
</P>
<P>
   Parliament was adjourned four times after irate members of the
Hindu nationalist coalition stormed to the well and shouted that
the Congress Party was trying to lure away the votes of members of
their alliance with unfair ``horse trading.''
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Gandhi replied, ``It is the habit of the BJP to accuse
others of what they have been indulging in.''
</P>
<P>
   Congress Party leaders want Mrs. Gandhi, the widow of one prime
minister, Rajiv Gandhi, and the daughter-in-law of another, Indira
Gandhi, to continue the dynastic reign. But she said Wednesday that
any such decision was premature. ``When the time comes, then we
will see,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Gandhi, who entered politics only a year ago to head the
foundering Congress Party, has had little experience in the
wheeling and dealing that will be required to hold together a new
government. Nor, party officials say, does this very private woman
have a strong appetite for politicking.
</P>
<P>
   But if she makes the leap now, she can expect the Hindu
nationalists to use her foreign birth against her. A Catholic from
Italy, she married Rajiv Gandhi in 1968 and became an Indian
citizen in 1986. Her husband was defeated as prime minister in 1989
and assassinated as he campaigned to regain the position in 1991.
</P>
<P>
   Wednesday she got a taste of the hardball strategy. About a
dozen lawmakers from Bharatiya Janata and its allies noisily
gathered outside Parliament chanting: ``Sonia, go back. Rome raj
will not be tolerated.''
</P>
<P>
   If Mrs. Gandhi can deliver the votes to form the government of
her choice _ and that is still far from certain _ the once dominant
Congress Party, in ruinous decline in the last decade, would
reclaim power from its main national rival. The new government
would be India's sixth since 1996.
</P>
<P>
   Many analysts say that such a government, dependent for survival
on a set of regional, leftist and caste-based parties, would be
likely to topple in short order, with the probable result of new
national elections.
</P>
<P>
   The Hindu nationalists led a fractious coalition that came
undone last week and lost a confidence vote on Saturday by a
breathtakingly slim margin of 270- 269. There are 545 seats in the
lower house of Parliament, but with two vacant, 272 is for now the
magic number for a majority.
</P>
<P>
   The ousted government shocked the world last May by conducting
underground nuclear tests, which were then matched by Pakistan. In
recent months it has defined itself with steps to try to further
open India's economy to foreign investors, notably in the
government-run insurance industry, and to lower trade barriers, cut
food subsidies to people above the poverty line and start a
dialogue between Prime Minister Atal Behari Vajpayee and Nawaz
Sharif, the prime minister of archrival Pakistan.
</P>
<P>
   The rise of a Congress-led government, heavily dependent on
support from parties on the left, would probably slow down
pro-market economic policies, analysts say.
</P>
<P>
   And U.S. diplomats say a Congress-led government would be much
less likely to sign the nuclear test ban treaty by the September
deadline set more than two years ago by a U.N. conference. Congress
has previously taken the position that India should not sign the
treaty until the major nuclear powers agree to take definite steps
to disarm their own nuclear stockpiles.
</P>
<P>
   Since India conducted its nuclear tests, Foreign Minister
Jaswant Singh and Deputy Secretary of State Strobe Talbott have had
eight rounds of talks that only recently seemed to be heading
towards a successful conclusion, which in U.S. eyes would include
India's signing the treaty.
</P>
<P>
   Singh and Talbott have developed a close rapport in what the
Americans describe as the most sustained high-level talks between
the United States and India since India gained its independence in
1947.
</P>
<P>
   ``We'll have to start all over again, or at least give the new
government a while to sort itself out,'' said one frustrated U.S.
diplomat. ``In the best case it will take several months before we
can get moving.''
</P>
<P>
   Despite Mrs. Gandhi's confident statements Wednesday, it is not
clear who is providing the 272 votes she said she had. The
opposition had only 270 votes Saturday, and two small leftist
parties with 7 of those votes have vowed that they will never
support a Congress-led alliance.
</P>
<P>
   And now the 20 votes of the Samajwadi Party, based in the state
of Uttar Pradesh, are in question. The party sees Congress as a
potential threat to its own vote base among Muslims and Yadavs, the
politically influential cow herders' caste.
</P>
<P>
   The Congress Party may well be counting on defections from the
coalition led by the Hindu nationalists. By Wednesday, two members
of Parliament had switched sides, and a small party from the state
of Kashmir with two votes was hinting that it might support a new
government.
</P>
<P>
   Congress Party spokesman Arjun Singh said Tuesday that the
``migratory birds'' would begin to roost in their new home only
when the voting season arrived.
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Gandhi's confident remarks Wednesday may have been intended
to convince wavering members of Parliament who had been allied with
the Hindu nationalists that they should hitch themselves to a new
winning side. But the Samajwadi Party's defiance of Congress' game
plan exposed the fault lines that may yet crack apart any new
government.

SENATE RACE COULD BE BED OF THORNS FOR HILLARY 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (For release Sunday, April 25)   (EDs: Replaces ``Hillary'' thruout; other edits)  
 Commentary)  
 (For use by New York Times News Service Clients)  
 By ROBERT E. THOMPSON  
 c. 1999 Hearst Newspapers  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ ``I love New York, I always have,'' purred Hillary
Rodham Clinton, delivering what could be the opening line in a
fascinating political drama.
</P>
<P>
   The first lady campaigned last week through the state that next
year will elect a successor to the eminent Sen. Daniel Patrick
Moynihan, a Democrat who is retiring after four terms. Her hope,
presumably, is that she will be that successor.
</P>
<P>
   It is not easy to excite the residents of a state that is
satiated with celebrities from the worlds of sports, theater, high
finance, literature and politics. But Clinton is trying to and
appears to be succeeding, at least with Democrats who want her to
seek Moynihan's seat.
</P>
<P>
   With charm and intelligence, she is paving her own way to a
possible announcement that she will take up residence in New York
and enter the Senate race.
</P>
<P>
   But she is enough of a realist to understand that what could
await her is a bed of thorns rather than a bed of roses.
</P>
<P>
   Having campaigned many times with her husband, she should be
ready for blistering assaults on her character, her credibility,
her role as mother and wife and her part in the many controversial
activities that have gotten her attention.
</P>
<P>
   If she decides to run for the Senate, and if her Republican
opponent is New York Mayor Rudolph Giuliani, Clinton would be
entering the ring against a tough, determined political pugilist
who would not be awed by her status as first lady.
</P>
<P>
   Critics will be scanning a new book, ``The First Partner:
Hillary Rodham Clinton,'' by Joyce Milton and other books for dirt
about the president's wife. Publishers's Weekly describes Milton's
book as ``a revealing and withering portrait.''
</P>
<P>
   In it, Milton probes the first lady's role in questionable
political fund-raising activities as well as her relationship with
a philandering husband who is an adept prevaricator. Milton
suggests a romantic link between Clinton and Vincent W. Foster Jr.,
her onetime law partner who became a White House aide and took his
own life. She also claims that Hillary Clinton declared the White
House off-limits to Barbra Streisand because the president and the
chanteuse allegedly were involved in a bit of hanky-panky.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton has no role model for this adventure because no previous
first lady has sought public office after her husband's White House
tenure came to an end.
</P>
<P>
   The idol with whose spirit Clinton sometimes communes, Eleanor
Roosevelt, made a career of demolishing barriers erected to control
the activities and ambitions of women. Yet she didn't seek elective
office.
</P>
<P>
   After the death of President Franklin D. Roosevelt in 1945,
there were some suggestions that Mrs. Roosevelt might run for
office in her home state of New York.
</P>
<P>
   But nothing came of the idea. Mrs. Roosevelt did play a
prominent role, however, in Democratic Party activities, starting
in 1940 when she flew to the national convention in Chicago to
quell a rebellion against her husband's selection of liberal
Agriculture Secretary Henry A. Wallace as his third-term running
mate.
</P>
<P>
   In the 1950s, she was a strong supporter of Adlai Stevenson for
president. At the 1960 convention, she again urged Stevenson's
nomination, but the prize went to John F. Kennedy.
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Roosevelt's most enduring commitment, following 12 years in
the White House, was to the United Nations. President Harry Truman
appointed her a delegate to the world organization in 1945 and she
served until 1953. Kennedy reappointed her in 1961, but she died
the following year.
</P>
<P>
   Other former first ladies have been active in their post-White
House years, without venturing into political battle as Clinton may
do.
</P>
<P>
   After her second husband, Aristotle Onassis, died, Jacqueline
Kennedy Onassis became a highly-regarded book editor at Doubleday.
Lady Bird Johnson, who made beautification of America a major theme
of her activities as first lady, established, in her post-White
House years, the National Wildlife Research Center in Austin,
Texas.
</P>
<P>
   Betty Ford, who struggled with alcoholism and drug abuse,
established the Betty Ford Clinic to help others overcome their
chemical dependency. Rosalynn Carter has continued since the end of
her husband's presidency to support efforts to help the mentally
ill.
</P>
<P>
   Nancy Reagan and Barbara Bush have made a few public
appearances, but have not taken on major projects.
</P>
<P>
   If Hillary Rodham Clinton accepts the challenge to run for
office in New York, she will be a trailblazer, a pioneer slashing
her way through the Empire State's tangled political thicket.
</P>
<P>
   She told reporters in New York last week that ``right now I am
very focused on the situation in Kosovo.'' She is ready to visit
the area at the invitation of the U.S. Agency for International
Development.
</P>
<P>
   The first lady added: ``I think it is very important for me to
go to Kosovo eventually, but I want to go when my going does not
interfere with the work and in any way displace resources.''
</P>
<P>
   Such a journey could add to her prestige and strengthen her
political credentials. That other female political pathfinder,
Elizabeth Dole, must have seen similar advantage in such a journey
when she visited the Balkans and returned recently to proclaim that
the war must be won.

THERE'S SOMETHING TO BE SAID FOR LOW-BROW COMEDY
</HEADLINE>
 -LADN (For use Friday, April 23 by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By GLENN WHIPP  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ David Spade's new comedy, the sporadically funny
``Lost and Found,'' contains what may be the best dog poop visual
gag in recent film history. Whether you think this sounds appealing
or repulsive has everything to do with your decision to see this
movie.
</P>
<P>
   Borrowing its tone (and its cute little dog) from ``There's
Something About Mary,'' ``Lost and Found'' keeps its vulgarity
sweet and sassy, although the jokes are not nearly as inventive as
the Farrelly brothers' brand of warped humor. There are more laughs
than expected in the midst of a predictable plot that has Spade
pursuing French actress Sophie Marceau. If you can buy the
Spade-Marceau pairing, then you're halfway home to liking this
movie.
</P>
<P>
   Spade plays Dylan, co-owner of a failing restaurant and
possessor of some secret magic that makes him irresistible to
women. In the opening scenes, we see his breakup with a cowgirl
stripper. Dylan mourns the relationship for about five minutes
until he bumps into Lila DuBois (Marceau), his new next-door
neighbor. She's from Paris, plays the cello and owns an adorable
terrier that likes to roam away from home.
</P>
<P>
   Dylan is instantly smitten and tries to charm Lila, but can't
get her alone. So he kidnaps her dog, figuring it's a good excuse
to spend some quality time together searching for the pooch. Mix in
a lost diamond ring that the dog may have swallowed, a handsome and
meddlesome ex-boyfriend (Patrick Bruel) determined to take Lila
back to France, and a rousing stage tribute to Neil Diamond, and
you've got the makings for a low-brow comedy that will easily amuse
the undiscriminating.
</P>
<P>
   Director Jeff Pollack (``Booty Call''), working from a script by
Spade, B.B. Cook and Marc Meeks, keeps things moving briskly. Jon
Lovitz shows up in a funny cameo as a ``dog whisperer'' and there
are brief, enjoyable appearances from Estelle Harris, Rose Marie,
Marla Gibbs and Carol Cook as a flatulent group of women who like a
good game of strip poker. Also on hand: ``Mad TV's'' Artie Shaw,
funny as a Chris Farley-like sidekick. (Lovitz: ``I see large and
small. Where's the medium?''
</P>
<P>
   Because of the romantic plot, Spade smirks less than usual,
which makes the prospect of spending an hour and a half with him
much more palatable. The script isn't smart enough to give Marceau
much to do besides smile and look great, but she doesn't seem to
mind being here. Neither will you if you're looking for something
lame-brained and light. &QL;

BAUER INVOKES COLORADO MASSACRE IN ANNOUNCING RUN FOR PRESIDENCY  
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Ky., Colo., Ohio, Ind., Okla.)  (rk) 
 By FRANK BRUNI   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEWPORT, Ky. _ Invoking the deadly shootings at a school in
Colorado as the agonizing measure of a country that had lost its
moral bearings, Gary L. Bauer announced his candidacy for the
Republican presidential nomination Wednesday and pledged to put
America back on a righteous track.
</P>
<P>
   ``The culture glorifies death in a thousand different ways,''
Bauer told an audience of about 900 people, including hundreds of
students, at the high school he once attended in this dowdy
working-class suburb of Cincinnati. ``We've got movies and music
and television shows that show people dying as if it were something
that was as simple as the sun coming up in the morning.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the America I want,'' he continued, his voice rising in
pitch and fervor, ``those Hollywood producers and directors _ they
wouldn't be able to show their faces in public, because you and
every other American would point to them and say, `Shame! Shame!
Shame!' ''
</P>
<P>
   Bauer, a religious conservative on leave from his post as
president of the Family Research Council, had prepared a speech
that gave moral and social issues little more attention than tax
cutting and foreign policy. But he said the deaths in Littleton,
Colo., on Tuesday compelled a narrower focus and a more urgent
tone.
</P>
<P>
   His almost single-minded emphasis on morality in Wednesday's
speech underscored questions about whether Bauer, a long shot for
the Republican nomination by any pollster's calculations, joined a
crowded field as a truly viable contender with ideas on diverse
subjects or a protest candidate trying to hold other Republicans'
feet to a conservative fire.
</P>
<P>
   Bauer, for example, made it clear that he could brook no
equivocation on the matter of abortion, legalized more than a
quarter century ago by a Supreme Court decision that he said
``really boils down to one simple and profoundly evil idea. They
said that our unborn children have no rights.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't care what the polls say,'' Bauer said. ``I will never
sacrifice one American child, born or unborn. You can count on
it.'' At that, his listeners rose to their feet, as they did
several times during his impassioned remarks, with a roar of
approval and a sustained round of applause.
</P>
<P>
   Although other candidates for the Republican nomination like Dan
Quayle and Pat Buchanan have also put themselves forward as social
conservatives, Bauer Wednesday cast himself as the true standard
bearer.
</P>
<P>
   But he comes to presidential politics without any experience in
elective office. Bauer served as domestic policy adviser to
President Reagan in the 1980s and subsequently built the Family
Research Council, an advocacy group on the front lines of the
opposition to abortion and gay rights, into a rich, potent
political organization whose officers are widely quoted.
</P>
<P>
   The group's large mailing list has given Bauer a built-in base
of supporters and donors. Indeed, many of the people at his
announcement Wednesday said they had become familiar with Bauer
through their involvement with the council.
</P>
<P>
   John C. Green, a political scientist at the University of Akron
who studies religious conservatives, said that the council's base
could yield enough volunteers and small contributions to give
Bauer's candidacy some zest in the early primaries.
</P>
<P>
   ``He has a lot of resources,'' Green said. ``In a crowded field,
he could finish second or third.''
</P>
<P>
   But Green said that Bauer's appeal was ultimately limited even
among religious conservatives, many of whom care most about picking
a Republican who can go the distance to the White House. ``I think
many of these pragmatists are convinced that if Pat Robertson
couldn't win the nomination, Gary Bauer can't,'' Green said.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Bauer did not get any break in the timing of Wednesday's
announcement, eclipsed by news of both the military operations in
Kosovo and the Colorado shootings. His situation called to mind the
misfortune four years ago of Sen. Richard Lugar, R-Ind., who
announced his candidacy on the day that a bomb ripped apart the
federal building in Oklahoma City.
</P>
<P>
   Bauer sought to tailor his speech to this newly altered context
and found more verve in these spontaneous comments than in the
prepared remarks his aides had distributed a day earlier.
</P>
<P>
   He complained that America's robustness was too often gauged by
the size of its military or the dizzying heights of the stock
market. ``But you can also measure a nation by how many of its
families are broken, how big its virtue deficit is, how many of its
children cry themselves to sleep at night,'' Bauer said.
</P>
<P>
   Standing in a gymnasium where the campaign placards and bunting
were no more conspicuous than two giant electronic scoreboards,
Bauer set himself apart from the moneyed, glitzy cliques who he
said often held sway over politics and popular culture.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are too many people in the elites of America _ in
Hollywood and on Wall Street and in Washington, D.C. _ too many
people that have forgotten that our liberty comes from God, not
from any man,'' Bauer told the crowd.
</P>
<P>
   After the speech, he tried to clarify for reporters the precise
connection between that observation and the bloodshed in Colorado.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you have a society where you're no longer telling many of
your kids that they're created by God,'' he said, ``that their
liberty comes from him, that virtue matters and death is never an
option, whether it's an unborn baby or settling a fight, I don't
think we can be surprised when we get the kind of horrible pictures
and scenes that we increasingly see.''
</P>
<P>
   Asked if his opposition to more stringent gun control laws had
been shaken, he said it had not, because the problem is not the
availability of weapons but the hearts of those who use them.
</P>
<P>
   Bauer's speech touched only briefly on other parts of his
agenda. He advocates a flat tax of 16 percent with more tax credits
for families with children. He also supports a stronger national
defense, though he has expressed opposition to the American
military involvement in Kosovo, which he said was not certain to
solve the region's endemic conflicts.
</P>
<P>
   In ways direct and indirect, he invoked Reagan, borrowing one of
his campaign anthems and the ``shining city on a hill'' reference
so beloved by the former president.
</P>
<P>
   But at least some of his listeners seemed less interested in
Gary Bauer the Reagan follower or Gary Bauer the tax cutter than in
Gary Bauer the moral crusader.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think he's been called by God,'' said Donald Ochs, 52, the
owner of a company that makes computer parts.
</P>
<P>
   Geri Koch, 72, who described herself as an evangelical
Christian, said that Bauer was the candidate who best articulated
her values. Then she urged her interviewer to take Jesus Christ as
a personal savior.
</P>
<P>
   ``Jesus is the only way to heaven,'' she said.

HOSTILE TONE MAKES `ELECTION' A DOWNER
</HEADLINE>
 (For use Friday, April 23 by NYTimes News Service clients)  
By GLENN WHIPP 
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ A brutal satire about the impact of a hard-fought
student government contest, ``Election'' is smart, often funny and
nearly impossible to like. Writer-director Alexander Payne has
fashioned a complex, knowing look at the vile impulses that lurk
beneath the surface of seemingly nice people, but his movie is so
mean-spirited and full of contempt for humanity that it largely
becomes an exercise in hostility.
</P>
<P>
   The self-defeating movie opens with snarky voice-overs from its
two main characters. Jim McAllister (Matthew Broderick) is a
well-liked student government teacher who has been with Omaha's
George Washington Carver High for 12 years. He drives a beat-up
Ford Fiesta, wears short-sleeve shirts with outdated ties and has a
cold, dispassionate marriage with his wife (``my best friend''),
Diane (Molly Hagan).
</P>
<P>
   Jim's nemesis is Tracy Flick (Reese Witherspoon), a
preternaturally perky overachiever who views high school as the
first step toward world domination. Tracy is running _ unopposed _
for student body president until Mr. McAllister recruits his own
candidate, Paul Metzler (Chris Klein), a popular football hero.
Tracy does not take this development lightly. ``The weak always try
to sabotage the strong,'' she intones ominously.
</P>
<P>
   Is good-natured Jim McAllister weak? Initially, his animosity
toward Tracy seems to stem from his knowledge of her affair with
his best friend and former colleague, Dave Novotny (Mark Harelik).
Knowing she's not quite the ingenue that her image suggests, Jim
sets out to thwart her.
</P>
<P>
   But as ``Election'' moves along and Jim's behavior becomes more
and more erratic, it becomes clear that there's something deeper at
work here. Although he insists everything is fine (the man is in
deep denial, Jim clearly isn't fulfilled by either his wife (he has
a trunk full of porn in the basement and fantasizes about Novotny's
estranged wife) or his job. Thus, when he looks at the industrious
Tracy, he sees his own stagnant life with a new-found clarity.
</P>
<P>
   This is all well and good, but Payne (who, with Jim Taylor,
adapted the screenplay from Tom Perrotta's novel) lets his
stridency get the best of him. Payne grew up in the film's Omaha
and set his other movie, the abortion comedy ``Citizen Ruth,'' here
as well. Judging from the hateful manner in which he portrays every
person in this story and the godawful way he films the
surroundings, the experience must have been a painful one.
</P>
<P>
   If the film was half as insightful as it believes, the shrill
tone would go down a little easier. But too many of the broadsides
here are obvious, including a Monica Lewinsky moment that concludes
the movie.
</P>
<P>
   Even though they are playing complete caricatures, Broderick and
Witherspoon come across fairly well, with Broderick nicely playing
off his ``Ferris Bueller'' high school past. The film's other teen
roles went mostly to unknowns _ Klein's dim-witted Paul; Jessica
Campbell as Paul's angry lesbian sister, Tammy; and Frankie
Ingrassia playing the bisexual Lisa, the object of the siblings'
affections. The newcomers acquit themselves nicely even if their
efforts are ultimately overwhelmed by all the sneering. &QL;

YOUNG ACTRESS HAS BEEN HARD NOT TO NOTICE  &HT;    By BOB STRAUSS 
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Some people overachieve just to get attention.
Reese Witherspoon generates attention without half trying.
</P>
<P>
   In her latest movie, ``Election,'' the 23-year-old actress plays
an ultra-ambitious high school senior, Tracy Flick, who will go to
any lengths to become class president. In real life, Witherspoon
says things like ``I'm only in this for as long as it's still fun,
and then it'll be time to do something else.''
</P>
<P>
   However unintentionally, Witherspoon has managed to create a
stir quite a few times, starting eight years ago with her movie
debut, ``The Man in the Moon.'' Her performance as a lovelorn
pubescent was remarkable for its intelligence and emotional
comprehension; even more so coming from a Nashville teen-ager whose
only previous experience had been in local TV commercials.
</P>
<P>
   The daughter of a doctor and a nursing professor, Witherspoon
concentrated on her education (first at Haspeth Hall, Music City's
toniest all-girl high school, then at Stanford) rather than join
the legion of fast-flaming kid actors in Hollywood. The limited
time she spent working was mostly spent on a handful of carefully
chosen, artistically challenging film projects (Diane Keaton's
``Wildflower,'' the provocative ``Fear'' and ``Freeway'').
</P>
<P>
   Over the last six months, Witherspoon's profile has been on an
ever-rising trajectory. In the widely acclaimed 1998 release
``Pleasantville,'' she was a sexually aggressive '90s girl trapped
in a 1950s sitcom universe. Earlier this year, she switched gears
to play an outspoken virgin in ``Cruel Intentions,'' the
controversial teen version of ``Les Liaisons Dangereuses.''
</P>
<P>
   That film's February release was accompanied by the announcement
that Witherspoon and co-star her boyfriend of two years, were
expecting a baby (they plan to marry before the child's arrival).
</P>
<P>
   Now the satiric ``Election,'' co-starring Matthew Broderick as
an obsessed educator and marked by discussions of student-teacher
sex so raw that it makes ``Never Been Kissed'' seem positively
parochial, is bound to raise a few eyebrows. And the film
Witherspoon is making now will likely raise roofs; it's an
adaptation of Bret Easton Ellis' novel ``American Psycho,'' the
tale of a yuppie serial killer that was published amid a firestorm
of condemnation.
</P>
<P>
   Despite all that, Witherspoon denies any desire for celebrity.
</P>
<P>
   ``As far as being in the spotlight and under public scrutiny, a
lot of that's about how much you put yourself out there,'' says the
actress, a petite blonde whose wide, saucerlike eyes and button
nose enable her to still play convincing teen-agers. ``It's not
like we go to every premiere and every celebrity function and every
charity auction. We really just try to maintain our privacy and
never let our public persona get out of hand.''
</P>
<P>
   If anything, it's her work that sticks in people's minds. When
``Election'' director Alexander Payne was preparing his second
feature (his debut was the similarly taboo-breaking, abortion
conflict farce ``Citizen Ruth''), Witherspoon was one of the first
actresses he approached.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had this weird meeting,'' she recalls. ``Then suddenly, the
next week he offered me the role. He'd only seen `Man in the Moon'
and he was sure I could do it! I didn't want to call him and say,
`That was nine years ago, things have changed a little.' But it
worked out.''
</P>
<P>
   Payne's instincts were sound, according to those who know
Witherspoon. Although she exhibits none of Tracy Flick's delusions
or pretensions, she definitely shares a few personality traits with
the furiously motivated achiever.
</P>
<P>
   ``She's a very smart, well-read, headstrong young woman who
knows what she wants in life and knows what she wants in her
career,'' says ``Intentions'' producer Neal H. Moritz.
</P>
<P>
   ``What I've always found the most attractive about Reese is her
strength; she can handle everything,'' adds Phillippe (``54,'' ``I
Know What You Did Last Summer''). ``Things just roll off her back;
she just knows how to take care of business.''
</P>
<P>
   When she got the ``Election'' job, Witherspoon plunged right in.
She secretly enrolled in an Omaha, Neb., high school like the one
where the film is set.
</P>
<P>
   ``I lasted incognito for about two days, then all the kids
caught on,'' she says with a chuckle. ``But it was great. I had
this great girl that showed me around who was an Omaha cheerleader
and president of the student council. She was such an inspiration
for the character.''
</P>
<P>
   Tracy's darker aspects were informed by different sources:
Witherspoon's fellow Stanford undergrads.
</P>
<P>
   ``College provided the prototype for this kind of person,'' she
says, ``that is so ambitious and so determined to get ahead that
they will do anything and everything to succeed. I met a lot of
those kind of people at Stanford, people who'd worked so hard on
their academic careers and worked so very little on their
socialization.''
</P>
<P>
   But wasn't a Southern girls school upbringing socially retarding
in a different way?
</P>
<P>
   ``Nope, I loved it,'' Witherspoon says without hesitation.
``Loved my uniform, loved not having to compete for male attention,
loved that we were able to focus on our work, loved not having the
drama of relationships in high school _ and it's not like we missed
out on that stuff, we had plenty of it on the weekends.''
</P>
<P>
   Witherspoon will next be seen in a film noir thriller, ``Best
Laid Plans,'' scheduled for a September release. As for the
complaints ``American Psycho'' is sure to generate _ victims-rights
advocates have already petitioned the Toronto city council to
withhold permission to shoot the film there (their request was
denied) _ Witherspoon claims that it will be much ado about not
much.
</P>
<P>
   ``The book is actually really different from the movie,'' she
says. ``The script is not violent at all; there are probably two
rough minutes in the movie, but all the rest of the graphic
violence in the book has been omitted. It's really more of a
satiric look at these young New York socialites in 1987, and how
incredibly materialistic they are.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's really about the loss of the individual to the point
where this guy has no identity and he wants to come out and tell
everyone that he's done these awful murders, but nobody believes
him.''
</P>
<P>
   Sounds intriguing. But you have to ask if impending motherhood
is possibly going to have a bearing on whether or not Witherspoon
will make movies as provocative as ``Election'' and ``Psycho'' in
the future.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know if my tastes will change after I have the baby,''
she admits. ``You just make decisions based on who you are as a
person, but I don't know how that's going to affect me. I'm
definitely happy with the way my career has gone, the success; but
I even feel glad that I've experienced some failure in my life.
That gives you perspective and humility about this business; it's
good to realize that you're always just one movie away from not
being in vogue anymore.''
</P>
<P>
   That's prospect terrifies most actors of any age. But
Witherspoon has other, more serious priorities.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm very excited about the baby,'' she says. ``I realize no
movie can ever be as important as the process and the journey we're
going through now. I think that it's very easy to take time in your
life to work on your career, but it's harder to take time to work
on the quality of your life. But that's sort of what we plan on
doing for the next year.'' &QL;

REGGIE LEWIS JURORS TO HEAR SOME DRUG EVIDENCE, JUDGE RULES 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (a and s coding)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By SACHA PFEIFFER  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON -- A judge has ruled that allegations of illegal drug use
by the late Boston Celtics star Reggie Lewis may be considered as
evidence at an upcoming malpractice trial resulting from his death.
</P>
<P>
   But Superior Court Judge Thayer Fremont-Smith said Wednesday
that jurors will only be able to hear specific allegations if
lawyers for the four doctors Lewis's widow is suing can prove a
connection between Lewis's alleged cocaine use and the doctors'
failure to diagnose the heart condition that killed him.
</P>
<P>
   Lawyers for Lewis's widow, Donna Harris-Lewis, had asked that
any evidence of illicit drug use be barred from the trial,
scheduled to begin next week, arguing that the issue had been
raised ``for the sole purpose of trashing'' Lewis's reputation.
</P>
<P>
   After a hearing Wednesday in Suffolk Superior Court,
Fremont-Smith ruled that evidence of drug use would be relevant
``if it can be proven.''
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Gilbert H. Mudge Jr., the cardiologist who treated Lewis,
said he could not accurately diagnose Lewis's condition because
Lewis withheld information on his cocaine use until two weeks
before he collapsed and died on a basketball court.
</P>
<P>
   Fremont-Smith said he would decide what, if any, evidence of
drug use would be admissible on a case-by-case basis during the
trial.
</P>
<P>
   Harris-Lewis, who denies her husband used cocaine, has sued
Mudge and three other doctors, Peter L. Friedman, Mark A. Creager,
and John D. Rutherford, for failing to diagnose Lewis with a
life-threatening heart condition. Lewis died in 1993 shortly after
collapsing on a basketball court.
</P>
<P>
   Outside the courtroom Wednesday, Harris-Lewis declined to
comment on the judge's ruling, saying only that she was ``anxious
for the truth to come out.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm looking forward to restoring Reggie's good name for his
children, his family, the community, his fans, and for me,'' she
said.

LIZ TILBERIS, 51; EDITOR OF HARPER'S 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By SUZANNE C. RYAN  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Harper's Bazaar editor Liz Tilberis, renowned for raising public
awareness of ovarian cancer, died of the disease Wednesday in New
York at age 51.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Tilberis, whose career included a stint as editor in chief
of British Vogue, was diagnosed with cancer in 1993. She described
her struggle with it, and her rise in the fashion industry, in her
1998 memoir, ``No Time to Die.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Liz's instincts and eye for fashion, fashion photography, and
style were unparalleled,'' said Cathleen P. Black, president of
Hearst Magazines, Harper's publisher. ``She will be remembered as
one of the magazine industry's greatest 20th-century talents. And
for those of us who were lucky enough to work with her, her passion
and love for life were inspirational.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Tilberis, born in Shirehampton, England, was a true student
of fashion who, in her early years, eagerly studied fabrics and
designs. She got her foot in the door at British Vogue in 1969 _
not through high-level connections, but by winning an essay
contest.
</P>
<P>
   Although office culture dictated that she wear the most
up-to-the-moment designer clothes, Ms. Tilberis in those days
humbly shopped at Woolworth's and flea markets. She dyed her shoes
different colors every night to match the next day's outfit, and
even repaired the broken zippers of her colleagues' pants to
supplement her $1,500-a-year starting salary.
</P>
<P>
   During an interview in July in Boston, she said, ``I never had
good taste. Even today, I don't feel I have great taste. I trained
to become a designer, and I was a very bad one. When I became a
junior fashion editor, I was very observant. I watched very
carefully women with great taste.''
</P>
<P>
   Her studies paid off and she ascended the ranks at British Vogue
(from intern to fashion assistant to fashion editor to executive
fashion editor to editor in chief) with a reputation for forward
thinking. Under her direction, for example, the late Princess of
Wales graced the cover in 1990.
</P>
<P>
   She was named editor of Harper's in 1992, the 125th anniversary
of the magazine, and she became a fashion force in New York. When
Ms. Tilberis hosted a Christmas party at her home a few years ago,
Calvin Klein was the first one there, followed by Ralph Lauren, and
Donna Karan.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Tilberis introduced to Harper's a higher quality of
journalism by hiring such staffers as internationally renowned
fashion photographers Patrick DeMarchelier and Peter Lindbergh.
</P>
<P>
   The editor tackled her cancer with the same zeal she used to
steer her career. She was convinced that she developed ovarian
cancer from the fertility treatment she underwent years ago.
</P>
<P>
   As the president of the nonprofit Ovarian Cancer Research Fund
Inc., Ms. Tilberis traveled the country speaking about her
experiences and encouraging others. Last summer she told the Globe,
``All I care about is for a woman (with symptons) to make an
appointment'' with her gynecologist.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Tilberis leaves her husband, Andrew; and two sons,
Christopher and Robert.

 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ When Thomas Stacy was a 14-year-old in rural
Arkansas, he made a decision that must have struck his friends as
odd. Having already studied the piano, violin, clarinet and oboe _
moving from one to another as he became captivated by their sound
on recordings _ he resolved to take up the English horn, the
instrument he now plays in the New York Philharmonic, and sold his
motorcycle in order to buy one.
</P>
<P>
   ``It wasn't a Harley or anything, just a small, lightweight
motorcycle,'' Stacy, who is now 60, said in defense of the trade.
Still, one had to ask, why the English horn? ``I think it can be
played like Renata Tebaldi sang, or the way a great cellist plays a
solo,'' he said. ``It innately has a many-hued tonal palette, and a
wide emotional menu, and it offers the possibility and potential of
inflecting each note, to give it forward motion, or make it
something special. People love the sound of it.''
</P>
<P>
   Reviews of the Philharmonic's concerts support that assertion:
in works with prominent English horn lines _ Sibelius' ``Swan of
Tuonela,'' the Largo of Dvorak's ``New World'' Symphony, the
Shostakovich Eighth Symphony, the Tchaikovsky Fourth and Copland's
``Quiet City'' are examples _ his contributions are regularly
singled out for their graceful phrasing and rich tone.
</P>
<P>
   He also made several appearances as a concerto soloist with the
Philharmonic, and at the orchestra's concert Thursday night, with
Sir Colin Davis conducting, he is to give the U.S. premiere of
``The World's Ransoming,'' a concerto by Scottish composer James
MacMillan. (The program is to be repeated Friday morning and
Saturday evening.)
</P>
<P>
   Several of the concertos that Stacy has performed with the
Philharmonic were composed for him, the most recent being Ned
Rorem's 1994 Concerto for English Horn and Orchestra. MacMillan's
work was not. It is the first part of an orchestral triptych called
``Triduum,'' composed for the London Symphony in 1996.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think he uses the various registers of the English horn to
their expressive advantage throughout the piece,'' Stacy said of
MacMillan. ``It is scored for a very large orchestra, and there are
some technical considerations, as there are in most concerti. But
he also creates moments, architecturally, where the English horn
can float out its sound. The greatest difficulty, I think, is to
make sure it expresses something of oneself, and has the right
feeling.''
</P>
<P>
   MacMillan, 39, is part of a growing group of composers around
the world _ others include Arvo Paert, Somei Satoh and Osvaldo
Golijov _ who find inspiration in religious mysticism. In his case,
the source of the inspiration is Roman Catholicism, and the three
sections of ``Triduum'' are meant to evoke the days leading to
Easter. ``The World's Ransoming'' suggests Maundy Thursday and uses
references to the liturgy for that day, including the chant
melodies ``Pange lingua'' and ``Ubi caritas.'' The second part of
``Triduum,'' a Cello Concerto, is for Good Friday, and ``The
Vigil'' is for the night before Easter Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is the first, shall we say, religious concerto that I've
ever played,'' Stacy said, ``and knowing that, I suppose I do
approach it differently from the way I would approach a work
without those associations. But I think of it as contemplative
rather than descriptive, and I tend to bring my own meaning to
it.''
</P>
<P>
   (MORE) &QL; 
</P>
<P>
   Stacy was born in Augusta, Ark., a town with a population of
about 3,000. After piano lessons with his mother, he had brief
flirtations with the violin and the clarinet.
</P>
<P>
   ``Then I heard an oboe on a record in my mother's collection,''
he said, ``and that sound intoxicated me.''
</P>
<P>
   From the oboe it was a short leap to the English horn, the
tenor-voiced member of the same family of double-reed instruments,
and which uses similar fingerings. Stacy also plays the alto of the
oboe group, called the oboe d'amore. In his recitals, he sometimes
plays Gardner Read's ``Phantasmagoria,'' a work in which he is
required to switch between oboe, oboe d'amore and English horn.
</P>
<P>
   Having apparently exhausted Augusta's supply of music teachers,
Stacy taught himself to play the oboe and the English horn with the
help of a book that showed the fingerings. When he was 17, and
still a high school junior, the Eastman School of Music in
Rochester gave him a full scholarship.
</P>
<P>
   ``You have to be a little crazy to teach yourself the oboe,'' he
said, ``but I just wanted to do it, and I did it. I had to start
over when I got to Eastman, because my technique was all wrong. On
the other hand, I think I was a fast learner because, having taught
myself, I was very aware of what I was doing physically.
</P>
<P>
   ``I started out on oboe at Eastman,'' he added, ``but I also
played English horn in some of the performing groups. It was
already my preference. It fits my musical persona like a glove.''
</P>
<P>
   What makes it an odd preference, though, is that opportunities
for English hornists are comparatively few. It does not have a vast
solo repertory. It offers no life whatsoever in jazz or popular
music, and its best prospect in the classical music world is the
possibility of an orchestral position. Even those are few and far
between: orchestras have only a single English hornist, compared
with more than 30 violinists, and three or more flutists, oboists,
clarinetists and trumpeters.
</P>
<P>
   As it happened, Stacy found a job with the New Orleans
Philharmonic soon after his graduation from Eastman in 1960. A year
later he moved to the San Antonio Symphony, and in 1962 he joined
the Minnesota Orchestra, where he remained until he joined the
Philharmonic in 1972.
</P>
<P>
   During his 27 years with the Philharmonic, Stacy has worked with
notable success at creating a solo life for his instrument. He has
given the premieres of 25 works, including concertos and solo
pieces by Stanislaw Skrowaczewski, Gunther Schuller, Vincent
Persichetti, Petris Vasks, Sydney Hodkinson and Calvin Hampton.
</P>
<P>
   He teaches at the Juilliard School and for the last 20 years has
led an annual English horn summer seminar. The seminar began in
Ithaca and has traveled around the country. It is now held in
Carmel Valley, Calif., and attracts, Stacy says, players from 15 to
76. When his commitments to the Philharmonic allow, he tours as a
recitalist, chamber player and orchestral soloist.
</P>
<P>
   ``Arranging the appearances is a different sell for me than it
would be for, say, a violinist,'' he said. ``An orchestra might
decide to program the Beethoven or Brahms violin concerto, and then
decide which soloist to hire. With me, we have to sell both the
repertory and my being the soloist.''
</P>
<P>
   The Philharmonic gives Stacy ample spotlight time as well: he
has given 60 performances as a concerto soloist with the orchestra,
which is unusual among American orchestras for the frequency with
which it presents its first chair players (and sometimes others) in
concertos. Besides Stacy's performances, the coming weeks include
concerto performances by Cynthia Phelps, the principal violist, and
Rebecca Young, the associate principal, in a new double viola
concerto by Sofia Gubaidulina; Christopher Lamb, the principal
percussionist, in a new concerto by Tan Dun; Joseph Robinson the
principal oboist, in the Strauss Oboe Concerto, and Joseph Alessi,
the principal trombonist, in William Grant Still's ``Romance.''
</P>
<P>
   ``This MacMillan piece really is a tour de force,'' Stacy said,
``and several people have remarked on the endurance required to get
through it. But I don't know _ I never think about that. And now I
kind of wish no-one had mentioned it to me.''

EARLY INSPECTION RULES OUT EXTERNAL CAUSE FOR WHALE'S DEATH 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By SCOTT ALLEN  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WELLFLEET, Mass. _ In life, Staccato was a rare ray of hope for
the world's dwindling band of Northern right whales, a strong
female who bore at least six calves over the last 25 years, making
her the mother of perhaps 2 percent of the whole species.
</P>
<P>
   In death, turned awkwardly on her side on a sandy beach as an
autopsy team methodically stripped the blubber from her body,
Staccato became another symbol of man's inability to protect the
most endangered large whale species in the world.
</P>
<P>
   Despite extraordinary measures to save the creatures such as
planes assigned to keep an eye on them, Staccato died from causes
that have not yet been determined, bringing the right whales one
step closer to extinction.
</P>
<P>
   ``We know every one of them that washes up on the beach. I hate
going to these things,'' said Scott Kraus, director of the Doc
Edgerton Lab at the New England Aquarium who estimates he has seen
Staccato two dozen times. ``You keep rooting for them to have
babies, but the population keeps going downhill.''
</P>
<P>
   The autopsy, conducted under sunny skies before a crowd of
onlookers on a stretch of the Cape Cod National Seashore, resembled
a demolition project more than a medical procedure, as a back hoe
attempted to pull the head away and workers carved the carcass with
scythe-like tools called flensing knives.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the grim task and the powerful odor, however, the
45-foot-long whale will be a bonanza for researchers looking to
better understand the whales' plight. Almost every part of the
animal, from the blubber to the eyeballs to her skeleton, was
promised to a researcher or an educational institution.
</P>
<P>
   ``Whenever we get our hands on a right whale, we pull out all
the stops'' for the autopsy, said Douglas Beach, in charge of right
whale protection efforts at the National Marine Fisheries Service.
He said researchers want to know everything from Staccato's age to
any chronic diseases she might have had.
</P>
<P>
   For reasons that researchers are still debating, the Northern
right whale population has not recovered more than 60 years after
the last of the whalers put away their harpoons. While other whale
species, such as the humpbacks, have shown strong population growth
in recent years, the right whale population has remained stuck at
around 300 members.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, researchers at Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution and
the University of Massachusetts at Boston recently concluded that
the slow, steady loss of whales like Staccato have put the species
on a course for extinction if current trends continue.
</P>
<P>
   When Staccato's carcass was reported floating off Wellfleet's
Great Island on Wednesday, speculation centered on whether she had
been struck by a boat, the leading cause of human-induced death.
Officials at the state Division of Marine Fisheries had been
worried that an unusually large number of right whales had gathered
in the bay, making them vulnerable to boat strike.
</P>
<P>
   But the autopsy team, led by David St. Aubin of the Mystic
Aquarium in Connecticut, could find no signs of external injuries
from a boat strike, nor any signs that the whale had become fatally
entangled in fishing nets. However, the team could not rule out a
ship strike until members examined internal organs for damage.
</P>
<P>
   On the other hand, St. Aubin's team found ulcers on her big gray
tongue that could indicate a viral infection, as well as unusual
lesions near her fluke. Still, St. Aubin said he could not say
whether disease played a role in Staccato's death until he examined
her internal organs _ and perhaps not even then.
</P>
<P>
   ``At this point, we have no diagnosis,'' said St Aubin, whose
work was hindered by an advancing afternoon tide that pooled around
Staccato's carcass.
</P>
<P>
   Yet, the questions surrounding Staccato's death matched the
</P>
<P>
   questions about what should be done to save the species.
Officials at the National Marine Fisheries Service, which is
drafting a new 10-year protection plan, say the sheer size and
range of the whales makes them hard to protect.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can't have a right whale hatchery'' to increase the
population, Beach said, because 60-ton whales need far too much
space to live, ranging from Florida to the Bay of Fundy in the
wild.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, state and federal regulators have tried to prevent more
whale deaths, but that has proven difficult, requiring widespread
controls of fishing gear and shipping traffic on the Eastern
seaboard to prevent whale strikes and entanglements that occur just
a few times a year.
</P>
<P>
   However, Kraus of the New England Aquarium said the federal
government needs to make a bold investment in the whales, much as
they have other high profile rare animals. He noted that the
Clinton Administration wants to spend $127 million to protect
salmon in the Pacific Northwest, but the National Marine Fisheries
Service spends just $1 million a year on right whales.

</P>
<P>
   &UR; FEATURE stories &LR;  &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   CONCEPTUAL-ART (New York) _ Is it going too far to say that
Conceptual Art has been to the second half of the 20th century what
Cubism was to the first half _ that is, a great divide, a
demarcation after which nothing was quite the same? Maybe, but not
by much. Conceptual Art produced far fewer masterpieces than
Cubism, having disavowed the very term, and overall it probably did
not turn out as many art objects, dematerialization of art being
one of its goals. But in some weird, insidious way, it may have had
a greater impact on art, our view of art and its relationship to
life. By Robert Smith. (Moved).
</P>
<P>
   &UR; FILM AND VIDEO &LR;
</P>
<P>
   WU-CHINESE-FILMS (Undated) _ Wu Tianming is well acquainted with
the whims of fortune: During the 1980s, as an acclaimed director,
he headed Xian Film Studio, the cradle of the New Chinese Cinema,
which burst upon the nternational scene with the force of a
revelation. Less than a decade later, he was reduced to running a
video store in Los Angeles. Today, Wu, at 60, is once again working
as a director in China. On a recent visit to New York, he looked
back on these twists of fate with remarkable good humor. By Leslie
Camhi. (Moved). Photo.
</P>
<P>
   NICHOLS-AWARD (New York) _ Mike Nichols, having moved from comic
duologues with Elaine May from their student life at the University
of Chicago, to theater (winning seven Tony's as a Broadway director
and one as a producer) to film, will be honored by the Film Society
of Lincoln Center on May 3 with an annual lifetime achievment award
that first went to Charlie Chaplin in 1972 and was given to Martin
Scorsese last year. By Peter Applebome. (Moved).
</P>
<P>
   &UR; DANCE &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   SWAN-LAKE-BALLET (Undated) _ George Balanchine once told Peter
Martins: ``You know, dear, we should call all ballets `Swan Lake.'
People will come.'' Martins certainly hopes people will come to the
complete ``Swan Lake'' he is staging for the New York City Ballet.
It opens the company's spring, 50th-anniversary season at the New
York State Theater on Thursday night and will be performed through
May 9. By Jack Anderson. (Moved).
</P>
<P>
   DANCE-ARCHIVE (New York) _ Four centuries of ballet tradition
and evolution are encoded in the bodies and minds of the dancers'
teachers and coaches: in Frederic Franklin, one of the last of the
Ballet Russe de Monte Carlo stars of the 1930s, in the great Soviet
ballerina Irina Kolpakova, who performed with the Kirov Ballet in
Leningrad from the 1950s through the mid-1980s, and in Georgina
Parkinson, a leading ballerina with England's Royal Ballet in its
late glory days through the 1970s. The first recorded attempts to
codify dance steps in a script of symbols occurred in mid-15th
century Italy. Today, whole ballets and modern-dance works are
written out and quickly retrievable in computer programs, down to
the smallest steps and gestures and most complex positionings and
travels of dancers across the stage. By Jennifer Dunning. (Moved).

</P>
<P>
   &UR; THEATER &LR;
</P>
<P>
   SHAKESPEARE-BOOK (Undated) _ Harold Bloom, in his recent book,
``Shakespeare: The Invention of the Human,'' leaves no doubt of his
irritation with most of the interpretations he has encountered in a
lifetime of worshiping the plays; for him, the more daring the
attempt, the more excruciating the experience. Here and there in
his 741 pages, Bloom dredges up a kind word about a legendary turn
by an actor whom he has never seen _ Kean or Irving as Shylock _ or
a production that he saw long ago: most memorably for him, the
Henry plays with Ralph Richardson as Falstaff and, incidentally,
Laurence Olivier alternating between Hotspur and Shallow. By Walter
Goodman. (Moved). Photo.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; CLASSICAL MUSIC &LR;
</P>
<P>
   DUKAS-MUSIC (Undated) _ If the average American knows the name
of the French composer Paul Dukas at all, it is probably in
connection with an image of Mickey Mouse, wearing a baggy red robe
and a wizard's hat, battling anthropomorphic broomsticks to the
strains of Dukas's ``Sorcerer's Apprentice.'' Walt Disney's use of
that piece in the movie ``Fantasia'' made Dukas more famous than he
might have dreamed, or even hoped. By David Mermelstein. (Moved).
</P>
<P>
   GUBAIDULINA-MUSIC (Undated) _ A woman among composers; a
freethinker among Soviet apparatchiks; a Christian among atheists;
an Easterner, half Tatar, among Europeans; a modernist among
reactionaries, and a reactionary among modernists, Sofia
Gubaidulina has lived with many conflicts, both with the outside
world and within herself. Her arrival, in her 50s and 60s, at
moments of extraordinary musical power has been a triumph of
persistence and self-searching. Ms. Gubaidulina, now 67, has become
a great light, and her achievement has happily been matched by
steadily increasing public recognition, which reaches a culmination
in New York on Thursday evening, when two big new works will be
presented almost simultaneously: ``Two Paths,'' at Avery Fisher
Hall, and ``In the Shadow of the Tree,'' at Carnegie Hall. By Paul
Griffiths. (Moved).
</P>
<P>
   VIOLISTS-STARS (New York) _ The New York Philharmonic has in
Cynthia Phelps, 38, and Rebecca Young, 33, the principal and second
violists, the best pair of violists of any orchestra in the United
States. By James R. Oestreich. (Moved).
</P>
<P>
   &UR; POP MUSIC &LR;
</P>
<P>
   POP-MUSIC-IDENTITY (Undated) _ ``Identity is the crisis can't
you see,'' declared the female singer Marion Elliott, better known
as Poly Styrene, in a 1978 punk rock song. Proving the prescience
of Ms. Elliott's words, a number of musicians have begun to explore
notions of identity, so often a part of pop music's appeal, by
adopting not just one pseudonym but many. They make the continual
reinventing of musical personas perhaps as entertaining and
meaningful as the music itself. By Michael Kramer. (Moved).
</P>
<P>
   &UR; ART &LR;
</P>
<P>
   DUPONT-MUSEUM (Winterthur, Del.) _ Henry Francis du PONT
probably did not know where history ended and fantasy began when he
devised the American period rooms for the museum here that bears
his name. Apparently nobody else has known the difference either.
Museum officials long insisted that the rooms reflected life in
America between 1640 and 1860. Now, 30 years after du Pont's death
and nearly 50 years after his mansion became the Henry Francis du
Pont Winterthur Museum, visitors are being told that, yes, du Pont
erred. But guides will point out the inaccuracies in only 20 of his
favorite rooms among the museum's 175. They have been returned to
the way he had arranged them, mistakes and all. By Rita Reif.
(Moved).
</P>
<P>
   PHILLIPS-NEW-MUSEUM (New York) _ Ms. Lisa Phillips, who has been
orgnizing exhibitions at the Whitney Museum since 1977, is leaving
to become the director of the New Museum of Contemporary Art in
Soho. By William Harris. (Moved).
</P>
<P>
   &UR; TELEVISION &LR;
</P>
<P>
   TV-NEWSROOM (Undated) _ On ``The Newsroom,'' Ken Finkleman's
dry, riotous take on a Canadian television news organization, any
war, plane crash or nuclear accident had better have the right spin
potential if it hopes to compete for attention with who gets the
prime indoor parking spot or which assistant to hire, the black
lesbian or the blond ski bunny. A huge hit on Canadian television,
``The Newsroom'' made its way south to PBS in 1997 (last New Year's
Eve, WNET in New York reran all 13 episodes back to back) and has
recently been released in a four-tape set by Acorn Media. By Peter
M. Nichols. (Moved).
</P>
<P>
   MAD-TV (Los Angeles) _ ``Mad TV,'' is a sketch-show series that
Quincy Jones and David Salzman pitched as a way for Fox television
to siphon away the X-chromosome contingent from NBC's ``Saturday
Night Live'' audience. (``Mad TV'' starts at 11 p.m., a half-hour
before ``Saturday Night Live.'') But if the boys and girls in baggy
jeans whooping and hollering in the bleachers at a Friday night
taping are any indication, the show has become a big draw for 12-
to 17-year-olds of both sexes. By Margy Rochlin. (Moved).

 &HT;    Liquid refreshment: A relaxing `spa' bath with all the trimmings
restores a sane outlook

<TEXT>
<P>
   Feeling tired, overworked and stressed? Relax and put your feet
up.
</P>
<P>
   For some women, that means a day or weekend at a full-service
spa. But if you don't have the time or the money, you can create a
similar experience at home using spa products designed to
rejuvenate the body and soul.
</P>
<P>
   All it takes is one hour and a hot bath.
</P>
<P>
   Pamela Kinzer Trettel of Atlanta makes a ``spa'' bath part of
her weekly ritual. The 32-year-old special events planner says her
health problems and stress level have improved as a result of the
pampering and relaxation therapy.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now I can't live without it,'' she says. ``I try to do it more
than once a week, but sometimes it doesn't always happen.''
</P>
<P>
   Health and beauty experts say prioritizing is key.
</P>
<P>
   You have to put yourself at the top of your to-do list, put down
the cell phone, turn off the beeper and lock the bathroom door.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we think about an hour and how much time we spend and waste
in an evening, we can take that time to do something nice for
ourselves. It helps your head. It helps you feel like you're worth
it,'' said Sydell Harris, owner of Spa Sydell, which has five
locations in the Atlanta area.
</P>
<P>
   To create the mood, start with scented candles, soft music and
aromatherapy, the art of using essential oils to treat the body and
mind therapeutically.
</P>
<P>
   Clean your body and face with an exfoilating scrub. Rinse off in
the shower and towel dry. Now it's time for a luxurious bath. To
begin, fill the tub and put a few drops of an essential oil into
the water. Harris recommends lavender or rosemary for relaxation.
</P>
<P>
   While the bath water is running, apply a facial mask. Soak for
at least 15 to 20 minutes. While you are there, massage your feet.
Place camomile tea bags on the eyes to reduce puffiness. Then rinse
off. After towel drying, apply a massage oil to the body, a foot
cream on the feet and lotion on the hands.
</P>
<P>
   It's that simple.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you try to do too much, you'll start working too hard.
Choose one or two things and make it a very comfortable, relaxing
experience,'' says Patti Beggs, owner of Natural Body Day Spa,
which has four locations in the metro area.
</P>
<P>
   For example, instead of trying to polish your nails and toes and
color your hair after the bath, leave it for another night. A long
bath is more important.
</P>
<P>
   Candace Ragsdale, director of Jolie the Day Spa in Atlanta,
recommends muscle soaks for women who exercise a lot.
</P>
<P>
   And if you can get a massage _ whether at home or at a spa later
_ go for it, she says.
</P>
<P>
   ``Massaging the body is becoming a must, not a luxury,''
Ragsdale adds. ``It's a necessity to relieve the stress and tension
the body endures.''
</P>
<P>
   Finding aromatic products to enhance the spa experience is easy.
The industry has grown so much that consumers can purchase them at
full-service spas, bath shops, department stores and discount
chains.
</P>
<P>
   ``In 1995, the aromatherapy business had grown from a
nonbusiness to a $230 million business,'' said Aubin Wilson, show
manager of Ex.Tracts for George Little, a New York trade show
management firm. ``Since then, a host of people, like Coty for
example, have gotten into the market. Coty is now doing the whole
Healing Garden line.''
</P>
<P>
   The trend is being driven by baby boomers who are trying to slow
down their hectic lifestyle _ and the aging process _ by turning
their homes into oases of peace and tranquillity.
</P>
<P>
   Target recognized the trend with its own line of products last
year called Inner Spirit. The line, which includes a muscle soak,
polishing body scrub and moisturizing body lotion, is made with
lemon grass and ginger.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't really call it aromatherapy, because we don't
necessarily have all essential oils in our products. We call it
wellness,'' said Sherry Day, buyer of bath and fragrance products
for Target.

ALLEGED KILLERS FIT A DANGEROUS PATTERN 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MITCHELL ZUCKOFF  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   LITTLETON, Colo. _ The black BMW was a fixture outside the Reed
Street home where Eric Harris lived, an almost daily sign of
another visit by the car's owner, Dylan Klebold, a loner in
fatigues and a black trench coat who didn't want to be alone.
</P>
<P>
   Until Monday, the day before the two young men allegedly
massacred 12 fellow high school students and one teacher before
killing themselves, the visits to Reed Street seemed as
unremarkable as Klebold and Harris themselves. The two invariably
stayed inside, avoiding the sunshine to retain a ghoulish pallor,
working on computers, and commiserating about their shared plight
as teenage misfits, according to friends, neighbors, and
classmates.
</P>
<P>
   But at about 9:30 a.m. Monday, when they should have been at
school, Harris and Klebold arrived together in the BMW, seeming
agitated and hurried, acting as if something had gone wrong, said
Bill Konen, a human resources consultant who lives next door on the
quiet cul-de-sac of modern $200,000 homes.
</P>
<P>
   ``I heard one say, `I need a metal baseball bat,''' recalled
Konen, who was painting the back of his house, unnoticed by the
pair. ``They left the garage door open, like they didn't care who
saw them. And then all you could hear was breaking glass, like they
were smashing the place all up.''
</P>
<P>
   It was a far cry from the polite young man whose mother had
introduced him to Konen as a ``computer nut'' who would be happy to
help set up an Internet web site. In retrospect, according to Konen
and more than two dozen others interviewed Wednesday, Monday's
outburst was the most outward sign of what was brewing. Before they
allegedly brought guns and pipe bombs to school on Tuesday, causing
the deadliest rampage inside an American school, Harris, 18, and
Klebold, 17, seemed not terribly different from thousands of
teenagers who gravitate toward each other at least in part because
they don't fit anywhere else.
</P>
<P>
   They were neither athletic nor particularly studious, lacking
social skills and the grace and self-confidence that popular
teenagers often possess or project. But unlike Harris and Klebold,
the overwhelming majority of youths in such situations never
respond with violence.
</P>
<P>
   Whatever set the Columbine High School killers into deadly
action is not known, authorities said Wednesday, acknowledging that
with the two suspects dead, they may never have more than troubling
pieces of an incomplete puzzle.
</P>
<P>
   Already, though, a picture can be drawn of Harris and Klebold
that fits a disturbing pattern among young men who erupt in deadly
rage in the places they see as the locus of their torment: their
schools.
</P>
<P>
   They were members of a self-styled ``Trench Coat Mafia,'' fellow
students said, describing the group of anywhere from 15 to 30
students as outcasts who often dressed in black or in military
fatigues, covered by long black trench coats or Australian-style
duster coats. At times, some also wore red or green berets,
students said.
</P>
<P>
   Several students said Harris, Klebold and their friends spoke of
mutilating animals, and were interested in the occult, androgynous
rock star Marilyn Manson, and World War II, especially Nazism and
Adolph Hitler, whose birthday was Tuesday. Harris, in particular,
was interested in German culture and often spoke German, said Matt
Good, 16, a sophomore who lived two houses away from Harris.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was quiet, but he wasn't mean or anything,'' Good said.
``He just hung around with that group, and pretty much all of them
were strange.''
</P>
<P>
   By contrast, Good said, Klebold ``seemed really mean. He glared
at people all the time.'' Several other students commented on
Klebold's temper.
</P>
<P>
   Good said he heard Klebold make comments about blacks and Jews,
who together make up only a small minority in the school of 1,800
students.
</P>
<P>
   Harris and Klebold also seemed particularly angry about the
perceived popularity and power of student athletes. ``You'd always
hear them say, `Jocks think they can run the school,' and stuff
like that,'' Good said.
</P>
<P>
   Yet, at the same time, they also reportedly were enrolled in a
morning bowling class, built web sites for fun, and Klebold _ a
lanky six-foot-three _ was an active member of a fantasy baseball
league. They also reportedly had made a video about how to cope
with teenage life, though some students who said they saw it
claimed it contained hints about the violence that was to come.
Authorities said they had obtained a copy.
</P>
<P>
   ``The boy next door has a silent crisis: He's desperate, lonely
and confused about his self-esteem,'' said William Pollack, a
clinical psychologist at Harvard Medical School and author of the
book ``Real Boys: Rescuing Our Sons From the Myth of Boyhood.''
``The line between the normal, healthy boy and the ones who pick up
a gun is much thinner than we would like to think. My question is,
`How come more don't do it?' ''
</P>
<P>
   School officials said they were unfamiliar with the Trench Coat
Mafia, saying they considered it part of the ``goth'' crowd of
teenagers who wear black lipstick and white face powder, and who
claim to follow satanic rituals. But students scoffed at the
suggestion that the group was unknown.
</P>
<P>
   ``Every student in the school knows about them,'' said Josh
Nielsen, 17, a junior. ``If the teachers didn't, they sure should
have.''
</P>
<P>
   In fact, a group of so-called Trench Coat Mafia members posed
for a photo in Columbine's 1998 yearbook; neither Harris nor
Klebold appears in the photo, under which a caption reads: ``Who
says we're different? Insanity's healthy.''
</P>
<P>
   But Klebold's picture in on a separate page, with the statement:
``After going through many experiences in their lives, oftentimes
students have regrets of past actions.''
</P>
<P>
   By some accounts, the ``mafia'' included an 18-year-old named
Robert Craig, who in 1997 killed his stepfather and then fatally
shot himself, according to police. It was not immediately clear if
Craig was a friend of Harris or Klebold.
</P>
<P>
   Authorities said Harris and Klebold's only previous run-in with
the law was a 1998 criminal trespass case in which they attempted
to break into a car intending to steal its contents.
</P>
<P>
   Wednesday morning, the only sign of activity at Klebold's house
was a sheriff's deputy parked in the driveway, shooing away
reporters who hoped for a glimpse of his parents. The house _
located on the fringe of a national park _ was magnificent, two
wood-and-glass structures framed by massive sandstone formations.
</P>
<P>
   The Harris family moved to Reed Street, about 10 miles from
Klebold's house, about two years ago, neighbors said. Keith Huff, a
sales representative who lives across the street, said Harris's
father, Wayne, was a retired military man; he did not know whether
Harris's mother, Cathy, worked outside the home.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think they're good people. They were always nice and
friendly,'' Huff said. ``You didn't see them a lot, but they were
good neighbors.''
</P>
<P>
   Another neighbor, Steve Cohn, recalled that there was a robbery
at a nearby home last year in which several guns and a rifle were
stolen. Cohn said a member of the Trench Coat Mafia, though not
Harris or Klebold, was implicated in the robbery. ``My friend who
was robbed called . . . and just kept saying, `Was it my guns, what
if it was my guns?' '' Cohn said.
</P>
<P>
   No one answered the door Wednesday at Harris's well-tended home;
a black Toyota pickup truck sat in the driveway. Behind a back tire
was the morning newspaper, detailing what the boy who once lived
inside had allegedly done.

 &HT;    Students in other parts of Colorado stunned by school shooting
 &HT;    By Ted Taylor
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   GRAND JUNCTION, Colo. _ The nervousness Grand Junction High
School freshman Trisha Hunt felt
</P>
<P>
   Wednesday should have been reserved for getting a test back or
cheerleading tryouts. But less than 24 hours after the deadliest
school shooting in U.S. history, Hunt said she was actually scared
to go to class.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was nervous,'' said the 15-year-old, referring to Tuesday's
massacre in Littleton. ``If it could happen in Denver, it could
happen here.''
</P>
<P>
   Hunt sat in a circle with four friends eating lunch Wednesday
with the thoughts of what happened just 250 miles away still fresh
in her mind, she said.
</P>
<P>
   Gunfire and explosions riddled the Columbine High School commons
area Tuesday at lunchtime as two students attacked classmates with
guns and homemade bombs. The siege ended with 15 students and
teachers dead. More than 20 additional victims were hospitalized.
</P>
<P>
   Later, authorities discovered 30 explosive devices in the school
and parking lot.
</P>
<P>
   Hunt's feeling of nervousness may have been unique, but a somber
and heavy-hearted atmosphere Wednesday engulfed high schools
normally bustling with spring fever this time of year.
</P>
<P>
   ``The kids were a little quieter,'' said Fruita Monument
Principal Mark Zipse. ``But if there's a good side, I'm seeing a
lot more hugs in the halls and hearing friends telling each other
that they appreciate them a little more.''
</P>
<P>
   Joan Edmonds, principal at Grand Junction High School, observed
the same thing in the halls of her school. ``It was a little more
of a sober feeling today. People caring more about each other,''
she said. ``I feel like everyone realizes that we're all in this
together.''
</P>
<P>
   Several times, Edmonds said, she saw students talk to classmates
they didn't even know or had never spoken to before.
</P>
<P>
   Rita Irvine, a 15-year-old sophomore at Palisade High School,
said teachers were encouraging students to create a better
environment by being more accepting of all students.
</P>
<P>
   ``They were saying that it could happen anywhere and that we
need to give everyone respect at our schools,'' Irvine said.
</P>
<P>
   All the schools have cliques of students that keep to
themselves, Hunt said, and there is even a group at her school who
wear trench coats.
</P>
<P>
   ``But they're involved in things and really nice,'' she said,
adding that they certainly didn't fit the description of suspected
gunmen Eric Harris and Dylan Klebold, members of a group of
outcasts called the ``Trench Coat Mafia.''
</P>
<P>
   Throughout school districts, principals met with their staffs
before classes began to review emergency procedures and talk about
the situation in Littleton.
</P>
<P>
   Tom Kasper, principal at Pomona Elementary School, said he asked
teachers to be listeners Wednesday. As he went around the building
this morning, Kasper said, he heard discussions about what children
had heard and seen on television the night before.
</P>
<P>
   ``In some classes it was being discussed and in others, students
were talking to teachers individually,'' Kasper said. ``It seemed
to be a successful day.''
</P>
<P>
   John Vail, principal at Bookcliff Middle School in Grand
Junction, said first-period teachers were instructed to ask
students if they had questions or comments. After about 15 minutes
to a half hour of discussion, it was business as usual at the
school, he said.
</P>
<P>
   At the high school, Hunt said, teachers actually practiced the
lockdown procedure that helped save the lives of many Columbine
High School students Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   There was also an additional police officer at the school to
offer any assistance he could, Hunt said. ``Some people don't seem
to understand why there's more cops,'' Hunt said. ``But I'm glad we
have more police officers here today.''
</P>
<P>
   School officials would not allow counselors to speak with
reporters, but Zipse and Edmonds said that there have been no
students overwhelmed with emotion.
</P>
<P>
   ``The counselors are not as busy as we thought they'd be,''
Edmonds said. ``They've talked to some students. Some have been
touched more than others and they needed to talk about it a little
longer.''
</P>
<P>
   Michelle Miller, a 14-year-old high school freshman, said she
couldn't even imagine going through what her friends who attended
Columbine were forced to go through. ``To have to look at a list to
find out if you're friends are OK?,'' she said shaking her head.
``I couldn't even go back to that school.''

CAUSES OF DEATH DETERMINED FOR TODDLERS FOUND SLAIN NEAR AUSTIN 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By POLLY ROSS HUGHES 
c. 1999 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   HUTTO, Texas _ A blunt blow to the head killed the little boy
while the girl, also still in diapers, was suffocated, authorities
said Wednesday of two toddlers' bodies found dumped in a shallow
creek outside this small farming town near Austin.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's no question at this point that it is a homicide,''
Williamson County Sheriff Ed Richards said at the rural crime scene
in Central Texas where the bodies, still unnamed and unclaimed,
were found on Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Officials believe the boy is between 1 and 3 years old while the
girl is likely older, between 2 and 4. DNA tests will soon be
conducted to determine whether the children, who strongly resemble
each other, are perhaps siblings.
</P>
<P>
   The sheriff said he was comfortable releasing no more than basic
shreds of findings from the autopsies, performed by the Tarrant
County medical examiner's office in Fort Worth. Information has
been a highly guarded commodity in a confounding case that
authorities say has yielded few concrete pieces of evidence.
</P>
<P>
   Law officers, however, said media focus on the mysterious case
has produced several good leads and they remain hopeful for a
breakthrough.
</P>
<P>
   ``The most horrifying thing about this is no one seems to know
who these children are,'' said Texas Department of Public Safety
spokeswoman Tela Mange. ``These babies have a name, and somebody
knows them and somebody loves them.''
</P>
<P>
   An evidence search of nearby fields has yet to turn up
``anything of any significance,'' the sheriff said. The search
expanded Wednesday to deeper holes in the mostly shallow Brushy
Creek where a couple discovered the small bodies nearly 48 hours
earlier.
</P>
<P>
   A team of five DPS divers unloaded equipment at the scene where
they battled with water moccasins and rugged terrain, said
department spokesman Mike Cox.
</P>
<P>
   ``They've shot several snakes down there. It's real rugged and
real snaky territory that they're going through,'' Cox said.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're just checking to make sure they haven't missed
anything in the search. There are some pockets there that are
fairly deep, so that's why they'll be wearing wet suits,'' he
added.
</P>
<P>
   Cox and others conceded it was unusual not to have identified
the two corpses 48 hours after their discovery. They noted,
however, that children so young don't carry identification or have
dental records that could be checked.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, two Texas Rangers have determined that the
victims &UR;  &LR; don't fit the descriptions of most of the 74 missing
children listed by the DPS Missing Persons Clearinghouse.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know if they've exhausted every name yet but they're
moving pretty far down the list,'' Cox said.

MERGED FLEET-BANKBOSTON WILL HAVE NEW LOOK 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By LYNNLEY BROWNING  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON -- Barely one month after sealing an agreement to combine
into the nation's eighth-largest bank, Fleet Financial Group Inc.
and BankBoston Corp. have hunkered down over the drawing boards to
design a new company out of two dissimilar institutions.
</P>
<P>
   Though regulators won't approve the merger until later this
year, dozens of staffers from both sides are already drafting
blueprints to meld the two companies and select an A-list of
executives who will run the combined bank's businesses.
</P>
<P>
   The planning, a delicate and contentious process that will
eventually result in people and chunks of Fleet and BankBoston
being moved around like building blocks, must be done carefully.
Any missteps could shake investor confidence or scare away
customers, which in turn could hurt earnings and even attract
bidders for the new company.
</P>
<P>
   Executives must figure out how Fleet _ hard-nosed, aggressive,
and diverse in its business lines _ will absorb the smaller and
more consumer-oriented BankBoston, a Brahmin institution with an
international presence that Fleet lacks.
</P>
<P>
   There is social engineering, too.
</P>
<P>
   Redesigning the corporate structure means creating a new
hierarchy _ a sticky winnowing in which some senior BankBoston
executives will find themselves working under Fleet peers. Despite
efforts by both banks to describe their $15 billion merger as one
of equals, Fleet, which held its annual shareholders' meeting
Wednesday, has moved quickly to take the reins of the planning
process.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier this month Fleet's mergers and acquisitions strategist,
H. Jay Sarles, and his counterpart at BankBoston, Peter J. Manning,
separately drew up charts showing what each thought the new bank
should look like. While the two men are jointly in charge of
melding the two companies, most of the work and decisions are being
made by Fleet's head of corporate strategy and development, Brian
T. Moynihan.
</P>
<P>
   With a staff of 12 people, mostly from Fleet, Moynihan is
designing a new organizational structure, drafting cost-savings and
revenue-boosting plans, overseeing plans to divest $13 billion in
deposits and $5 billion in assets, and plotting how to win both
regulatory and shareholder approval.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Fleet chief executive Terrence Murray and his
BankBoston counterpart, Charles K. ``Chad'' Gifford, have discussed
four times in recent weeks which 50 executives will be in charge of
the new company's 20 main business lines.
</P>
<P>
   ``You have to resolve issues of both turf and people,''
explained one BankBoston source. ``What might be under one function
at BankBoston is under another one at Fleet.''
</P>
<P>
   Six of the nine top executive positions at the combined bank
have already been filled by Fleet people. So when the original list
of next-level executives proposed by Murray was full of Fleet
names, it raised Gifford's hackles. Murray, in the mood for
compromise, has since sought ways to include more BankBoston
executives, but the two men are still wrangling. The list is to be
unveiled early next week.
</P>
<P>
   Referring to the list, Thomas F. Theurkauf, a banking analyst at
Keefe, Bruyette &AMP; Woods Inc., said, ``the next organizational
charts are critical. You have to establish clear lines of authority
immediately.''
</P>
<P>
   The combined bank plans to keep intact BankBoston's inner-city
branches, known as First Community Bank. But it is has not been
decided whether Gail Snowden, who now heads the network, will
continue to do so at the combined company, sources said.
</P>
<P>
   The biggest squabbles are over how to organize corporate, or
wholesale, banking. With a large, sophisticated lending practice
steeped in tradition _ it financed McDonald's Corp. founder Ray
Kroc and the classic Hollywood film ``Casablanca'' _ BankBoston
caters to the nation's top companies and has a national reputation.
BankBoston groups San Francisco investment bank Robertson Stephens
Inc. into its wholesale banking unit.
</P>
<P>
   Fleet, by contrast, is much more modest, and primarily focused
on midsize New England companies. Combined, the two banks, with
$178 billion in assets, will be the nation's top commercial finance
provider and number three commercial lender.
</P>
<P>
   To help him decide who and what go where, Moynihan has two dozen
people _ half from Fleet, half from BankBoston _ who will soon
begin gathering data on core business lines, from retail banking to
an on-line brokerage. The idea is not just to glue the two banks
together but to figure out, for example, which structure will help
the combined bank sell Fleet-run mutual funds in Latin America,
where BankBoston has a major toehold.
</P>
<P>
   ``Fleet is very good at doing these types of things, and they're
going to take the best of both institutions,'' said Charles Wendel,
president of Financial Institutions Consulting in New York.
</P>
<P>
   Murray told Fleet shareholders at the annual meeting that the
combined company would have earnings per share growth of 10 percent
a year from 2002, after 6 percent in 2001 and 1 percent next year,
and return on equity _ a measure of profitability _ of 18 to 20
percent from 2001.
</P>
<P>
   Half of the new bank's projected $600 million in cost savings
will come from job cuts of up to 5,000 positions, or 8.3 percent,
of the combined bank's work force. Sixty percent of the savings
will be achieved in 2000, the first year of operation.
</P>
<P>
   Over the first two years, the combined bank will have
incremental earnings, or earnings in excess of what the two banks
would have made separately, of $400 million. That extra capital
could be reinvested or used to buy back stocks or make
acquisitions, Fleet's chief financial officer, Eugene M. McQuade,
said.
</P>
<P>
   Murray brushed off shareholder questions about Fleet's stock
price, which is down 1.3 percent so far this year despite strong
first-quarter earnings and a booming stock market. Fleet shares
slipped nearly 12 percent after the merger was announced on March
14 but have since rebounded. Gerard Cassidy of Tucker Anthony Inc.
said the decline came from shorting of the stock and worries about
how the two banks would integrate, among other factors. Fleet rose
1/2 to close at 44 15/16 Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Separately, McQuade said Fleet was deciding whether to sell
shares in its booming on-line brokerage, Suretrade, to the public.
A decision is to be taken in the next two months.
</P>
<P>
   Around 5 percent _ an average rate _ of the combined bank's 8
million household customers are expected to feel inconvenienced
enough by the new merger to switch to a new bank.
</P>
<P>
   Integration planning, according to executives at both banks, is
supposed to be collaborative and help create a unified culture out
of Fleet and BankBoston. The banks expect to close their deal in
the fourth quarter immediately after receiving regulatory approval.
</P>
<P>
   But while merger integration staffers gathered recently to
attempt to bond over pizza, the two sides are not yet feeling like
one happy family.
</P>
<P>
   Said one Fleet staffer: ``It's too early for that.''

BURNS PLAYING CAUTIOUS WITH THORNTON 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By KEVIN PAUL DUPONT  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON -- Emphatically, unequivocally, Pat Burns said Joe
Thornton will not play Thursday when the Bruins open up Round 1 of
the playoffs against the Carolina Hurricanes.
</P>
<P>
   OK, coach, we'll see.
</P>
<P>
   ``Look, I've been down this road before,'' Burns harrumphed,
once informed that his star pupil, the gangly and talented
second-year center, said he was feeling pretty good after
Wednesday's workout and thought he probably (itals)could(unitals)
suit up tonight. ``Too many times. I've seen it . . . heard it. Too
many times.''
</P>
<P>
   Players. Their heart can be in the right place, their head in
the clouds well-intentioned self-deception. Thornton has been
nursing a strained something-or-other in his chest since the
weekend, and Wednesday, once more, Jumbo Joe didn't practice with
the rest of the black-and-gold gang.
</P>
<P>
   In Thornton's spot, smack dab between Dmitri Khristich and
Sergei Samsonov, Burns had Randy Robitaille playing the pivot.
Thornton, following a lengthy physical therapy session (he's been
having two-a-days on the table) in the trainer's room, skated
briefly on his own.
</P>
<P>
   At 12:06 p.m., the lights turned low inside the Ristuccia rink
in suburban Wilmington, Thornton planted feet and hands on the ice,
near the door that leads to the club's dressing room, and snapped
off an impressive round of pushups. He didn't wince. He popped back
up on his feet, smiled the ever-present Thornton smile and clomped
off the ice.
</P>
<P>
   ``It feels unbelievable, a big improvement, really,'' said
Thornton, the former No. 1 draft pick who is the key factor in the
Bruins holding together a two-line offensive attack. ``It felt
good, shooting. I wound up and it felt good. You know, I think I
might be able to play.''
</P>
<P>
   Only some 30 minutes before, Burns declared Thornton a scratch.
He went on to say that Thornton could be back for Game 2 Saturday
or Game 3 Monday at the Vault. By missing Thursday, said the coach,
Thornton would have three days of rest leading up to Game 2.
</P>
<P>
   ``You get (Keith) Primeau in your face,'' said Burns, referring
to the Canes' behemoth center and the physical toll he can exact,
``it's a different game.''
</P>
<P>
   Thornton will be back on the ice Thursday morning when the
Bruins go through the paces of their pregame skate in Greensboro,
N.C. Chances are, he'll feel even better than Wednesday, making
chances even better that he'll tell Burns that all systems, sternum
and all, are ready to go.
</P>
<P>
   ``Put me in coach,'' he'll say. ``I'm ready to play.''
</P>
<P>
   And then it will be up to Burns to decide between head and
clouds.
</P>
<P>
   ``He wants you to be 95 percent (ready) rather than 80
percent,'' said Thornton, figuring how a bargaining session with
Burns might play out. ``I think I'm, oh, 85 percent.''
</P>
<P>
   Ten percentage points and the deal gets closed. If Burns were
working the floor of a car dealership, he'd drop his pen on the
desk, gently rake his fingers through his hair, and tell Thornton
to stay seated while he consulted with his sales manager. He'd
wander off to a desk in the corner, strum his fingers across the
boss's three-ring binders, and come back with an offer so good it
would jeopardize the future of the dealership.
</P>
<P>
   But Burns is too wise, too savvy for these negotiations. An
ex-cop, he prides himself on an innate ability to outthink the
other guy, be he street thug, opposing coach, or millionaire kid
with a realistic dream of superstardom. He likes Thornton, and he
is smart enough to know that ultimately there could be a very high
reward for being one part foster father, one part demanding coach.
</P>
<P>
   Burns would love to be able to put Thornton in there.
</P>
<P>
   ``Here's how that goes,'' said Burns, as if reciting from some
TV movie he's seen a thousand times. ``The player's hurt and he
tells you he can play, `Oh, I'm OK coach . . . please, please let
me play.' He gets out there and, boom, first shift he gets hurt
again and he's all done. Then what do you do? You dressed him, now
he can't play, and you're behind the bench with one finger up your
nose and the other one . . .''
</P>
<P>
   For those who can't stand the suspense, the other finger goes in
a place it also doesn't belong. If the coach feels Thornton doesn't
belong in a sweater, he'll point him in the direction of the press
box. From there, maybe Robitaille will get his chance to light it
up in the big time, or perhaps Burns will wring more out of fewer
forwards, double shift Jason Allison, ask Khristich to work the
slot.
</P>
<P>
   This much clearly changed over the course of 30 minutes
Wednesday, prior to the Bruins breaking camp here and heading to
Hanscom Field in Bedford to catch that charter flight: Burns's
emphatic, unequivocal decision to give Thornton the night off had
been tempered ever-so-slightly.
</P>
<P>
   ``Ah, first game of a series,'' said Burns, working the equation
of risk and reward in his head. ``Maybe if it's Game 5, 6, 7 . . .
he's in there for sure if it's that kinda game.''
</P>
<P>
   From deep in Burns's thought process, you almost could here the
plea: ``Oh, I'm OK coach. . . . please, please let me play.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know,'' said Burns. ``We'll see how it is after the
morning skate.''

TWEAKING THE GAMES THAT PEOPLE PLAY
</HEADLINE>
 (For use Friday, April 23 by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By BOB STRAUSS  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ &UR;  &LR; David Cronenberg's latest ickfest, ``eXistenZ,''
is probably his most erotic movie. There isn't really much sex in
it, but if virtual reality games are your thing, it's a nonstop
orgy.
</P>
<P>
   Besides, after failing to convince us that auto wrecks were sexy
in his last film, ``Crash,'' anything the brilliant but, um,
uniquely fixated director tries to do is bound to seem sensual by
comparison. Even when it inevitably turns your stomach.
</P>
<P>
   The film is set in a near-future when interactive games can be
plugged directly into people's central nervous systems and played
in a kind of hyper-realistic dream state. It revels in such
fun-sounding biotech diversions as surgical body penetrations,
MetaFlesh game-pods and the cool-to-say, ooky-to-see umbycords that
connect the other items together.
</P>
<P>
   There are also gristle guns made out of human flotsam, mutated
creatures that provide assembly line parts for those game-pods, and
yucky, venereal-like diseases that the pink, fondle-ready little
playthings can catch.
</P>
<P>
   If you're still reading, this movie is probably for you.
</P>
<P>
   Actually, ``eXistenZ'' (pronounced like the first three
syllables of existential, which it kind of, sort of is) registers
on the benign end of the Cronenberg gross-out scale. There are no
exploding heads (``Scanners''), no giant talking bugs (``The Fly,''
``Naked Lunch''), and the bioport spinal jacks that people plug
their umbycords _ love that word! _ into are not nearly as
nauseating as the gut cassette slits in ``Videodrome,'' the
Cronenberg film ``eXistenZ'' most resembles.
</P>
<P>
   Jennifer Jason Leigh plays Allegra Geller, a brilliant virtual
game designer who is attacked _ with a gristle gun, of course _
during the first public demonstration of her new masterpiece, also
called eXistenZ. It seems the Realist Underground considers her the
antichrist, responsible for seducing millions into the vivid but
imaginary worlds of her games, and they've offered a fortune for
her assassination (Cronenberg has said that the film's story, the
first original he's written since the 1983 ``Videodrome,'' was
inspired by the Salman Rushdie situation).
</P>
<P>
   Geller escapes into the countryside with an inexperienced
bodyguard, Ted Pikul (English actor Jude Law), and her wounded
master game pod. After an unnerving encounter with a grubby
mechanic/bioport installer (Willem Dafoe in high creep mode), she
and Pikul go into the game in search of permanent damage.
</P>
<P>
   From that point on, every aspect of their reality is called into
question. But then, where did that two-headed mutant amphibian they
encountered while on the lam come from?
</P>
<P>
   The game's virtual world boasts geek-filled electronics stores
and the ultimate disgusting Chinese restaurant. But except for a
few surreal details, it all looks like rural Canada. Oftentimes,
``eXistenZ'' comes off like ``The Matrix'' without the budget; its
what-is-reality? mind games are showcased in a way that emphasizes
their intellectual underpinnings rather than their potential for
action-adventure spectacle.
</P>
<P>
   But that doesn't mean that the more philosophical ``eXistenZ''
is all that smarter than ``The Matrix.'' It sometimes hits on
brilliant ideas _ I especially liked the bits when Geller and
Pikul, not fully in control of their game-world behavior, felt like
actors trapped in a movie they knew was bad.
</P>
<P>
   But there are pat notions aplenty here as well. Although modern
computer technology has refreshened the concept of
worlds-within-worlds-of-illusion for the movies, it's a decades-old
standby in science fiction literature, and sharp new insights on
the subject are hard to come by.
</P>
<P>
   Whatever its weaknesses and transgressions, though, ``eXistenZ''
can be pleasurable in a weird, sometimes mystifying way, which is
more than can be said for most recent Cronenberg.
</P>
<P>
   Must be the umbycord. &UR;  &QL;

 &HT;    Teens' fascination with dark culture could be a sign of trouble
 &HT;    Gary Harmon
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   GRAND JUNCTION, Colo. _ The two Columbine High School students
who went on a bloody rampage Tuesday in Littleton were typical of
many high school students around the state, said Grand Valley youth
pastors.
</P>
<P>
   The ``Trench Coat Mafia,'' as the Littleton students dubbed
themselves, were like many teens on the cusp of adulthood who turn,
for various reasons, to rebellious, dark-themed music, dark
clothing and a dark view of the world.
</P>
<P>
   They tend, said Wayne Hanson, youth pastor at Fellowship Church,
to be intelligent and in search of direction.
</P>
<P>
   ``Littleton is pretty much the epitome of where these kids are
coming from,'' Hanson said, with families that have plenty of
disposable income. And because because both parents work in many
cases, the children have a great deal of free time. ``They don't
want to be labeled as nerds, but we're talking the same kids, only
they've gravitated to a darker side to find strength in each
other.''
</P>
<P>
   Rock singer Marilyn Manson and the band Nine Inch Nails are
favorites, but so are German philosophers Friedrich Wilhelm
Nietzsche and Martin Hiedegger, he said. And, he said, ``They love
to quote the Bible passage, 'Judge not lest ye be judged.' That
gives them a whole lot of freedom.''
</P>
<P>
   Goths, as they are called, are given to shocking dress and
music, he said, because it gives them attention that they don't get
any other way, ``and they don't care if it's good or bad
attention.''
</P>
<P>
   Such worries about Goths are a ``big generalization,'' said
another youth pastor, Matt Rissell of New Life Church, and Brian
Roush of First Assembly of God Church agreed. ``Kids who do the
Goth thing aren't necessarily destructive,'' Roush said. ``Just
because they dress that way doesn't necessarily mean they're
destructive.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We have quite a few Goths groups and they dress with the whole
Marilyn Manson look of black lipstick, black fingernail polish.
Some of these kids are great kids and this is just their way of
finding out who they are, '' he said. ``Some, though, use it to
mask any issues they have.''
</P>
<P>
   Other students also have problems, sometimes just as disturbing
as the images the Goths seek to present, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a lot of angry kids out there,'' he said. ``Some are
kids you'd think would never be angry. There are several kids out
there who are just as much as a threat as those two kids were in
Littleton.''
</P>
<P>
   Rissell estimated that each high school campus has three or so
groups of Goths with five to seven members each.
</P>
<P>
   Dan McGill, youth pastor at St. Joseph's Catholic Church, said
Goths are as much a product of teen cliquishness as of their
problems and fears. ``I think a lot of these kids get into this
stuff without realizing what they're getting into''

TROUT TO SWIM AGAIN WITHIN BISHOP CITY LIMITS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By ROB WHEAT  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   &LR; BISHOP, Calif. _ Mike Seefeldt remembers the first time he got
fishing fever.
</P>
<P>
   He was 7-years-old in 1953 when he went fishing along Bishop
Creek with his father. The fish weren't biting, and Seefeldt was
getting restless as morning closed in on lunchtime.
</P>
<P>
   A Department of Fish and Game truck appeared to make its regular
trout plant, and Seefeldt's eyes grew large as he watched hundreds
of pounds of fish being stocked in the creek.
</P>
<P>
   The young boy thought his father arranged the entire thing.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was a pointy-headed little kid with flappy ears and here I
was fishing and they drop them right in front of me. I mean, there
is God, you know,'' said the Bishop native, now 52 and assistant
manager of the Mount Whitney and Black Rock state fish hatcheries.
</P>
<P>
   The DFG plants in the immediate Bishop vicinity were
discontinued in the 1970s because of budget cuts. Since then,
Bishop children haven't been able to have a similar experience to
Seefeldt's.
</P>
<P>
   So he did something about it. Seefeldt arranged for 2,000
rainbow trout, including about 300 trophy-size fish, to be planted
in Bishop this trout season within the canal on East Line Street
and at Williams Creek _ the North Fork of Bishop Creek on Highway
6. The sites are a half-mile from Bishop's thoroughfare, Highway
395, and fed by Bishop Creek and the Owens River. A third planting
site, in the Dixon Lane canal, may be added later.
</P>
<P>
   Seefeldt is more than a little pleased that a 2{-year push to
resume stocking in and around Bishop's city limits will foster new
memories for some children.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was very sad to see that there wasn't a place where a kid
could go fishing just by walking or biking,'' he said. ``We spend
thousands and thousands of dollars on urban programs ... and
they're great programs, but we've turned our backs on the youth in
the local area. It made me a little mad.''
</P>
<P>
   Bishop's Howard Cleland grew up fishing with Seefeldt and is
glad that the experiences they had can be had again.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's really something for a young man to be able to go out and
bring back something his family can be proud of,'' Cleland said.
``In those days, a trout you could catch around here would mean a
meal. Of course there were also a lot of wild fish there, but I
really think Mike's plan will be a positive thing.''
</P>
<P>
   Bishop resident Tammy Allen is exciting her sons Matt, 15, and
Tim, 13, will have something else to look forward to after school.
</P>
<P>
   ``I feel much better having them walk along a creek, then along
a sidewalk,'' Allen said. ``It's great that they'll have a
real-life alternative to pull them away from the video games.''
</P>
<P>
   Seefeldt, whose childhood fishing gear included toeless tennis
shoes and cutoff shorts, said that was exactly the point to his
dream of restocking the area creeks.
</P>
<P>
   ``Have you ever seen a child's eyes when he catches a fish?''
said Seefeldt. ``How do you describe something like that? I found
biological reasons, ecological reasons, homeowner reasons ... other
positive reasons as to why planting would work, why it would be
good.
</P>
<P>
   ``But the main reason (for me) is to give something back to the
kids and to the community that was so good to me when I was
young.''

a lot of suburban high schools, it is divided into a dozen groups

 &HT;    `Tormented' teens outwardly nonthreatening
 &HT;    By Marlon Manuel and Arthur Brice
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Teen-agers Eric Harris and Dylan Klebold twirled dough
and cooked for Blackjack Pizza in Littleton, Colo. They sometimes
arrived together in Klebold's black BMW.
</P>
<P>
   ``As employees, they were good to excellent,'' said Chris Lau,
who bought the Littleton pizza delivery outlet six weeks ago.
</P>
<P>
   The two high school seniors already were on the payroll. They
last worked Friday.
</P>
<P>
   Their boss, neighbors and classmates at Columbine High School
said there was little warning about the carnage Harris and Klebold
would deliver four days later.
</P>
<P>
   There was no hint that the two members of the so-called ``Trench
Coat Mafia'' _ a gang of downtrodden high school outcasts _ would
turn into a killing machine.
</P>
<P>
   ``Absolutely not,'' Lau said in a telephone interview. ``I had
no familiarity with that group at all. They were normal high school
kids, had the normal high school camaraderie.''
</P>
<P>
   On Tuesday, Columbine High School students said Harris and
Klebold wielded firearms and explosives in a rampage that killed at
least 15 people at the school.
</P>
<P>
   Sheriff's officials said it was a suicide mission: The bodies of
Harris and Klebold were among 12 found in or near the school
library, the bloodiest and most gruesome site on Columbine's
sprawling campus.
</P>
<P>
   The alleged killers died of self-inflicted gunshots, the sheriff
said.
</P>
<P>
   Harris' father _ who did not return repeated telephone calls
Wednesday _ is a retired military man, according to neighbors and
news accounts.
</P>
<P>
   As late as December 1991, Wayne N. Harris received mail at
Wurtsmith Air Force Base in Michigan _ which served as headquarters
for a B-52 squadron that carried nuclear weapons before it was
closed in 1993 _ according to a review of public and private
records.
</P>
<P>
   In a prepared statement, the family said:
</P>
<P>
   ``We want to express our heartfelt sympathy to the families of
all the victims and to all the community for this senseless
tragedy. Please say prayers by everyone touched by these terrible
events. The Harris family is devastated by the deaths of the
Columbine High students and is mourning the death of their youngest
son, Eric.''
</P>
<P>
   In the cul-de-sac neighborhood off South Reed Street in
Littleton, there are 10 houses, most two-stories tall and worth
$100,000 to $200,000. Neighbor Brent Wilde, 47, said the Harrises
moved into their gray-blue house with a brick front about two years
ago.
</P>
<P>
   From what Wilde could tell, Eric Harris wasn't a troublemaker.
</P>
<P>
   ``There was never a lot of noise,'' said Wilde, a financial
planner. ``He was a serious-looking kid. I never saw him smiling.
Last weekend was the last time I saw him. He looked just like the
kid next door.''
</P>
<P>
   Wilde said he noticed that one of Eric's friends came by in an
older-model, flat-black BMW. Wilde said Harris was ``tall and
slender,'' about 6-feet but no more than 160 pounds.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was a normal-looking kid,'' Wilde said. ``He had short
hair. There was nothing unusual about him.''
</P>
<P>
   Classmates said Harris came to school in steel-toed combat boots
and wore a German cross.
</P>
<P>
   Harris' America Online Web site included instructions for making
pipebombs, The Associated Press reported. While the information
can't be verified as authored by Harris, any information considered
relevant to the investigation was copied for the FBI, AOL
spokeswoman Kim McCreery said.
</P>
<P>
   As a Cub Scout, Klebold worked hard for his badges.
</P>
<P>
   He rooted for the Boston Red Sox. He was quiet and smart,
friends said. But he changed around Harris, whom he met four years
ago.
</P>
<P>
   Nick Baumgart, 17, a senior who met Klebold in grade school,
said, ``Dylan was a follower who was constantly looking for someone
to lead.''
</P>
<P>
   The teen-agers linked their home computers and played video
games, including ``Doom.''
</P>
<P>
   ``They had death matches with violent computer games, matching
computer to computer,'' Baumgart said. ``I don't believe violent
video games lead to violence, but this was different. They'd play
these games for hours and hours and hours.''
</P>
<P>
   John House, 17, a senior, said he refused to associate with
Klebold after he joined the Trench Coat Mafia.
</P>
<P>
   ``I went bowling with him, and when he would do something good,
he would shout `Heil Hitler' and throw up his hand,'' House said.
``It just made everyone mad.''
</P>
<P>
   The Trench Coats are fans of Adolph Hitler, speak German to each
other and listen to German techno music, the Denver Rocky Mountain
News reported. Tuesday's massacre took place on Hitler's birthday.
</P>
<P>
   The group was no secret. They posed for a yearbook portrait.
They had a running feud with the school's athletes. Carrying swords
and brassknukcles, the Trench Coats showed up for a fight with some
athletes.
</P>
<P>
   The showdown never happened because the Trench Coats went to the
wrong place.
</P>
<P>
   ``I knew they were capable of violence, but I just didn't know
they would do it,'' Columbine junior Pauline Colby told the Rocky
Mountain News. ``They were just very angry, but they didn't know
how to release their anger. They were angry about people not
accepting them and no one knowing how smart they were.''
</P>
<P>
   The only previous run-in with the law for Harris and Klebold was
a 1998 criminal trespass case in which they attempted to break into
a car intending to steal its contents, according to authorities.
</P>
<P>
   Jeff Shrader, a lieutenant with the Jefferson County Sheriff's
Department, said the Trench Coat Mafia is limited to Columbine High
School.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is the first time we've heard the term,'' Shrader said.
</P>
<P>
   Reached at home Wednesday, senior Julie Duran said Harris and
Klebold were constantly made fun of at school _ to their faces and
behind their backs.
</P>
<P>
   ``These kids were tormented throughout their high school
years,'' Duran said. ``That's one of the problems at Columbine.
It's easy to make fun of people who are different.

 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   BISHOP, Calif. _ Fishing in the Eastern Sierra is full of
complexities, not the least of which are the numerous legal issues
_ what is and isn't allowed. Therefore, the Department of Fish and
Game's ``1999 California Sport Fishing Regulations'' handbook is a
must for every tackle box.
</P>
<P>
   The biggest change?
</P>
<P>
   It would have to be the reinstatement of the ban on
night-fishing in Mono County. No longer can anglers cast lines at
12:01 a.m. opening day, as they could last year for the first _ and
only _ time. Once again they must wait until an hour before
sunrise, as traditionally signaled by a predawn flare at Crowley
Lake, and may only fish until two hours after sunset, as outlined
in Article 2, Section 3.00 of the state fishing code.
</P>
<P>
   Mono is the only county in the Sierra Fishing District where
fish must be targeted exclusively in the daytime; trout can be
taken at all hours in Inyo County, for example. The DFG wanted to
make the fishing hours section of the handbook more uniform and, in
March 1998, allowed fishing after midnight in Mono County. But
residents and county officials concerned over safety issues _ and
the integrity of the customary flare at Crowley _ succeeding in
overturning the decision in June.
</P>
<P>
   The handbook, available at tackle stores, sporting-good outlets
and DFG offices, contains various other restrictions, such as
seasonal closures, fishing tackle and method, and size and take
limits (generally five trout per day, 10 in possession _ on or
after the second day of the season).
</P>
<P>
   And, remember, anglers 16 years and older must have a valid
sport-fishing license displayed ``by attaching it to their outer
clothing at or above the waistline so that it is plainly visible''
(Section 700). The cost is $27.55 for an annual license or $10 for
a two-day license; fishing without one draws a minimum fine of
$250.

<P>
   All right, so the Rangers are off to a shaky start.
</P>
<P>
   But the weather is breezy and warm, daylight lingers into the
evenings, and it's hard for a sports-minded child not to be excited
about baseball.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, children can't play baseball all the time. They have
to leave some time for watching baseball _ and some time for
reading about baseball. Here's a lineup of baseball books that
should score well with young sluggers.
</P>
<P>
   ``Baseball Bob,'' by William Joyce (HarperFestival, $6.95). This
board book for toddlers mixes baseball with another kid favorite,
dinosaurs, in a somewhat strange little story. The book concludes
with a song, The Ballad of Dinosaur Bob. ``He's Mesozoic and
heroic, and he's really green.'' Best for toddlers who like to
think out of the box.
</P>
<P>
   ``Leagues Apart, The Men and Times of the Negro Baseball
Leagues,'' by Lawrence S. Ritter, illustrations by Richard Merkin
(Mulberry Books, $5.95). This excellent book begins with a
discussion of two of the greatest Major Leaguers of all time, Hank
Aaron and Willie Mays. Many fans don't know the two began their
careers in the Negro Leagues. From there, the book segues into bios

SHELTER HELPS MOMS, GIVES BABIES A GOOD START
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By GRACIE BONDS STAPLES 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   ARLINGTON, Texas _ Summer is when the faces at the Arlington
Night Shelter always change.
</P>
<P>
   Not only do they become predominantly female, most of them are
young mothers with small children. And more and more of them are
pregnant.
</P>
<P>
   The shelter is the last place they thought they'd end up, but
the only place they can go to escape the poverty and violence that
characterize their lives.
</P>
<P>
   ``People still think that all we do is serve winos on the back
porch,'' said Beverly Wright, coordinator of Each Baby Counts, a
program that the shelter has launched to help lower the infant
mortality rate among these women. ``There are about 2,000 homeless
people in Arlington. Of those, 75 percent are moms and kids.''
</P>
<P>
   On this morning, the shelter is quiet. Those who spent the night
have gone on to God knows where. But as sure as the sun goes down,
they will be back, and, come summer, their numbers will swell. They
always do.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is a lull now, but as it starts to warm up and school is
out, the numbers will increase,'' Wright said. ``We'll be full of
young mothers and pregnant women who have not had prenatal care.''
</P>
<P>
   It has happened this way for years, she said. As temperatures
rise, tempers begin to flare, and the women have no other choice
but to leave. For years, the only things the shelter could offer
were empathy or, in some cases, a referral to another agency.
</P>
<P>
   This summer promises to be different.
</P>
<P>
   Thanks to a $40,000 grant from the March of Dimes, the shelter
can provide an estimated 25 women with prenatal counseling, a
registered nurse, well-birth and parenting classes, and badly
needed life skills.
</P>
<P>
   Under Each Baby Counts, women will receive help for nine weeks.
After that, two case managers will monitor them and their babies'
progress for up to one year.
</P>
<P>
   Each Baby Counts, not unlike the Birthing Project, aims to help
lower the infant mortality rate, which according to preliminary
1997 statistics from the national Centers for Disease Control and
Prevention is 7.1 infant deaths per 1,000 births. But the black
infant mortality rate is almost double that, at 13.7.
</P>
<P>
   At the night shelter, the majority of clients are white. Half of
them, Wright said, either don't know who the father is or expect a
biracial child. Their babies will generally have chronic health
problems because of low birth weight and a lack of prenatal care.
</P>
<P>
   This is why I'd been invited to talk with Wright. The Birthing
Project was established in 1989, primarily to help African-American
women before their babies were born and ultimately to lower the
mortality rate among this population. Today, it serves women of all
ages and ethnicities And has some 50 chapters nationwide.
</P>
<P>
   I started the Fort Worth chapter in 1998, and since then we have
helped shepherd nearly 20 infants safely into this world. The
chapter is run by volunteers, called ``Sister-Friends,'' who help
young women through the last four months of their pregnancies.
</P>
<P>
   We offer moral and other support, making sure that they get
proper prenatal care and parenting classes through the first year
of their babies' lives.
</P>
<P>
   The women who have sought our help range from 14 to 23 years of
age. They are single and usually have been in broken relationships.
</P>
<P>
   Wright said that with Each Baby Counts in place, the Arlington
Night Shelter hopes ``to make sure the babies are born healthy and
stay healthy.''
</P>
<P>
   That is the Birthing Project's goal also. We do it 10 babies at
a time, but we need your help. If you'd like to be a big sister to
someone, call me or a coordinator in your area.
</P>
<P>
   Summer is coming. That's a promise. But it doesn't have to be
like summers past. Let's work to change things.

Teen boys are flipping for fingerboards 
(For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By LIZ STEVENS 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Ten-year-old Alex Collins is eager to demonstrate his dexterity
on wheels.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is called a pop shove-it, where it goes like this,''
explains the regular at Eisenbergs Skatepark in Plano, Texas, a
haven for skate boarders and in-line skaters. ``And you can grind
like this, which means you slide on, like, metal rails. And you can
do a back flip like this ...''
</P>
<P>
   Alex's mom, Bobbie, stands by smiling while Alex performs the
daring skateboard maneuvers _ on a glass counter top at Eisenbergs,
no less.
</P>
<P>
   A risky stunt? Not when the skateboard is 3 inches long and Alex
is riding it with his fingers.
</P>
<P>
   Fingerboards are it, dude. Among the 10- to 14-year-old set _
mostly boys _ the miniskateboards have begun to generate a buzz
comparable with the Pog craze of several years back.
</P>
<P>
   In November, Escondido, Calif.-based X-Concepts mailed its first
shipment of Tech Decks mainly to regional toy, hobby and clothing
retailers in the West. One sporting-goods store in California sold
4,000 in three weeks.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're cool,'' Bobbie Collins says. ``You're actually
skateboarding with your hand.''
</P>
<P>
   Miniboards have been around for more than a decade, but
X-Concepts is apparently the first to use designs from actual
high-end skateboards, company co-owner Tom Davidson says. ``We made
it real, and we made it cool by putting the (licensed) graphics on
it,'' Davidson says.
</P>
<P>
   The company has rights for the designs on 15 brands of boards
used by pros such as Ethan Fowler, Enrique Lorenzo and soon Tony
Hawk, whom Davidson describes as ``the Michael Jackson of
skateboarding.''
</P>
<P>
   The Tech Decks ($8.99 at Eisenbergs) are wood boards with tiny
working parts, unlike the all-plastic models that have been out for
a while. They come with extra wheels and tools to remove teeny
screws and bolts.
</P>
<P>
   Plus Tech Decks are covered with the same kind of fine-grain
sandpaper _ called grip tape, for you old fogeys _ that lets
boarders ``grind,'' ``ollie'' and ``quarter pipe'' over concrete
surfaces everywhere. Grip tape gives the skateboards a nailfilelike
surface that grips the boarder's shoes _ or in this case,
fingertips.
</P>
<P>
   It's waaay harder than it looks. Try, for instance, landing a
180-kick flip, which 16-year-old Ryan Dawes recently mastered in
less than an hour: Place an index finger on the center edge of the
board and middle finger on the back end and press down, forcing the
board to rotate in the air and change direction.
</P>
<P>
   Even Davidson can't pull that off. ``I can make it jump from my
desk top up to a folder, like I'm going up a curb,'' he says, ``but
I'm 52 years old.''
</P>
<P>
   Davidson's partner, Peter Asher, brought the idea to X-Concepts
via his son, Steven. Last year, the 12-year-old and his friends
started making fingerboards out of cardboard. They copied graphics
out of skateboard magazines and drew them on their imitation
boards. A light bulb blinked on in Peter Asher's head.
</P>
<P>
   X-Concepts has sold more than 2 million Tech Decks in five
months. Mall stores such as Gadzooks and Fast Forward sell the
line, which includes 208 board designs. New and improved
fingerboards are due out this summer, Davidson says, along with
accessories such as an entire miniature Tony Hawk skate park.
</P>
<P>
   ``The sixth-graders had them at school this fall, and they
wouldn't tell any of the fourth-graders where they got them,''
Bobbie Collins says. ``And it was a big mystery.''
</P>
<P>
   Eisenbergs has its Tech Decks in a glass display case next to
the miniskateboard key chains. The skatepark has sold out of the
ramps, but Alex, a Dallas fourth-grader, is undeterred. Balancing
on his in-line skates, he continues to demonstrate his fingerboard
mastery.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's an ollie,'' he says after rolling the Tech Deck eight
inches into the air and back down without his fingers ever leaving
the grip tape.
</P>
<P>
   Alex plays with his fingerboards for hours while watching TV or
goofing with his cats, his mom says. His typical route takes him
through the game room and into his bedroom next door.
</P>
<P>
   ``At my house, I have a couple of ramps I built out of paper,''
Alex says, ``and then I get on, uh, kind of a pool table and I
ollie and then I jump maybe 10 feet and then I slide sideways on my
door and then I come down on my bed about five feet away.''
</P>
<P>
   According to Jeremy Blakemore, ``real'' skateboarders aren't all
that into fingerboards; the toys are for wannabes, says the
18-year-old manager at Eisenbergs.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're mad because they can't really skateboard,'' Blakemore
says.
</P>
<P>
   ``No, that ain't it,'' insists 12-year-old in-line skater Robert
Hood, who admits skateboarding ``is hard.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I know,'' Blakemore adds. ``See. You can't do it with your
feet, so you do it with your fingers.''

OILMAN CHARGES FOREIGN PRODUCERS DUMPING CRUDE 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By DAVID IVANOVICH 
c. 1999 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Crude prices had already dropped to desperately low
levels. But the talk in Oklahoma was that prices in the oil fields
might fall even further, to a staggering $6 or even $5 a barrel.
</P>
<P>
   At those prices, reasoned Harold Hamm, an independent oilman
from Enid, Okla., even the oil-rich OPEC producers couldn't cover
their costs.
</P>
<P>
   Yet even with the depressed prices, foreign crude was flooding
into the U.S. market.
</P>
<P>
   Certain the low prices were all part of a foreign scheme to
drive American producers out of business, Hamm _ inspired by the
success of U.S. steel producers _ launched an effort to file a
federal dumping complaint against four of the world's largest oil
producers, Venezuela, Mexico, Kuwait and Iraq.
</P>
<P>
   ``They wanted to get this market,'' contends Hamm, president of
Continental Resources. ``We're already down to nothing, and they
want that too?''
</P>
<P>
   Hamm's grass roots campaign is highly unusual and probably
quixotic.
</P>
<P>
   No official interviewed could recall a dumping complaint
involving crude. At least one target _ Venezuela _ has officially
denied the charge, while some of the major oil companies are
vehemently opposed to the measure.
</P>
<P>
   If successful, the dumping complaint could push up the price of
imported oil by something approaching 45 percent, not a
particularly popular prospect in much of auto-adoring America.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know how much of a win it would be for the American
public if a substantial amount of the oil imported into this
country would cost several dollars more,'' said one Energy
Department source, who asked not to be named.
</P>
<P>
   But in the Oil Patch, Hamm's movement has spread like a brush
fire.
</P>
<P>
   Some 22 state and regional trade organizations have voiced
support for the dumping complaint, including the Texas Independent
Producers &AMP; Royalty Owners Association, which signed off on the
proposal late Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   The Washington-based Independent Petroleum Association of
America's board of governors is expected to vote on the measure
next month.
</P>
<P>
   Supporters include Raymond Plank, head of one of the nation's
largest independent producers, Houston-based Apache Corp., and
Denise Bode, former head of the Independent Petroleum Association
and now a member of the Oklahoma Corporation Commission.
</P>
<P>
   Venezuela is the nation's largest foreign supplier of petroleum
products. And together, the four target producers account for more
than a third of the oil imported to the United States.
</P>
<P>
   To back up his claims, Hamm points to a Dec. 3, 1997, report
from Caracas in the trade publication Oil Daily.
</P>
<P>
   The story said officials at Venezuela's state-owned oil company
_ Petroleos de Venezuela _ were advocating a strategy to bring down
oil prices in a bid to gain some market share. That strategy
``would result in some marginal production being shut in and force
some high-cost producers, particularly in the United States, out of
business,'' the story said.
</P>
<P>
   Hamm believes Venezuela hoped to push oil prices down a couple
of dollars by overproducing but overshot and helped send prices in
a free fall.
</P>
<P>
   In a recent visit to Washington, Venezuelan oil minister Ali
Rodiguez called the allegations ``absurd and untrue.''
</P>
<P>
   Alejandro Perera, deputy chief of the Venezuelan embassy assured
Sen. Don Nickles, R-Okla., in a recent letter: ``Be assured that
there is no such strategy. ... Far from benefiting Venezuela, low
oil prices have only wreaked havoc with Venezuela's overall
economy.''
</P>
<P>
   Venezuela, Perera wrote, ``has more in common with independent
and small producers of oil in the United States than differences.
Our primary goal is maintaining world prices at sufficient levels
to permit appropriate returns for producers in the United States as
well as Venezuela.''
</P>
<P>
   The producers declined to say why the other nations were
targeted for the dumping action.
</P>
<P>
   Independent producers have been vocal about their opposition to
the United Nations-supervised oil-for-food program for Iraq, which
permits Baghdad to export about $5.2 billion worth of crude every
six months, much of it coming to the United States. They have
lobbied _ so far unsuccessfully _ to persuade the Clinton
administration to try to block the program.
</P>
<P>
   If the dumping action were successful, many large oil companies,
which purchase crude directly from the four producing nations,
could be forced to pay substantially higher prices. The American
Petroleum Institute, the Washington-based trade organization for
Big Oil, has remained neutral on the issue, but some companies are
not hesitating to speak out.
</P>
<P>
   Houston-based Conoco, in a written statement, said it does not
support ``the efforts of any coalition making allegations that
producing countries have dumped oil in the U.S. market,'' noting
``the cost to produce any given barrel of oil may vary widely
within a given country and is almost never known with complete
certainty.''
</P>
<P>
   Chevron Corp., meanwhile, notified the Independent Petroleum
Association that it would not support the measure.
</P>
<P>
   The issue also has caused much friction among the members of the
Independent Petroleum Association. George Yates of Roswell, N.M.,
head of the trade group, came under bitter fire from Hamm and other
independents for agreeing to travel to Venezuela. (Yates' trip,
scheduled for this week, was canceled because of the death of
Yates' father).
</P>
<P>
   If all proceeds as planned, Hamm and his allies will file their
dumping complaint with the U.S. Commerce Department and the federal
International Trade Commission within the next few weeks.
</P>
<P>
   Regulators will then look back at market conditions in the past
year, when oil prices were at their lowest. But the fact that oil
prices have risen substantially since that time and are now at far
more comfortable levels _ crude futures for June delivery closed at
$17.92 on the New York Mercantile Exchange Wednesday _ could well
affect any kind of ruling, trade experts said.
</P>
<P>
   The Commerce Department will decide whether the alleged dumping
actually occurred, while the International Trade Commission will
determine if at least 25 percent of the domestic industry was
harmed or faced the threat of damage as a result of the alleged
dumping.

ALL FACTIONS IN THE VIOLENCE IN EAST TIMOR SIGN A PEACE ACCORD
</HEADLINE>
   (rk) 
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   DILI, Indonesia _ The warring factions in the former Portuguese
colony of East Timor took a tentative step toward reconciliation
Wednesday with the signing of a peace accord.
</P>
<P>
   The six-point agreement, signed in the lush tropical garden at
the residence of the Nobel Peace laureate Bishop Carlos Belo,
commits the militias supporting the Indonesian government and the
separatists to ``stop violence, killing, intimidation and terror.''
</P>
<P>
   Indonesia annexed East Timor in 1976 and the province has been
plagued with violence ever since.
</P>
<P>
   The chief of the Indonesian armed forces, Gen. Wiranto, an
architect of the accord, warned the signers that the document would
be useless unless it is backed up by deeds.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is just a signed document,'' he said. ``It has no meaning
at all if people don't stick to it. This problem is bigger than
just East Timor and Indonesia; it is an international issue.''
</P>
<P>
   He said he had asked the armed forces and the police ``to stop
the violence, to be neutral and treat everyone without
discrimination.'' The Indonesian military has been accused of
fomenting militia violence against the separatists.
</P>
<P>
   East Timor's best known independence leader, Xanana Gusmao, who
is under house arrest in Jakarta, signed the accord earlier
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Another signer for the pro-independence faction, Leandro Isaac,
said: ``Peace is dependent on both sides. If both sides keep their
word there will be peace.''
</P>
<P>
   Basilio Araujo, a spokesman for the groups that want East Timor
to remain part of Indonesia, said that while the agreement did not
specifically mention disarmament, it was implied. ``Once we've
agreed to sign the document, from that day on we won't be able to
carry guns,'' he said. ``The main context of the document is to
stop the violence. The implication is the laying down of weapons.''
</P>
<P>
   The timing of the deal is important. Prime Minister John Howard
of Australia is to hold talks on Tuesday with President B.J.
Habibie on the future of East Timor. Ana Gomes, the senior
Portuguese diplomat in Jakarta, is to visit Dili this week, and an
announcement on a U.N. proposal for the territory is expected this
week.
</P>
<P>
   On Jan. 27, Habibie surprised the international community by
reversing Indonesia's policy with an offer of self-determination
for East Timor.
</P>
<P>
   A provincial referendum supervised by the United Nations,
scheduled for July, has been thrown in doubt by rising violence. If
voters reject the offer of wide-ranging autonomy, Habibie says,
East Timor could be given independence, subject to approval by
Indonesia's parliament.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Last weekend 2,000 supporters of East Timor autonomy within
Indonesia, armed with assault rifles, muskets, bows and arrows,
spears and machetes rampaged through Dili, the provincial capital,
attacking homes and offices of known and suspected supporters of
independence. The toll is unlikely to be known, though accounts of
up to 30 people killed are regarded as credible.
</P>
<P>
   Fearing persecution, scores of people have fled into the
mountains, a common refuge since the days of the Indonesian
military invasion in 1975. The violence has driven many
independence supporters and their leaders underground.
</P>
<P>
   This afternoon, the streets of Dili's commercial area, normally
bustling with shoppers, remained quiet, with many shops still
shuttered.
</P>
<P>
   The peace agreement may have been signed but confidence about
its success remains elusive. Reports from outside the capital
indicate that pro-Indonesian militias are still manning road
blocks.
</P>
<P>
   Outside Belo's fenced compound, which was ringed by military
police, a handful of ordinary East Timorese watched the signing
ceremony with mixed feelings, tinged with skepticism.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's like the problem in Yugoslavia,'' said one woman. ``The
same thing is happening in East Timor. Goodness! I can't believe
what has been happening here.''

   BRIDGEPORT, Calif. _ The Eastern Sierra's past is filled with
cutthroats.
</P>
<P>
   A renegade criminal who shot a member of a local posse led to
the naming of Convict Lake. There was more than one murder on the
streets of Bodie during its golf-rush heyday. And the water barons
from Los Angeles were ruthless in securing virtually all of the
region's water rights in the region.
</P>
<P>
   But north of Conway Summit, overlooking Mono Lake, there was a
cutthroat that preceded even the earliest man in this region _ the
cutthroat trout. In the Walker River drainage, before a time of
irrigation needs and water diversions, these trout grew to great
proportions, more than 20 pounds. They dined on tui chubs in
Nevada's Walker Lake and surged up the West and East Walker rivers
in annual spawning runs.
</P>
<P>
   By the 1960s, it was believed that the Walker River strain of
the Lahontan cutthroat trout _ the only native trout to the eastern
slope of the Sierra Nevada mountain range _ was extinct.
</P>
<P>
   Through water diversions, the West and East Walker often were
left dry before their flows reached Walker Lake. Plants of rainbow
trout, which spawned with the endemic cutthroat, diluted the gene
pool in the rivers. Other strains of cutthroat were released in
Walker Lake. (The Lahontan cutthroat trout also is found in the
drainage systems of the Carson and Truckee rivers to the north and
Nevada's Humboldt River; no trout of any kind is native to the
Eastern Sierra's Mono Basin and Owens Valley.)
</P>
<P>
   Then, in 1975, a small population of cutthroat trout were
discovered in By-Day Creek, just west of Bridgeport. They were
pure-strain Walker River cutthroats, and the Department of Fish and
Game initiated a recovery plan for the species in accordance with
federal regulations. Beginning in 1988, the cutthroats from By-Day
Creek were introduced into Slinkard Creek and eventually into three
other waters in their native range, Mill Creek, Silver Creek and
Wolf Creek. The DFG staff had to remove non-native species _ mostly
brook and brown trout _ from the creeks, and all the waters were
closed to fishing.
</P>
<P>
   The work has paid off.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are very close to complying with all of the requirements of
the Lahontan recovery plan and we might be able to delist the
species and use these trout for (fishery) management programs in
the future,'' said Darrell Wong, a DFG biologist in Bishop who has
worked with the Walker River Lahontans since 1975.
</P>
<P>
   Delisting would allow the DFG to open to catch-and-release
fishing one or more of the streams that hold the cutts. While that
won't happen in time for this year's trout season, it could be
reality in a year or two.
</P>
<P>
   Until then, anglers have a unique opportunity to see what it is
like to catch Lahontan cutthroats in their native habitat, to see
what fishing might have been like here 50 or 100 years ago. Last
year, 40,000 fingerling Lahontan cutts from Heenan Lake were
released into the West Walker River. While these are not the exact
strain of cutts that originally lived here, they are
indistinguishable from an angler's standpoint. By the end of the
season last year, many of these fish had grown into 6- to
12-inchers and were readily taking angler's offerings, especially
dry flies.
</P>
<P>
   DFG officials are so pleased with the success of the cutthroat
plant, Wong said, that another 40,000 fingerlings were going into
the river again early this summer to get anglers accustomed to
seeing the region's native trout. You can catch these trout in the
West Walker River from Pickel Meadows to the town of Walker.
</P>
<P>
   If the success of these cutthroats in area lakes is any
indication, they could live a decade and grow to more than 6
pounds. It could be a snapshot of the future, when the Walker River
strain of cutthroats are restored to the river that bears the same
name.

   HOUSTON _ On the J.E. White &AMP; Sons Brite Ranch in far West
Texas, the breeding stock is typically considered sacred, their
future secure long after other parts of the herd have been sent to
market.
</P>
<P>
   But this year, another plagued by drought, is different.
</P>
<P>
   ``We cut into our young productive cows because there is nothing
for them to eat,'' said Kathleen Hartnett White, who lives on the
trans-Pecos ranch that has been in her husband's family for 114
years.
</P>
<P>
   Charles W. Neeb, district director for the Texas Agricultural
Extension Service in far West Texas, estimated that there had been
a 50-to 80-percent reduction of livestock in that region, with some
ranchers liquidating everything.
</P>
<P>
   As many parts of Texas and portions of the southern United
States brace for a second consecutive year of drought, the
situation in the trans-Pecos may be a sign of things to come.
Ranchers there are confronting tough decisions after drought
conditions that have consumed the area for more than six years.
</P>
<P>
   ``Most people have borrowed enormous amounts to stay in
business,'' Ms. White said, noting that her family had coped by
relying on savings. ``I don't know whether it's worse to spend
everything you ever saved or to borrow.''
</P>
<P>
   But there are concerns that loans may also dry up.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm hearing from bankers that in the year 2000 they might not
be able to continue loans,'' said Susan Combs, the state's
commissioner of agriculture. ``It's too many bad years, too close
together. That is a serious long-term problem for the state.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Combs has predicted that the prolonged drought could drive
some 10 percent of the state's agricultural producers out of
business this year.
</P>
<P>
   In March, Ms. Combs established a ``hay hot line'' to connect
people who need to buy hay with those who want to sell it. If the
drought continues, the hot line can also be used to solicit
donations of hay. In addition, Ms. Combs appointed a drought
coordinator to assist farmers and ranchers who need the help of the
Texas Department of Agriculture.
</P>
<P>
   Although the state has not experienced the fires that Florida
has as a result of the drought, Gov. George W. Bush also declared a
potential wildfire emergency in 167 of the state's 254 counties.
Outdoor burning has been banned in 13 counties.
</P>
<P>
   The drought is being traced to La Nina, a weather system that
operates the opposite of its better-known counterpart, El Nino.
</P>
<P>
   While El Nino is related to warmer-than-normal surface water
temperatures in the Pacific Ocean of South America, La Nina results
when water surface temperatures are colder than normal, said Don
Wilhite, director of the National Drought Mitigation Center at the
University of Nebraska in Lincoln.
</P>
<P>
   El Nino causes above normal precipitation in the southern United
States and California in the winter and above normal temperatures
in the Pacific Northwest, Wilhite said. La Nina, which has not been
studied as extensively, seems to be more associated with drought.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   The center says the drought extends from Arizona east through
Texas and into Florida.
</P>
<P>
   Last year the drought in Texas led to a $2.4 billion drop in
farm and ranch production with $8 billion lost in business that
depends on farming.
</P>
<P>
   As ranchers last year sold off stock to avoid the additional
costs of feeding herds, the average price a pound for cattle
dropped to 59 cents in November 1998 from 65 cents in November
1997.
</P>
<P>
   While the drought was not directly related to a drop in crop
prices that occurred last year, officials said, falling prices did
significantly add to problems farmers already hit by production
losses related to the drought. Corn fell to $2.35 a bushel in 1998
from an average of $2.74 a bushel in 1997 (that was down from $3.19
a bushel in 1996).
</P>
<P>
   With drought-like conditions setting in about three months
earlier than last year, there are some concerns about the impact on
planting. Complicating matters, federal crop disaster money
promised for January _ money that could have been used for buying
seeds _ will not arrive until June.

RANCHERS, BIOLOGISTS WORK TO IMPROVE WEST WALKER FISHERY
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By ROB WHEAT  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   BRIDGEPORT, Calif. _ Cowboy boots and wading shoes. Often they
wind up on either side of the fence.
</P>
<P>
   Ranchers frequently are at odds with anglers and
conservationists who claim their livestock ruin the land by
damaging plants and streams and, ultimately, deplete fishing
opportunities.
</P>
<P>
   But Department of Fish and Game fishery biologist Steve
Parmenter offers one success story. He hopes his West Water River
project will be a national model for how cattlemen and ecologists
can put their differences aside and work together toward a common
goal.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's news to see cowboys and fishery biologists working
together,'' said Parmenter, who specializes in habitat issues that
take years, or even decades to come to fruition.
</P>
<P>
   Under Parmenter's direction, the DFG has hammered out a plan
with local cattlemen to protect a 9-mile section of the West Walker
River, known for the rainbow, brown and, more recently, cutthroat
trout that swim in these waters along Highway 108, northwest west
of Bridgeport.
</P>
<P>
   Alternating the areas where cattle graze, replanting lost native
plants and trees along the stream and creating protective fish
screens are among the ways the river has been rejuvenated.
</P>
<P>
   It couldn't have been done without the ranchers, stressed
Parmenter.
</P>
<P>
   ``The first thing we had to do was establish trust, that we were
on the same side,'' Parmenter said. ``Once I proved to them that
they could still make the same beef, or possibly more (through
improved land management), it helped a lot. Now it's actually
worked out the best for everyone.''
</P>
<P>
   Although one of the pastures in question has been eliminated
from grazing permanently, seven areas are rotated for the ranchers
to use; each meadow gets a reprieve from cow's hooves two out of
every three years to regrow vegetation.
</P>
<P>
   Fish screens were introduced to keep the smaller, juvenile trout
from slipping into offshoot irrigation channels from the main
streambed.
</P>
<P>
   About 4\ miles of new fencing was stretched, some which
connected existing fence sections. Natural barriers keep cattle out
of the water where fencing isn't needed.
</P>
<P>
   Many Southern California anglers from the Federation of
Flyfishers have been have instrumental in replanting Cottonwood
trees and other plants native to the area, which, on maps, appears
as a hodgepodge of private holdings, U.S. Forest Service property
and DFG land.
</P>
<P>
   ``The problem was the stream was widening and becoming more
shallow, with the fish having less room to go deep and grow,''
Parmenter said. ``Now we're starting to intensely study this plan.
For example, if rotating the (grazing) areas really works well,
then we can open up the permanently closed site. If not, then we'll
have to look at other solutions.''
</P>
<P>
   Arnold Settelmeyer, whose family has been working cattle since
the 1890s and in this Mono County area since 1918, is glad the
ranchers and biologists could reach consensus.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's kind of like herding sheep now; (the cattle) stay
together on the rotating pastures,'' Settelmeyer said from his
ranch in Gardnerville, Nev. ``We're only on (each of) those meadows
about 20 to 30 days a year, and there's a lot more awareness of the
willows and growth in the area.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have other ranchers call me and ask all kinds of questions.
They're hesitant for sure, but if we can just get them out there
and show them, it really changes minds.''
</P>
<P>
   But Parmenter also had a bargaining chip _ Pickel Meadow
pasture, rich in vegetation, was one of the five disconnected
parcels of land, totaling 990 acres, that the Wildlife Conservation
Board purchased in 1988.
</P>
<P>
   ``It would have been hard to have cattle up there without Pickel
Meadow; it would have really hurt the ranchers,'' Parmenter said.
``But we wanted to work with them. And, so far, it's been great. It
wasn't an easy thing for them, but Arnold really cares about the
land and you can tell.''
</P>
<P>
   Now management of the next phase of the project turns to fishery
biologist Dawne Becker, who will work with agencies such as the
U.S. Forest Service and the UC Santa Cruz on monitoring and
learning from the land-management experiment.
</P>
<P>
   ``Another important aspect of this project is the educational
one,'' said Becker, who works with Parmenter out of the DFG's
Bishop office. ``Not just what we can learn. I mean we're actually
going out to schools and teaching kids about this plan and why it
works. Are we influencing the ranchers of tomorrow? You bet.''
</P>
<P>
   But there are future obstacles _ cattle trespassers, not enough
manpower to quickly get at fences when they fall into disrepair and
the impacts of years of overgrazing are among the largest.
</P>
<P>
   ``People have this picture in mind from the movies where the
cowboys were riding with their cattle all the time,'' Becker said.
``Today they kind of check on them, so, if a fence falls, it's
usually not one cow that gets in but a few.'' &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &QL; 
IF YOU'RE GOING
</P>
<P>
   To reach Pickel Meadow and the revamped section of the West
Walker River, drive highways 14 and 395 past Bridgeport_ some 350
miles north of the San Fernando Valley _ and turn west onto Highway
108 at Sonora Junction.
</P>
<P>
   The project area is upstream from where the 108 crosses the
river, all of which is open to public fishing; access is where you
can see the river from the road.
</P>
<P>
   Rainbow trout are the mainstay residents, planted in the river's
upper reaches; wild trout swim in the faster, boulder-strewn areas
around Sonora Bridge, closer to Highway 395. Browns are available,
too, and Lahontan cutthroats have been stocked the last two years.
Native mountain whitefish can be found in the long, calm pools of
the flat, green meadows.
</P>
<P>
   Five trout can be kept per day, 10 can be in possession.

ANOTHER TRAGEDY IS SEARED INTO MEMORY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By JOHN LEVESQUE  
 c.1999 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEATTLE _ Reality can be exceedingly brutal, but necessarily so
for those of us who tend to be unmoved by human tragedy. Daily
newspapers deal with death and disaster all too regularly. Taking
an obituary is as routine for us as covering a baseball game. It's
alarmingly easy for journalists to seem insensitive, or at least
somewhat less than compassionate.
</P>
<P>
   The last time a news event made me cry was when the space
shuttle Challenger exploded in 1986. I chalked it up to being like
most people who grew up in the Space Age. I'd dreamed of being an
astronaut. I'd even applied for the Journalist in Space program.
</P>
<P>
   Tuesday afternoon, the tears came again as I watched a teenager
describe how she almost died at school. Sobbing non-stop, she
described how a boy pointed a shotgun at her head ``and asked if we
all wanted to die.'' She said she screamed and begged him to spare
her life. He did. Instead, he shot a girl and a boy who were next
to her.
</P>
<P>
   I doubt if the horror of that event will ever leave her. Heck,
I'm more than a thousand miles away and I know the image will never
leave me. Just as that crazy white cloud in the brilliant sky above
Florida is forever imprinted in my mind, that girl's face _ the
hysterical eyes, the trembling lips _ will be with me for a very
long time.
</P>
<P>
   It speaks to the immediate power of television. And to its
greatest weakness.
</P>
<P>
   In the span of a few hours Tuesday, that interview with the
horrified girl was played repeatedly because, quite simply, it was
one of the best visual images available as networks and local
affiliates scrambled to make sense of the gruesome news unfolding
at Columbine High School in Littleton, Colo.
</P>
<P>
   But as we've all learned in these situations, precious few
details surface in the minutes immediately after the event. So a
handful of images are repeated again and again, to desensitizing
effect, because this is the time when wall-to-wall coverage is
considered virtually essential. Never mind that a common by-product
of such saturation is speculation, hearsay, rumor and bad judgment.
(At least one anchor in Seattle reported that authorities had
``confirmed'' 25 people were killed in the Littleton bloodbath,
even though it was widely reported that the number was an
estimate.)
</P>
<P>
   The obsession with being first rather than right is what damages
so much TV coverage during big news stories like Littleton. As I
watched coverage of Tuesday's massacre, much of it detached,
breathless and sensational, I thought back 12 years to when I was
running a small-town daily in the Midwest. On a spring day not
unlike Tuesday, an accident killed a railroad worker and it
happened right on our deadline. We pieced together a story for the
next day's paper _ still not knowing the identity of the victim _
and as the edition rolled off the press we found satisfaction in
knowing we'd beaten our competition to the story.
</P>
<P>
   The self-congratulatory reverie ended abruptly when the identity
of the victim became known. He was the father of one of our
co-workers. To say I didn't feel a twinge of guilt about our
``scoop'' would be a lie. Not that we'd gotten anything wrong. The
story was accurate, but I was troubled by the way I'd viewed it
earlier in the day. In newsroom jargon, it was a ``fatal'' on the
tracks outside of town. In reality, it was somebody's dad.
</P>
<P>
   I like to think the heightened awareness I took from that
experience made me a better journalist. But I'm sorry that the
price of my awareness was so dear, and that in the rush to report,
other journalists are still missing the big story.
</P>
<P>
   Ready for a big turnoff?
</P>
<P>
   Since 1995, an estimated 12 million people have experimented
with a TV-free lifestyle by taking part in National TV-Turnoff
Week. It's not the sort of thing a TV critic should do if he wants
to keep his job, but as one who spends way too much time in front
of the tube, I can heartily endorse the idea of some time away from
it.
</P>
<P>
   Thursday begins the fifth National TV-Turnoff Week. It is
sponsored by TV-Free America, a non-profit group that thinks too
much TV turns Johnny's brain to tapioca. Some days, I could be the
poster child.
</P>
<P>
   Though the organizers would be delighted if we all took our TVs
to the landfill, they present TV-Turnoff Week as a more moderate
effort to reduce the amount of television-watching in America. The
emphasis goes beyond complaints about programming, focusing instead
on the things that TV-viewing might displace, such as creativity,
productivity, healthy physical activity, civic engagement, thinking
and doing. Some of TVFA's suggestions: Visit the library, listen to
music, plant a garden, go dancing, play the piano, go fishing,
repair a bicycle, invent something.
</P>
<P>
   To get involved, all you have to do is not watch TV between now
and April 28. Or you can consider joining TV-Free America or
becoming a local organizer of TV-Turnoff Week. For details, call
202-887-0436, e-mail tvfa &LR; essential.org, or write TV-Free America,
1611 Connecticut Ave. NW, Suite 3A, Washington, DC 20009.
</P>
<P>
   Keeping a civil tongue
</P>
<P>
   Reaction to Monday's column about coarse language on prime-time
network shows was swift, overwhelming and delightfully civil. The
consensus is summed up in this e-mail from a reader in Olalla,
Wash.: ``You'd think TV producers would catch on to the fact that
one reason people don't watch programs is because of degrading and
uncivil language. Not only is it coarse, it's boring and shows a
lack of enough brains to produce an interesting vocabulary. Also,
it's their no-brainer substitute for good plots.''
</P>
<P>
   Many readers asked for network addresses so they could vent _
politely, of course. The networks don't make it easy for viewers to
send e-mail, but some of their Web sites offer opportunities to
direct electronic correspondence to specific programs. None offers
an easy mail drop for general correspondence.

 &HT;    Officials begin removing bodies from Columbine High School
 &HT;    By Chris Barker
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   LITTLETON, Colo. _ Authorities on Wednesday afternoon began the
grim task of removing the bodies of 15 people killed at Columbine
High School, as details about the shooting and police rescue of
students emerged.
</P>
<P>
   Students Dylan Klebold, 17, and Eric Harris, 18, who authorities
believe carried out the carnage Tuesday before killing themselves
inside the suburban Denver school, may have had help, investigators
said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're not sure two could carry all those explosives in,'' said
Jefferson County Sheriff John Stone. Officials said the arsenal
used to kill 12 students and one teacher included:
</P>
<P>
   _ 30 bombs, some equipped with timing devices. The cache, found
throughout the school, was made up of two types of pipe bombs and
several homemade bombs constructed from propane gas cylinders.
Nails were used for shrapnel.
</P>
<P>
   _ One 9 mm ``assault-weapon style'' semiautomatic rifle.
</P>
<P>
   _ Two pistol grip shotguns.
</P>
<P>
   _ One handgun.
</P>
<P>
   _ At least 100 rounds of ammunition stored in spare clips.
</P>
<P>
   The identities of the victims are still being withheld,
officials said.
</P>
<P>
   First Judicial District Attorney David Thomas said he would
``pursue vigorously'' the possibility that others may have been
involved in planning the attack or at least have known it was going
to happen.
</P>
<P>
   The attack began about 11:30 a.m. Tuesday, minutes after a bomb
exploded in a field about one and a half miles from Columbine,
officials said. That blast was likely meant to be a diversion for
the school attack, authorities said.
</P>
<P>
   Gunfire was reported inside the school until about12:30 p.m., as
nearly 2,000 students rushed to escape the melee, said Steve Davis,
spokesman for the Jefferson County Sheriff's Office.
</P>
<P>
   Three Jefferson County deputies, including one based inside the
school, returned fire, providing cover for fire vehicles and an
armored car to help usher injured teens to safety, officials said.
</P>
<P>
   A ``makeshift SWAT team'' was inside the building within 20
minutes of the first report of shots fired, Davis said.
</P>
<P>
   A surreal scene unfolded as officers walked through the halls.
</P>
<P>
   ``There were kids hopping out from under desks and from out of
broom closets,'' said Sgt. George Hinkle of the Lakewood Police
Department's SWAT team.
</P>
<P>
   Students called for help on cellular phones and the Internet,
Hinkle said.
</P>
<P>
   The families of the victims had all been notified as of
Wednesday afternoon, officials said.
</P>
<P>
   Hundreds of students visited a park near the high school on
Wednesday, putting up memorials of flowers, cards and signs,
embracing one another, crying and singing songs.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's shocking,'' said Deborah Barnes, mother of a 15-year-old
Columbine student. ``You don't know until you actually put your
arms around your child if they're OK.''
</P>
<P>
   Healing won't come quickly to the upper-middle-class community.
</P>
<P>
   Columbine will remain closed for an undetermined amount of time,
Jefferson County school administrators said Wednesday. The
districts remaining 14 schools will reopen today with increased
security and supervision, said Rick Kaufman, a spokesman for the
district.
</P>
<P>
   Authorities shed no light Wednesday on a motive for the crime,
but said there were signs the two boys could make trouble.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have a real concern with people who identify themselves with
heros like Adolph Hitler,'' Stone said.
</P>
<P>
   Several students said Klebold and Harris were part of a group
that worshiped Hitler, whose 110th birthday fell on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Other investigators said generalizations about what has been
termed the ``Trench Coat Mafia'' may be inaccurate.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of kids wear black clothes and Doc Martens,'' said
Thomas, the district attorney. ``I don't want to make more out of
this than there is.''

DESPITE YELTSIN, PROSECUTOR INVESTIGATING KREMLIN RETAINS POST 
</HEADLINE>
  (js) 
 By MICHAEL WINES   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   MOSCOW _ The upper house of parliament rejected both lobbying
and a personal plea from President Boris Yeltsin Wednesday and
voted lopsidedly, for the second time, to retain a prosecutor
investigating corruption at the heart of the Kremlin.
</P>
<P>
   The 79-61 vote was a serious setback for Yeltsin, who has been
striving to rebuild both the illusion and the reality of political
clout in order to resist impeachment and a steady erosion of his
authority.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, it seemed a clear victory for the Communists
who back the prosecutor, Yuri I. Skuratov, and who are leading the
impeachment drive. It also may have lifted the fortunes of Prime
Minister Yevgeny M. Primakov, who has gained power with every ball
Yeltsin has dropped.
</P>
<P>
   Yeltsin had sought to enlist Moscow's powerful mayor, Yuri M.
Luzhkov, and had dangled the prospect of expanded powers before
members of the upper house in a bid for their support in the battle
over Skuratov.
</P>
<P>
   In the end, however, the legislators decided to retain Skuratov
as general prosecutor, the nation's top law-enforcement post. It
was the second such vote; on March 17, the same chamber rejected
Yeltsin's first effort to dismiss Skuratov by an even more
one-sided vote.
</P>
<P>
   Skuratov has been embroiled since January in a bitter and
sometimes seamy war with Yeltsin and his aides over control of the
prosecutor's office _ and indirectly, of an inquiry into rake-offs
by unidentified officials in Yeltsin's administration.
</P>
<P>
   Despite a battle that has been splayed across the nation's
newspapers and on state television, which not so long ago broadcast
a videotape of Skuratov in bed with two prostitutes, the targets of
that inquiry have never been identified.
</P>
<P>
   Skuratov did not identify them again on Wednesday. To do so
before his inquiry was finished ``would be fatal to the country,''
he said.
</P>
<P>
   Luzhkov said later that ``the law triumphed today,'' and he
urged Yeltsin to give Skuratov time to complete his investigation.
</P>
<P>
   However, it was not clear that the law, Skuratov's inquiry or
even Skuratov's future had much to do with Wednesday's vote. The
question instead seemed to be whether Yeltsin had the power to
resist yet another encroachment on his turf: this time, his control
over the administration of justice.
</P>
<P>
   It now appears that he did not.
</P>
<P>
   The corruption inquiry may have lost a bit of its sex appeal
Wednesday when Skuratov reportedly acknowledged to legislators that
it does not involve Yeltsin or any members of his family. Skuratov
had been tracing money held in Swiss bank accounts by the Russian
elite, and speculation was widespread that Yeltsin's daughter and
confidante, Tatyana Dyachenko, was under investigation.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Not many analysts expect Skuratov to remain in his job for long.
Skuratov said Wednesday that he had been unable to work with other
investigative agencies in Yeltsin's government and that he would
support an independent corruption inquiry run by members of the
upper house of parliament.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, his credibility has been seriously undermined by the
broadcast videotape of his liaison with the two women, which some
say was part of a blackmail scheme unrelated to his Kremlin
investigation.
</P>
<P>
   Even though he retains his job, Skuratov remains under
suspension while another agency investigates the circumstances
surrounding that liaison. One popular theory Wednesday was that
Skuratov would resign soon in favor of a replacement dictated not
by Yeltsin, but by the upper house.
</P>
<P>
   At the least, Wednesday's vote confirmed how dramatically
Yeltsin has lost influence among the regional governors who compose
the upper house of the legislature and who have been his strongest
supporters.
</P>
<P>
   That is doubly important because it is the upper house's duty to
stage a trial should Russia's lower house of parliament, which is
dominated by Communists, decide to impeach Yeltsin. The lower house
has scheduled a mid-May vote on five impeachment charges against
Yeltsin, but before Wednesday, the prospects that the Communists
could actually force a trial seemed remote.
</P>
<P>
   Now, experts are not so certain. Some saw in Wednesday's vote
the deft hand of Luzhkov, himself a presidential aspirant, who is
expected to have a strong say in whoever succeeds Skuratov. Others
saw it as a victory for Primakov, who consolidated his grip on the
government during Yeltsin's long bout of illness last winter and
seems reluctant to surrender it now.

RISING CRIME DEFINES PRESIDENTIAL CAMPAIGN IN ARGENTINA 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By CLIFFORD KRAUSS   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   BUENOS AIRES, Argentina _ Crime is emerging as a major political
issue for the first time in the big cities of Argentina, a country
where people have traditionally stayed out well past midnight to
hop from cafes to tango clubs without a fear in the world.
</P>
<P>
   The issue is filling a vacuum in an otherwise listless campaign
to succeed President Carlos Saul Menem in which the two leading
candidates generally agree on economic and social policy. It is a
touchy issue for both candidates: Buenos Aires Mayor Fernando de la
Rua and Gov. Eduardo Duhalde, who is responsible for governing the
province surrounding the capital.
</P>
<P>
   Neither presidential candidate is blaming the other for the
crime wave, apparently for fear that such a charge could backfire.
De la Rua, the Alianza candidate, has come under fire from critics
for an increase in Buenos Aires street prostitution under his
watch. Critics of Duhalde, the front-runner for the Justicialist
Party nomination, have attributed a rise in crime around his
province to his purging of his corrupt and violent provincial
police.
</P>
<P>
   But with recent polls showing that crime is the No. 2 concern of
Argentine voters, after unemployment, advisers to the two
candidates are drawing up detailed anti-crime programs that will
include shaking up Argentina's corrupt and underpaid police
departments and court systems.
</P>
<P>
   In recent weeks, members of Congress of the ruling Justicialist
Party and the opposition Alianza coalition have traded barbs
accusing each other of being soft on crime, but they joined
together to lengthen prison sentences for juvenile offenders and
people found concealing guns without a license.
</P>
<P>
   Menem is prohibited by the constitution from running for a third
consecutive term, but many of his backers hope he can still file a
successful legal challenge before the Supreme Court and compete in
the October balloting. Menem has been sending mixed signals about
his political intentions, but he seems to be trying to capitalize
on the growing concerns about crime to help consolidate his control
over his party, if nothing else.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am not willing to watch unmoved the spectacle of a country
where politicians speak while innocent people die,'' he said in a
recent interview, in which he made specific reference to the
successes the New York City police have had in bringing down New
York's crime rate. This week he transferred more than 1,500 border
police and navy military police to help patrol the streets of
Buenos Aires.
</P>
<P>
   De la Rua's vice presidential candidate, Carlos ``Chacho''
Alvarez, criticized the president's move, warning that ``we should
not militarize the conflict.'' And De la Rua suggested that crime
was rising because the government was ineffective at fighting
poverty.
</P>
<P>
   Menem responded in an open letter, published in the local press
on Wednesday, scolding the mayor for ``confusing the dignity of the
poor with the pathology of delinquency.''
</P>
<P>
   While preparing for his run for president, Duhalde made a
pilgrimage to New York a year ago to be photographed with Mayor
Rudolph Giuliani and receive a briefing on the city's successful
anti-crime strategies.
</P>
<P>
   Ever since, Duhalde has included references in his stump
speeches to ``zero tolerance'' _ the policing theory, made popular
in New York, that a crackdown on small crimes contributes to a
decrease of more violent crimes. Meanwhile, De la Rua had a
well-publicized breakfast here in November with a former New York
City police commissioner, William Bratton, in which they discussed
crime strategy.
</P>
<P>
   ``I told him that I was impressed with the visibility of the
police,'' Bratton said in a telephone interview, ``but I wasn't
sure they knew what they were doing.''
</P>
<P>
   Bratton noted that Argentina, like other countries emerging from
military dictatorships, was struggling to make its security forces
more responsive to community needs while coordinating their
operations more effectively with civilian prosecutors.
</P>
<P>
   In recent weeks, the public has been bombarded with crime
stories in the media, including one about a serial killer on the
loose in the beach resort of Mar del Plata, and others about daily
holdups in Buenos Aires restaurants, banks and discotheques. Fear
of crime has even spread to pristine Patagonia, where, in the city
of Neuquen, police have begun searching pedestrians waiting at taxi
stands for concealed guns.
</P>
<P>
   Argentina remains one of Latin America's safer countries, and
Buenos Aires has nowhere near the crime problem of Caracas,
Venezuela; Mexico City, or Rio de Janeiro, Brazil. Still, the
Buenos Aires daily La Nacion recently published a front-page
article with statistics leaked by the government indicating that
incidents of serious reported crimes in Buenos Aires doubled
between 1995 and 1998, from 480,000 to 960,000.

TROUT TO TAKE BAIT WITH MORE ZEAL
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By BRETT PAULY  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ There are anglers and there are Eastern Sierra
trout anglers.
</P>
<P>
   And with Saturday marking the first day of fishing way up
Highway 395 in Inyo and Mono counties, the green flag is being
unfurled for the latter.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is the beginning of the rumble,'' said Steve Ellis,
proprietor of Fishermen's Spot in Van Nuys, who will continue his
streak of making the opening-day pilgrimage for more than 20 years
running.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are people who fish year-round, everywhere, sure,''
Ellis explained. ``But there are other people who come out of
hibernation starting around the end of March. These are the people
who fish only between the opener and the (Oct. 31) closer in the
Eastern Sierra, and they don't think fishing exists anytime or
anywhere else.''
</P>
<P>
   That's the type of obsessive-compulsive behavior I can
appreciate. And this opener should be particularly productive for
the purists.
</P>
<P>
   A mild winter and a quick thaw of ice-covered lakes began the
feeding instincts in trout early this year, making them more apt to
attack worms, Power Bait, lures and flies. No, they won't be
jumping in the boat, but they're going to be aggressive.
</P>
<P>
   ``Many of the waters have not been frozen over for an extended
period of time. Because of that we are looking at the fish being
more active, feeding more and growing larger during the closed
(fishing) season,'' said Mike Haynie, senior hatchery supervisor
with the Department of Fish and Game in Bishop. ``The fish are
actively pursuing food, and so when bait or artificials are being
presented they are more tempted to take advantage of that as a food
opportunity.''
</P>
<P>
   Eastern Sierra anglers won't soon forget the 1998 trout opener,
when stubborn sheets of ice kept Convict Lake closed to the public.
Crowley Lake thawed the Thursday afternoon before the traditional
fourth Saturday of April opener.
</P>
<P>
   The frigid conditions prompted many Southland residents _ who
make up some 80 percent of the 30,000 to 40,000 or more travelers
traditionally drawn to the trout opener _ to break tradition and
stay home last year.
</P>
<P>
   It appears they knew what they were doing; studies show that the
later the ice thaws, the longer it takes for anglers to catch a
five-trout limit on opening day at Crowley, because the
cold-blooded animals are more sluggish as they shed their
wintertime dormancy.
</P>
<P>
   Not this year.
</P>
<P>
   La Nina's below-normal precipitation left less than 50 percent
of normal snowpack in some parts of the Eastern Sierra and major
roadside lakes have been free of ice for weeks. Crowley, for
example, thawed March 3 and was covered only sporadically in the
late fall and early winter, giving trout a head start by allowing
them to warm up, pursue food and grow.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm predicting an average opener with above average fish,
which makes for a pretty good time,'' said DFG fishery biologist
Curtis Milliron, who specializes in Crowley Lake trout research.
</P>
<P>
   In other words, Crowley anglers likely will catch a trout an
hour at an average of 1.1 or 1.2 pounds apiece. The long-term
average weight is just about a pound per fish.
</P>
<P>
   Nearly 90 percent of the take will come from the 400,000
rainbows planted in August and September that now measure 12 to 13{
inches _ slightly longer than the norm; the day's bruiser rainbows
will be among the 10 percent or so caught after surviving the
entire 1998 fishing season. (The lake's heaviest fish ranged from
4.2 to 7 pounds during the past four openers.) Wild brown trout
will compose less than 3 to 4 percent of the opening catch, varying
in size from 12 to 24 inches; a 4.52-pound brown was the lake's
opening-day whopper in 1995.
</P>
<P>
   For opening day, each angler can expect to put 4.7 to 4.9 trout
on their stringer at Crowley.
</P>
<P>
   Some optimistic anglers believe the warmer climate will
stimulate strikes from bigger fish that are often tougher to catch
and content to laze around deeper waters.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think you are going to see some monster fish, 10- and
12-pounders,'' said Todd Treharne, a manager at Kittredge Sports in
Mammoth Lakes. ``The water temperatures will be up and the fish are
going to be a lot more active and will have already started a
seasonal feeding pattern.''
</P>
<P>
   Eastern Sierra residents are looking forward to what should
promise to be a ``real'' summer.
</P>
<P>
   ``With El Nino (two winters past, when some parts of the Eastern
Sierra received more than 200 percent of normal snowpack), we
didn't really have a summer last year,'' Treharne said. ``You get a
lot of cabin fever when you're looking at 10 feet of snow on Main
Street on the Fourth of July.
</P>
<P>
   ``This year will be different; we're really looking forward to
it. We're getting a lot more calls for accommodations for this
opener; it seems bookings are up in town from last year.''
</P>
<P>
   As a result of the mellow winter and early spring, all area
campgrounds scheduled to be operational in time for the opener are
free of snow and ready to accommodate RVs and tents.
</P>
<P>
   But be certain to pack a worthy windbreaker along with the
tackle box; on Saturday winds out of the northwest should blow from
15 to 30 mph in the Owens Valley and higher Eastern Sierra locales.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have a low-pressure system coming down through Nevada and
into Northern Arizona and going on to the east through the weekend
that will be bringing cooler temperatures and the winds,'' said
Ernie Cobb, a forecaster with the National Weather Service in Las
Vegas.
</P>
<P>
   Temperatures should range from the mid-30s to the mid-60s in the
Owens Valley and from 30 to the low 50s higher up at Crowley Lake,
Mammoth Lakes and the Mono Basin. Though no precipitation is
predicted, expect cloudy skies.
</P>
<P>
   Anglers may be interested to learn three strains of rainbow will
be caught Saturday at Crowley, each with its own distinct
characteristics:
</P>
<P>
   _The long, slender Kamloop rainbow is quite a leaper when
hooked, ``the most aerobatic strain,'' Milliron said. ``Kamloops
are especially crazed, great fighters.'' They tend to hug the bank,
within 10 feet of the shore, so don't overcast, the biologist
suggested. About 100,000 were planted last year.
</P>
<P>
   _The Coleman rainbow (150,000 stocked in 1998) suspend in more
open, deeper waters and are the most frequent strain boated by the
trolling angler.
</P>
<P>
   _The strain with the greatest ability to dodge hooks its first
year in the lake and carryover until a second or third season is
the Eagle Lake rainbow, making them mostly in the 2- to 4-pound
range when finally caught. Bottom feeders, they are taken with
equal abundance from shore and trolling.
</P>
<P>
   Milliron offers one other tip for Crowley anglers: While quite a
few spring spawners _ Kamloop and Eagle Lake rainbows _ are in the
lake's tributaries, the streams are vehemently protected by various
regulations, including catch-and-release restrictions, so be
very-well versed in the DFG's sport-fishing code.
</P>
<P>
   And, as always, tight lines.

EVERY 15 MINUTES, STUDENTS GET A GRIM REMINDER ABOUT DRUNKEN
DRIVING
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By DAVE FERMAN 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   CROWLEY, Texas _ At precisely 9:45 a.m., the Grim Reaper came
for Hilaree Hawkins _ down the halls of Crowley High School and
right into her class. Hawkins, a 17-year-old senior, went quietly;
as she left, a Crowley police officer entered the class and read
her obituary aloud to her classmates.
</P>
<P>
   All day long, the ritual continued: The tall man in the black,
hooded robe (carrying a scythe, no less) entering a classroom, the
student getting up silently and leaving, the police officer
solemnly reading the obituary.
</P>
<P>
   The Reaper was punctual. He interrupted a class to snatch away a
student once every 15 minutes _ the frequency with which someone in
America is killed by a drunken driver.
</P>
<P>
   This was precisely the point of ``Every 15 Minutes,'' a program
involving about 35 Crowley High students _ and many of their
parents, who wrote the obituaries. Sponsored by C.R.A.S.H.
(Communities for Responsible Auto Safety Habits), ``Every 15
Minutes'' is a Tarrant County-wide, multiorganizational initiative
designed to make teens aware of the dangers involved in drinking
and driving. C.R.A.S.H. even included a simulated alcohol-related
car wreck (complete with ambulances and a helicopter ambulance
taking a victim away) in front of the school.
</P>
<P>
   The students who participated in the program were taken to a
nearby hotel, where speakers and counselors discussed the
consequences of alcohol and drugs. The second day featured an
assembly during which the ``dead'' students were returned to the
student body, and trauma-treatment and legal professionals talked
about the consequences of drinking and driving.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can't ever make it real enough for kids, but this is the
best way we can show them'' the effects of drinking and driving,
says Karen Pfleger, trauma program coordinator at Harris Methodist
Fort Worth hospital. ``I'd like to stand all of them in a trauma
room when a victim of a drunk driver comes in, but you can't do
that. You can't just tell them not to drink and drive. You have to
show them the consequences.''
</P>
<P>
   The visit to Crowley High School was the first such program put
on by C.R.A.S.H., which formed last year and is made up of
representatives from the hospital, area police and fire
departments, the Metroplex chapter of Mothers Against Drunk Driving
and the Texas Department of Transportation. The organization's goal
is to ``decrease teen motor vehicle fatality and injury in Tarrant
Country,'' said to Debbie Phillips, Harris Methodist's manager of
community health and education.
</P>
<P>
   ``Every 15 Minutes'' was initiated by the Chico, Calif., Police
Department in 1995. Last year, the Mansfield Police Department
staged one at Mansfield High School, which is how C.R.A.S.H. heard
about it. ``We decided it'd be a good way to reach a lot of
students,'' Phillips says. ``The Mansfield police felt it really
reached out to a lot of students; kids remembered the program three
and four months later.''
</P>
<P>
   After all, who can forget a helicopter landing in the parking
lot? About 10 a.m. on the day of the program, the students were
told there was a car crash in front of the school; they walked out
to see a car and a station wagon nose to nose, with a ``dead''
student (17-year-old junior Ben Barnett) lying in front of them,
his head in a pool of blood.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it's cool to be part of a program that reinforces how
bad drinking and driving is,'' Barnett says. ``I hope people see
how real it can be, how it can happen.''
</P>
<P>
   Within minutes, police cars, two ambulances and a CareFlite
helicopter had arrived to ferry away the faux-injured, who included
one young man with a severed arm, which lay on the hood of the car.
A police officer opened the station wagon door; out spilled liquor
bottles and beer cans, and Phillips' 18-year-old daughter, Sarah,
playing the drunk who caused the wreck. She was led away in
handcuffs, just as Barnett was covered with a white sheet, which at
least momentarily cut way down on the amount of talking in the
crowd.
</P>
<P>
   Daniel Mooney stood nearby, watching his son, Brandon, an
18-year-old senior, lie still in the car. He wanted his son to
participate in the program because ``he needs to realize one or two
drinks does matter. This can be a good experience for him.''
</P>
<P>
   Writing his son's obituary, he says, was ``depressing, for lack
of a better word. It was hard to do; his mother and I probably
spent 12 to 15 hours on it. It's not something you do every day.''
He says it has led the two of them to talk about drinking and
driving. ``He's hoping it'll open some eyes,'' Mooney says. ``We've
talked about what we'd do without him. If it makes one child take
this seriously, it'll be worth the time and the effort.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It's scary; it makes you realize what can happen,'' says
Martha Mahanay, an 18-year-old senior. ``It was realistic. I hope
it got through to people _ to have something like this happen in
our school would be awful. I think it'll touch some people.''

CLEARING BOMBS FROM COLORADO SCHOOL DELAYS INVESTIGATION 

</HEADLINE>

<P>
   LITTLETON, Colo. _ Before investigators were allowed into
Columbine High School to collect evidence and remove bodies
Wednesday, specialists spent hours sweeping the campus for
explosives left during a shooting and bombing attack.
</P>
<P>
   ``We didn't want anyone to go back into that building until the
bomb team felt it was safe,'' said Jefferson County sheriff's
office spokesman Steve Davis. ``That's what's been taking so much
time last night and today.''
</P>
<P>
   Technicians in bomb suits, recruited from several agencies
around Littleton, searched the facility using bomb-sniffing dogs
and remote-controlled robots.
</P>
<P>
   Investigators found long rifles, semiautomatic handguns and
about 30 explosive devices _ including pipe bombs set off several
miles from the school 15 minutes before the rampage Tuesday.
Officials believe those were a diversion to distract emergency
personnel during the attack on the school. No one was injured at
that site.
</P>
<P>
   Detectives were cleared to enter the building and begin their
investigation about noon Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Officials found ingredients they said could be used in
explosives at the homes of Columbine students Eric Harris, 18, and
Dylan Klebold, 17, whom police have identified as the gunmen. Their
bodies were found in the school, and authorities believe they shot
themselves.
</P>
<P>
   Harris and Klebold, members of an outcast group known as the
``Trenchcoat Mafia,'' stormed the school about 11:30 a.m. Tuesday
wearing masks and black clothing.
</P>
<P>
   Hundreds of students and faculty clambered for the exits while
others hid as the pair sprayed gunfire at lockers and hallways and
set off the bombs.
</P>
<P>
   Almost half the school's 1,870 students were eating lunch and
were trapped in the cafeteria as the armed students entered. Most
of the victims were found in the cafeteria and second-floor
library, where Harris and Klebold also were found dead.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the explosive devices were in duffel bags and on the
floors inside the school. Officials believe Harris and Klebold
brought the bombs with them.
</P>
<P>
   Although preliminary investigations suggest that the two acted
alone, Jefferson County District Attorney Dave Thomas said it is
possible others may have helped construct the bombs. If so, the
others could face criminal charges.
</P>
<P>
   Searchers used protective clothing and other bomb retardant
equipment, robots and dogs trained to sniff out explosives.
</P>
<P>
   The remote-controlled robots are guided into areas using video
screens to detect bombs without endangering humans.
</P>
<P>
   Only two or three bombs were detonated during the attack, but
another went off in a parking lot Tuesday night, Westminster Police
Spokeswoman Jacki Tallman said. No one was injured then.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the devices were pipe bombs, but investigators also
found what Tallman described only as a ``gas-type'' bomb and a
``propane-type'' bomb in two cars.
</P>
<P>
   The bombs could have been made using chemicals found under a
typical kitchen sink or purchased at hardware stores. Recipes for
the deadly concoctions can be found in books and on the Internet.

 &HT;    Intervention can help deflect violence spurred by alienation
 &HT;    By Bo Emerson
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ The American teen-ager. Yearning to stand out, and
desperate to fit in. Struggling to be a rebel, yet terrified of
losing status with the cool group. It is an age of alienation.
</P>
<P>
   A sense of being on the outside looking in is ``typical in
adolescence, from 12 to 18,'' says Dr. Michael Popkin, an Atlanta
psychologist who deals with teens. Such alienation breeds feelings
of rejection, he says, which is why movies such as ``Carrie'' _ the
fiery 1976 revenge fantasy of an outcast girl, a remake of which
was recently released _ are so popular.
</P>
<P>
   But fantasies don't kill teen-agers.
</P>
<P>
   On Monday a pair of Colorado high school students described by
their peers as ``freaks'' and ``outcasts,'' kids who wore black and
fancied themselves as rebels, turned their anxiety into a
bloodbath.
</P>
<P>
   What makes a troubled kid cross the line into real anger, and
real violence? And how can we intervene?
</P>
<P>
   ``Our problem is we haven't even looked at that question
enough,'' says Iris Bolton, executive director of The LINK
Counselling Center, a nonprofit center that focuses on suicide
prevention and children in crisis.
</P>
<P>
   Bolton suggests that many schools will respond by putting up
metal detectors to protect themselves from killer students. A more
useful approach, she says, would be to learn how youngsters are
driven to despair, and to rescue them beforehand.
</P>
<P>
   That means targeting teens prone to violence, whether against
themselves or against others. Isolated kids often gather to create
their own group, a place to belong, which can also be a hotbed for
violent action.
</P>
<P>
   ``You might get goaded by other members of the gang, or be dared
to take action,'' says Popkin. ``My hunch is when they get to the
bottom of this (Colorado) investigation, there will be other people
implicated in this, who might have been pushing them.''
</P>
<P>
   The two students accused in the Colorado shootings called
themselves the Trench Coat Mafia and dressed in black trench coats.
They were called ``goths'' by fellow students. Goths, a subculture
that grew out of the punk movement, affect black clothing, a gloomy
attitude and a fascination with Victorian poets and such champions
of the morose as Edgar Allan Poe and Anne Rice.
</P>
<P>
   But clothes don't necessarily provide a clue to the wearer, and
psychologists point out that plenty of other folks also dress all
in black
</P>
<P>
   ``Most goths do wear all black,'' but so do most art directors,
says Carissa Craig, who helps organize the goth night at the
Masquerade venue in Atlanta. ``Everyone is very offended at the
gothic term being brought up in relation to this crime,'' she says.
</P>
<P>
   The Trench Coat Mafia borrowed not only gothic affectations but
elements of white supremacy, which has nothing to do with goth
ethos.
</P>
<P>
   Recognizing the warning signs is crucial, but the problem, say
experts, is that many of us are too busy to see what's going on in
the lives of those around us.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our relationships are superficial,'' says Dara Gocheski, 18, a
senior at Marietta High School. ``We never pay attention to see
what makes people tick.''
</P>
<P>
   Quentin Thompson, 18, is a senior on the Marietta High School
track team. ``I was wondering if any of the kids I know would flip
out like that, because I know some kids like that who get teased a
lot.
</P>
<P>
   ``I never know who at Marietta is carrying a gun.''
</P>
<P>
   Appearances are deceiving.
</P>
<P>
   Linda Cornelius had two sons. One was a punk rocker who shaved
his head and broke his nose stage diving. The other was a Sunday
school honor student and an acolyte in the Episcopal church.
``Which one of those took his own life?'' asks Cornelius.
</P>
<P>
   Five years ago, Ryan Cornelius, the ``good'' kid, stole his
father's pistol, found the key to a locked box of bullets, and shot
himself. Her son, it turns out, had been tormented most of his
school life by bullies and was severely depressed. And his mother
never knew it.
</P>
<P>
   Her tragedy spurred Cornelius to become involved with the
Suicide Prevention Advocacy Network, and her experiences there
convince her that a screening for depression could help many
potentially troubled high school kids.
</P>
<P>
   But much youth violence is impulsive, says Dr. Rodney Hammond,
director of the Division of Violence Prevention at the Centers for
Disease Control and Prevention, and difficult to predict.
</P>
<P>
   Early research indicates that there are risk factors that
increase an adolescent's chances of committing violence against
himself or others, says Hammond, including violent attitudes, a
history of threats and access to firearms.
</P>
<P>
   While youth violence in general is dropping, the incidents of
multiple homicides is actually rising, says Hammond, a figure that
worries CDC officials. Yet the attention on violence in schools
disguises the fact that less than 1 percent of violent deaths of
those 18 or younger occur in school-related settings. Most occur at
home or in the community.
</P>
<P>
   Professionals such as Hammond see prevention as the key to
dealing with youth violence. But, says Bolton, prevention begins
with discussion. Teachers and parents must acknowledge the threat
of suicide and violence. Students who are warned regularly about
drugs and alcohol need to be trained just as vigorously in dealing
with anger.
</P>
<P>
   ``Instead of focusing on what can the president say to console
us, and what can we put into the schools to protect this from
happening, lets talk about why does it happen in the first place,''
says Cornelius. ``It's a taboo subject.''
</P>
<P>
   Judging from her own experience, Cornelius says the events in
Colorado will have one positive result. ``Once a suicide occurs,
then people learn the warning signs of depression,'' she says,
adding, ``don't ignore them. Don't think it's a joke if someone
says 'if I don't pass this test I'm going to kill myself.'''
</P>
<P>
   ``This community can survive this and make meaning out of it.

WORLD EVENTS REQUIRE DISCREET CHANGE OF TONE FOR NATO `GALA' 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By FRANCIS X. CLINES   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The word ``gala'' still appears on some official
schedules of NATO's 50th anniversary celebration. But the word
rings unseemly now as the bombs continue to fall on Yugoslavia from
NATO warplanes.
</P>
<P>
   As workmen hammered and vacuumed and U.S. Marines stood guard at
the celebration hall Wednesday, the grimmer reality of that
uncertain war already was in the air of the anniversary setting,
like crepe where bunting was once intended.
</P>
<P>
   Two days before the opening ceremony of welcome to 44 summit
delegations, the schedule of events has been discreetly altered to
allow for shifts in tone and emphasis in the face of the open-ended
aerial assaults that, far from being a crowning anniversary
success, have called NATO's very future into question.
</P>
<P>
   For one thing, the bombing briefing by NATO's now familiar
spokesmen on the war will be held right here at the commemoration's
media center as a kind of Orwellian prelude to the day's speeches
and events. For another, the planned outdoor opening ceremony,
replete with a thundering flyover of NATO warplanes as a
heavyweight television anchor waxed historic, has been scrapped.
Instead, there will be a three-hour jubilation-free indoor working
meeting on the harrowing snares of NATO's confrontation of Yugoslav
President Slobodan Milosevic.
</P>
<P>
   Black-tie formal wear has been ruled out at the two White House
dinners in favor of the more sober imagery of business attire. And
officials said there was a likelihood that the three-day gathering
would offer an added agenda item _the catastrophic refugee
sufferings of Kosovo's Albanians _ as the heart of its final
working session Sunday and thus the parting image of its
commemoration.
</P>
<P>
   ``Five months ago when we were planning this, it was going to be
much more of an occasion to look at the successes of the past and
to try to put a matrix around the challenges of the future,'' said
Richard Socarides, the special assistant to President Clinton who
is the NATO summit's chief operating officer. ``Now, of course, the
weekend will be much more oriented to the present. The foreign
policy challenges are being played out in real time.''
</P>
<P>
   Attempts to screen out suggestions of global junketeering in the
historic commemoration have not been entirely successful. On
Wednesday afternoon, the fact sheet handed out to some of the more
than 2,000 workers of the world news media arriving to cover the
event began with the question: ``How do I get into the press party
on Thursday night?'' (``To get three free drinks, you must have the
Media Reception card,'' the answer emphasized.)
</P>
<P>
   With security ultratight and no events accessible to the public,
NATO will be presenting a hermetic television event. The images of
diplomacy and the speeches of resolve _ all 19 NATO heads of state
are expected to give opening speeches _ will vie with the daily
feeds from the air war that, NATO officials emphasize, will be
going on even as they talk.
</P>
<P>
   ``The mood will be serious, dignified and focused,'' declared
Socarides, who said the president was receiving lengthy briefings
and was looking forward to the summit meeting as an opportunity to
rally the alliance.
</P>
<P>
   The working sessions will be held in what is now called Andrew
Mellon Auditorium, formerly Departmental Auditorium, where the NATO
alliance was signed into being on April 4, 1949, as the bulwark
against the Soviet Union after World War II. The hall, which faces
the National Museum of American History across Constitution Avenue,
had previously served as the site of the Selective Service draft
when American troops last fought in Europe.
</P>
<P>
   Fifty years ago, President Truman and the other signers presided
over what was then the first event of its kind to be broadcast live
in its entirety to the nation in a display of NATO's determination
to protect the world. Delegates sat in gold-colored chairs. These
have been reupholstered for the 50th anniversary gathering where
tiny Kosovo, not global communism, is the haunting theme.
</P>
<P>
   Months ago, planners were polishing an ambitious, optimistic
agenda emphasizing the need for closer cooperation with Russia and
for a decision on theoretical questions about the future role of
NATO, and whether and how it might ever have to enter combat beyond
the borders of its member nations. That question has since been put
to the test in Kosovo to the considerable fury of Russia, which,
even as the first delegates were arriving with hopes of possible
Kremlin mediation, declined to attend.
</P>
<P>
   The ultimate question lurking about the commemoration is whether
NATO might cross the Balkan Rubicon and send ground troops into the
costly, inconclusive fray. In the passing crowds outside the NATO
hall Wednesday, before a cocoon of security closed off the downtown
heart of the capital, fit young NATO soldiers behaved like
tourists, stopping to snap photographs against a backdrop of
history.

 &HT;    Colorado governor vows to veto bill that halts lawsuit against
gunmakers
 &HT;    By C. Patrick Cleary
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   DENVER _ Gov. Bill Owens Wednesday said he will veto a bill that
would prohibit municipalities from suing gun manufacturers.
</P>
<P>
   And two other gun-related bills still before the Legislature
will not move forward, the sponsors said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   The moves come as Coloradans tried to deal with the aftermath of
the massacre at Columbine High School in Littleton.
</P>
<P>
   Owens, a Republican, also set aside $1 million Wednesday to
assist the victims' families. The money also could also be used to
repair Columbine High School, which Jefferson County School
District officials say may not reopen this school year.
</P>
<P>
   Owens said he will veto Senate Bill 205, sponsored by state Sen.
Ron Teck, R-Grand Junction, because of constitutional questions
about the bill.
</P>
<P>
   The bill would prohibit municipalities from suing gun
manufacturers if weapons are used in the commission of crimes.
</P>
<P>
   ``My attorney has briefed me during the last couple weeks,''
Owens said during a Wednesday afternoon press conference at the
capitol. ``There are serious constitutional questions. I will veto
it.''
</P>
<P>
   Owens said he also supports the decision to table the two other
bills. Senate Bill 84 would have authorized residents free of a
criminal record and who complete a training course to carry
concealed weapons. House Bill 1305 would have standardized firearms
regulations across Colorado.
</P>
<P>
   State House Speaker Russell George, R-Rifle, said he had been
trying since Tuesday to convince legislators to drop the bills.
Owens said in light of what happened in Littleton, he's not sure
what form, if ever, the bills would return.
</P>
<P>
   The Legislature and governor's office have already started to
look at how other states reacted to school shootings to see what
direction to take.
</P>
<P>
   George said the issues range from school uniforms to finding
more money for security. State Rep. Matt Smith, R-Grand Junction,
said he believes the Legislature immediately will see a request for
more support for private and charter schools. Whether anything can
be accomplished during the two remaining weeks of the session is
not certain, Smith said.
</P>
<P>
   ``The questions of school safety are at the forefront of parents
checking their kids into school,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Owens said he set aside the $1 million in assistance so the
multitude of officials involved can do as much possible to deal
with the crisis. ``We need to do whatever we can to mitigate what
is before us,'' he said.

LATEST SHOOTINGS INFLAME GUN-CONTROL DEBATE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By THOMAS FARRAGHER  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Colorado's high school massacre stoked the nation's
already fiery gun-control debate Wednesday as lawmakers pressed
anew for strict controls on access to firearms. But, they conceded,
the rule of law is little match for random violence.
</P>
<P>
   ``Perhaps the most important thing all of us can do right now is
to reach out to each other and to families and children,''
President Clinton said. ``It is very important to explain to
children all over America what has happened and to reassure our own
children that they are safe.''
</P>
<P>
   As the president pledged his administration's swift support to
help Littleton, Colo., cope with the tragedy, his spokesman
reaffirmed Clinton's commitment to measures that would hold adults
criminally liable for allowing easy access to guns, provide firearm
safety locks, and establish a lifetime gun-possession ban for those
who commit violent crimes.
</P>
<P>
   ``Let me emphasize that it's unclear that any of these would
relate directly to the incident that we are going through now,''
said Joe Lockhart, the White House spokesman.
</P>
<P>
   Across Capitol Hill Wednesday gun-control advocates used the
shootings half a continent away to bolster their case for some of
the 50 gun-control bills now pending before Congress, while
acknowledging that legislation alone will not control the carnage
that has erupted in schools from Alaska to Arkansas, Oregon to
Kentucky.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is not enough to wring our hands and pray it won't happen
again,'' said Senator Charles Schumer, a New York Democrat. ``We
need to act. Let's resolve to work together to do what is necessary
to protect our children. Let us focus on better counseling,
documentation of hate groups with the school, encouraging students
to come forward, and much better laws to prevent kids from getting
guns.''
</P>
<P>
   Schumer, who has introduced legislation that would ban
unlicensed Internet sales of weapons, said, ``We must accept that
any solutions must involve a change in gun laws.''
</P>
<P>
   Representative Patrick Kennedy, a Rhode Island Democrat, called
for education grants to pay for school violence prevention programs
and legislation that would automatically revoke licenses from
dealers who sell firearms to underage buyers.
</P>
<P>
   Kristen Rand, director of federal policy for the Violence Policy
Center, said the Colorado slayings will galvanize efforts to
oversee a gun industry that she called the nation's last
unregulated consumer-product manufacturers.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it's finally beginning to sink in that if we don't
really start doing something, we are going to have to learn to live
with this _ and it's going to happen every couple of months,'' said
Rand.
</P>
<P>
   But Republican National Committee chairman Jim Nicholson, who
used to live five miles from Columbine High School, said it would
be wrong to make the killings in Colorado grist for speedy new
policy.
</P>
<P>
   ``Doubtless there will be those who will try to politicize these
tragic events, who will exploit our emotions in the furtherance of
simplistic political solutions,'' Nicholson said in a statement.
``Americans know better. We're not even able to formulate the
questions about Wednesday's tragedy, much less learn the answers.''

   In Colorado, Governor Bill Owens would not say whether he will
continue to support a bill that would make it easier to carry a
concealed weapon. ``We have tight, tough gun-control laws here in
Jefferson County in the state of Colorado right now,'' Owens said
on ``Good Morning America.'' ``They broke those laws. They broke
laws concerning the making of guns. They broke laws concerning that
we shall not kill. I'm not sure that they would have obeyed a
further law.''

   The concealed weapons bill was one of two gun proposals
withdrawn Wednesday by their sponsors in the Colorado Legislature.

   Some members of Congress expressed frustration that six months
after a White House conference on school violence underscored the
need for intervention for troubled students, and training to
recognize early warning signs of potential violent behavior, there
is no way to legislate away senseless shootings.
</P>
<P>
   ``These kinds of horrors are the expression of deeply troubled
people, and they're affected by so many different factors that it's
hard to say with any confidence that we know how exactly to prevent
them,'' said Senator Joseph I. Lieberman, a Connecticut Democrat.

NEW FOX CARTOON MOCKS TV, `THE SIMPSONS'
</HEADLINE>

<P>
   Like its animated counterpart ``The Simpsons,'' Fox's new
cartoon sitcom ``Family Guy'' isn't afraid to worship at the feet
of its maker ... the almighty idiot box.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, so much of ``Family Guy'' is devoted to parodying or
lauding television, the show promises to be for the little screen
what ``The Critic'' was for the big. (The series had a sneak
preview after the Super Bowl in January, but is only now settling
in for its regular run.)
</P>
<P>
   From its ``All in the Family''-style opening theme song to the
obligatory reference to Fox's ``reality programming'' specials (in
this case, ``Fast Animals, Slow Children)'' _ ``Family Guy's''
premiere makes for a scathingly funny look at our media-obsessed
society. In fact, a recent episode revolved around, believe it or
not, television. When the town's cable dish was accidentally
knocked out, viewers were forced to come to grips with their
airwave addiction.
</P>
<P>
   But just as ``Futurama,'' the new Spage-Agey cartoon from
``Simpsons'' creator Matt Groening, struggles to escape the shadow
of TV's foremost 'toon family, ``Family Guy'' also displays a
Simpsonesque influence. The family guy himself is Peter Griffin,
the patriarch of a typically dysfunctional American household (kind
of like Homer). Wife Lois is the lovable, levelheaded one (kind of
like Marge); daughter Meg is the smart, underappreciated kid (kind
of like Lisa); and Chris is the dim-bulb slacker (kind of like
Bart). The only characters who stray from ``The Simpsons'' formula
are the toddler and the family pet. They are the show's most
endearing and interesting characters.
</P>
<P>
   Whereas Maggie remains mute, content to suck on her pacifier,
baby Stewie is a precociously verbose conniver bent on taking over
the world. And although Santa's Little Helper may be the only
Simpson who's dumber than Homer, the Griffins' pooch is the
brainiest member of the household, happy to sip martinis and read
the paper while dispensing clever bons mots.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the obvious lifts from other series, you can't deny that
some of the TV parodies the family watches are pretty dead-on _
especially an amusing send-up of William Shatner's Captain Kirk and
an update of ``Scooby-Doo.'' (Yep, that's the voice of the original
Freddy, Frank Welker.)
</P>
<P>
   Show creator Seth MacFarlane lends his voice to all the main
characters except for Lois, voiced by Alex Borstein. And if
MacFarlane can keep the TV skewers as sharp as in the premiere,
this show's got more of a future than ``Futurama.''

<TEXT>
<P>
   FRANKFURT, Germany _ A year ago, even a month ago, it still
seemed unthinkable. Wednesday, it began to look unavoidable.
</P>
<P>
   The planned merger between Deutsche Telekom AG and Telecom
Italia, which were both government-owned telephone monopolies until
very recently, would be more than just another record-breaking
corporate deal.
</P>
<P>
   Beyond its sheer scale, the pact demolishes many of the European
taboos against cross-border mergers in politically sensitive
industries. It also sets the stage for a new series of big
telecommunications takeovers, much as the regional Bell companies
jumped into each other's arms in the United States.
</P>
<P>
   What is most remarkable about the deal between Deutsche Telekom
and Telecom Italia is how little political opposition it has
ignited. Even more than big banks and car companies, European
telephone companies have been national enterprises that remain
under heavy political control by their governments.
</P>
<P>
   Yet despite some last-minute angst by Italian officials about
``selling out to the German government,'' both governments were
more worried about letting their telephone companies become too
weak than about giving up national control.
</P>
<P>
   The surprisingly passive reaction reflects two big changes. The
first is the onslaught of new competition in the year since most
European governments opened their telephone markets to rivals for
the first time.
</P>
<P>
   Deutsche Telekom, which presides over Europe's biggest and
wealthiest telephone market, has lost 30 percent of its
long-distance market to new rivals and been forced to slash some of
its prices by 70 percent. Most of Europe's other telephone
companies are bracing for similar attacks.
</P>
<P>
   The second big change is the unrivaled new influence of
international shareholders and global capital markets. Faced with
the need to raise billions of dollars to finance expansion,
European corporations of all types are relying far more heavily on
global public stock and bond offerings than they did in the past.
</P>
<P>
   At a time when the shares of DaimlerChrysler and Deutsche
Telekom trade in New York and Tokyo as well as Frankfurt, survival
depends far more on profitability than nationality.
</P>
<P>
   That has changed the rules of the game. Companies that alienate
shareholders, most of whom have no interest at all in a stock's
nationality, risk being cut off from major sources of capital. Or,
as in the case of Telecom Italia, they become vulnerable to a brash
hostile takeover attempt.
</P>
<P>
   The changes have come at a curious historical juncture. Most
European countries, including Germany and Italy, have elected new
left-of-center governments in the last two years. Yet Europe's
corporate culture, consumed with hostile takeovers and gigantic
mergers, increasingly mirrors that of Wall Street.
</P>
<P>
   ``The speed of the deal making is increasing as the intensity of
the competition is increasing,'' said Scott Beardsley, a
telecommunications consultant at McKinsey &AMP; Co. in Brussels. ``The
incumbents are facing wrenching changes in their markets, not only
in the sense of competitors but from investors as well.''
</P>
<P>
   It remains far from clear that shareholders will be smitten by
the proposed megamerger. Many analysts are skeptical that a
trans-Alpine telephone giant will be able to fend off competitors
any more effectively than the two companies on their own. And they
note both companies still have a lot of restructuring work in front
of them.
</P>
<P>
   But the merger would at least create a company with additional
scale, which could help it shave costs in buying equipment. And the
merged company would have a big base on which to build a
pan-European telecommunications network to compete with the likes
of the alliance between British Telecommunications and AT&AMP;T Corp.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is an industrial logic, because their purchasing power
rises substantially,'' said Juergen Roethig, head of securities
trading at Metzler Securities, a private bank in Frankfurt.
</P>
<P>
   Most analysts caution that the savings are not likely to add up
to more than 1 percent of revenues, and that the promised synergies
between the two companies will not come easily.
</P>
<P>
   The two companies have very different telephone systems and
corporate cultures. They are supervised by very different
regulators. And because Germany and Italy do not share a border,
the two companies will not necessarily enjoy big advantages in
connecting their networks together.
</P>
<P>
   The merger could also be blocked or altered by competition
authorities at the European Commission in Brussels. A trade group
representing competitors to Deutsche Telekom announced Wednesday
that it would ask the regulators to intervene and warned that the
merger would ``greatly endanger the competition that is just now
getting under way in Europe.''
</P>
<P>
   Karel van Miert, Europe's minister of competition, had already
indicated this week that the deal would not be approved unless the
companies pared off at least some of their holdings. Deutsche
Telekom would be forced to give up its stake in Wind, a new
competitive phone company in Italy, but it might also be forced to
make other concessions.
</P>
<P>
   Even assuming the deal is approved, the two companies face big
restructurings. Analysts say Deutsche Telekom's costs are still too
high, given the price reductions it has had to swallow in response
to its new competitors. Deutsche Telekom's revenues declined nearly
7 percent in the first three months of this year, to 16.1 billion
marks ($8.75 billion), from 17.3 billion marks in the comparable
period a year earlier; profit was flat at 1.04 billion marks.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Telecom Italia needs to cut costs as well, but it also needs to
divest marginal businesses in equipment manufacturing, real estate
and financial services.
</P>
<P>
   ``It will be a really tough challenge,'' said Francois
Travaille, a telecommunications industry analyst at Banque
Nationale de Paris.
</P>
<P>
   The cultural differences are mind-boggling. Under the plan,
Deutsche Telekom's tough and austere chairman, Ron Sommer, would
share power with Telecom Italia's chief, Franco Bernabe. Somehow,
the two would have to decide how best to shed tens of thousands of
additional jobs and to merge management teams that speak different
languages and will be battling each other for jobs.
</P>
<P>
   The tensions have been apparent as Telecom Italia's board
agonized over the merger offer this week. Fearful of simply being
acquired by the German government, the board demanded that the
German government limit its voting power and clarify its plans to
sell off part of its stake. They also insisted &QL; 
that the job of company chairman should rotate regularly between
executives from each company.
</P>
<P>
   In the end, the German government refused to limit its voting
rights or to reduce its stake more quickly than originally planned.
But it insisted that it remained committed to the full
privatization of Deutsche Telekom and had no interest in taking
over control of day-to-day operations.
</P>
<P>
   Even Wednesday night, after three days of deliberations, Telecom
Italia board members appeared nervous about the deal and hesitated
about issuing any public statements. But they were also apparently
ready to accept it.
</P>
<P>
   Many industry analysts and executives contend that Deutsche
Telekom is acting more out of opportunism than strategy. Bernabe of
Telecom Italia has been desperately looking for a white knight to
prevent his company from being taken over by Olivetti, the
electronic equipment and telecommunications company that made a
hostile takeover bid worth more than $60 billion.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, the German telephone company appears to be on the prowl
for other big acquisitions, which it would finance in part by
selling more than $10 billion worth of new shares this year.
</P>
<P>
   There have been numerous reports in the German media that
Deutsche Telekom would like to buy Sprint Corp., the third-largest
American long-distance carrier in which both Deutsche Telekom and
France Telecom already own 10 percent stakes. But it has been
extremely cautious about committing itself to any further
entanglement with Sprint. Deutsche Telekom has also held extensive
talks with Cable &AMP; Wireless PLC, according to German newspapers.
</P>
<P>
   Whatever happens, industry executives say the merger frenzy in
European telecommunications still has a long way to go. Mannesmann,
one of Telekom's biggest competitors, acquired the network owned by
O.Tel.O, Germany's third-largest telephone competitor. With about
50 new rivals in Germany alone, more such deals are likely.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, analysts say smaller traditional telephone carriers,
like those in the Netherlands or Austria, may feel pressured to
look for partners. The telephone companies of Sweden and Norway are
already merging, and Tele-Denmark is now controlled by Ameritech,
regional Bell company based in Chicago.
</P>
<P>
   All Europe seems already to be looking beyond this deal to the
next step. For even if the prospective marriage between the Italian
and German phone companies falls through, the mere fact that it got
this far suggests that European business has now crossed the
Rubicon.

U.S. IS PRESSED TO CONSIDER GROUND TROOPS FOR KOSOVO
</HEADLINE>
   (sw) 
 By MICHAEL R. GORDON and CRAIG WHITNEY   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   BRUSSELS, Belgium _ Britain and France are pressing the United
States to seriously consider sending ground forces into Kosovo. But
as leaders of the NATO nations begin gathering here on the eve of
the alliance's 50th anniversary summit, their differences are so
pronounced that the matter has been left off the agenda.
</P>
<P>
   The Clinton administration seems to be extremely wary about
suggestions that ground troops might have to go into Kosovo. One
senior official said he worried about a situation in which NATO
troops found themselves mired in a guerrilla war with Serb
renegades.
</P>
<P>
   ``The problem is not fighting your way in; it is what happens
after you get there,'' the official said.
</P>
<P>
   Nonetheless, Washington signalled some flexibility on Wednesday
night, saying it favored a broad NATO review of options developed
last summer on the use of ground troops in Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   The behind-the-scenes debate broke out into the open this week
in a coordinated series of statements by Britain's prime minister,
defense minister and foreign minister.
</P>
<P>
   With four weeks of bombing attacks already behind them, they
argued that weeks, if not months, of sustained bombing might
sufficiently weaken the Serb military so that NATO ground forces
could move into Kosovo and establish order with limited
casualities. The scenario has been discussed so much in the
corridors of NATO headquarters here that it even has a name: ``a
semi-permissive environment.''
</P>
<P>
   The British proposal would be a major shift from the NATO's
current plan, which is to send in a peacekeeping force of 28,000
troops, but only if President Slobodan Milosevic withdraws his
forces from Kosovo and accepts a peace settlement that allows the
1.8 million ethnic Albanians to return to their shattered homes.
</P>
<P>
   As Robin Cook, Britain's foreign minister put it Tuesday in an
address to the House of Commons, it is possible to ``conceive of
circumstances in which it may be feasible to commit ground
troops.''
</P>
<P>
   The main condition would be the assurance that NATO's force were
not facing ``organized armed resistance.'' As British officials
tell it, Milosevic would not be given a ``veto'' over the
introduction of allied ground troops.
</P>
<P>
   The British are not alone in pressing for the possible
introduction of ground forces. President Jacques Chirac of France
said in a televised speech Wednesday night that the alliance should
apply ``additional means'' besides escalating the air war to stop
``massacres, rapes, burned villages, families separated and thrown
onto the roads.''
</P>
<P>
   French officials said Chirac's statement was an allusion to
ground forces, and that France's plan was to seek a U.N. Security
Council resolution mandating such a force.
</P>
<P>
   In Washington, the entire question of ground forces going into
potential combat in Kosovo has been highly sensitive. American
officials have sought to avoid public discussion of the matter.
Defense Secretary William Cohen suggested on Wednesday that the
matter of ground troops did not need to be decided because Gen.
Wesley K. Clark, the NATO commander, had not officially requested
authority to plan a military operation using combat forces.
</P>
<P>
   Left unstated was the fact that NATO's military commander was
not about to propose a major escalation in the fighting unless the
United States, the leader of the alliance, was behind it and was
ready to use its political influence to build support for a
decision to send in ground troops.
</P>
<P>
   But after saying for weeks that no such planning was necessary,
the White House said on Wednesday that it was time to study the
size and composition of the forces that would be needed.
</P>
<P>
   ``The U.S. would certainly support as a prudent measure any
updating of the assessments of the use of ground troops in a
permissive and non-permissive environment,'' the White House
official said on Wednesday evening. ``It would be irresponsible for
us not to periodically update our plans.''
</P>
<P>
   The allies were not the only ones the Clinton administration
appeared to have in mind. Sen. John McCain, R-Ariz., who is seeking
the Republican presidential nomination, has lambasted the Clinton
dministration for starting an air campaign against Yugoslavia
without a backup plan for combat troops.
</P>
<P>
   Certainly, all the allies agree the bombing needs to go on for a
long time. Clark has repeatedly argued that the bombing campaign
has to have time to do its work and that it is too early to say if
it will succeed.
</P>
<P>
   On Wednesday night, the 29th day of bombing, allied planes hit
the headquarters of Milosevic's party in Belgrade, a
glass-and-steel 23-story building that also housed three local
television and radio stations.
</P>
<P>
   Defense Minister George Robertson of Britain described the
building as ``one of the nerve centers of the machine which plans
the killing in Kosovo.''
</P>
<P>
   Nonetheless, Western diplomats say Clark has told allied leaders
that he cannot guarantee that bombing attacks alone will compel
Milosevic to withdraw Serbian troops from Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Despite this, NATO nations have yet to ask him to draw up a new
plan to send in combat troops, nor has he asked for the authority
to begin planning.
</P>
<P>
   The review of military options, which the Clinton administration
says it now supports, stops considerably short of that.
</P>
<P>
   Even if there was a plan, lengthy preparations would be needed
to assemble the force. Even then, no ground attack could be carried
out without the approval of the entire 19-member alliance.
</P>
<P>
   In the absence of an agreement, diplomats here initially sought
to paper over their differences. But lately, the British have
insisted that ground troops might be needed to bring the war to an
end.
</P>
<P>
   Toward that end, Prime Minister Tony Blair met with Clinton here
Wednesday night in an apparent effort to persuade him to do more to
actively prepare in case land forces were needed.
</P>
<P>
   Blair made the case for this after meeting at NATO headquarters
with l Clark on Tuesday. He drew a distinction between sending in
ground troops against tough Serb resistance and sending them in
after punishing NATO bombing had taken the fight out of them.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have always made clear the difficulties of putting in
ground forces as a land force invasion against undegraded organized
Serb resistence,'' Blair said. ``We have also equally made it clear
that the international military force is there to allow people to
go back to their homes.''
</P>
<P>
   Going in on the ground would mark a huge departure for NATO,
which has been as preoccupied with maintaining public support at
home for the military campaign as in taking the war to Serb forces.
</P>
<P>
   Chancellor Gerhard Schroder of Germany would probably be in
favor of sending ground troops to Kosovo, but one European official
sepculated that Foreign Minister Joschka Fischer's Greens Party
might break apart over the issue, collapsing the government.
</P>
<P>
   Canada would not oppose an alliance consensus, Prime Minister
Jean Chretien said in Montreal on Tuesday. ``If everyone is in
agreement, I will not be the only one disagreeing,'' Chretien said.
</P>
<P>
   The French position is less bold than it seems. French officials
say that France would be prepared to send in troops but only with a
mandate for such a force from the U.N. Security Council, which
would require persuading Russia not to use its veto power there.
</P>
<P>
   That would be a tall order since Moscow is adamantly opposed to
any force that does not have Milosevic's approval.
</P>
<P>
   NATO members will have ample opportunity to debate the issue at
the summit. Their foreign ministers and defense ministers will also
have separate meetings of their own on Friday.
</P>
<P>
   ``The issue of ground troops is not on the agenda in Washington,
but the leaders are certainly going to be talking about it, in
bilateral meetings, over dinner, informally,'' a high European
official of the alliance said.
</P>
<P>
   ``The British, the French and the Turks might all be willing to
go in with ground troops,'' he added. ``Others are more reticient.
But what do the Americans want?''
</P>
<P>
   The Clinton administration has been reluctant to take the lead
in thinking about a land operation.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is an American-led organization,'' the senior European
official said. ``If the Americans said we can't let Milosevic get
away with this, we've got to go in with ground troops, then each
country would have to consider the issue and make a decision. And
we could agree that only the countries that wanted to would
contribute.''

 &HT;    Icons of teen angst pose as prophets of alienation
 &HT;    By Steve Dollar
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Teen-age alienation isn't what it used to be.
</P>
<P>
   Throughout popular culture's catalog of images and attitudes, it
has become a much more extreme proposition. Inevitably, teen-age
alienation is also part of the landscape against which events like
Tuesday's Colorado school shootings take place.
</P>
<P>
   To get an idea of how far the envelope has been pushed, think
back to James Dean, the sensitive, sensual ``Rebel Without a
Cause'' in the epochal 1955 drama. He looks positively quaint when
you compare the film to some of its '90s counterparts. The amoral
universe of Larry Clark's 1995 ``Kids,'' for instance, is a
latchkey generation apocalypse, in which promiscuous teens and
preteens drift through a haze of drugs and sex _ unblinkingly
clouded by the shadow of AIDS.
</P>
<P>
   Dean lived fast and died young, true to formula for romantic
myth. But he died in a car accident. The 1990s version is the saga
of Nirvana singer Kurt Cobain, whose wrenching howl and knack for
fusing Beatlesque melody with a barrage of feedback was a catharsis
for his own troubled youth. Cobain ended his life with a shotgun
blast in 1994 at age 27, immortalizing himself _ for many of his
younger fans _ as a prophet of alienation and anxiety.
</P>
<P>
   Classic American blues and country music wouldn't be the same
without these weighty themes, but then seminal Delta bluesman
Robert Johnson and Appalachian banjo wizard Dock Boggs, who often
sang about death, Satan, sex and murder, among other things, didn't
have MTV to promote them. They were just dealing with life as they
knew it, projecting a little bit, and carrying forth traditions
with links to Africa and Scotland. And it's hard to imagine how
these Smithsonian-approved folk legends would look in
buttocks-baring Spandex.
</P>
<P>
   To wit: The success of a performer such as Marilyn Manson, who
capitalizes on the same themes, substituting theatrical shock
tactics and professional cynicism for Nirvana's earnest angst. Yet,
there's a strong appeal for disenfranchised kids inherent in
Manson's concept albums. ``Antichrist Superstar,'' the 1996 album
that brought the singer into the pop mainstream, is a
semi-autobiographical fantasy in which an outcast, high school
``worm'' transforms into an avenging angel (and big-time rock
star). Last year's ``Mechanical Animals'' swaps the gothic chic
that had characterized Manson's image for the androgynous duds of
'70s glam-rock. But the sci-fi psychodrama offers consistent
touchstones: anger at the embalming grip of authority, the idea of
the singer as the faceless spawn of a meaningless society.
</P>
<P>
   Manson, ultimately, fancies himself as an ubermensch. The
current kings of teen-age rage are self-conscious losers with lots
of issues: the members of California hard-rock band Korn. ``Every
time I start to believe, something's raped and taken from me,''
rails lead vocalist Jon Davis on the new single ``Freak on a
Leash.'' Korn's latest album, ``Follow the Leader,'' is rife with
images of childhood abuse and sexual aggression, but the violence
most often seems to turn inward, and the sexuality is sometimes
ambiguous. These are songs that could have been written as therapy.
In fact, they are therapy, sung by a high school outsider who found
his way to the spotlight: ``In the past I was known as a freak, had
no friends, picked on cause I was weak/Sang my ass off got into
this band, never thought the band would become the man.''
</P>
<P>
   Music, though, seems less a focus for pundits trying to explain
the source of violent episodes than visual media. Reportedly, the
two students who launched Tuesday's assault were ardent competitors
in ultra-violent computer video games, in which animated gunmen mow
down scores of opponents.
</P>
<P>
   It was that medium that parents of three students killed Dec. 1,
1997, at Heath High School in Paducah, Ky., had in mind when they
recently filed a $130 million lawsuit. Targeted were makers of the
``Doom,'' ``Quake'' and ``Mortal Kombat'' games that the parents
contend influenced the killer. They also sued Time Warner and
Polygram Filmed Entertainment Distribution Inc., whose parent is
Seagram, for releasing ``The Basketball Diaries.'' In the 1995
film, Leonardo DiCaprio plays an adolescent heroin addict who _
during a dream sequence _ uses a pump-action shotgun to blast away
at high school students in a classroom.
</P>
<P>
   The high school as killing field theme has been recurrent in
recent films aimed at young audiences. In ``Disturbing Behavior,''
a school's picture-perfect teens are actually ``Stepford'' kids
drugged by their parents and a psychiatrist. But raging hormones
drive them batty, and the noninfected kids have to kill them off.
When the teachers in ``The Faculty'' turn out to be aliens, the
students have to destroy them. A pair of juvenile serial killers
replace the usual bogeyman in the tongue-in-cheek thriller
``Scream.'' Bad girls form a killer clique in ``Jawbreaker.''
</P>
<P>
   In each of these movies, though, elements of irony or the
fantastic create a sense of distance. Everyone is disposable _ even
Drew Barrymore, the big-name teen attraction who, surprise, gets
killed off in the opening sequence of ``Scream.''
</P>
<P>
   Unfortunately, kids get senselessly wiped out in real life, too.
And irony isn't bullet-proof.

RUBIN OFFERS PLAN FOR REDUCING GLOBAL CREDIT RISKS 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By DAVID E. SANGER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Treasury Secretary Robert Rubin outlined a modest
five-point U.S. plan Wednesday for warding off the kind of
financial crisis that rocked three continents over the last two
years. He called for strengthened financial disclosure rules and
guidelines that would ``discourage countries from taking too many
risks'' when they borrow money.
</P>
<P>
   But Rubin's proposals, which President Clinton endorsed in a
brief talk at the White House on Tuesday, fell well short of
creating the kind of new ``global financial architecture'' that
many policy-makers debated in the heat of the crisis in emerging
markets last fall. His ideas were chiefly modifications of existing
rules, more akin to rewiring a building than reconstructing it.
</P>
<P>
   At no time in his speech in Washington on Wednesday before the
Johns Hopkins School of Advanced International Studies did Rubin
repeat Clinton's frequent statement last fall that the world was
facing its ``deepest economic crisis in 50 years.'' In fact, many
U.S. and European officials fear that as Asia's immediate crisis
and the threat of economic contagion have receded, the political
momentum for far-reaching reforms may have been lost.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton warned Tuesday about the dangers of complacency and the
Treasury chief said Wednesday that he was concerned that in
financial markets ``even painful lessons recede from memory with
time.''
</P>
<P>
   Nonetheless, the proposals Rubin put forward were infused with
his characteristic caution about either overregulating markets or
expanding the powers of the International Monetary Fund in ways
that would signal investors they could count on being saved if a
nation appeared on the brink of default. The IMF _ which meets
along with the World Bank and the Group of Seven finance ministers
early next week _ has been the prime instrument for bailing out
ailing nations.
</P>
<P>
   The secretary made no mention Wednesday of turning the IMF into
a ``lender of last resort'' for nations on the brink of bankruptcy,
a proposal that some top officials of the fund have floated in
recent months. ``There was a range of views on that within the
Treasury,'' Rubin acknowledged in response to a question. But he
had opposed the idea, his aides say, fearing that if countries knew
that the IMF stood ready to prevent defaults, they would resume the
kind of reckless lending that helped Indonesia, South Korea, Russia
and Brazil get into trouble.
</P>
<P>
   Similarly, he rejected the imposition of any kind of capital
controls, rules that would limit the amount of money countries
borrow, and, in times of crisis, prevent investors from pulling
their money out. Such regulations, he said, ``can be used by
politicians as a substitute for real reform of their economies.''
</P>
<P>
   Instead Rubin focused on five areas of reform, some of which are
already under way: forcing lenders to pay a greater share of the
cost of bailing out nations, discouraging most countries from using
fixed exchange rates, encouraging nations to rely more on long-term
borrowing and less on short-term, disclosing more information about
outstanding debt, and protecting the poor and middle class during
crises.
</P>
<P>
   The first initiative arises from the sharp criticism directed at
both the United States and the IMF that they bailed out banks and
bondholders in Asia by insuring that they were repaid, but did far
less for workers who lost their jobs.
</P>
<P>
   Rubin said Wednesday that ``market discipline will work only if
creditors bear the consequences of the risks they take.'' He
suggested that in future bailouts, the bankers and investors who
lent money to a country would have to ``share the burden.'' But he
did not say how, and acknowledged that if the rules were too harsh,
lenders would steer clear of developing nations.
</P>
<P>
   He was clearer about exchange rates. ``At the center of each
recent crisis,'' Rubin said, ``has been a rigid exchange-rate
regime that proved ultimately unsustainable,'' a reference to the
efforts by many Asian nations and Russia to peg their currencies to
the dollar. He argued that the IMF and individual nations should no
provide money to help a country defend a fixed exchange rate,
except in rare circumstances.
</P>
<P>
   Rubin cautioned countries like Argentina that are considering
adopting the dollar as their currency, a step many nations see as a
way to bring stability to their economies. He said they would be
giving up virtually all domestic control over monetary policy,
which would be set by the Federal Reserve.
</P>
<P>
   And he warned that the Fed would manage the dollar to fit U.S.
economic interests _ and no one else's. It would not help supervise
foreign banks, he said, or change interest-rate policy to fit
another country's needs simply because it had adopted the dollar.
</P>
<P>
   Rubin was particularly careful in dealing with the question of
how to manage the $1.5 trillion that races around the globe each
day in currency transactions, purchases and investments. Saying
governments ``must do a better job of managing their own debt,'' he
warned them against borrowing too much short-term cash, rather than
paying more for long-term borrowing. Many nations found that, once
their currencies were devalued, they could not meet the short-term
debt payments.
</P>
<P>
   Rubin said that in some cases rules should be adopted to ``limit
banks' foreign currency exposures.'' But he did not describe those
rules. And while he warned nations against excessive borrowing, he
said the best way to deal with the problem was to require
countries, banks, securities houses and hedge funds to disclose
more data about how much debt they are carrying.
</P>
<P>
   He suggested that Clinton's Working Group on Financial Markets,
which he helps direct, would soon recommend tighter disclosure
rules for hedge funds like Long-Term Capital Management, which had
to be saved last fall from a multibillion-dollar default.
Investigations showed the lenders to Long-Term Capital did not
understand how much money the fund had quietly borrowed.

PLAN FOR GROUND TROOPS IN KOSOVO GAINS MOMENTUM 
 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By GREG McDONALD 
c. 1999 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Prospects for the commitment of ground troops in
Kosovo appeared to firm up Wednesday as allied officials suggested
they will seek authorization for an invasion plan when NATO leaders
meet Friday in Washington.
</P>
<P>
   At a briefing in London, British Defense Secretary George
Robertson said the planning for a ground commitment would be an
``integral part'' of deliberations at the three-day NATO summit.
</P>
<P>
   White House Press Secretary Joe Lockhart also said President
Clinton would support updating plans for a ground invasion if
NATO's supreme commander, Gen. Wesley Clark, asks for it, as
reports have indicated he will.
</P>
<P>
   The talk of a ground invasion came as the long-awaited U.S. Army
Apache attack helicopters, accompanied by 4,000 support troops and
ground missile launchers, began arriving in Tirana, Albania.
</P>
<P>
   The administration also announced Wednesday that it would bring
some refugees to the United States temporarily to relieve pressure
on nations such as Albania and Macedonia.
</P>
<P>
   The 24 helicopters along with an undisclosed number of Black
Hawk helicopters and other support aircraft are expected to launch
within a few days the first low-level attacks on Serb forces in
Kosovo since the allied bombardment of Yugoslavia began 29 days
ago.
</P>
<P>
   The air campaign continued Wednesday with some of the heaviest
attacks yet on the Yugoslav capital of Belgrade. Allied missiles
struck at Milosevic's Socialist Party headquarters, which Robertson
described as ``one of the nerve centers of the machine which plans
the killing in Kosovo.''
</P>
<P>
   At least three missiles hit the 23-story government building,
which also houses television and radio stations owned and
controlled by Milosevic's daughter Marija.
</P>
<P>
   ``Milosevic by now can be under no illusion that we mean
serious, unrelenting business. We are now striking at the very
heart of his bloodstained regime, and we'll do so again and again
and again,'' Robertson said.
</P>
<P>
   The NATO attacks Tuesday night and Wednesday focused again on
hitting communications relay sites, oil refineries, fuel and
ammunition supply facilities and factories suspected of producing
military-related goods.
</P>
<P>
   Allied planes also destroyed the last remaining bridge over the
Danube River at Novi Sad, Yugoslavia's second largest city,
severing the country's rail connection with Hungary and the rest of
Europe. Five other bridges were damaged along military resupply
routes into Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   The NATO strikes at the high-rise that houses Yugoslavia's
ruling party was aimed at taking out what alliance spokesman Jamie
Shea called Milosevic's ``propaganda machine.''
</P>
<P>
   Asked if NATO was trying to target buildings where Milosevic
might be hiding in an effort ``to take him out,'' Shea said that
killing Milosevic is not an objective of the allied assault.
</P>
<P>
   ``But we are certainly targeting the power structures that make
him what he is. We will go after anything which is used to plan, to
conceive, to direct what is a campaign of repression in Kosovo,''
Shea said.
</P>
<P>
   ``In other words, if I can take the image of the human body, we
will go for the brain as much as we'll go for the fingertips.''
</P>
<P>
   As part of an effort to intensify the air campaign, the Pentagon
awarded the Boeing Co. a $41 million contract Wednesday to convert
95 nuclear versions of air-launch cruise missiles to conventional
use. The move is designed to address a shortage of conventional
cruise missiles, which are no longer being produced because a new
generation of the weapon is being developed.
</P>
<P>
   The NATO allies also continued relief efforts aimed at feeding
and caring for over a half million Kosovar refugees driven from
their homes into Albania, Macedonia and Montenegro. Thousands have
been given sanctuary in Western countries, and Vice President Al
Gore announced in a visit to Ellis Island in New York that up to
20,000 of them will be airlifted to the United States to be housed
temporarily.
</P>
<P>
   A U.S. plan had originally called for placing them at Guantanamo
Bay naval base in Cuba, but that was scrapped when humanitarian
workers said it would amount to putting them in a guarded detention
center.
</P>
<P>
   Once here, the refugees will be allowed to apply for political
asylum. But Gore stressed that most would likely return to Kosovo
once the hostilities there have ended.

 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The Clinton's administration decision Wednesday to
allow 20,000 Kosovar refugees to settle temporarily in the United
States, a political about-face from a prior plan to put them at
Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, could bring a significant number of the
ethnic Albanians to Massachusetts.
</P>
<P>
   At least 15,000 Albanian-Americans, and possibly many more, live
in the Bay State, according to Anthony Athanas, the founder of
Anthony's Pier Four restaurant, who was born in Albania and came to
the United States when he was six years old.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm ready to do anything,'' said Athanas, who spoke with
President Clinton about the Kosovo situation when Clinton visited
Massachusetts last week.
</P>
<P>
   The decision also demonstrates that the administration believes
the war in the Balkans is going to last longer than originally
anticipated, analysts said. The new policy of bringing the refugees
to homes throughout the United States probably means that the
Kosovars' hope of returning to their homeland is, at best, many
months away.
</P>
<P>
   A State Department official said that under the family
reunification program, ethnic Albanians in camps in Macedonia who
want to relocate to the United States will be interviewed,
connected with American relatives, undergo a medical screening, and
be processed as refugees, or persons who have been persecuted in
their homeland.
</P>
<P>
   With refugee status, they will be eligible for a host of
social-welfare benefits, including food stamps, and entitled to
apply for permanent residency in the United States after one year.
</P>
<P>
   The 20,000 refugees will include some who don't have American
relatives but are deemed ``in vulnerable circumstances'' by State
Department and immigration officials, said Maria Cardona, a
spokeswoman for the Immigration and Naturalization Service.
</P>
<P>
   The refugees who volunteer will come only from camps in
Macedonia, a State Department official said, ``because we want to
relieve the strain there first.''
</P>
<P>
   The administration initially opposed having the refugees come to
the US mainland, saying that might give the impression Washington
was legitimizing the ``ethnic cleansing'' policy of Yugoslav
President Slobodan Milosevic.
</P>
<P>
   But the idea of housing the refugees at Guantanamo prompted
harsh criticism from human rights advocates who said the Kosovars
should be allowed to come to the US mainland rather than a
prison-like facility on a naval base.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a welcome change in policy,'' said Sherle
Schwenninger, a senior fellow at the World Policy Institute. He had
criticized the original plan of using Guantanamo, saying images of
refugees behind barbed wire would be a public relations disaster.
</P>
<P>
   ``The one thing the US is good at is opening itself up to
displaced people and refugees and immigrants,'' Schwenninger said.
</P>
<P>
   Families interested in hosting refugees will be able to call a
toll-free number that should be set up Thursday, the State
Department official said.
</P>
<P>
   US officials said they were not sure where the bulk of the
relocations would be, and they expected it would take several weeks
to get the refugee airlift under way.
</P>
<P>
   Senator Edward M. Kennedy, who has advocated bringing the
refugees to the United States, said: ``This action is certainly far
better than housing them in Guantanamo. It is important for
Americans to be at the forefront of the international effort to
meet the needs of the refugees and ease their suffering.''
</P>
<P>
   Azem Tachi of Worcester, Mass., a leader of the
Albanian-American community there, said he believes as many as 300
to 500 refugees could find temporary homes there and applauded the
decision by Clinton to allow them to come to the United States.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is good because these people might be able to work right
away and not be stuck in camps, and children can go to school. They
get back to life. It will be a big change for them. If things
straighten out in Kosovo, people will be elated to go back if they
want,'' he said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Tachi said there are about 2,600 residents of Albanian heritage
in the Worcester area and many are willing to help. A group there,
the New England Albanian Relief Organization (NEARO), has been
shipping food and clothing to Kosovo for years, he said, but even
more in recent weeks.

CLINTON IS SAID TO DECIDE AGAINST APPEALING CONTEMPT CITATION 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By JOHN M. BRODER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ President Clinton has all but decided not to appeal
a civil contempt of court ruling for what a federal judge called
intentional false testimony in the Paula Jones lawsuit, according
to senior Clinton advisers.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, these advisers said, Clinton and his lawyers were
relieved that the judge, Susan Webber Wright of U.S. District Court
in Little Rock, Ark., did not seek harsher sanctions against the
president in her April 12 ruling. Given what she called Clinton's
``false, misleading and evasive answers'' in a sworn deposition in
the Jones lawsuit in January 1998, Judge Wright could have leveled
criminal contempt charges or referred the matter to the Justice
Department for perjury prosecution.
</P>
<P>
   But a member of Clinton's legal team said the president's final
decision on an appeal could be affected by the financial costs
imposed as a result of the contempt citation. The adviser declined
to be identified because he said Clinton was not ready for the
decision to be announced.
</P>
<P>
   Judge Wright ordered the president to pay $1,202 to cover the
cost of her travel to Washington to preside over the deposition.
She also ordered him to reimburse Mrs. Jones' lawyers for
``reasonable'' costs incurred as a result of his false statements.
And the judge referred the matter to the professional conduct
committee of the Arkansas Supreme Court, which could disbar Clinton
or impose some lesser punishment.
</P>
<P>
   Judge Wright said Clinton repeatedly and willfully gave false
statements in the deposition when he denied a sexual relationship
with Monica Lewinsky and claimed not to remember having been alone
with Mrs. Lewinsky, a former White House intern, in the Oval
Office. It was the first time any president had been cited for
contempt of court.
</P>
<P>
   John Whitehead, one of several lawyers who represented Mrs.
Jones last year, said that by his preliminary accounting, Clinton's
false testimony cost $300,000 to $400,000. Whitehead said the
figure would probably be significantly higher when the fees of a
group of Dallas lawyers involved in the lawsuit were included.
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Jones' lawyers have until the end of next week to submit an
estimate of their costs. The president has 10 days after that to
respond to their demand.
</P>
<P>
   A Clinton adviser said that he thought fees approaching a
half-million dollars were ``crazy'' and would never be approved by
Judge Wright, whose ruling, although sharply written, imposed a
relatively modest punishment. If she does approve huge costs, the
adviser said, the president will challenge the fees and, if
unsuccessful, appeal the contempt ruling.
</P>
<P>
   The adviser added that Clinton might be willing to reimburse
expenses up to about $100,000 without challenge, to end the matter
and save the cost of additional litigation.
</P>
<P>
   Last November, the president paid Mrs. Jones $850,000 as part of
an out-of-court settlement of the case. Mrs. Jones sued Clinton in
1994, claiming he made a crude sexual advance in a Little Rock
hotel room when he was governor of Arkansas and she was a low-level
state employee.
</P>
<P>
   Legal scholars have questioned whether Judge Wright correctly
interpreted federal law in citing Clinton for civil contempt, a
tool generally used to compel testimony in ongoing court cases. The
ordinary remedies for refusing to testify, or testifying falsely,
are a criminal contempt charge or a perjury prosecution.
</P>
<P>
   But Clinton, on the advice of his lawyers, has chosen not to
challenge Judge Wright on her reading of the law, because the
alternatives to a civil contempt citation are much less attractive.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a classic case where we have to rise above
principle,'' a member of the Clinton defense team said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Many of last year's most bitter battles in the Lewinsky case
were fought precisely on issues that Clinton's lawyers asserted
were matters of high constitutional principle, including the claims
of various privileges protecting the president's confidential
conversations with aides.
</P>
<P>
   All these claims were challenged by Independent Counsel Kenneth
Starr and largely rejected by federal courts.

`PUSHING TIN' GETS OFF COURSE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By BOB STRAUSS  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ ``Pushing Tin'' pulls off the rather tough trick
of making us laugh at the wacky antics of air traffic controllers
without terrifying us into never getting on a plane again.
</P>
<P>
   It's somewhat less successful at keeping a quirky, shrewdly
detailed comic tone aloft throughout its two hour-plus running
time. There's at least half of a very clever, smart-spoken
character comedy here, but it has a midmovie collision with
something more conventional.
</P>
<P>
   Based on a New York Times Magazine article, the movie was
scripted by Glen and Les Charles (veterans of TV's ``MASH,''
``Taxi'' and ``Cheers'') and directed by the eclectic but
accomplished Mike Newell (``Donnie Brasco,'' ``Four Weddings and a
Funeral,'' ``Enchanted April'').
</P>
<P>
   There's no shortage of on-screen talent, either. John Cusack and
Billy Bob Thornton do what they do best _ for a while _ as two
hotshot radar jockeys embroiled in a droll but potentially deadly
game of psych-out one-upmanship. As their respective wives,
Australia's recent Oscar nominee Cate Blanchett is convincing, if
not exactly scintillating, as a Long Island housewife, and Angelina
Jolie (``Playing by Heart,'' HBO's ``Gia'' and ``George Wallace'')
is a scream as a belligerent, tattooed, borderline alcoholic,
aspiring social worker.
</P>
<P>
   And she's not even the most eccentric character. Just the most
obvious.
</P>
<P>
   Cusack's Nick ``The Zone'' Falzone is the star controller at New
York's bunkerlike Terminal Radar Approach Control center (TRACON
for short). The facility handles all traffic in and out of Kennedy,
LaGuardia and Newark airports, the busiest airspace on the
continent. One mistake in complicated flight-path calculations
means the loss of hundreds of lives, and the mental stress on the
controllers is understandably mighty.
</P>
<P>
   But no need to worry about Nick. A great early shot shows the
radar screen's reflection in his eye morphing into 3-D inside his
head, symbolizing how he has it all under control. Indeed, control
is Nick's self-defining trait. So, what if, after a long night
shift, he parks his car in the neighbor's driveway? At TRACON, he
has it all wired.
</P>
<P>
   Until, that is, Zen cowboy Russell Bell (Thornton) moseys in
from Denver. An unnervingly serene, half-Choctaw biker with a wild
hair reputation _ he once stood under a landing 747, just to get
bounced by its air displacement _ Bell loves to maneuver pilots
into sharp turns and tight patterns that even the Zone finds
audacious. He's also the living definition of passive
aggressiveness.
</P>
<P>
   Before long, the two men are not only competing at the job, but
on the road, under basketball hoops, at neighborhood piano bars
(Thornton sings a particularly winsome ``Muskrat Love'') and over
each other's wives.
</P>
<P>
   As long as these peculiar tests of masculine mettle are the main
subject, ``Pushing Tin'' is original and very amusing. While Zone
may be slightly outmatched by the unpredictable newcomer, they both
exhibit a wicked ingenuity when it comes to getting the other guy's
goat.
</P>
<P>
   These early reels are also when the controllers' sense of
community and gallows morale are depicted best. ``He's paid so
well,'' one third wife of an overworked tin-pusher proudly notes,
``we've put money away for the kids' college and Ed's coming
breakdown!''
</P>
<P>
   When Zone's own psychic collapse looms, however, the movie loses
its delicate balance. Cusack's performance becomes increasingly
frantic, less ``Say Anything'' cocky, way too ``Bullets Over
Broadway'' neurotic. And with the emphasis shifted to Zone's
crisis, the enjoyably inscrutable Bell is directed to the movie's
periphery. His tart-tongued tart Mary (Jolie) travels away with her
husband, leaving Zone and wife Connie (Blanchett) in an air pocket
of dreary recriminations and apologies.
</P>
<P>
   Half of a really good movie is certainly better than nothing.
But as steep descents will do, ``Pushing Tin's'' almost ruins a
good trip. &QL;

ADVERTISING: AGENCIES HOLD ANNUAL CONFERENCE IN UPBEAT MOOD 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By STUART ELLIOTT   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   The sunny skies over Madison Avenue, metaphorically speaking,
are likely to extend to northern Florida at the 81st annual meeting
of the American Association of Advertising Agencies.
</P>
<P>
   The meeting, which began Wednesday at the Ritz-Carlton hotel in
Amelia Island, brings together top executives of an industry that
is enjoying what is likely to be a sixth consecutive year of robust
growth. And for the largest agencies, whose executives are most
visible at such conferences _ from the meeting rooms to the golf
courses to the bars _ business has rarely been better.
</P>
<P>
   The optimistic mood is reflected in attendance for the event,
which continues through Saturday: executives from member agencies
are expected to turn out at the highest rate since 1990, the last
year before a wrenching recession took hold.
</P>
<P>
   When times are tough, members hunker down at home, passing up
stays at ritzy hotels. When their mood is ebullient, $255 a night
at a ``special conference rate,'' as described in the meeting
brochure, is not too costly an expense.
</P>
<P>
   Because this could well be ``a record year for the industry by
any measure,'' said O. Burtch Drake, president and chief executive
of the association, which is known as the Four A's, ``everybody's
going to this meeting in very high spirits.''
</P>
<P>
   As a result, he added in an interview before the meeting began,
he planned to devote his annual speech opening the general session
Thursday morning to ``12 things to celebrate.'' By comparison,
Drake's opening speech last year centered on concerns that he
thought needed to be addressed.
</P>
<P>
   Two issues that bothered association members in 1998 seem less
pressing. One was the encroachment of management consultants into
the realm of brand-building services offered by agencies.
</P>
<P>
   ``Last year, we seemed to be a little more up in arms about
being under attack from consultants,'' said Patrick McGrath, the
1998-99 chairman of the association who is president and chief
executive at Jordan McGrath Case &AMP; Partners/Euro RSCG in New York,
part of the Euro RSCG Worldwide unit of Havas Advertising.
</P>
<P>
   ``But now, rather than worrying,'' he added, ``the smart thing
seems to be to reassert what we do, how we do things that no
consultant can do.''
</P>
<P>
   McGrath said that he would describe one way to accomplish that
in a speech scheduled for this morning. He plans to outline the
efforts of a group formed at the 1998 meeting to produce ``The
Chairman's Initiative,'' a series of taped interviews with ``CEOs
of major corporations, talking about how important advertising
agencies have been to their brands and businesses.''
</P>
<P>
   McGrath said he would show segments of the initial tapes,
featuring John Pepper, chairman of Procter &AMP; Gamble Co., who is
speaking at the meeting, and Herbert Kelleher, chairman, president
and chief executive of Southwest Airlines Co.
</P>
<P>
   Four additional executives have agreed to be interviewed for the
series, McGrath said: Robert Eckert, president and chief executive
of the Kraft Foods unit of Philip Morris Cos.; Alan Hassenfeld,
chairman and chief executive of Hasbro Inc.; Edward Rust, chairman,
president and chief executive of State Farm Mutual Automobile
Insurance Co., and Stephen Sanger, chairman and chief executive of
General Mills Inc.
</P>
<P>
   The other issue that bothered members last year involved a
surprise move by the Association of National Advertisers, the trade
organization that represents marketers, to invite agencies to join.
That initiative was announced at the annual conference of the
advertiser association in October, with little or no consultation
with officials of the Four A's.
</P>
<P>
   ``That triggered a decision point for advertising agencies, to
affirm or deny whether we need an industry association,'' said
Shelly Lazarus, the 1998-99 chairwoman of the Four A's, who is
chairwoman and chief executive at Ogilvy &AMP; Mather Worldwide in New
York, part of WPP Group PLC.
</P>
<P>
   ``The answer was a resounding yes,'' said Ms. Lazarus, who
favors agency membership in the advertiser association, followed by
``a certain searching for a reaffirmation of what is valuable to
our members.''
</P>
<P>
   ``That makes some people nervous,'' she added, ``but I think
it's healthy.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Lazarus, who is to speak Saturday, said she intended to
discuss the need for agencies ``to know how to work their magic
through every point of contact, every way of reaching consumers, or
lose our appeal to clients.''
</P>
<P>
   Another topic on her agenda, she said, was the ``opportunity for
getting the talent we need for the future'' by taking advantage of
the ``fascination with the new media'' among young potential
employees.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we're viewed as being at the center of trying to figure out
a whole new world of communications, that would be extremely
compelling to them,'' Ms. Lazarus said. ``But if we're seen as `the
place to call if you want a television commercial,' we will not be
particularly interesting to future talent _ or to clients.''
</P>
<P>
   At a business session that opened the meeting _ formally known
as the 1999 management conference and annual meeting _ Ms. Lazarus
was elected chairwoman of the Four A's for 1999-2000.
</P>
<P>
   Also, Phil Dusenberry, chairman of BBDO New York, part of the
BBDO Worldwide unit of Omnicom Group, was elected vice chairman for
1999-2000. And John Emmerling, chairman and chief creative officer
at Emmerling Post in New York, was elected secretary and treasurer
for 1999-2000.
</P>
<P>
   While attendees may be beaming over the bright forecasts for the
industry, the actual weather is of some concern. That is because
Amelia Island was the site of a previous conference that became
synonymous with disastrous weather among the denizens of Madison
Avenue.
</P>
<P>
   In October 1996, the marketers' association held its annual
conference at the Ritz-Carlton during a rare Florida northeaster
that lasted throughout the entire event. Many attendees, forced
inside and deprived of their patio cocktails and sports
tournaments, developed cabin fever and fled. The pouring rain and
gale-force winds did not relent until the conference ended.
</P>
<P>
   ``Florida and I are not a good combination,'' Ms. Lazarus said
when reminded of the incident. ``Whenever I go, it really rains.''
</P>
<P>
   Drake called the 1996 conference ``the worst four days of my
life.''
</P>
<P>
   ``But I have my fingers crossed,'' he said. ``I figure the ANA
had all the bad luck and the Four A's is due for some good luck.''
</P>
<P>
   McGrath agreed.
</P>
<P>
   His weather forecast? ``Bring your shorts.''

COMMENTARY: ADDICTED TO VIOLENCE 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By BOB HERBERT   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Again.
</P>
<P>
   This time the massacre occurred at a high school in Littleton,
Colo., a normally quiet suburb of Denver. The killers drove a BMW
and were armed with handguns, semiautomatic weapons, a shotgun and
home-made explosive devices. Along with their weapons they carried
a collection of grievances, which they would seek to satisfy by
killing somebody.
</P>
<P>
   Welcome to America, a land where the killing is easy. We are so
familiar with this kind of story that news organizations across the
country moved effortlessly to cover it. In the middle of the
horror, some kids inside Columbine High School were on their cell
phones, updating reporters. They were petrified but they also
understood the drill. They'd seen it before.
</P>
<P>
   We've all seen it before. Few things are as familiar to
Americans as homicide. In fact or in fantasy _ en masse or one
killing at a time _ it is the stuff of both our history and our
everyday lives. It fascinates us, and many of us enjoy it, in one
form or another. The kids who opened fire on their schoolmates at
Columbine were said to have been giggling as they killed. A junior
named Crystal Woodman said in a television interview: ``Every time
they'd shoot someone they'd holler, like it was, like, exciting.''
</P>
<P>
   We make it exciting. We celebrate it, romanticize it, eroticize
it, and mass-market the weapons that bring murder within easy reach
of one and all. It's no big deal. Just pick up that handgun and
drive down to the video store for a couple of exciting flicks about
killing women. And if somebody cuts your car off along the way,
shoot him.
</P>
<P>
   Handgun Control, a lobbying organization in Washington, offers
the following astonishing fact: ``In 1996, handguns were used to
murder two people in New Zealand, 15 in Japan, 30 in Great Britain,
106 in Canada, 213 in Germany and 9,390 in the United States.''
</P>
<P>
   We have a problem.
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton said Tuesday: ``We must do more to reach out
to our children and teach them to express their anger and resolve
their conflicts with words, not weapons.''
</P>
<P>
   But that's not easy in a country that has always been proud of
its willingness to use force _ sometimes legitimately, sometimes
illegitimately _ to get its way. One of the earliest lessons of
childhood in America is that it is normal, at least in some
circumstances, to reach for a gun. And that insidious credo is
relentlessly reinforced by the firearms manufacturers and their
lackeys who seem at times to want to put a gun in the hands of
every man, woman and child in the nation. At last count there were
192 million firearms in the hands of private citizens in the U.S.
</P>
<P>
   If the kids in America could be induced to look up from the
violence of their video games or away from the violence on TV, and
gaze back over the history of violence in this country, they would
be occupied for a long, long time. They would see the armed misfits
and the lone gunmen and the street gangs and the drug gangs and the
serial killers and the madness of the militias and assorted mad
bombers and the celebrated outrages of organized crime and the
terrifying uprisings in the cities and the outlaw heroes like
Bonnie and Clyde and Billy the Kid and the lynchings of blacks,
Jews and Catholics in the South and elsewhere and the massacre of
the Indians and the enslavement of the Africans and so forth.
</P>
<P>
   Columbine High is in the news, but our problem is far greater
than the slaughter of the innocents in the schools. We are addicted
to violence. It sustains and entertains us. And every now and then
when it erupts in a place where we think it shouldn't _ a suburban
high school in a nice quiet neighborhood _ we throw up our hands
and wonder what went wrong.
</P>
<P>
   ``How can it happen here?'' we ask.
</P>
<P>
   We'll move on from this, just as we did after the riots and the
assassinations of the 1960s, and the soaring crime rates of the
'70s and '80s, and the massacre on the Long Island Rail Road and
the bombing of the federal building in Oklahoma City in the 1990s.
We'll move on until the next time, when another dozen or so kids
are killed, or something worse happens. Then we'll throw up our
hands again and ask what went wrong.
</P>
<P>
   It's like that with an addiction. Nothing happens until you
admit you have a problem.

US TO WELCOME 20,000 KOSOVAR REFUGEES 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By BOB HOHLER AND SUSAN MILLIGAN  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The Clinton administration opened the door
Wednesday for as many as 20,000 Kosovar refugees to seek shelter in
the United States, dumping an earlier plan to confine the displaced
victims of Serb aggression at a US naval base in Guantanamo, Cuba.
</P>
<P>
   The refugees, a fraction of the 600,000 who have been driven
from their homes in Kosovo, will be moved from temporary shelters
in neighboring Balkan countries and matched with relatives or
sponsors throughout the United States.
</P>
<P>
   The new policy, announced by Vice President Al Gore at Ellis
Island, was developed after concerns were raised that images of the
United States confining the refugees to a military base in Cuba
would create a propaganda boon for Yugoslav President Slobodan
Milosevic. Human rights advocates also criticized the prisonlike
conditions the refugees would endure at Guantanamo.
</P>
<P>
   ``We will accept, on the American mainland, up to 20,000 of the
hurting and homeless Kosovar refugees, those with close family ties
in America, and those who are particularly vulnerable,'' Gore said
in a speech marking the 50th anniversary of the NATO alliance.
</P>
<P>
   On the 29th day of NATO air strikes, there was increasing
discussion among NATO allies about the possibility of deploying
ground troops against the Serb forces. The prospect of a ground war
is expected to be a major topic when NATO's anniversary summit
starts Friday in Washington.
</P>
<P>
   But US officials said they continue to oppose the initiative, as
do leaders of several other NATO nations. And Defense Secretary
William S. Cohen warned against raising expectations of NATO troops
invading Kosovo. ``If we were to threaten ground forces and not
have the consensus for it,'' Cohen told a House Appropriations
panel, ``it would be an empty threat.''
</P>
<P>
   There were these other developments Wednesday as the Balkans
remained mired in conflict:
</P>
<P>
   --Evidence mounted that Milosevic's forces are expanding their
``clean-and-sweep'' operation against ethnic Albanians beyond
Kosovo to Yugoslavia's sister republic of Montenegro. The Serb push
into Montenegro, increasing the danger of the conflict spreading,
raised red flags among NATO members. Secretary of State Madeleine
K. Albright told the House International Relations Committee that
the United States and NATO have warned Milosevic ``that incursions
into Montenegro would have serious consequences.''
</P>
<P>
   --NATO expanded the focus of allied air strikes from military
targets to centers of Milosevic's political power. In Belgrade,
missiles hammered the national headquarters of Milosevic's
Socialist Party of Serbia. Transmitters for television and radio
stations owned by Milosevic's daughter also were hit, as were other
businesses and political offices run by allies of Milosevic. ``We
are now striking at the very heart of his bloodstained regime,''
British Defense Secretary George Robertson said at a briefing in
London.
</P>
<P>
   --Milosevic and his associates expressed continued defiance of
the NATO forces. But in an interview to be broadcast Thursday night
by a Houston television station, Milosevic said the three American
soldiers who have spent three weeks as prisoners of war in
Yugoslavia are not in danger.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are a very old people with a long tradition of respecting
POWs,'' Milosevic said, according to a news release from KHOU-TV in
Houston. ``Nothing will happen to them. They are being treated
well. They are healthy. The Geneva Convention will be respected.''
</P>
<P>
   --Clinton's approval rating dropped to 56 percent, its lowest in
nearly two years, as a result of the attack on Yugoslavia,
according to a poll conducted by the Pew Research Center. Although
Clinton's favorability rating remains relatively high, the figure
never dropped below 59 percent during the Monica S. Lewinsky
scandal, including the impeachment process.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, the United States prepared to expand its involvement
in the conflict by dispatching low-flying Apache helicopters to
strike Serb ground troops and armored units. Twelve Apaches arrived
Wednesday in Tirana, Albania, after a lengthy delay caused by
stormy weather. Twelve more of the attack helicopters are on the
way.
</P>
<P>
   The Pentagon, running short on cruise missiles, Wednesday
awarded Boeing Co. a $41.3 million contract to convert 95 nuclear
versions of the air-launched missiles to carry conventional
warheads. The American stockpile of cruise missiles has dropped
below 100 after scores have been fired on Yugoslav targets.
</P>
<P>
   At Ellis Island, Gore used the symbolic backdrop of the historic
immigration center to say the 20,000 Kosovar refugees will remain
in the United States ``until they are able to return home safely.''
The refugees are expected to enter the country through air bases on
the East Coast.
</P>
<P>
   By relocating the displaced ethnic Albanians to the US mainland,
however, the Clinton administration will give the refugees the
opportunity to apply for political asylum in the United States,
which they could not have done at the naval base on the Cuban
island.
</P>
<P>
   International relief agencies expressed growing concern about
the potential exodus of an additional 850,000 ethnic Albanians from
Kosovo as Serb troops continue their campaign of alleged genocide
and ``ethnic cleansing'' in the separatist Yugoslav province.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's the biggest worry we have,'' said J. Brian Atwood,
director of the US Agency for International Development, the
nation's top relief agency, after touring a refugee center
Wednesday in Tirana.
</P>
<P>
   Atwood said Albania, which has taken in more than 370,000
refugees, lacks the infrastructure to help any more, despite its
willingness.
</P>
<P>
   Macedonia, which is providing temporary shelter to more than
135,000 refugees, is ``at a breaking point,'' Atwood said.
</P>
<P>
   In Washington, Hillary Rodham Clinton appealed for private
contributions to help ease the crisis. ``We cannot let this
conflict derail the social, economic and political progress that
Macedonia and its neighbors have struggled so hard and for so long
to achieve,'' she said in a speech to humanitarian relief groups.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, tensions remained high in neighboring Montenegro,
where Yugoslav Army forces directed by Milosevic have targeted some
of the 75,000 refugees from Kosovo. The Yugoslav troops are vying
with the state police, who are loyal to the anti-Milosevic
government of Montenegro, for control of the republic, although the
conflict has yet to explode into open, armed confrontation.
</P>
<P>
   Still, there is widespread fear that the crisis could erupt into
a civil war or military coup. Tensions are highest at key border
crossings between Montenegro and Croatia. ``These are sensitive and
potentially dangerous places,'' said Luigj Juncaj, the Montenegrin
minister for minority rights.

BOSTON TV STATIONS AGREE TO CURTAIL HOSTAGE COVERAGE 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (a and e coding)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DON AUCOIN  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON -- In an unusual move aimed at limiting the risk during
hostage situations, Boston TV stations have quietly negotiated an
agreement with Boston and State Police that will restrict live
coverage when hostages or armed suspects are involved.
</P>
<P>
   Under a draft of the arrangement obtained by The Boston Globe,
the TV stations agree that they will not ``air either critical
ground or aerial videotape until after the incident has been
resolved.'' According to Margot Hill, spokeswoman for the Boston
Police Department, that means refraining from live broadcasts of
footage that could jeopardize a rescue attempt by revealing police
movements or hostages' whereabouts.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, the agreement will restrict Boston's six news
stations to a single pool camera on the ground and a single
helicopter camera during what police call ``critical incidents.''
The guidelines were drafted before the shootings at a Colorado
school Tuesday again spotlighted how tricky the media's role can be
during a crisis.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, the Boston stations agreed not to attempt to contact
suspects ``without the guidance of the chief hostage negotiator''
or to otherwise ``interfere with the negotiation process'' during
hostage situations.
</P>
<P>
   In return, the TV stations will be granted a location ``within
the inner perimeter'' of the action for the pool camera, and will
receive ``lots of access, lots of informational updates'' from
police, according to Hill. Police will also hold informational
meetings with employees of each news station to explain how they
operate in the field during crisis situations.
</P>
<P>
   The draft of the agreement also contains a clause that will
expand access for newspaper photographers. It states that a pool
photographer for the print media ``shall also be given an
advantageous shot.'' Currently, police can keep photographers
behind designated lines during crisis situations.
</P>
<P>
   Peter Southwick, director of photography for the Globe, said
``the intention of the agreement is positive. Under ideal
conditions it will give news organizations, including our own, more
ability to cover these situations.'' He added: ``The greater issue
is that we don't want in any way to interfere with public safety
doing their jobs or endanger anyone's life.''
</P>
<P>
   That sentiment was echoed Wednesday by news directors at Boston
TV stations. They said they accept the agreement and itscurbs on
live coverage _ which will only apply when hostages are being held
or armed suspects have barricaded themselves _ because they believe
the restrictions will mean less danger for hostages and bystanders.
</P>
<P>
   ``I see them as guidelines for safety,'' said Peter Brown, news
director at WBZ-Ch. 4. ``My issue is that no story is more
important than someone's life.'' Agreed Mark Berryhill, news
director at WHDH-Ch.7: ``It makes a lot of sense, with times
changing. There have been some situations that have arisen that we
want to prevent in Boston.''
</P>
<P>
   But some questioned the arrangement. Bob Steele, director of the
ethics program at the Poynter Institute for Media Studies in
Florida, said that while broadcast journalists need ``meaningful
guidelines'' for their coverage of crises, the ``danger'' of the
Boston accord is that ``journalists also have a responsibility to
cover law enforcement as an independent watchdog.''
</P>
<P>
   The new agreement is the outgrowth of a meeting between
officials of the Boston, Brookline and State Police, TV news
directors, and newspaper photography supervisors. Media executives
emphasized that the agreement is voluntary and that they are not
required to sign it.
</P>
<P>
   But the fact that the TV stations will agree to the curbs
underscores the degree to which, in an era of live saturation
coverage, they want to avoid the pitfalls that abound for
broadcasters every time a school explodes in violence or hostages
are seized.
</P>
<P>
   ``These are made-for-television dramas,'' said Robert Lichter,
director of the Washington-based Center on Media and Public
Affairs. ``The problem is that reporters tend to become actors in
these dramas.''
</P>
<P>
   That happened again during the Columbine High School shootings
on Tuesday. Denver TV stations drew criticism Wednesday for
televising SWAT team movements and the escape routes of terrified
students, and for broadcasting interviews of students trapped
inside the school. ``There are some lessons that can be learned
from looking at (Tuesday),'' said Candy Altman, news director at
WCVB-Ch. 5. ``We all need to take a deep breath in this business
and think about the impact of everything we put on the air.''
</P>
<P>
   Last February, before Berryhill arrived at Channel 7, the
station ignited controversy during a Salem hostage situation by
reporting that the suspect was in the home of a prison guard _ a
fact police did not want publicized. Last May a radio station and
newspaper in Florida drew criticism for calling a gunman holed up
in a gas station with a hostage and interviewing him.

 &HT;    Colorado man's name same as school shooting suspects
 &HT;    By George Orbanek
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Tuesday, April 20, dawned like any other morning for the Larry
Klebold family of Broomfield, Colo. For Larry and wife Karen, it
was another day tending to the family business, the Klebold
Consulting Group, a construction financial consulting business. For
sons Cory and Mason, another school day awaited in the Broomfield
Public School system, roughly mid-way between Boulder and the
suburbs of north Denver.
</P>
<P>
   By day's end, the family?s life had been knocked askew, the
result of being caught in the intersection between the tragic
events which occurred at Littleton?s Columbine High School and the
rush of the national and international press to cover the bloodiest
act of school violence in U.S. history.
</P>
<P>
   Sheriff's authorities identified the two suspected gunmen as
Eric Harris and Dylan Klebold, both of whom were said to have
committed suicide after leaving 13 students and teachers dead in
Tuesday's shooting rampage.
</P>
<P>
   The Dylan Klebold of Littleton's Columbine High School is not
related to the Larry Klebold family of Broomfield.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've since learned that I'm apparently the only Klebold listed
in the Colorado telephone directory,'' Larry Klebold told areporter
Wednesday afternoon. ``My telephone hasn't stopped ringing since
this whole thing started.''
</P>
<P>
   As a result, Broomfield's Klebold family has since been given a
personal insight into the workings of the modern media hive.
</P>
<P>
   Klebold said he was telephoned by The New York Times twice. He
ticked off a lengthy laundry lists of other media interests
demanding to know if he was the father of one of the two suspected
gunmen. They included, among others, the New York Daily News, Fox
News Network, all of the Denver television stations and most of the
city's printed press, ``Dateline NBC,'' ``Inside Edition,''
reporters from Melbourne, Australia, and Toronto, Canada.
</P>
<P>
   ``The best one was the guy from ?Larry King Live,? `` said
Klebold. He said that the representative from King?s evening cable
talk show expressed all manner of sympathy for the family's
presumed anguish over the loss of a son and quickly added, ``We're
going to be in Denver
</P>
<P>
   tomorrow and if I were you I really wouldn?t do interviews with
anyone else.''
</P>
<P>
   The family also has had to cope with a number of harassing phone
calls. Klebold said, ``I got a call at 3 o'clock in the morning
from someone who says, `Are you the guy who raised this bastard' ``
</P>
<P>
   Until Tuesday afternoon, the Larry Klebold family of Broomfield
did not know that a Dylan
</P>
<P>
   Klebold, alleged mass murderer, even existed. ``I want out of
the loop,'' Larry Klebold said.
</P>

Grand Junction, Colo.

<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The Clinton's administration decision Wednesday to
allow 20,000 Kosovar refugees to settle temporarily in the United
States, a political about-face from a prior plan to put them at
Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, could bring a significant number of the
ethnic Albanians to Massachusetts.
</P>
<P>
   At least 15,000 Albanian-Americans, and possibly many more, live
in the Bay State, according to Anthony Athanas, the founder of
Anthony's Pier Four restaurant, who was born in Albania and came to
the United States when he was six years old.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm ready to do anything,'' said Athanas, who spoke with
President Clinton about the Kosovo situation when Clinton visited
Massachusetts last week.
</P>
<P>
   The decision also demonstrates that the administration believes
the war in the Balkans is going to last longer than originally
anticipated, analysts said. The new policy of bringing the refugees
to homes throughout the United States probably means that the
Kosovars' hope of returning to their homeland is, at best, many
months away.
</P>
<P>
   A State Department official said that under the family
reunification program, ethnic Albanians in camps in Macedonia who
want to relocate to the United States will be interviewed,
connected with American relatives, undergo a medical screening, and
be processed as refugees, or persons who have been persecuted in
their homeland.
</P>
<P>
   With refugee status, they will be eligible for a host of
social-welfare benefits, including food stamps, and entitled to
apply for permanent residency in the United States after one year.
</P>
<P>
   The 20,000 refugees will include some who don't have American
relatives but are deemed ``in vulnerable circumstances'' by State
Department and immigration officials, said Maria Cardona, a
spokeswoman for the Immigration and Naturalization Service.
</P>
<P>
   The refugees who volunteer will come only from camps in
Macedonia, a State Department official said, ``because we want to
relieve the strain there first.''
</P>
<P>
   The administration initially opposed having the refugees come to
the US mainland, saying that might give the impression Washington
was legitimizing the ``ethnic cleansing'' policy of Yugoslav
President Slobodan Milosevic.
</P>
<P>
   But the idea of housing the refugees at Guantanamo prompted
harsh criticism from human rights advocates who said the Kosovars
should be allowed to come to the US mainland rather than a
prison-like facility on a naval base.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a welcome change in policy,'' said Sherle
Schwenninger, a senior fellow at the World Policy Institute. He had
criticized the original plan of using Guantanamo, saying images of
refugees behind barbed wire would be a public relations disaster.
</P>
<P>
   ``The one thing the US is good at is opening itself up to
displaced people and refugees and immigrants,'' Schwenninger said.
</P>
<P>
   Families interested in hosting refugees will be able to call a
toll-free number that should be set up Thursday, the State
Department official said.
</P>
<P>
   US officials said they were not sure where the bulk of the
relocations would be, and they expected it would take several weeks
to get the refugee airlift under way.
</P>
<P>
   Senator Edward M. Kennedy, who has advocated bringing the
refugees to the United States, said: ``This action is certainly far
better than housing them in Guantanamo. It is important for
Americans to be at the forefront of the international effort to
meet the needs of the refugees and ease their suffering.''
</P>
<P>
   Azem Tachi of Worcester, Mass., a leader of the
Albanian-American community there, said he believes as many as 300
to 500 refugees could find temporary homes there and applauded the
decision by Clinton to allow them to come to the United States.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is good because these people might be able to work right
away and not be stuck in camps, and children can go to school. They
get back to life. It will be a big change for them. If things
straighten out in Kosovo, people will be elated to go back if they
want,'' he said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Tachi said there are about 2,600 residents of Albanian heritage
in the Worcester area and many are willing to help. A group there,
the New England Albanian Relief Organization (NEARO), has been
shipping food and clothing to Kosovo for years, he said, but even
more in recent weeks.

SAGA OF `ELIZABETH'   CLOAKED IN INTRIGUE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By ROB LOWMAN  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ If a film set in Elizabethan times had to win the
Academy Award for best picture, it should have been the one about
the monarch who put her stamp on the era. And if an actress should
have gotten an Oscar for playing Queen Elizabeth I (1533-1603), it
should have been Cate Blanchett for best actress rather than Judi
Dench as best supporting.
</P>
<P>
   That's no disrespect to Dame Judi, who is in the pantheon of
actresses, but her brief time on the screen pales next to
Blanchett's metamorphosis from a sensuous but awkward girl to the
self-assured Virgin Queen in ``Elizabeth,'' which comes out on
video next week. And no disrespect to ``Shakespeare in Love,''
which is a frothy and delightful mixture of fact and fancy that
offers a lighthearted conjecture on how a struggling playwright
became, well, the Bard. But ``Elizabeth,'' even with its flaws, is
a darker and more interesting vision.
</P>
<P>
   If some viewers shied away from ``Elizabeth,'' which was
directed by Shekhar Kapur (``Bandit Queen''), because it was a
historical costume drama, then they were missing out on what is
ultimately a tale of high-stakes political intrigue with a
``Godfather''-like ending.
</P>
<P>
   But if the history is confusing, here's a thumbnail sketch: In
1554, Henry VIII is dead, and England is racked by religious
instability. A dying and childless Mary I, a Catholic known as
``Bloody Mary,'' rules, and has stepped up her suppression of
Protestants. Despite attempts to get rid of her, Mary's
half-sister, Elizabeth, ascends to the throne upon the queen's
death in 1558. She continues to be seen as a threat by Catholics,
who plot to oust her. (In those days, that didn't mean getting a
talk show but more likely losing your head.) Meanwhile, her
advisers press her to marry a foreign ruler in order to stabilize
the country.
</P>
<P>
   This is where the film takes off. Elizabeth is conflicted
between her own urges _ an affair with Lord Robert Dudley (Joseph
Fiennes, who also played Shakespeare in love) and the affairs of
state. Aided by a master spy, Sir Francis Walsingham (Oscar winner
Geoffrey Rush, who received an Oscar nomination for
``Shakespeare''), Elizabeth realizes that her only chance of
survival is to assert herself and not subjugate herself to any man.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike many Hollywood films, ``Elizabeth'' is fairly accurate
historically. Dudley and Walsingham were real enough and played
important roles in Elizabeth's life. How the machinations in the
royal court unfold is a matter for conjecture and for historians
(and Hollywood) to fill in. Kapur's direction, while flamboyant at
times, stays focused enough to keep the film on the right track.
</P>
<P>
   While ``Elizabeth'' doesn't really penetrate the veil of
history, which Kapur seems to use as a metaphor, judging by the
number of shots filtered through soft focus, smoke or curtains, it
does put forth an interesting theory on origination of the Virgin
Queen.
</P>
<P>
   The people need something to believe in, Walsingham tells
Elizabeth as she gazes up at a statue of the Virgin Mary. What
ensued created an empire (but that's another film).
</P>
<P>
   SEEING STARS: As they did for their 100 greatest movies list,
the American Film Institute in conjunction with the major Hollywood
studios will release 100 videos for AFI's ``100 Years ... 100
Stars.'' The names of the top 25 men and 25 women stars will be
revealed on a three-hour CBS special on June 15. Each of the past
stars will be introduced by a contemporary star. The 100 videos,
which will have stickers that say ``Legendary Performance'' or
``Star Performance,'' are of the 50 old stars and 50 new stars.
They will be available in stores June 16. More information about
the event and who was nominated can be found on the Web at
afionline.org.
</P>
<P>
   WHAT'S IN STORE: Blockbuster has begun to release its own line
of videos. So far, the titles are of some of the more interesting
movies from the premium cable channels and smaller independent
films. Among the first releases from the cables are `The Baby
Dance,'' a drama produced by Jodie Foster and starring Laura Dern
and Stockard Channing, and ``Safe House,'' a thriller with ``Star
Trek's'' Patrick Stewart. ``The Curve'' is a thriller that played
at Sundance. It stars ``Felicity's'' Keri Russell and has a
soundtrack featuring Sarah McLachan and the Smiths. The video
chain's Web site is blockbuster.com. &QL;

BOSTON TV STATIONS AGREE TO CURTAIL HOSTAGE COVERAGE 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (a and e coding)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DON AUCOIN  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON -- In an unusual move aimed at limiting the risk during
hostage situations, Boston TV stations have quietly negotiated an
agreement with Boston and State Police that will restrict live
coverage when hostages or armed suspects are involved.
</P>
<P>
   Under a draft of the arrangement obtained by The Boston Globe,
the TV stations agree that they will not ``air either critical
ground or aerial videotape until after the incident has been
resolved.'' According to Margot Hill, spokeswoman for the Boston
Police Department, that means refraining from live broadcasts of
footage that could jeopardize a rescue attempt by revealing police
movements or hostages' whereabouts.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, the agreement will restrict Boston's six news
stations to a single pool camera on the ground and a single
helicopter camera during what police call ``critical incidents.''
The guidelines were drafted before the shootings at a Colorado
school Tuesday again spotlighted how tricky the media's role can be
during a crisis.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, the Boston stations agreed not to attempt to contact
suspects ``without the guidance of the chief hostage negotiator''
or to otherwise ``interfere with the negotiation process'' during
hostage situations.
</P>
<P>
   In return, the TV stations will be granted a location ``within
the inner perimeter'' of the action for the pool camera, and will
receive ``lots of access, lots of informational updates'' from
police, according to Hill. Police will also hold informational
meetings with employees of each news station to explain how they
operate in the field during crisis situations.
</P>
<P>
   The draft of the agreement also contains a clause that will
expand access for newspaper photographers. It states that a pool
photographer for the print media ``shall also be given an
advantageous shot.'' Currently, police can keep photographers
behind designated lines during crisis situations.
</P>
<P>
   Peter Southwick, director of photography for the Globe, said
``the intention of the agreement is positive. Under ideal
conditions it will give news organizations, including our own, more
ability to cover these situations.'' He added: ``The greater issue
is that we don't want in any way to interfere with public safety
doing their jobs or endanger anyone's life.''
</P>
<P>
   That sentiment was echoed Wednesday by news directors at Boston
TV stations. They said they accept the agreement and itscurbs on
live coverage _ which will only apply when hostages are being held
or armed suspects have barricaded themselves _ because they believe
the restrictions will mean less danger for hostages and bystanders.
</P>
<P>
   ``I see them as guidelines for safety,'' said Peter Brown, news
director at WBZ-Ch. 4. ``My issue is that no story is more
important than someone's life.'' Agreed Mark Berryhill, news
director at WHDH-Ch.7: ``It makes a lot of sense, with times
changing. There have been some situations that have arisen that we
want to prevent in Boston.''
</P>
<P>
   But some questioned the arrangement. Bob Steele, director of the
ethics program at the Poynter Institute for Media Studies in
Florida, said that while broadcast journalists need ``meaningful
guidelines'' for their coverage of crises, the ``danger'' of the
Boston accord is that ``journalists also have a responsibility to
cover law enforcement as an independent watchdog.''
</P>
<P>
   The new agreement is the outgrowth of a meeting between
officials of the Boston, Brookline and State Police, TV news
directors, and newspaper photography supervisors. Media executives
emphasized that the agreement is voluntary and that they are not
required to sign it.
</P>
<P>
   But the fact that the TV stations will agree to the curbs
underscores the degree to which, in an era of live saturation
coverage, they want to avoid the pitfalls that abound for
broadcasters every time a school explodes in violence or hostages
are seized.
</P>
<P>
   ``These are made-for-television dramas,'' said Robert Lichter,
director of the Washington-based Center on Media and Public
Affairs. ``The problem is that reporters tend to become actors in
these dramas.''
</P>
<P>
   That happened again during the Columbine High School shootings
on Tuesday. Denver TV stations drew criticism Wednesday for
televising SWAT team movements and the escape routes of terrified
students, and for broadcasting interviews of students trapped
inside the school. ``There are some lessons that can be learned
from looking at (Tuesday),'' said Candy Altman, news director at
WCVB-Ch. 5. ``We all need to take a deep breath in this business
and think about the impact of everything we put on the air.''
</P>
<P>
   Last February, before Berryhill arrived at Channel 7, the
station ignited controversy during a Salem hostage situation by
reporting that the suspect was in the home of a prison guard _ a
fact police did not want publicized. Last May a radio station and
newspaper in Florida drew criticism for calling a gunman holed up
in a gas station with a hostage and interviewing him.

   LITTLETON, Colo. _ The two Columbine High School seniors worked
last Friday making pizzas. On Monday, they went bowling. And on
Tuesday they committed mass murder.
</P>
<P>
   Nobody had taken Eric Harris and Dylan Klebold seriously.
</P>
<P>
   They wore long black coats and hung with a clique of
middle-class suburban teen-agers that called itself the Trenchcoat
Mafia. They struck sullen, brooding poses. They spouted racist
views. They talked about Hitler and wore clothes with a swastikas.
</P>
<P>
   The other students say they wanted to portray themselves as
rebels or villains. But mostly they were viewed as losers.
</P>
<P>
   ``They were just a little weird,'' said Dara Ferguson, a
17-year-old junior and a cheerleader. ``They wanted to be
different.''
</P>
<P>
   The two youths, who killed themselves after the rampage, had
shouted almost gleefully about students being mean to them, as they
pumped bullets into their schoolmates, according to some of the
survivors.
</P>
<P>
   ``We thought they were bitter and, you know, upset with life,''
said Lindsey Jackson, a 17-year-old junior who is a member of the
Student Senate. ``But we never imagined that they were so filled
with hate.''
</P>
<P>
   Classmates described Klebold as tall and skinny, a bit gangly,
with shaggy blond hair. Harris was much shorter and dark-haired.
Both favored the all-black attire known as ``goth,'' the fashion of
the mock-gothic musical subculture known for a fascination with
death.
</P>
<P>
   The suspected gunmen were said to play an Internet game called
Doom, where players use pipe bombs and shotguns to demolish
opponents. During lunchtime, they sometimes played a card game
called Nuclear War.
</P>
<P>
   Some students said Harris, who was known as something of a
computer whiz with his own Web site, had produced a video that
bragged about his gun collection.
</P>
<P>
   A photograph of Klebold in the 1998 yearbook is accompanied by
the statement: ``After going through many experiences in their
lives, oftentimes students have regrets of past actions.''
</P>
<P>
   Columbine is regarded as a top-notch school, one of the draws to
Littleton, a charming suburb with an ample supply of large houses
with windows that look out on the foothills of the Rocky Mountains.
A sheriff's deputy is posted at the school, but students say the
officer's duties have mostly centered on catching students who park
their cars in faculty spaces.
</P>
<P>
   Harris lived in a two-story house in the St. Columbine Knolls
subdivision. Klebold lived in a handsome, contemporary house near
Deer Creek, where bear and deer chase through the fields.
</P>
<P>
   Athletic prowess was often the way to popularity at Columbine,
as at many schools, and students here say Harris and Klebold, who
did not play sports, detested athletes.
</P>
<P>
   ``The athletes get a lot of attention at school,'' said Kristin
Couris, a 17-year-old junior and lacrosse player, who said the
school's closed-circuit television often carried accounts of
heroics on the athletic fields. ``They didn't like that.''
</P>
<P>
   Jeff Matthews, a 16-year-old junior, said Klebold and Harris had
turned to the trenchcoat group because they did not fit in with any
of their other peers. ``I guess when you have a lack of friends,
you feel unwanted,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Sara Schweitzberger, 15, had a gym class with Klebold, and said
it was obvious he felt socially ostracized. ``He really felt
unloved,'' Schweitzberger said. ``He wasn't so bad. He was lonely.
I just wish I could give him a hug and tell him that I care.''
</P>
<P>
   The trenchcoat group, which numbered from 10 to 30 students in a
school of about 1,800, usually kept its distance from the other
students, often gathering under the steps during lunchtime, while
everyone else ate at cafeteria tables.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a pretty preppie, conservative school,'' said Miss
Jackson. ``Kids wear Ambercrombie, Tommy Hilfiger, American
Eagle.''

 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By CARLTON THOMPSON  
 c. 1999, Houston Chronicle  
CHICAGO _ If Wrigley Field ever decides to succumb to the trend of
selling naming rights, the Astros might suggest Jiffy Lube or
Tune-Up Masters.
<TEXT>
<P>
   After all, nothing gets the Astros' motor going faster than a
trip to the Friendly Confines.
</P>
<P>
   To say the Astros' offense is clicking on all cylinders might be
an understatement. The crack mechanics known as the Chicago Cubs'
pitching staff may as well have installed rocket boosters on the
Astros' bats, which revved up to the tune of 13 hits in a 10-3
blowout Wednesday afternoon.
</P>
<P>
   Jeff Bagwell was the driving force behind Wednesday's effort,
belting three home runs and overtaking Jimmy Wynn as the Astros'
all-time long-ball king. In typical Bagwell fashion, he tried to
downplay his accomplishments, choosing instead to focus on the
team's success.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was just up there swinging and trying to hit the ball
hard,'' said Bagwell, whose 225 career homers are two more than
Wynn had as an Astro. ``I was just trying to do something to help
the ballclub. It was a good win for our team; it's nice to see our
offense starting to come together.''
</P>
<P>
   That tends to happen here.
</P>
<P>
   The Astros have won five consecutive games at Wrigley Field,
outscoring the Cubs by a combined 53-17. Bagwell, who hit three
homers in a game for the second time (he did it against the Dodgers
in 1994), also matched his career high with six RBIs and extended
his hitting streak to 10 games _ the longest for an Astro this
season.
</P>
<P>
   ``My whole thing is driving in runs,'' he said. ``That's why I
liked the second one the best.''
</P>
<P>
   In the sixth three-homer game in Astros history, Bagwell hit a
solo blast in the first, a three-run shot in the third and a
two-run bomb in the seventh. He struck out in the fifth and
grounded out to third in the ninth, missing a chance to tie the
major-league record of four homers in a game.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were getting on Baggy after he didn't get a homer in that
last at-bat,'' shortstop Ricky Gutierrez cracked. ``He had a heck
of a day.''
</P>
<P>
   But this was hardly a one-man effort. Every Astro who had an
at-bat _ with the exception of pitcher Shane Reynolds and pinch
hitter Alex Diaz _ got at least one hit, with Gutierrez and Carl
Everett collecting two apiece.
</P>
<P>
   That was more than enough offense for Reynolds, who scattered
eight hits over seven innings and held the Cubs to two runs _ quite
an accomplishment considering the trouble he dodged over the first
three innings.
</P>
<P>
   The Astros, who lead the National League with a .306 team
batting average, have totaled 45 hits and 28 runs over their last
three games. Needless to say, concerns about their once-struggling
offense have disappeared.
</P>
<P>
   ``We knew it was just a matter of time before we started putting
up some runs,'' said Everett, who has hit in 13 of the Astros' 14
games. ``The only thing that has been missing is the key hit _
getting guys in from second and third. Now, we've started to do a
better job of that.''
</P>
<P>
   Bagwell's three-run homer in the third came with two out. The
long blast ended up on Waveland Avenue and gave the Astros a 4-0
lead.
</P>
<P>
   The Cubs had runners in scoring position in each of the first
three innings against Reynolds, but they weren't able to break
through until the third. Lance Johnson and Mickey Morandini led off
the inning with doubles, the second of which scored Johnson.
</P>
<P>
   A botched rundown play and a walk put Reynolds in a bases-loaded
jam with nobody out. But unlike in his previous outing _ he allowed
the Cardinals to score five runs in the fourth inning _ Reynolds
minimized the damage, allowing just one more run on a sacrifice fly
by Glenallen Hill.
</P>
<P>
   ``You have to stay away from the big inning,'' Reynolds said.
``We saw that in my last start. They had a chance to score a lot of
runs in the third inning, but I made some good pitches and got out
of it.''
</P>
<P>
   Reynolds (3-1) retired 14 of the next 18 batters he faced after
walking Mark Grace in the third, effectively shutting down the
Cubs' offense until the torrid Hill (.484, five homers, 14 RBIs)
greeted reliever Doug Henry with a leadoff home run in the eighth.
</P>
<P>
   After hitting a pair of homers off Cubs starter Scott Sanders
(0-2), Bagwell decided to pick on reliever Rodney Myers. His
two-run homer off Myers highlighted the Astros' three-run seventh.
Derek Bell had an RBI single in the inning.
</P>
<P>
   The Astros scored three more runs in the eighth inning, two on
Craig Biggio's fifth double of the season and the other on an RBI
single by Tony Eusebio. By that time, Bagwell already had made sure
there would be no comeback for the Cubs.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was the man today,'' Astros third baseman Ken Caminiti
said. ``Three home runs in a game _ that's called earning your
money. He can hit, man. He's just one of those guys who can hit in
his sleep.''
</P>
<P>
   And Bagwell had plenty to sleep on after Wednesday's heroics.

 Rivalry Comes to Online Addresses
<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR;  &QL;  &LR; 
 &UR; By Jon Swartz &LR;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; c 1999, San Francisco Chronicle &QL;  &LR; 
 &QL; 
Internet domain names _ the cyber equivalent of real estate _ got
its first wave of new brokers yesterday.
</P>
<P>
   America Online and France Telecom were among five high-tech
companies selected to compete with Network Solutions, the U.S.
government-sanctioned company in charge of assigning such popular
Web addresses as .com, .net and .org.
</P>
<P>
   A second group of 29 companies led by AT&AMP;T Corp. is expected to
follow them and dole out popular Web addresses as early as this
summer.
</P>
<P>
   The long-anticipated move is designed to give consumers and
businesses the benefits of a competitive market for online
addresses as part of the government's hands-off Net policy. They
will have more firms to choose from and mostly likely pay less for
their services.
</P>
<P>
   The decision also provides a much needed cash infusion for NSI,
which will gain revenues from rivals who will pay fees to access
NSI's computer systems and list addresses on its database.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, AOL is expected to hawk personalized Web
addresses to its 17 million subscribers as a digital vanity license
plate.
</P>
<P>
   Yesterday's announcement is the initial phase in a ``major
milestone in the joint efforts of the public and private sectors to
bring Internet users the benefits of real competition in
registration services,'' said Esther Dyson, interim chairman of the
nonprofit Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers
(ICANN).
</P>
<P>
   The companies chosen to compete with NSI by ICANN, a group in
charge of privatizing the Internet, include Australia's Melbourne
IT, Register.com and the nonprofit Internet Council of Registrars.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, ICANN was formed by the U.S. government to phase out
NSI's exclusive hold on so-called top-level Web suffixes that
stretches back to 1993. Those domain names are considered prime
real estate destinations for selling goods and conducting business
on the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   The move delighted new cyber-landlords, such as AOL. ``We're
committed to an open, competitive environment on the Internet,''
AOL spokesman Jim Whitney said. ``There is a tremendous level of
commercial interest in opening the market for domain names
services.''
</P>
<P>
   The first wave of companies selected to compete against NSI will
undergo a two-month trial, starting Monday. When the two-month
trial is completed in late June, AT&AMP;T Corp. and 28 other companies
are expected to be allowed to compete against NSI, which has been
expanding its international business in anticipation of competition
in the new market.
</P>
<P>
   ``Domain-name services are still in an early age,'' NSI
spokesman Christopher Clough said. ``There will be 100 million
top-level names registered ending in .com, .org and .net in the
next several years. We couldn't do it all and welcome the help.''
</P>
<P>
   NSI will continue to maintain a master database of addresses.
The company will receive at least $9 for each domain name its
competitors register and will charge test registrars a one-time
licensing fee of $10,000 for software. Test registrars will also
pay a $5,000 annual accreditation fee to ICANN for administrative
costs.
</P>
<P>
   NSI charges $70 for registering a Web address for the first two
years, and $35 for each additional 12 months. But those prices are
likely to fall with a raft of competitors on the horizon.
</P>
<P>
   Until now, the Herndon, Va., company has been the only place to
go for addresses ending with .com, .org or .net. It has registered
three-fourths of the world's 5.5 million online addresses,
parlaying its government-backed monopoly on domain names into $93
million in sales last year. The company, which went public in
September 1997, has a market value of $2.84 billion.
</P>
<P>
   NSI's volatile stock soared more than 50 percent yesterday on
the news, to $92 per share.

DENVER SCHOOL HAS GOOD REPUTATION FOR SATS AND SPORTS
</HEADLINE>
  (Eds: 2nd take to move within 30 minutes.)

<P>
   LITTLETON, Colo. _ Columbine High School is like a lot of
suburban high schools, proud of its high SAT scores, proud of its
winning sports teams. Last Friday the school had a giant pep rally,
followed on Saturday night by a junior-senior prom for which
parents had raised $50,000 for a no-alcohol after-prom party.
</P>
<P>
   It was the kind of school where a teacher last year assigned her
students to read about the shooting at a high school in Jonesboro,
Ark., to help them understand the real world because nothing like
that could ever happen here.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought we lived in a bubble,'' said Josiah Pina, an
18-year-old senior who played on the school's championship football
team, known as the Rebels.
</P>
<P>
   And Columbine High School is like most high schools, divided
into various groups, from the jocks and preps who rule the halls to
stoners, skaters and freaks. And at Columbine there was also the
Trenchcoat Mafia, many of whom have chafed at the dominance and
arrogance of the jocks.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are cliques all over the place,'' said Meg Hains, a
16-year-old sophomore. ``You can't go to high school without
cliques.''
</P>
<P>
   Hains and her friends Jessica Jones, 15, and Erin Brinkley, 15,
who gathered outside the high school on Wednesday with hundreds of
other students, classified themselves as their own tiny group,
``the individuals.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We're the outsiders,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   The ``individuals'' shun clothes bought at the Gap and
Abercrombie &AMP; Fitch, the labels favored by the jocks and preps.
``We vowed we would never wear Abercrombie,'' said Jones, adding
that she could not afford the $30 shirts and $25 hats even if she
did like them.
</P>
<P>
   While Columbine is not as affluent as some other schools in the
area, there are many students who can afford the labels, and who
drive expensive cars.
</P>
<P>
   ``One jock has a Hummer,'' said Jones, whose father owns a candy
store, and who does not have her own car. ``He totaled one Hummer,
and his dad bought him another.''
</P>
<P>
   As she complained about how the jocks and preps looked down on
her and her friends, Emily Hackett _ dressed in a pale-green Gap
shirt, Levi Silvertab jeans and American Eagle sandals _ came up
and wrapped her arms around her.
</P>
<P>
   ``People ask me, `Why do you talk to her,' '' Emily said. ``I
say, `She's cool, she's my bud.' ''
</P>
<P>
   Glancing toward Hackett, Brinkley said, ``There's some nice
preps.''
</P>
<P>
   Yes, Hackett said, a lot of Columbine students do own cars.
``I'm getting a purple Jeep when I turn 16 in three months,'' she
said.
</P>
<P>
   Resentments and jealousies are as much a part of adolescence as
first dates and acne, and whatever divisions there were inside the
school before Tuesday, the members of the different groups stood
side by side on the grass Wednesday, weeping together, hugging and
exchanging survivors' stories. Individuals, preps, jocks, freaks
and skaters, they all seemed nice. They were polite to the throng
of reporters, patiently answering the same questions over and over.
Even in their shock and grief, many of the students were eager to
talk about their school.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everyone knows Columbine in Colorado,'' said Amy Staley, 15,
who is on the track team and just made the cheerleading squad. ``We
always have the first or highest SAT scores in Jefferson County.
The reason so many kids were in the library yesterday is because
they care about their grades. Everyone is always going in there to
read.''
</P>
<P>
   Staley's friend, Kim Mohracher, 15, who was standing nearby,
chimed in: ``Fifty kids in our school have straight A's. Over 200
have a 3.8.''
</P>
<P>
   Mohracher happens to have straight A's, as do two of her friends
who were huddled with her and Staley on Wednesday, Brooke Allison,
15, and Nicole Bucci, who is a star on the tennis team.
</P>
<P>
   As for safety at Columbine, the students say it never occurred
to them to worry. Metal detectors? Those are for urban schools.

 Column: Head of High-Tech Magazine Hopes Internet Stocks
Will  Rebound 
<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR;  &QL;  &LR; 
 &UR; By Dan Fost &QL;  &LR; 
 &UR; c 1999, San Francisco Chronicle &QL;  &LR; 
 &QL; 
Tony Perkins, the head of the high-tech investment magazine Red
Herring, hopes that giant hissing sound on Monday wasn't the air
going out of Internet stocks.
</P>
<P>
   That's funny, considering he's predicting their demise in a
book, ``The Internet Bubble.''
</P>
<P>
   But his book isn't due out until August. So when the Dow Jones
Internet index dropped nearly 19 percent on Monday, he got an
anxious call from his publisher, Harper Business Books.
</P>
<P>
   After all, who would buy a book called, ``After the Bubble: The
Internet Soap Stain Left on the Floor?''
</P>
<P>
   Perkins is keeping his fingers crossed for Net stocks to
continue swimmingly until his book comes out, at which point he
hopes that, uh, something ``hits the fan.''
</P>
<P>
   That sounds like potentially dangerous talk for a businessman in
Perkins' position. Consider:
</P>
<P>
   _The Herring is built on providing information about the
intersection of technology and money.
</P>
<P>
   _The Herring is retooling for the Internet. It plans to triple
its online staff and add subscriptions, services and e-commerce to
its existing banner ad and sponsorship business.
</P>
<P>
   _The Herring is likely to have its own public stock offering
sometime next year, although nothing has been formally decided.
</P>
<P>
   Perkins certainly is covering his bases: His business is staked
on Internet market success, while his book is staked on Internet
market failure.
</P>
<P>
   From his corner office on the ninth floor of the renovated
Hamm's Brewery building, Perkins looks down upon San Francisco's
Multimedia Gulch _ on dozens if not hundreds of companies hoping to
cash in on Internet dreams.
</P>
<P>
   Like those entrepreneurs, he is optimistic about the Net.
</P>
<P>
   But Perkins, who was a banker before he became a journalist,
remains a contrarian.
</P>
<P>
   ``This ain't real,'' he says. ``Show me the money.''
</P>
<P>
   &UR; SELLING SALON: &LR;  Technology journalists love checking the worth
of their erstwhile brethren who have jumped to the digital world.
(Some say those snooping journalists are jealous, but I would never
hang that label on them.)
</P>
<P>
   Salon.com, the San Francisco online media company, can't talk
about its intent to sell stock to the public because it's in an SEC
mandated ``quiet period.'' So, we'll let Salon's SEC filing do the
talking.
</P>
<P>
   David Talbot, the company's chairman and editor in chief, earned
$130,312 last year and received options to buy 175,000 shares.
Talbot already holds 600,000 shares. Salon expects to sell shares
for between $10.50 and $13.50; at the low end of that range,
Talbot's existing shares are worth $6.3 million.
</P>
<P>
   Talbot is the former arts and features editor of the San
Francisco Examiner, and many of his old colleagues are with him at
Salon as vice presidents.
</P>
<P>
   They include Vice President for Business Development Andrew
Ross, a former Examiner foreign and national editor, who holds
280,000 options; design director Mignon Khargie, a former Examiner
graphic artist, 260,000 options; executive editor Gary Kamiya, a
former Examiner senior editor, 240,000 options; and senior editor
for technology Scott Rosenberg, a former Examiner theater critic
and technology columnist, 100,000 options.
</P>
<P>
   At $10.50, a share, everyone with more than 100,000 shares is an
instant millionaire.
</P>
<P>
   Other former Examiner staffers already scored big on Wall Street
at CBS Marketwatch.com. Marketwatch's Larry Kramer and Thom
Calandra (the Examiner's former editor and business columnist,
respectively) are paper multimillionaires thanks to their firm's
successful sale of stock earlier this year.
</P>
<P>
   Newspapering never paid so well.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; MONEY IN THE WELL: &LR;  Another tidbit from Salon.com's SEC filing:
Salon forked over 4.4 percent of the company to buy pioneering
Internet community the WELL two weeks ago.
</P>
<P>
   If Salon goes public at $10.50, that stock would be worth $4.87
million _ a premium price for a company revealed in the filing to
have lost $69,000 on revenues of $484,000 last year.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; WHITHER WIRED DIGITAL: &LR;  Wired Digital has hit another speed
bump as it tries to become part of the Lycos Web portal. The sale
should have closed last month.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, the companies announced another delay. The deal first
announced in October will now close in June, they said.
</P>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR; For perspective, consider that America Online announced it
would buy Netscape in November for $10 billion _ one month after
the Wired Digital-Lycos announcement _ and it consummated that
merger last month.
</P>
<P>
   The latest snag in the $83 million deal for Wired Digital was
the Securities and Exchange Commission's request for more
information. Lycos filed a new document with the SEC last week, and
Wired officials say it could take a few weeks to hear if they've
satisfied the agency.
</P>
<P>
   The filing reveals that Wired founders Louis Rossetto and Jane
Metcalfe opposed the deal when it was first brought to the board of
directors. Published reports on Salon.com and TheStreet.com
revealed that Wired Digital's original investors were fighting with
the company's current big shareholders over who would get how much
in the Lycos deal.
</P>
<P>
   Compounding matters, Lycos is battling to convince its own
shareholders to let it merge with USA Networks, in what's turned
into a messy public fight.
</P>
<P>
   At least one person, who would only agree to be identified as a
source close to the Lycos-Wired Digital deal, said the deal may not
have the votes among Wired shareholders &UR;  &LR; to go forward, that the
shareholders are continuing to squabble, and that the SEC may not
sign off on the latest filings so readily.
</P>
<P>
   That sort of dissent, which has dogged the company for months,
upset Wired Digital spokesman Andrew de Vries. ``I am so tired of
this going on,'' he said. ``Until you have a stockholder vote, it's
all hearsay.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think any one person can say the deal is in
jeopardy,'' de Vries said. ``Everyone is fully committed to having
this deal close.''

 Cnet Beats Forecasts in `Blowout Quarter'   By Dan Fost 
<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR; c 1999, San Francisco Chronicle &QL;  &LR; 
 &QL; 
Cnet Inc., the San Francisco publisher of computer Web sites,
reported a strong quarter yesterday.
</P>
<P>
   The company doubled its revenues, beat analysts' estimates for
its earnings and announced a 2-for-1 stock split.
</P>
<P>
   ``Cnet had a blowout quarter,'' said Danny Rimer, an Internet
analyst with Hambrecht and Quist.
</P>
<P>
   For the three months that ended March 31, the company reported
net income of &UR;  &LR; $23 million (61 cents per share), compared to a loss
of $5.7 million in the same quarter last year. Revenues grew 101
percent, to $19.6 million from $9.8 million a year ago.
</P>
<P>
   Income exceeded revenues because the company reaped a $19.9
million windfall when BuyDirect.com _ in which Cnet was a
significant shareholder _ was acquired by Beyond.com.
</P>
<P>
   Not counting the profit from that sale, or the write-off of
$300,000 in expenses from a small Cnet acquisition, Cnet earnings
were $3.4 million.
</P>
<P>
   It was the company's fourth straight quarter to show a profit,
still a relative rarity among Internet firms.
</P>
<P>
   Cnet attributed its success to the growing popularity of the
company's Web sites. It writes &UR;  &LR; news and reviews about technology
products and provides a way for readers to link directly to
companies selling the products. Cnet makes money by selling
advertising and by charging companies for every business lead
generated on a Cnet site.
</P>
<P>
   Those leads have grown, from 90,000 per day in December to
104,000 per day in March.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've become a place that a lot of technology companies feel
they have to be,'' said Halsey Minor, Cnet's chief executive.
</P>
<P>
   While sales in Cnet's first quarter have typically dropped off
from the previous quarter, Minor said this year they remained
strong. This week, Cnet also announced a deal bringing more ads
from top computer-makers Dell, Compaq, Gateway and Acer.
</P>
<P>
   Most of Cnet's earnings come from its online business, but
yesterday's report revealed that its cable television programs also
brought in a slight profit, even as revenue slipped to $1.7 million
from $1.8 million last year.
</P>
<P>
   Cnet announced its earnings after the close of trading
yesterday. As tech stocks continued to rally from Monday's slump,
Cnet closed the day up $14.25 at $119.75.
</P>
<P>
   The stock split, scheduled for May 28, will affect shareholders
who own Cnet stock as of May 10.
</P>
<P>
   Along with many other Internet stocks, shares in Cnet have
soared this year. Since the start of the year, the stock is up
nearly 400 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Although the stock rose in part on rumors that some larger
company could acquire Cnet, Minor dispelled such talk. ``There's a
lot of growth ahead for the company,'' he said. ``Our shareholders
are better suited by the company remaining independent.''
</P>
<P>
   Noting that in the quarter, Cnet bought four smaller companies,
Minor said, ``I see us more as an `acquirer' than an `acquiree.'''
</P>
<P>
   Rimer, the analyst, agreed. ``There really is no need to be
consolidated. They will be able to enjoy being independent for a
long time,'' he said.

 Column: What $400 Will Buy In a PC System
<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR;  &QL;  &LR; 
 &UR; By David Einstein &QL;  &LR; 
 &UR; c 1999, San Francisco Chronicle &QL;  &LR; 
 &QL; 
 &UR; Question: &LR;  I have been asked to advise a school about purchasing
new computers. I know that E-Machines sells a system for $399, but
I recall also reading about another machine that goes for $299.
Unfortunately, I forgot its name and how to contact the company.
Any help would be appreciated.
</P>
<P>
   &LR;   &UR; Answer:  &LR; The company you're referring to is Microworkz
Computer, which is based in Seattle. Microworkz makes low-cost PCs
for the corporate market and recently announced it was getting into
the consumer space with a series of low-cost ``Webzter'' systems
designed for people who want a computer mainly for the Internet.
The low-end model, called the Webzter Jr., sells for $299. It
includes a 300-MHz Cyrix chip, 32 megabytes of memory, a
3.2-gigabyte hard drive and a 56K modem.
</P>
<P>
   However, it doesn't come with a floppy disk drive or a CD-ROM
drive, both of which are standard equipment on most PCs. They cost
an additional $99, which brings the price of the system up to $398.
</P>
<P>
   The $399 etower from Emachines features a 333-MHz Cyrix chip, 32
megs of memory, a 2.1-gig hard drive, a 56K modem and both CD-ROM
and floppy drives.
</P>
<P>
   Neither system comes with a monitor. So which one is a better
choice? Well, the Microworkz PC has a slightly bigger hard drive,
and it comes with Corel's WordPerfect software suite as well as a
year of free Internet access. But Emachines offers a faster chip as
well as a more powerful video subsystem, which means it should be
better at running video games.
</P>
<P>
   You can find the Emachines systems at Best Buy and other office
and computer stores. Microworkz is selling its systems directly
online at  &LR; www.webzterpc.com. &LR;
</P>
<P>
   E-Mail Problems
</P>
<P>
   Q: I have just installed the new Microsoft Internet Explorer 5,
which includes the latest version of Outlook Express. Now I can't
send e-mail. Every time I try, the computer attempts to use my old
GTE Internet account, which I canceled months ago when I switched
to Earthlink. Is there any way I can change the server on the
e-mail to Earthlink?
</P>
<P>
   A: There sure is. Open Outlook Express, then choose Accounts
from the Tools menu. Tab over to Mail and you should see all the
mail accounts that are set up for your system. If Earthlink is one
of them, select it and click the Set as Default button.
</P>
<P>
   If Earthlink isn't listed, you'll have to create a new mail
account. Click the Add button, then click Mail. The Internet
Connection Wizard will then guide you through the process. You'll
need the names of Earthlink's incoming and outgoing mail servers,
which Earthlink can provide.
</P>
<P>
   After creating the new account, set it as the default (if it's
the only one listed, it will automatically be the default). And
feel free to remove any accounts associated with your old GTE
connection.
</P>
<P>
   A Lost Address
</P>
<P>
   Q: How come in Microsoft Internet Explorer I don't have an
Address line? I had one before.
</P>
<P>
   A: Have you looked under your desk? Seriously though, you
probably disabled it inadvertently. To set things right, choose
Toolbars from Internet Explorer's View menu, then click Address
Bar. The Address Bar, which includes the space for Internet
addresses, should return to your desktop. Another way to do the
same thing is to right-click on any open space in the gray area at
the top of the screen and choose Address Bar.
</P>
<P>
   Y2K Worries
</P>
<P>
   Q: I have a Dell Optiplex GMT 5166 computer that I purchased in
February 1997. Am I likely to experience Year 2000 problems when
January 1 rolls around? If so, what can I do to prevent them?
</P>
<P>
   A: Computers built more than a year ago may have problems
recognizing the year 2000 _ which could lead to all kinds of
problems with software programs that take their cue from the
computer's clock. The two primary areas of concern are the BIOS,
which includes information the system needs when it starts up, and
the real-time-clock itself.
</P>
<P>
   Dell's Web site &LR;   &LR; ( &LR; www.dell.com &LR; ) &LR;   &LR; lists Y2K certification
status for its computers, and it shows that yours needs a BIOS
upgrade _ which you should be able to download from the Dell site.
Good luck.
</P>
<P>
   PC owners worried about Y2K can also put their minds at ease by
using a program such as Norton 2000 ($49.95) or McAfee 2000 Toolbox
($29.95). Both programs can diagnose _ and in some cases fix _
hardware problems, as well as deal with software applications that
could have Y2K glitches. Apple says its Macintoshes should not have
Y2K problems.
</P>
<P>
   &LR;  &QL; 
 &UR; TIP OF THE WEEK &LR;
</P>
<P>
   &LR;  &QL; 
 &LR; If you create and delete a lot of files and install and remove a
lot of programs, chances are that after a while your PC will slow
down because information on your hard disk gets all out of order.
To remedy the situation, give your disk a tune-up with Disk
Defragmenter, a utility program that comes with Windows. You'll
find it by clicking the Start button, then going to
Programs/Accessories/System Tools.

 &HT;    CNN taps local TV to get inside scoop
 &HT;    By Phil Kloer
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Despite scores of correspondents scattered throughout
the Balkans, tons of state-of-the-art equipment and hundreds of
thousands of dollars of satellite time, the most memorable images
on CNN recently have been courtesy of local TV news operations.
</P>
<P>
   Tuesday, it was the videos of the students fleeing the massacre
at Columbine High School and being reunited with their parents.
Last week, it was the dramatic helicopter rescue in Atlanta of
Ivers Sims from his crane above the raging fire.
</P>
<P>
   While CNN is mostly on its own covering the war in Yugoslavia,
these sudden outbursts of domestic news get instant coverage
because of Newsource, CNN's long-standing arrangement with about
600 TV stations around the country. It also allows CNN to cover a
story before its own reporters can get in place and to switch among
stations _ four, in Denver's case _ sharing footage with CNN.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's incredibly critical,'' said Earl Casey, CNN senior vice
president of newsgathering, who coordinated the feeds from Denver
stations Tuesday that CNN aired to the nation.
</P>
<P>
   A Denver TV station called CNN when the story broke, before
anyone knew how serious it was, and Casey started watching KUSA,
the NBC affiliate in Denver, eventually putting it on the air. At
the same time, CNN was arranging with the ABC, CBS and Fox
affiliates to get their signals to Atlanta via satellite and
fiber-optic cable links.
</P>
<P>
   The four signals were eventually fed into the main control room
in CNN Center, where producers could pick and choose which station
to carry.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're looking at the monitors, and they see some coverage
they want to go to, or they see some footage that they don't want
to carry,'' Casey said.
</P>
<P>
   Although CNN is based in Atlanta, it relied on local TV for its
coverage of Sims' rescue last week, mainly because the stations
already had news helicopters in the air covering the fast-breaking
story. For a while, WXIA chopper pilot Bruce Erion became the voice
of CNN.
</P>
<P>
   CNN has had news-sharing arrangements with stations virtually
since the network was launched in 1980, but in the early days the
links were more informal. In the mid-'80s, CNN began to package its
coverage as Newsource and sell it to stations for a fee, and part
of those deals was that the stations would share their news footage
with CNN. As another part of Newsource, the stations can use CNN's
live signal or packages; the biggest usage was during the Persian
Gulf War.
</P>
<P>
   The sharing also allows one Newsource station to use another
one's in its broadcast area, using CNN as a connection. Thus
Atlanta's WSB, an ABC affiliate, used footage Tuesday from Denver's
KUSA, an NBC affiliate.
</P>
<P>
   The links were also crucial after the Oklahoma City bombing in
1995 and the crash of a Valujet airplane in Florida in 1996, when
local reporters covered the scene until CNN personnel arrived.
</P>
<P>
   ``You're dealing with TV stations with scores of journalists who
know the community down to the intersections,'' Casey said.
``There's an informational and community richness that comes to us.

 &HT;    Parents should reassure kids in wake of horror, experts say
 &HT;    By Lillian Lee Kim
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ The tragedy of Littleton, Colo., is a relatively
isolated incident that will never be repeated at the overwhelming
majority of schools, crime statistics show.
</P>
<P>
   But the horror of what happened in Littleton _ and Springfield,
Ore., Jonesboro, Ark., West Paducah, Ky. and Pearl, Miss. _ does
touch kids everywhere. Parents trying to reassure their children in
the wake of Tuesday's shootings must be careful not to say, ``That
could never happen here,'' say mental health and education experts.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's important to put this in perspective,'' said Dr. Arthur
Kellerman, director of the Center for Injury Control at Emory
University. ``The chances that this will happen in your child's
school are very, very, very remote. But the chance is not zero.
</P>
<P>
   ``You have to acknowledge that this was a real event, a real
tragedy. Kids are not stupid.''
</P>
<P>
   June Arnette, associate director of the National School Safety
Center, echoed this sentiment.
</P>
<P>
   ``Don't promise your kids that harm won't come their way,
because you can't make that promise,'' Arnette said. ``But as a
parent, you can provide encouragement. Schools are the safest place
for kids to be, safer than roaming the streets or hanging out at
the mall. We can let our kids know this.''
</P>
<P>
   Massacres may be relatively rare in schools, but violent crimes
aren't, according to a 1997 study by the National Center for
Education Statistics that analyzed violence and disciplinary
problems in U.S. public schools during the 1996-97 school year.
</P>
<P>
   The study concluded that 1 in 10 public schools experienced one
or more serious violent crimes, including murder, rape, suicide,
assault or robbery, during that school term.
</P>
<P>
   A 1995 survey by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention
found that about 10 percent of high school students had carried
some kind of weapon, such as a gun, knife or club, on school
property within the 30 days before the survey.
</P>
<P>
   More than 8 percent of high school students in the survey said
they had been recently threatened or injured with a weapon on
school property.
</P>
<P>
   Those victimized by violent acts _ and even some who witness
them _ can experience post-traumatic stress disorder.
</P>
<P>
   Teens are no exception, said behavioral psychologist Stephen
Thomas of Emory University.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is a normal response in the face of tragedy to be
traumatized,'' Thomas said. ``Those kids who were running out of
that school with their hands above their heads were traumatized.
They all had experienced conditions of war.''
</P>
<P>
   Teens who remain severely frightened or shocked by what they saw
happening in Littleton should seek counseling.
</P>
<P>
   And parents, teachers and counselors should be on lookout for
symptoms of extreme or lasting anxiety over the incident, and help
teens get help.
</P>
<P>
   ``Right now there are kids in metro Atlanta who feel they're
scared, because it conjures up and triggers their own pain and loss
and grief,'' Thomas said.

 &HT;    Tragedy can teach sanctity of life, love
 &HT;    By Bill Hendrick
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ They shatter our sense of well-being, our collective
delusion that life is good and fair, and force us to question the
most fundamental characteristic of humanity _ optimism.
</P>
<P>
   That's why tragedies such as the mass killings in Colorado this
week seem to strike such intense fear, confusion _ even grief _ in
nearly everyone, many experts say.
</P>
<P>
   ``Things like this, they make us question our fundamental
principles about the world, about life,'' says Dr. Ken Pargament, a
psychologist at Bowling Green State University. ``How do you square
such a tragedy with your hope and belief that the world is a place
that's improving, that people are basically good, and life is a
good thing? You can't.''
</P>
<P>
   No one wants to believe it, but bad things do happen to good
people, every day, every minute, he says. And it's the
headline-grabbing tragedies, not the daily ones, he adds, that
force us to face up to this harsh fact.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is the kind of thing that makes people develop a more
realistic view of the world, a world that is random and
uncertain,'' says Pargament, author of ``Psychology of Religion and
Coping.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Traditionally, religion has offered ways for people to deal
with the downside of life. But these terrible tragedies make even
the religious question their beliefs, their faith.''
</P>
<P>
   The Rev. Nancy Oliver, minister of children and youth at
Peachtree Christian Church, said such tragedies are hard to deal
with ``because you're dealing with a good God, but at the same
time, you're dealing with the condition of humankind, and humankind
can be pretty evil at times.''
</P>
<P>
   She said she's publishing in her upcoming weekly newsletter an
article on violence prevention that suggests parents help their
children develop problem-solving skills, and model those skills at
home.
</P>
<P>
   But Dr. Neil Bernstein of Johns Hopkins University, the author
of several books on teen-age rebellion, said parents need to work
on skills, too _ learning to recognize warning signs.
</P>
<P>
   ``These are not random occurrences,'' he said. ``The public
needs to realize this. These things are well understood, and they
do happen for a reason. We just miss the cues, the warning signs.
Every once in a blue moon, you get some crazy who runs out and does
this. But this is a behavior contagion. It's catching. Other crazy,
disturbed kids are seeing it on TV and saying, `maybe that's what I
should do.'''
</P>
<P>
   Many experts believe that's why similar incidents have been
occurring for two years or more in the United States. Since Jan.
27, 1997, at least 34 students or faculty members have been killed
in their schools.
</P>
<P>
   The odds remain astronomical against it happening to you or even
someone you know, ``but unfortunately the odds are growing because
of the accessibility of firearms to minors,'' said Olaf Vancura, a
physicist in Las Vegas and expert on odds.
</P>
<P>
   ``These are not natural disasters. People can be influenced by
prior events. There probably is a trend where, once this happens,
it may continue to grow, unlike other disasters. People who might
be inclined to do this may be biased by what they see has
happened.''
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Karamo Barrow of Clark Atlanta University agreed, and said
history holds little solace for those who believe such events are
aberrations.
</P>
<P>
   ``This has been happening always,'' he said. ``Man's cruelty to
one another is all through the pages of history. Kids are
neglected. People don't have time for life, or even for each
other.''
</P>
<P>
   But that doesn't mean the situation is hopeless, he added.
</P>
<P>
   Pargament said religion offers people a way to deal with
feelings of hopelessness and that beliefs shouldn't be questioned
``because of these events that we cannot hope to understand.''
</P>
<P>
   He thinks tragedies can lead people to a deeper appreciation of
life and a need for religion and spirituality.
</P>
<P>
   The Rev. Ted Wardlaw of Central Presbyterian Church met
Wednesday with a clergy group that gathers monthly and said he had
``taken great solace from coming together as a community.''
</P>
<P>
   He said people also can find solace in action.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of people are talking right now about the conversations
they want to have with their children, the new initiatives they
want to take as parents, and as part of the community,'' he said.
``To the extent that people who are moved by this tragedy can put
that into action, that has its own power to console.''
</P>
<P>
   Anne Wimberly, a professor of Christian education at the
Interdenominational Theological Center in Atlanta, said parents
should carve out times to spend with their children to prevent them
from veering off into dangerous directions.
</P>
<P>
   ``That often means turning off the TV, structuring family time
to actually sit and eat together,'' she said. ``A lot of parents
and kids don't know how to relate to one another. They have to sit
down, share with one another and learn how to listen all over
again.''
</P>
<P>
   And prayer also helps, she said.
</P>
<P>
   But Pargament said tragedies such as airplane crashes, fatal car
wrecks or tornadoes raise deep and profound questions.
</P>
<P>
   ``Most religions don't say God is a good father who will make
things turn out well for everyone,'' he said. ``It's hard to square
the idea that God really isn't there directing every event in life,
he's not a master puppeteer pulling all the strings.''
</P>
<P>
   He said people should take solace in the notion that ``we on
Earth are the ones responsible for trying to make the world a
better place. We have an obligation to try to make the world more
just, and to create God's kingdom on Earth. It's up to us. That's a
richer religious view of the world than one that just says God is
someone in heaven who ensures that good things happen to good
people.
</P>
<P>
   ``Out of this terrible situation, it pushes some people to
develop a more intricate and richer spirituality,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Clark Atlanta's Barrow said the tragedy should alert Americans
to the idea that we need each other.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you are taught love, you give love,'' he said. ``Society is
so highly technological, most families do not have time for each
other. We're all spread out. We ought to learn from this.'' Staff
writers Gayle White and John Blake contributed to this story.

 &HT;    It's culture that's sick, not kids
 &HT;    By Martha Ezzard
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ From Columbine High School you can see the spring snow
in conelike ripples across the mountain backdrop of southwest
Denver. High in the meadows of the Rockies, wild columbine, the
state flower that blooms in delicate pastels, is coming to life.
</P>
<P>
   But a pall hovers over a school where affluent kids would
normally be celebrating fresh snow for spring skiing. Except for
the setting, the bodies in the school library might have been a
scene from the mountains of Kosovo. Innocent victims. Random
killings signaling hatred and disregard for human life.
</P>
<P>
   Ironic that the Colorado killings were the same week of the 1995
Oklahoma City bombing. Those horror scenes still come to mind when
I hear the strains of ``Oklahoma!,'' which used to summon up
visions of waving wheat and checkered gingham.
</P>
<P>
   Now it's going to be the same with that majestic, laid-back,
ski-crazy place where my husband and I raised three youngsters and
loved every minute of the Rocky Mountain outdoors. We bought the
first house we ever owned in Littleton, two Southerners
deliberately choosing the Western lifestyle for our young family.
We moved to a neighboring suburb just before our third child was
born and stayed for 20 years. Our oldest daughter and her family
live there still, a great place to raise kids _ horses, hiking,
sledding and all. And public schools that rate among the best in
the nation.
</P>
<P>
   Less than an hour away from the heart-broken community, the
state Legislature adjourned Wednesday in deference to a grieving
public. Contrary to Colorado's reliable spring snows, the state's
political climate is dramatically different from the past. A
two-party state ever since the Watergate election, Colorado now has
two Republican senators and a conservative governor. In a
legislative session local pundits say should have been dominated by
growth, transportation and education issues, gun bills got the most
attention. Lawmakers were bent on making it easier for folks to
carry concealed weapons in public places _ zoos, movie theaters,
restaurants.
</P>
<P>
   Even school grounds aren't exempted in the radical measure that
cleared the Senate, had the support of the governor but was tabled
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Guns are part of the West, some say. But cowboys don't carry
semiautomatics. Cowboys don't build bombs. The Littleton our family
knows is a far cry from combat boots and Gothic violence.
</P>
<P>
   Its historic Main Street has a rodeo atmosphere. Every July,
cowpokes, young and old, gather for the town's annual Western
Welcome parade, complete with country music, American flags, and
buffalo burgers. A piece of Americana that even the area's
burgeoning growth and traffic, similar to Atlanta's, hasn't
disturbed.
</P>
<P>
   The National Rifle Association meets in Denver this weekend, and
billboards along freeways have giant pictures of Charlton Heston
declaring ``the NRA needs YOU.'' But what's the connection? The
school shootings would have occurred whether the NRA were headed
for Denver or not _ and the NRA-backed gun bills aren't law yet.
</P>
<P>
   The gun-toting suspects were outcasts, part of a small group of
misfits. But haven't there always been those in every class in
every generation? Troublemakers, bullies, weirdos who picked fights
or pulled an occasional pocketknife in my time. What's changed?
What turned teenage misfits into killers?
</P>
<P>
   A culture that glorifies violence _ schools too big and parents
too busy to spot youngsters in need of individual attention?
There's something else. Troubled kids have always acted out. Now
they can do it in a deadly and permanent way. They can get
semiautomatics, mimic violent movies, click on the Internet and
learn bomb-making.
</P>
<P>
   You never know when tragedy will mark a turning point.
Conservative state Rep. Gary McPherson announced after the
shootings that he was also tabling his bill to bar local
governments from having gun control restrictions.
</P>
<P>
   There's a feeling we should all be doing something. Kids aren't
more violent or sick or weird than they used to be. Our culture is.
Our politics are.

 &HT;    Shootings spark online dialogue
 &HT;    By Frances Katz
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ``I don't have the answers, does anyone?'' asked one participant
in a live chat on America Online focusing on the massacre at
Columbine High School in Littleton, Colo.
</P>
<P>
   Parents and students from all over the country logged in in
large numbers to AOL's moderated chat area ``The Globe'' (keyword:
AOL Live) to offer observations and try to make some sense out of
the shootings.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the participants _ who numbered more than 600 at a time
by day's end _ were online searching for answers.
</P>
<P>
   ``They are called public schools because we, the public, are in
charge,'' wrote one chat participant. ``GET INVOLVED,'' she typed
in large letters.
</P>
<P>
   As parents discussed the relative merits of teaching their
children more spiritual values at home and keeping a vigilant eye
out for loner or isolationist behavior, the teens who were taking
part in the chat spoke more passionately about more personal high
school traumas, such being unable to fit in. They talked about
``cliques'' that ridicule and ostracize perceived outsiders.
</P>
<P>
   ``Going to high school is a stressful experience for anyone,''
added another member, ``not just the outcasts. And I know plenty of
kids like the Trench Coat Mafia who would bully people better than
the jocks could.''
</P>
<P>
   Some parents tried to blame the techno or heavy metal music
teens listen to, but one teen burst in saying, ``It's not the music
or anything else, it's mental illness.''
</P>
<P>
   Added a high school English teacher, ``Parents do not seem to
care what their kids do as long as they don't have to deal with
it.''
</P>
<P>
   ``You just have to keep shouting until someone takes this
seriously,'' said someone else.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, AOL's message boards, a popular retreat for AOL's
teen members to talk about things that matter to them were so
jammed by midday Wednesday that access was next to impossible. By
late Wednesday afternoon, more than 100,000 members had posted
comments and opinion.
</P>
<P>
   AOL's Digital City Denver (http://denver.digitalcity.com) also
offered areas for local residents to share their feelings about the
tragedy.
</P>
<P>
   Local residents, as well as Web users from around the country
who wanted to express their feelings to the families in Littleton
posted messages in Digital City's ``Reaction Board.'' Most
expressed their deep sorrow to their neighbors and wondered, along
with the rest of the country, how this could have happened.
</P>
<P>
   ``If the two killers were considered strange and openly made
threats to some of the students, how come this never came to the
attention of any of the teachers?'' asked a user named Nicky.
</P>
<P>
   Another member wrote, ``We should help the problem kids instead
of ignoring the fact and hope it will go away. Wake up everybody.''
</P>
<P>
   But another user stressed the problem was not with teen-age
outcasts. ``This kind of thing did not happen in our high schools
of days past. There were plenty of outcasts then also,'' read one
post. ``There is something more insidious here.''
</P>
<P>
   But what that is remains a mystery to the thousands of members
sharing their thoughts and feelings on AOL.

GUNS AND ALIENATION FUEL TEEN-AGERS TO VIOLENCE, EXPERTS SAY 
</HEADLINE>
  (nk) 
 By TIMOTHY EGAN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEATTLE _ The fact that the worst school shooting in modern
times happened in one of those places where Americans tend to move
because they are seeking good schools _ in this case, Jefferson
County, Colo., one of the fastest-growing areas in the nation _
came as no surprise to Suzanne Wilson.
</P>
<P>
   Propelled by grief, Ms. Wilson has spent the last year trying to
make sense of the recent carnage in playgrounds and libraries. She
lost her own daughter, Brittheny, to a pair of middle school
students in Jonesboro, Ark., last year.
</P>
<P>
   She has listened to all the psychiatrists, the school
counselors, the lawyers and specialists in youth violence, and what
she has concluded is that places that might seem least likely to
yield horrific violence are the very places where Americans should
look for answers.
</P>
<P>
   In these towns _ the Springfield, Ore., of new malls and big
houses on one-acre lots, the West Paducah, Ky., of horse trails and
tree forts where Tom Sawyer would be at home _ the details of
school slaughters follow a pattern.
</P>
<P>
   Once again, a mixture of heavy firepower, alienated youths whose
threats were largely ignored, and popular culture with a violent
and nihilistic message is predominant.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our children are telling us things and we are not hearing
them,'' Ms. Wilson said. ``The other thing is that, the children in
these cases all have guns. These wouldn't be massacres if they
involved just knives or baseball bats.''
</P>
<P>
   The guns used on Tuesday _ two shotguns, a semi-automatic pistol
and a 9-mm. semi-automatic assault rifle _ would fit in the arsenal
of the culprits in other major school shootings.
</P>
<P>
   Whether details about the weapons will alter the debate over gun
control, now focused on laws requiring adults who own guns to keep
them under lock and key, is hard to judge. But on Wednesday, a bill
that would have loosened controls on people who carry concealed
weapons was pulled from the Colorado Legislature, after it had
looked as if it would pass.
</P>
<P>
   The initial sketch of the teen-age shooters _ described by
friends as bright, scornful of authority, with eccentricities that
should have set off alarms _ also matched that of other children
with guns and grudges.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is clear these youths were having significant problems,''
said Dr. Beatrix Hamburg, a New York psychiatrist who is the
co-author of ``Violence in America's Schools,'' (Cambridge
University Press, 1998). ``In most of these cases, there are lots
of symptoms. But teachers ignore them, because they are not trained
to respond to them.''
</P>
<P>
   Finding common symptoms and patterns to school shootings may be
the easy part. The more troubling question, perhaps, is why the
normal problems of adolescence seem to be resolved now in
extraordinary spasms of violence.
</P>
<P>
   Some of the shooters and victims in Tuesday's killings were
supposed to meet several months ago in a rumble pitting students
known as the Trenchcoat Mafia against the athletes _ Goths vs.
Jocks, as some students described it. It was going to be a
fistfight to settle a feud, and it certainly would not have made
news.
</P>
<P>
   But that fight never happened. Instead, a slaughter unfolded
over fours hours in the suburb south of Denver, going from the
parking lot to the cafeteria to the library, where most of the
bodies were found.
</P>
<P>
   So, once again, what lingers is a question that begs for
clarity: why a massacre instead of slugfest? Was that lethal virus
so many experts spoke of last year loose again in the culture?
</P>
<P>
   In pure numbers, no. School violence is way down from highs of
five years ago, and, until yesterday, this school year was shaping
up as the safest one in a decade, according to the National School
Safety Center of Westlake Village, Calif., which monitors lethal
action in schools.
</P>
<P>
   In the 1993-94 academic year, for example, 52 children were
killed in school violence nationwide. Last year the toll was 42.
With barely two months to go in this school year, the tally stood
at nine.
</P>
<P>
   After more than a decade of sharp increases, homicides by
juveniles dropped substantially in 1995, and continued to fall for
the next two years.
</P>
<P>
   Similarly, though the police in Colorado described the shooting
as a ``suicide mission,'' youth suicide is down from the highs of
the early 1990s.
</P>
<P>
   What remains high is the number of guns in schools. More than
6,000 students were expelled in the 1996-97 school year _ the last
full year for figures _ for bringing guns to school, according to a
study issued by the Department of Education. These numbers are
among the highest recorded.
</P>
<P>
   To the police officers who saw the bloodied bodies of students
in the Columbine High School library or the teacher who died while
cowering in a closet, the national numbers and trends provide few
answers.
</P>
<P>
   Asked about a motive for the shooting, Sheriff John Stone said,
``A dysfunctional individual, several dysfunctional individuals.''
He paused. ``I don't see any motive,'' he said, then added, ``I get
a real concern with people who identify with Adolf Hitler as a
hero.''
</P>
<P>
   Acquaintances of some of the youths said they were fans of
Hitler, and the shooting happened on Tuesday to commemorate the
birthday of the Nazi dictator.
</P>
<P>
   Hitler-worship, if openly expressed, is certainly something that
would have touched off alarm among teachers. But schools today are
so focused on test scores, and not emotional train wrecks, that
they are missing the real problems, some experts say.
</P>
<P>
   ``The problem is that we don't have any place in our society
where we help kids systematically think through emotions,'' said
Dr. John Coie, a professor of psychiatry at Duke University.
</P>
<P>
   Coie said he feared a copycat pattern: that one school shooting
sets off another, because the action validates a fantasy of someone
who would normally not be moved to violence. As such, judging from
the body count, that pattern is escalating.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's what really scares me,'' Coie said. ``Kids who are
looking at these other examples must be talking to themselves about
how they can create a bigger massacre.''
</P>
<P>
   Other experts say simply that many American youths _
particularly those enamored of violent video games and musicians
who sing of suicide and death as others once sang of love and
freedom _ do not have a strong concept of the consequences of
violence.
</P>
<P>
   In the Colorado killings, acquaintances said the shooters were
fans of Marilyn Manson, a pop artist who caters to the nihilistic
impulses of some teen-agers, and was a hero to shooters in other
cases.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you consider this age developmentally, a lot of these
kids don't have a concept of death yet,'' said Dr. Richard
Lieberman, a school psychologist with the Los Angeles Unified
School District. ``They view it as magical, reversible, and
temporary.''
</P>
<P>
   And now, as the images of graphic death at a house of learning
are shown on television, many parents try to shield their children.
But Wilson, who lost her daughter to violence in Jonesboro, thinks
it is better for people to feel a taste of sorrow.
</P>
<P>
   ``We teach our children, `Thou Shalt Not Kill,' and then we let
them play hours and hours of the most violent video games,'' said
Ms. Wilson. ``I say let the children go to funerals. Let them see
what happens after the shots are fired. Let's show them the empty
bedroom. Let them know that death is final.''

 &HT;    Death in our schools
 &HT;    By Staff reports
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ It's hard _ terribly hard _ to wrap your mind around
the tragedy at Columbine High School. It's like trying to wrap your
arms around the world; it's just too much. And at times like this
when the brain goes numb, other organs pick up the slack. You feel
this thing in your gut and in your heart ... fear, confusion and a
profound respect for the grief that the people of Littleton, Colo.,
must be enduring.
</P>
<P>
   But the mind is a stubborn thing. It keeps asking questions, the
same questions of how and why, even when no answers are likely to
come. We call it meaningless violence, then sift through its rubble
for meaning.
</P>
<P>
   In the wake of such tragedy, we take for granted that something
important must have changed, that something's gone terribly wrong.
And the sad fact is, that may not be true. History, religion,
psychology _ every discipline for understanding the human mind
tells us that the capacity for such violence has always existed and
probably always will. We have built cultures and civilizations and
communities in an attempt to restrain the darkness, but sometimes
the restraints simply fail, as they did Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   But where did the restraints fail, and how can we patch the
fabric of society so it doesn't fail again? If the capacity for
violence is a trait of our species, this particular manifestation _
the mass slaughter of children by children _ is indeed something
new.
</P>
<P>
   Guns are part of it. They are not merely physically accessible;
they are psychologically accessible as well. Our children _
particularly adolescent boys _ have seen countless examples in the
movies, on television, video games and elsewhere in which anger is
satisfied by the pulling of a trigger. It is entertainment, for
most people pleasing but not provoking of that ancient portion of
our brain where the urge to violence lingers.
</P>
<P>
   For most people ... but not all. Eyewitness accounts of the
slaughter Tuesday indicate that the two armed students took
coldblooded joy in their killing and in the terror they inflicted.
</P>
<P>
   Some want to draw the line right there, indicting the mass-media
culture for violence but dismissing the easy availability of
firearms as a factor. In other words, ``Guns don't kill people;
movies kill people.'' That's foolish. The potentially deadly
emotions that drive violence _ greed, anger, hate, jealousy _
become far more deadly when expressed with a gun. Any society that
refuses to acknowledge that fact dooms itself to a repetition of
such tragedies.
</P>
<P>
   In circumstances such as these, questions about parenting are
also inevitable and probably appropriate. It is hard to believe
that mothers and fathers fully involved in the lives of their
children could have missed the signs leading up to Tuesday's
massacre. On the other hand, we've only seen the end result of the
lives of the two killers; school officials, for example, report
that the boys involved had no history of discipline problems.
</P>
<P>
   Believe it or not, the late 20th century has no monopoly on poor
parenting; in fact, parents today face unique challenges. In our
mobile society, many American parents don't have an extended family
to fall back on, as their own parents and grandparents did. And
where parents were once the major source of information and
influence over the lives of their children, they now compete with a
range of outside influences that are difficult to control.
</P>
<P>
   When first lady Hillary Rodham Clinton proposed that ``it takes
a village to raise a child,'' she took a lot of criticism for
making a statement that is true on its face. The village might be a
town, a neighborhood, a community, a school, but even in our
individualistic culture, raising children is a communal task. When
the village fails, the village pays the consequences. And when guns
are more available than counseling, we've got some rethinking to
do.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, it was troubling to hear the students at Columbine High
speak so matter-of-factly about the isolation to which they had
condemned the members of the ``Trench Coat Mafia.'' The
cliquishness of high school life has long been a part of growing
up, but the massacre Tuesday exposed something particularly
aggressive and cold. Too many Columbine students apparently came to
believe that the best way to define themselves, to elevate
themselves in their own eyes and the eyes of others, was to
identify, isolate and belittle those who were different.
</P>
<P>
   Now where would they get a strange idea like that?

STAR WARS COLLECTORS HAVE OUT-OF-THIS-WORLD FUN

 c.1999 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEATTLE _ The Force pulsates through the front door.
</P>
<P>
   Turn the knob. Walk in. Slowly.
</P>
<P>
   Look out! It's Darth Vader, 7 feet tall, leering in the foyer.
His red and green chest lights flash mean and fast.
</P>
<P>
   Dash to the bedroom. More trouble. A blaster-toting Imperial
Stormtrooper is crouched in a corner.
</P>
<P>
   Gotta escape! Where? Think. The back patio.
</P>
<P>
   Almost there.... A few more steps.... Oh no!
</P>
<P>
   Boba Fett is blocking the way _ and his laser is about to get
personal.
</P>
<P>
   Doom looms. Then, from out of the blue, a voice of salvation:
</P>
<P>
   ``How would you like some of my world-famous spaghetti sauce?''
</P>
<P>
   Welcome to the universe _ actually the Kirkland, Wash., home _
of Lauren Bock, where a zeal for ``Star Wars'' and homemade Italian
cooking makes for out-of-this-world fun.
</P>
<P>
   Bock and his family are among the top collectors of ``Star
Wars'' memorabilia in the Pacific Northwest. He has almost every
boxed action figure connected to George Lucas' popular movie
trilogy.
</P>
<P>
   All told, more than 4,000 4-inch and 12-inch ``Star Wars''
dolls, including vintage items, populate his home.
</P>
<P>
   Now, with excitement building for next month's premiere of
``Star Wars: Episode I _ The Phantom Menace,'' it's boom time for
Bock and other collectors.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, a video crew from cable TV's Sci-Fi Channel dropped
by to tape a show due out in early May. The topic? ``Star Wars''
uber-fans.
</P>
<P>
   Bock says he has been spending $100-a-day on stuff related to
the saga _ from bar soap with a tiny R2D2 inside to his latest
find: Star Wars shampoo.
</P>
<P>
   Since the series kicked off in the late 1970s, sales of ``Star
Wars'' toys, games, soundtracks and books have topped $4 billion,
according to Warman's Today's Collector Magazine, a leading trade
publication. And `Phantom's'' spinoff sales alone could break the
$1 billion mark, analysts say.
</P>
<P>
   In recent years, Bock has forked out tens of thousands of
dollars for his still-growing stash. The 57-year-old retired
insurance adjuster got his purchasing power after taking a big
gamble: He sold off two rental properties and put the profits,
along with part of an inheritance, into Microsoft stock in the late
'80s. ``My toy money,'' he jokes.
</P>
<P>
   A 5-by-6-foot model of the spaceship Millennium Falcon, its gun
turrets pumping red lasers, swoops from his living room ceiling. A
television, 65 inches wide, blares ``The Empire Strikes Back''
(Bock's favorite flick). The walls of his hallways are blanketed
with signed pictures from stars of the space trilogy. Need to go to
the bathroom? Be forewarned... eyes from hundreds of creatures from
a galaxy far, far away will be on you.
</P>
<P>
   But these items are just the trailer before the main attraction.
</P>
<P>
   Bock's best stuff is in an upstairs bedroom and in the basement.
Both rooms are brimming with ``Star Wars'' paraphernalia: Two
pinball machines, two stand-alone arcade games and two
wood-and-glass cases chock-full of dolls, ceramic cookie jars and
Frisbee-size rubber molds used to make ``Star Wars'' commemorative
coins.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's just so much fun,'' Bock gushes, his arms spread high and
wide. ``God, it's great!''
</P>
<P>
   It's the second Wednesday of April, and Bock's home is
officially Sarlacc's Pit _ named after Lucas' omnivorous,
multi-tentacled creature with sharp teeth. Pit members have
fashioned an appropriate acronym: Seattle ARea Lucasfilm Artifacts
Collectors Club.
</P>
<P>
   The monthly gathering brings together more than 40 people who
watch ``Star Wars'' videos, dress up in movie costumes and weigh
the latest flick gossip. They also clear up misinformation _ the
bane of the serious collector. But in no way, they insist, do
members ``geek out.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We are not like Trekkies,'' says one visitor.
</P>
<P>
   This meeting, however, is particularly festive. Maybe it's
because the prequel is about a month away, or because the sun is
out or because the Sci-Fi Channel crew is giddy to have the members
circle a table and parody a meeting of Alcoholics Anonymous. (``Hi,
my name is Bill. I'm a Star War-holic.'')
</P>
<P>
   In any case, light sabers are swinging. One pair of excited
members, wielding toy sabers that go vhronn

GORTON EASES BACK ON TRADE STANCE AGAINST CHINA 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By MICHAEL PAULSON  
 c.1999 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Sen. Slade Gorton, one of the few elected officials
from Washington state who has resisted granting normal trading
status to China, on Wednesday said he is now prepared to support
permanent normalized trade relations with the world's largest
nation.
</P>
<P>
   Gorton, R-Wash., said he is modifying his position as a result
of a conversation he had Tuesday night with U.S. Trade
Representative Charlene Barshefsky, who outlined a series of
concessions China has agreed to make if it is admitted to the World
Trade Organization.
</P>
<P>
   China is aggressively pushing to win entry to the organization
before a new round of global trade talks is launched at a WTO
meeting in Seattle in November.
</P>
<P>
   Among the concessions China has agreed to are several that would
affect important Washington state industries, including apple
growers, paper producers, software manufacturers and The Boeing Co.
As a goodwill gesture, China has already agreed to drop its
longstanding ban on importing wheat from the Pacific Northwest.
</P>
<P>
   But the United States also would have to take a difficult step.
If China is admitted to the World Trade Organization, Congress
would have to agree to grant China permanent most-favored-nation
trade status, which despite its name is the trade status enjoyed by
all but a handful of U.S. trading partners.
</P>
<P>
   ``I haven't had to vote on most favored nation status for five
or six years, but I've been opposed or very skeptical, because we
were making our markets open and they weren't,'' Gorton said in an
interview Wednesday. ``What I hope and believe is that that will no
longer be the case.''
</P>
<P>
   Gorton said he does not believe that the issues of human rights,
spying, or Taiwan should be tied to the trade issue. He said that
if Barshefsky presents in writing the deal that she outlined to him
Tuesday night, he will vote to grant China permanent most favored
nation status.
</P>
<P>
   ``If what she outlined comes to pass, I would vote to ratify,''
he said.
</P>
<P>
   Gorton now joins Sen. Patty Murray, D-Wash., who has been a
consistent champion of admitting China to the WTO, and the rest of
the members of the Washington state congressional delegation, as
well as the state's most prominent business executives. The only
member of Congress from Washington state who last year opposed
normal trade status for China was Rep. Linda Smith, a Republican
who gave up her seat in an unsuccessful bid to unseat Murray.
</P>
<P>
   Gorton's support was welcomed by several groups, including apple
growers whose exports to China have been stymied by high tariffs.
</P>
<P>
   ``Slade stood firm demanding that certain objectives be achieved
before he would lend his support to China's entry into the World
Trade Organization, and his position has largely been rewarded,''
said Kraig Naasz, president of the U.S. Apple Association and a
onetime Gorton aide. ``It's critical that the U.S. Congress now
extend to China normal trade relations, because until that has been
achieved, industries like ours won't be permitted to take advantage
of the concessions China has made.''
</P>
<P>
   Patricia Davis, president of the Washington Council on
International Trade, called the magnitude of concessions agreed to
by China ``amazing.''
</P>
<P>
   ``China came a long, long way,'' she said. ``Sen. Gorton has
been concerned about our deficit with China, and if this deal helps
open our export markets, it should help to address that deficit.''
</P>
<P>
   U.S. negotiators are now in China holding meetings to resolve
remaining differences. But the negotiators have already resolved
their disagreements over the trade of agriculture and goods.
</P>
<P>
   Among the concessions China has agreed to make to win admission
to the World Trade Organization, according to Barshefsky's office:
</P>
<P>
   - Tariffs on apples will be slashed to 10 percent, from a
current 30 percent. They have been as high as 80 percent five years
ago.
</P>
<P>
   - Boeing should be helped by China's agreement to end its
practice of requiring that U.S. companies doing business in China
share certain technology secrets and that they make investments in
Chinese industries.
</P>
<P>
   - Software companies, such as Microsoft and Nintendo, should be
helped by China's agreement to crack down on piracy and to allow
distribution of their products in China.

   WASHINGTON _ In a small but well-controlled study using tissue
from aborted fetuses to treat Parkinson's disease, a team of
researchers announced on Wednesday that they have relieved the
symptoms of some patients, a discovery that experts say suggests
that scientists are on the verge of being able to repair the
damaged brain.
</P>
<P>
   The study involved only 40 patients, just 20 of whom received
the transplants, and the improvements, while significant, were
dramatic in only a few. It remains to be seen how long they will
last. Those who benefited were better able to move and experienced
less stiffness before taking their daily medication. Some were able
to switch to less potent drugs.
</P>
<P>
   But the findings are tentative. And the experiment, the first of
its kind, is certain to inflame a debate that has divided abortion
rights advocates and opponents for more than a decade: the
questions of whether fetal tissue should be used in medical
research, and whether taxpayers should pay for it.
</P>
<P>
   For reasons the researchers do not quite understand, they saw
the best results in the nine transplant patients who were younger
than 60; older patients, who account for the majority of those with
Parkinson's, were not helped overall. Some got better but some got
worse. The researchers said there was no way to predict who would
benefit.
</P>
<P>
   But despite the small size of the study and its mixed results,
experts said it offered a tantalizing hint that the transplants may
someday work. It found that the fetal cells took hold and
established new networks to produce a missing neurochemical,
dopamine, in the brains of two-thirds of all the transplant
recipients, regardless of their age.
</P>
<P>
   ``Ten or 15 years ago, people would have thought of this as
science fiction,'' said Dr. Gerald Fischbach, director of the
National Institute of Neurological Disorder and Stroke, which paid
for the study. Given other promising developments in Parkinson's
disease, including research involving electrical stimulation of the
brain, Fischbach predicted that ``within the next 10 years there
will be a much more rational and safe and effective means of
reversing the dopamine deficit.''
</P>
<P>
   Of the results announced on Wednesday, Fischbach said, ''I think
they are extremely promising. My view is that the surgery worked.
The cells took. They survived, they were manufacturing the
transmitter dopamine.''
</P>
<P>
   Others were not quite so enthusiastic. ``It's mixed,'' said Dr.
J. William Langston, president of the Parkinson's Institute, a
nonprofit research organization in Sunnyvale, Calif. ``I'm
disappointed that the results were not more dramatic. On the other
hand, they do show that this seems to be feasible. I think it is a
very important first step.''
</P>
<P>
   The four-year study, which the government said cost $5.7
million, was led by Dr. Curt Freed of the University of Colorado in
Denver and Dr. Stanley Fahn of Columbia Presbyterian Center in
Manhattan. They announced their findings at a conference of the
American Academy of Neurology in Toronto, 11 years after President
Reagan first banned taxpayer support for such experiments and six
years after President Clinton lifted that ban.
</P>
<P>
   The results have not yet been published in a peer-reviewed
scientific journal, and in interviews, Freed and Fahn were cautious
about their results. They emphasized that questions about the
proper dose of cells, and why some patients did better than others,
must be be answered before fetal cell transplants can might be put
into widespread use.
</P>
<P>
   ``We need to reduce the variability of the transplant
response,'' Freed said, ``namely to know predictably how many cells
will survive following transplant and who is the best candidate for
a transplant.''
</P>
<P>
   More than one million Americans suffer from Parkinson's Disease,
a degenerative neurological condition that slowly strips patients
of control over their own muscles. There is no cure; although the
disease can be treated with medication, primarily the drug
leva-dopa, it eventually stops working. Patients with advanced
cases often lose their ability to walk and speak.
</P>
<P>
   For years, Parkinson's patients have watched, frustrated, as
their symptoms have worsened while the fetal cell research became
caught up in abortion politics. In 1988, Freed began operating on
patients with private money, and he continues to to so, he said, in
an effort to refine his technique. The operations cost about
$35,000 apiece; some have been paid for by patients, some by a
Denver philanthropist.
</P>
<P>
   But there were difficulties. The fetal tissue is hard to obtain,
a problem that might prevent the procedure from being used widely.
And until he got government support, Freed said, he was prevented
from conducting ``a truly high quality study.''
</P>
<P>
   In 1993, when Clinton lifted the funding ban, he teamed up with
Fahn to submit a grant application. The grant was approved the
following year, as was one for another team, led by Dr. C. Warren
Olanow of the Mt. Sinai School of Medicine in New York. Olanow said
he will report his results in two years.
</P>
<P>
   The experiments are controversial on two fronts. Not only have
they aroused the ire of abortion opponents, they have drawn
criticism from ethicists who objected to their placebo-controlled
design.
</P>
<P>
   In the Freed-Fahn study, each patient underwent neurosurgery:
four tiny holes, drilled through the wrinkle lines above the
eyebrows into the skull, to clear a pathway to the brain. But only
half received injections of dopamine-producing cells into the
putamen, the region of the brain that controls movement.

 &HT;    Retracing the path to savagery
 &HT;    By Richard Matthews
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Nothing written here should be considered in any way
an excuse for what happened in Littleton, Colo., Tuesday afternoon.
It's not an attempt to justify an unforgivable horror, not an
effort to ``blame the victims'' for the unconscionable violence
committed upon them.
</P>
<P>
   It is merely a suggestion that we take a closer look at the
lives our children lead, the values they hold dear among themselves
(regardless of what parents teach them) and, most important, the
resulting way they treat each other. Here, perhaps, may lie one
tiny piece of the near-impossible task of figuring out how
Columbine High School could have become a killing field.
</P>
<P>
   Start with an unfortunate but unavoidable admission: No one is
more naturally and comfortably cruel to others than children. From
the 3-year-old who snatches a toy from his little sister's hands to
the 16-year-old who calls a classmate ``fatso,'' the urge to
selfishness and meanness comes as naturally as breathing.
</P>
<P>
   For teens, that urge is compounded by the newer and more
powerful need to forge an independent identity, and to have it
accepted by others. The surest way to confirm that acceptance is to
join in the rejection of those who don't fit in. That's why a high
school is a kind of social battlefield _ and a peculiar one, on
which no victory is ever final. The winners must never cease
defeating the losers, over and over, day after day.
</P>
<P>
   This isn't new. We didn't have the word ``nerd'' when I was in
school, but we had nerds, and I was one of them. Life was rarely
fun for the bookish, the plump, the ugly and the ungainly. Phys Ed
class was a particular torture. Nearly every day the bigger guys,
especially the jocks, found an opportunity to push us down into the
sandspurs when the coach wasn't looking, just so they could laugh
about it. They proved their ``superiority'' beyond doubt, but
always seemed to need to demonstrate it time and again.
</P>
<P>
   Even those who weren't into pushing and shoving found myriad
ways to remind the undesirables that they were undesired _ omitting
them from club activities, ignoring their efforts to join a
conversation, laughing none too secretly about their appearance or
their lack of style and grace. No one who was ``out'' ever had to
wonder about his or her standing in the social order.
</P>
<P>
   None of us was happy about all that, but of course few of us
ever felt moved to do anything about it. We simply suffered in
silence, and dreamed of a day when we would find some kind of niche
where we would be accepted, or at least respected. Most kids in
that situation today no doubt do the same thing. A few, however,
take more drastic measures _ measures that we never dreamed of in
our simpler time.
</P>
<P>
   The two teens who killed and wounded dozens of their classmates
in Littleton this week were described as ``nerds, geeks and dweebs
trying to find someplace to fit in.'' Clearly they were not highly
regarded. From all accounts, they brought on much of the scorn
themselves, at least in their later teen years, but one has to
wonder if something happened earlier to help send them down that
path.
</P>
<P>
   More important, one has to wonder if there is anything we can
say to our children about their regard, or disregard, for the
feelings of those who aren't among the popular, the beautiful, the
athletic elite. If that could change, even a little, could we
lessen by the tiniest amount the likelihood that we'll be seeing
this same mind-numbing story on the news in the next months or
years?

BOEING WINS CONTRACT TO CONVERT CRUISE MISSILES 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By JAMES WALLACE  
 c.1999 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEATTLE _ With its inventory of air-launched cruise missiles
running short because of the war in Yugoslavia, the U.S. Air Force
on Wednesday The Boeing Co. a $41.3 million contract to convert 95
nuclear versions to carry conventional warheads.
</P>
<P>
   The Air Force has fewer than 100 operational missiles left in
its inventory, having fired more than 60 in the NATO air war
against Yugoslavia. The missiles are launched from B-52s.
</P>
<P>
   The conversion work would be done at Boeing's cruise missile
plant in St. Charles, Mo., and the first of the converted missiles
delivered to the Air Force late this year.
</P>
<P>
   But some members of Congress are urging Defense Secretary
William Cohen to place a new cruise missile order with Boeing,
which would mean restarting the company's long-dormant production
line.
</P>
<P>
   ``We believe the dwindling cruise missile inventory is one of
our most urgent national security issues and requires the
president's and your immediate attention,'' 19 House Republicans
said in a recent letter to Cohen.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. Rep. Norm Dicks, D-Wash., said Wednesday in an interview
that he would support restarting production of Boeing's
air-launched cruise missile, provided it was cost effective to do
so, could be done quickly and if the Air Force agreed.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we run out, we don't have a weapon to launch from our
B-52s,'' said Dicks, one of the more knowledgable members of
Congress on defense issues.
</P>
<P>
   The air-launched cruise missile has been one of the military's
favorite weapons in recent years. It was used extensively in Desert
Storm and more recently in Desert Fox, when the U.S. and Britain
launched sustained air strikes against Iraq.
</P>
<P>
   In the past five years, about 250 of the converted missiles have
been launched from B-52s. Fewer than 250 nuclear ones remain that
can be converted to carry conventional warheads.
</P>
<P>
   The converted missiles carry 2,000-pound warheads and have a
range of more than 600 miles. The conversions cost about $400,000
each, compared with about $1.5 million for a new missile.
</P>
<P>
   Boeing stands to make a lot more money if it built new missiles
from scratch.
</P>
<P>
   The Washington Post last Saturday reported that the letter sent
to Cohen by the 19 House Republicans was circulated to House
members with a cover memo from Boeing's chief Washington, D.C.
lobbyist.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is an extremely important issue to the Air Force, Navy
and Boeing in light of current world events and the limited number
of missiles remaining in inventory,'' the Boeing cover memo said,
according to the Post story.
</P>
<P>
   The lawmakers who sent the letter want the United States to
restart production of not only Boeing's air-launched cruise missile
but Raytheon's Tomahawk cruise missile.
</P>
<P>
   But the Navy does not favor additional production of the
Tomahawk. Instead, it wants limited funds to go toward the newer
Tactical Tomahawk, which is now in development.
</P>
<P>
   Dicks said Wednesday he has not yet been briefed by the Air
Force on the possibility of restarting production of the Boeing
missile.
</P>
<P>
   Restarting production of the air-launched cruise missile would
only be an interim solution to the missile shortage. The Air Force
plans to replace Boeing's air-launched cruise missiles with an
advanced Joint Air-to-Surface Standoff Munition. Lockheed Martin
won the contract over Boeing last year to supply the Air Force with
2,400 of the missiles, beginning in 2002.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Boeing will continue to convert the old nuclear
missiles.
</P>
<P>
   Boeing began production of the nuclear version in the 1970s at
the height of the Cold War. The first were converted to carry
conventional warheads in 1986. Boeing has subsequently received
several contracts for more conversions. The company delivered the
last batch of converted missiles to the Air Force in 1997.

REPORT WARNS OF BIG GAINS TO CHINESE FROM SPYING 
</HEADLINE>
  (js) 
 By JEFF GERTH   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ China is likely to use stolen advanced American
nuclear weapons secrets to upgrade its weapons within years, not
decades, a senior intelligence official said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   So far Beijing has not deployed nuclear weapons utilizing stolen
American technology, U.S. officials say. But the official,
discussing a new intelligence assessment, told reporters that
stolen nuclear secrets probably accelerated China's future weapons
programs.
</P>
<P>
   The study, done by intelligence officials throughout the
government, was coordinated by Robert Walpole, the national
intelligence officer for strategic and nuclear programs for the
government's National Intelligence Council.
</P>
<P>
   It examined the evidence that China acquired American nuclear
weapons information and it estimated what that has meant for the
development of China's weapons programs. An outside panel reviewed
and concurred with the assessment.
</P>
<P>
   China is developing a lighter, more mobile nuclear force but
does not have anywhere near the same number of nuclear weapons as
the United States or Russia. Chinese officials have consistently
denied that China stole American nuclear secrets.
</P>
<P>
   A one-page unclassified version of the assessment was released
at the briefing. It made these points:
</P>
<P>
   ``China obtained by espionage classified U.S. nuclear weapons
information that probably accelerated its program to develop future
nuclear weapons,'' by enabling Beijing to focus on more productive
avenues and ``avoid less promising approaches.''
</P>
<P>
   ``China obtained at least basic design information on several
modern U.S. nuclear re-entry vehicles, including the Trident II
(W-88),'' as well as information on ``a variety of U.S. weapon
design concepts and weaponization features, including those of the
neutron bomb.''
</P>
<P>
   The unclassified assessment lacks details and is filled with
conditional phrases and generalities. A more detailed, secret
version of the report was presented Wednesday to congressional and
executive branch officials by George J. Tenet, the director of
Central Intelligence, and Walpole.
</P>
<P>
   The public assessment does not address whether China's legal and
illegal acquisition of American nuclear weapons information
affected American national security.
</P>
<P>
   The study was done at the request of a select congressional
committee that found last year that national security had been
harmed as a result of China's 20-year pattern of acquiring American
technology, including nuclear design secrets stolen from American
weapons laboratories.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   The lengthy secret report utilized earlier assessments by the
CIA and the Energy Department that came to similar conclusions that
China had stolen W-88 design secrets, which enable nuclear weapons
to be miniaturized, officials said. But in 1997, on the eve of a
Washington summit meeting at which Chinese-American relations were
elevated to a ``strategic partnership,'' White House officials
magnified the differences between the CIA and the Energy Department
reports to cast doubt on the Energy Department's troubling
conclusions, officials said.
</P>
<P>
   According to the latest assessment, China's quest for smaller
nuclear weapons probably reflects its desire for a more mobile
force that can survive and retaliate against a nuclear attack by
the United States or Russia, or a ``second-strike capability.''
</P>
<P>
   China's aggressive and successful efforts to acquire U.S.
secrets, both through espionage and open methods like scientific
exchanges, as well as China's indigenous development, have ``made
an important contribution to the Chinese objective to maintain a
second-strike capability and provided useful information for future
designs,'' the assessment said. The assessment did not calculate
the relative importance of each Chinese acquisition method.
</P>
<P>
   China's weapons program is still deficient in significant ways
and the Chinese are ``almost certainly'' now using spying and other
methods ``to address deficiencies,'' the assessment added.
</P>
<P>
   The assessment also suggested that China might be more inclined
to share older nuclear technology with countries like Iran or
Pakistan _ a source of continuing concern for the United States _
as a result of its theft of more modern American technology.
</P>
<P>
   But, the assessment said, ``we do not know if U.S. classified
nuclear information acquired by the Chinese has been passed to
other countries.''
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton was briefed on the assessment Wednesday
afternoon and then issued a statement saying he had asked the
National Counterintelligence Board to assess the potential
vulnerabilities at other nuclear weapons facilities besides the

   LITTLETON, Colo. _ As parents waited in agony nearby and police
squads searched for explosive booby traps inside, authorities
carefully made their way through Columbine High School on Wednesday
where they found the bodies at least 15 people killed by gunshots
or homemade pipe bombs in a massacre Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Among the dead were the two members of the junior class who are
believed to have unleashed the carnage before turning their guns on
themselves.
</P>
<P>
   Twelve of the dead, including both suspects, were found in the
school's library, said the Jefferson County sheriff, John Stone,
who added that there were so many weapons and explosive devices _
including 30 bombs, a semi-automatic rifle and pistol and two
shotguns _ that investigators were still unsure how they got it all
inside the school. They may have hidden it during several trips or
they may have had help, Stone said.
</P>
<P>
   But an even more unfathomable set of questions surrounded the
motivations of the two suspects, 18-year-old Eric David Harris and
Dylan Bennett Klebold, 17, who were described by many students
Wednesday as members of a self-styled group of loners and outcasts
who called themselves the ``Trenchcoat Mafia'' after the long black
coats they wore and shared a fascination with violent video games
and a antipathy toward the more popular students who they referred
to as ``jocks.''
</P>
<P>
   Both Harris and Klebold were arrested last year for breaking
into a car, and parents of another student at the school said that
they had complained to authorities last year about death threats
made by Harris against their son. Nonetheless, school authorities
and many students insisted Wednesday that they never seriously
considered either young man to be inclined toward the horrific
violence let loose here Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   The incident set off a national bout of soul-searching and
debates over whether the killings were spurred by easy access to
guns or by the violent images on television and in video games to
which America's children are routinely exposed.
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton said in Washington that ``all of us are
struggling to understand exactly what happened and why.''
</P>
<P>
   The shootings also had immediate political reverberations as
well: In at least three states, including Colorado, sponsors of
legislation expanding the rights to carry guns withdrew those
measures Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Authorities were still so concerned about the possibility of
more danger that just two bodies had been removed from the school
by Wednesday evening, and others were so unrecognizable that
parents were asked to bring dental records of their missing
children to the school.
</P>
<P>
   It is unclear whether the death toll, which represents the
largest school massacre in the country's history, but was also a
downward revision from the possible 23 deaths that the authorities
had said on Tuesday, will rise again as the search inside the
school continues.
</P>
<P>
   Eleven of the dead are male, including at least one teacher and
one black student at whom the killers had shouted racial
obscenities before shooting him in the head.
</P>
<P>
   Sixteen people are still hospitalized, 11 of them in serious or
critical condition, according to a spokesman for the sheriff's
office.
</P>
<P>
   Students in the school at the time of the attack Wednesday
described a series of gunshots and thunderous explosions followed
by frantic requests from some teachers that they get themselves
into classrooms and barricade the door. Within minutes, as news of
the attack spread outside, many students with pagers found them
going off incessantly, as parents, siblings and friends sought to
reach out in a frenetic bid for news of their safety.
</P>
<P>
   Other students who carry cellular phones started using them to
call outside, even as the gunshots continued down the hall,
primarily in the library.
</P>
<P>
   ``One kid called his mother right away and he just said, `Mom, I
hope we're going to be okay, but I love you, Mom, and if anything
happens I just want you to know that I really love you, even if I
didn't always act like it,''' said 17-year-old Craig Nason, a
junior at Columbine, who was herded with 60 other students into the
glee-club room, where the boys moved two desks and a filing cabinet
to create a barricade.
</P>
<P>
   Another student in the library managed to scribble a cardboard
sign that said ``Help me _ I'm bleeding to death'' which he placed
in the window where police officers could see it, said Sgt. George
Hinkle, a leader of the Lakewood, Colo., police department's SWAT
team. That student was now believed to be among the dead, he said.
</P>
<P>
   All day long, under sunny skies that turned slate grey with an
approaching storm Wednesday afternoon, students gathered near the
high school for any news about friends still officially listed as
missing. Many were crying or clutching flowers that they brought to
a makeshift memorial.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can't even imagine walking into that school right now,''
said 17-year-old Dara Ferguson, a junior, who had three friends
whom she feared were dead. ``I don't think I ever want to set foot
in there again.''
</P>
<P>
   Officials with the Jefferson County School District said that
the building, with hundreds of bullet holes and several inches of
water that came from sprinklers that went off after the bombs did,
would remain closed for the rest of the school year.
</P>
<P>
   As the authorities sought to identify the dead and piece
together what happened and what motivated the young men, some
educators wasted no time in tracing the incident to cultural
factors.
</P>
<P>
   ``Too many children grow up surrounded by images and violence
and hate on video games, in music lyrics, on television and on the
Internet,'' said Sandra Feldman, president of the American
Federation of Teachers.
</P>
<P>
   ``Children don't create those images, adults do,'' she said.
``In the coming days, we need to take a good hard look at what our
culture is celebrating, and what our country must change.

APACHE HELICOPTERS ARRIVE IN ALBANIA 
</HEADLINE>
  (js) 
 By JOHN KIFNER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   TIRANA, Albania _ The first of the long-awaited American Apache
attack helicopters touched down here Wednesday evening in a frenzy
of media attention and Army vows to transform NATO's thus far
ineffective campaign to halt Serbian attacks against Albanians in
Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   Six of the helicopters, which won a reputation as tank-busters
in the Persian Gulf War, buzzed in from the west through gray
cloudy skies at 6:15 Wednesday night after a flight from allied
bases in Italy. They were accompanied by seven Black Hawk
helicopters, two of them modified for medical evacuations and
marked with red crosses, and two huge Chinook transport
helicopters.
</P>
<P>
   The full contingent of Apaches is expected to number 24, and
will normally operate in flights of six. The NATO commander, Gen.
Wesley K. Clark, had been seeking the Apaches since the bombing
began on March 24, and is understood to have requested more, but
their deployment has lagged for a number of reasons, including bad
weather.
</P>
<P>
   The Apaches' actual engagement in combat over Kosovo _ where
they are expected to attack Serbian tanks, hidden light-artillery
positions and small troop clusters, which have proved elusive to
high-altitude bombers _ will take still more time, military
officials indicated, perhaps a week or so.
</P>
<P>
   The Apaches have dropped into a logistical nightmare. Albania is
the poorest country in Europe, with unpaved roads in the center of
its capital. For years Rina Airport here was used mostly by the
hard-line Communist dictator, Enver Hoxha, to greet a steadily
dwindling number of foreign visitors.
</P>
<P>
   The area from which the allied forces are operating relief
flights, down the runway from the main terminal, is reachable only
by a dirt road snaking around the airport's edge past tattered
snack kiosks, half-built houses and dozing sheep. The road has now
turned into mud, barely two vehicles wide and rapidly crumbling at
the edges. A big American military truck fell almost on its side
into a ditch near the gate Wednesday afternoon.
</P>
<P>
   And that is the developed part. The U.S. Army camp is in
something close to a mud pit some distance from the runway.
Vehicles that have been here two days are covered in filth, with
fresh mud up to their door handles. Engineers are building a road
to the Army tents but it is difficult right now for the officers
even to make their way to the main base, where the Air Force is
coordinating about 300 flights a day.
</P>
<P>
   How _ and whether _ the Apaches will operate in this
environment, along with the hundreds of relief flights, is unclear.
The allied forces are beginning an expanded program, in cooperation
with the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees, to evacuate
by helicopter the sickest and weakest of the 100,000 refugees still
stuck in the remote mountainous northern border region of Kukes,
further increasing the pressure on the forces here.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   One possibility is that the Apaches may be moved to an old
military airport further north, but American military officials
would give no details of the deployment.
</P>
<P>
   The arrival of the Apaches, however, has become such a
ballyhooed event that the rustic airport swarmed with more than a
hundred journalists, mostly television crews, seeking to record the
arrival. Army public affairs officers struggled to contain the
unruly crowd within an area where they would not be hit by flying
rocks when the helicopters landed.
</P>
<P>
   The Army also brought forth a qualified Apache pilot _ a tall,
lean, 29-year-old captain, Mark Arden _ to speak to journalists,
though it turned out that Arden would not actually be flying
because he is the administrative officer of the 11th Attack
Aviation Regiment, which is based in Germany and is a main
component of the Apache group. The helicopters were not a part of
NATO's original plan and the force here has been cobbled together
from a number of units, including paratroopers from the 82nd
Airborne Division who are to guard the helicopters _ hundreds of
miles and several mountain ranges away from the front lines.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Serbs have been successful in defeating women and children
that are unarmed,'' Arden said, hooking his black-gloved thumbs in
his ammunition belt. ``The tables are about to be turned,'' he
added, because his comrades ``are fired up.''
</P>
<P>
   ``They know they are at the tip of the spear of the entire
United States Army.''

   KUKES, Albania _ After five mornings of chilling rain left his
children coughing and wheezing, Ilir Januzi could take no more.
Just after daybreak Wednesday, he took his wife and children _
including an 8-month-old son _ from the old car that had been their
only shelter and boarded a bus for Vlora, 220 miles south of here.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just have to get out of here,'' Januzi said as he waited for
the bus to depart. ``This is no man's land.''
</P>
<P>
   In the last few days, a combination of bad weather and appalling
sanitary conditions have pushed more than 16,000 Kosovar refugees
to leave this no man's land of garbage and mud, and head once more
for unknown places they hope will be better than the places they
left.
</P>
<P>
   But even so, many of the buses that are to carry refugees to
less crowded and more secure encampments elsewhere sit half empty.
Their drivers are not allowed to leave until the buses are full, so
they end up sleeping one, two, three nights in their buses, waiting
for enough refugees to make up their mind to leave.
</P>
<P>
   U.N. officials say the situation is turning critical, with the
chance of an epidemic rising along with the increasing danger of a
Serbian attack here _ only 10 miles from the border _ as tensions
between Albania and Yugoslavia worsen.
</P>
<P>
   There has been shelling nearby, but the greatest danger for
refugees so far has been illness. Already, 59 refugees have died in
the camps since the beginning of the crisis, according to U.N.
figures. While that rate is not considered excessive, with tens of
thousands of physically weakened refugees passing through here, it
has caused concern.
</P>
<P>
   The most crippling illnesses have been respiratory infections
caused by the dampness and the cold, said Muhammed Dualeh, senior
public health officer for the U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees,
which coordinates care for the Kosovo refugees.
</P>
<P>
   Another potentially lethal problem is posed by the five cases of
bloody diarrhea recently reported in the camps here in Kukes, a
small city in northeastern Albania that has been swamped by a flood
of refugees.
</P>
<P>
   Dualeh said the cases have been isolated, so far. And the cold
weather has actually helped contain the danger. If temperatures
rise and the flies that carry the disease begin to hatch, an
epidemic could easily arise in the unsanitary conditions.
</P>
<P>
   Although the flow of refugees has stopped temporarily, the
numbers here still are so great that the solution to one problem
can sometimes be the cause of yet another.
</P>
<P>
   Food is available now, but garbage collection has become an
enormous concern. With fresh bread delivered every day, stale
pieces are thrown in heaps, where they mold or turn to stinking
mush. Along with empty sardine tins and used disposable diapers
that are now distributed by some agencies, the aid has added
substantially to the waste.
</P>
<P>
   It accumulates everywhere, even along the stairs to the single
mosque in Kukes, a place traditionally swept spotless every day.
</P>
<P>
   Nicholas Morris, special envoy to Albania for the U.N. High
Commissioner for Refugees, said that despite the filth and the
cold, there appears to be growing reluctance to leave on the part
of a great number of the 100,000 refugees estimated to be here.
</P>
<P>
   ``People want to stay here because they don't know where their
family and relatives are,'' he said. They also are reluctant to
leave behind the tractors on which many came.
</P>
<P>
   One proposal being considered would set aside one day a week to
allow the refugees to take their slow-moving tractors on the only
road that leads from here to warmer areas in the south. Currently
refugees are not permitted to take tractors on that road.
</P>
<P>
   The organizations providing the refugees with services are
encouraging people to leave now. Pamphlets already are being
distributed urging people to go, and soon there will be daily radio
broadcasts detailing the advantages of alternative locations. Many
refugees brought their own transistor radios, and a foundation will
soon begin to give away hand-cranked radios.
</P>
<P>
   NATO has also agreed to provide helicopters that can ferry the
weakest refugees to less congested southern towns, where they will
be able to stay with willing Albanian families. The first three
helicopters transported more than 110 people Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   But most refugees, if they leave, still go by bus. Every
morning, around dawn, a fleet of battered private buses from
throughout the region line up in the largest plaza. With the
destination marked on each bus, a refugee like Zenel Josha has to
decide only where he wants to go. The ride is paid for by the
Albanian government.
</P>
<P>
   ``Not one of us has had a bath in three weeks and we are ashamed
of how we look,'' said Josha, a window maker from Mitrovica, in the
industrialized northern part of Kosovo. He left there on a tractor
with his brother, Naim, and their families _ 10 people in all.
</P>
<P>
   Josha had decided to board the bus to Vlora after the rains
soaked the few things he still owned, and his children began to
sniffle.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've heard they are going to find a place for us with an
Albanian family,'' Josha said, holding one of his children on his
lap to keep her warm as they waited for the bus to fill so it could
leave. ``But no matter what it is like there, it has to be better
than here.''

ANALYSTS PREDICT IMPROVED EARNINGS AT K-SWISS

<TEXT>
<P>
   WESTLAKE VILLAGE, Calif. -- Athletic shoe maker K-Swiss Inc. is
expected to race far past last year's finishing line when it
releases its first-quarter results today.
</P>
<P>
   According to a First Call survey of four analysts, K-Swiss
should earn about 75 cents per share for the quarter ended March
31, more than double the 31 cents the company earned in the
comparable year-ago period. The analysts' estimates ranged from 74
cents to 77 cents.
</P>
<P>
   The analysts also expect the company to end the year with
earnings of about $1.84 per share, or 67 percent up from last
year's $1.10 per share. Estimates ranged from $1.64 to $2.03.
</P>
<P>
   All numbers have been adjusted to take into account the
two-for-one stock split that took effect March 29, according to
Chuck Hill, director of research for First Call.
</P>
<P>
   Jeff van Sinderen, a research analyst for B. Riley in Santa
Monica, expects K-Swiss to earn 74 cents per share, and thinks
second-quarter earnings will be strong as well.
</P>
<P>
   Come back-to-school time, however, the company could become a
victim of its own success as rival companies release knockoffs of
K-Swiss's popular all-white sneaker style.
</P>
<P>
   ``The biggest question I have is, are some of the retailers
going to decide to try the knockoffs because of the lower price
point?'' van Sinderen said. ``Aside from that, I think this quarter
there will be strong results, and next quarter will also be
strong.''
</P>
<P>
   The company's stock went on a wild ride between Feb. 8 and March
17, nearly doubling to a split-adjusted high of $34.125 on the
strength of its year-end earnings and anticipation of its stock
split before steadily declining to the low $20s.
</P>
<P>
   On Wednesday, K-Swiss shares closed the day at $34.875, up
$2.75.

 WASHINGTON: controls movement.  
<TEXT>
<P>
   In the others, the surgery was a sham, designed to test the
placebo response, in which patients get better simply by thinking
they have been treated. And indeed, the experiment found a
particularly powerful placebo effect in at least three patients in
the control group.
</P>
<P>
   ``They got this placebo surgery and immediately they felt
better,'' Fahn said. ``And that feeling of getting better lasted an
entire year.'' Others also responded to the placebo, he said, but
for not quite as long.
</P>
<P>
   Among them was Lynda McKenzie, a 46-year-old former crafts shop
owner from outside Toronto who said she was convinced she had had
the real surgery for three or four months after her sham operation.
``I felt good afterwards,'' she said. ``I was sure I had it.''
</P>
<P>
   But the study also left the family of at least one participant
feeling desperate, and betrayed. Jack Celnik, a 63-year-old retired
nuclear physicist from Lakewood, N.J., was among those in the
placebo group. Each was monitored for 13 months and was to be
offered the real transplant after that. But given the study's
results, doctors are advising Celnik not to have the surgery.
</P>
<P>
   ``This was like his last hope and his last chance,'' said his
daughter, Gitty Charnas, in a telephone interview on Wednesday. She
spoke at a rapid clip, the exasperation and anger evident in her
voice. ``They used him.''
</P>
<P>
   Freed said that Celnik's case poses a quandary: Is it proper to
perform the surgery, which poses a small risk of hemorrhage and
stroke, on a patient who is unlikely to benefit from it, even if
that patient demands it?
</P>
<P>
   ``We pointedly have not operated on any older patients after we
became aware of this result,'' he said. ``We are going to have to
have a long talk with the people at NIH, as well as the patients.''
</P>
<P>
   Nineteen women and 21 men enrolled in the trial. The
participants had suffered from Parkinson's Disease for an average
of 13.8 years when the surgeries began in May 1995. Half the
participants were older than 60, but none was older than 75.
</P>
<P>
   As measured on a standard scale that rates Parkinson's symptoms,
the younger patients who received the transplants demonstrated a 30
percent improvement, Fahn said. They did not relieve the patient's
tremors, nor ease the ''freezing phenomenon,'' in which patients
freeze up mid-stride. But they lessened slowness and stiffness when
patients were off their medicine.

   Two patients, both older than 60, died of circumstances
unrelated to their transplants, one of a heart attack and the other
in a car accident. In both cases, Freed said, autopsies showed
evidence of cell growth in their brains.

<P>
   NEW YORK _ The United States is offering to bring 20,000 Kosovar
refugees to the American mainland for temporary placement with
families, Vice President Al Gore announced Wednesday. The offer
represents a new policy, and formal abandonment of the
much-criticized earlier proposal to relocate thousands of the
refugees to the naval base at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba.
</P>
<P>
   ``We will accept, on the American mainland, up to 20,000 of the
hurting and homeless Kosovar refugees _ those with close family
ties in America and those who are vulnerable,'' Gore said in a
speech to about 200 community leaders on Ellis Island in a ceremony
commemorating the 50th anniversary of NATO. ``We will bring them
here until they are able to return home safely.''
</P>
<P>
   The refugees are to be screened from among the many thousands
who have fled Kosovo, and they will need to meet international
standards for refugees in order to come.
</P>
<P>
   Administration officials said they had no idea how many refugees
might want to come to the United States, but that they were
limiting the number to those who had family in the United States or
whose health was too fragile to withstand the difficulties of the
nomadic life many have now been forced to adopt. The United States
is home to numerous pockets of Albanian-Americans, including in New
York and Detroit.
</P>
<P>
   Gore said the refugees would not be granted political asylum.
``We anticipate their return to Kosovo,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The NATO allies, including the United States, first announced
plans two weeks ago to provide temporary homes for the refugees who
have been streaming out of Kosovo. So far, refugees have been
placed in 11 countries; Germany has accepted about 10,000.
</P>
<P>
   Macedonia has indicated to the United States that it is simply
out of space for accommodating any more refugees, one U.S. official
said.
</P>
<P>
   An administration official said that refugees could be
identified for placement early next week.
</P>
<P>
   But the Clinton administration's plan to send refugees to a vast
tent community at the naval station on Guantanamo Bay has fizzled,
with officials suspending a proposed airlift and offering to build
barracks in Albania instead. Many refugee agencies and Albanian
refugee families rejected the idea of being shipped so far from
their homeland, and to such an isolated spot.
</P>
<P>
   ``The decision to use Guantanamo was made when it looked like a
large group needed to be moved quickly and there was no time for
screening,'' an administration official said. The official said
that those circumstances no longer prevailed and that there would
be more time for screening and moving those who wanted to move.
</P>
<P>
   When the base was first selected as a location, administration
officials indicated it was also chosen to eliminate the possibility
that some of the refugees would claim political asylum in the
United States. Under federal immigration law, refugees can claim
asylum only once they reach American soil.
</P>
<P>
   More important, as recently as last week, President Clinton,
among others, said that moving the refugees out of the Balkan
region could appear to hand a victory to President Slobodan
Milosevic of Yugoslavia and to his policy of ``ethnic cleansing,''
and that it would therefore not be in NATO's interest.
</P>
<P>
   While in the Detroit area last week, Clinton met privately with
seven Albanian-Americans who have relatives in the war-torn region.
P.J. Crowley, a spokesman for the president, said Clinton agreed
with them that for the short term, it would be better to try to
help the refugees stay in the Balkans rather than move them to
Guantanamo Bay.
</P>
<P>
   Crowley said at the time that temporarily relocating some
refugees to Guantanamo ``remains an option,'' but for the moment,
such a mass movement would look like ``a propaganda victory'' for
Milosevic.
</P>
<P>
   Asked about some refugees' reluctance to leave the Balkan
region, Gore said, ``It is a balance. The vast and overwhelming
majority will remain right in the region prepared to return on
short notice. These too, the ones coming to the United States, will
also be prepared to return on short notice.''
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Lamar Smith, R-Texas, chairman of the House Judiciary
Committee's immigration panel, said that ``the administration's
decision to bring 20,000 Kosovar refugees to the United States is
the largest and most compelling evidence yet of a complete
breakdown of administration policy.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Where the goal was to halt Serb atrocities, we now have the
biggest refugee crisis in postwar history,'' Smith said. ``We are
now witnessing a stunning string of failures that continue to
multiply the miseries of the Kosovars.''

<P>
   BRUSSELS, Belgium _ Britain and France are pressing the United
States to seriously consider sending ground forces into Kosovo. But
as leaders of the NATO nations begin gathering here on the eve of
the alliance's 50th anniversary summit, their differences are so
pronounced that the matter has been left off the agenda.
</P>
<P>
   The Clinton administration seems to be extremely wary about
suggestions that ground troops might have to go into Kosovo. One
senior official said he worried about a situation in which NATO
troops found themselves mired in a guerrilla war with Serb
renegades.
</P>
<P>
   ``The problem is not fighting your way in; it is what happens
after you get there,'' the official said.
</P>
<P>
   Nonetheless, Washington signalled some flexibility on Wednesday
night, saying it favored a broad NATO review of options developed
last summer on the use of ground troops in Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   The behind-the-scenes debate broke out into the open this week
in a coordinated series of statements by Britain's prime minister,
defense minister and foreign minister.
</P>
<P>
   With four weeks of bombing attacks already behind them, they
argued that weeks, if not months, of sustained bombing might
sufficiently weaken the Serb military so that NATO ground forces
could move into Kosovo and establish order with limited
casualities. The scenario has been discussed so much in the
corridors of NATO headquarters here that it even has a name: ``a
semi-permissive environment.''
</P>
<P>
   The British proposal would be a major shift from the NATO's
current plan, which is to send in a peacekeeping force of 28,000
troops, but only if President Slobodan Milosevic withdraws his
forces from Kosovo and accepts a peace settlement that allows the
1.8 million ethnic Albanians to return to their shattered homes.
</P>
<P>
   As Robin Cook, Britain's foreign minister put it Tuesday in an
address to the House of Commons, it is possible to ``conceive of
circumstances in which it may be feasible to commit ground
troops.''
</P>
<P>
   The main condition would be the assurance that NATO's force were
not facing ``organized armed resistance.'' As British officials
tell it, Milosevic would not be given a ``veto'' over the
introduction of allied ground troops.
</P>
<P>
   The British are not alone in pressing for the possible
introduction of ground forces. President Jacques Chirac of France
said in a televised speech Wednesday night that the alliance should
apply ``additional means'' besides escalating the air war to stop
``massacres, rapes, burned villages, families separated and thrown
onto the roads.''
</P>
<P>
   French officials said Chirac's statement was an allusion to
ground forces, and that France's plan was to seek a U.N. Security
Council resolution mandating such a force.
</P>
<P>
   In Washington, the entire question of ground forces going into
potential combat in Kosovo has been highly sensitive. American
officials have sought to avoid public discussion of the matter.
Defense Secretary William Cohen suggested on Wednesday that the
matter of ground troops did not need to be decided because Gen.
Wesley K. Clark, the NATO commander, had not officially requested
authority to plan a military operation using combat forces.
</P>
<P>
   Left unstated was the fact that NATO's military commander was
not about to propose a major escalation in the fighting unless the
United States, the leader of the alliance, was behind it and was
ready to use its political influence to build support for a
decision to send in ground troops.
</P>
<P>
   But after saying for weeks that no such planning was necessary,
the White House said on Wednesday that it was time to study the
size and composition of the forces that would be needed.
</P>
<P>
   ``The U.S. would certainly support as a prudent measure any
updating of the assessments of the use of ground troops in a
permissive and non-permissive environment,'' the White House
official said on Wednesday evening. ``It would be irresponsible for
us not to periodically update our plans.''
</P>
<P>
   The allies were not the only ones the Clinton administration
appeared to have in mind. Sen. John McCain, R-Ariz., who is seeking
the Republican presidential nomination, has lambasted the Clinton
dministration for starting an air campaign against Yugoslavia
without a backup plan for combat troops.
</P>
<P>
   Certainly, all the allies agree the bombing needs to go on for a
long time. Clark has repeatedly argued that the bombing campaign
has to have time to do its work and that it is too early to say if
it will succeed.
</P>
<P>
   On Wednesday night, the 29th day of bombing, allied planes hit
the headquarters of Milosevic's party in Belgrade, a
glass-and-steel 23-story building that also housed three local
television and radio stations.
</P>
<P>
   Defense Minister George Robertson of Britain described the
building as ``one of the nerve centers of the machine which plans
the killing in Kosovo.''
</P>
<P>
   Nonetheless, Western diplomats say Clark has told allied leaders
that he cannot guarantee that bombing attacks alone will compel
Milosevic to withdraw Serbian troops from Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Despite this, NATO nations have yet to ask him to draw up a new
plan to send in combat troops, nor has he asked for the authority
to begin planning.
</P>
<P>
   The review of military options, which the Clinton administration
says it now supports, stops considerably short of that.
</P>
<P>
   Even if there was a plan, lengthy preparations would be needed
to assemble the force. Even then, no ground attack could be carried
out without the approval of the entire 19-member alliance.
</P>
<P>
   In the absence of an agreement, diplomats here initially sought
to paper over their differences. But lately, the British have
insisted that ground troops might be needed to bring the war to an
end.
</P>
<P>
   Toward that end, Prime Minister Tony Blair met with Clinton here
Wednesday night in an apparent effort to persuade him to do more to
actively prepare in case land forces were needed.
</P>
<P>
   Blair made the case for this after meeting at NATO headquarters
with l Clark on Tuesday. He drew a distinction between sending in
ground troops against tough Serb resistance and sending them in
after punishing NATO bombing had taken the fight out of them.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have always made clear the difficulties of putting in
ground forces as a land force invasion against undegraded organized
Serb resistence,'' Blair said. ``We have also equally made it clear
that the international military force is there to allow people to
go back to their homes.''
</P>
<P>
   Going in on the ground would mark a huge departure for NATO,
which has been as preoccupied with maintaining public support at
home for the military campaign as in taking the war to Serb forces.
</P>
<P>
   Chancellor Gerhard Schroder of Germany would probably be in
favor of sending ground troops to Kosovo, but one European official
sepculated that Foreign Minister Joschka Fischer's Greens Party
might break apart over the issue, collapsing the government.
</P>
<P>
   Canada would not oppose an alliance consensus, Prime Minister
Jean Chretien said in Montreal on Tuesday. ``If everyone is in
agreement, I will not be the only one disagreeing,'' Chretien said.
</P>
<P>
   The French position is less bold than it seems. French officials
say that France would be prepared to send in troops but only with a
mandate for such a force from the U.N. Security Council, which
would require persuading Russia not to use its veto power there.
</P>
<P>
   That would be a tall order since Moscow is adamantly opposed to
any force that does not have Milosevic's approval.
</P>
<P>
   NATO members will have ample opportunity to debate the issue at
the summit. Their foreign ministers and defense ministers will also
have separate meetings of their own on Friday.
</P>
<P>
   ``The issue of ground troops is not on the agenda in Washington,
but the leaders are certainly going to be talking about it, in
bilateral meetings, over dinner, informally,'' a high European
official of the alliance said.
</P>
<P>
   ``The British, the French and the Turks might all be willing to
go in with ground troops,'' he added. ``Others are more reticient.
But what do the Americans want?''
</P>
<P>
   The Clinton administration has been reluctant to take the lead
in thinking about a land operation.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is an American-led organization,'' the senior European
official said. ``If the Americans said we can't let Milosevic get
away with this, we've got to go in with ground troops, then each
country would have to consider the issue and make a decision. And
we could agree that only the countries that wanted to would
contribute.''

 &HT;    Parents say teens have seen too much misery
 &HT;    By Rachel Sauer

<TEXT>
<P>
   LITTLETON, Colo. _ They came in groups, pairs or eight at a
time, clutching bouquets of red roses or single tulips or sprays of
dandelions to leave at the bases of Clement Park trees transformed
to memorials.
</P>
<P>
   They came from all over, not just Littleton, eyes flooding and
breath hitching as they held each other in tight, desperate hugs,
as if by loosening their holds they might slip away forever.
</P>
<P>
   All day Wednesday, as flat gray clouds rolled in from the east
to settle menacingly against the stark Rocky Mountain foothills
that skirt Littleton, people came to Clement Park, a quarter mile
north of Columbine High School, to grieve and remember and ask an
overwhelming, bewildering question: Why?
</P>
<P>
   Teenagers and mothers and pastors and young children began
pouring onto the park around noon, and almost invariably they
asked, Why here? Why innocent kids? Why did this happen to us?
</P>
<P>
   Tuesday morning about 11:25, Eric Harris, 18, and Dylan Klebold,
17, both seniors at Columbine entered the school armed with two
sawed-off shotguns, a semiautomatic handgun and many homemade
bombs. They opened fire in the hallways and library, killing 12
students, one teacher and, according to District Attorney David
Thomas, themselves.
</P>
<P>
   Because they rigged an elaborate series of booby trap bombs
around the school _ Jefferson County Sheriff John Stone said SWAT
team members found 30 bombs in and around the building _ law
enforcement officers had to do extensive sweeps of the building
before the bodies of the slain students and teacher could be
removed.
</P>
<P>
   So people stood on the trampled grass behind the police
barricades and in the parking lot, staring silently at the signs,
flowers, stuffed animals and candles surrounding two trees in a
rapidly growing expanse.
</P>
<P>
   They looked at the memorials and cried the tears they thought
they didn't have left, holding onto each other tight.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've got two little kids at home,'' said John Williams, an
assistant manager of a Littleton movie theater. ``I keep thinking
about what I'd do if I got a call from the school saying my
children had been killed. I don't think I could handle it.''
</P>
<P>
   But Wednesday, people had no choice but to handle it. Teenagers,
mostly unaccustomed to feeling grief, stood in tight circles for
comfort and warmth as a sad April wind sighed all around them and
made the flags at half-staff fly out straight.
</P>
<P>
   ``Why?'' asked a Columbine sophomore, clutching her friend's arm
as they stood near a memorial tree. ``Oh, God. God. Why did this
have to happen?''
</P>
<P>
   Nobody knew. Zondra Lapp came to the park at 5:30 a.m. Wednesday
with her son, Joshua, 16, who was in the library when the first
shots were fired. He escaped unharmed and went a friend's house,
but Zondra spent a panicked Tuesday afternoon at Leawood Elementary
School before she was reunited with Joshua at 5:30 p.m.
</P>
<P>
   As Joshua talked to reporters, Zondra looked at him and started
to cry. ``He saw too much. He's only 16 and he saw too much,'' she
said as she stood shivering in the predawn chill.
</P>
<P>
   Jim Woods didn't let his son, Justin, 15, out of his sight as
Justin waited to talk to reporters. Jim occasionally kissed
Justin's cheek or patted his shoulder or put his arm around him.
Justin was playing soccer when the shooting started and ran to a
house near the school to call his parents.
</P>
<P>
   The Woodses spent the entire evening talking and praying and
crying. ``We didn't go to bed last night,'' said Justin's mother,
Lisa. ``I just can't stop thinking about what Justin will see when
he goes in his room, turns on the light, if he'll see the bodies of
the students who were shot. He's going to have to live with that
even though we'll go to counseling as a family.''
</P>
<P>
   As the sun rose and thin light filtered through the clouds, more
people came to the park to brave the ravenous hordes of reporters
and looked to each other for comfort.
</P>
<P>
   ``The people in this town have been amazing,'' said Peggy Beck,
a registered nurse at Centura Littleton Adventist Hospital, to
which 10 injured students were taken. ``It sounds cliche, but
people have really pulled together.''
</P>
<P>
   She said a restaurant sent over pizza and many people called to
check on the welfare of the students.
</P>
<P>
   All day Wednesday, people brought food for the Jefferson County
Sheriff's Department deputies guarding the streets to prevent
people from going to the school. By afternoon, the deputy at the
intersection of Bowles and Pierce had a tidy pile that included
McDonald's cheeseburgers, a muffin, a case of bottled water and
chocolate-chip cookies.
</P>
<P>
   Mostly, though, people from around the metro-Denver area came to
Clement Park to stand in support of those who grieved. They brought
butterfly balloons and hopes to remind people how beauty can rise
from ugliness.
</P>
<P>
   They formed spontaneous prayer circles and sang gospels songs
with upraised arms and fervently closed eyes.
</P>
<P>
   There was nothing they could say, so they stood and sat and
kneeled _ pastors from Denver, students from Arvada, grandmothers
from Wheat Ridge - and vowed they would get through the tragedy
together and never let it happen again.

   LITTLETON, Colo. - The two Columbine High School seniors worked
last Friday making pizzas. On Monday, they went bowling. And on
Tuesday, it seems, they committed mass murder.
</P>
<P>
   Nobody had taken Eric Harris and Dylan Klebold seriously.
</P>
<P>
   They wore long black coats and hung with a clique of
middle-class suburban teen-agers that called itself the trench-coat
mafia. They lived with the familiar trappings of suburban comfort
in a town with glorious views of the Rocky Mountain foothills.
</P>
<P>
   They struck sullen, brooding poses. They talked about Hitler and
wore clothes with German insignia. In February they had completed a
``diversion program'' for first-time juvenile offenders, after
their arrest for breaking into a van and stealing electronic
equipment, according to the Jefferson County district attorney.
</P>
<P>
   The other students say they wanted to portray themselves as
rebels or villains. But mostly they were viewed as losers. ``They
were just a little weird,'' said Dara Ferguson, a 17-year-old
junior and a cheerleader. ``They wanted to be different.''
</P>
<P>
   Late Tuesday night, after the mass shooting at the high school,
agents of the Bureau of Alcohol, Firearms and Tobacco, acting on a
warrant, searched the Harris house at the end of a cul-de-sac in
Columbine Knolls, an 11-year-old subdivision they had moved to two
years ago when Eric Harris' father retired from the military and
took a civilian job.
</P>
<P>
   The agents carted away computers, computer printouts, gas cans,
boxes of matches, videocassettes and bags of books, including one
titled ``Doom,'' after the computer game. Reporters did not see any
weapons removed from the house.
</P>
<P>
   The day before, the Harrises' next-door neighbor, Bill Konen,
had been working in his yard when he heard Dylan Klebold drive up
and ask Eric, ``Do you have a metal baseball bat?''
</P>
<P>
   ``For the next 15 minutes, they were breaking bottles in a
sack,'' Konen continued. ``Apparently, they were making shrapnel.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would never have figured in a million years that bomb-making
activities were going on, or any suspicious activities,'' he said,
standing in his driveway, near a neighborhood watch association
sign.
</P>
<P>
   Some classmates said Eric Harris was good with computers, and
apparently maintained a website on America Online. Files on the
website, discovered after the shootings, depicted him as an avid
player of Doom and Quake, two popular computer games in which
players stalk their opponents through dungeon-like environments and
try to kill them with high-powered weapons.
</P>
<P>
   The files on Harris' Doom and Quake exploits contained programs
he had written to work with the games, as well as his commentary on
them. But despite coming in the context of computer games famous
for their realistic violence, these files, scattered with
enthusiastic observations and exclamation points, provided a
glimpse at a teenager who seemed less angry and morbid than in the
other postings attributed to him.
</P>
<P>
   ``It took me about 10 hours to finish this level, so send some
comments to me once in awhile!'' Harris wrote in one file, dated
Nov. 26, 1996. His comments accompanied a program that he made
available to the public on an Internet site.
</P>
<P>
   Harris was listed as the author on dozens of files known as
``wads,'' which allow players to add new levels of their own design
to the games. In one file, he thanked Dylan Klebold for helping him
test his program.
</P>
<P>
   John C. Dvorak, a columnist at PC Magazine who discovered the
site through his own Internet sleuthing on Wednesday, said he was
struck by the ingenuousness of Harris' writing.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's just kid-like,'' Dvorak said. `That's what's so troubling
about it.''
</P>
<P>
   Also on Wednesday, the Simon Wiesenthal Institute, a group that
monitors hate groups, said two of its researchers had come across
the Harris website several months ago. ``What both people
remembered was how we got to that site, which was by looking at
various anarchy and bomb-making listings,'' said Rabbi Abraham
Cooper, associate dean of the institute.
</P>
<P>
   He said there were no threats that merited contacting
law-enforcement officials or enough hate language to be listed on
the institute's hate site list.
</P>
<P>
   On Wednesday, Dyland Klebold's father, Tom, a geologist, and
mother, Sue, who works for the Arapahoe County schools, issued a
statement: ``We cannot begin to convey our overwhelming sense of
sorrow for everyone affected by this tragedy. Our thoughts, prayers
and heartfelt apologies go out to the victims, their families,
friends and the entire community.''
</P>
<P>
   Classmates described Klebold as tall and skinny, a bit gangly,
with shaggy blonde hair. Harris was much shorter and dark-haired.
Both favored the all-black attire known as part of ``goth,'' the
fashion of the mock-gothic musical subculture known for a
fascination with death.
</P>
<P>
   There is no known connection between the students' interest in
goth or violent computer games and their rampage on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   A photograph of Klebold in the 1998 yearbook is accompanied by a
statement. ``After going through many experiences in their lives,''
it read, ``oftentimes students have regrets of past actions.''
</P>
<P>
   Columbine is regarded as a top-notch school, one of the draws to
Littleton. A sheriff's deputy is posted to the school, but students
say the officer's duties have mostly centered on catching students
who park in faculty spaces.
</P>
<P>
   Athletic prowess was often the way to popularity at Columbine,
as at many schools, and students here say Harris and Klebold, who
did not play sports, detested athletes.
</P>
<P>
   ``The athletes get a lot of attention at school,'' said Kristin
Couris, a 17-year-old junior and lacrosse player, who said the
school's closed-circuit television often carried accounts of
ball-field heroics. ``They didn't like that.''
</P>
<P>
   Jeff Matthews, a 16-year-old junior, said Klebold and Harris had
turned to the trenchcoat group because they did not fit with any
other group. ''I guess when you have a lack of friends, you feel
unwanted,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Sara Schweitzberger, 15, had a gym class with Klebold, and said
it was obvious he felt socially ostracized. ''He really felt
unloved,'' she said. ``He wasn't so bad. He was lonely. I just wish
I could give him a hug and tell him that I care.''
</P>
<P>
   The trenchcoat group, which numbered from 10 to 30 students in a
school of nearly 2,000, would usually keep its distance from the
other students, often gathering under the steps during lunchtime,
while everyone else ate at cafeteria tables.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a pretty preppie, conservative school,'' said Miss
Jackson. ``Kids wear Ambercrombie, Tommy Hilfiger, American
Eagle.''
</P>
<P>
   But Monica Schuster, a 17-year-old senior, said that she and a
companion had double dated with Klebold and a friend of his at the
senior prom last Saturday night.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had a great time,'' she said.

MONUMENTAL THRONE UNEARTHED AT MAYAN TEMPLE COMPLEX 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Texas, Calif.)  (bl) 
 By JULIA PRESTON   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   MEXICO CITY _ In rain forests at the foot of the Yucatan
Peninsula, Mexican and American archaeologists have uncovered a
monumental art work that appears to be one of the most revealing
artifacts that has been found from the resplendent but mysterious
final years of ancient Mayan civilization.
</P>
<P>
   While digging through a crumbling temple at Palenque, site of
some of the most refined Mayan ruins in Mesoamerica, the
researchers came upon a benchlike throne more than 9 feet wide and
5 feet deep in vermillion-painted limestone, which one of the last
Mayan rulers built about A.D. 760 to dazzle his subjects and
convince them of his god-given right to power.
</P>
<P>
   What became of the Classic Mayans, who developed the only
pre-Colombian writing in the Americas and devised an intricate
astronomy to chart the movements of the heavens, is one of the
great puzzles of archaeology. During the ninth century, flourishing
cities like Palenque were abruptly abandoned, in what seems from
the record of the ruins to have been a cultural collapse.
</P>
<P>
   The Palenque throne is adorned with at least 200 heiroglyphs and
six sculptured portraits that, based on the experts' first reading,
disclose the achievements and illusions of the Mayan nobility in
the decades just before their demise.
</P>
<P>
   The discovery also signifies a high point of cooperation between
Mexican and American archaeologists, after a long period in which
Mexico was uneasy about foreigners' digging in its pre-Hispanic
sites.
</P>
<P>
   To show Mexican enthusiasm for the find, President Ernesto
Zedillo flew to Palenque on Wednesday to display the partly
excavated throne.
</P>
<P>
   The Palenque explorations are in the hands of a team led by
Arnoldo Gonzalez Cruz of the National Institute of Anthropology and
History in Mexico City and Alfonso Morales of the University of
Texas at Austin. The project is largely financed and directed by
the Pre-Columbian Art Research Institute of San Francisco. An art
historian, Merle Greene Robertson, directs the institute.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're working as a group,'' said Morales, who has been keenly
aware of Mexican sensitivities about the excavation. ``No one can
say, `This is my throne, that is my temple.'''
</P>
<P>
   Mexican authorities suppressed all public discussion of the find
for weeks to allow Zedillo to announce it.
</P>
<P>
   Morales said the grandeur of the throne and the spaciousness of
the palace that houses it indicate that the last rulers of Palenque
were more ambitious and proud of their power than had been
understood. The palace, decorated with fine stucco carvings, is
even larger than another structure that had been considered the
central palace at Palenque.
</P>
<P>
   Down zigzagging stairways that lead into the heart of that
palace, a Mayan king named Pakal built a mausoleum for himself
covered with delicate carvings and inscriptions aimed at enhancing
his historical reputation. The tomb has long been considered one of
the greatest works of Mayan artistry.
</P>
<P>
   The newly found throne belonged to a monarch descended from
Pakal and is part of what is emerging as a construction program by
later rulers even more extensive than that of the vainglorious
Pakal. The throne carries more inscriptions laden with more
historical information than any other in the Mayan world,
archaeologists said.
</P>
<P>
   Morales and other experts believe that mapping the grandiose
building projects could be crucial to reaching a new understanding
of the Maya decline. The scientists have theorized that the logging
required to sustain the stucco construction may have depleted
forests and compounded ecological changes, perhaps undermining
agriculture and forcing the Mayans to migrate to less hospitable
territory.

 LITTLETON, Colo.: urban schools.  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Staley said she had never worried about violence at the school.
``It's a big deal when someone throws eggs at your house on
Halloween,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Columbine's male athletes, tall, muscular and radiating
confidence and authority in their Abercrombie shirts and jeans,
stood out in the crowd on Wednesday. It was easy to imagine their
inspiring jealousy among some of their less popular classmates.
</P>
<P>
   ``We'd be walking down the hall, and people would say, `Stupid
jocks,' '' said Brad Johnson, 18, a senior who played for the
football and rugby teams. ``I guess it's because they weren't
jocks.''
</P>
<P>
   Jason and Justin Baer, 16-year-old twins, and their brother
Jarett, 15, are not jocks. It can be hard not being one of them at
a sports-minded school like Columbine, they said.
</P>
<P>
   ``At the beginning of the semester, they made me clear their
table in the cafeteria,'' said Jarett, who had his blond hair in
short gelled spikes at the front. ``I was like, `No.' They were
like, `Do it now.' I just lived with it.''
</P>
<P>
   Whatever group people belonged to, everyone was welcome at the
after-prom party last weekend. The theme was ``New York, New
York.'' The parents had worked on it for a year. Wednesday, people
were talking about the party, and the pep rally that preceded it,
as if they were events from a vanished innocence.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was perfect,'' said Richard Colbert, 16, who plays guitar
for a Christian music group, Ten String Lyre. ``Nobody got high.
The week before, everyone signed prom contracts, saying they
wouldn't drink, or drink anddrive.''
</P>
<P>
   The year before, a student had been killed in a car accident
after the prom. But this year no one got hurt. It was considered
another Columbine triumph.

NATO'S ATTACK ON MEDIA SENDS MESSAGE TO MILOSEVIC 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By STEVEN ERLANGER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   BELGRADE, Yugoslavia _ When NATO struck hard at Yugoslavia's
political and media elite early Wednesday morning, it sent a clear
message that after weeks of hesitation, the alliance would now hit
the business interests of President Slobodan Milosevic's family and
friends.
</P>
<P>
   The three cruise missiles that set a 24-story building aflame
knocked three television stations off the air and destroyed the
offices of the political parties of Milosevic and his wife.
</P>
<P>
   It was NATO's first attack on the Yugoslav mass media in
Belgrade. The main state network, Radio and Television of Serbia,
was not hit and remained on the air.
</P>
<P>
   The building, formerly the Central Committee of the Yugoslav
Communist Party, contains the offices of Milosevic's Serbian
Socialist Party; the offices of the Yugoslav United Left party of
his wife, Mirjana Markovic; the studios and transmitters of radio
and TV Kosava, or Wind, which belongs to their daughter, Marija;
the studios and transmitters of TV Pink, which belongs to a family
friend, Zeljko Mitrovic, a prominent member of Yugoslav Left; the
studio and transmitter of the main sports channel, SOS, and the
main transmitter of BK TV, which owned by four brothers named
Karic, one of whom, Bogoljub, is a Yugoslav Left minister without
portfolio in the Serbian government.
</P>
<P>
   All the stations were knocked off the air, except for the
entertainment channel, Pink, which can be seen in one area of
Belgrade because Mitrovic also has a small transmitter on the roof
of his house in the elite residential and diplomatic area of
Dedinje. Late Wednesday evening, BK was back on the air in
Belgrade, although with a weak and blurry picture.
</P>
<P>
   An attack on the northern city of Novi Sad hit transmitters that
left the city of 400,000 without any television reception at all,
including the channels of state television.
</P>
<P>
   The last of Novi Sad's three bridges over the Danube was also
badly damaged, closing it to road and rail traffic. While the
Zezeljev bridge still stands, it is safe only for pedestrians now,
officials said. On Wednesday afternoon, NATO bombed a railway
bridge nine miles west of Belgrade.
</P>
<P>
   At a news conference in Belgrade on Wednesday, Robert Nemecek, a
program director for Pink, bemoaned the loss, in the conflagration,
of 123 episodes of ``The Simpsons'' and new episodes of ``Chicago
Hope'' and ``Friends.'' ``It is all burned,'' he said sadly.
</P>
<P>
   NATO officials said Wednesday that the building was a military
target, because it was part of a link in the city's coordinated air
defense system of radars and communication. But few here took the
NATO disclaimer at face value.
</P>
<P>
   The Serbian prime minister, Mirko Marjanovic, condemned the
attack as having no military purpose. ``This is yet more evidence
that the criminals target civilians,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   A senior Serbian journalist said: ``I'm now a lost cause for
their propaganda messages. All I can think of is that they just
killed some poor people who were on the night shift.''
</P>
<P>
   While there were no official reports of casualties, local
journalists said that at least 15 people had been working in the
building at about 3:15 a.m. when the first missile hit.
</P>
<P>
   In an interview with BBC World Television, the Yugoslav deputy
prime minister, Vuk Draskovic, a relative liberal, said again
Wednesday that the official news media were ``hiding'' casualty
figures and ``I don't know why.'' He said, also vaguely, that ``a
few thousand people, almost all of them civilians, are killed or
injured'' in NATO's attacks.
</P>
<P>
   But the spokesman for the Yugoslav Foreign Ministry, Nebojsa
Vujovic, has said on the record that more than 300 civilians have
been killed and up to 3,000 wounded since the NATO attacks began.
</P>
<P>
   Serbs here also say that NATO is dropping Serbian-language
propaganda leaflets in larger numbers. Oddly, a leaflet dropped
last week, which advertised radio and television frequencies on
which NATO information might be heard, included the frequencies for
Radio Kosava (102.2), which was not off the air until Wednesday
morning, and for B-92 (92.5), which has been taken over by the
government but remains on the air.
</P>
<P>
   Other frequencies listed, under the NATO logo and the headline
``We want to speak with you,'' include 106.4 and 1003 medium wave,
as well as television channel 21. NATO has been flying radio and TV
transmitter planes over Yugoslavia, but few Yugoslavs have seen or
heard the relatively weak transmissions.
</P>
<P>
   Another leaflet attempts to describe events in Kosovo, saying:
``For the last week Serb armies and police, under direct orders of
Slobodan Milosevic, have emptied the villages and towns of Kosovo''
and ``burned or destroyed thousands of houses.''
</P>
<P>
   The leaflet asserts that ``heads of families were torn away from
their wives and kids and killed'' in what it calls, in boldface,
``Milosevic's pogrom.'' It continues, ``There is a fear that
thousands of innocent people have been killed.''
</P>
<P>
   It concludes, in boldface, ``Do not allow misguided patriotism
to connect you to his misdeeds,'' and then ends with a sort of
advertising slogan: ``NATO defends the defenseless.''
</P>
<P>
   The leaflet fails to mention the fundamental NATO demand, which
Milosevic has firmly rejected, that Kosovo be occupied by an
international security force with a core of armed NATO troops. Most
Serbs interviewed strongly oppose an armed foreign force in Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   The effectiveness of such propaganda leaflets, which remind many
educated Serbs of the leafletting efforts of the Nazis in World War
II, is impossible to know. Many Serbs in larger cities have access
to Western satellite television in any event.
</P>
<P>
   Many of those interviewed over the last month who have such
access, or access to the Internet, nonetheless regard Western
assertions of Nazi-like atrocities as exaggerated and hyperbolic.
The more damage NATO does to ordinary Serbs on behalf of the ethnic
Albanians, one senior Serbian journalist said, ``the less people
worry very much about them.''
</P>
<P>
   Another Serbian journalist said, ``There's a feeling that we're
all collateral damage now.''

 &HT;    Harsh reality hits shocked Littleton, Colo.
 &HT;    By Mike Williams
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   LITTLETON, Colo. _ After a lonely, dread-filled night, the grim
news finally came officially Wednesday afternoon for the families
of those killed in the Columbine High School shooting rampage.
</P>
<P>
   Their cherished loved ones, twelve young students and one
teacher, wouldn't be coming home.
</P>
<P>
   Neither would the two angry boys, Eric Harris and Dylan Klebold,
who barged into their school with duffel bags brimming with guns
and homemade bombs, writing a murderous page of history for reasons
this shell-shocked community is struggling to understand.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was in denial all day yesterday,'' said Michael Shoels,
father of Isaiah Shoels, one of the victims. ``But I knew yesterday
that he wasn't going to come back.''
</P>
<P>
   As squads of police gingerly picked their way through the
sprawling school building in a search for about 30 bombs left by
the teen-age assailants, hundreds of mourners gathered on a grassy
knoll near the school's entrance.
</P>
<P>
   They laid flower bouquets, hand-scribbled poems, Bible passages
and teddy bears in heaping piles near trees budding with spring
leaves. They gathered in circles, heads bowed, to pray and sing.
</P>
<P>
   They hugged and cried and ran across the grass among the milling
crowd to throw themselves at friends they feared would never walk
out of their school again.
</P>
<P>
   ``Make sense of it?'' said Trish O'Neill, whose daughter Becky
Beachy, 16, escaped unharmed. ``We can't.''
</P>
<P>
   Police took nearly 24 hours to declare the school building safe
after the four-hour melee began, mostly because fleeing students
had dropped hundreds of book bags and backpacks that had to be
gingerly inspected for explosives.
</P>
<P>
   Veteran law enforcement officers blanched at the gruesome work,
saying they were surprised at the sophistication of the bombs, some
of which were rigged with timers. They were also appalled at the
carnage.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've been a SWAT-team officer since 1980 and this was clearly
the most devastating, traumatic scene I've ever been a part of,''
officer George Hinkle told reporters. ``I hope to never see
anything like this again.''
</P>
<P>
   Among the victims were 11 males _ including the shooters, who
apparently killed themselves _ and four females. One teacher, Dave
Sanders, who also was coach of the girls' baseball team, was killed
after reportedly shoving students out of an opened doorway and
taking gunshots to the chest.
</P>
<P>
   Several Columbine students tried desperately to stop Sanders
from bleeding to death by holding makeshift bandages to his wounds
and applying pressure for the more than three hours they had to
wait for help.
</P>
<P>
   When the attack started, a school resource police officer was on
duty at Columbine and returned fire at the assailants within
minutes, Jefferson County Sheriff spokesman Steve Davis said. An ad
hoc SWAT team was on the scene within 20 minutes, he added,
although it took more than 90 minutes to assemble the full SWAT
team and get them to the school.
</P>
<P>
   Police did not release the names of the dead victims, saying
they wanted the families to have time to grieve in private.
</P>
<P>
   Twenty-three people, mostly students, were hospitalized with
wounds. Late Wednesday, five remained in critical condition and
five more in serious condition.
</P>
<P>
   Around the Denver metro area, churches held prayer vigils and
memorial services, opening their doors to a community still in
shock. Schools were closed.
</P>
<P>
   The tragedy drew worldwide attention, with many overseas media
focusing on America's deadly history of gun violence. Reporters
from Europe, South America and Asia were at the scene. One Japanese
headline reportedly read, ``How sick is the gun society?''
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton expressed his sorrow to the families of the
dead in a news conference, again decrying the violence that has
recently erupted in the nation's schools in similar, shocking
incidents in Arkansas, Mississippi, Kentucky and Oregon.
</P>
<P>
   The Colorado Legislature, which happens to be debating a
controversial gun bill, held a moment of silence, then adjourned
out of respect for the victims. Professional sports events in
Denver were canceled.
</P>
<P>
   As in the wake of the other school shootings, the biggest
question _ and one nobody could answer _ was why.
</P>
<P>
   Witnesses said Harris and Klebold targeted athletes and
minorities, laughing at their victims and using a racial epithet to
describe the one black victim, Isaiah Shoels. ``All jocks stand
up!'' one of the boys yelled during the attack. ``We're going to
kill every one of you.'' But District Attorney Dave Thomas said
there was no evidence that the killers targeted minorities, as some
students claimed.
</P>
<P>
   According to their friends, Harris, 18, and Klebold, 17, were
part of a loose-knit group called the ``Trench Coat Mafia'' and
often dressed in black, favoring leather and the long coats that
have been featured in numerous violence-filled Hollywood movies.
</P>
<P>
   They were described alternately as loners who stayed to
themselves, or as rebels who reveled in their status as outcasts,
thumbing their noses at convention.
</P>
<P>
   ``They took some teasing, but everybody in high school gets
teased,'' said Josh Swanson, a senior who knew the boys. ``If
anything, the most teasing was for Dylan over his personal hygiene.
He didn't bathe sometimes, and he smelled pretty bad.''
</P>
<P>
   Alex Marsh, another student who was a member of the trench coat
group, said the boys did have a mean streak.
</P>
<P>
   ``If they liked you, they were the sweetest guys in the world,''
she told reporters. ``But if they didn't like you, you better watch
your back.''
</P>
<P>
   The boys played violent computer games for hours, friends said.
They also reportedly dabbled heavily in Nazi paraphernalia,
sometimes wearing swastikas. Harris set up an Internet home page
that spouted Nazi ideology and condoned violence. The shootings
took place on the 110th anniversary of Adolf Hitler's birth.
</P>
<P>
   But even friends couldn't fathom the hate that seemed to boil
out of the pair during their rampage.
</P>
<P>
   Crystal Woodman, a junior who was in the library when the gunmen
burst in, said she couldn't get their voices out of her head.
</P>
<P>
   ``They thought it was funny,'' Woodman told ``Good Morning
America.'' ``They were just, like `Who's next? Who's ready to die?'
They were just, like, `We've waited to do this our whole lives.'
And every time they'd shoot someone, they'd holler, like it was,
like, exciting.''
</P>
<P>
   The boys lived in upscale neighborhoods in Littleton, a
bustling, prosperous suburb on Denver's sprawling southwest border.
</P>
<P>
   Stunned school officials groped for answers on how they could've
prevented the tragedy, just as their counterparts have in other
cities marred by student shootings.
</P>
<P>
   ``How could we let this happen?'' a shaken Howard Cornell, the
school district's security director, told ABC News. ``I don't think
anybody has the answer.''
</P>
<P>
   In other developments:
</P>
<P>
   _ The gunmen's families would not speak to reporters, but both
issued statements Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our thoughts, prayers and heartfelt apologies go out to the
victims, their families, friends, and the entire community,'' the
Klebold family said. ``Like the rest of the country, we are
struggling to understand why this happened, and ask that you please
respect our privacy during this painful grieving period.''
</P>
<P>
   Harris' parents said: ``We want to express our heartfelt
sympathy to the families of all the victims and to all the
community for this senseless tragedy. Please say prayers for
everyone touched by these terrible events.''
</P>
<P>
   _ Jefferson County Sheriff John Stone's initial estimate of as
many as 25 dead in the massacre was off the mark apparently because
the six SWAT teams that swept the building counted some victims
more than once. By early Wednesday, his deputies said the death
toll was 15.
</P>
<P>
   _ The National Rifle Association still plans to hold its annual
meeting in Denver next weekend, but will cancel all its seminars,
exhibitions and luncheons in deference to the school shootings in
Littleton.
</P>
<P>
   ``The tragedy in Littleton last Tuesday calls upon us to take
steps ... to modify our schedule to show our profound sympathy and
respect for the families and communities in the Denver area in
their time of great loss,'' says a letter sent to NRA members in
Colorado. The letter was signed by NRA President Charlton Heston
and Executive Vice President Wayne LaPierre and was released by the
Virginia-based NRA on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   _ More than a dozen federal agents from the Bureau of Alcohol,
Tobacco and Firearms focused on tracing the arsenal _ two sawed-off
shotguns, one handgun and one carbine, the White House said _ to
determine who licensed them, and how and where the teen-age
suspects got hold of such firepower.

THE QUEST FOR GIGANTIC BROOD TROUT
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By BRETT PAULY  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   INDEPENDENCE, Calif. _ They are the hardest workers in the fish
hatchery, called on to perform critical chores for little more than
room and board and a slap on the back.
</P>
<P>
   They are the invaluable brood fish spawned to ensure generations
of trout will be planted for the enjoyment of Eastern Sierra
anglers.
</P>
<P>
   But the greatest reward _ for brooder and angler alike _ is
earned after the final genetic contributions have been made:
freedom.
</P>
<P>
   Tagged with metal clips on their gill plates so anglers can
identify them as part of the Department of Fish and Game's trophy
trout program, thousands of brood males and females are released in
regional waters each year. Typically 3 to 5 pounds or more, they
dwarf the standard half-pound trout that are planted at catchable
sizes. These are, quite literally, the mothers of all stockers.
</P>
<P>
   Little publicized, the release of behemoth brood trout may come
as a surprise to many anglers, especially when they discover the
locations of two of the stocking sites _ Diaz Lake and Haiwee
Reservoir, which can be fished year-round, unlike most Eastern
Sierra fishing holes. Largely underutilized and underappreciated
fisheries found south of Lone Pine, they are viewed as little more
than tiny oases rising up past the Mojave Desert as Southern
California anglers travel Highway 395 to more revered waters.
</P>
<P>
   ``Funny,'' said Diaz Lake regular Orville ``O.J.'' Bain of
Olancha, ``everybody thinks of trout fishing in Mammoth and Crowley
Lake. A lot of people don't pay any attention. (Diaz) looks like a
muddy puddle, but, yeah, it's a pretty good fishing lake.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, at a mere 100 surface acres, it would take 50 Diaz-size
lakes to cover Crowley's 5,280 surface acres.
</P>
<P>
   And, indeed, there are pretty good fish in Diaz. The lake record
is a 14-pound rainbow caught Jan. 16, 1995, by Ridgecrest's
Michelle Oettli.
</P>
<P>
   Bain's wife, Germaine, caught an 8-pound rainbow last year that
taped out at 25 inches. She isn't bothered in the least by the
lake's lack of advertising; it just means more elbowroom for her.
``I like the fresh air, the view, nobody bothering me,'' the former
Van Nuys resident said lakeside on Friday.
</P>
<P>
   Largemouth bass run to 8 pounds, catfish to more than 20 pounds,
and there are plenty of bluegill, too. But it is the brood rainbow
and brown trout that get the most attention.
</P>
<P>
   ``Someone today will catch a fish that will go over 5 pounds;
that happens almost daily,'' said Diaz Lake park ranger Steve
Rinker, whose post sits within view of four Eastern Sierra peaks
topping 14,000 feet _ from the south, Langley, Muir, Whitney and
Russell.
</P>
<P>
   Farther south is seldom-targeted Haiwee Reservoir (pronounced
HAY-wee), where smallmouth and largemouth bass dine on steady diets
of crawdad and rainbow and brown brooders occasionally are stocked.
</P>
<P>
   While Diaz Lake, situated 100 or so yards west of 395, is
perhaps the most accessible roadside lake in the Eastern Sierra,
Haiwee is anything but. Anglers can put in miles of footwork to
properly work the reservoir.
</P>
<P>
   Less than 500 brood trout go into Diaz and Haiwee each year from
the Mount Whitney and Black Rock state fish hatcheries north of
Independence. The number pales in comparison to the 12,500 brooders
that are trucked out of Mammoth Lake's Hot Creek hatchery to Tioga,
Saddleback, Ellery and Convict lakes, as well as the Mammoth Lakes,
those waters found in the June Lakes Loop and the Upper Owens River
between Benton Crossing and Crowley Lake.
</P>
<P>
   But it's the notion of hooking into one of a handful of
``super-trophy trout'' _ specimens ranging up to 15 pounds or more
that escape the Black Rock hatchery via drainage canals but are
later caught by hook and line for release _ that draw some anglers
to Diaz and Haiwee.
</P>
<P>
   If the estimated 12{-pound leviathan that Black Rock fish and
wildlife assistant James Booth caught last month for the
brood-release program, Diaz anglers can be in for quite a fight.
</P>
<P>
   ``I caught it on 6-pound test,'' Booth said. ``It took me about
20 minutes to get it in, and it wouldn't fit in one of our big
nets. It was pretty close to 32 inches long.''
</P>
<P>
   The crew that tagged the brute called it Walter.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, if you don't meet Walter at Diaz Lake, you can always
see his brooder brethren ... at the hatcheries _ Mount Whitney and
Black Rock, (760) 878-2272, and Hot Creek, (760) 934-2664. &QL; 
 &QL;

</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
IF YOU'RE GOING
</P>
<P>
   Brood stock _ trout that's kept to spawn and grow to trophy
sizes at hatcheries _ are released periodically throughout the
Eastern Sierra. Two of the lesser-known planting sites are Diaz
Lake and Haiwee Reservoir, which, unlike the bulk of the region,
can be fished year-round. &QL; 
X X X
</P>
<P>
   There are several roads that access Los Angeles Aqueduct-fed
Haiwee Reservoir off Highway 395, the southernmost of which, South
Haiwee Road, is located 6{ miles north of Coso Junction and 24\
miles north of Pearsonville. (Pearsonville is about 145 miles north
of the San Fernando Valley.) North Haiwee Road is 4 miles south of
Olancha and 22 miles south of Lone Pine.
</P>
<P>
   Because it is a domestic water supply earnestly protected from
pollution, boating other than float-tubing, swimming and any direct
body contact with the water is prohibited. Sealed waders are
required for float-tubing and wade-fishing. No overnight camping,
campfires or fish cleaning are permitted on the Los Angeles
Department of Water and Power property.
</P>
<P>
   It's not exactly easy to fish Haiwee, especially when one reads
posted signs like this: ``Danger mountain lions have been observed.
Proceed at your own risk.''
</P>
<P>
   If you think that's bad, it's an awful long way to walk or bike
_ no direct vehicle access is available _ from the parking areas to
Haiwee, which is actually two reservoirs that measure 3{ miles long
and a half-mile wide between them. The waters opened to the public
in 1994. At least parking is free.

   A geologic oddity, Diaz Lake, always a wetland, was formed as a
result of a major earthquake that hit the Owens Valley on March 26,
1872, according to a historic marker there. The ground below the
lake dropped 16 to 20 feet and a new spring formed, causing water
to fill the lowland.
</P>
<P>
   Named for the Diaz family that established a ranch here when
Chilean brothers Rafael and Eleuterio Diaz immigrated in the 1860s,
it was owned and operated as a successful cattle ranch until the
land was sold to the Los Angeles DWP, which now leases the lake to
Inyo County.

is free.

GOTH GENRES, FRINGE ROCK AND GERMANY 
</HEADLINE>
   (af)  
 By TODD S. PURDUM   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Like generations of teen-age misfits and outcasts
before them, the post-pubescent gunmen in the Colorado school
shootings apparently found comfort in the words of the darker bards
of their age _ in this case in the depressive, anarchic, nihilistic
and suicidal musings of the disparate strands of fringe rock music
genres known as Goth and industrial.
</P>
<P>
   It is not clear that either of the presumed gunmen firmly
identified himself as a Goth or industrial adherent, or that their
musical tastes had anything to do with the shootings. But
schoolmates said that at least one of the two wore a baseball cap
with the logo of the popular industrial band KMFDM, and he
apparently posted its apocalyptic lyrics on a personal Web page.
</P>
<P>
   Goth, shorthand for Gothic, grew out of the ashes of punk-rock
in Britain in the late 1970s, and later took root in Los Angeles
under the rubric of ``death rock.''
</P>
<P>
   Industrial music flowered in Northern Europe and North America
beginning in the 1980s on the theory that the everyday mechanical
sounds of the modern age could be captured, recorded and
manipulated into music that questioned authority and orthodoxy.
</P>
<P>
   The two genres have since spread from urban underground clubs to
suburban fans. The styles sometimes overlap and not even their
adherents can agree on precisely how to categorize artists and
bands.
</P>
<P>
   But the essence of Goth is ``very depressing, kill-yourself
music,'' said Ali Ohta, the director of publicity for Cleopatra
Records, the nation's largest Goth label, based in Los Angeles.
</P>
<P>
   The cross-gendered sepulchral shock rocker Marilyn Manson has
Goth overtones of makeup and dress, though many Goths do not
consider him one of their own.
</P>
<P>
   Eric Harris, one of the two suspected gunmen, maintained a Web
page and user profile on America Online in which he quoted lyrics
of KMFDM, which was founded in Germany and whose name is shorthand
for ``Keine Mehrheit fur die Mitleid,'' which loosely translates as
``No majority for pity.''
</P>
<P>
   KMFDM, founded by Sascha Konietzko in Paris in 1984 in a
performance that featured the sound of Polish coalminers banging
their tools, has been based in the Pacific Northwest and Canada in
recent years. It broke up in January and released its last album,
``Adios,'' on Tuesday, the day of the shootings, according to its
official Web site.
</P>
<P>
   The two suspected gunmen were reported to have harbored a hatred
for minorities and a fascination with Hitler. But Nicole Blackman,
a former spokeswoman for KMFDM, said that the band did not
subscribe to racist or neo-Nazi views.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Blackman said the band's message was ``rip the system,'' but
added: ``I can't understand how a couple of kids in Colorado in
black trench coats could think that KMFDM's message is to go out
and shoot people.''

DOW CLIMBS 132.87 POINTS 
</HEADLINE>
  (sw) 
 By ROBERT D. HERSHEY Jr.   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK - Strong profit reports helped fuel a rally in stocks
on Wednesday as technology and consumer issues appeared to regain
the leadership they long enjoyed. Stocks tied to the business
cycle, meanwhile, mostly paused after their recent run-up.
</P>
<P>
   The three main market gauges finished at their best levels of
the day, with the Nasdaq composite index posting a 3.3 percent gain
that, combined with Tuesday's rebound, wiped out Monday's 5.56
percent slide, the seventh worst on record. It was the index's
biggest two-day gain in three months.
</P>
<P>
   The Dow Jones industrial average climbed 132.87 points, to
10,581.42, a record. The average is up 15.25 percent so far this
year. The Standard &AMP; Poor's 500-stock index increased by 29.95
points, or 2.3 percent, to 1,336.12.
</P>
<P>
   ``The market really has recovered very nicely from the earlier
tech weakness,'' said Mary Farrell, a senior strategist at Paine
Webber Inc. ``It's indicative of some underlying strength.''
</P>
<P>
   Another favorable sign, analysts said, was an impressive surge
in small-company stocks, which have long been out of favor. The
Russell 2000 index of smaller-company shares, which includes some
Internet companies but has not set a record this year, advanced 2.7
percent and edged into positive territory for the year.
</P>
<P>
   Drug stocks, which have been battered lately, continued a
rebound that began on Tuesday with solid earnings reports for three
drug makers. On Wednesday, Bristol-Myers climbed 5, to 64\, after
it reported better-than-expected profits and was raised to a
``buy'' at Merrill Lynch.
</P>
<P>
   Pfizer, which had traded as high as 150[ early last week, rose
4| on Wednesday, to 123].
</P>
<P>
   Profits at Coca-Cola eased, but by slightly less than Wall
Street had feared, and its shares rose 2 5-16, to 67 9-16, still
well below its high of 88 15/16 last July.
</P>
<P>
   But the real stars of the day were Internet and other technology
stocks despite a warning by Microsoft, down 1[, to 82, that some
companies may delay software purchases until next year because of
the expected year 2000 problem.
</P>
<P>
   Qualcomm, which handily surpassed profit estimates, soared 54
7-16, to 195 1-16, after reaching 198, more than five times the
cellular phone maker's price in early October.
</P>
<P>
   Lucent jumped 4~, to 59[; Charles Schwab rose 11\, to 118; Texas
Instruments climbed 8}, to 108}; Motorola rose 4 7-16, to 80 3-16;
Amazon.com leaped 7\, to 179\, and Hewlett-Packard rose 3}, to 75[.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've had no end of commentary about how overpriced'' many
high-technology stocks have gotten, said Thom R. Brown, managing
director of Rutherford, Brown and Catherwood in Philadelphia. ``But
these things are roaring today.''
</P>
<P>
   IBM, which reported a sharp rise in profit after the close,
gained 2[, to 171~. Compaq Computer edged up \, to 24\, after
reporting earnings that met sharply reduced expectations.
</P>
<P>
   American Express, which is scheduled to report a profit on
Thursday, was the Dow's biggest gainer, rising 7], to 134~,
followed by General Electric, up 4\, to 113 9-16, and Johnson &AMP;
Johnson, up 4{, to 100}, after jumping 6 on Tuesday on strong
earnings.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the rejuvenation of growth stocks in the latest two
sessions, some value-oriented money managers said they thought the
recent rotation into cyclical and smaller stocks had further to go.
</P>
<P>
   ``The earnings outlook is more positive'' than for technology,
said Richard E. Cripps, chief strategist at Legg Mason in
Baltimore. ``And the breadth of the value market has taken on a
better tone.''
</P>
<P>
   On the New York Stock Exchange, volume subsided to a still-heavy
920.1 million shares, with 1,954 advancing issues versus 1,114
declining ones. A total of 52 stocks set new highs, while 22 had
new lows. On the Nasdaq, 1.13 billion shares changed hands.

PANEL CONSIDERING REQUEST FOR MILITARY FUNDS TALKS ABOUT ECHOES OF
VIETNAM
</HEADLINE>
   (rk) 
 By TIM WEINER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Congressional Republicans raised the specter of the
Vietnam War Wednesday at a hearing on President Clinton's emergency
request for more than $5 billion in military funds for NATO's air
campaign against Serbian forces.
</P>
<P>
   But Secretary of Defense William S. Cohen and Gen. Henry H.
Shelton, chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, assured them that
the United States would not slowly slide toward a full-bore war in
the Balkans _ not without a great public debate.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am absolutely committed to making sure that we do not have
the kind of gradualism that happened during the Vietnam War,''
Cohen said. If months of bombing achieves no results, and a ground
war looms, ``We'll be up here in five months explaining it,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   Shelton agreed that the United States would not go to war
without ``our eyes wide open,'' without ``a healthy debate'' and
without ``public support.''
</P>
<P>
   The secretary and the chairman appeared before the House
appropriations defense subcommittee, the first panel to weigh
President Clinton's request for $5.1 billion in emergency funds to
finance NATO's air war. Shelton asked for ``swift approval'' of the
request; Cohen said the military needs the money ``tomorrow.''
</P>
<P>
   That appears unlikely. Congressional Republicans are divided on
whether to add a few billion dollars more to the emergency request,
or many billions.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some of our most ardent defense hawks are running around with
charts and graphs demanding $28 billion,'' a senior Republican aide
said. ``Most of the leadership is around $10 billion. You might see
something above that.''
</P>
<P>
   Cohen said the president's request was adequate to finance the
American role in an intensifying air war until Sept. 30, the end of
the fiscal year. He suggested that the Pentagon would not reject
out of hand a few billion more. But Democrats will not support a
bill of the kind that the Republican hawks are pushing. And the
Republicans will not settle on the sum they will seek until next
week.
</P>
<P>
   The argument over money is about politics as well as the conduct
of the conflict. Some Republicans on the appropriations panel
suggested that the conflict would become Clinton's Vietnam _ a
deepening military morass, fought in the name of human rights
instead of anti-Communism.

MASSACRE CALLED SIGN OF INADEQUATE MENTAL HEALTH CARE FOR YOUTHS 
</HEADLINE>

<P>
   Child psychologists and other experts on youth violence said
Tuesday's killings in Colorado are evidence of a woeful lack of
mental health services for young people at a time of decreasing
family strength and increasing access to the tools of violence.
</P>
<P>
   They also said parents, teachers and students themselves ought
to be receiving training in the early detection of depression and
violent tendencies. But they added that the continuing stigma of
mental illness, and cutbacks in health insurance due to managed
care, were keeping society from looking frankly at the problem.
</P>
<P>
   ``The true tragedy is that America refuses to recognize that
there are millions of teens and children with psychological
illnesses, which are as real as physical illnesses,'' said Dr.
Harold Koplewicz, director of the Child Study Center at New York
University.
</P>
<P>
   He added that tests were available to spot warning signs like
depression and isolation even in very young children, but that few
schools used them.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is a common theme to all of the shootings of recent
years,'' he said. ``You have a child who has had symptoms of
aggression toward his peers, an interest in fire, cruelty to
animals, social isolation and many warning signs that the school
has ignored. Schools do vision and hearing screenings. Doesn't it
make sense that kindergarten teachers learn how to screen for
aggressive behavior?''
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Suniya Luthar, a professor of psychology at Columbia
University's Teachers College, agreed. ``If we were able to get
teachers to receive even basic tips from professionals about such
things, we might go a long way to preventing violence, suicide and
drug abuse.''
</P>
<P>
   In August, the federal government distributed a guide to safe
schools that outlined ways for administrators and teachers to
recognize potentially violent behavior. It also suggested measures
for school systems to take to prevent violence.
</P>
<P>
   Much emphasis was placed on tight community and family bonds to
schools, which, some administration officials believe, result from
smaller school and class sizes and high academic standards.
</P>
<P>
   ``We see all these issues as linked,'' said Bill Modzeleski, the
director of the Safe and Drug-Free Schools Program of the federal
Department of Education. ``A lot of the factors that put kids at
risk of using alcohol and drugs are the same as those that put them
at risk of violent behavior.''
</P>
<P>
   In Minneapolis on Wednesday, Attorney General Janet Reno said
the only way to curb violence in schools was to give children the
support they needed and to train school authorities to spot
youngsters with potential problems.
</P>
<P>
   Reno said she might push for more counselors in the nation's
schools.
</P>
<P>
   On April 1, a joint program of the departments of Education,
Justice and Health and Human Services was announced to award more
than $300 million in grants to 50 communities to help prevent
school violence.
</P>
<P>
   The grants will cover the purchase of security equipment like
metal detectors and will finance training for teachers,
after-school programs and the hiring of more mental health
professionals for schools, a move welcomed by counselors and other
mental health advocates.
</P>
<P>
   Modzeleski said about 5 percent of schools use walk-through
metal detectors and 10 percent use hand-held devices.
</P>
<P>
   While schools may decide to increase their physical security,
many violence experts argue that such an effort will have limited
effectiveness.
</P>
<P>
   ``The idea that metal detectors will protect us is
shortsighted,'' said Dr. Mark Greenberg, a professor of human
development and family studies at Pennsylvania State University.
``Kids who want to kill will just shoot outside.''
</P>
<P>
   He added that with the growing number of families in which both
parents work, school systems needed to train teachers to be alert
to signs of emotional instability.
</P>
<P>
   Specialists are increasingly arguing that the developing field
of threat assessment, used by the Secret Service to track potential
assassins, can be applied to potentially violent students.
</P>
<P>
   As outlined in a Secret Service handbook, such assessments
involve looking for common patterns of behavior and experience,
including feelings of rejection.
</P>
<P>
   Bernice Berk, a psychologist at the Bank Street School for
Children in Manhattan, said parents needed to learn to be alert to
the anger and frustration of their children.
</P>
<P>
   ``Long before adolescence, we need to be open to children's
humiliation and pain and discouragement,'' she said. ``Parents have
to be really willing to listen to this and accept expressions of
anger at home, whether they are tantrums or inappropriate
language.''
</P>
<P>
   She added that depression, which she called very prevalent, was
closely related to aggression. One is anger turned toward the self;
the other is anger turned toward others.
</P>
<P>
   A number of programs have sprung up around the country aimed at
helping children learn social communication and skills to cope with
frustration and anger.
</P>
<P>
   The Committee for Children, a nonprofit organization in Seattle,
offers a program called ``Second Step'' to teach violence
prevention to children as young as 4, using techniques like taking
turns and dealing with anger. The group says research shows a
marked decrease in aggression and hostility from children who have
been through the program.

NATION WONDERS `WHERE NEXT?' AS BODIES REMOVED 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)

 c.1999 The Boston Globe

<P>
   LITTLETON, Colo. _ Tales of terror and heroism, marbled with a
thick vein of despair, began to emerge Wednesday from the
bullet-ridden, bomb-damaged high school where 15 people died in the
deadliest school attack in US history.
</P>
<P>
   As the residents of this Denver suburb wrapped themselves in
prayer and each other's arms, and the nation wondered why, and
where next, authorities began removing the bodies of one teacher
and 14 students _ two of them the suspected killers _ from
blood-spattered Columbine High School.
</P>
<P>
   The two suspects, Eric D. Harris, 18, and Dylan Bennet Klebold,
17, misfits who dabbled in Nazi worship and other antisocial
behavior, allegedly vented their shared, murderous anger in a
Tuesday rampage that was at once viciously methodical and horribly
random. They died from apparently self-inflicted gunshot wounds to
the head, explosives attached to their bodies.
</P>
<P>
   Before their deaths, during a chaotic hourlong siege, the two
masked gunmen allegedly killed eight male students, four female
students, and one male teacher whose body was found in a closet. At
least 22 others were wounded, and 16 people remained hospitalized
Wednesday, several in critical condition.
</P>
<P>
   Authorities continued to withhold the names of most of the dead,
but parents of missing Columbine students huddled at a nearby
elementary school, awaiting the dreaded word and permission to take
their children home a final time.
</P>
<P>
   The killers had armed themselves with two sawed-off shotguns, a
semiautomatic rifle, and a handgun, along with several hundred
rounds of ammunition, said Jefferson County Sheriff John Stone.
Eight or nine spent cartridge clips _ each capable of containing 10
to 15 rounds _ were found in the school, as were numerous shotgun
shells. Another shotgun was seized from one of the suspects' homes,
along with a computer and other evidence.
</P>
<P>
   The two boys also came equipped with more than 30 homemade
explosive devices in three different forms: crude six- to
eight-inch hand grenades, foot-long pipe bombs, and propane
cylinders with timing devices. Several of the bombs were planted in
cars in the school's parking lot, and some of the hand-held devices
contained nails and other shrapnel, designed for maximum damage.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the flood of new information, much remained in doubt.
Authorities said they did not know the source of the guns or the
bombs. They also were continuing to investigate the possibility
that other youths were involved. Stone said it might have taken
more than two people to carry the duffel bags that contained the
weapons, and District Attorney David J. Thomas said he suspected
``other people were at least aware'' of the plan and would be
prosecuted for failing to act to prevent it.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't see any motive for this attack,'' Stone said, but
added a possible explanation: ``If these people are tied in with
one of these Hitler-type movements ... then our society is sicker
than I thought.''
</P>
<P>
   No one else had been charged as of Wednesday night, and three
friends of Harris and Klebold were released after questioning
Tuesday, Stone said. Like the two suspects, the three are believed
to be members of an outcast clique called the ``Trench Coat Mafia''
that favors long black coats, military fatigues, and a disdain for
authority.
</P>
<P>
   The school Wednesday became a community mecca, with hundreds of
students and families arriving with flowers, many of them crying as
they placed them at the base of a tree as close to the school as
they could get without crossing the ubiquitous yellow police tape.
Students from Columbine's crosstown rival, Chatfield Senior High
School, created a 20- by 20-foot mural of prayers and well wishes,
festooned with flowers, then placed it on the Columbine lawn.
</P>
<P>
   Balloons and ribbons in blue and white _ the school colors _
appeared almost instantly throughout this city of 40,000. While
authorities updated hundreds of reporters about the investigation,
students formed huge prayer circles and turned a red Acura
belonging to one of the presumed victims into a shrine, complete
with candles, flowers, ribbons, and messages of love and loss.
</P>
<P>
   Officials said Columbine might not reopen before the end of the
school year, though other Jefferson County schools were scheduled
to reopen Thursday with heightened security measures and counselors
on hand. ``It might be some long time before we get them back into
that school,'' Stone said. ``We've got a big mess in there.''
</P>
<P>
   Hardened local, state and federal authorities emerged shaken
from the school, describing a bloody scene in which they found
bodies mainly in the school's library _ 10 victims and the two
suspects were found there. The scene was made more surreal by
strobe lights, fire alarms and ankle-deep water from fire
prevention systems that were triggered when bombs exploded in the
cafeteria.
</P>
<P>
   Interviews with witnesses and authorities suggest the gunmen
employed a carefully crafted plan in their assault.
</P>
<P>
   It began at 11:15 a.m., as half of the 1,800 Columbine students
attended classes and the other half spread out among the library,
the cafeteria and off-campus eateries. The school choir was
practicing a song planned for a graduation performance, and a gym
class was headed to the outdoor track.
</P>
<P>
   First, in either a mistake or an attempted diversion, the
suspects exploded a bomb on Wadsworth Avenue, a main road a
quarter-mile west of the school.
</P>
<P>
   Then, at 11:30 a.m., two masked gunmen entered Columbine through
a student door near the cafeteria. Once inside, they tossed several
bombs, the explosions reverberating throughout the school. They
also sprayed bullets around a hallway and then inside the
cafeteria, wounding several students.
</P>
<P>
   Elsewhere in the school, students ran for exits, hid in storage
supply closets, and locked themselves in laboratories.
</P>
<P>
   After a few minutes, the gunmen walked upstairs to the library.
A teacher had already run into the library, warning students that
someone with a gun was in the school and they should get down. As
the students were scrambling from their seats, the gunmen entered.
</P>
<P>
   ``They came in and said, `All you jocks get up. We're going to
kill all of you,''' said Aaron Cohn, a 15-year-old sophomore who
lives just two doors away from Harris's home. ``I heard a `crack,
crack,' and a kid fell to his knees. I'm pretty sure he was dead.''
</P>
<P>
   Then one of the gunmen put what Cohn believes was a 12-gauge
shotgun to his head. ``I don't know why he didn't shoot. Maybe he
got distracted, maybe it was because he knew me,'' Cohn said. But
immediately afterward, the gunman walked over to a student hiding
under a library table and said, ``peek-a-boo'' then fired several
times.
</P>
<P>
   One of the killers then said, ``I hate niggers. Here's that
nigger we keep seeing running around the school.'' Then he fired
three shots, and the other asked, ``Is he dead, is he dead?'' To
which the shooter responded, ``Yeah, he's dead.'' according to
several accounts of the incident, which Cohn also witnessed.
</P>
<P>
   Though witnesses say the gunmen focused on athletes and
minorities, authorities discounted that view and noted that only
one black student was killed, Isiah Shoels, who was shot three
times in the library. They declined to comment on the witness
accounts, citing the ongoing investigation.
</P>
<P>
   While the library shootings were taking place, police were
amassing outside the school. At least three sheriff's deputies,
including one stationed full-time at the school, exchanged gunfire
with the killers upon their arrival shortly after 11:30 a.m., said
Stone, the county sheriff. They did not pursue the gunmen into the
building, however.
</P>
<P>
   At some point, the killers left the library and shot a teacher,
identified by witnesses as Dave Sanders. Several witnesses said
Sanders, in a characteristic act by a beloved teacher and coach,
pushed several girls to safety as he was being shot. ``He pushed my
friend out of the way and saved her life, and he got shot doing
it,'' said Kayley Boyle, 16, a junior.
</P>
<P>
   For several hours, students from a science class who had taken
refuge in a supply closet tried desperately but unsuccessfully to
save him.
</P>
<P>
   Two other victims, both students, were found dead outside the
school building. It was not immediately clear if they had been shot
there or had fled outside after being wounded.
</P>
<P>
   Throughout the ordeal, students inside the school used cell
phones to call police and media, whispering their frightened
dispatches and waiting for help.
</P>
<P>
   While the seige was under way, Klebold's father used an
intermediary to ask authorities if he could come to the school and
help. Thomas, the district attorney, said the offer was rejected
because it was not seen as helpful, partly because authorities were
not in communication with the gunmen. It was not clear how
Klebold's father knew the teen was involved.
</P>
<P>
   One SWAT team leader described arriving on the scene Tuesday
afternoon and seeing a sign in a library window that read, ``Help,
I'm bleeding to death.'' But he said he was unable to act, not
knowing whether hostages were at risk or how many gunmen were
involved.
</P>
<P>
   ``We could have had a band of terrorists in there,'' said Sgt.
George Hinkle of the Lakewood Police Department SWAT team, one of
seven that responded to the shootings. He later heard that the
sign's author was among the dead. On the other hand, he said, he
was able to position his armored vehicle under a second-story
window, helping a wounded student to climb to safety rather than
suffer a 20-foot fall or continued exposure to gunfire.
</P>
<P>
   SWAT teams did not approach what Hinkle called the ``killing
zone'' _ the library _ until roughly an hour after the shooting
began. He and other law-enforcement officials said acting sooner
could have endangered students and the SWAT team members. If a SWAT
team member were killed, it would have given the killers access to
more weapons, a bulletproof vest and a radio on which they could
have heard police transmissions, Hinkle and Stone said.
</P>
<P>
   Shortly before 1 p.m., when the gunshots had subsided, SWAT
teams began sweeping through the building, carefully avoiding
explosives. But by then, the gunmen were already dead and so were
their classmates and teacher.

CONNECTICUT BEGINS CRUCIAL SOIL TESTS FOR STADIUM 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (a and s coding)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MEG VAILLANCOURT  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON -- Seeking to reassure the New England Patriots that
their proposed Hartford stadium site can be cleaned up on schedule,
Connecticut officials proudly proclaimed that drilling for required
soil tests finally began Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   But because at least one of the property owners will not allow
Connecticut's stadium development team onto the land, the drillers
have still not been able to begin the required tests on the full
site, sources said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   With only 11 days before the Patriots can decide to withdraw
from the Hartford deal without penalty, results of the full soil
tests will be a crucial factor in owner Robert Kraft's decision
about whether to go forward with the team's planned move to
Connecticut.
</P>
<P>
   ``At least one property owner won't let the drills on his land
unless the state either buys his property outright or indemnifies
him for future cleanup costs,'' the source said. ``And the state
has not been able to reach agreement on that parcel.''
</P>
<P>
   Even if the state is able to convince all of the property owners
to allow access to the full site within the next day or two,
written materials supplied by Connecticut's stadium development
team acknowledge that soil tests will take about eight weeks to
complete. And if portions of the site prove dirtier than
anticipated, cleaning it up could take longer.
</P>
<P>
   Since any delay threatens to throw off the state's agreement
that a new stadium will be available by the year 2002,
Connecticut's problems with site access could torpedo the contract
with Kraft.
</P>
<P>
   ``Given how much is at risk here, the Patriots need to have
soil-test results for every portion of the property, not just the
stadium footprint,'' the source said. ``Without it, the state's
ability to clean it up and the entire timetable for the project is
thrown into question.''
</P>
<P>
   A spokesman for Connecticut Governor John Rowland said Thursday
he ``wasn't aware'' of any problems regarding access to the stadium
site, but he said he was unable to confirm that all the property
owners had agreed to permit soil tests. Officials involved in the
actual site development process declined to comment about access to
the property.
</P>
<P>
   Connecticut's problems are a boon to a group of business
leaders, led by former Democratic National Committee chairman Paul
Kirk, who are working to keep the team in Massachusetts.
</P>
<P>
   The group is also working with National Football League
officials, including Commissioner Paul Tagliabue, who is coming to
Boston to meet with political and business leaders this week.
</P>
<P>
   Tagliabue's schedule is still being finalized, but he is
expected to meet with Governor Paul Cellucci, House Speaker Thomas
M. Finneran, Senate President Thomas F. Birmingham, and Boston
Mayor Thomas M. Menino Friday.
</P>
<P>
   Two other key NFL officials, including executive vice-president
Roger Goodell and Neil Glat, who as director of strategic
development is a specialist in new stadium development, will meet
with Bay State business leaders Thursday in anticipation of
Tagliabue's visit, NFL officials said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Finneran is the key player in determining whether the Kirk group
is successful in keeping the team here in Massachusetts. The
speaker's objections to a Senate plan that would have provided
roughly $70 million in public funds for a new Foxboro Stadium is
what led the Patriots to consider moving out of state.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, Kraft negotiated one of the richest stadium deals in
the history of the NFL in Connecticut. But business leaders who
hope to convince him to keep the team in Massachusetts note that he
worked extremely hard to remain in the Bay State before Finneran
drew a line in the sand on $57 million for public-funded
infrastructure costs.
</P>
<P>
   League officials are concerned about the impact the Patriots'
decision to leave Boston's sixth media market for Hartford's 26th
market may have on broadcast revenues. And the NFL recently changed
it rules to allow owners to retain a larger share of revenues to
help fund new stadium construction. But the League's assistance
would presumably come in the form of a loan.
</P>
<P>
   Before he was wooed by Connecticut, Kraft proposed building a
new $225 million stadium in Foxborough with his own money.
Observers now suggest that even a privately financed stadium could
work only if about $70 million in infrastructure improvements were
made to Route 1 to ensure fans have easy access to and from games.
The improvements are also crucial to marketing new luxury seats,
which would generate a significant portion of the revenues needed
to finance a new stadium.

TELECOM ITALIA AND DEUTSCHE TELEKOM REACH AGREEMENT ON MERGER 
</HEADLINE>
   (af)  
 By JOHN TAGLIABUE   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   ROME _ Two of Europe's largest telecommunications companies,
Telecom Italia SpA and Deutsche Telekom AG, reached a formal
agreement Wednesday night to merge in a share swap valued at nearly
$82 billion after the Italians obtained assurances that Germany
would not interfere in the new combined company's operations.
</P>
<P>
   The merger of the two former state-owned monopolies, which still
faces enormous obstacles, would be the biggest ever in Europe and
the second-biggest in history behind the $84 billion Exxon-Mobil
merger announced last year.
</P>
<P>
   The board of Telecom Italia approved the deal after the German
government, which still controls 72 percent of Deutsche Telekom's
shares, satisfied demands by Telecom Italia and offered written
assurance that it would not seek to influence the new combination's
business strategy and management.
</P>
<P>
   The merger, expected since Monday, would be the most
far-reaching in a recent wave of giant European combinations, as
companies maneuver to meet the challenges of globalization and
opening European economies.
</P>
<P>
   Details of the merger were to be announced at a news conference
on Thursday in London.
</P>
<P>
   The combined company would be the second-largest
telecommunications business in the world, with revenue of $63
billion surpassed only by the Nippon Telegraph and Telephone Corp.
It would create the world's largest local phone service provider
and one of the biggest mobile phone companies. It would have
roughly 240,000 employees and a strong presence in Europe, Asia and
Latin America, though not in the United States.
</P>
<P>
   ``Scale is the main advantage,'' said James Thomas, a
telecommunications consultant with Arthur Andersen &AMP; Co. in London.
``In principle, it makes sense. It follows the rules of
consolidation.''
</P>
<P>
   The merger is subject to the approval of shareholders and of
Italian, German and European Union regulators. The companies said
they would also seek Securities and Exchange Commission approval in
the United States, which is required because the companies intend
to list shares in the American stock market.
</P>
<P>
   The German and Italian governments are likely to approve, seeing
the deal as necessary in the face of liberalizing
telecommunications markets and global competition.
</P>
<P>
   Telecom Italia, in a statement, said the German and Italian
companies ``intend to integrate their activities giving life to the
world's second-largest telecommunication group.''
</P>
<P>
   The deal was sought earlier this year be Telecom Italia's tough
new chief executive, Franco Bernabe, essentially as a defensive
strategy to thwart a $65 billion hostile bid for Telecom Italia by
its main domestic rival, Olivetti SpA.
</P>
<P>
   Olivetti officials made clear Wednesday that they would continue
their bid and would seek approval from Italian securities
regulators on Thursday for documents to solicit shareholders.
</P>
<P>
   Olivetti has bid 11.50 euros ($12.25) a share in securities and
cash for Telecom Italia, versus securities valued at 12.02 euros a
share for Telecom Italia in the deal with Deutsche Telekom. But
Olivetti officials are hoping that the complexities of the rival
bid, its size and regulatory uncertainties will sway investors
toward Olivetti.
</P>
<P>
   Telecom Italia's board had tentatively approved the deal on
Tuesday night after two days of meetings but made final agreement
contingent on a pledge by the German government, which would
control about 45 percent of the combined company, to limit its
voting rights. Telecom Italia was taken public last year, though
the Italian government retains a 3.4 percent share.
</P>
<P>
   The Italian demand appeared to have been met earlier Wednesday
when Germany's finance minister, Hans Eichel, in a letter to the
Italian Treasury, which controls Rome's stake, expressed support
for the merger and said it was the German government's policy not
to interfere in how Deutsche Telekom was run.
</P>
<P>
   That policy, he said, would also apply to the merged company.
</P>
<P>
   Eichel said Germany intended to proceed with a previously
planned sale of Deutsche Telekom shares, though only at a pace that
would not upset equity markets.
</P>
<P>
   Telecom Italia said the deal involved an exchange of stock that
would give Deutsche Telekom shareholders a share of the combined
company for each share they now own, for 57 percent of the total.
For Telecom Italia, the exchange ratio is 1 new share for 3
ordinary shares or 5.61 nonvoting shares.
</P>
<P>
   If 90 percent of shareholders accept, the terms are sweetened
slightly to a ratio of 1 new share for every 2.9 ordinary Telecom
Italia shares, 5.5 nonvoting shares or 0.9 Deutsche Telekom share.
</P>
<P>
   Based on Deutsche Telekom's closing price of 36.08 euros
Wednesday, the deal values Telecom Italia's combined 5.26 billion
ordinary shares and 2.17 billion nonvoting shares at $81.8 billion.
</P>
<P>
   The value of the deal does not include the 40 percent of Telecom
Italia's mobile phone subsidiary that the Italian company does not
own. If the merged company were to buy that as well, the value of
the deal would rise substantially.
</P>
<P>
   The shares of the new company would be quoted in Frankfurt,
Milan and New York.
</P>
<P>
   Telecom Italia shares have been suspended most of the week on
the Milan exchange pending news of the merger, but the company's
American depository rights traded on Wall Street have been hurt on
investor skepticism that such a deal would work. Deutsche Telekom
has likewise suffered; its price closed down 1.4 percent in
Frankfurt Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   The deal will bring together two of Europe's toughest
executives. Bernabe, 50, took over Telecom Italia in a management
shake-up late last year, after turning around the big Italian
energy group, Eni. Under the merger pact, he would be one of two
joint chief executives with Ron Sommer, 49, the Deutsche Telekom
chief. Sommer has been advised by Goldman, Sachs; Telecom Italia's
advisers include J.P. Morgan and the Credit Suisse First Boston
unit of Credit Suisse Group.
</P>
<P>
   The merger plan, which stresses equality to satisfy Italian
political sentiments, despite Deutsche Telekom's larger size,
foresees a German corporation with a 10-member supervisory board,
to set company policy and appoint management, evenly split among
Italian and German representatives. The board's chairman will
alternate each year between Germany and Italy.
</P>
<P>
   If it proceeds, and full approval could take months, the deal
would have resounding effects through the industry. It was unclear
what name the company will bear, though German newspapers have
taken to calling it ``Telecom Transalpina.'' &QL;

 &HT;    Students say gunmen were ``full of hate''
 &HT;    By C. Patrick Cleary
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   LITTLETON, Colo. - They ate lunch alone under the stairs.
</P>
<P>
   They augmented the black trench coats with black lipstick, eye
shadow, black trousers and baseball caps.
</P>
<P>
   They increasingly kept to themselves this year. When they got
strikes during early morning bowling classes this spring they would
look at each other and do the Nazi salute.
</P>
<P>
   ``You guys, that is stupid,'' John House, a 17-year-old
Columbine High School junior, said he would tell Eric Harris and
Dylan Klebold when the two would give the Nazi salute at the
bowling alley. ``They would just look at me.''
</P>
<P>
   Harris and Klebold did not show up for bowling class on Tuesday
morning. House said it was hard not to notice. Those two and two
others, dressed in black, stuck together as if glued, he said.
</P>
<P>
   The jocks didn't like them. They didn't like the jocks.
</P>
<P>
   Witnesses said when they went into the school library carrying
guns, they ordered the ``jocks'' to stand up.
</P>
<P>
   When nobody stood, they announced that everybody wearing
baseball caps or clothing with sports logos would die, said Joshua
Lapp, a 16-year-old sophomore.
</P>
<P>
   They then carried out their own brand of sport.
</P>
<P>
   ``After they shot somebody they acted like it was a football
game and they won,'' said Lapp, who escaped the library after 45
horrifying minutes. ``After (people would) get shot they'd scream
and they'd keep shooting until they stopped screaming.''
</P>
<P>
   Harris used to be a jock. He played soccer for his first three
years at Columbine. He lived in a neighborhood near Chatfield
Reservoir, the epitome of suburban America. White sidewalks on
cul-de-sacs with two-story houses built in the 1980s.
</P>
<P>
   Klebold, too, lived in a neighborhood of more affluent standing.
</P>
<P>
   However, something went wrong between the blue jeans and white
T-shirts of last year and Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   They turned to black. They began to wear swastikas on their
backpacks.
</P>
<P>
   They listened to high-powered techno rock music from Germany and
proclaimed worship of Adolph Hitler, said Jon Vandermark, a
16-year-old sophomore.
</P>
<P>
   Some members of the group said they were bi-sexual, Vandemark
said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Boys would hold hands in the halls sometimes,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   They also attended classes. They were bright students who loved
to play video games. Acquaintances remembered them as quiet but
friendly.
</P>
<P>
   Many students said they knew both but not that well.
</P>
<P>
   Harris and Klebold's hatred brewed from a perception of being
outcasts, picked on, laughed at. They were called freaks, homos and
everything in-between.
</P>
<P>
   Junior Nicole Shieve watched as the two, and others in the
group, kept getting picked on during school.
</P>
<P>
   Harris and Klebold withdrew into a world few students
understood. The two emerged Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's not what they look like,'' 18-year-old Janine Roberts
said Wednesday morning as the 1998 high school yearbook pictures of
the two were flashed, again, on the television screen. ``Eric had
long, blond hair,'' she said. ``The other guy was just dirty
looking.''
</P>
<P>
   Roberts walked by the two as they entered the school just before
11:30 a.m. Tuesday and smiled at them. They smiled back. Before she
knew it, they had turned around and were shooting at her and her
friend outside the building.
</P>
<P>
   Roberts was not hit. A few seconds later a bomb exploded nearly
in her face.
</P>
<P>
   ``It didn't just happen,'' she said. ``It was intended. It was
planned.''
</P>
<P>
   Harris was small. Klebold was tall. Students couldn't really
decide if one was the leader and the other the follower.
</P>
<P>
   Their group, the ``Trench Coat Mafia,'' has reportedly been
around for a few years. Some say that it began to lose some of its
luster when many of the members graduated last year. Neither
Klebold nor Harris was in a photograph of the group in last year's
yearbook.
</P>
<P>
   One former student, Jessica, said she remembers how nice and
helpful Harris was last year. He made sure her day was going well.
The two spoke often during the year. Then during the summer, Harris
would show up where she worked about every other weekend. Everytime
something a bit
</P>
<P>
   different about him concerned her.
</P>
<P>
   Then came the trench coat.
</P>
<P>
   Then she no longer saw him.
</P>
<P>
   Junior Jesse Boyer said when Harris returned to school this
year, Boyer decided not to associate with him or Klebold. The
trench coats took the place of soccer.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was a jock for so long,'' Boyer said. ``Now he was into
Nazi stuff.''
</P>
<P>
   Klebold was a smart kid from a loving home, said Nick Baumgart,
a 17-year-old senior who was in the same Boy Scout group.
</P>
<P>
   But he changed and began to hang out with Harris, who Baumgart
described as violent.
</P>
<P>
   The two suspects hinted at a plan to ``do something for them to
remember us by,'' said Eric Veik, a 16-year-old student.
</P>
<P>
   ``I guess yesterday they just decided they weren't going to take
anymore crap and they got back,'' Veik said.
</P>
<P>
   ``They wanted to die,'' Roberts said. ``They were so full of
hate. You can't go to school with bombs and guns and expect to come
out alive. They were so full of hate to take everyone with them.''

CAN IT HAPPEN HERE? ACROSS U.S., SCHOOLS WONDER
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Ark., N.H., N.Y., Mass., Ohio, Texas, Wash.)  (rk) 
 By CAREY GOLDBERG   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ Flags flew at half-staff; moments of prayer silenced
the halls; special assemblies gathered. But even more than posting
outward signals of distress over the killings in Littleton, Colo.,
schools around the country turned inward Wednesday with an
intensity inspired by no previous school mayhem, seeking solace and
answers and assurance.
</P>
<P>
   At Pelham Memorial High School in Pelham, N.Y., the principal,
Robert G. Shillito, distributed a letter to teachers Wednesday
asking them to ``pause to consider whether such an event could
happen here in Pelham.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Can we be better `tuned in' to those disaffected students in
our school who may be potential candidates for such acts?'' the
letter asked.
</P>
<P>
   Students in one creative-writing class at Pelham Memorial
composed poems about the killings, including one by a junior,
Georgia Cool, that asked, ``Do I have to look in the faces of my
friends and see potential murders?''
</P>
<P>
   In Lynnwood, Wash., a suburb of Seattle, students at Meadowdale
High School asked that the flag be lowered Wednesday, and the staff
focused largely on ``asking the students what could we do to
prevent something like that from happening here,'' said Norm
Hoffman, the principal.
</P>
<P>
   Hoffman said the school was trying ``to encourage students to be
proactive in preventing such a tragedy here.''
</P>
<P>
   ``If they know someone being humiliated or put down,'' he said,
``how do we deal with that? And if we know someone has violent
tendencies, how do we report that?''
</P>
<P>
   An English teacher at Meadowdale, Melodee MacWilliams, went so
far as to give her class a list of all the students in it, and to
assign them to write something ``kind and gentle and loving'' about
each one.
</P>
<P>
   ``We talked about, what if someone sometime had just reached out
and said something great to one of these kids,'' she said,
referring to the Littleton killers. ``Would it have done something
great? Would it have made a difference? I had boys in my class with
tears in their eyes. They're getting it, that we are part of this
community, that we have responsibility for each other.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. MacWilliams said the class was also interested in
brainstorming to try to explain the school shootings, from access
to computers to home abuse and prejudices.
</P>
<P>
   At Buckingham, Browne and Nichols, an academically demanding
private school in Cambridge, Mass., similar searching went on
Wednesday afternoon at a meeting of perhaps 40 students who chose
to get together in the library ``quiet room'' and discuss the
Littleton shootings, said Morgan Meade, the dean of students.
</P>
<P>
   ``There was a fair amount of speculation about what would drive
someone to do something like that,'' Meade said. ``Is there a level
of anger or despair in students that they haven't experienced in
people they know? Is it a desire for fame or infamy? Is it the
parents of the people who do that, have they done something
wrong?''
</P>
<P>
   For his part, he said, ``I was saying that I thought probably
the most you could do was to try to recognize people who seemed to
be isolated and unhappy and connect to those people rather than
sort of responding to the vibes that those kids send out by pulling
away.''
</P>
<P>
   There was also some discussion of school safety, he said; as
there was in other schools like Indian Hill High School in
Cincinnati, where teachers gathered in part to get some extra
assurances on the school's ``intruder procedure.''
</P>
<P>
   In general, however, schools seemed to be largely prepared on
how to deal with major crises like shootings, already too familiar
with the issues from past school violence and generally already
fixed for crisis training and management. A few reported taking
extra precautions, watching out for copycats and increasing
patrols, but most already had safety procedures established in the
wake of past incidents.
</P>
<P>
   Rather, school reactions focused more on students' immediate
emotional well-being. Many reported issuing announcements that
counselors were available to all who wanted to talk. At Johnston
High School in Austin, Tex., the principal instructed social
studies teachers to discuss the shootings with students.
</P>
<P>
   Anthony Cardenas, a senior, broadcast a commentary on the high
school's closed-circuit television in which he told his fellow
students, ``All we can do is hope for the best for the families of
the dead and work our hearts out to make sure this doesn't happen
here, to us.''
</P>
<P>
   A similar theme resounded at Bishop Brady High School in
Concord, N.H., which barely escaped its own shooting this January.
A student brought a gun and 500 rounds of ammunition to the small
parochial school, and was reported to have had a list of students
and faculty members he intended to shoot. But he was arrested after
another student reported him, said the principal, Jean Barker.
</P>
<P>
   ``Yesterday, the kids here were listening to the news and all of
a sudden started thinking, `Oh, gracious, this is what we
avoided,'' she said. The school held an assembly about the
shootings and devoted a morning prayer to the citizens of
Littleton, she said.
</P>
<P>
   In Portsmouth, N.H., when the superintendent of public schools,
Suzanne Schrader, visited high school classes Wednesday morning,
every teacher was talking to students about the shootings, she
said, listening and offering support as they made remarks like, ``I
kept thinking, that could have been me, that could have been my
brother.''

 &HT;    High court is cautious in ADA case
 &HT;    By Bill Rankin
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ U.S. Supreme Court justices Wednesday expressed
concern that the high court may do more harm than good if it rules
in favor of two Georgia women in what is widely considered to be a
landmark civil rights case for the disabled.
</P>
<P>
   The court heard arguments on whether the Americans with
Disabilities Act prohibits the unnecessary institutionalization of
the mentally disabled if doctors say they are ready for release.
</P>
<P>
   The Georgia case was brought by Elaine Wilson and Lois Curtis,
two mentally disabled patients who sought release from Georgia
Regional Hospital in DeKalb County. They won lower court rulings
that require the state to pay for their mental health treatment in
a homelike setting, such as a group home.
</P>
<P>
   Both Wilson, 47, and Curtis, 31, came to Washington to hear
arguments on their case but were unable to get seats in the packed
courtroom.
</P>
<P>
   Outside the courthouse, more than 100 disability rights
activists, many in wheelchairs, rallied beneath huge banners that
read, ``Civil Rights Not States Rights'' and ``Don't Tread on the
ADA.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Go get 'em, Elaine!'' Marcie Roth, a member of ADAPT, a
disability rights group, yelled to Wilson as she walked away from
the courthouse. ``Free our people.''
</P>
<P>
   Several of the court's nine justices asked the women's attorney
for reassurance over the consequences of a court ruling that
requires states to move mentally disabled patients out of state
institutions and into community settings.
</P>
<P>
   ``What bothers me is writing something which, as it works out in
the real world, leaves many who need to be in institutions turned
out and abandoned on the streets,'' Justice Stephen Breyer said.
</P>
<P>
   Breyer said that an estimated 70,000 people are now being served
in state mental institutions nationwide. Many need to be there, he
said, and if the court requires states to move mental health
patients into community settings, many who need the institutional
services may be released, also.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm concerned about the possibilities,'' Justice John Paul
Stevens added. ``States, in order to avoid the risk of liability,
will push people out in that direction.''
</P>
<P>
   But Michael Gottesman, a Georgetown University law professor who
argued on behalf of Wilson and Curtis, said that mentally disabled
patients in state institutions can only be released when state
doctors say they are ready to go. And, in Wilson and Curtis' case,
state doctors had decided they should be released from Georgia
Regional, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``The overriding goal of the Americans With Disabilities Act is
to remove the barriers that prevent disabled people from gaining
access to the mainstream of society,'' Gottesman told the court.
</P>
<P>
   He added that if there is ever a dispute over whether a mental
health patient should be released from an institution, court
precedent dictates that the state's mental health experts be given
deference on that issue.
</P>
<P>
   Since their lawsuit was filed in 1995, both women have been
released from Georgia Regional. Wilson shares an apartment in
College Park with a roommate; Curtis lives in a group home in
Decatur.
</P>
<P>
   The case is the first of four the high court is considering this
month that will help define the legal boundaries of the Americans
With Disabilities Act. A decision in the Georgia case is expected
by late June.
</P>
<P>
   The ADA, signed into law in 1990, opened the workplace to
persons with disabilities and required the removal of the physical
barriers that inhibited their access to public facilities.
</P>
<P>
   A good portion of Wednesday's hourlong arguments involved
justices peppering attorneys with hypothetical questions as to what
constitutes actual discrimination under the law. But Justice Sandra
Day O'Connor sought to steer the arguments away from that and focus
on the exact meaning of a regulation that requires public services
and programs be offered ``in the most integrated setting
appropriate to the needs'' of people with disabilities.
</P>
<P>
   ``What this case actually turns on is the interpretation of the
regulation,'' O'Connor said. ``Isn't that what this boils down
to?''
</P>
<P>
   Patricia Downing, assistant attorney general for the state of
Georgia, agreed that it did and said Georgia believes that Title II
of the ADA ``applies to even-handed treatment of the handicapped as
opposed to the nonhandicapped.''
</P>
<P>
   To say it requires states to pay for the placements of mentally
disabled patients in community settings is too liberal an
interpretation of the law and not what it says, Downing said.
</P>
<P>
   Gottesman and Assistant Solicitor General Irving Gornstein,
representing the Clinton administration, told the justices that
Congress intended the ADA to be interpreted much more broadly.
</P>
<P>
   ``Isolation and segregation in an institution is a pervasive
form of discrimination,'' Gottesman said, adding that even the
state agrees that it is ``much, much more cheap to treat these
people in a community setting.

CONNECTICUT BEGINS CRUCIAL SOIL TESTS FOR STADIUM 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (a and s coding)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MEG VAILLANCOURT  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON -- Seeking to reassure the New England Patriots that
their proposed Hartford stadium site can be cleaned up on schedule,
Connecticut officials proudly proclaimed that drilling for required
soil tests finally began Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   But because at least one of the property owners will not allow
Connecticut's stadium development team onto the land, the drillers
have still not been able to begin the required tests on the full
site, sources said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   With only 11 days before the Patriots can decide to withdraw
from the Hartford deal without penalty, results of the full soil
tests will be a crucial factor in owner Robert Kraft's decision
about whether to go forward with the team's planned move to
Connecticut.
</P>
<P>
   ``At least one property owner won't let the drills on his land
unless the state either buys his property outright or indemnifies
him for future cleanup costs,'' the source said. ``And the state
has not been able to reach agreement on that parcel.''
</P>
<P>
   Even if the state is able to convince all of the property owners
to allow access to the full site within the next day or two,
written materials supplied by Connecticut's stadium development
team acknowledge that soil tests will take about eight weeks to
complete. And if portions of the site prove dirtier than
anticipated, cleaning it up could take longer.
</P>
<P>
   Since any delay threatens to throw off the state's agreement
that a new stadium will be available by the year 2002,
Connecticut's problems with site access could torpedo the contract
with Kraft.
</P>
<P>
   ``Given how much is at risk here, the Patriots need to have
soil-test results for every portion of the property, not just the
stadium footprint,'' the source said. ``Without it, the state's
ability to clean it up and the entire timetable for the project is
thrown into question.''
</P>
<P>
   A spokesman for Connecticut Governor John Rowland said Thursday
he ``wasn't aware'' of any problems regarding access to the stadium
site, but he said he was unable to confirm that all the property
owners had agreed to permit soil tests. Officials involved in the
actual site development process declined to comment about access to
the property.
</P>
<P>
   Connecticut's problems are a boon to a group of business
leaders, led by former Democratic National Committee chairman Paul
Kirk, who are working to keep the team in Massachusetts.
</P>
<P>
   The group is also working with National Football League
officials, including Commissioner Paul Tagliabue, who is coming to
Boston to meet with political and business leaders this week.
</P>
<P>
   Tagliabue's schedule is still being finalized, but he is
expected to meet with Governor Paul Cellucci, House Speaker Thomas
M. Finneran, Senate President Thomas F. Birmingham, and Boston
Mayor Thomas M. Menino Friday.
</P>
<P>
   Two other key NFL officials, including executive vice-president
Roger Goodell and Neil Glat, who as director of strategic
development is a specialist in new stadium development, will meet
with Bay State business leaders Thursday in anticipation of
Tagliabue's visit, NFL officials said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Finneran is the key player in determining whether the Kirk group
is successful in keeping the team here in Massachusetts. The
speaker's objections to a Senate plan that would have provided
roughly $70 million in public funds for a new Foxboro Stadium is
what led the Patriots to consider moving out of state.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, Kraft negotiated one of the richest stadium deals in
the history of the NFL in Connecticut. But business leaders who
hope to convince him to keep the team in Massachusetts note that he
worked extremely hard to remain in the Bay State before Finneran
drew a line in the sand on $57 million for public-funded
infrastructure costs.
</P>
<P>
   League officials are concerned about the impact the Patriots'
decision to leave Boston's sixth media market for Hartford's 26th
market may have on broadcast revenues. And the NFL recently changed
it rules to allow owners to retain a larger share of revenues to
help fund new stadium construction. But the League's assistance
would presumably come in the form of a loan.
</P>
<P>
   Before he was wooed by Connecticut, Kraft proposed building a
new $225 million stadium in Foxborough with his own money.
Observers now suggest that even a privately financed stadium could
work only if about $70 million in infrastructure improvements were
made to Route 1 to ensure fans have easy access to and from games.
The improvements are also crucial to marketing new luxury seats,
which would generate a significant portion of the revenues needed
to finance a new stadium.

 &HT;    1,058 kids in Georgia winners of tuition aid
 &HT;    By Doug Cumming
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Two of America's wealthiest businessmen will pay about
half the private school tuition for 1,058 of Georgia's poorer
children who were lucky enough to win the scholarships in a massive
national lottery announced Wednesday to promote the politics of
school choice.
</P>
<P>
   The media event at the New York Public Library, announcing the
selection of 40,000 of 1.25 million applicants for a total of $160
million over four years, highlighted the apparent hunger of many
low-income families to opt out of public schools they see as
disorderly, unnurturing and scary. The program, which pays for four
years of a child's education, represents a new type of corporate
investment in education, on the theory that marketlike competition
will shake up the lowest-performing public schools, especially in
inner cities.
</P>
<P>
   ``The old debate is over,'' said Ted Forstmann, a financier
known for corporate buyouts and chairman of the Children's
Scholarship Fund. ``These families have ended it. In anybody's book
this is a thunderous demonstration of dissatisfaction with the
present system _ and of the demand for alternatives.''
</P>
<P>
   The winners are not necessarily poor or dissatisfied. For
example, Gwendylon Smith, a corporate account executive for
BellSouth Entertainment in Atlanta, won a CSF scholarship for her
daughter Juanita, 6, a first-grader at Atlanta's Collier Heights
Elementary School. Smith will look into private schools with
tuitions ranging from $3,000 to more than $10,000, although
Juanita's scholarship will only be as much as $1,700. With the same
cap and a sliding scale of income restrictions, poorer families get
75 percent of tuition, wealthier families 25 percent. Parents must
contribute part of tuition _ on average, $1,000.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it's the American system, to have choice,'' Smith
said.
</P>

BORDERS' NEW CEO SUDDENLY QUITS 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Mich., Tenn., Fla.)  (bl)  
 By DOREEN CARVAJAL   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Just a little more than five months after boasting about hiring
Philip Pfeffer, a longtime book industry executive, as its chief
executive, Borders Group Inc. unceremoniously announced his abrupt
departure Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   The company, the second-largest bookseller in the nation after
Barnes &AMP; Noble, also said that its first-quarter earnings would be
4 cents to 5 cents a share, lower than analysts' estimates of 7
cents. On the news, shares of Borders fell $2.4375, or 14 percent,
to $14.625.
</P>
<P>
   Pfeffer's departure was so sudden and surprising that several
top executives were not even at the company's headquarters in Ann
Arbor, Mich., for the announcement. The executive who handles
investor relations was away, so the chief financial officer faxed
news releases describing what the company called Pfeffer's
resignation. The executive who deals with inquiries from the news
media was on vacation, so an independent agency fielded questions
about the management shuffle that resulted in Pfeffer's departure
and chairman Robert DiRomualdo's return as interim chief executive.
</P>
<P>
   ``Well, all I can say is that it just wasn't a good fit and we
want to move on,'' said DiRomualdo, declining to elaborate. Borders
said it would take a one-time after-tax charge of 4 cents a share
in connection with Pfeffer's resignation.
</P>
<P>
   As late as last week, Pfeffer was still seen as firmly in
charge, appearing at meetings to discuss detailed strategies for
the company's activities. Pfeffer, whose company voice mail was cut
off Wednesday, did not respond to messages left at his apartment in
Michigan or at his permanent home in Tennessee, where his family
has remained over the years since he left his position as chief
executive of Ingram Distribution Group to become president and
chief operating officer of Random House Inc. in New York and then
to head Borders.
</P>
<P>
   Borders hired Pfeffer in November, less than a week after its
rival, Barnes &AMP; Noble, announced a $600 million purchase of Ingram
Book Group, the nation's largest book distributor, which is part of
Ingram Distribution. With his knowledge of distribution and book
publishing, Pfeffer was seen as an able leader for Borders, which
is trying to catch up with the two leaders in electronic
bookselling, Amazon.com and Barnes &AMP; Noble.
</P>
<P>
   Still, Pfeffer came to Borders after clearly being passed over
for the chief executive's job at Random House when the company was
acquired by the media conglomerate Bertelsmann AG and joined with
Bantam Doubleday Dell. At Random House, he was criticized for
having a tendency to be a micromanager, but at Borders he had
barely had enough chance to absorb the company culture, since he
spent so much time traveling to its far-flung outposts.
</P>
<P>
   One Borders employee said the resignation came as a shock to
much of the corporate staff, but that there had been hints that
Pfeffer was being reined in by his bosses.
</P>
<P>
   For example, the employee said, in the winter, DiRomualdo, who
maintains a home in Florida, started attending more meetings along
with Pfeffer.
</P>
<P>
   After Wednesday's announcement, it was DiRomualdo who conducted
sessions with several hundred employees to explain management
changes, which also included the promotion of Cedric Vanzura as
president of Borders On-Line, and to detail strategies involving
the promotion of retail stores and the company's Web site
interchangeably.
</P>
<P>
   An employee who was there said Pfeffer's resignation did not
come up during the meeting, even though he had been an enthusiastic
supporter of the concept that the company likes to call ``retail
convergence.''
</P>
<P>
   DiRomualdo said in a telephone interview that he was prepared to
stay on as chief executive for as long as it takes for a new search
committee to find a leader with an ``open mind'' to preside over a
company with interests in both electronic commerce and retail
stores.
</P>
<P>
   Wednesday, analysts were hard pressed to evaluate what Pfeffer's
exit meant for the future of the company _ except that uncertainty
was not good for investors.
</P>
<P>
   Danielle Turnof Fox, an analyst at J.P. Morgan Securities, said
the changes highlighted the company's need to accelerate
``superstore growth and raise the visibility of Borders.com.'' But
that is a difficult task for anyone to achieve, she said, noting
that, given Pfeffer's short tenure, ``it would be very unfair to
blame him for coming in below expectations _ his job is not to
guide analysts to certain numbers.'' &QL;

ECONOMIC SCENE: UNEMPLOYMENT'S NATURAL RATE MAY HAVE A MIND OF ITS
OWN 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By MICHAEL M. WEINSTEIN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Economists are compulsive naysayers _ professionally dedicated
to tweaking anyone naive enough to overlook the fact that good
things have a cost and not all good things are affordable or
possible. This spinach-eating mentality partly explains why they
failed to predict the relentless good news in the 1990s, during
which the growth rate of productivity rose and unemployment and
inflation rates fell by half.
</P>
<P>
   That felicitous combination was supposed to be impossible.
Driving unemployment down was thought to drive inflation up, and
economists ridiculed anyone, especially politicians, who denied the
vicious trade-off. By the end of the decade, economists find
themselves without an explanation of high productivity or low
unemployment, the keys to economic prosperity.
</P>
<P>
   A discipline in crisis? Not really. Just because economists,
like physicists, do not have a Theory of Everything, that doesn't
mean they cannot explain a lot about what has happened in the 1990s
_ such as the increasing concentration on unemployment rolls of
people who are permanently out of work.
</P>
<P>
   Economies change, with academic theories following close behind.
In the 1930s, Keynes taught the profession that government could
spend its way out of a recession. True enough, but the sense that
economists could manage endless prosperity did not survive the
rising inflation of the 1960s wartime economy. Tight labor markets
led to rising wages, which, in turn, led to higher prices. Paul
Samuelson and Robert Solow of the Massachusetts Institute of
Technology taught the profession the logic of the Phillips curve,
the inescapable trade-off between unemployment and inflation.
</P>
<P>
   But even that formulation proved overly optimistic. Inflation in
the economy, propelled by loose monetary policy, did not just jump
to a higher level and stay there. Inflation accelerated, rising to
higher rates each year. Economists began to preach a tougher
message. There was, alas, no permanent trade-off between inflation
and unemployment. If government tried to drive unemployment below
its so-called natural rate, it would accelerate inflation,
threatening monetary stability and eventually forcing the Federal
Reserve to crack down. Enter Paul Volcker, the Fed chairman who
broke the back of the 1970s inflation spiral by throwing the
economy in deep recession (and throwing President Jimmy Carter out
of office).
</P>
<P>
   Economists forever warn against advice by Pollyannas who urge
the Fed to stimulate and then stimulate some more. The natural rate
dictates how far the Fed could go in generating jobs. By the end of
the 1980s, some economists thought the natural rate hovered around
7 percent. Others argued for 6 or 6.5 percent. Liberals hoped for 5
percent. Almost no one thought it could be any lower.
</P>
<P>
   Until now. Last year joblessness fell to 4.5 percent. Some
economists called on the Fed to tighten monetary policy to ward off
inflation before it could take hold. Alan Greenspan, the Fed
chairman, chose instead to wait for inflation to rise before he
cracked down. It did not, so he did not.
</P>
<P>
   Today, unemployment is under 4.5 percent and inflation is
 &UR; falling &LR; .
</P>
<P>
   Professor Robert J. Gordon of Northwestern University attributes
much of the favorable inflation data to special events of no
long-term significance _ falling food, oil, import and medical
costs.
</P>
<P>
   Professors Alan Krueger and Robert Shimer of Princeton and
Lawrence Katz of Harvard estimate that the natural rate probably
fell by about 1 percentage point, in part because of the aging and
growing stability of the labor force and the rising use of
temporary workers by employers.
</P>
<P>
   The largely unnoticed lesson of the Katz-Krueger data is that
almost the entire drop in unemployment, from around 9 percent early
in the decade to under 4.5 percent now, is from the ranks of the
short-term unemployed. Students, spouses and laid-off workers find
jobs quickly. Those who remain unemployed are people who have a
hard time finding work at all, presumably because they have a
physical or mental limitation.
</P>
<P>
   This finding colors policy responses. Temporarily unemployed
people need job-search assistance. The economically disadvantaged
need expensive training and government subsidies.
</P>
<P>
   Solow and Krueger, under the auspices of the Russell Sage
Foundation and the Century Foundation, are putting together a team
of economists to pursue the unanswered questions. How low is the
sustainable rate of unemployment, and can monetary and fiscal
policies maintain it or push it even lower?
</P>
<P>
   As for monetary policy, says Professor Robert Hall of Stanford,
``the 1990s have taught central bankers here and abroad that the
best policy is to set clear targets for inflation and stick by
them.'' The task is hard because monetary policy operates with long
lags. That means the Fed must make predictions about the state of
the economy a year into the future. One, but hardly the only,
factor in that prediction is where the Fed thinks the unemployment
rate is relative to the natural rate.
</P>
<P>
   But with or without knowledge of the elusive natural rate, the
Fed can and does make continual assessment of inflationary
pressures. Professor Hall argues that if the Fed convinces traders
in financial markets that inflation will be low and steady, the
economy will gravitate toward the lowest possible unemployment
rate.
</P>
<P>
   Smart policy, by this argument, reveals the natural rate. Smart
policy does not, Hall says, need prior knowledge of the natural
rate. That may be the most optimistic spin on policy making since
Keynes. &QL;

FOR SCHOOL MISFITS, `JOCKS' FREQUENTLY THE ENEMY

<P>
   It is a cliche of every high school sports movie from ``Peggy
Sue Got Married'' to ``Varsity Blues.'' Think of bully Biff in
``Back to the Future.'' Every day students are jealous and afraid
of the football stars. Too often, the student-athlete elites make
matters worse by teasing the weak, the pimply, and the uncool.
</P>
<P>
   But there is nothing cliche about murder in a high school
corridor, and for the first time there's a hint that the
traditional scholastic caste system may have played a part the
killing spree that left 15 dead at Columbine High School in
Littleton, Colo.
</P>
<P>
   While officials counted bodies and spoke of ``outcast'' boys,
our nation wondered about some of the preverse motivation behind
this latest act of bloodshed. To the best of anyone's recollection,
this was the first time ``jocks'' were cited as targets in a school
carnage.
</P>
<P>
   It appears that members of the now-infamous ``Trenchcoat Mafia''
hated minorities and may have chosen the anniversary of Adolph
Hitler's birth for the date of their shooting spree. But a new
wrinkle surfaced as student survivors spoke of the rebel group's
hatred for the boys and girls who starred in sports.
</P>
<P>
   Listen to the young voices of Columbine survivors:
</P>
<P>
   Nada Alami, a freshman, said, ``All I know is that they hate
jocks and stuff.'' Senior Denee Taylor said, ``They got picked on
all the time by the jocks and other people, saying things like `Why
do you wear black? Can't you change your clothes?' I heard (one
suspect) shot a black guy right in the face, and that they went
after other jocks.''
</P>
<P>
   Andrew Beard told CNN's Larry King that Trenchcoat members
``talked about how jocks, how all the football players, were in a
world of their own, thinking they were on top of everything and
nothing mattered to them.''
</P>
<P>
   According to witnesses, during the attack, one of the killers
yelled, ``All jocks stand up! We're going to kill every one of
you.''
</P>
<P>
   Doctor Albert J. Petitpas, director of the Athletic Counseling
Program at Springfield (Mass.) College, said, ``Often athletes are
seen as an over-privileged minority. They get the glory and the
tangible rewards. They have the most revered status among their
peers and you can imagine a group feeling alienated would resent
that.''
</P>
<P>
   High schools are divided into cliques of jocks, cheerleaders,
A-students, average kids, criminals, and misfits. Rent ``The
Breakfast Club.'' It's the definitive cinematic explanation of
American high school strata. Gathering one specimen from each
clique _ like some kind of high school Noah _ a detention
supervisor punishes a wrestler, a prom queen, a brain, a
delinquent, and a disheveled girl who appears incapable of uttering
a declarative sentence. The students know that the teacher sees
only the stereotype, not the person. This is how kids get labeled.
It is the genesis of the self-fullfilling prophecy that plagues so
many of our young people.
</P>
<P>
   What happened in Littleton can never be explained or justified,
but it appears to be the ultimate act of revenge from a group that
felt ridiculed, excluded, and bullied.
</P>
<P>
   One Columbine student described the Trenchcoat Mafia as,
``nerds, geeks, and dweebs trying to find someplace to fit in.''
Another student, Bree Pasquale, who narrowly escaped death, said,
``He just put a gun to my head and asked us if we wanted to die.
(He) started laughing and said, `I'm doing this because people made
fun of me last year.' ''
</P>
<P>
   It would appear that some athletes were shot because they were
among the ones who bullied the weak.
</P>
<P>
   Doctor Judy Van Raalte, an associate professor of psychology at
Springfield (with a specialty in sport psychology), said, ``There's
no research database for this, but I think student- athletes can
become targets, and there are several reasons. They are seen as
privleged. They have the clothing and the uniforms and the
letterjacket. Sometimes there's special considerations regarding
schoolwork. They are part of a high visibility clique. Sometimes
there's a certain cockiness, or a way of treating other students
which could contribute to it. This is not true of all athletes, but
it is true of some.''
</P>
<P>
   Celtic guard Ron Mercer, who graduated from Oak Hill Academy
(boys and girls) in Virginia in 1995, said, ``I didn't experience
that sort of thing. Maybe because it was a private school. I didn't
feel we had that many cliques. But certain people, certain athletes
carried themselves in a different way and maybe in this case, these
guys took it out on all the athletes as a group.''
</P>
<P>
   Philadelphia 76er veteran Rick Mahorn, a product of Weaver High
School in Hartford, Conn., said, ``I was more of a student in high
school. I didn't even play basketball until my senior year. But
it's not athletes and non-athletes. People are people, man.''
</P>
<P>
   High schools will always have cliques. It's been going on since
long before poodle skirts, burger stands and jukeboxes. Jocks rule.
Jocks are cool. And sometimes jocks are cruel. Meanwhile, kids who
might grow up to become Bill Gates are nerds. At a vulnerable age,
they are made to feel weak, stupid, and ugly. But no one was
prepared for this, and no one can excuse it.
</P>
<P>
   Before Tuesday, the cliques were just stupid and mean, an awful
part of high school life. But then came the bloodshed, the heinous
revenge of the nerds.
</P>
<P>
   No lesson here. We already knew that size, speed, and muscle are
no match for sawed-off shotguns, semi-automatic rifles, and
handguns.

IBM REPORTS A 41% RISE IN ITS PROFIT
</HEADLINE>
   (nk) 
 By LAWRENCE M. FISHER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   In another sign of continued health for high-technology makers,
IBM reported first-quarter earnings Wednesday that were well in
excess of analysts' estimates. IBM said its results were led by
strong sales of services and software, which accounted for 60
percent of gross profit.
</P>
<P>
   Shares of IBM, which reported its results after the end of
regular trading, closed at $171.875, up $2.125, on the New York
Stock Exchange. But IBM soared in after-hours dealings, gaining
more than $17 to trade at $189.375.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts said that IBM's results, coupled with the Microsoft
Corp.'s strong performance on Tuesday, should counter the gloomy
outlook painted for technology makers this quarter after the Compaq
Computer Corp. predicted, and delivered, half the earnings forecast
and the Intel Corp. reported sales growth that was less than
expected.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is just what the tech doctor ordered,'' said John B.
Jones Jr., an analyst with Solomon Smith Barney. IBM's service
business, intellectual property and distribution put it in a
different class than Compaq, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Compaq has many of the same pieces, but not the same
quality,'' Jones said. ``Compaq addresses the world from a
PC-centric standpoint. IBM addresses it from a customer-service
standpoint.''
</P>
<P>
   Though some analysts said IBM's better-than-expected results
reflected the company's ability to manage expectations, they also
pointed to a growing division between leaders and laggards in the
technology industries. IBM has been able to position traditional
strengths in data base management software and large servers as
essential tools for electronic commerce.
</P>
<P>
   The company's huge consulting practice is also riding the
Internet wave as customers rush to offer good and services on the
World Wide Web.
</P>
<P>
   Other computer companies that have established a strong Internet
identity, like Apple Computer and Sun Microsystems, also reported
stronger-than-expected results this quarter.
</P>
<P>
   Sun's shares have fallen, however, after the company warned that
sales might slow in the second half of the year if companies defer
technology purchases because of Year 2000 concerns. That same
warning was issued in an extremely strong earnings report on
Tuesday by Microsoft, and its stock also closed down slightly
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   For the quarter, IBM reported earnings of $1.47 billion, or
$1.55 a diluted share, up 41 percent from $1.04 billion, or $1.06 a
share, in the comparable period a year earlier. Revenue rose 17
percent, to $8.58 billion, from $7.32 billion in the first quarter
of 1998.
</P>
<P>
   Per-share figures reflect a decrease in the average number of
shares outstanding, to 911.9 million compared with 950.2 million in
the first quarter of 1998. IBM spent approximately $2.1 billion on
share repurchases in the first quarter, up from $1.6 billion in the
final quarter of 1998.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts expected IBM to earn $1.41 a share, according to First
Call, which tracks such estimates. It was the 12th consecutive
quarter in which IBM has exceeded estimates.
</P>
<P>
   ``We started 1999 with a strong quarter,'' Louis V. Gerstner
Jr., IBM's chairman and chief executive, said in a statement. ``We
saw a significant improvement in our business in Asia, and we also
had double-digit revenue growth in Europe and the Americas.
Services is clearly the largest and fastest-growing portion of the
information technology industry, and we continue to extend our
leadership position each quarter.''
</P>
<P>
   IBM said said sales in the Americas increased 13 percent, to
$8.8 billion; in Europe, the Middle East and Africa by 20 percent,
to $6.3 billion; and in the Asia-Pacific region, 20 percent, to
$3.5 billion.
</P>
<P>
   Hardware sales were up 17 percent, services were up 19 percent,
and software up 10 percent. IBM said it signed $9.8 billion in
services contracts in the first quarter and concluded the quarter
with a total services contract backlog around $55 billion.
</P>
<P>
   In a telephone conference call with securities analysts, Douglas
Maine, IBM's chief financial officer, said that personal computer
sales were up 50 percent, a ``significant improvement.'' However,
IBM continues to lose money on PC sales, which contributed to an
overall decline in the company's gross profit margin.
</P>
<P>
   In response to analysts' questions about slowing growth for
information technology in the second half of the year, possibly due
to Year 2000 issues, Maine said he did not see that.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's an absence of anything we're hearing from customers
that suggests a slowdown,'' he said. ``The IT sector in 1999 will
continue to be the key driver'' of worldwide growth in economic
output.

   Nada Alami, a freshman, said, ``All I know is that they hate
jocks and stuff.'' Senior Denee Taylor said, ``They got picked on
all the time by the jocks and other people, saying things like `Why
do you wear black? Can't you change your clothes?' I heard (one
suspect) shot a black guy right in the face, and that they went
after other jocks.''
</P>
<P>
   Andrew Beard told CNN's Larry King that Trenchcoat members
``talked about how jocks, how all the football players, were in a
world of their own, thinking they were on top of everything and
nothing mattered to them.''
</P>
<P>
   According to witnesses, during the attack, one of the killers
yelled, ``All jocks stand up! We're going to kill every one of
you.''
</P>
<P>
   Doctor Albert J. Petitpas, director of the Athletic Counseling
Program at Springfield (Mass.) College, said, ``Often athletes are
seen as an over-privileged minority. They get the glory and the
tangible rewards. They have the most revered status among their
peers and you can imagine a group feeling alienated would resent
that.''
</P>
<P>
   High schools are divided into cliques of jocks, cheerleaders,
A-students, average kids, criminals, and misfits. Rent ``The
Breakfast Club.'' It's the definitive cinematic explanation of
American high school strata. Gathering one specimen from each
clique _ like some kind of high school Noah _ a detention
supervisor punishes a wrestler, a prom queen, a brain, a
delinquent, and a disheveled girl who appears incapable of uttering
a declarative sentence. The students know that the teacher sees
only the stereotype, not the person. This is how kids get labeled.
It is the genesis of the self-fullfilling prophecy that plagues so
many of our young people.
</P>
<P>
   What happened in Littleton can never be explained or justified,
but it appears to be the ultimate act of revenge from a group that
felt ridiculed, excluded, and bullied.
</P>
<P>
   One Columbine student described the Trenchcoat Mafia as,
``nerds, geeks, and dweebs trying to find someplace to fit in.''
Another student, Bree Pasquale, who narrowly escaped death, said,
``He just put a gun to my head and asked us if we wanted to die.
(He) started laughing and said, `I'm doing this because people made
fun of me last year.' ''
</P>
<P>
   It would appear that some athletes were shot because they were
among the ones who bullied the weak.
</P>
<P>
   Doctor Judy Van Raalte, an associate professor of psychology at
Springfield (with a specialty in sport psychology), said, ``There's
no research database for this, but I think student- athletes can
become targets, and there are several reasons. They are seen as
privleged. They have the clothing and the uniforms and the
letterjacket. Sometimes there's special considerations regarding
schoolwork. They are part of a high visibility clique. Sometimes
there's a certain cockiness, or a way of treating other students
which could contribute to it. This is not true of all athletes, but
it is true of some.''
</P>
<P>
   Celtic guard Ron Mercer, who graduated from Oak Hill Academy
(boys and girls) in Virginia in 1995, said, ``I didn't experience
that sort of thing. Maybe because it was a private school. I didn't
feel we had that many cliques. But certain people, certain athletes
carried themselves in a different way and maybe in this case, these
guys took it out on all the athletes as a group.''
</P>
<P>
   Philadelphia 76er veteran Rick Mahorn, a product of Weaver High
School in Hartford, Conn., said, ``I was more of a student in high
school. I didn't even play basketball until my senior year. But
it's not athletes and non-athletes. People are people, man.''
</P>
<P>
   High schools will always have cliques. It's been going on since
long before poodle skirts, burger stands and jukeboxes. Jocks rule.
Jocks are cool. And sometimes jocks are cruel. Meanwhile, kids who
might grow up to become Bill Gates are nerds. At a vulnerable age,
they are made to feel weak, stupid, and ugly. But no one was
prepared for this, and no one can excuse it.
</P>
<P>
   Before Tuesday, the cliques were just stupid and mean, an awful
part of high school life. But then came the bloodshed, the heinous
revenge of the nerds.
</P>
<P>
   No lesson here. We already knew that size, speed, and muscle are
no match for sawed-off shotguns, semi-automatic rifles, and
handguns.

 &HT;    Coke profit down 13% for quarter
 &HT;    By Henry Unger
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WILMINGTON, Del. _ Coca-Cola Co., suffering its first quarterly
decline in case sales in more than a decade, reported Wednesday a
13 percent drop in first-quarter profits.
</P>
<P>
   ``We realize our short-term performance is not what you're used
to and not what you expect,'' Chairman M. Douglas Ivester told 600
shareholders at its annual meeting here. ``It does mark a rare
occurrence.''
</P>
<P>
   The company, which has been hit hard by recessions in many parts
of the globe, actually earned a penny more per share than Wall
Street analysts had been predicting.
</P>
<P>
   As a result, the company's stock climbed 3.5 percent Wednesday
on the New York Stock Exchange.
</P>
<P>
   Coca-Cola earned $747 million, or 30 cents a share, vs. $857
million, or 34 cents a share, in the first quarter of last year.
Net operating revenue fell 1 percent to $4.4 billion.
</P>
<P>
   Unit case volume, defined as the number of 24 eight-ounce
servings sold by bottlers to retailers, also dropped 1 percent
worldwide. Last year, by contrast, it rose 14 percent in the first
quarter.
</P>
<P>
   ``Coke is weathering one of the more difficult macroeconomic
environments it has seen in over a decade,'' said Morgan Stanley
Dean Witter analyst Andrew Conway. ``We'll get one more challenging
quarter, and then I think there will be some volume and earnings
growth, which will lead to better stock price performance.''
</P>
<P>
   By the end of the year, Conway predicts the stock will rise to
$75 a share. He thinks worldwide volume growth will be flat in the
second quarter after rising 10 percent in the year-ago period.
</P>
<P>
   Then, he said, worldwide volume will rise 3 percent to 4 percent
in the third quarter and 5 percent to 6 percent in the fourth
quarter.
</P>
<P>
   ``Coca-Cola still vigorously supports their business around the
globe, which tells you they're managing the process, instead of
having the process manage them,'' said Marty Romm, an analyst with
Credit Suisse First Boston.
</P>
<P>
   While volume grew 1.5 percent in the United States in the first
quarter, it was hurt by rising prices.
</P>
<P>
   ``There was some short-term consumer sticker shock,'' said John
Sicher, editor and publisher of Beverage Digest. But he expects
U.S. volume to increase in the next two quarters after consumers
get used to the higher prices, which averaged about 2 percent in
the first quarter.
</P>
<P>
   By contrast, Coca-Cola and its bottlers are reducing prices in
Brazil and Russia, where turbulent economies are hurting case
sales.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are monitoring consumer behavior and adapting our
tactics,'' Ivester told shareholders at the uneventful, 90-minute
annual meeting, where there were few negative comments.
</P>
<P>
   ``Even though global economic conditions are dampening our
volume and earnings growth during the first part of this year, our
long-term growth potential remains unchanged,'' Ivester said. ``Our
system has never been better equipped to convert that potential
into long-term value.''
</P>
<P>
   Analysts predict Coca-Cola will earn $1.40 a share in 1999,
which would be the same as last year, or higher by a penny or two.

 &HT;    Lighten up packaging to cut down on trash
 &HT;    By Eric Sundquist
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ On this Earth Day, there's finally a good answer to
the old checkout-line question: ``Paper or plastic?''
</P>
<P>
   The answer: ``It doesn't matter.''
</P>
<P>
   At least it doesn't matter very much, environmentally speaking.
The kind of grocery bag you choose is far less important than what
you put into it. Boxes, bottles, cans and other heavy packaging are
the real landfill cloggers.
</P>
<P>
   By choosing just 10 common consumer products with lightweight
packaging, the average household can keep up to 286 pounds of
packaging a year out of the trash, the Michigan-based environmental
group Use Less Stuff reports.
</P>
<P>
   Buying a breakfast cereal in a plastic bag rather than a
bag-lined box, for example, would save that household nearly nine
pounds a year. Buying soft drinks in plastic bottles instead of
boxed aluminum cans would save 19 pounds.
</P>
<P>
   One of the group's related conclusions runs counter to
conventional wisdom. ULS urges shoppers to buy the lightest, most
flexible packaging _ even if it's not recyclable. ``Light makes
right,'' declares ULS newsletter editor Robert M. Lilienfeld.
</P>
<P>
   That's because heavy, rigid packaging, such as glass bottles,
requires more energy to make and to truck to stores. Recycling
requires even more energy _ if the material gets recycled at all.
Compared to a heavy bottle, a light _ unrecyclable _ juice box is
cheaper to ship and takes up less landfill space.
</P>
<P>
   Many lighter-packaged goods also are cheaper. Cereal in a bag
would save a family $65 a year compared with cereal in a box.
</P>
<P>
   Through most this century, manufacturers have increased
packaging with their products, in part to make the products more
attractive on store shelves.
</P>
<P>
   But some have cut back. Lilienfeld cites Proctor &AMP; Gamble as a
leader in reducing packaging on laundry products, such as Tide
detergent, which it sells in lightweight ``refill'' bags and
bottles. For those still troubled by paper vs. plastic, Lilienfeld
has this advice: If you live near a waterway, go with paper, so
plastic won't accidentally end up in the water. If you're
land-locked, the environmental harm is less with plastic bags _
particularly if you use them to avoid buying trash-can liners.

USC GOLFER ROSALES TAKES ON PAC-10
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By SCOTT WOLF  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ It's hidden from view most of the time, two
dolphins blissfully swimming together on Jennifer Rosales' right
shoulder.
</P>
<P>
   Like most things, Rosales simply decided she wanted a tattoo and
got it. No questions asked.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wanted to get one and feel the pain of getting one. I almost
died,'' Rosales said. ``I think my mom will freak out if she finds
out.''
</P>
<P>
   Probably no more or less than USC's golf coaches would if they
knew their franchise player has already gone bungee jumping and
identified skydiving as her next pursuit.
</P>
<P>
   They were already uneasy when Rosales went skiing for the first
time last month, right in the middle of golf season, and bruised
her leg.
</P>
<P>
   ``She's very adventurous. She'll try everything,'' said her
sister, Michelle. ``She wants to go skydiving but I won't let
her.''
</P>
<P>
   Rosales, and her go-for-broke attitude, is not your typical
golfer. And that's partly why she has become one of the best in
college.
</P>
<P>
   ``She's not thinking knock it close to the pin,'' USC women's
golf coach Andrea Gaston said. ``She's thinking about knocking it
in.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Coach will usually tell me to just lay it up,'' Rosales said.
``I say, `No, I'm going to go for it.' I'm a gutsy player.''
</P>
<P>
   It's hard to argue with Rosales' success. Certainly, few
20-year-old college golfers have experienced her fame. A native of
the Philippines, she was regarded as a national hero even before
she won the 1998 NCAA individual championship.
</P>
<P>
   Newspapers refer to her as the ``queen of Asia's fairway,'' or
the ``darling of the president,'' because former president Fidel
Ramos is among her admirers.
</P>
<P>
   She won the country's amateur championship five straight times
between the ages of 14-19, and has won tournaments in China,
Malaysia and Hong Kong. Although she loves the attention, she has
to become a completely different person when she returns to the
Philippines.
</P>
<P>
   ``Back home, I have to dress up every time I go out. Here, I
dress any way I want,'' Rosales said. ``Here, I can be myself.
Nobody is watching me.''
</P>
<P>
   The native press can also be unforgiving if Rosales performs
below expectations. She learned that lesson in December, when she
unexpectedly lost the country's amateur championship.
</P>
<P>
   ``The press gave me a hard time. They said I gained weight,''
Rosales said. Newspaper stories referred to her as ``Chunky
Jennifer,'' although she weighs only about 120 pounds.
</P>
<P>
   ``They love me or hate me. It was pretty tough to deal with.''
</P>
<P>
   USC has had no complaints with Rosales. She is ranked No. 2 in
the country in the Collegiate Golf Rankings, and will try to win
her first Pacific-10 individual title beginning today at Stanford.
Next month, she will try to defend her NCAA title in Tulsa, Okla.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can't even believe it right now. It's still like a dream
come true,'' Rosales said about winning the championship last year.
</P>
<P>
   The title capped a stressful season for Rosales. She left her
family for the first time when she enrolled at USC last spring.
Once she arrived, she had to balance academics with playing golf
for USC, while also trying to fulfill commitments playing for her
country.
</P>
<P>
   At one point, she nearly went back home.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought, I'm just going to die,'' Rosales said. ``My first
semester was pretty hard. I'm glad I stayed or there would have
been no NCAA championship for me.''
</P>
<P>
   One reason Rosales remained is her sister. Michelle had already
moved to Southern California, and provided support and a familiar
face.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a very big adjustment,'' Michelle said. ``We're pampered
in the Philippines. We had like three or four nannies to do
everything. She had to learn to cook, to wash her clothes. She had
to adjust pretty fast.''
</P>
<P>
   To everything except school, that is. Rosales plans to turn pro
after the NCAA championships, even though her sister and Gaston
would prefer she return for her junior season.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm so done,'' Rosales said. ``My career is golf. I can't
picture myself sitting down at a computer. It's just not me. I'd
rather teach golf.''
</P>
<P>
   Rosales is so consumed by the sport that she named her cat
Slice. And one of her dogs is named O.B., or out of bounds.
</P>
<P>
   Gaston thinks Rosales would benefit from another year at USC
before joining the LPGA tour, but knows that her star player is
virtually guaranteed endorsement deals because of her popularity at
home and her NCAA title-winning performance.
</P>
<P>
   ``Jennifer just loves golf. She has not seen the value of
education for herself,'' Gaston said. ``I don't feel the value of
education in her country is being totally encouraged. But I
remember when you're 20 years old, you don't always listen.''
</P>
<P>
   Rosales admits she is easily distracted and doesn't have the
discipline to be a dedicated student.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sometimes, I have a hard time saying no,'' Rosales said.
``Even if I have plans to study and someone says let's go out, I
say, `OK, I'm in.'''
</P>
<P>
   There are advantages to this mindset. Rosales does not get
intimidated by other golfers and says she almost never gets nervous
on the course. Other golfers have actually been afraid of her when
she wears her trademark black shoes and Oakley sunglasses.
</P>
<P>
   ``To tell you the truth, I play good when I'm under pressure.
I'm in a zone.I was dealing with pressure since I was 13. That
helped me a lot,'' Rosales said. ``When I'm at the tee box, I feel
I'm on top of the world. No one can intimidate me.''

CARTOON LIKELY TO AID THQ EARNINGS, ANALYSTS SAY
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
BY BEN SULLIVAN  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   CALABASAS, Calif. -- ``Rugrats,'' wrestling and higher revenues
are expected to provide a 32 percent boost to videogame maker THQ
Inc.'s first quarter earnings due out today.
</P>
<P>
   A consensus of analysts surveyed by First Call Corp. expects the
Calabasas-based company to earn 75 cents per share, on sales of
approximately $72 million, compared to 57 cents per share in the
like period one year ago.
</P>
<P>
   THQ develops and publishes titles for Sony, Sega and Nintendo
game consoles. Though best known for its World Championship
Wrestling games, the company last year lost that lucrative license
in a bidding war to competitor Electronic Arts and has since
shifted much of its resources to other titles, including games
based on the popular ``Rugrats'' children's television program.
</P>
<P>
   Under its contract with WCW, THQ must stop marketing games with
the well-known label this summer. But the gamemaker has already
signed a deal with the smaller World Wrestling Federation to market
games featuring that group's characters beginning in November.
</P>
<P>
   THQ's stock is trading at a lower multiple of earnings than
other companies in its sector, in part because of concern over the
loss of the WCW license, which at one point accounted for more than
two-thirds of the company's sales. THQ shares have a
price-to-earnings ratio of 16.6, compared to an industry average of
just under 30. But analyst Anthony Gikas at U.S. Bancorp Piper
Jaffray said such investor worry is misplaced.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you look back at 1997 and 1998, THQ published two wrestling
games a year, one at the start and one just before the holiday
season,'' Gikas said. ``They're doing exactly the same thing this
year.''
</P>
<P>
   Gikas, like most of the seven analysts following THQ, considers
the stock at its current price to represent a buying opportunity.
THQ shares closed up 62.5 cents Wednesday at $23.50.

NEWHALL LAND'S EARNINGS PREDICTED TO BE PLEASING

<P>
   VALENCIA, Calif. -- Analysts expect few surprises when The
Newhall Land and Farming Company, Santa Clarita's predominant
developer, releases its quarterly earnings today.
</P>
<P>
   Sutro and Co. Inc., the only research firm that actively tracks
Newhall Land, estimates the Valencia-based company will post
earnings of 26 cents per partnership unit for the quarter the ended
March 31.
</P>
<P>
   The company posted earnings of just 1 cent a share in the first
quarter of last year, but a major land sale accounted for almost
all of this quarter's expected increase.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're on track for an excellent 1999,'' company spokeswoman
Marlee Lauffer said Wednesday. ``We're continuing to experience
strong activity in every area of our business.''
</P>
<P>
   Most of those earnings are the result of the March sale of
Newhall Land's last large parcel in Cowell Ranch, a developing area
of Northern California. Company officials said the $10.5 million
sale would contribute about $8 million, or 24 cents a partnership
unit, to quarterly earnings.
</P>
<P>
   Newhall Land partnership units -- which trade like stock but do
not grant voting rights -- were up 25 cents to $26.875 Wednesday.
The units have been boosted in recent days by a general upswing
among real estate stocks.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think they're on track,'' said analyst Katherine Flores, a
Sutro and Co. associate. ``I expect it to continue with the rest of
the real estate recovery.''
</P>
<P>
   Flores estimated the company would earn 64 cents per unit next
quarter, fed mainly by revenues from residential lot sales and a
pending $31.8 million sale of a luxury apartment site.
</P>
<P>
   Brett Hendrickson, an analyst at Los Angeles-based B. Riley and
Co., said the value of the company's assets are a more important
indicator of its health.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're not focusing on the bottom-line number,'' he said.
``We're looking at the value of their assets and the value they're
building for shareholders.''
</P>
<P>
   Sutro and Co. estimates the company's net asset value at $35.60
a unit.

REVENUE RISE FORECAST AT 20TH CENTURY INDUSTRIES
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
   WOODLAND HILLS, Calif. -- Auto insurance giant 20th Century
Industries Inc. is expected to report before the markets open today
that first quarter earnings rose nearly 4 percent compared with the
like year-ago period, in large part on the strength of new business
in three states it added to its market area.
</P>
<P>
   The Woodland Hills-based company is expected to report that the
company's net income for the period ended March 31 was $28.9
million, or 33 cents per share, compared with last year's $27.9
million, or 34 cents per share. The per-share results would be
lower because the company has 5.1 million more common shares
outstanding this quarter than it did last year.
</P>
<P>
   Revenues are expected to hit $219.5 million, up 2 percent from
last year's $215.1 million, despite some rate decreases.
</P>
<P>
   ``The business is growing and we have taken a rate decrease in
California of 6.8 percent and in Arizona of 9.7 percent for
competitive reasons,'' Ric Hill, the company's vice president of
corporate relations, said late Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Starting in mid-December, 20th Century began operating in
Nevada, Oregon and Washington. ``But the first quarter of 1999 is
when we actually did the business,'' Hill said.
</P>
<P>
   ``In terms of actual earnings, (we're) above last year,'' Hill
said.
</P>
<P>
   Shares of 20th Century rose 6.25 cents Wednesday to close at
$16.8125. New York-based American International Group, the largest
U.S. insurer by market value, owns a majority stake in 20th
Century.

 &HT;    Fortune looks at sex on company time
 &HT;    By Tom Walker
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ The National Inquirer has nothing on America's
mainstream business press these days, judging from the latest cover
stories.
</P>
<P>
   Fortune (May 10) says corporate America is ``addicted to sex,''
and this is creating costly problems from sexual harassment to
cybersex on company time to expense account abuse on the road.
</P>
<P>
   ``Most of my patients are CEOs or doctors or attorneys or
priests,'' the director of an Arizona clinic tells Fortune. ``We
have corporate America's leadership marching through here, and
they're paying cash because they don't want anybody to know.''
</P>
<P>
   While most industries are affected by work-related sex problems
to some degree, Fortune says a few stand out, especially Wall
Street. At the same time, recovery programs for people with a
problem are proliferating, says Fortune, whose May 10 edition goes
on newsstands Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Business Week (April 26) profiles another type of
``scandal on Wall Street'' in its latest cover story.
</P>
<P>
   Behind the scenes at the traditionally quiet and clean American
Stock Exchange, the magazine says a six-month investigation shows
this institution to be ``beset by price-fixing, conflicts of
interest and illegal trading _ made possible by a climate of lax
enforcement.''
</P>
<P>
   P.O.V. (May) offers advice to the hapless employee who is at the
mercy of a boss who is also ``a psychotic, disorganized,
manic-depressive, power-mad control freak.'' Defensive maneuvers
range from transfer to another department, to flattery, to tuning
him or her out. Remember, the magazine says, ``nobody ever said the
workplace was fair. Your goal should simply be making it more
fair.''
</P>
<P>
   Worth considering ...
</P>
<P>
   _ Many small investors have been introduced to stock market
investing through 401(k) plans, but Kiplinger's Personal Finance
Magazine (May) says you still have to work at it.
</P>
<P>
   ``You don't have to be a Wall Street wizard to make a 401(k)
plan work its magic, but you need a plan,'' says the magazine.
``You can't leave something this important to happenstance or
guesswork.''
</P>
<P>
   _ Bloomberg Personal Finance (May), meanwhile, has a solution
for investors torn between putting money in big stocks (market
values of $100 billion or more) or small stocks (less than $1
billion). Try midcaps, especially those that are listed in the S&AMP;P
Midcap 400 index.
</P>
<P>
   Not only do many of them outperform the larger stocks of the S&AMP;P
500, many get big enough to be added to the 500-stock list. When
that happens, institutions suddenly take an interest and become
buyers of those shares, bidding up the price.
</P>
<P>
   _ Technology stocks have taken something of a drubbing recently,
but they have a record of outperforming the market over a longer
period. That, says Individual Investor (May) is why ``tech funds
are sprouting all over, and there's one for every taste.

EARNINGS PROVE HAPPY SURPRISE FOR WALL STREET
</HEADLINE>
   (nk) 
 By JONATHAN FUERBRINGER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   First-quarter earnings reports are pouring in, and they are
pleasing. Citigroup beat Wall Street estimates by 16 percent. IBM
had a robust quarter. Boeing pleasantly surprised. International
Paper's earnings fell less than expected while its executives
pointed to rising paper prices and returning demand in Asia.
</P>
<P>
   Even Exxon, which experienced a sharp drop in earnings because
of plummeting oil prices in January and February, beat analyst
estimates by a penny. Similarly, Coca-Cola's revenues and profits
did not fall as much as had been feared, giving its stock a lift
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Positive earnings surprises are running higher than the
historical average, with about half the 500 companies in the
Standard &AMP; Poor's index of large companies reporting, according to
IBES International and the First Call Corp., which track earnings
projections and results.
</P>
<P>
   If the trend continues, earnings this quarter could grow 9
percent to 10 percent, according to First Call. That pace would
make the quarter the first with above-average earnings growth since
the end of 1997.
</P>
<P>
   But even more significant is the steady rise in earnings
forecasts for all of 1999 by Wall Street strategists.
</P>
<P>
   Without doubt, the overall economic outlook has improved both in
the United States and abroad. There are signs of a turnaround in
Asia, battered since the devaluation of the Thai baht in 1997.
European central bankers have cut interest rates to spark growth.
Investors are betting again on emerging markets, and Brazil seems
to be getting its problems under control just months after it
devalued its currency.
</P>
<P>
   What's more, higher earnings are looming for the oil industry
since oil prices have risen sharply in recent weeks. And better
results than expected last quarter for American industries, like
paper, and for cyclical companies that thrive when the economy is
strong are causing financial analysts to reassess.
</P>
<P>
   The brightening picture is encouraging investors to take a
longer view and providing signs of support for the stock market in
the months ahead. And the overall rise in expectations is
distracting from some of the big disappointments, like the earnings
shortfall at Compaq Computer and Intel's weak first-quarter sales.
</P>
<P>
   In just five months, Bruce Steinberg, chief economist at Merrill
Lynch &AMP; Co., has moved from forecasting a 5 percent decline in
operating earnings for the S.&AMP; P. 500 in 1999 to an increase of 8.5
percent. Douglas R. Cliggott, U.S. equity strategist at J.P.
Morgan, is now predicting an 8 percent jump. Stronger than expected
growth at home and abroad caused him to jettison his measly
forecast of 2 percent earnings growth last fall.
</P>
<P>
   And corporate profits for 2000 are looking good, a fact that
should buoy investors, who bet in large part on what a company is
expected to earn in the years ahead. In fact, Abby Joseph Cohen,
the co-chairwomen of the investment policy committee at Goldman
Sachs &AMP; Co., puts earnings growth next year at 8 percent, slightly
stronger than this year's upwardly revised 7 percent.
</P>
<P>
   All this rosy talk has obscured the stock market plunge of last
fall and the third quarter's decline in operating earnings, the
first quarterly decline since 1991.
</P>
<P>
   But as the selloff early this week in growth and technology
stocks indicates, the question remains whether these improved
earnings projections are enough to support the high cost of stocks.
IBES, which gauges the attractiveness of stocks based on corporate
earnings and interest rates, shows stocks at their highest
valuation since 1987.
</P>
<P>
   Even with higher earnings, ``the market will still be too
expensive,'' said Byron R. Wien, U.S. investment strategist at
Morgan Stanley Dean Witter. He estimates that the S.&AMP; P. 500 index
is overvalued by about 26 percent, a level that in the past has
signaled a stock market correction. Another cautionary note may be
seen in the declines in the shares of Exxon and Microsoft on
Wednesday even though both companies reported numbers that were
better than expected.
</P>
<P>
   Still, confidence begets confidence. An improved earnings
outlook may encourage investors to ignore warning signs, as they
have in the past. The Leuthold Group's major trend index for the
stock market has blinked red since June 1998, with a brief
exception from Nov. 9, 1998, to Feb. 8, 1999, when the stock market
was recovering from last fall's 19 percent drop in the Dow Jones
industrial average and the 30 percent plunge in the Nasdaq
composite index from its high.
</P>
<P>
   And if the recent investor moves out of technology and growth
stocks result in a broadening rally in the stock market, some
strategists will become more confident about the outlook, despite
record high valuations.
</P>
<P>
   Thomas McManus, the equity strategist at NationsBanc Montgomery
Securities, predicts that a good first quarter will just spur
analysts to increase their earnings expectations more for the rest
of the year.
</P>
<P>
   The actual rate of earnings growth is not that important, he
said. Instead, it's the ratio of positive surprises to negative
surprises that matters, he said, ``because a surprise in earnings
is what drives analysts to revise their expectations upward and
that, in turn, can help drive the stock higher.''
</P>
<P>
   According to First Call, the earnings estimates for the paper
and aluminum industries have already been revised upward.
International Paper is now expected to report 1999 earnings of
$1.03 a share, up 23 percent from the estimate before the company
released its first-quarter earnings.
</P>
<P>
   McManus and Cliggott of J.P. Morgan also tend to ignore the
overall earnings growth for the S.&AMP; P. 500. They consider it
misleading because the index is weighted in favor of big names,
like Microsoft, General Electric and Exxon. And the earnings
performance of these few companies can overshadow the general
trend.
</P>
<P>
   For example, overall S.&AMP; P. reported earnings rose 9.2 percent
in the fourth quarter of 1998 from a year earlier. But when
calculating the average by giving each company the same weighting,
earnings fell 2.5 percent, according to Bloomberg News, indicating
that many more companies had earnings declines. (Reported earnings
are the actual profits reported. Operating earnings, which most
market strategists and analysts use, strip out one-time changes and
other factors that may distort the longer-term trend in a company's
earnings.)
</P>
<P>
   So far this year, more companies are healthier financially,
according to Bloomberg. Reported earnings for the first quarter are
up 5.5 percent when weighting each company in the S.&AMP; P. equally
and 17.4 percent when favoring the returns from the big stocks.
</P>
<P>
   The one caveat, of course, is that the improving earnings
picture is based on an economy that keeps humming. If growth is so
strong that inflationary pressures build the Federal Reserve may
have to rein in the economy by raising short-term interest rates, a
move that almost always punishes stocks.
</P>
<P>
   Mitchell J. Held, the co-manager of U.S. economics at Salomon
Smith Barney, is not worried about the Fed raising rates this year.
But he says a rate hike could come next year. And if it does, he
said, ``that is when the market gets hit, and the higher the
valuation, the sharper the fall.''

EXPULSION OF KOSOVARS TO BE TOTAL, U.S. SAYS 
</HEADLINE>
  (sw) 
 By DAVID E. ROSENBAUM   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ New evidence indicates that Yugoslav President
Slobodan Milosevic intends to sweep all of Kosovo and not allow
ethnic Albanians to remain even in the province's most sparsely
populated areas, the State Department's top authority on atrocities
said on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   David J. Scheffer, the U.S. ambassador at large for war crimes
issues, said in an interview that he had received clear evidence
overnight that Serbian forces had savagely attacked remote villages
in eastern Kosovo and had expelled Albanians.
</P>
<P>
   Until now, some officials had speculated that after ethnic
Albanians had been routed from the central and western parts of
Kosovo, Milosevic might try to resolve the conflict by suggesting a
partition that would allow him to control most of Kosovo and allow
Albanians to remain in the eastern towns like Gnjilane.
</P>
<P>
   ``It appears to be demonstrated now that there is a final
solution to ethnic cleansing,'' Scheffer said.
</P>
<P>
   He added: ``It is a total ethnic cleansing campaign. Even those
areas that up to this point have not been hit the hardest are now
being hit. They are going through the backwater area.''
</P>
<P>
   The Clinton administration is eager to publicize accounts of
atrocities, since the brutality against Kosovo's Albanians is the
main rationale for NATO's bombing of Serbia.
</P>
<P>
   In the interview, Scheffer said the evidence he received on
Wednesday, based on aerial photographs and interviews with refugees
in Albania and Macedonia, included these examples of Serbian
violence against ethnic Albanians:
</P>
<P>
   _ Serbs have begun systematically executing young men in a way
that makes it appear they died in battle.
</P>
<P>
   _ The estimated number of Albanian Kosovars who have been killed
and buried in mass graves has reached at least 3,700. Last week, a
NATO spokesman put the figure at 3,200.
</P>
<P>
   _ The number of residential areas that have been burned or
otherwise destroyed by Serb forces since late last month now totals
at least 500, 100 more than the figure announced last week.
</P>
<P>
   Refugees who have recently fled from Kosovo report that in many
places, Serbs have rounded up young Albanian men, forced them to
run a few hundred yards and then shelled them or gunned them down,
Scheffer said.
</P>
<P>
   This method of execution, he said, ``creates forensic evidence
that would allow the Serbs to say they were collateral casualties
of military operations.''
</P>
<P>
   For weeks, there has been little coordination among those who
have questioned refugees about potential war crimes, including
officials from the United States and other NATO countries and
scores of private relief workers. And there has been no clearing
house for their findings.
</P>
<P>
   Now, Scheffer said, a uniform questionnaire is being used for
the interviews, and the United States and the Organization for
Security and Cooperation in Europe are developing a database for
the material. The information will be turned over to the
International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
   At least 20 or 25 U.S. government officials or people on
contract to the government are among those conducting the
interviews, Scheffer said.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, he said, analysts who review photographs taken from
satellites and spy planes have received additional training to spot
evidence of possible war crimes.

 &HT;    Analysts want details on Compaq problems
 &HT;    By Jerry Mahoney
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ Since Sunday's ouster of Chief Executive Eckhard
Pfeiffer, Compaq Computer Corp. Chairman Ben Rosen has stressed the
need for better execution if the troubled Houston-based giant is to
return to a position of leadership in the fast-changing computer
industry.
</P>
<P>
   Wednesday, when the company reported a first-quarter profit of
$281 million that was in line with Wall Street's diminished
expectations, Rosen added a surprising perspective on what he
called the ``unacceptable'' performance that apparently sealed
Pfeiffer's fate.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had set a more aggressive plan than was appropriate,''
Rosen said during a conference call with reporters. ``That was the
main reason for the shortfall.''
</P>
<P>
   Earlier this year, Compaq had projected first-quarter profits of
$534 million. Two weeks ago, it shocked Wall Street when it
announced profits wouldn't be nearly as much, sending its stock
diving and helping prompt Pfeiffer's departure.
</P>
<P>
   Revenue for the quarter ended March 31 was $9.4 billion, up
nearly 66 percent from a year ago. That jump reflects added
revenues from Digital Equipment Corp., which Compaq acquired last
summer for about $9 billion. The $281 million in profit translated
to 16 cents per share, compared with 1 cent last year. Before the
April 9 earnings surprise, Wall Street had expected 32 cents a
share.
</P>
<P>
   Rosen said Wednesday the overly optimistic forecast for the
quarter was hurt because of slowing growth in PC demand. Yet that
is a perennial first-quarter challenge for most PC makers because
buying slows dramatically after the holiday season. He also blamed
intense price cutting for corporate customers, which analysts
believe was started by IBM.
</P>
<P>
   That Compaq could have missed its earnings projections by so far
a margin _ and the lack of detail about the shortfall _ only added
to Wall Street's current uncertainty about the company.
</P>
<P>
   Wall Street brokerage companies manage billions of dollars in
clients' money. They rely on senior management for information
about plans to improve weaknesses and for guidance on a company's
performance in upcoming quarters.
</P>
<P>
   They'll have to wait for those details from Compaq.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's like throwing darts,'' said Art Russell of the Edward
Jones securities company in St. Louis.
</P>
<P>
   Rosen said Wednesday, as he did earlier in the week, that the
three-man team of directors who will guide Compaq until a new CEO
is named needs more time to identify exactly what needs fixing.
</P>
<P>
   ``Having been in office now for 48 hours, we're examining every
aspect of the company,'' he said. ``Our plans are to speed up
decision-making and make the company more efficient.''
</P>
<P>
   There was some good news in Wednesday's report.
</P>
<P>
   The company said it now supplies more than a third of the
servers that power World Wide Web sites, sales of its new
entry-level servers exceeded expectations and its sub-$1,000 PCs
are profitable.
</P>
<P>
   ``If there is any positive to be taken . . . it's the PC
business is alive and well,'' Russell said. ``Their consumer
business grew 30 percent.''
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, analysts agree that the company's core strategy of
selling a range of products, from cheap PCs to powerful computers
that cost hundreds of thousands of dollars, while augmenting the
business with global computer services, is sound.
</P>
<P>
   ``These guys are still No. 1,'' said Lou Mazzucchelli an analyst
with the Gerard Klauer Mattison securities company in New York.

FATHER OF VICTIM SAYS SON `HAD CONFLICT' WITH SUSPECTS 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By JAMES BARRON   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The father of one of the victims in the Colorado school
shootings said his son had ``had a conflict'' with the presumed
gunmen last year and that he believed his son was a target even
before he was shot to death in the library at Columbine High
School.
</P>
<P>
   The names of the 15 victims _ 14 students and one teacher _ had
not been released by Wednesday evening. But a father, Michael
Shoels of Littleton, Colo., said officials had notified him that
his son, Isaiah, was among those killed when two students carrying
semiautomatic weapons stormed the school on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   After the shootings, there were accounts that the gunmen had
sought out black students and athletes, but Isaiah Shoels, who is
black, may have been shot because of the old conflict, his father
said.
</P>
<P>
   Shoels said that Isaiah, an 18-year-old senior at Columbine whom
he described as a jock with a passion for weight lifting, had had a
dispute with the gunmen last year, but he did not elaborate on what
the dispute was about or why he believed it flared up again, this
time in such a violent way.
</P>
<P>
   But he said he believed, based on accounts from his son's
classmates, that the two students who have been named as the
gunmen, Eric Harris and Dylan Klebold, had been determined to track
down his son.
</P>
<P>
   ``The kids that got away explained it to us,'' Shoels said.
``They said he was one of the main targets because they hunted him
down. He wasn't in the main area. He was in the library. They came
through the cafeteria, they hunted him down.''
</P>
<P>
   Shoels said that his son wanted to be a record-company executive
like one of his role models, Master P, the rapper and recording
executive whose No Limit label pumps out hit albums and
direct-to-video movies. Master P had also been trying to play
professional basketball, scrimmaging with the Charlotte Hornets
until he was cut from the team in February.
</P>
<P>
   ``Master P, he took all of these artists and created an
empire,'' Shoels said. ``That was something Isaiah wanted to do in
his lifetime. He most definitely had the smarts to do it. He was
studying music contracts.''
</P>
<P>
   In addition to Isaiah Shoels, another victim was apparently
William David Sanders, a business teacher and coach. Relatives of
Sanders said Wednesday that they had been notified by the Jefferson
County coroner's office that he had been killed. Some students said
that Sanders had been shot twice in the chest as he was trying to
shepherd the students to safety during the attack.
</P>
<P>
   ``He dedicated his entire life to teaching,'' said Rich Jarmon,
Sanders' nephew, who said that Sanders coached the track team and
the women's basketball team at the school. ``Recently he had talked
of retirement, but he said how hard it would be to leave the
school.''
</P>
<P>
   On Tuesday, Jarmon said, Sanders was substituting for a science
teacher. ``Anytime anyone needed a favor,'' Jarmon said, ``he was
the first one there. If you needed a hand, he was always there.''
</P>
<P>
   Jarmon said that Sanders, who was 48 and had been a teacher in
schools in Jefferson County for 22 years, had four daughters. He
also had 10 grandchildren.
</P>
<P>
   Anne Marie Hocchalter, a 17-year-old senior who plays the flute
in the marching band and the wind symphony, remained in critical
condition at Swedish Hospital Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   ``She's a good kid,'' said David Maas, who lives down the block
and described neighborhood basketball games that pitted Ms.
Hocchalter against her brother.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're a very close-knit family and don't have any
problems,'' Maas said. ``It's a shame it had to happen to them.''
</P>
<P>
   Valerie Schnurr, 18, was hit by shrapnel and was in fair
condition Wednesday. A neighbor, Loretta Jay, said that Ms. Schnurr
had an after-school job in a bank and was excited about the school
prom. She said Ms. Schnurr was looking forward to attending the
University of Northern Colorado in Greeley in the fall, where she
wanted to study counseling so she could work with troubled people.
</P>
<P>
   A cousin of another wounded student, Jeanna Park, 15, said that
Ms. Park was a senior with a grade-point average of 4.0. The
cousin, who did not want to be identified, said Ms. Park was born
in Korea but grew up in Colorado. Her father, Andrew Park, is an
accountant, the cousin said. ``She told her parents what happened,
but the doctor wants her to rest and not speak much,'' the cousin
said. ``She can get up and move around but she's still weak.''
</P>
<P>
   Among the victims who were treated and released was Joyce
Jankowski, who taught English and journalism, said a former teacher
who was at Mrs. Jankowski's house in Littleton Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Jankowski's husband, Leo, said she was ``pretty shaken
up.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a scary situation,'' Jankowski said.

URBAN SCHOOLS OFFER SECURITY LESSONS FOR SUBURBAN COUNTERPARTS 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By JANETTE RODRIGUES 
c. 1999 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   HOUSTON _ To prevent school violence, suburban and rural school
districts should consider some measures used by their urban
counterparts, experts and educators say.
</P>
<P>
   None of the school shootings since 1997 have happened in urban
schools. Experts say that's probably because they stress such
prevention measures as metal detectors, increased security, school
uniforms, parental involvement, alternative schools and
conflict-resolution programs.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the case of suburban school districts, they haven't had to
think about this,'' said Joanne McDaniel, research director for the
Center for the Prevention of School Violence in Raleigh, N.C.
</P>
<P>
   And it doesn't help, she said, when school districts that
haven't had to deal with serious violence ignore the multifaceted
problems that lead to incidents such as the murders of 15 students
Tuesday attack in Littleton, Col.
</P>
<P>
   Many schools aren't taking day-to-day security measures, such as
requiring students to wear school uniforms.
</P>
<P>
   ``More than 70 percent of our schools require uniforms, which
make it hard to hide a weapon and prevent the wearing of
gang-related clothing,'' said Terry Abbott, Houston Independent
School District spokesman.
</P>
<P>
   Whether real or perceived, violence in the nation's schools has
been an issue of concern, research and debate for more than two
decades. When school shootings such as the ones that occurred in
Colorado, Mississippi, Kentucky, Arkansas and Oregon happen, some
districts look, listen and search for ways not to become the next
Littleton.
</P>
<P>
   In the Fort Bend Independent School District southwest of
Houston, administrators such as Mary Ann Simpson, the associate
superintendent for community relations, are watching the TV
coverage from Colorado.
</P>
<P>
   ``Short of turning our schools into prisons, there is no 100
percent guarantee that you can eliminate this kind of thing,'' she
said. ``But you can certainly look for ways to strengthen and
improve what you have in place ... and listen to our kids, talk to
our kids, especially those that seem isolated.''
</P>
<P>
   Fort Bend doesn't have metal detectors in its schools but does
have district police officers at middle and high school campuses,
video surveillance cameras in some schools and a student
crime-stopper number to report incidents to administrators.
</P>
<P>
   Tonya Aultman-Bettridge, a researcher with the Center for the
Study and Prevention of Violence in Boulder, Colo., isn't sure the
school shootings in Littleton could have been prevented with better
or more security measures. She believes school climate is more of a
deterrent than metal detectors.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think installing metal detectors and having armed
police officers roaming the halls is the solution,'' she said. ``We
concentrate a lot on teaching kids math and science, and we don't
integrate things like violence prevention into the curriculum.''
</P>
<P>
   She suggested that districts foster an environment where violent
behavior is unacceptable; teach students social skills such as
anger management and empathy; and create a crisis plan and build
partnerships between schools, law enforcement, social services,
parents and the community.
</P>
<P>
   ``Schools don't exist by themselves,'' Aultman-Bettridge said.
</P>
<P>
   McDaniel noted that the majority of the nation's schools
continue to be safe places free of violent incidents.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are still talking small numbers,'' she said. ``But we are
talking serious rage, and we need to get to know our young people
so that when they are feeling rage we can act to help, not just
react.''

DAY OF VIOLENCE THREATENS RESIDENTS' SENSE OF SAFETY AND FAITH IN
THE FUTURE 
</HEADLINE>
   (af)  
 By DON TERRY   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   LITTLETON, Colo. _ The good life is gobbling up the old life in
every direction around here. Where not too long ago there was
prairie and small-town America in the shadow of the foothills, now
there are new and expensive houses, lush golf courses, shopping
malls, multiplex movie theaters and modern walled communities with
bygone names like Country Farms and Grant Ranch.
</P>
<P>
   But Wednesday, 24 hours after two teen-age boys turned nearby
Columbine High School into a killing field, many people here are
mourning not just the sons and daughters who were cut down but also
the area's old-fashioned sense of safety and maybe even its
old-fashioned faith in the future.
</P>
<P>
   ``This used to be one of the quietest places in the state,''
said Kay Chambers, the box officer manager of the Town Hall Arts
Center. ``Now, it just feels like the world is out of control, that
it is a much more violent and dangerous place. When I look at
what's going on in Kosovo and Africa and now here, it breaks my
heart.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, people here say they leave their doors unlocked and most
said they had no plans to lock them _ yet. There are dozens of
homeowner associations, ball fields, tennis courts, a new nature
path and three or four forests worth of new houses going up.
</P>
<P>
   Downtown Denver is about 10 miles away and it seems as though
every one of those miles is filled with strip malls, fast-food
restaurants and commuters.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's been so much growth, we can't even get across the
street any more,'' said Marion Nygren, who has lived here for 40
years.
</P>
<P>
   And every summer, this middle- to upper-middle-class city of
40,000 residents holds its Western Welcome Week with hand-cart
races, a firemen's tug-of-war and square dancing in the streets.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a great place to grow up,'' said Jared Smith, 18, after
he left flowers outside the high school to remember the dead and
wounded. ``This is the last community you'd think something like
this would happen.''
</P>
<P>
   Littleton was founded in 1890, and its early residents were
mostly farmers and gold prospectors. The first industry in town was
the Rough and Ready grain mill on the South Platte River, where
baptisms were sometimes performed.
</P>
<P>
   After World War II, ranching and farming gave way to electronics
and the aerospace industry, still a factor today, and Littleton's
population began to skyrocket, making longtime residents like Marty
Garcia a little worried that perhaps Littleton was moving too fast.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's still nice, but it used to be a whole lot nicer,'' said
Garcia, the owner of a barber shop in the older downtown section of
Littleton. ``Today, people are moving so fast that they just don't
seem to take the time to pass the time of day with their neighbors.
Maybe if we did, maybe if we looked out more for each other, we
could prevent some of these tragedies.''
</P>
<P>
   Columbine High's mailing address is in Littleton, but the school
is actually in unincorporated Jefferson County. The school accepts
students from around the area, and almost everyone refers to its
location as Littleton. Wednesday here and in Denver almost everyone
was in mourning as school sessions were canceled, sporting events
rescheduled and flags lowered to half staff.
</P>
<P>
   ``We will get through this,'' said Rich Couris, who has lived in
Littleton for just a few years after his employer transferred him
here from Southern California. His daughter, Kristin, is on the
Columbine lacrosse team.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a real hodgepodge of incomes, talents, education,''
Couris said of Littleton. ``It's a great mix and we love it.''
</P>
<P>
   There is little racial diversity. The area is overwhelmingly
white and heavily Republican, said Bill Babcock, the director of
the Town Hall center, who grew up in Denver and has lived here
since last July. ``It's a very conservative area,'' Babcock said.
``I used to think that I was the only Democrat in town.''
</P>
<P>
   Tony Amaro, who is Hispanic, moved to the area from California
in 1992 after being transferred by the Union Pacific Railroad.
Although Amaro said there had been a few times when he felt hostile
stares from white residents, by and large, he said he and his
family had not encountered racism here. That is why he was a little
surprised at some reports _ still not confirmed _ that the teen-age
gunmen wanted to shoot the few black and Hispanic students who
attend Columbine High.
</P>
<P>
   ``This whole thing is mind boggling,'' Amaro said. ``I can't
believe that somebody didn't see this coming, that somebody didn't
see that these kids were so troubled.''
</P>
<P>
   Amaro came back to the school Wednesday with his daughter,
Crystal, 17, who attends Columbine and saw a friend get shot.
</P>
<P>
   ``She was helping a girl who was shot,'' he said. ``When she got
home, she found blood on her boots, her pants. We just tossed
everything in the garbage. We're going to take her to counseling in
a few minutes. She just wanted to come by for another look. None of
us can believe this happened.''
</P>
<P>
   The police were still collecting evidence at Columbine
Wednesday. But once the school reopens, Andrea Grimm, 17, a senior,
said she would be one of the first in line to go back to class.
Miss Grimm was also there when the killing spree began and watched
in horror as one victim staggered and then fell bleeding on the
floor.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm going back to graduate,'' she said. ``That's my main
goal.''

 &HT;    House panel OKs bill to put candidates' finance data on Net
 &HT;    By Scott S. Greenberger
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ Texans would be able to use the Internet to take
a look at the campaign contributions of legislative and statewide
candidates under a bill a House committee approved Wednesday. A
similar bill awaits floor action in the Senate.
</P>
<P>
   Under current rules, candidates can file their campaign finance
records in written form, and they aren't available on the Internet.
Interested Texans have to trek to the Texas Ethics Commission in
Austin and sift through piles of paper to get the information.
</P>
<P>
   Supporters of the bill, filed by Austin Democrat Sherri
Greenberg, argue that making the records more accessible will
better equip voters to make educated choices. It also will make
candidates more accountable for the money they collect, they say.
</P>
<P>
   ``The voter has a right to know where a candidate's getting his
or her money from. If I receive a donation and I accept that
donation, then I have no right to complain about people knowing
about it,'' said Rep. Tom Uher (D-Bay City).
</P>
<P>
   ``People can see it and they can determine whether that is a
contribution from some entity that they can support or not
support,'' Uher added.
</P>
<P>
   Similar legislation failed last session, partly because of
concerns that requiring electronic filing by computer disc or modem
would place a heavy burden on less well-funded candidates who
aren't computer-literate. But ever-expanding access to computers
and the Internet, coupled with some exceptions in Greenberg's bill,
assuaged those concerns. The bill exempts candidates who aren't
using a computer in their campaigns or who collect or spend less
than $20,000 in a year.

GOTH GENRES, FRINGE ROCK AND GERMANY 
</HEADLINE>
   (Eds: Please use this version, which includes some textual changes
and inserted material)  
 (af)  
 By TODD S. PURDUM   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Like generations of teen-age misfits and outcasts
before them, the post-pubescent gunmen in the Colorado school
shootings apparently found comfort in the words of the darker bards
of their age _ in this case in the depressive, anarchic, nihilistic
and suicidal musings of the disparate strands of fringe rock music
genres known as Goth and industrial.
</P>
<P>
   It is not clear that either of the presumed gunmen firmly
identified himself as a Goth or industrial adherent, or that their
musical tastes had anything to do with the shootings. But
schoolmates said that at least one of the two wore a baseball cap
with the logo of the popular industrial band KMFDM, and he
apparently posted its apocalyptic lyrics on a personal Web page.
</P>
<P>
   Goth, shorthand for Gothic, grew out of the ashes of punk-rock
in Britain in the late 1970s, and later took root in Los Angeles
under the rubric of ``death rock.''
</P>
<P>
   Industrial music flowered in Northern Europe and North America
beginning in the 1980s on the theory that the everyday mechanical
sounds of the modern age could be captured, recorded and
manipulated into music that questioned authority and orthodoxy.
</P>
<P>
   The two genres have since spread from urban underground clubs to
suburban fans. The styles sometimes overlap and not even their
adherents can agree on precisely how to categorize artists and
bands.
</P>
<P>
   But the essence of Goth is ``very depressing, kill-yourself
music,'' said Ali Ohta, the director of publicity for Cleopatra
Records, the nation's largest Goth label, based in Los Angeles.
</P>
<P>
   Eric Harris, one of the two suspected gunmen, maintained a Web
page and user profile on America Online in which he quoted lyrics
of KMFDM, which was founded in Germany and whose name is shorthand
for ``Kein Mehrheit fur die Mitleid,'' which which the band's Web
site translates as ``No no pity for the majority.''
</P>
<P>
   KMFDM, founded by Sascha Konietzko in Paris in 1984 in a
performance that featured the sound of Polish coalminers banging
their tools, has been based in the Pacific Northwest and Canada in
recent years. It broke up in January and released its last album,
``Adios,'' on Tuesday, the day of the shootings, according to its
official Web site.
</P>
<P>
   One of the band's past songs, ``Piggybank,'' included the lyric,
``If I had a shotgun, I'd blow myself to hell.''
</P>
<P>
   The two suspected gunmen were reported to have harbored a hatred
for minorities and a fascination with Hitler. But Nicole Blackman,
a former spokeswoman for KMFDM, said emphatically that the band did
not subscribe to racist or neo-Nazi views.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Blackman said the band's message was ``rip the system,'' but
added: ``I can't understand how a couple of kids in Colorado in
black trench coats could think that KMFDM's message is to go out
and shoot people.''

 &HT;    `It could happen anywhere,' principal says
 &HT;    By Michael Browning
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   LAKE WORTH, Fla. _ Principal David Cantley's heart sank when he
heard the news of the nation's latest _ and most staggering _
school massacre.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I heard about it, my feeling was, `There, but for the
grace of God, go I,' '' the 61-year-old veteran administrator at
Lake Worth High School said.
</P>
<P>
   ``What happened in Colorado could happen anywhere, anytime. I
always have it at the back of my mind. You prepare for the worst
and pray for the best,'' Cantley said.
</P>
<P>
   Ripples of amazement swept through the 77-year-old school
Wednesday as students, teachers and administrators all attempted to
take in the sheer enormity of the Colorado bloodbath.
</P>
<P>
   Students are asking themselves and each other what might have
triggered the tragedy.
</P>
<P>
   They are looking at their own classmates with new eyes.
</P>
<P>
   They are wondering if a shooting spree like the one that took
place Tuesday could happen here _ and some have reluctantly
concluded that it could.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I heard about it, I felt, man, that stuff's horrible,''
said Bobby Gilbert, a senior at the school. ``But it can happen at
any high school.''
</P>
<P>
   ``You can't trust nobody,'' agreed Jimmy Aguirre, a junior.
``They ought to arrest everybody in that gang. They ought to be
asking the parents questions. And yes, it could happen here. It
could happen anywhere.''
</P>
<P>
   Aguirre spoke during the early lunch period at the high school,
in a cafeteria ringing with loud, excited voices and laughter. When
someone exploded a paper lunch bag, a newspaper reporter flinched,
but the students themselves seemed to take it in stride. There are
more than 2,600 students in the school _ so many that the first
lunch period starts at 10:25 a.m.
</P>
<P>
   Lake Worth High first opened its doors in 1922. It is situated
atop a sandy white rise of ground near Interstate 95, and its
Mediterranean-style, cream-colored buildings, with their shady
porches and sunny walkways, have a cozy, academic, sheltering feel
to them.
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, two police officers are on duty every school day
here, and a third, equipped with a walkie-talkie, watches the
nearby I-95 overpass for suspicious traffic approaching the campus.
Two teachers rove the grounds continually, on the lookout for
strangers.
</P>
<P>
   The school is not equipped with metal detectors, and the
students themselves see no need for them.
</P>
<P>
   ``Kids can break into anything,'' said Jenny Wagner, a freshman.
</P>
<P>
   There was a shooting here three years ago, when two nonstudents
came onto school property and picked a fight. One of the intruders
was shot in the stomach. The bullet exited his back and wounded a
female student standing behind him, Cantley said.
</P>
<P>
   While there are loners and misfits at Lake Worth High, they
don't terrify the students _ at least not Elatia Mann, a freshman.
``They just keep to themselves, singly,'' she said. ``There'll be
one way over here, and another one way over there. But they aren't
in a gang or anything, like these kids in Colorado with their
trench coats.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think what happened there could happen here,'' said
John Dandrie, a senior. ``We've got so many races, so many
minorities at this school, we're all used to each other. We can all
talk to each other.''
</P>
<P>
   Sentiments like these are welcome to the ears of Cantley, a
plain-spoken West Virginian with 30 years' experience in education,
19 of them spent at Lake Worth High.
</P>
<P>
   ``We didn't have an announcement this morning, or a moment of
silence, or anything like that,'' Cantley said. ``I didn't want to
get in there and rile feelings up even more. We let the teachers
discuss it with the students if the students wanted to. We're
preparing a big sympathy card for the students in Colorado, and
we're going to mail it out to them, after we've gotten as many
signatures as possible.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know how we could protect these students any more than
we're doing, except to surround the school with razor wire. But can
you just imagine how those parents in Colorado feel, being called
up and asked to come down and bring their child's dental records?''
Cantley trailed off, shaking his head.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have a theory about this. When this thing settles out, I
will tell you what you will find. You will find some kids who never
were part of their school. They didn't get on any team. They didn't
belong to a drama club or the band. They never learned to win and
lose and be part of a larger effort.
</P>
<P>
   ``They never experienced the glory of being a winner at
anything. Activities give a kid something to look forward to. They
fill a void in the heart. These children, it sounds like they never
had their moment in the sun, so they decided to have their moment,
in their own way.''

COCA-COLA ANNOUNCES 13 PERCENT FIRST-QUARTER DROP IN NET INCOME 
</HEADLINE>
  (jt) 
 By CONSTANCE L. HAYS    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Continuing a recent pattern of weak results, the Coca-Cola Co.
said Wednesday that its first-quarter net income fell 13 percent as
the company struggled to expand its business.
</P>
<P>
   The amount of Coke concentrate sold worldwide declined 1
percent, as did revenues, the company said. But expenses rose 5
percent, to $1.953 billion from $1.857 billion in the first quarter
of 1998, diminishing earnings, which were $747 million, or 30 cents
a share, down from $857 million, or 34 cents, in the comparable
quarter a year earlier.
</P>
<P>
   Nearly every one of Coca-Cola's regional markets reported flat
or declining volume. The exception was North America, where case
volume rose just 1.5 percent, well off the 6 percent increase for
the first quarter of 1998. The company said higher prices,
instituted in many markets at the start of the year, were
responsible for the drop in sales.
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, Wall Street bid up the shares $2.3125, to
$67.5625, largely because there were some signs that the company's
troubles were bottoming out.
</P>
<P>
   Much of the bad news had been shared with analysts last month.
But several analysts still expressed surprise at the extent of
Coke's difficulties in certain regions.
</P>
<P>
   ``These are very discouraging trends in the North American
market,'' said Skip Carpenter, a beverage analyst for Donaldson,
Lufkin &AMP; Jenrette, adding that he was perplexed by the weak demand
for Coke products. Sales of concentrate to restaurants, sports
arenas, movie theaters and other public places, rose just 1 percent
in the quarter.
</P>
<P>
   And Michael Branca of Lehman Brothers said he was concerned
about the future. Coca-Cola spent heavily for the volume it
achieved, he said, and such spending will only increase as the
company tries to drive volume overseas.
</P>
<P>
   ``Coke is certainly going to have the volume, but at what
cost?'' Branca said. Bottlers are starting to want to raise prices
around the world to try to increase their returns _ something
Branca said Coke wants to prevent. ``Rather than international
bottler retail hikes, which would slow concentrate volume growth,
we expect Coca-Cola to fund much of that differential,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The company spent $1.2 billion on marketing support and
infrastructure payments for its largest bottler, Coca-Cola
Enterprises, in 1998. Branca said the company, in similar fashion,
will have to ``dramatically increase its spending levels
overseas.''
</P>
<P>
   Coca-Cola's chairman and chief executive, M. Douglas Ivester,
announced the results to an audience of generally friendly and
supportive investors at the company's annual meeting in Wilmington,
Del., Wednesday morning. He described ``a rare but real
gravitational pull against our sales and volume'' because of
recessions around the world, and vowed that the company would
bounce back quickly.
</P>
<P>
   ``We expect business conditions to start improving as we move
into the second half of the year,'' Ivester said.
</P>
<P>
   The company reported that case volume fell 4 percent in Latin
America in the quarter, compared with a 19 percent increase in the
first quarter of 1998. Volume in Brazil was down 10 percent, and in
Venezuela and Colombia, the combined volume plummeted by 24
percent. Ivester said the company ``intends to keep investing in
Latin America to enhance our business system during the current
economic crisis.''
</P>
<P>
   Price cuts are planned in Thailand, Germany and South Africa,
the company said Wednesday, but Branca predicted those would
further erode Coca-Cola's profits.
</P>
<P>
   Volume in the Middle East and Far East was flat, and in Europe,
it declined 2 percent. Volume in Africa, one of Coca-Cola's
smallest regional markets, declined 1 percent.
</P>
<P>
   The biggest growth came from the company's Minute Maid unit, a
small fraction of overall sales, where volume rose 5 percent.
</P>
<P>
   And there were glimmers of improvement in some areas. Carpenter
of Donaldson, Lufkin said, for example, that sales during the
Easter holidays were stronger in Germany and some parts of Western
Europe.
</P>
<P>
   Andrew Conway, a beverage analyst for Morgan Stanley, also
expressed optimism: ``We're approaching the bottom. You still need
a flashlight, but the tunnel has a little more light.''

EUROPEANS THREATEN BAN ON U.S. BEEF IMPORTS 
</HEADLINE>
  (js) 
 By EDMUND L. ANDREWS   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   FRANKFURT, Germany _ The European Union's executive agency
threatened Wednesday to ban beef imports from the United States, a
move that intensifies a long-running feud over beef from
hormone-treated cattle.
</P>
<P>
   European agriculture authorities in Brussels said they had found
traces of growth hormones in imported American beef, which violates
a European prohibition. The officials said they could start
blocking all beef imports as early as June 15 if the United States
did not address the issue.
</P>
<P>
   The complaint comes in the middle of a much bigger trade brawl
over Europe's basic prohibition on beef laced with growth hormones.
</P>
<P>
   The United States has fought the ban for years, arguing that
there is no scientific evidence of health risks from such beef.
Most American beef producers feed growth hormones to cattle to make
them grow faster and bigger.
</P>
<P>
   The Geneva-based World Trade Organization, which has legal
authority over such trade disputes, agreed with the United States
in 1997 and declared the ban illegal because the European Union had
not made a convincing scientific case about health risks.
</P>
<P>
   But the European Union kept its rules in place, arguing that it
had the right to carry out new scientific studies. The World Trade
Organization is scheduled to take up the issue again on May 13,
deciding whether the Europeans are violating its earlier rulings.
</P>
<P>
   On Wednesday, though, European officials added a new twist. In a
recent check of current American beef imports, which are supposed
to be hormone-free, officials in Brussels said about 12 percent of
the samples contained enough hormone residue to indicate that they
came from cattle raised with hormones.
</P>
<P>
   Gerry Kiely, an agricultural spokesman, said a ban on American
beef would be proposed to take effect on June 15. In the meantime,
he said, European officials would try to reach an agreement with
their American counterparts on ways to make sure that exports are
in fact hormone-free.
</P>
<P>
   In the United States, the beef industry said the European Union
announcement Wednesday was simply a negotiating tactic. ``It's just
very interesting timing,'' said Julie Bousman, a spokeswoman for
the National Cattlemen's Beef Association. ``The bottom line is
that beef produced with growth hormones is safe. There's no reason
for them to stop any imports.''
</P>
<P>
   The amount of trade involved is relatively small, about 7,000
tons a year worth about $20 million, because most American beef is
already blocked by the hormone rules. Europeans buy about 400,000
tons of hormone-free beef a year, Kiely said, most of it from
Eastern Europe and South America.
</P>
<P>
   The dispute over hormones reflects an increasingly contentious
trade relationship between the United States and the European
Union.
</P>
<P>
   The Americans recently won a protracted battle they took to the
World Trade Organization over banana-import restrictions, but the
two sides are squabbling over when American penalties were to take
effect.
</P>
<P>
   They are also arguing over a European complaint about jet-engine
noise, and the Europeans are planning to restrict planes fitted
with noise mufflers, contending that the devices are inadequate.
The biggest impact of the restriction would be on American aircraft
manufacturers and suppliers.

 &HT;    Web a sounding board for sadness, anger
 &HT;    By Jeff Houck
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. _ Colorado high school gunman Eric Harris
may not have felt accepted in the halls of Columbine High, but he
was apparently right at home navigating the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   Harris had at least two identities on America Online. Under the
names rebldomakr and DAMMISSED1 he penned an AOL ``member profile''
quoting violent passages from the shoot-out-style computer game,
Doom.
</P>
<P>
   In a space for a personal quote, Harris chose ``Quit whining,
it's just a flesh wound _ Kill Em ALLLL!!!!'' He listed his hobbies
as playing Doom and ``being cool.'' And he said he worked part-time
at a fireworks stand.
</P>
<P>
   His profile was still available late Tuesday, but by 10 a.m.
Wednesday it and another thought to belong to the other gunman,
Dylan Klebold, had been removed. America Online has offered to
share computer records with the FBI that might be relevant to the
shootings.
</P>
<P>
   Also circulating on the Internet, a Web page supposedly
constructed by Harris. Before authorities could remove it, the page
had been copied and posted at another Web site.
</P>
<P>
   The page reportedly features lyrics by obscure German rock band
KMFDM (Kein Mehrheit Fur Die Mitleid, which, roughly translated,
means ``No Pity for the Majority.''): ``I have come to rock your
world/ I have come to shake your faith/Anathematic Anti-Christ/I
have come to take my place.''
</P>
<P>
   There's no tellng if the page was authentic (an AOL spokeswoman
said hoaxes are common after big news events), but it made the
rounds on the Internet, passed like a grisly electronic trophy.
</P>
<P>
   For the most part, though, the Web on Wednesday was a place
where people gathered to try to make sense of the massacre.
</P>
<P>
   Exactly 24 hours after the killings, the tone in the AOL chat
room named ``Crisis in Littleton'' was confused, angry and
vengeful.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wish I was a parent of a student at Columbine High,'' wrote
one person signed on as Blue19blue. ``I would shoot the gunmen for
being such jerks if they weren't already dead.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Blue, you're the kinda person who caused them to do that,''
replied AustinMojo.
</P>
<P>
   ``THE DIFFERENCE WITH ME IS THAT I RECOGNIZE IT,'' Blue19blue
snapped, using capital letters as the ultimate in on-line chest
thumping.
</P>
<P>
   A couple clicks away were a dozen more chat rooms, with names
such as ``COLORADO KILLINGS'' and ``School shootings.'' It all
added up to a beehive of verbal jousts. One moment a wounded soul
would request a moment of virtual silence in the room. The next, a
mischievous teen-ager would hurl electronic insults and sexual
slurs aimed at shattering the reverence.
</P>
<P>
   ``All of these reactions are totally normal,'' said Paula
Statman, president of the KidWise Institute in Oakland and author
of ``Raising Careful, Confident Kids in a Crazy World,'' an advice
book aimed at parents of Net-savvy teens. The Internet, she said,
is becoming an emotional refuge for those who can't seem to deal
with such horrific events.
</P>
<P>
   At www.parentsplace.com _ a site usually aimed at new mothers
and the frustrated parents of teens _ women discussed the fear and
dread of the mothers in Littleton, who waited Tuesday afternoon to
hear word of their children.
</P>
<P>
   Jackie Needleman, vice president of parentsplace.com, said the
site tried be a sounding board without appearing to capitalize on
the deaths. By late Wednesday, the site had about two dozen
postings from frazzled moms.
</P>
<P>
   ``I blame others as well as myself because we all have a hand in
raising each other's children whether we know it or not,'' wrote a
woman identified only as glendakaye.
</P>
<P>
   ``When we send our children out there, how are they treating
others? Are they being unkind and creating monsters or are they
extending a hand in fellowship?''

BRADLEY TO GET SUPPORT OF SEATTLE MAYOR, OTHERS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By JOEL CONNELLY  
 c.1999 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEATTLE _ The presidential campaign of former Sen. Bill Bradley
will gain the endorsement of Seattle Mayor Paul Schell on Thursday
morning, and a contingent of about 15 state legislators will show
their backing at a dinner Thursday night.
</P>
<P>
   After months of low-key visits, Bradley will bring his
presidential campaign to a state that has traditionally smiled on
reformist, insurgent Democrats.
</P>
<P>
   ``I guess there is a certain genuineness about Bradley that I
instantly related to. Maybe it's not smart politics, but my job is
to support the person who would make the best president,'' said
Schell, America's first big city mayor to endorse Bradley.
</P>
<P>
   State Rep. Ed Murray, D-Seattle, another Bradley backer, added:
``He brings a level of thinking about where we need to be as a
party, a society and as a nation that we must have in the
Democratic Party.''
</P>
<P>
   Supporters of Vice President Al Gore, the Democrats'
front-runner, on Wednesday professed not to be worried.
</P>
<P>
   ``Bradley has little or no support in the Congress,'' said Rep.
Norm Dicks, D-Wash., who is co-chairing efforts to line up House
Democrats behind Gore.
</P>
<P>
   Gov. Gary Locke and King County Executive Ron Sims have declared
their support for Gore. Sen. Patty Murray, D-Wash., has worked
closely with Gore and is expected to back him in advance of a vice
presidential dinner in June.
</P>
<P>
   But Bradley could be highly competitive in a state that has just
moved up its presidential primary to Feb. 29. He left the Senate in
1997 after 18 years representing New Jersey, and has since written
a book and taught at Stanford and Notre Dame.
</P>
<P>
   Bradley was in Seattle last January on the day that he announced
he was running for president, quietly making his case to a luncheon
of prominent Democrats at the Seattle Hilton Hotel.
</P>
<P>
   The one-time New York Knicks forward has argued that it is time
for Democrats to move on from the Clinton-Gore administration.
``The case for a new beginning is self-explanatory,'' he told the
January lunch.
</P>
<P>
   Gently lampooning the president, Bradley added: ``One of the
things I would do is not talk as much. Now you have the president
driving every evening news cycle.... I wouldn't depreciate the
value of my words by talking all the time.''
</P>
<P>
   The themes have found resonance among some Democrats.
</P>
<P>
   ``He has indicated a willingness to go outside the traditional
interests of the Democratic Party to build the coalition we need in
the future,'' said state Rep. Jeff Gombosky, D-Spokane, a Bradley
supporter.
</P>
<P>
   The list of sponsors of Bradley's dinner on Thursday night
includes six Seattle-area business leaders who also have given
money to Republican Sen. Slade Gorton.
</P>
<P>
   Gore has tirelessly courted Washington, beginning in his 1988
presidential campaign but particularly over the past two years. He
has been in the Seattle area seven times since January of 1997.
</P>
<P>
   Schell has been on hand to greet Gore on most of his visits. But
the mayor argued on Wednesday that Bradley would be the better
Democrat to tackle urban issues.
</P>
<P>
   ``He brings intelligence, compassion and he understands issues
of racism,'' Schell said.
</P>
<P>
   Dicks argued, however, that Gore has done heavy lifting on
Northwest issues and will show his hands-on involvement with local
issues.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's going to run a very vigorous campaign here, talking about
his record helping with environmental issues like the Northwest
forest plan and his work on recovery of salmon,'' Dicks said.

<P>
   LITTLETON, Colo. _ As parents waited in agony nearby and police
squads searched for explosive booby traps inside, authorities
carefully made their way through Columbine High School on Wednesday
where they found the bodies at least 15 people killed by gunshots
or homemade pipe bombs in a massacre Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Among the dead were the two members of the senior class who are
believed to have unleashed the carnage before turning their guns on
themselves. They were found shot in the head.
</P>
<P>
   Twelve of the dead, including both suspects, were found in the
school's library, said the Jefferson County sheriff, John Stone,
who added that there were so many weapons and explosive devices _
including 30 bombs, a semi-automatic rifle and pistol and two
shotguns _ that investigators were still unsure how they got it all
inside the school. They may have hidden it during several trips or
they may have had help, Stone said.
</P>
<P>
   David J. Thomas, the district attorney, at a press conference at
the school Wednesday afternoon, said there are two or three active
separate investigations of a Web site connected to the suspects in
the case.
</P>
<P>
   ``There has been a Website for some time,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Thomas said that investigators are looking at eight to 10 people
who might have knowledge of the case.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think there is evidence to suggest that other people were at
least aware of what was going on. There were a lot of devices. They
took a long time to construct and a lot of people were familiar
with the web site.
</P>
<P>
   Stone said a computer had been seized at a suspect's house, and
they were tracing the e-mails.
</P>
<P>
   But an even more unfathomable set of questions surrounded the
motivations of the two suspects, 18-year-old Eric David Harris and
Dylan Bennett Klebold, 17, who were described by many students
Wednesday as members of a self-styled group of loners and outcasts
who called themselves the ``Trenchcoat Mafia'' after the long black
coats they wore and shared a fascination with violent video games
and a antipathy toward the more popular students who they referred
to as ``jocks.''
</P>
<P>
   Both Harris and Klebold were arrested last year for breaking
into a car, and parents of another student at the school said that
they had complained to authorities last year about death threats
made by Harris against their son. Nonetheless, school authorities
and many students insisted Wednesday that they never seriously
considered either young man to be inclined toward the horrific
violence let loose here Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   The incident set off a national bout of soul-searching and
debates over whether the killings were spurred by easy access to
guns or by the violent images on television and in video games to
which America's children are routinely exposed.
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton said in Washington that ``all of us are
struggling to understand exactly what happened and why.''
</P>
<P>
   The shootings also had immediate political reverberations as
well: In at least three states, including Colorado, sponsors of
legislation expanding the rights to carry guns withdrew those
measures Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   The authorities were still so concerned about the possibility of
more danger that all of the bodies were not removed from the school
until Wednesday evening.Some were so unrecognizable that parents
were asked to bring dental records of their missing children to the
school.
</P>
<P>
   The death toll, which represents the largest school massacre in
the country's history, was a downward revision from the possible 25
deaths that the authorities had said on Tuesday. But it was unclear
whether it would rise again as the search inside the school
continued.
</P>
<P>
   Eleven of the dead are male, including at least one teacher and
one black student whom the killers had shot in the head.
</P>
<P>
   Sixteen people are still hospitalized, 11 of them in serious or
critical condition, according to a spokesman for the sheriff's
office.
</P>
<P>
   All day long, under sunny skies that turned slate grey with an
approaching storm Wednesday afternoon, students gathered near the
high school for any news about friends still officially listed as
missing. Many were crying or clutching flowers that they brought to
a makeshift memorial.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can't even imagine walking into that school right now,''
said 17-year-old Dara Ferguson, a junior, who had three friends
whom she feared were dead. ``I don't think I ever want to set foot
in there again.''
</P>
<P>
   Officials with the Jefferson County School District said that
the building, with hundreds of bullet holes and several inches of
water that came from sprinklers that went off after the bombs did,
would remain closed for the rest of the school year.
</P>
<P>
   In Alabama and Florida, the school shooting prompted lawmakers
to postpone consideration of bills that would prohibit cities and
counties from suing gun makers for the cost of gun violence. The
bills, similar to others passed around the country, were introduced
at the behest of the National Rifle Association to protect the
firearms industry from liability suits.
</P>
<P>
   But at least some politicians said that the violence might have
been averted if someone else had been armed at the school.
</P>
<P>
   ``Had there been someone who was armed, in this particular
situation, in my opinion, it may have stabilized,'' said Minnesota
Governor Jesse Ventura, who supports loosening restrictions on
concealed handguns. ``I believe it supports conceal and carry
because of the fact that what happens when a group of unarmed
individuals are confronted with people with weapons like this, you
have no defense.''
</P>
<P>
   And Charlton Heston, president of the National Rifle
Association, said the incident showed that there should be armed
guards in the nation's schools.
</P>
<P>
   ``If there had been even one armed guard in the school, he could
have saved a lot of lives and perhaps ended the whole thing
instantly,'' he said in Los Angeles on Wednesday. There was, in
fact, an armed guard at the school and he exchanged fire with one
of the suspects.
</P>
<P>
   Here in Littleton, a Denver suburb where spiffy new housing
developments and shopping malls are rising out of former farmland
that backs up to the foothills of the Rocky Mountains and where
many parents say they moved to enroll their students in good and
safe public schools, grief and shock were pervasive Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   The names of the dead began to filter out Wednesday evening,
though the authorities said they were not prepared to release an
official list. The families of Rachel Scott, 15, and Isaiah Shoels,
18, said that their children had died in the shooting and a
teacher, William David Sanders, was widely identified as the
faculty member who had perished.
</P>
<P>
   Shoels, who was black, was apparently singled out for killing,
according to some of the students who survived the library rampage.
</P>
<P>
   ``They seemed to seek him out,'' Joshua Lapp, a senior at the
school who dove for cover with other students in the library.
``They went past a row of desks and one of them said, `Look,
there's that little nigger.' Then there were three shots and one of
them said, `Is he dead?' and the other one said, `Yes, he's dead
all right.' ''

   Crystal Woodman, a junior who was also in the library at the
time, told ABC's ``Good Morning America'' program that the two were
laughing as they went about their killing binge.
</P>
<P>
   ``They were just, like, they thought it was funny,'' said Miss
Woodman. ``They were just, like, `We've waited to do this our whole
lives.' And every time they'd shoot someone, they'd holler, like it
was, like, exciting.''
</P>
<P>
   In the killers' arsenal, found Wednesdayat several places in the
school, were 30 bombs, including several constructed from propane
gas cylinders, a 9 mm semiautomatic rifle, two pistol-grip
shotguns, one handgun and at least 100 rounds of ammunition, said
Stone.

KAREEM RUSH JUST ONE OF BRUINS' QUESTION MARKS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JON WILNER  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Recruit Kareem Rush could select a college as
early as Friday _ or he could wait until mid-May. He has narrowed
his choices to UCLA, where he'd join his big brother JaRon, and
Missouri, where he'd be two hours from his Kansas City home.
Although Rush's grandmother, Jeanette Jacobs, has insisted he'll
sign with UCLA, the Bruins aren't sure.
</P>
<P>
   Why should they be? Around Pauley Pavilion, nothing is certain.
</P>
<P>
   The basketball program that in recent years has given us
Blazergate, Schea Cotton's ephemeral appearance, Jim Harrick's
dismissal, Jelani McCoy's departure, Baron Davis' knee and a spate
of surprising victories and predictable postseason defeats ... is
once again in flux.
</P>
<P>
   The chaos began soon after UCLA's first-round loss to Detroit,
with a testy team meeting. Coach Steve Lavin, who became very
emotional during the meeting, later described the players as
``salty'' and attributed their mood to the first-round exit.
</P>
<P>
   But it wasn't about Detroit. It was about the sporadic offense,
the lack of teaching in practice, the revolving lineup and an
inconsistent substitution pattern _ all things Lavin must correct
to make the Bruins a consistent top-10 team. Even the players know
it. Will the coaches correct the problems next season?
</P>
<P>
   Lavin's new six-year rollover contract, which keeps him at UCLA
until 2012, should help. Relieved of the daily pressure to keep his
job, Lavin can sacrifice temporal goals for long-term success. He
can use early-season games to develop the bench, for instance,
without fretting that defeat will cost the Bruins a 20th win and
prompt a coaching search. Whether they win 18 or 28, he's here for
the duration.
</P>
<P>
   The contract drew skepticism from Lavin's peers and several
prominent UCLA boosters, who questioned what he had done to deserve
the coveted rollover clause. ``It makes you wonder what kind of
deal he'd get if they actually ran an offense,'' one UCLA booster
said, shaking his head.
</P>
<P>
   Although the contract came days after the team meeting, it had
been in the works for weeks _ at the request not of athletic
director Pete Dalis, sources said, but vice chancellor Peter
Blackman, who oversees the athletic department and likes Lavin.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, the Bruins are committed to a comparable deal for
football coach Bob Toledo. When Lavin got his mega-contract after
the Elite Eight run in 1997, UCLA gave Toledo a salary bump despite
his 5-6 record.
</P>
<P>
   Lavin isn't going anywhere, but that's not necessarily true of
several players. Here's a look at the pressing issues, some of
which might not be resolved until summer.
</P>
<P>
   Baron Davis: Don't read too much into his postseason silence.
According to several non-UCLA sources close to Davis, he has not
reconsidered his decision to leave school. In the next three weeks,
Davis will announce his intentions to turn pro.
</P>
<P>
   Kareem Rush: The first thing to know is he's not that good. He's
not as good as Ray Young and he's certainly not as good as JaRon.
He's a solid jump shooter and decent athlete who plays UCLA's
deepest position, wing guard. But he's blood, and the Bruins
believe signing Kareem will keep JaRon around an extra year or two.
</P>
<P>
   Something else to consider: If Kareem signs with Missouri, the
Bruins move one step closer to landing Fresno wing guard DeShawn
Stevenson, the state's top junior. He has UCLA on his short list
and playing time on his mind.
</P>
<P>
   JaRon Rush: Regardless of Kareem's decision, it's difficult to
imagine JaRon bolting for Missouri. That would not only require
sitting out a year, it would delay his NBA dream. The energetic
Rush can't sit still for five minutes, much less five months. Rush
likes UCLA and loves playing with childhood friend Earl Watson, but
the Bruins are worried members of Rush's inner circle _ especially
his Kansas City girlfriend and her mother _ will pressure him to
move closer to home.
</P>
<P>
   Travis Reed: A sophomore forward who averaged 16 minutes and was
often lost in the rotation, Reed is mulling a transfer. He sees Dan
Gadzuric, Jerome Moiso and Matt Barnes _ all freshmen _ and wonders
where the minutes are. In addition, the Bruins pursued (and missed)
two top recruits, Carlos Boozer and Justin Davis, who play Reed's
position. That didn't do much for his confidence.
</P>
<P>
   Assistants Mike Holton and Jim Saia: Despite being Harrick's
hire, Saia is justifiably concerned that his peers view him as
Lavin's high school buddy, not a solid young coach. Saia and Holton
tried and failed to land the head coaching jobs at San Diego State,
Washington State, Nevada-Reno and Pepperdine, and there aren't many
vacancies left.

 &HT;    Reds sale will have `no impact' on another Ohio team
 &HT;    By Marc Katz
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   DAYTON, Ohio _ The sale of the Cincinnati Reds to a group of the
team's limited partners Tuesday should result in ``no impact
whatsoever'' on Dayton's Class A baseball team that will operate in
the Midwest League next season, according to John Allen, Reds'
managing executive.
</P>
<P>
   The local team, owned by Mandalay Sports Entertainment, will be
stocked by the Reds, who have been working diligently on
strengthening their scouting department and development of players
over the past three years.
</P>
<P>
   Robert Murphy, president of the Dayton team, also said the
ownership change would not affect his team.
</P>
<P>
   ``In order for baseball to come to Dayton, we needed to be
affiliated with the Cincinnati Reds,'' Murphy said. ``They supply
us with the team. We're keeping our focus on the city of Dayton.''
</P>
<P>
   With the gradual restocking of the Cincinnati scouting staff,
the Reds think they can supply plenty of players for the Dayton
team.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've made some really great strides in the last three
years,'' Allen said. ``I don't know if there's going to be a
significant increase in that area, and I'm not saying we're going
to short cut it, but we're getting very close to where we need to
be as far as the number of minor league teams we need to have and
what we're doing in the international market in the Dominican and
Mexico and that market.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're just going to keep up with what we started.''
</P>
<P>
   Allen said the Reds have added 15-20 new scouts over the last
three years.
</P>
<P>
   ``What that has done is give us the ability to do more cross
checking, especially as we get ready for the amateur draft in
June,'' Allen said. ``We want our top scouts to see our draft picks
as many times as we can.''
</P>
<P>
   In 1985, the first year Schott took over as president and chief
operating officer of the Reds, the team had a general manager, four
people in charge of scouting and player development, 18 scouting
supervisors, 19 scouts and four consulting scouts.
</P>
<P>
   Currently, the Reds have 14 people involved in scouting and
player development, three cross checkers, 19 scouting supervisors
and 19 scouts.
</P>
<P>
   Allen said three years ago, when he joined the team, there were
only ``about 15 full-time scouts'' on the payroll. Now, Allen
believes his team has a nearly full compliment of scouts who can
evaluate talent for the farm system.
</P>
<P>
   ``In our market, you can't afford to buy a $10-15 million power
hitter or a pitcher Kevin Brown,'' Allen said. ``You try to re-sign
a few of them, but you can't re-sign them all. You've always got to
make sure you have players in the pipeline so you can replace (free
agents). That's what this is allowing us to do.''
</P>
<P>
   Allen said the Reds have yet to establish an organizational
structure, but, ``You look at the quality of our partners, they are
all very successful business people. Knowing those limited partners
like I do, I think it's nothing but positive.''

SPORTS COLUMN: KNICKS' PROBLEMS RUN DEEPER 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By HARVEY ARATON   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ On the day Ernie Grunfeld's head would roll, like
another loose ball eluding a sore-kneed Knick, he awoke to the
latest explosion set off by his own failed chemistry test.
</P>
<P>
   It was a somewhat predictable source manning the back page of a
New York tabloid, the combustible talent for whom he had gone out
on a teetering limb. Latrell Sprewell more or less thanked Grunfeld
and Dave Checketts for forgiving the P.J. Carlesimo incident by
treating Jeff Van Gundy's sixth-man deployment of him as
provocation for verbal assault.
</P>
<P>
   This time, via his hired mouthpiece, Sprewell figuratively
choked the coach.
</P>
<P>
   What we have here is a gasping team in a dying season. As a
fresh addition to a rotting core, Sprewell has not been working
out, in the Grunfeld-inspired tradition of Larry Johnson, Chris
Childs, Allan Houston and Charlie Ward. Checketts, the Madison
Square Garden president, had to do something, if only for the sake
of showing his superiors he was doing something.
</P>
<P>
   He ``reassigned'' Grunfeld and sent his friend and now former
team president on an all-expenses-paid scouting trip to Europe. He
fined Sprewell $25,000 for his agent's outburst. With playoff
tickets out in the mail, he demonstrated a Clintonian touch on
going the way of the prevailing wind.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you spend what we've spent on talent, to be a .500 team
is unacceptable,'' Checketts said. ``Period.''
</P>
<P>
   Actually, the more desired punctuation is a hyphen, Checketts
still not wanting to grade these Knicks on their declining test
scores. He hopes the scant remainder of this run-on season may yet
bear post-season fruit and a few rich-in-proceeds playoff dates.
While that might secure his own vocational standing with the
television moguls who own the Knicks and already interred Rangers,
nothing short of the conference finals is likely to spare the
coach.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are no winners today,'' said Checketts, quashing the
notion that Van Gundy had trumped Grunfeld in their silly
intramural feud. ``This is not a show of confidence in anyone.''
</P>
<P>
   Firing Van Gundy eight games from the end of the regular season,
much less sooner, would have been too great a concession to the
likes of Sprewell. And as Van Gundy will be remembered mostly as
the coach hired to make Patrick Ewing happy, his dismissal would
have been the impetus for the limping center to call it a season,
eliminating all post-season hope.
</P>
<P>
   If Checketts has studied his Garden history, he will allow the
next hierarchical appointee _ if he isn't an all-purpose savior in
the Pat Riley mold _ to select his own coach. That way, at least
until the team fails to meet future expectations that are directly
related to the exorbitant price of a ticket, the front office will
not set the same sad example as have Van Gundy and Grunfeld.
</P>
<P>
   Sprewell's agent, Robert Gist, was right about one thing, when
he said that the ``anxiety and hostility'' had made a deteriorating
situation that much worse. In the middle of the Knicks' late-season
swoon, priorities were skewed, the locker room reportedly a bazaar
for the crusading and the crude.
</P>
<P>
   ``The organization,'' Checketts said, ``was not on the same
page.''
</P>
<P>
   This is nothing new, dating all the way back to the Red
Holzman-Eddie Donovan years, and right on through the ill-fated and
in some cases shotgun marriages of Dave DeBusschere and Hubie
Brown, Al Bianchi and Rick Pitino, Riley and anyone who didn't bow
upon request.
</P>
<P>
   Did Checketts err in choosing the less threatening Grunfeld over
Riley in their 1995 struggle for control? Riley may have been
going, one way or another, but there is no way to defend Grunfeld's
subsequent record, especially the Charles Oakley-for-Marcus Camby
trade, which made perfect sense except in the context of the
previous moves. Foremost among them was the dubious 1996 decision
to plow on with Patrick in the pursuit of one title, a high-level
judgment that falls at Checketts' feet.
</P>
<P>
   For everything else, Grunfeld deserved to go, at least to
Europe. As for Checketts, he will ultimately be judged in the court
of corporate opinion, based on financial reports none of us have
access to. To blame him for miscalculations on the upsides of
Childs and Ward, among others, is almost as absurd as the
condemnations of him for booking a heavyweight title fight that
turned into a farce.
</P>
<P>
   Grunfeld rose in this organization from player to broadcaster to
assistant coach to general manager to the big boy job itself. He
survived in the Knicks' front office for a decade, and his time had
obviously come. He is a good man. We wish him a good flight.

EDITORIAL: THE COLORADO SCHOOL SLAYINGS 
</HEADLINE>
  (js) 
 
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The New York Times said in an editorial for Thursday, April 22:
</P>
<P>
   On the screen, the images are too familiar _ emergency personnel
bent double in concentration, anguished parents, weeping, puzzled
and wounded students, the ordinary buildings of a school that is no
longer ordinary. With the first reports of a shooting like the one
that occurred in Littleton, Colo., on Tuesday morning, a mental
accounting begins, an effort to tally the reasons, or the absence
of reason, that lie behind such a pitiless event. Reporters ask
questions about motive, scarcely differing from students and
parents in this respect, and those questions contain the unstated
hope that a predominant motive will emerge, a cause that somehow
encapsulates the tragedy and allows it to be set apart from
everyday life.
</P>
<P>
   One young mother, whose son stood unharmed beside her, talked on
television Wednesday morning about having moved to Littleton in the
hope that she and her family would find safety there. What her
words imply is the common faith that a kind of town exists where
violence is unheard of, a place so nice, so ordinary, that children
are inherently safe. But the American faith in exceptionalism _
that it can't happen here, not in this kind of town, not in this
country _ is a misplaced faith.
</P>
<P>
   Once, it was urban schools that seemed uniquely dangerous, for
reasons that appeared untransportable to middle-class Rocky
Mountain suburbs like Littleton. But whatever was local in the
motives of Eric Harris and Dylan Klebold is offset by an array of
contributory causes that are not local, that are universal in
modern America. One of the boys maintained a personal Web site,
since removed by America Online, espousing an addled philosophy of
violence and containing pipe-bomb-building instructions. Both boys
appear to have been fond of violent computer games and the music of
Marilyn Manson. And both found guns all too easy to come by. The
cultural fragments out of which Harris and Klebold invented
themselves, and their deaths, are now ubiquitous in every
community, urban, suburban and rural. What matters is not the
fragments but how they were combined.
</P>
<P>
   Most of us remember all too vividly the way high school felt. It
is a rare teen-ager who has never experienced a sense of alienation
or dislocation at school. But the cultural map of high school has
changed. The domain of fantasy has been enormously enlarged because
the tools to gratify a life of fantasy _ the Internet and computer
games, in particular _ have been spectacularly enhanced. Whether or
not hate-sites and visually violent games actually induce violence,
they do offer a place to hide that often makes it harder to tell
just where an imperiled student, like Harris or Klebold, actually
keeps his head. It is always hard for people with a clear grasp of
reality to see the ways that reality bends in minds as evidently
muddled and self-isolating as theirs were.
</P>
<P>
   It will be tempting to explain this tragedy through one of a
number of lenses, to argue that the problem here is guns or
Hollywood or the Internet or music. It will be tempting to think
that the proscription or control of one or another of these
elements will make the difference in preventing another tragedy
like the one at Littleton. When it comes to guns, a strong and
morally persuasive argument for control can be made. But it is not
what you keep from a child that will save him, nor what town you
move him to. It is what you put into him in the first place.

 &HT;    NCR stock drops despite strong earnings
 &HT;    By Angela Townsend
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   DAYTON, Ohio _ NCR Corp. on Wednesday suffered it biggest
one-day stock price drop since going public two years ago even
though the company reported stronger-than-expected first-quarter
earnings.
</P>
<P>
   NCR stock (NYSE: NCR) dropped 8 11/16, or 16.3 percent, to 44 in
heavy trading Wednesday. Analysts said the drop reflected concern
over lighter-than-expected sales of NCR's flagship data warehousing
products.
</P>
<P>
   Net income for the quarter, ended March 31, was $3.3 million, or
3 cents per share, compared with breakeven for the same period in
1998.
</P>
<P>
   Operating income improved $26 million from a loss of $34 million
a year ago. Sales for the quarter climbed 1.8 percent to $1.3
billion.
</P>
<P>
   The results exceeded consensus analyst expectations. First Call
Corp. had estimated per-share earnings of one penny for the
quarter.
</P>
<P>
   During a conference call with analysts, NCR Chief Financial
Officer David Bearman said the company still holds to its objective
of doubling its operating income this year.
</P>
<P>
   But Bearman's and NCR Chairman and Chief Executive Lars Nyberg's
answers to analysts' questions about NCR's data warehousing
business, which experienced what the company described as
``near-term weaknesses,'' failed to mitigate analysts' concerns.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hardware sales were half of what was expected,'' said Steven
Milunovich, an analyst with Merrill Lynch Global Securities. While
data warehousing is roughly only 15 percent of NCR's business, it
is a very visible portion that Milunovich called an ``important
swing factor'' in how NCR's stock performs. The closing price
``adequately reflects the risks and concerns,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   NCR Investor Relations Director Sajid Malhotra said, ``We have
to reinforce the message and internally deliver on what the
expectations are. This is about two things: setting the right
expectations, and second, meeting or beating those expectations. I
think we have to do work on both ends of that. But we feel we have
all the elements in place.''
</P>
<P>
   Despite Wednesday big drop, NCR's stock is still ahead about 4
points since the start of the year, Malhotra said.

 &HT;    Reynolds earnings rise
 &HT;    By Laura A. Bischoff
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   DAYTON, Ohio _ Strong earnings from the automotive division and
improved performance in the business forms division helped Reynolds
and Reynolds Co. boost fiscal second-quarter earnings 15 percent
from the same period last year, company officials said.
</P>
<P>
   The Dayton-based document management company said it earned
$30.4 million in the quarter ended March 31, or 38 cents per share,
compared with $26.4 million, or 32 cents per share, for the same
period last year.
</P>
<P>
   Second-quarter sales increased 5 percent to $392 million.
</P>
<P>
   Business forms revenues were $186 million, slightly ahead of
last year's $184.1 million but significantly better than the last
three quarters, company officials said. Meanwhile, automotive
division revenues climbed 9 percent to $196.4 million for the
quarter.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our record results were driven by continued strength in our
automotive division and substantial improvement in both revenues
and margins in our business systems division,'' said David R.
Holmes, chairman, president and chief executive.
</P>
<P>
   Equity analyst Gregory Gieber with Brown Brothers Harriman said
the results exceeded Wall Street's expectations. ``Finally in the
business forms area they have their act together. . . that area is
improving nicely and the other part of their business is doing
well,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Reynolds spent about $14.5 million repurchasing 791,300 shares
during the second quarter.
</P>
<P>
   Reynolds (NYSE: REY) stock closed Wednesday at 20 11/16, up 1
13/16.

<P>
   BRUSSELS, Belgium _ Britain and France are pressing the United
States to seriously consider sending ground forces into Kosovo. But
as leaders of the NATO nations begin gathering here on the eve of
the alliance's 50th anniversary summit, their differences are so
pronounced that the matter has been left off the agenda.
</P>
<P>
   The Clinton administration seems to be extremely wary about
suggestions that ground troops might have to go into Kosovo. One
senior official said he worried about a situation in which NATO
troops found themselves mired in a guerrilla war with Serb
renegades.
</P>
<P>
   ``The problem is not fighting your way in; it is what happens
after you get there,'' the official said.
</P>
<P>
   Nonetheless, Washington signalled some flexibility on Wednesday
night, saying it favored a broad NATO review of options developed
last summer on the use of ground troops in Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   The behind-the-scenes debate broke out into the open this week
in a coordinated series of statements by Britain's prime minister,
defense minister and foreign minister.
</P>
<P>
   With four weeks of bombing attacks already behind them, they
argued that weeks, if not months, of sustained bombing might
sufficiently weaken the Serb military so that NATO ground forces
could move into Kosovo and establish order with limited casualties.
The scenario has been discussed so much in the corridors of NATO
headquarters here that it even has a name: ``a semi-permissive
environment.''
</P>
<P>
   The British proposal would be a major shift from the NATO's
current plan, which is to send in a peacekeeping force of 28,000
troops, but only if President Slobodan Milosevic withdraws his
forces from Kosovo and accepts a peace settlement that allows the
hundreds of thousands of exiled ethnic Albanians to return to their
shattered homes.
</P>
<P>
   As Robin Cook, Britain's foreign minister put it Tuesday in an
address to Parliament, it is possible to ``conceive of
circumstances in which it may be feasible to commit ground
troops.''
</P>
<P>
   The main condition would be the assurance that NATO's force were
not facing ``organized armed resistance.'' As British officials
tell it, Milosevic would not be given a ``veto'' over the
introduction of allied ground troops.
</P>
<P>
   The British are not alone in pressing for the possible
introduction of ground forces. President Jacques Chirac of France
said in a televised speech Wednesday night that the alliance should
apply ``additional means'' besides escalating the air war to stop
``massacres, rapes, burned villages, families separated and thrown
onto the roads.''
</P>
<P>
   French officials said Chirac's statement was an allusion to
ground forces, and that France's plan was to seek a U.N. Security
Council resolution mandating such a force, though such a request
would almost certainly face a Russian veto. President Boris Yeltsin
has objected strenuously to any thought of the West sending in
ground troops.
</P>
<P>
   In Washington, the entire question of ground forces going into
potential combat in Kosovo has been highly sensitive. American
officials have sought to avoid public discussion of the matter.
Defense Secretary William Cohen suggested on Wednesday that the
matter of ground troops did not need to be decided because Gen.
Wesley K. Clark, the NATO commander, had not officially requested
authority to plan a military operation using combat forces.
</P>
<P>
   Left unstated was the fact that NATO's military commander was
not about to propose a major escalation in the fighting unless the
United States, the leader of the alliance, was behind it and was
ready to use its political influence to build support for a
decision to send in ground troops.
</P>
<P>
   But after saying for weeks that no such planning was necessary,
the White House said on Wednesday that it was time to study the
size and composition of the forces that would be needed.
</P>
<P>
   ``The U.S. would certainly support as a prudent measure any
updating of the assessments of the use of ground troops in a
permissive and non-permissive environment,'' the White House
official said on Wednesday evening. ``It would be irresponsible for
us not to periodically update our plans.''
</P>
<P>
   The allies were not the only ones the Clinton administration
appeared to have in mind. Sen. John McCain, R-Ariz., who is seeking
the Republican presidential nomination, has lambasted the Clinton
administration for starting an air campaign against Yugoslavia
without a backup plan for combat troops.
</P>
<P>
   Certainly, all the allies agree the bombing needs to go on for a
long time. Clark has repeatedly argued that the bombing campaign
has to have time to do its work and that it is too early to say if
it will succeed.
</P>
<P>
   On Wednesday night, the 29th day of bombing, allied planes hit
the headquarters of Milosevic's party in Belgrade, a
glass-and-steel 23-story building that also housed three local
television and radio stations.
</P>
<P>
   Defense Minister George Robertson of Britain described the
building as ``one of the nerve centers of the machine which plans
the killing in Kosovo.''
</P>
<P>
   Nonetheless, Western diplomats say Clark has told allied leaders
that he cannot guarantee that bombing attacks alone will compel
Milosevic to withdraw Serbian troops from Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Despite this, NATO nations have yet to ask him to draw up a new
plan to send in combat troops, nor has he asked for the authority
to begin planning.
</P>
<P>
   The review of military options, which the Clinton administration
says it now supports, stops considerably short of that.
</P>
<P>
   Even if there was a plan, lengthy preparations would be needed
to assemble the force. Even then, no ground attack could be carried
out without the approval of the entire 19-member alliance.
</P>
<P>
   In the absence of an agreement, diplomats here initially sought
to paper over their differences. But lately, the British have
insisted that ground troops might be needed to bring the war to an
end.
</P>
<P>
   Toward that end, Prime Minister Tony Blair met with Clinton here
Wednesday night in an apparent effort to persuade him to do more to
actively prepare in case land forces were needed.
</P>
<P>
   Blair made the case for this after meeting at NATO headquarters
with l Clark on Tuesday. He drew a distinction between sending in
ground troops against tough Serb resistance and sending them in
after punishing NATO bombing had taken the fight out of them.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have always made clear the difficulties of putting in
ground forces as a land force invasion against undegraded organized
Serb resistance,'' Blair said. ``We have also equally made it clear
that the international military force is there to allow people to
go back to their homes.''
</P>
<P>
   Going in on the ground would mark a huge departure for NATO,
which has been as preoccupied with maintaining public support at
home for the military campaign as in taking the war to Serb forces.
</P>
<P>
   Chancellor Gerhard Schroder of Germany would probably be in
favor of sending ground troops to Kosovo, but one European official
speculated that Foreign Minister Joschka Fischer's Greens Party
might break apart over the issue, collapsing the government.
</P>
<P>
   Canada would not oppose an alliance consensus, Prime Minister
Jean Chretien said in Montreal on Tuesday. ``If everyone is in
agreement, I will not be the only one disagreeing,'' Chretien said.
</P>
<P>
   The French position is less bold than it seems. French officials
say that France would be prepared to send in troops but only with a
mandate for such a force from the U.N. Security Council, which
would require persuading Russia not to use its veto power there.
</P>
<P>
   That would be a tall order since Moscow is adamantly opposed to
any force that does not have Milosevic's approval.
</P>
<P>
   NATO members will have ample opportunity to debate the issue at
the summit. Their foreign ministers and defense ministers will also
have separate meetings of their own on Friday.
</P>
<P>
   ``The issue of ground troops is not on the agenda in Washington,
but the leaders are certainly going to be talking about it, in
bilateral meetings, over dinner, informally,'' a high European
official of the alliance said.
</P>
<P>
   ``The British, the French and the Turks might all be willing to
go in with ground troops,'' he added. ``Others are more reticent.
But what do the Americans want?''
</P>
<P>
   The Clinton administration has been reluctant to take the lead
in thinking about a land operation.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is an American-led organization,'' the senior European
official said. ``If the Americans said we can't let Milosevic get
away with this, we've got to go in with ground troops, then each
country would have to consider the issue and make a decision. And
we could agree that only the countries that wanted to would
contribute.''

 NATO'S ATTACK ON MEDIA SENDS MESSAGE TO MILOSEVIC 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (SUBS to change height of building in 2nd graf from 24 stories to(mk) 
 By STEVEN ERLANGER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   BELGRADE, Yugoslavia _ When NATO struck hard at Yugoslavia's
political and media elite early Wednesday morning, it sent a clear
message that after weeks of hesitation, the alliance would now hit
the business interests of President Slobodan Milosevic's family and
friends.
</P>
<P>
   The three cruise missiles that set a 23-story building aflame
knocked three television stations off the air and destroyed the
offices of the political parties of Milosevic and his wife.
</P>
<P>
   It was NATO's first attack on the Yugoslav mass media in
Belgrade. The main state network, Radio and Television of Serbia,
was not hit and remained on the air.
</P>
<P>
   The building, formerly the Central Committee of the Yugoslav
Communist Party, contains the offices of Milosevic's Serbian
Socialist Party; the offices of the Yugoslav United Left party of
his wife, Mirjana Markovic; the studios and transmitters of radio
and TV Kosava, or Wind, which belongs to their daughter, Marija;
the studios and transmitters of TV Pink, which belongs to a family
friend, Zeljko Mitrovic, a prominent member of Yugoslav Left; the
studio and transmitter of the main sports channel, SOS, and the
main transmitter of BK TV, which owned by four brothers named
Karic, one of whom, Bogoljub, is a Yugoslav Left minister without
portfolio in the Serbian government.
</P>
<P>
   All the stations were knocked off the air, except for the
entertainment channel, Pink, which can be seen in one area of
Belgrade because Mitrovic also has a small transmitter on the roof
of his house in the elite residential and diplomatic area of
Dedinje. Late Wednesday evening, BK was back on the air in
Belgrade, although with a weak and blurry picture.
</P>
<P>
   An attack on the northern city of Novi Sad hit transmitters that
left the city of 400,000 without any television reception at all,
including the channels of state television.
</P>
<P>
   The last of Novi Sad's three bridges over the Danube was also
badly damaged, closing it to road and rail traffic. While the
Zezeljev bridge still stands, it is safe only for pedestrians now,
officials said. On Wednesday afternoon, NATO bombed a railway
bridge nine miles west of Belgrade.
</P>
<P>
   At a news conference in Belgrade on Wednesday, Robert Nemecek, a
program director for Pink, bemoaned the loss, in the conflagration,
of 123 episodes of ``The Simpsons'' and new episodes of ``Chicago
Hope'' and ``Friends.'' ``It is all burned,'' he said sadly.
</P>
<P>
   NATO officials said Wednesday that the building was a military
target, because it was part of a link in the city's coordinated air
defense system of radars and communication. But few here took the
NATO disclaimer at face value.
</P>
<P>
   The Serbian prime minister, Mirko Marjanovic, condemned the
attack as having no military purpose. ``This is yet more evidence
that the criminals target civilians,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   A senior Serbian journalist said: ``I'm now a lost cause for
their propaganda messages. All I can think of is that they just
killed some poor people who were on the night shift.''
</P>
<P>
   While there were no official reports of casualties, local
journalists said that at least 15 people had been working in the
building at about 3:15 a.m. when the first missile hit.
</P>
<P>
   In an interview with BBC World Television, the Yugoslav deputy
prime minister, Vuk Draskovic, a relative liberal, said again
Wednesday that the official news media were ``hiding'' casualty
figures and ``I don't know why.'' He said, also vaguely, that ``a
few thousand people, almost all of them civilians, are killed or
injured'' in NATO's attacks.
</P>
<P>
   But the spokesman for the Yugoslav Foreign Ministry, Nebojsa
Vujovic, has said on the record that more than 300 civilians have
been killed and up to 3,000 wounded since the NATO attacks began.
</P>
<P>
   Serbs here also say that NATO is dropping Serbian-language
propaganda leaflets in larger numbers. Oddly, a leaflet dropped
last week, which advertised radio and television frequencies on
which NATO information might be heard, included the frequencies for
Radio Kosava (102.2), which was not off the air until Wednesday
morning, and for B-92 (92.5), which has been taken over by the
government but remains on the air.
</P>
<P>
   Other frequencies listed, under the NATO logo and the headline
``We want to speak with you,'' include 106.4 and 1003 medium wave,
as well as television channel 21. NATO has been flying radio and TV
transmitter planes over Yugoslavia, but few Yugoslavs have seen or
heard the relatively weak transmissions.
</P>
<P>
   Another leaflet attempts to describe events in Kosovo, saying:
``For the last week Serb armies and police, under direct orders of
Slobodan Milosevic, have emptied the villages and towns of Kosovo''
and ``burned or destroyed thousands of houses.''
</P>
<P>
   The leaflet asserts that ``heads of families were torn away from
their wives and kids and killed'' in what it calls, in boldface,
``Milosevic's pogrom.'' It continues, ``There is a fear that
thousands of innocent people have been killed.''
</P>
<P>
   It concludes, in boldface, ``Do not allow misguided patriotism
to connect you to his misdeeds,'' and then ends with a sort of
advertising slogan: ``NATO defends the defenseless.''
</P>
<P>
   The leaflet fails to mention the fundamental NATO demand, which
Milosevic has firmly rejected, that Kosovo be occupied by an
international security force with a core of armed NATO troops. Most
Serbs interviewed strongly oppose an armed foreign force in Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   The effectiveness of such propaganda leaflets, which remind many
educated Serbs of the leafletting efforts of the Nazis in World War
II, is impossible to know. Many Serbs in larger cities have access
to Western satellite television in any event.
</P>
<P>
   Many of those interviewed over the last month who have such
access, or access to the Internet, nonetheless regard Western
assertions of Nazi-like atrocities as exaggerated and hyperbolic.
The more damage NATO does to ordinary Serbs on behalf of the ethnic
Albanians, one senior Serbian journalist said, ``the less people
worry very much about them.''
</P>
<P>
   Another Serbian journalist said, ``There's a feeling that we're
all collateral damage now.''

 &HT;    Sunbeam loses $898 million in '98
 &HT;    By David Sedore
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOCA RATON, Fla. _ Sunbeam Corp. said Wednesday it lost $897.9
million _ a rate equaling nearly $2.5 million a day or more than
$102,000 an hour _ on sales of $1.8 billion for 1998.
</P>
<P>
   More than a third of the total loss, nearly $311 million,
occurred during the fourth quarter when the company generated about
$515 million in sales.
</P>
<P>
   By comparison, Sunbeam earned $38 million on revenue of about
$1.1 billion in 1997, and during the fourth quarter that year, it
earned $9.5 million on revenue of $262 million.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the magnitude of the losses, Chairman and Chief
Executive Officer Jerry Levin was optimistic about Sunbeam's
future.
</P>
<P>
   He said many of the company's bottom line problems were one-time
expenses or related to excess inventory built up during the
two-year tenure of former CEO Albert J. Dunlap who was fired last
June. Dunlap, who is out of town, could not be reached for comment.
</P>
<P>
   Levin also warned that the progress Sunbeam has made over the
past nine months might not be reflected financially until 2000.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're proud of what we've done,'' Levin told analysts during a
conference call Tuesday. ``Without doubt Sunbeam is a better
company than it was the last time we spoke (in December). There are
many encouraging signs. Unfortunately, 1999 can't show Sunbeam's
full potential.''
</P>
<P>
   Levin cited $30 million in positive cash flow during the
quarter, plus the elimination of the company's excess grill
inventory as evidence Sunbeam is heading in the right direction.
</P>
<P>
   However, analyst Tom Burnett of Merger Watch said the company
still has more than its share of problems.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'd say the company still has a lot issues ahead, the bank
lender issue, the SEC review and the late filings with the SEC,''
Burnett said. ``They're not out of the woods by any means.''
</P>
<P>
   Sunbeam previously announced it would be late filing its annual
report with the Securities and Exchange Commission largely because
it had to restate earnings for 1996 and 1997. The SEC also is
continuing to investigate Sunbeam's accounting, and the company
just received a one-year extension of the deadline to comply with
the terms of its $1.7 billion bank loan package.
</P>
<P>
   Levin also said that while the company has no immediate plans to
sell off any of its businesses, it might do so in the future.
Sunbeam makes a wide array of consumer products, such as toasters,
electric blankets and scales. It has about 350 employees at its
Boca Raton headquarters.
</P>
<P>
   The earnings report had little impact on Sunbeam's stock (NYSE:
SOC), which closed at $5.50, down 6 cents a share. It had traded as
high as $31 last April.
</P>
<P>
   Sunbeam's losses included an operating loss of $796 million.
</P>
<P>
   Chief Financial Officer Bobby Jenkins said much of the losses
included one-time or unusual expenses, such as a $62 million
write-down in the value of First Alert, one of the companies
Sunbeam bought last year.

HATE TRACKERS SAY THEY FOUND TRENCHCOAT MAFIA ONLINE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
BY DAVID R. BAKER  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES -- Researchers with the Simon Wiesenthal Center said
Wednesday that they stumbled upon a ``Trenchcoat Mafia'' Web site
weeks ago as they were tracking hate groups on the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   Believed to belong to the Columbine High School group, the site
contained disturbing poetry and was linked to anarchist Internet
pages, but the researchers saw nothing suggesting a violent
assault.
</P>
<P>
   ``There was no indication that this was a dangerous site from
people planning something,'' said Rabbi Marvin Hier, dean and
founder of the Los Angeles center. ``If there had been, we would
have taken action immediately.''
</P>
<P>
   Hier and others at the center said the site's links suggest that
members of the group may have learned bomb-making techniques from a
digital subculture of hate.
</P>
<P>
   They called on Internet companies to voluntarily screen out
sites that promote hatred or teach weapons construction.
</P>
<P>
   ``You've reached the big leagues,'' Rabbi Abraham Cooper said.
``Don't tell me you're just the cable guy.''
</P>
<P>
   Students Wednesday said that such Web pages are easy to find.
</P>
<P>
   ``They tell you what you need to buy, what temperature to cook
it at,'' said Devin Hasselquist, 14, a middle school student from
Diamond Bar.
</P>
<P>
   He and other students visiting the center said the blame for
such easy access lies with the people behind the individual sites,
not the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   ``Whoever wants to put it on there, it's their fault,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Wiesenthal center officials said they tried to access what they
believe is suspected gunman Eric Harris' America Online Web site
Wednesday, a page separate from from the Trenchcoat Mafia site
found weeks ago. Researcher Rick Eaton said although they believed
the site was Harris', they could not confirm it with America
Online.
</P>
<P>
   An AOL spokeswoman told The Associated Press she couldn't
comment on whether it was linked to Harris but said material
relevant to the shooting would be forwarded to the FBI.
</P>
<P>
   Although the purported Harris site had been shut down by
Wednesday morning, the center's researchers had earlier found
attached to it a detailed and methodical guide to making pipe bombs
and napalm.
</P>
<P>
   The document's author, whose identity could not be determined,
researchers said, offers such tips as covering the floor with
newspaper when working with firework powder for bombs.
</P>
<P>
   ``. . . if you have a big black stain on yer carpet, mom and dad
might ask some questions,'' the document says.
</P>
<P>
   Even more disturbing is a discussion of ways to lace bombs with
shrapnel to maximize casualties. The author reports he tried fixing
nails onto the outside of some pipes and is saving that batch for
an upcoming event.
</P>
<P>
   ``. . . since they won't be used until NBK it'll be kind of hard
to report the results. You might try asking the survivors if they
got a good look at the bomb before it went off and then the
remains!'' the document reads. The document does not explain what
``NBK'' means.
</P>
<P>
   The documents could have been linked to the site after Tuesday's
shooting but that would have required someone to know the owner's
password or to have hacked into the account, Eaton said.

MONKEYS' OWN CELLS REPORTED TO REVERSE A NERVE DISORDER 
</HEADLINE>
  (with SCI-PARKINSONS-FETAL) 
(jt) 
 By PHILIP J. HILTS    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Scientists have reported that they reversed a Parkinson's-like
disease in monkeys by transplanting their own tissue into their
brains.
</P>
<P>
   The new approach, reported in the current issue of the journal
Neuron, avoids the problems that plague Parkinson's research
involving fetal-cell transplants. The cells used by the researchers
came from the monkeys' carotid bodies, small organs in the neck.
</P>
<P>
   Fetal cells must be taken from up to 10 discarded fetuses for
each treatment to reverse Parkinson's, a movement disorder, and
full-scale brain surgery is necessary.
</P>
<P>
   The work with the monkey cells was carried out in Spain by Dr.
Jose Lopez-Barneo of the University of Seville, Dr. M. Rosario
Luquin of the University of Navarre and their colleagues.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Arnon Rosenthal of the biotechnology company Genentech, who
is an expert on transplantation experiments in Parkinson's, said in
a telephone interview Wednesday that the new approach was ``very
exciting, and in principle far better than using fetal cells.''
Rosenthal said the cells used in the experiments produce 35 times
more of the key chemical involved in Parkinson's, the
neurotransmitter dopamine, than do fetal cells.
</P>
<P>
   The researchers said they would soon begin testing the procedure
in four people. Additional experiments have begun in five monkeys.
It will take a year or more to determine whether the method is
successful.
</P>
<P>
   ``It would be the ultimate in recycling,'' Rosenthal said.
</P>
<P>
   The Neuron article describes how the carotid cells in each of
two monkeys were taken with a simple incision in the neck, then
reinserted into the proper spot in the brain by using a very thin
needle.
</P>
<P>
   To test treatments for Parkinson's disease, scientists use
injections to induce damage in the area of the brain where movement
is coordinated. As in Parkinson's disease, the cells there
gradually lose their ability to produce dopamine, bringing on
symptoms like those of the disease.
</P>
<P>
   The monkeys had artificially induced Parkinson's on both sides
of their brains. But the fresh carotid cells were injected on only
one side, thus allowing experimenters to compare movement on the
animals' two sides after the transplant.

<P>
   Videotapes of the monkeys in the experiment show marked
improvement in hand movement after the transplants. The monkeys are
shown doing simple tasks such as reaching through a hole to grab
nuts on the other side. Before the new cells were put in, the
monkeys had great trouble reaching for and grasping the small nuts,
with each attempt to grasp and hold a single nut taking several
seconds.
</P>
<P>
   But after the cells on one side had be inserted, the hand linked
to that side of the brain soon was performing normally. The monkeys
used lightning jabs with the hand to get and eat four nuts quicker
than its other hand could even grasp one.
</P>
<P>
   The artificially induced Parkinson's had clearly been reversed,
the researcher said, and the change has continued in the animals
for six months after the transplants.

KEEPING ETHNIC TENSION FROM TURNING VIOLENT 
</HEADLINE>
  (Editorial Observer)

<TEXT>
<P>
   The New York Times said in an editorial for Thursday, April 22: &QL;
</P>
<P>
   If the world is permitted any nostalgia for Communism, let it
note that alongside the many horrors was the virtue of a relative
measure of ethnic peace. It is often so with empires _ and when
they fall, the ethnic, religious and nationalist conflicts they
smothered with their harsh repression can erupt. The fall of
communism, and the end of American and Soviet sponsorship of
political wars in the Third World, have made these ethnic conflicts
into the face of war today, exemplified by the former Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
   But not every nation with a tense mix of ethnicities has slipped
into violence. Romania and Hungary, two nations that border
Yugoslavia, are trying to manage conflicts surrounding the
Hungarian minority in Romania peacefully. The same is true with the
Hungarian minority living in Slovakia. Many former Soviet nations
are arriving at democratic ways to deal with the large Russian
populations in their midst. Latvia, for example, has now agreed to
remove most barriers to citizenship for the one-third of its
residents who are ethnic Russians. And while several ethnic
enclaves of the former Soviet Union, like Chechnya and the ethnic
Armenian region of Nagorno-Karabakh, have fought separatist wars,
many other enclaves have not.
</P>
<P>
   History was one thing that made Yugoslavia different. In the
Balkans, the ebb and flow of empires over the centuries _ Ottoman,
Austro-Hungarian and others _ left a long cycle of killings and
revenge. The identity of each ethnic group, particularly the Serbs,
was largely shaped by memories of victimization, military defeat
and humiliation, leaving people susceptible to hate propaganda.
This is not just ancient history, as World War II saw mass killings
of Serbs at the hands of Croats and, to a far lesser extent,
Muslims.
</P>
<P>
   Yet the Yugoslavia that emerged from the war was a multi-ethnic
state, with high rates of intermarriage. The country's strongman,
Tito, who was half-Croat and half-Slovene, permitted no public
discussion of ethnic tensions. Communist ideology promoted
universalism. Class, not ethnicity, mattered. ``Brotherhood and
Unity'' was Tito's slogan. He balanced the demands of various
ethnic groups, and used Yugoslavs' consciousness of their
victimhood to unite them as a small country standing up to Stalin.
He also used repression, clamping down on various outbreaks of
Serbian, Croatian and Albanian nationalism and purging or jailing
the leading proponents.
</P>
<P>
   The positive side of Tito's control was that people felt secure
that they would not become ethnic victims. But after his death in
1980, the rules changed. Yugoslavia was governed by a rotating
presidency, and there was constant uncertainty about whether the
next ruler would have a particular ethnic tilt. The new leaders
also permitted Serbs, always the largest and most powerful group,
to express their grievances in public.
</P>
<P>
   The single most important factor in Yugoslavia's violence,
however, was the emergence of Slobodan Milosevic, a leader willing
to destroy his country to keep himself in power. Ethnic conflicts
do not explode on their own. They are exploited by ruthless leaders
who want power, land or treasure.
</P>
<P>
   The rise of Milosevic threatened non-Serb minorities such as
Croats and Bosnian Muslims, who then seceded from Yugoslavia. But
since the new nations had Serbian minorities, Serbs grew nervous,
allowing Milosevic to use propaganda to exploit their fears and
turn them into killers.
</P>
<P>
   Milosevic had the tools to do this, because Yugoslavia never
shook off its Communist system. The same powerful and
well-controlled structures Tito used to repress nationalism _ the
party, Interior Ministry, army and media _ were intact and
available for Milosevic to employ in the service of hate.
</P>
<P>
   Other ethnically mixed nations of the former Communist world
have been more fortunate. Few other ethnic groups in the region can
match the Serbs for their sense of humiliation and victimization _
sentiments that unscrupulous leaders can turn into hate. The
Hungarians in Slovakia and Romania, for instance, worry about
agricultural policy and establishing a university in their
language. They do not worry about mass killing.
</P>
<P>
   Political factors also matter. While Milosevic promised Serbs a
better life through ethnic cleansing, the leaders of Hungary,
Romania and Slovakia held out the promise of joining Europe. These
leaders were essentially told that they had no chance of NATO or
European Union membership until they solved their ethnic problems.
Similar statements helped persuade governments of the Baltic States
to treat their Russian minorities more justly. It is not only the
heavy hand of imperial rule that can impose ethnic cooperation. In
most circumstances, the desire for democracy and economic growth
can do the same.

AMERICAN AND PHILADELPHIA STOCK EXCHANGES CANCELS MERGER PLANS 
</HEADLINE>
   (af)  
 By RICHARD A. OPPEL Jr.   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The American Stock Exchange and Philadelphia Stock Exchange have
terminated their planned merger, according to people close to the
negotiations.
</P>
<P>
   The collapse of the merger, which is expected to be announced as
early as Thursday, comes as federal officials investigate whether
various practices by the options industry inhibit competition and
cause investors to pay higher prices.
</P>
<P>
   When the two exchanges announced the proposed merger in June,
officials had hoped it would allow them to share technology and
otherwise reduce costs by bringing trading under one roof.
</P>
<P>
   But the economic reasoning for a merger has eroded, people close
to the talks said, partly because of pressure from regulators to
allow multiple listing of options _ that is, different exchanges
trading the same options _ as well as from the anticipated arrival
of competition from a new electronic options-trading exchange.
</P>
<P>
   After it became apparent that a merger was not going to occur,
the exchanges discussed other alliances or combinations, but so far
those talks have not produced any results, people close to the
talks said.
</P>
<P>
   The likely dissolution of the merger was first reported by The
Philadelphia Inquirer on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   After the planned merger was announced last year, the Justice
Department requested information about the combination. And two
months ago, the chairman of the Securities and Exchange Commission,
Arthur Levitt, asked the heads of the nation's four options
exchanges to cooperate in opening the options markets to greater
competition, including the integration of electronic options
markets.
</P>
<P>
   One such exchange, backed by a number of Wall Street firms and
called the International Securities Exchange, applied to the SEC in
February to begin trading as early as next year.
</P>
<P>
   The American Stock Exchange, which was itself acquired last year
by the National Association of Securities Dealers, which also
operates the NASDAQ market, informed the Philadelphia exchange in a
letter April 6 that it believed a merger was no longer feasible. A
person close to the negotiations denied that the deal collapsed
because of pressure from the Justice Department or the SEC.
</P>
<P>
   According to this person, the merger was falling apart ``before
those things came into play. The economics and viability of the
combination just didn't pencil out.''
</P>
<P>
   The end of merger talks comes three months after the Chicago
Board Options Exchange canceled its merger with the Pacific Stock
Exchange, citing technological concerns and antitrust questions,
including requests by the Justice Department for information about
the deal.

MARY C. ROCKEFELLER, 91, GOVERNOR'S EX-WIFE
</HEADLINE>
  (bl)  
 By ERIC PACE   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Mary Clark Rockefeller, who was prominent in the
education of nurses and was New York state's first lady when she
was married to Gov. Nelson Rockefeller, died Wednesday at her home
on Manhattan's Upper East Side. She was 91.
</P>
<P>
   Political and social worlds were shocked in 1961 when governor
and Mrs. Rockefeller announced their separation after 31 years of
marriage. Their divorce and his quick remarriage, in 1963, to
Margaretta Fitler (Happy) Murphy, caused a furor and turned many
Republicans into opponents of the governor.
</P>
<P>
   Rockefeller unsuccessfully sought the 1964 Republican
presidential nomination, and many political commentators said that
his chances had been damaged by his divorce and remarriage to Mrs.
Murphy, who was the mother of four children, just five weeks after
she had divorced her first husband.
</P>
<P>
   Rockefeller, who failed in another attempt to gain the
presidential nomination in 1968, remained governor until 1973. He
went on to be vice president from 1974 to 1977 under President
Gerald Ford. He died in 1979.
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Rockefeller, the former Mary Todhunter Clark, was known to
her family and friends as Tod. She was born in the Germantown
section of Philadelphia on June 17, 1907, and raised in the
suburban community of Bala-Cynwyd on land that had been in her
family since it was acquired from William Penn. She was the second
of eight children of Percy Hamilton Clark, a lawyer, and the former
Elizabeth Roberts, daughter of George B. Roberts, who was a former
president of the Pennsylvania Railroad and a member of an old
Pennsylvania family.
</P>
<P>
   Young Tod was tall, slim and hazel-eyed, and she charmed Nelson
Rockefeller, a grandson of John D. Rockefeller Sr., when they were
young people summering in Maine with their families.
</P>
<P>
   Cary Reich, in his book ``The Life of Nelson Rockefeller: Worlds
to Conquer 1908-58'' (1996, Doubleday), wrote of the start of their
romance: ` ``She is always full of good fun and never dull,' he
told his parents. He was captivated by her energy, her athleticism,
her willingness to try anything. Nelson's friend Bill Alton, who
stayed with him during those summers, remembers that `he was always
coming up with something to do _ a hayride, or something like that
_ and Tod was always part of it. She'd fall into the spirit and
carry out her end of it. She wasn't a shrinking violet.' ''
</P>
<P>
   Tod Clark attended Foxcroft in Middleburg, Va., studied at the
Sorbonne without receiving a degree, returned to Philadelphia, made
her debut and became active in the Junior League.
</P>
<P>
   In 1929, Nelson Rockefeller, who was then an undergraduate at
Dartmouth, made it known that he was going to marry her. Afterward,
as Ron Chernow wrote in his 1988 book ``Titan: the Life of John D.
Rockefeller Sr.'' (Random House), Nelson and Tod went to see his
grandfather, ``who gave his blessing after golfing with this young
lady from the Main Line suburbs of Philadelphia.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Tod struck observers as witty and intelligent, an excellent
mimic and fine sportswoman, if rather cool and self-contained.'' In
1929, she also traveled to Egypt with Nelson's parents while he was
still at Dartmouth.
</P>
<P>
   In 1930, soon after his graduation, the young couple, both in
their early 20s, married in Bala-Cynwyd. His father, John D.
Rockefeller Jr., provided them with a trip around the world and a
Dutch Colonial farmhouse in Westchester County. The house had a
door bearing deep gashes, which, according to local legend, had
been cut by the sabers of Hessian soldiers during the American
Revolution.
</P>
<P>
   As a young matron, Mrs. Rockefeller began following in the
footsteps of her mother, who was a member of the board of
Polyclinic Hospital in Philadelphia and served on the nurses
residence committee of Bryn Mawr Hospital.
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Rockefeller held volunteer posts in the field of nurses'
education for years, while managing family homes in Manhattan,
Westchester County, Maine and Washington.
</P>
<P>
   In 1932 she became a volunteer at the Bellevue Schools of
Nursing; two schools, one for women and one for men, which were
jointly administered with Bellevue Hospital in Manhattan. She was
on the schools' board for years and was the board's president for a
time. By 1953 the schools were united, in a building on East 26th
Street. They ceased operation in 1969.
</P>
<P>
   In 1959, Mrs. Rockefeller was given an award for ``her 27 years
of outstanding achievement on behalf of the nursing profession and
the health care of the American people'' from the New York County
Registered Nurses. In 1971, she received the National League of
Nursing's distinguished service award for her work as a member of
its board.
</P>
<P>
   In 1980, she was awarded an honorary degree of Doctor of Humane
Letters by Hunter College for her efforts on behalf of nursing
education. She had served on special committees at Yale, Columbia
and the University of Pennsylvania to examine nursing education in
junior and community colleges.
</P>
<P>
   From 1951 to 1956 she was a member of a national panel, the
Defense Advisory Committee on Women in the Services, and headed its
subcommittee on professional services. She was a member of the
National Advisory Health Council, a group advising the U.S. Public
Health Service, from 1955 to 1959.

KILLER'S FRIENDS TELL MOURNERS OF THEIR SHOCK 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By KIM COBB 
c.1999 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   LITTLETON, Colo. _ After the keening of bagpipes, fresh tears
and a few prayers, the parish priest at Light of the World Catholic
Church turned the microphone over to the audience Wednesday in
hopes that it would prove cathartic for a community grieving the
loss of 14 students and a teacher.
</P>
<P>
   The people hardest hit by Tuesday's school massacre came
together with parents and teachers for a prayer service at a
Catholic church little more than a mile from the deadly campus
scene. Many teen-agers arrived locked arm-in-arm, while others came
with their parents and _ most ominously _ some ashen-faced parents
arrived, accompanied by no children.
</P>
<P>
   Many in the audience were stunned, however, when two young girls
took their turn at the front of the church and introduced
themselves as friends of one of the shooters.
</P>
<P>
   ``We both knew Eric Harris,'' said red-eyed Nicole Markham,
nodding to her friend, Kristen Thiebault. ``We didn't see any signs
of this. We're just sorry they did this!'' she cried.
</P>
<P>
   ``We all lost friends yesterday,'' added Thiebault. ``Some of
them committed suicide,'' she said, referring to Harris and his
partner, Dylan Klebold, who walked into the school Tuesday armed
with several types of guns and explosives, killing 13 and wounding
23 before taking their own lives.
</P>
<P>
   ``We did not know they were capable of this. They were just the
sweetest guys on earth,'' Thiebault said. ``All of our friends are
still trying to figure this out, to figure out how they could have
done this.''
</P>
<P>
   Sherry Markham, draped her arm around her daughter's shoulder
and asked the group not to assume the kids who are being referred
to as the ``Trenchcoat Mafia'' had any knowledge of what was
coming.
</P>
<P>
   ``If any of these kids knew anything about it they wouldn't have
been in school getting shot at,'' Markham said. ``I don't know what
to say. We don't know why they snapped. Don't hold it against us.''
</P>
<P>
   Columbine students say the suspected shooters were isolated by
their own choices, courting contempt with their outrageous clothing
and makeup and hateful rhetoric. They were, by many accounts,
picked on and ridiculed. If Tuesday was about getting even, many of
the survivors are apparently struggling with questions about their
own culpability.
</P>
<P>
   Several of the young people who spoke talked about the societal
divisions within their high school, how they had previously judged
and been judged by appearance and popularity. ``I'm never going to
do that again,'' weeped one girl. ``I want to know all of you!''
</P>
<P>
   But students like Harris and Klebold reportedly saw one group as
their particular enemies _ the student athletes they dismissed as
``jocks.'' Senior Eddie Olson knew he was in the enemy camp, and it
was eating at him that he ran to safety when other kids ended up
taking the bullets he thinks were meant for him.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm sorry,'' he said. ``I didn't find out until later that the
people who did this were going after people like me,'' Olson
sniffed.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm sorry I ran out of there when I was part of the group
being targeted,'' Olson said. ``I'm sorry.''
</P>
<P>
   A middle-aged Vietnam veteran, proudly wearing the medals he'd
earned, stepped up to warn the Columbine students not to swallow
their emotions as he had upon returning from the carnage of war.
Seek the help and counseling that's out there, he urged.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was about your age when I was in Vietnam,'' he said. ``When
I came back there wasn't no help,'' said the man, who did not
identify himself.
</P>
<P>
   ``I let 20-some years go by. I wasted my life with drugs and
drinking. Don't let this happen to you!''
</P>
<P>
   Many of the Columbine students are still wearing obvious signs
of shock. ``I'm not eating, not sleeping,'' confessed 15-year-old
Andrea Launer, who was ``stuck in the lunch room'' when the
shooting started. Most of the students who died were trapped either
there or in the library.
</P>
<P>
   She collapsed into tears, explaining that she had a good friend
in intensive care with a gunshot wound to the head. She and her
friends trudged up the hill together toward Light of the World
Catholic Church, looking for solace.
</P>
<P>
   Denver-area community groups and churches were scheduling prayer
services and memorials to support the Columbine kids and their
families. But the kids also were working to heal themselves, with
spontaneous expressions of emotion all over this little community.
</P>
<P>
   At midafternoon, large crowds of teen-agers began gathering at
Clement Park (near the high school) to hug each other and share
their agony involving the 15 people who they are beginning to
accept have died. Some of them sang.
</P>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR; An hour after dark, with a spring storm blowing through,
people were still streaming into Clement Park to leave mementoes of
sorrow and affection for the children of Columbine High. It was
raining, but many people stood with the cold rain falling softly on
their faces, blurring the tears that just wouldn't stop.
</P>
<P>
   Teddy bears, high school trophies, poems and hundreds of
bouquets of flowers are growing by the hour. About 100 people
formed an impromptu silent prayer circle at midevening. Some stood
wrapped in blankets, some had coats and many stood with bare heads
and raw emotions.
</P>
<P>
   At dusk, people were gathering in Civic Center Park in downtown
Denver, as well. Denver Mayor Wellington E. Webb echoed the
concerns that are being repeated throughout the small community
surrounding Columbine High School.
</P>
<P>
   ``As adults we send out children to school because we want them
to be safe and learn and take our place. As students, we go to
learn, to enjoy a special youthfulness that comes but once in a
lifetime,'' the mayor said.
</P>
<P>
   ``But for many, that life ended abruptly and tragically and even
for those who continue to live, they will see and remember
something that will be with them for the rest of their lives.
</P>
<P>
   Denver area residents came together Wednesday evening because,
in many cases, they didn't know what else to do, he said. ``We know
we feel better when we're around each other. But we also know we
have to find a way to resolve our conflict with others in
nonviolent ways.'' &QL;

 NEW YORK: to 1959.  
<TEXT>
<P>
   For his part, Nelson Rockefeller held important Washington jobs
in the 1940s and 1950s. But Mrs. Rockefeller showed an aversion to
the spotlight and was not much in the public eye until her husband
set about trying to become New York's governor, and succeeded by
unseating W. Averell Harriman in 1958. Mrs. Rockefeller was plunged
into a world to which she had had no previous exposure.
</P>
<P>
   Joe Alex Morris wrote in his 1960 book ``Nelson Rockefeller: a
Biography'' about Rockefeller's first campaign for governor: ``The
nominee's family turned out to be good campaigners. Mrs.
Rockefeller went with him almost everywhere.'' But she ``tried to
keep the family's private affairs separate from her husband's
political career,'' Morris said.
</P>
<P>
   He added: ``She could be tart and blunt when she thought
reporters were too inquisitive and once when she was being
questioned about her political background and was asked if she had
ever been in Albany, she snapped: `No, I haven't. Have you?'''
</P>
<P>
   Reich, in his 1996 biography of Nelson Rockefeller, said of Mrs.
Rockefeller's campaigning before the 1958 election: ``One morning,
during a tour of western New York, she went to a local diner for
breakfast. Such a stop might be an occasion for garrulous
glad-handing for her husband, but not so for Tod. Settling in on a
counter stool, she was greeted by the cook, a gnarled fellow in a
food-begrimed apron.
</P>
<P>
   ```What'll you have?' he asked her. `Well,' Tod sniffed, `the
first thing I'll have is a clean apron on you, my man.'''
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Rockefeller worked hard at being a good first lady. She
continued to be a companion of the governor on his political trips
around New York state, and on journeys he made in his official
capacity, until just a few months before the couple announced their
separation in November 1961.
</P>
<P>
   The end of her marriage brought her unwanted attention. Looking
back in 1996, Geoffrey C. Ward wrote in The New York Times Book
Review that Rockefeller's ``marriage to Mary Todhunter Clark, of
Philadelphia's Main Line, produced five children but soured because
of his wife's unease with the public life she hadn't bargained for
and her unhappiness over his fondness for young women, which in our
more intrusive times might have aborted his career.''
</P>
<P>
   After separating in 1961, the Rockefellers divorced in 1962.
Mrs. Rockefeller obtained the divorce in Reno, Nev., on grounds of
extreme mental cruelty. The governor entered a formal denial of the
allegations, but in effect did not actively contest the suit. As
part of the Rockefellers' divorce settlement, he kept one floor of
their three-floor penthouse apartment on the Upper East Side and
she kept the two upper floors.
</P>
<P>
   Nelson and Tod Rockefeller experienced tragedy in 1961 when
their 23-year-old son Michael, who was deeply interested in
primitive cultures, died while on an anthropological expedition in
New Guinea.
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Rockefeller is survived by two sons, Rodman C. of Manhattan
and Steven C. of Middlebury, Vt.; two daughters, Ann R. Roberts and
Mary Morgan Callard, both of Manhattan; 15 grandchildren; 23
great-grandchildren; and two brothers, John R. Clark of
Philadelphia and Dr. Thomas W. Clark of Gwynedd, Pa.
</P>
<P>
   Although Tod Rockefeller was very serious about her work in
nursing education and about other aspects of her life, as time
passed she retained what Peter Collier and David Horowitz called,
in their 1976 book ``The Rockefellers: An American
Dynasty''(NAL-Dutton), ``an athletic grace and whimsical good humor
the world at large didn't often see.''
</P>
<P>
   Collier and Horowitz wrote that Mrs. Rockefeller's niece, Marion
Rockefeller Weber, remembered ``seeking her out time after time,
while she knelt at work in her gardens, to ask her questions and
wait for the amusing replies to float up like bubbles from under
the voluminous sunbonnet.''
</P>
<P>
   And more than once over the years, Mrs. Rockefeller surprised
those around her by dancing the Charleston.

 &HT;    Harvey shows he'll attend Florida
 &HT;    By Chip Towers
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   CUTHBERT, Ga. _ Secrets don't stay secrets for long in this
small Southwest Georgia town, so there was very little suspense
Wednesday when Randolph-Clay High School star Donnell Harvey signed
a basketball scholarship with the University of Florida.
</P>
<P>
   But the signing did little to rob from the excitement, as the
normally quiet and reserved Harvey put on a well-choreographed show
for the small gathering of classmates, teachers and media
representatives who attended his news conference in an auditorium
at the high school. Dressed in black pants, black shirt and a
colorful tie, the 6-foot-8, 220-pound Harvey stood on the stage,
read a long prepared statement and, after announcing his intention
to sign with the Gators, pulled out a blue Florida T-shirt, a white
cap with a big Gator on the bill and a stuffed Gator toy.
</P>
<P>
   Harvey donned the cap and T-shirt and then pressed the toy's
paw, which made it play the Florida fight song. Moments later,
Harvey played the song again, led the audience in doing the ``Gator
chomp,'' then said, ``If you're not part of the Gators, then you're
Gator bait,'' he said, reciting an oft-repeated phrase of football
coach Steve Spurrier.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is important to me,'' Harvey said, ``to attend a university
where I would have the opportunity to play in the Final Four of the
NCAA (Tournament),'' said Harvey, the Naismith and USA Today
national player of the year who averaged 23 points and 14 rebounds
as a senior.
</P>
<P>
   According to school officials, Harvey, who chose Florida over
Auburn, Georgia and Clemson, has qualified for admission to
Florida.
</P>
<P>
   Harvey did reveal some details about his decision, saying he
always thought that he would play at Georgia.
</P>
<P>
   ``There was a time when I truly thought that I would wear the
red and black and play for the Bulldogs,'' Harvey said. ``The
turning point was when Jumaine (Jones) announced he was turning
pro. I always had the idea of me and Jumaine being on the same
team.''

 &HT;    House not packed for Hurricanes
 &HT;    By Jeff Schultz
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Too often this season, Greensboro, N.C., has had a
problem. When the Hurricanes arrive, everybody evacuates.
</P>
<P>
   The Carolina Hurricanes, the NHL's biggest secret, open the
playoffs tonight against the Boston Bruins at the Greensboro
Coliseum. If you care, that puts you ahead of most in Greensboro,
approximately a 90-minute drive from the team's home base in
Raleigh, where a new arena for the team is still under
construction.
</P>
<P>
   The nomadic existence has not been pleasant for players, who
received a weather upgrade when the team moved from Hartford but
took a step back in fan support. Carolina drew a league-low average
of 8,188 this season. Team officials were so pessimistic about
attendance this season that they reduced the Coliseum's capacity
from 21,000 to 11,059 by masking the upper level with a black
curtain. The curtain will remain in place for the playoffs.
</P>
<P>
   ``In our business, if you have just one empty seat, you're
disappointed,'' said general manager Jim Rutherford, who long
played in hockey-crazed Detroit. ``But if people really understood
our situation, they would see our fans are good fans for going
through all that travel.''
</P>
<P>
   That's the spin from management. But after the team drew only
6,790 to a late-season game against Washington, left winger Gary
Roberts said, ``If we have only 6,000 fans in our building for the
playoffs, I think maybe we should play all the games on the road.
Obviously, it was disappointing to the players.''
</P>
<P>
   The Hurricanes remain optimistic about the Raleigh market. But
they are resolved to starting next season with a seven- or
eight-game road trip, Rutherford said, while the arena is
completed, after several construction delays. Carolina will not go
back to Greensboro, which showed itself to be a minor-league market
that won't embrace NHL ticket prices for the short term.
</P>
<P>
   It hasn't been all bad for the Hurricanes. They benefited from
playing in the weak Southeast Divison by winning the title with a
modest record of 34-30-18. With it came a No. 3 seed and home-ice
advantage, despite the worst record of Eastern Conference playoff
teams. The Bruins were 39-30-13, although the teams split their
five-game series (2-2-1).

   HOMEGROWN: GEORGIANS ON TOUR
</P>
<P>
   LaGrange's Allen Doyle is the hottest story on the Senior PGA
Tour. His win Sunday in the PGA Seniors Championship in Palm Beach
Gardens, Fla., a major championship for the over-50 circuit, was
his second of the year and pushed him to No. 1 on the Senior Tour
money list with $666,724. The largest paycheck of Doyle's short pro
career ($315,000) _ he was the oldest rookie in PGA Tour history at
age 47 _ came after a final-round 64 that defeated Vicente
Fernandez by two strokes. It was the lowest final round in PGA
Seniors history and even included a double bogey.
</P>
<P>
   Fellow senior Dana Quigley said, ``Allen Doyle played maybe the
greatest round of golf he'll ever play in his lifetime, especially
on a course like this.''
</P>
<P>
   Doyle has no rest in his immediate future. He's playing in
Charlotte this week, Birmingham next week and in Atlanta for the
Nationwide Championship at The Golf Club of Georgia the week after.
</P>
<P>
   Marietta's Joe Inman tied for 11th at Palm Beach National, at
5-under-par. Jim Dent of Augusta tied for 34th at 4-over.
Marietta's Larry Nelson, after opening with a 76, tied for 43rd.
Former champion Larry Mowry of Cumming tied for 55th.
</P>
<P>
   _ PGA Tour: Sea Island's Davis Love III had to withdraw from the
MCI Classic because of back problems.... Former Marietta high
school player Bob Tway tied for eighth, three strokes back on a
final-round 67, and earned $75,000. Larry Mize of Columbus tied for
27th at 3-under, slipping through a final-round 74. Scott Dunlap of
Alpharetta tied for 32nd at 2-under.
</P>
<P>
   _ Nike Tour: Vidalia's Paul Claxton was the low Georgia finisher
at Shreveport, tying for 14th, five shots behind winner Bob Heintz.
</P>
<P>
   GARCIA MAKES PRO DEBUT
</P>
<P>
   It's quite a time for Spain in the world golf picture. First,
Jose Maria Olazabal wins a second Masters. Now Sergio Garcia, after
finishing as the low amateur at the Masters, makes his pro debut in
the Peugeot Spanish Open in El Prat, Spain.
</P>
<P>
   The 19-year-old Garcia's final practice round for the tournament
was his last as an amateur. He teamed with Seve Ballesteros to win
a friendly 2,500 peseta match against Olazabal and Miguel Angel
Jimenez. And how's this for irony? While not as spectacular as
Justin Rose's last shot as an amateur at the British Open last
July, Garcia chipped in from 50 feet for a birdie at the 18th, then
officially turned pro.
</P>
<P>
   ``I predict that he will have a great career and that one day he
will be a Masters champion,'' Ballesteros said.
</P>
<P>
   Olazabal, making his first appearance since Augusta, said, ``The
press are thirsty for him, but I just don't think we should push
him. I know I'm asking for an impossible thing here, but if we
leave the kid alone he will have more chance to improve as a player
and mature as a person.''

 &HT;    Webb finds winning touch
 &HT;    By Michelle Hiskey
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ At 24, Karrie Webb might appear a bit young to be
reinventing herself. Four years ago, she was the Australian rookie
who won the LPGA money title. She won five tournaments over the
next two seasons, a model of consistency who rarely finished out of
the top 20 in any tournament and no worse than fourth in annual
earnings.
</P>
<P>
   But last winter, Webb decided a change was in order. She usually
vacations Down Under, away from her clubs, but instead she spent
time working with her coach and analyzing her swing. She switched
to cross-handed putting, and instead of ``going in blind'' to what
her swing might produce in the first few tournaments, she couldn't
wait to see how her hard work would pay off.
</P>
<P>
   With a dominance akin to David Duval's, Webb has won three of
her seven tournaments and will try to add another one this week at
the Chick-fil-A Charity Championship in Stockbridge. She hasn't
been surprised at her great play, just at how quickly she has
resumed being the player to beat each week.
</P>
<P>
   ``I want to ride the wave as long as it goes,'' Webb said
Wednesday, ``and when I'm not playing as well, hopefully it won't
be that long before I am again.''
</P>
<P>
   Webb has played 22 of 27 rounds under par, for a scoring average
of 68.67 strokes per round. With rounds of 63-67-64-68 at the
Australian Ladies Masters, she set the LPGA scoring record for 54
and 72 holes. Her winnings of $486,996 places her almost $200,000
ahead of Juli Inkster. Her worst finish is eighth.
</P>
<P>
   Webb always has been a consistent ball striker, hitting 77
percent of her greens in regulation this year, but in the past she
has gotten discouraged by missed birdie opportunities and a finicky
putter. Trading in her Odyssey blade for a Scotty Cameron model,
Webb also switched the position of her hands in her putting grip.
Cross-handed putting once was considered a touring pro's most
desperate measure, but today plenty of players use the style. For
Webb, the result is a more consistent roll and more putts made.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wouldn't say I was a bad putter, just streaky,'' she said.
``This year's been different: I feel I have made more than my share
of putts, which is the key to why I've shot so low.''
</P>
<P>
   While Webb said she felt fine about her last two seasons, that's
not the word on Tour.
</P>
<P>
   ``Someone commented that she was disappointed in how she
finished last year, and I think that made her mad and gave her more
goals inside,'' said Nancy Lopez, who knows what it's like to be in
the zone that Webb occupies.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everything just seems easy,'' is the way Lopez describes it.
``The game seems very, very simple almost. The hole looks big, the
fairways wide, and you can't do anything wrong, and so you play
very aggressively.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I have had all parts of my game there every week,'' Webb said.
``There's not been one part of my game that I didn't want to face.
I've never gone through a period as long as this where everything
seems right.

 &HT;    Tough year on Tour for caddies
 &HT;    By Glenn Sheeley and Michelle Hiskey
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Caddies have become an endangered species on the PGA
Tour. Tiger Woods last month dumped Mike ``Fluff'' Cowan, who
worked with him since his pro debut in 1996. Mark O'Meara is
through with Jerry ``Higgy'' Higgenbotham, who was on the bag for
two major championships last year. Jim Furyk parted with Steve
Duplantis and quickly pulled Fluff off the unemployment line.
</P>
<P>
   That's a looper getting a new looper, if you're keeping score at
home.
</P>
<P>
   The latest victim is Lorne Duncan, who carried Jesper Parnevik's
clubs. On Sunday at the MCI Classic, Duncan got a harsh lesson in
loyalty.
</P>
<P>
   After the final round, Parnevik was asked by PGA Tour rules
official Slugger White if he had, as someone claimed, used his
glove to brush away something from his putting line. Parnevik said
he could not recall doing it, but Duncan jumped into the
conversation to say that he had. Parnevik fired Duncan on the spot.
</P>
<P>
   The smart caddies are the ones who maintain low profiles,
realizing they are one bad read or wrong club from a desk job.
Woods' new caddie, Steve Williams, has an understanding with his
boss not to conduct interviews. On the range this week at
Greensboro, many caddies have taken a similar approach.
</P>
<P>
   A few years ago John Daly fired Greg Rita, now with Scott Hoch,
supposedly for going behind his back to try to work for Woods.
</P>
<P>
   The most pivotal caddie breakup of recent years was David
Duval's amicable parting with Jeff Webber on the eve of the 1997
PGA Championship at Winged Foot. Duval hired Mitch Knox, a former
caddie master at Atlanta National Golf Club. In two years, Duval
has won 11 times in 35 events.
</P>
<P>
   Day gets in focus
</P>
<P>
   Glen Day used to be known for the time he took to finish a
round, earning the nickname ``All Day.'' Quickening his pace, Day
was noticed for the pin, featuring photos of two daughters, on his
cap. On Sunday at Hilton Head, Day earned his first PGA Tour
victory Sunday by defeating Payne Stewart and Jeff Sluman with a
35-foot birdie on the first hole of a playoff. Now, he could become
famous for his malapropisms. Describing the burden lifted by the
victory, he said, ``Now I don't have to deal with that astigmatism
any more.''
</P>
<P>
   PGA Seniors on move?
</P>
<P>
   Allen Doyle's amazing final round considered, crowds last week
at the PGA Seniors Championship in Palm Beach Gardens, Fla., looked
more like your standard Nike Tour event. The total gallery for the
entire week was estimated at 25,000. With numbers like that at the
PGA of America's headquarters town, something has to change. You
can expect the tournament to be moved to a later point in the
spring and to different courses around the country. Moving it also
would allow the recently snowed-out Tradition a kinder spot on the
calendar.

POLICE REMOVE 15 BODIES FROM SCHOOL SHOOTING SCENE 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By ARMANDO VILLAFRANCA 
and LISA TEACHEY 
c.1999 Houston Chronicle 
<TEXT>
<P>
   LITTLETON, Colo. _ After a gut-wrenching, room-by-room search by
bomb experts and crime investigators, the bodies of 14 teens and
one adult were finally removed from blood-spattered Columbine High
School late Wednesday, scene of the worst school shooting in
Colorado history.
</P>
<P>
   Among the 15 dead were the two gunmen, identified as senior-year
students, who attacked faculty and fellow students Tuesday with
bombs and gunfire before killing themselves in a second floor
library.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was devastating. I've been a cop for 27 years and a SWAT
officer for 11 years and this was clearly the most devastating and
traumatic scene I have ever seen,'' said Sgt. George Hinkle of the
Lakeside Police SWAT team, among 100 officers called to the
shooting.
</P>
<P>
   The victims included a computer teacher who coached the girl's
basketball team, 11 male students and four female students. Family
members had endured a nearly 24-hour wait before they were told
whose bodies were lying inside. Authorities withheld names
Wednesday although some families confirmed some victims.
</P>
<P>
   The gunmen, who began the rampage at about 11:30 a.m., killed
two students in the parking lot. The two, wearing black trench
coats and masks, detonated handmade bombs and shot students at
point-blank range with shotguns and semiautomatic rifles as they
roamed the school for several hours. Many students were trapped
inside as the ordeal unfolded.
</P>
<P>
   The gunmen were identified Wednesday as Eric David Harris, 18,
and Dylan Bennet Klebold, 17, seniors who belonged to a social
group calling themselves the ``Trenchcoat Mafia.'' Other students
said the two collected guns, disliked athletes and minorities and
appeared infatuated with Nazi lore. Officials said Wednesday they
had no evidence minorities were specifically targeted.
</P>
<P>
   The parents of the two gunmen, in statements issued by their
lawyers, expressed regret to the victims' families and the
community and said they were struggling as well to understand what
happened.
</P>
<P>
   The gunmen kept SWAT officers at bay until almost 4 p.m. while
many of the school's 2,000 students hid under desks, in closets and
classrooms.
</P>
<P>
   Officials said Wednesday that 16 of the 23 wounded remained in
seven area hospitals.
</P>
<P>
   Although investigators believe Harris and Klebold acted alone
inside the school, investigators were questioning about eight to 10
fellow members of the ``Trenchcoat Mafia.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I think there was some evidence to suggest that there were
some other people that were aware. I think we have to pursue
vigorously, at least for the time being, that there were other
people involved in the planning,'' said District Attorney David J.
Thomas of the First Judicial District.
</P>
<P>
   Inside the school and in automobiles in the parking lot
authorities found 30 home-made explosive devices, including Molotov
cocktail-type bombs with matches as fuses and two-foot-long propane
tanks wrapped with nails and attached to pipe bombs. More
bomb-making materials were found in searches of the gunmen's homes.
</P>
<P>
   Jefferson County Sheriff John P. Stone said some of the bombs
were built with timers and designed to spray nails and shrapnel. He
said investigators had not determined if some of the bombs had been
hidden in the school before Tuesday's rampage or how the two
carried their arsenal into the school without being detected.
Witnesses said the two carried duffel bags.
</P>
<P>
   ``This was not something that was done overnight,'' Stone said.
``There was a lot of time planning this sort of thing.''
</P>
<P>
   Investigators also seized a sawed-off shotgun and a computer
from the home of one of the gunmen. Stone would not describe the
material found to make the bombs, but said the items were commonly
available.
</P>
<P>
   Stone said eight or nine semi-automatic magazines were found in
the school along with numerous spent shotgun shells. The bodies of
Harris and Klebold were found within a few feet of each other with
undetonated bombs nearby. A .9 mm semiautomatic rifle, two shotguns
with their stocks sawed off and a semiautomatic pistol were at
their sides.
</P>
<P>
   The bodies of the gunmen were in the library where most of the
carnage took place. Of the 13 victims killed, including Dave
Sanders, the coach, 10 were in the library. The body of the coach
was found in a closet near the library.
</P>
<P>
   Steve Davis, Jefferson County Sheriff's spokesman, said the
investigators were unable to begin the grisly task of examining the
crime scene until after bomb experts swept through the school and
surrounding area searching for undetonated bombs.
</P>
<P>
   One problem was the hundreds of backpacks left behind as
students fled the school.
</P>
<P>
   Davis said SWAT officers from various police departments were
inside the school within 20 minutes of a report of the shooting,
but were hampered by a lack of information about the assailants or
their numbers. About 15 minutes before the shooting began, he said,
a bomb was exploded away from the campus as a diversion.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had 2,000 students in there and no way to identify who the
suspects were,'' Davis said.
</P>
<P>
   Davis said three deputies _ exchanged gunfire with the suspects,
including deputy Neil Gardner, assigned as security at the school,
who remained inside during the ordeal. The other two deputies,
Deputy Paul Smoker and Lt. Terry Manwaring, exchanged gunfire with
one of the suspects when he appeared on the roof of the school.
</P>
<P>
   Hinkle said his officers had little information to act on by the
time they arrived at the scene at 12:46 p.m. Upon arriving, he said
his officers first spotted a sign in a window that read, ``Help,
I'm bleeding to death.''
</P>
<P>
   He said a student was holding his arms out of the window of the
second-story library and that the boy was rescued when an armored
car pulled underneath the window and two SWAT officers grabbed the
boy out of the window.
</P>
<P>
   Hinckle said he was unprepared for what he saw when he came upon
the crime scene. He said students and teachers were coming out of
closets, under desks and classrooms as officers made their way
through the school's halls. Officers found students calling for
help on cellular phones or using computers.
</P>
<P>
   Other officers described it as a scene from Dante's Inferno.
</P>
<P>
   Hinkle said he found two areas where propane bombs had been
detonated and the cafeteria floor was under four inches of water
from the school's indoor fire sprinkler system.
</P>
<P>
   ``When we train, we train for EDPs, (emotionally disturbed
people) and it is so rare to have multiple EDP suspects,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Hundreds of students and supporters gathered at a media staging
area at a nearby park to leave flowers and notes for the victims.
</P>
<P>
   Other students held a vigil at a red Acura car belonging to
Rachel Scott, a junior at the school and one of the victims in the
rampage, crying as they leaned on the car hood draped with flowers.
</P>
<P>
   Among them was Jessica Cave, a 16-year-old sophomore who hid in
a small science storage room with 25 to 30 other students for three
hours. The room was at the end of a stairway leading to the
cafeteria on the first floor.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was right on the other side of the wall,'' she said of the
gunfire erupting in the hallway.
</P>
<P>
   She said the students, standing shoulder to shoulder, remained
quiet with a teacher standing at the door using her body as a
barricade until they heard SWAT officers in the hall.
</P>
<P>
   Eric Viek, a senior who shared a video production class last
semester with the two suspects, said he gave police three videos he
had made with Harris and Kebold that he described as action-type
movies, but declined to give specifics about their content or
message.
</P>
<P>
   ``In their videos they were always in their trenchcoats. They
always wanted to be the intimidators. They always wanted to be the
good guys going after the bad guys. They wanted to be the heroes.''
</P>
<P>
   He said the two were loners who liked to listen to German music.
He said they would joke about planning a prank for the Class of
1999 and mentioned that Adolf Hitler's birthday was coming in a few
months. The attack happened on the birthday.
</P>
<P>
   He said he never thought about their plans as more than a
harmless prank.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am shocked at what they did yesterday. I did not think they
would do what they did yesterday,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Down here in the suburbs where things are a little quieter
there aren't too many people who want to stand out. They wanted to
stand out.''
</P>
<P>
   School officials said all schools in the Jefferson County Public
School system would reopen today, except Columbine. School
spokesman Rick Kaufman said all the schools were swept for
explosives and that security will be beefed at the entrances of
schools in the district, the largest in Colorado with 140 schools
and 89,000 students.
</P>
<P>
   Michelle DiManna, a math teacher and a 1989 graduate of
Columbine, said returning will be difficult.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just can't imagine going into my classroom and seeing the
missing seats,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's unnerving in some ways. I really want to go back there,
but in some ways, emotionally I don't want to go back there. The
innocence of Columbine High School is gone,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   She said she remembers the prom assembly last Friday when
Principal Frank DeAngelis reminded students to be careful on prom
night and talked about the students killed in accidents in previous
years.
</P>
<P>
   ``He didn't want to put another memorial on the wall at
Columbine,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Nick Baumgart, a 17-year-old senior who was in Klebold's Boy
Scout troop, said the tragedy extends beyond the loss of lives and
will be carried among the living at Columbine.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't want my last day of high school to be that day. It
will be hard but I don't want that to be the last day,'' he said.

PRESSURE IS ON KHABIBULIN IN PLAYOFFS

 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHOENIX - He's enjoyed his finest season as an NHL goaltender,
winning a personal-best 32 games and posting a career-best 2.13
goals-against average.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's nice. What else''?``''
</P>
<P>
   His position coach, Benoit Allaire, set a preseason goal for him
to finish statistically among the top five starting goalies in the
league.
</P>
<P>
   He did it. Right on the nose, thank you.
</P>
<P>
   ``Yeah, yeah. And what else has he done lately''?``''
</P>
<P>
   He's only 26, a virtual baby in the cut-throat world of
goaltending, where the stars don't hit their stride until reaching
30. But his 126 wins are the most in franchise history, his eight
shutouts this a year are a franchise record, and his 20 career
shutouts also are the organizational standard.
</P>
<P>
   So where are the ultimate accolades for Coyotes netminder
Nikolai Khabibulin?
</P>
<P>
   `` He still must prove himself''.``''
</P>
<P>
   ``He has played well and he's an important member of our team,''
said Bobby Smith, Coyotes' general manager. ``But as I said before
_ and he doesn't need any more pressure on him _ but to be
considered a successful goaltender, you have to be successful in
the playoffs.''
</P>
<P>
   Yes, it sounds cold. It also a hockey fact. Witness Khabibulin's
coach, Jim Schoenfeld: ``He is growing as a goaltender. The
greatest test _ and how we are all judged _ is based on our playoff
performance and we'll know that in a couple of weeks. He's a young
guy thrust into a No. 1 position very early who has handled it very
well. Now it's time for him to take it to the next step.''
</P>
<P>
   Khabibulin's performance, more than any other factor _ including
Jeremy Roenick's glass jaw _ is the key to the Coyotes winning
their best-of-seven, first-round playoff series against St. Louis,
and for the franchise to reach the second round for the first time
since 1987 and the second time in its NHL history.
</P>
<P>
   He knows it. And he's ready.
</P>
<P>
   ``I feel pretty confident,'' said the Russian, who posted a
32-23-7 record this season. ``I think I'm more confident because
after those three other losses in the first round, I just realize
that it is the same game pretty much.
</P>
<P>
   ``You try not to see anything different because you don't want
to put extra pressure on yourself. You try to think it's just
another game, try hard and play your best and see what happens.''
</P>
<P>
   The ``Bulin Wall' recalls his other playoff ousters vividly. He
started all six games three years ago when Detroit sent his team
packing. He started every game two years ago while introducing
Phoenix to the playoffs, as the Coyotes lost in seven games to
Anaheim.
</P>
<P>
   Last year tendinitis in a knee limited his playoff action to
three games and part of another, as Detroit dumped the Coyotes in
six games again. Yet, he did emerge with his first winning playoff
record at 2-1.
</P>
<P>
   ``We wanted Niki to concentrate on quality of performance
instead of quantity this year,'' Schoenfeld said. ``It has been a
game plan since training camp and one that we were able to follow
through with because of the fine play of Jimmy Waite early in the
season, and because of the play of Mikhail Shtalenkov since he
joined us.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's going in fresh and off a shutout (2-0 over Dallas
Saturday) which certainly won't hurt him. He knows that all season
long he was able to compete with the best goaltenders in the NHL
and on many occasions beat them. He feels good about his game and
he's looking forward to the playoffs. He has challenged himself,
which is good. When an athlete challenges himself he throws his
whole heart into reaching that goal.''
</P>
<P>
   The 63 games he appeared in during the year was his lightest
workload in the last three seasons. He played in 72 two years ago
and 70 last year, which included a streak of 60 consecutive games
over the two seasons. Management thought it played a significant
role in his knee problem and with his consistency.
</P>
<P>
   Since taking the helm for the final 26 games of the 1995 season
at 22, his goals against average has decreased each year, going
from 3.41, 3.13, 2.83 to 2.74 and, finally, this year's 2.13.
</P>
<P>
   ``My confidence has improved a lot since when I first came to
NHL,'' Khabibulin. ``I felt pretty confidence in myself before this
year, but especially this year. I was kind of thinking about the
type of season I've had and was thinking it wasn't bad, and this
year the (statistical) numbers are good, too.
</P>
<P>
   ``So I know the way I'm playing works and I can stick with it
regardless of whatever happens. But it's not just confidence, it's
also experience I've gained. Older players and older goalies have
been in the game more and because of it, they have a better chance
to win.''
</P>
<P>
   Khabibulin, whose mastery of English has grown three-fold this
year, said he now has something else to rely on, a factor that was
absent during his youthful start in the NHL. That is maturity,
which should serve him better in the playoffs.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am a little more mature than I was back then,'' he said, the
traces of a smile forming on his lips. ``I'm probably playing
better, too. Otherwise, why am I here for four years and not
playing any better?
</P>
<P>
   ``My techniques are better. My reading of the game is better.
I'm probably mentally tougher, too, in terms of preparation for a
game, during the game and then way I react when I allow a few goals
and have a bad start. It seems a little easier now than back
then.''
</P>
<P>
   Few have ever doubted his ability. It's his consistency that was
under a microscope entering the season, as Schoenfeld, alluded to
earlier. The lighter work load and more rest has helped to solve
the problem.
</P>
<P>
   ``He has been a more consistent goalie,'' Smith said. ``He has
always been capable of the great game, but I think he has given us
a chance to win when he hasn't been on his best game this year.
It's an important part of goaltending. You just can't win when
you're playing great.''
</P>
<P>
   That said, will it be a more secure Khabibulin that the Blues
will face?
</P>
<P>
   ``It depends what you mean by secure,'' Khabibulin said. ``Even
if I have a bad game I know I'm not a bad goalie. I can play good.
And, if not, I know I can come back, if not the next game, then a
game later I'm going to play good.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everybody has a bad stretch. Our team did. I did, too.
Everybody, even the great players, have bad games. The difference
is the more experienced and better players comeback quicker. As a
goalie, it's hard to stop some of the great players. I have to be
realistic. I'm not going to do it everytime.'' &QL;

TWO AFFLUENT TEEN MISFITS LIKED ADOLF HITLER BUT `WEREN'T EVIL' 
 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By TONY FREEMANTLE 
c.1999 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   LITTLETON, Colo. _ It could be that they were social misfits
bearing a grudge at having been insulted once too often by their
more popular peers. Or maybe they were two teen-agers from affluent
families who simply got caught up in a morbid, violent gang. It
could also be that they were racist neo-Nazis on a mission to
eradicate those they hated.
</P>
<P>
   Whatever twisted motives compelled Eric Harris, 18, and Dylan
Klebold, 17, to systematically gun down a teacher and 12 fellow
students at Columbine High School on Tuesday will probably go to
the grave with them.
</P>
<P>
   Even those who knew the two teen-agers well were at a loss to
explain why they did what they did. Why they apparently singled out
sports players and gunned them down. Why they singled out a black
student simply because of his race and killed him. Why they passed
over some terrified students and poured bullets into others.
</P>
<P>
   In the aftermath of Tuesday's tragedy, the worst massacre on a
school campus in U.S. history, students and parents gathered on
Wednesday at a park near the school, laid flowers at the foot of a
tree, hugged and cried, and tried to make sense of it all.
</P>
<P>
   What is known is that Harris and Klebold were members of a
small, loosely knit group of misfits who called themselves the
``Trenchcoat Mafia.'' They wore long black coats, black boots and
black clothes. They played violent computer games. They liked to
listen to the music of U.S. shock rocker Marilyn Manson. They liked
German heavy metal bands. And they thought Adolf Hitler was pretty
cool.
</P>
<P>
   But none of that, said Eric Veik, a 16-year-old friend who
attended a video class with Harris, explains why they snapped and
assaulted the school with semi-automatic weapons, shotguns and
home-made pipe bombs, killed 13 people and then themselves.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know what it was that caused them to do this,'' Veik
said, his eyes red from crying. ``Eric and Dylan are very bad for
what they did, but they had a sense of heart. They weren't evil
people.''
</P>
<P>
   Veik said he and Harris had recently collaborated on a video
project and that he had gone to Harris' home in an upper
middle-class Littleton neighborhood to see if it was a suitable
location for the project. He would not say what the subject of the
video was because he didn't want people ``to get the wrong
impression.''
</P>
<P>
   ``People are going to make so much of this group they hung out
with that everything will now be seen in those terms,'' he said.
``Consider this: If two people at the school were huge ecology
people and they went and did something like this, then everybody
would say that all environmentalists are crazy.''
</P>
<P>
   Veik said that at its height, the ``Trenchcoat Mafia'' group to
which Harris and Klebold belonged had about 15 members.
</P>
<P>
   But at least 10 of those had graduated from the school last
year. Harris and Klebold were pretty much the heart of those
members who were left, he said.
</P>
<P>
   On the street of single-family homes where Harris lived,
neighbors also were trying to find reasons Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Michael Good, whose son Matthew knew the two but who wasn't
particularly friendly with them, said his son had learned late
Wednesday that some of his friends were among the dead and that he
was going to need some time to work things out.
</P>
<P>
   ``Matt always thought there was something not right about
Eric,'' Michael Good said. ``We have three children and getting
them to school in the mornings can be quite tough so we suggested
to Matt that he get to know Eric so they could carpool to school.
But he thought Eric was a little strange and he made him uneasy.''
</P>
<P>
   The parents of both Harris and Klebold were in seclusion
Wednesday and would not talk to reporters. But they released
statements through their lawyers.
</P>
<P>
   The Klebolds' statement read: ``Our thoughts, prayers and
heartfelt apologies go out to the victims, their families, friends
and the entire community. Like the rest of the country, we are
struggling to understand why this happened and ask that you please
respect our privacy during this painful grieving period.''
</P>
<P>
   The Harrises said: ``We want to express our heartfelt sympathy
to the families of all the victims and to all the community for
this senseless tragedy. Please say prayers for everyone touched by
these terrible events.''
</P>
<P>
   By all accounts Harris and Klebold were close friends,
intelligent youths who treated their teachers with respect. One
student said Harris planned to go into the military.
</P>
<P>
   Harris' father is a retired Air Force pilot, and Harris lived at
the Air Force base in Plattsburgh, N.Y., from 1993 to 1996, moving
to Littleton after that.
</P>
<P>
   Those who knew them said Harris was the more strident of the
two, more brazenly displaying his Nazi symbols. He was a fan of the
German techno band Rammstein and would spend hours playing violent
on-line combat games.
</P>
<P>
   Harris apparently established a Web site that included detailed
directions for making pipe bombs and contained disturbing images of
guns, bombs and a conquering figure standing over a pile of skulls.
</P>
<P>
   Klebold, they said, was more of a follower.
</P>
<P>
   Klebold drove a beat-up BMW with a sticker for the hard-rock
band Nine-Inch Nails. He liked sports, and was a big fan of the
Boston Red Sox, said Andrew Beard, a fellow student. But he hated
``jocks'' in school who teased him.
</P>
<P>
   ``Dylan said he hated the jocks, and how they could walk over
people and thought they were tough,'' Beard said.
</P>
<P>
   John House, 17, a senior, said he refused to associate with
Klebold after he joined the ``Trenchcoat Mafia.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I went bowling with him, and when he would do something good,
he would shout, `Heil Hitler!' and throw up his hand,'' House said.
``It just made everyone mad.''
</P>
<P>
   Jefferson County officials said that in January last year Harris
and Klebold got into trouble when they broke into a car.
</P>
<P>
   They were charged with auto criminal trespass with intent to
commit theft and were placed in a juvenile probation program.
</P>
<P>
   But despite this brief brush with the law there were no obvious
signs that these were two boys headed for major trouble.
</P>
<P>
   Some students said they were a tragedy waiting to happen. But
just as many said they were part of a bunch of ``dweebs'' who stuck
to themselves, forming groups of like minds so they could fit in
somewhere.
</P>
<P>
   But that still doesn't explain why Harris and Klebold set about
amassing an arsenal of bombs and weapons and went berserk.
</P>
<P>
   ``Several things I've heard could point to a reason,'' said
Michael Good, ``but in the end, none of it makes any sense.''

`NO MORE EXCUSES'  
 COYOTES MOLDED FOR RUN AT CUP 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By BOB MCMANAMAN  
 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHOENIX - When the decision was made during the Winnipeg Jets'
final season in Canada to cut the payroll and trade away
high-flying scorer Teemu Selanne, the franchise that soon would
become the Phoenix Coyotes took on the form of a shapeless heap of
clay.
</P>
<P>
   New owners brought it to life by bringing it to a Valley oasis.
They put a face on it by changing the name, the colors, the logo.
Management gave it charisma by trading for the colorful Jeremy
Roenick, then gave it strong legs to stand on by signing war horse
Rick Tocchet as a free agent.
</P>
<P>
   Slowly, the sculpture took shape. Another trade brought U.S.
Olympic defenseman Keith Carney. It grew in a huge way last summer
by luring defenseman Jyrki Lumme away from Vancouver and grew again
with the addition of left wing Greg Adams from Dallas.
</P>
<P>
   And once the Coyotes re-signed their heart and soul, rugged
captain Keith Tkachuk, to a three-year deal, the project was almost
complete. A little more shaping and one more powerful stroke, and
owner Richard Burke and General Manager Bobby Smith could pull the
curtains and unveil a team they felt could challenge for the
Stanley Cup.
</P>
<P>
   Thanks to Burke, who split business ties with partner Steven
Gluckstern, Smith made it happen. He scoured the league for added
depth and insurance, where a platoon of veteran role players now
sit and await his call. He solidified the backup goalie position by
trading for the experienced Mikhail Shtalenkov. He injected more
help on the blue line by acquiring J.J. Daigneault, then Jamie
Huscroft and then Stan Neckar.
</P>
<P>
   But the move many felt put them over the top was the trade that
sent Brad Isbister to the New York Islanders at the trading
deadline for high-scoring center Robert Reichel, the No. 2 man they
needed behind a rejuvenated, rededicated and reborn Roenick.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was just talking with Shoney (Coach Jim Schoenfeld) about
that,'' Tkachuk said, ``about how we finally get into position
where we build a strong team here, we go out and have a real good
year, we get fourth place and home-ice advantage. We get all these
great free agents, Lumme, this and that, Tocchet, trading for
Roenick.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everything was building and it can take years to do that and
then . . .''
</P>
<P>
   And then one disturbing and violent hit from the Dallas Stars'
Derian Hatcher turned a statue of hope into a one-armed Venus de
Milo. When the Coyotes lost Roenick to Hatcher's jaw-breaking
check, it was like losing their right arm.
</P>
<P>
   So the Coyotes won't have their leading scorer for the playoffs
after a season in which they finished 39-31-12 and ended up with
the most points (90) in their 20-year NHL history. It was a
crushing blow, but it must be dealt with as they prepare for their
best-of-seven, first-round series against the St. Louis Blues,
which begins tonight with the first of two games at America West
Arena.
</P>
<P>
   ``It hurts. It does hurt,'' said Tkachuk, who led the club with
36 goals and had 68 points, four fewer than Roenick. ``But it
doesn't mean we can't get past this first round and more. But it is
a little frustrating when you build for the past couple years to
get where you want to be and a guy like Derian Hatcher goes out and
does something like that.''
</P>
<P>
   Hatcher, the Stars' 6-foot-5 captain, was suspended for seven
games. Will the Coyotes live to play at least that many games or
beyond in the postseason?
</P>
<P>
   Certain things have to happen. Much of it starts with Tkachuk, a
three-time All-Star and one of the league's best and strongest
power forwards. Tkachuk drew criticism during the team's playoff
series loss to Detroit for what many viewed as a substandard
effort. He didn't like it.
</P>
<P>
   But now it's Tkachuk who's issuing the challenges.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are no more excuses,'' he said. ``I don't care if we've
got 10 guys out of the lineup. We have to find a way to win. We
feel we can win the first round, plus more. We must win. That's
what it is. And this is where it starts.''
</P>
<P>
   Tkachuk will attempt to replace Roenick himself, moving from
left wing to center on the club's No. 1 line. Right wing Dallas
Drake moves to the left side and Schoenfeld, at least to start,
will try Shane Doan on the right.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't know if Shane's going to keep up this pace. That's a
question mark for us. But maybe this is his time,'' Schoenfeld
said.
</P>
<P>
   If it is, it will allow the Coyotes to keep their second line of
Adams, Reichel and Tocchet together, which would be a major plus.
Just as important would be having someone else step up and take
center stage with a breakthrough postseason.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a different season. It's amazing,'' Tocchet said. ``The
playoffs are a time when you can make your mark somehow. It can be
a guy who had an average season or didn't do well and all of a
sudden, the guy might come up out of nowhere. There's always
stories like that in the playoffs. If we have one, hopefully he can
shine, whoever he is.''
</P>
<P>
   Maybe it'll be Doan, the strapping 22-year-old who just finished
his fourth NHL season. He had six goals and 16 assists, numbers
that would look great after a couple playoff rounds.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe it'll be defenseman Oleg Tverdovsky, who turns 23 next
month and yet already is a veteran of five NHL seasons. He's made
huge strides this season in his own zone, but still can't seem to
please everyone. It's been a rocky year in many ways. If anyone
deserves to steal the show in the playoffs, maybe it's him.
</P>
<P>
   But it probably will do the Coyotes better if the person who
rises above everyone else is goalie Nikolai Khabibulin, who set
career highs with 32 wins and eight shutouts and appeared in his
second straight All-Star Game. If he can outshine Grant Fuhr, who
enters the playoffs on an incredible hot streak, the Coyotes have a
realistic shot to advance.
</P>
<P>
   Even without JR.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've got to play smarter, though,'' Khabibulin said. ``I
think we play hard, but sometimes we don't really think when we're
on the ice. It seems like we play all right and then all of a
sudden, there's a bad play or a bad mistake in our end and it gets
us down. We have to eliminate those and just play smart.''
</P>
<P>
   Like they did at the start of the season, when they rattled off
a 14-game unbeaten streak and went 17 games allowing two goals or
fewer, the third longest streak in the NHL's modern era. But just
getting past the first round won't satisfy this bunch, Tocchet
said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't have the attitude that if we win in the first round,
we've done our job,'' he said. ``We want to go far. This team was
assembled to do something special. . . . There's always a team in
the NHL that's a Cinderella story and goes somewhere. When all the
cogs are right and everybody steps up, you never know what can
happen.'' &QL;

`LITTLE HEIDI` GROWS UP
 &HT;     ELITE GYMNAST VAULTS BACK FROM SURGERY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By JEFF METCALFE  
 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SALT LAKE CITY _ In one breath, Heidi Hornbeek downplays her
return to the NCAA Gymnastics Championships.
</P>
<P>
   But the 22-year-old knows better. She has as many academic as
athletic honors and has earned a degree from Arizona in
physiological sciences. To be here competing today _ and, if she is
successful, Saturday for a second event title - is a triumph of
medicine and will.
</P>
<P>
   Ten months ago, when Hornbeek started back from experimental
shoulder surgery, she collapsed on her head attempting a simple
handstand mastered at age 7. ``All her strength was gone,'' UA
Coach Bill Ryden said. ``The most basic movement became a chore.''
</P>
<P>
   Now, Ryden said, the Glendale redshirt senior has 90 percent of
her abilities back. She is the top-seeded all-around performer who
is not from a team qualifier and is in a rotation with
second-seeded UCLA this afternoon at the Huntsman Center.
</P>
<P>
   The first session also includes Arizona State, bidding for a
third consecutive Super Six team final appearance; and Stanford,
with Katy Herbert of Chandler.
</P>
<P>
   The evening session includes host Utah, with Angie Leonard of
Tempe; Nebraska, with Amy Ringo of Phoenix; and Laura Moon of
Scottsdale, competing at-large for Maryland.
</P>
<P>
   ``Heidi will be going up every event after their (UCLA's) best
girl,'' Ryden said. ``There could be worse situations to be in.''
</P>
<P>
   Hornbeek went through the worst long ago.
</P>
<P>
   When Jon Wang, UA orthopedic surgeon, presented her case to a
group of his peers, he was told to forget it. The idea of drilling
a hole in her hip and fusing that bone into the shoulder to replace
cartilage, then reattaching ligaments was speculative enough for
someone moderately active. But for an elite college gymnast, it was
considered folly.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had to decide,'' Hornbeek said. ``I could have taken a
medical (redshirt), still kept my scholarship and be in med school
now. But I'm very glad I went through it. I've grown so much. My
freshman year, I don't think I enjoyed the sport, but it paid for
school. Now I've learned to love the sport in a way I never thought
I would.''
</P>
<P>
   Tapping into the joy of gymnastics always has been a challenge
for the perfectionist Hornbeek, whose abilities have drawn
attention for more than a decade.
</P>
<P>
   ``I get too serious, then I start not having fun,'' she said in
1991.
</P>
<P>
   Trained under Dan Witenstein at the Arizona Sunrays, Hornbeek
was the first alternate to the 1992 U.S. Olympic Trials. Continuing
as an international gymnast until '96 was not an option because of
a deteriorating back, so Hornbeek opted for college, becoming UA's
second national champion with a perfect 10.0 score on floor
exercise in 1996.
</P>
<P>
   But by the fall of 1998, she could not lift her arm above her
shoulder because of inflamed cartilage. And so the surgery.
</P>
<P>
   ``It took her two seconds to decide,'' Ryden said. ``Quitting is
not in her nature.''
</P>
<P>
   What followed was six months with her arm immobilized, then
intense rehabilitation to regain range of motion. All that came
before her handstand flop on Day 1 in the gym in June.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was pretty ready to throw in the towel,'' she said. ``I felt
like I was completely starting over. For a month or two, I thought,
`This stinks, maybe I'll just do one event.' Then I started doing
giants on bars, and I thought, `I can do it.' ''
</P>
<P>
   Ryden said progress was minimal during the second half of 1998.
When competition began in January, Hornbeek was nowhere near her
former self. Still, she put up a decent 38.125 all-around score in
the season opener and pushed that total in her last two meets to
39.375.
</P>
<P>
   Hornbeek is ranked 17th nationally in the vault. At the Region 3
Championships, she tied for second all-around and shared the
balance beam title. The high marks came despite watered-down
routines on all but vault to accommodate the shoulder.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm very comfortable with what I'm throwing, but they're not
the tricks I want to be doing,'' Hornbeek said. ``My focus next
year will be to do the biggest tricks I can.''
</P>
<P>
   With a season remaining because of missing 1998 as a redshirt,
Hornbeek will finish her career as Nikki Beyschau of Sunrays begins
hers. Also from Glendale, Beyschau grew up in the considerable
shadow of Hornbeek, 4 feet 6 at age 14 and now all of 5-3.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a different Heidi,'' said Ryden, who calls Hornbeek buff
because of her weight training even though she balks at the
description. ``She's much more mature. She doesn't look like this
little pixie. She's very cut and incredibly strong.''
</P>
<P>
   And doing a floor routine to Metallica, about as far as possible
from the`` Grease'' routine that won nationals.
</P>
<P>
   Hornbeek said, ``I've always had cute music and been little
Heidi, and that really wasn't me.'' &QL;

PUTTING ON A GAME FACE 
 PITCHERS' RITUALS RANGE FROM WARRIOR TO WEIRD 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By RICHARD OBERT  
 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHOENIX - Todd Stottlemyre crawls into a mental foxhole and
prepares for warfare.
</P>
<P>
   It is his pitching day, and that means don't bother trying to
talk to the Diamondbacks' right-hander. Even if you're Mrs.
Stottlemyre.
</P>
<P>
   ``My poor family,'' Stottlemyre said a day before a recent
start. ``I'm really a little on the irritable side. I don't like
talking too much. It's a stay-away day.''
</P>
<P>
   He'll maybe utter a ``Hey'' to a fellow pitcher and go over
strategy with his catcher. But, other than than, forget it.
Stottlemyre is locked in. Ready to fire, visualizing in his head
the pitches he's going to make that day.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you pitch once every fifth day, it's your day to
perform,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   A bad day is a bad week for a starting pitcher.
</P>
<P>
   That's why, when that fifth day rolls around, the clubhouse
creed before games among media members and, in many instances,
teammates, is keep a distance, give him his space, spare yourself.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's understandable for any pitcher to be unapproachable,''
said Valley resident Andy Hassler, who pitched in the big leagues
as both a starter and reliever from 1969 to '85. ``If you go to a
lawyer who is getting ready to plead his case to the Supreme Court,
the last thing you want to do is talk to him. He'd probably chew
your head off.''
</P>
<P>
   Philadelphia Phillies Manager Terry Francona can pretty much
tell hours before a game whether his ace, former Shadow Mountain
High pitcher Curt Schilling, is going to go out and dominate
hitters.
</P>
<P>
   ``If he's on edge, I feel better about him pitching,'' Francona
said.
</P>
<P>
   Part of Diamondbacks starter Andy Benes' pre-game ritual is
opening mail. He'll do that for about 45 minutes before each of his
starts.
</P>
<P>
   ``That tends to relax me,'' he said. ``It alleviates any tension
I might have.''
</P>
<P>
   Although he's not soliciting interviews, Benes doesn't become
Mr. Hyde on the day he pitches. His demeanor is the same at home,
no matter which day it is, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I'm out there, my 3-, 4-, and 5-year-olds don't know what
this is all about,'' he said. ``They just see me as Dad.''
</P>
<P>
   There are workouts in the weight room, cardio workouts, sprints,
off-day pitching from the mound, research, studying hitters,
studying film of themselves. They'll eat certain foods on their
pitching days. Some stick with proteins: hamburgers and steaks.
Others prefer pasta. Some may sleep in the training room. Some may
listen to Mozart.
</P>
<P>
   No pitcher is the same. Each has his own method, mad or not, to
enhance his performance when the ball is handed to him.
</P>
<P>
   Some don't give away anything.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not telling,'' Los Angeles Dodgers pitcher Kevin Brown
said about how he prepares. ``It's my secret.''
</P>
<P>
   Former Dodgers pitcher Charlie Hough, now the club's pitching
coach, sees a dramatic change in how pitchers prepare between
starts since the days he floated knuckleballs to the plate for
batters to guess at in the '70s and '80s.
</P>
<P>
   Work, work and more work.
</P>
<P>
   ``Kevin's a workaholic,'' Hough said. ``These guys see how good
the hitters are getting, so they're going to find ways to have an
edge.''
</P>
<P>
   What was Hough's secret when he pitched?
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't have one,'' he said. ``I didn't think about it. I
just kind of went out there and pitched.''
</P>
<P>
   Last year, when left-hander Brian Anderson was a starter, he
said he didn't have any superstitions on the days he pitched,
although he said he would stand and stare at the clock.
</P>
<P>
   Once the minute hand clicked to :42 for a 7:05 or 1:05 game,
that was Anderson's time to take the ball and start warming up.
</P>
<P>
   ``Right at that number,'' Anderson said. ``That should give me
enough time. That's it. Other than that, I'm pretty easy.''
</P>
<P>
   Manager Buck Showalter has been around long enough to know that
pitchers march to a different drummer, that some can be wackier
than others, and that you don't question something that works.
</P>
<P>
   In 1995, while managing the New York Yankees, the first day of
spring training, Showalter heard the brrrrr of roller blades racing
down the corridor outside his office. He opened the door and there
went his ace closer, John Wetteland, looking like Wayne Gretzky.
</P>
<P>
   Wetteland, recently acquired from the Montreal Expos, had made
the Fort Lauderdale, Fla., training facility parking lot his own
personal playground. How was Showalter going to explain that to the
boss?
</P>
<P>
   ``I kind of thought, `What are we going to do?''' Showalter
said. ``I figured I was going to hear from George (owner George
Steinbrenner) about it.''
</P>
<P>
   It was part of Wetteland's pre-game conditioning, and Showalter
learned to deal with it, just like the facial hair that Randy
Johnson brought to the Diamondbacks this season.
</P>
<P>
   ``The bottom line is, whatever makes them a better pitcher,''
Showalter said.
</P>
<P>
   Some are quirkier than others.
</P>
<P>
   Dodgers coach Rick Dempsey, who spent 24 years as a major league
catcher, has worked with so many pitchers with superstitions he
can't begin to count them. But, in '88, when he was at the tail end
of his career catching for the Dodgers, he saw a pitcher, Brian
Holton, with one of the strangest routines.
</P>
<P>
   ``It wasn't so much pre-game as it was warming up,'' Dempsey
said. ``You couldn't hand him the ball. You had to drop the ball in
front of the mound. He'd pick the ball up, walk around to the back
of the mound. He'd take five swipes on the rubber with his left
foot, five swipes with his right. He'd walk around the mound and
address the ball in a proper manner, then he'd be ready to start
the game.
</P>
<P>
   ``This guy was amazing with how you had to sit in the same spot
on the bench. He'd lay his glove down at the same angle. Everything
was a routine.''
</P>
<P>
   Chicago Cubs television analyst Steve Stone not only ate at the
same pancake house when he was pitching for the Baltimore Orioles,
but insisted on eating with the same newspaper reporter every time.
It worked for him. In 1980, he won 25 games and the Cy Young Award.
</P>
<P>
   Nobody on the Diamondbacks is that superstitious.
</P>
<P>
   Reliever Darren Holmes, who once started in his career, finds
nirvana by strumming Nirvana songs and others on his electric
guitar before games.
</P>
<P>
   Relievers are different, because they need to be mentally sharp
every day, not knowing when they're going to be called out of the
bullpen.
</P>
<P>
   ``Two days before a start, you get a little uptight, anxious to
get out there,'' said Anderson, who is naturally hyper. ``As a
reliever, you can't afford to be anxious every day, so you're a
little more loose.''
</P>
<P>
   Music is a good way of relaxing and getting charged up.
</P>
<P>
   Ask Scottsdale-resident Ron Davis, who pitched from 1976 to '90
with the Yankees, Minnesota Twins, San Francisco Giants, Chicago
Cubs and in Japan.
</P>
<P>
   Every time he came in from the pen with the Twins, he was
serenaded with the song, ``Eye of the Tiger,'' which played over
the public-address.
</P>
<P>
   ``That meant, get out there and get aggressive, get mean, get
ugly, whatever it takes to get them out,'' Davis said. ``Get out
with an attitude, an attitude of meanness.''
</P>
<P>
   Guys like Johnson and Stottlemyre bring that attitude to the
Diamondbacks' staff.
</P>
<P>
   ``I almost put myself into a war-like state,'' Stottlemyre said.
``I found that is where I get the most out of myself.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is nothing like game day. Nothing substitutes for one
hour before you're going to pitch, the feeling you've got in your
gut. To me, there is no other feeling like it.''
</P>
<P>
   Just don't get in his way. &QL;

PITCHER MAKING RIGHT MOVES IN TUCSON 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By RICHARD OBERT  
 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   The Diamondbacks bullpen showed signs of stabilizing during this
homestand, but pitcher  &UR; Nelson Figueroa is showing early signs in
Tucson that he's ready to make the jump if needed.
</P>
<P>
   Last weekend, he started and yielded one hit in seven innings.
In his first start, he pitched five innings and gave up only one
hit, a home run for his only earned run in 12 innings.
</P>
<P>
   A starter for the Triple-A Sidewinders, Figueroa, who was born
in Brooklyn and turns 25 on May 14, said he sees himself as a
middle reliever should he get the call.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'd like to be able to get the opportunity to be up and show
what I can do,'' he said. ``I can't worry about what's happening up
there. I don't look at who I can replace up there. I'd go crazy, if
I did.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'd rather just do what I can down here and keep getting
better.''
</P>
<P>
   Figueroa, who said all five pitches are working well, has struck
out 14 and walked five.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's a gamer,'' said  &UR; Bobby Dickerson, the organization's
minor-league field coordinator. ``He's done all that we can ask of
him to start the season.
</P>
<P>
   ``I believe he's a potential guy who can come up here. It's just
a matter of getting more innings, more consistency.'' &QL; 
Feeling at home &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Korean pitcher  &UR; Byung-Hyun Kim was having more trouble adjusting
to American life than hitters, until a family that owns a Korean
restaurant in El Paso recently took him in. That's helped diminish
some of the 20-year-old's homesickness, Dickerson said.
</P>
<P>
   An interpreter is staying with Kim, who had not given up a run
in three appearances for the Double-A team before Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's got above-average, major-league stuff, but it's very
tough on him leaving his country,'' Dickerson said.  &QL; 
Snake bites &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Pitcher  &UR; Amaury Telemaco, on a rehabilitation assignment at
Triple-A Tucson, has shown improvement with his velocity but has
struggled getting out hitters.
</P>
<P>
   In 5 innings, Telemaco has hit three batters, yielded seven hits
and has a 7.94 ERA. He must be activated by May 7 or put on
waivers.
</P>
<P>
   Three minor-league pitchers will be coming to Phoenix soon to
have their arms checked for soreness. They are right-hander  &UR; Brad
Penny (Double-A El Paso) and left-hander  &UR; Brian
 &UR; Shouse (Triple-A Tucson) for shoulders, and left-hander  &UR; Troy
Brohawn (Tucson) for an elbow.
</P>
<P>
   Penny, who was the California League Most Valuable Player last
year at Class A High Desert, has allowed 10 earned runs in 13
innings, walked six and lost two decisions. &QL;

PITCHERS BYTE ON TECHNOLOGY  
 COMPUTERS GROW POPULAR AS AID 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By RICHARD OBERT  
 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHOENIX - It's more than two hours before game time, and
Philadelphia Phillies pitcher Curt Schilling sits at his locker
stall, a laptop computer at his fingertips, clicking onto his video
library.
</P>
<P>
   He watches himself pitch against select Diamondbacks from last
season. He checks the pitches that Tony Batista drove for a double
and Matt Williams lined into left field, and figures how to pitch
them differently for his next start.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'll watch film the four days between my starts,'' said
Schilling, a Shadow Mountain High graduate who has hooked in with
the latest technology in search of an edge. ``It's very helpful.''
</P>
<P>
   Across Bank One Ballpark, inside the home team's clubhouse,
relievers Gregg Olson and Darren Holmes input information into
their computer programs that they say keep themselves on top of the
game's most dangerous hitters.
</P>
<P>
   Every day, before the Diamondbacks take the field, Olson calls
up the file on every hitter he might face.
</P>
<P>
   His post-game ritual includes logging in every pitch he made. He
brings his computer on the road. He uses it on the airplane, in his
hotel room, in the clubhouse.
</P>
<P>
   Olson keeps the pitch sequence, the location, how hard the ball
was hit, if it was hit.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've always kept notes,'' he said. ``I try to give myself an
idea of what I'm going to throw the batter. I'll try to pick up
what hitters do and how to pitch to them.''
</P>
<P>
   Holmes, who was acquired from the New York Yankees in a trade
during the spring, said he always charted everything on paper.
Olson, he said, helped him put it on a computer. But Holmes
emphasizes the hitters and their tendencies, not so much his
pitches.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'll put down the situation I faced the hitter in, what the
count was, what was the score, the inning,'' Holmes said. ``I'll
see what the hitters did, if nobody was on base, if they were
patient. I'll see if they were swinging at a breaking ball in the
dirt. That's big.''
</P>
<P>
   Holmes said he got into charting everything with paper and pen
from former Colorado Rockies teammate Dante Bichette. They played
on the same teams together between 1991 and '97. Holmes recalls how
Bichette had a chart of every pitcher he's ever had to face in the
major leagues.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's why he's such a great hitter,'' Holmes said. ``(San
Diego Padres outfielder) Tony Gwynn does the same thing. Great
hitters do that.''
</P>
<P>
   It's a constant chess match. And the catchers play a big role.
</P>
<P>
   Catcher Kelly Stinnett said he'll go over lineups with the
pitchers every day.
</P>
<P>
   ``How guys swing the bat, who's hot, who's not, what kind of
success we've had against them,'' Stinnett said.
</P>
<P>
   Much of the physical work for starters are the days between
their turns in the rotation. There is weight lifting and running.
Pitching coach Mark Connor said the second day after a start is
usually a throw day off the mound to get the feel for it and work
on mechanics and location and to keep their arm strength up.
</P>
<P>
   Randy Johnson is an exception, Connor said. Johnson throws on
the third day.
</P>
<P>
   ``He just feels it has a better feel going into his next
start,'' Connor said.
</P>
<P>
   The starter usually takes it easy on the fourth day. Connor
said, for some pitchers, he has to constantly reassure their
confidence. For others, there's no need to soothe egos. For a few,
you leave them alone to their laptop.
</P>
<P>
   ``When it comes down to it, the day you pitch might be the
easiest of them all, not pressure-wise, but physically,'' said
left-hander Brian Anderson, who made the transition from starter to
reliever in the spring. ``Those other four days are really used to
beat yourself up, keep yourself strong and in shape.''
</P>
<P>
   And when things are going good, that next start feels like
tomorrow.
</P>
<P>
   ``But when things are going bad, it feels like 10 days between
starts,'' Anderson said. &QL;

SALVAGE SEASON BY TRADING INJURED STARS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By JEFF CADE  
 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Oh, ye who shed crocodile tears, know ye no shame?
</P>
<P>
   Calls of condolences, NONE of them sincere and most probably
coming from Dodgers fans, poured out this week to fantasy owners of
 &UR; Barry
 &UR; Bonds and  &UR; Jim Edmonds. Bonds is out at least 2{ months and Edmonds
is out four months after both underwent surgery _ removing all hope
for many fantasy league owners.
</P>
<P>
   No one wishes harm to a player, but in a league of 12 owners,
it's a safe guess that 11 aren't too upset when a star gets hurt.
That old comforting line applies, ``Better you than me.''
</P>
<P>
   A loss of Edmonds is painful enough. He hits 25 to 30 homers,
drives in 95 runs, bats .300 and makes highlight-film catches each
night.
</P>
<P>
   The loss of Bonds, even in an all-star league, is devastating.
There is no hope of recovery. Bonds is one of the best.
</P>
<P>
   The only way to salvage the season is to maybe trade those
players for two or three players of lower stock but who at least
will play every day _ and that only works in a keeper league. It's
hard to part with such superstars, but there are more than a few
ambulance chasing bottom feeders who will happily take them. &QL; 
Closers aren't safe &QL; 
Closers. Who knows what's going on with them?
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Jeff Montgomery's days as Royals closer could be over.
</P>
<P>
   He upset Manager  &UR; Tony Muser last weekend when he pitched around
White Sox slugger  &UR; Frank Thomas with two on, two outs and a two-run
lead. The next batter singled home two runs, the Royals eventually
lost and Montgomery blew what is known in the biz as a room-service
save.
</P>
<P>
   When asked, Muser reportedly said the Royals weren't pitching
around Thomas _ that with two outs and a two-run lead, you have to
get Thomas out. Of course, ``Monty'' said he'd pitched around
Thomas in that situation no matter what anyone says.
</P>
<P>
   Tuesday night, Montgomery pitched three innings in a non-save
situation. That's a lot more than a closer throws.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe it's just a tiff, but if you have Montgomery, it might be
time to make a deal.
</P>
<P>
   Boston's  &UR; Tom Gordon is out for two weeks because of an injury.
 &UR; Derek Lowe picked up a save in his place Tuesday night. Does that
mean he'll get the next chance?
</P>
<P>
   Toronto's  &UR; Robert Person handed a save opportunity to  &UR; Graeme
Lloyd over the weekend. So his spot could be shaky.
</P>
<P>
   Philadelphia's  &UR; Jeff Brantley has had swelling in his shoulder.
He tried to pitch through that last year and wrecked his season.
</P>
<P>
   And the Cubs have to wonder if ``the Shooter,''  &UR; Rod Beck, has
spent all of his bullets. &QL; 
Out of the gate &QL; 
 &UR; Kevin Stocker will not lead the American League in hitting and
 &UR; Rich
 &UR; Aurilia will not win the National League Triple Crown, but you
might get somebody else to believe they will.
</P>
<P>
   Once these laddies start getting more at-bats, their numbers
will return to normal. That goes for pitchers, too. But lots of
owners don't look beyond the present, especially when things are
going bad. They see  &UR; Chuck Finley's 7.94 ERA and fear he is washed
up.
</P>
<P>
   But those who exchange Finley or maybe  &UR; Rick Helling for  &UR; Bobby
Witt are wasting their money.
</P>
<P>
   But then again, those with  &UR; Ron Gant have reason to wonder. He
has three hits and 14 strikeouts in 39 at-bats. If he ever turns it
on, it'll be incredible, but that's a big if. &QL; 
Too good for Rivera &QL; 
This sounds nutty, but don't be surprised if  &UR; Mariano Rivera ranks
near the bottom for saves.
</P>
<P>
   Why? Because the Yankees are too good for their closer. When
they win, they win big. Rivera may have fewer save opportunities
than normal. The Yankees have eight wins and Rivera has one save.
At that rate, he'd finish with 16, a stunning number for an owner
counting on getting three times that many. &QL; 
Gotta love 'em &QL; 
How about those D-Backs?
</P>
<P>
   All projected as bargains, although perhaps not in real life,
 &UR; Jay
 &UR; Bell, Luis Gonzalez, Bernard Gilkey, Matt Williams and &UR; Tony Batista
have created value for themselves.
</P>
<P>
   Fantasy owners are watching the D-Backs much more closely, which
wasn't the case a year ago. &QL; 
Ouch! &QL; 
Everybody and their dog has been out chasing the ambulance.
</P>
<P>
   Besides Bonds, Edmonds, Gordon,  &UR; Will Clark, Rick Reed,
Francisco
 &UR; Cordova, Mark Gardner, Joey Hamilton, Scott Hatteberg, Dave Hollins
and even  &UR; Cal Ripken went down in the past week. Good luck in your
scramble to replace them.
</P>
<P>
   The good news is that you are not alone. Practically everybody
has somebody who is hurt. Most of the injuries cancel out. What
doesn't cancel out is who you replace them with.
</P>
<P>
   Like I said, good luck. &QL;

AMERICA ONLINE TO COMPETE IN ASSIGNING INTERNET DOMAINS 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Pa.) (js) 
 By JERI CLAUSING   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ America Online, the world's largest online service,
was one of five companies chosen Wednesday to compete with Network
Solutions Inc., which currently enjoys a government-backed monopoly
in the lucrative business of assigning the Internet addresses known
as domains.
</P>
<P>
   The surprising choice of America Online introduced a seemingly
formidable competitor to the business of assigning Internet
addresses _ and prompted questions about whether smaller companies
would ever compete effectively.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's unfortunate,'' said David J. Farber, a professor of
computer science at the University of Pennsylvania and a board
member of the Electronic Frontier Foundation, an Internet civil
liberties group. ``I think it was a good opportunity to spread the
wealth. Now you get AOL against NSI, and they can have a ball.''
</P>
<P>
   The other four companies selected in this first round _ the
competition will open to many more companies this summer _ were
Register.com, a comparatively small, New York-based domain name
reseller; a subsidiary of France Telecom; Melbourne IT of
Australia, and the Internet Council of Registrars, an international
consortium that helped lead the movement to break Network
Solutions' monopoly.
</P>
<P>
   The selections were the first major action taken by Internet
Corp. for Assigned Names and Numbers, or Icann, the nonprofit
corporation established last year by the Clinton administration to
move management of the Internet from government to the private
sector.
</P>
<P>
   Since 1993, Network Solutions has had an exclusive right to
assign companies and individuals Internet addresses in the
so-called top-level domains _ those ending in the suffixes .com,
.net and .org.
</P>
<P>
   Icann's interim chairman, Esther Dyson, on Wednesday
characterized the move as ``a major milestone'' in bringing
``Internet users the benefits of real competition.''
</P>
<P>
   But just how much competition the companies will offer Network
Solutions remains to be seen, since the companies must pay Network
Solutions a $9-a-year fee for each name they add to the central
registry, the data base of Internet addresses that Network
Solutions will continue to own.
</P>
<P>
   They will also have to pay a $10,000 fee to help cover the costs
of the software developed by Network Solutions to let others add
addresses to the registry.
</P>
<P>
   In the seven years since it was granted an exclusive government
contract to build the data base and registry system, Network
Solutions has transformed itself into a Fortune 500 company,
offering a variety of registration services and establishing
partnerships around the world.
</P>
<P>
   The stock of Network Solutions, which had lost half its value
over the last few weeks, surged Wednesday, closing at $92, up $32,
or 53 percent, from Tuesday. America Online climbed to $142.75, up
$14.0625.
</P>
<P>
   ``The economic reality is that Network Solutions has all the
market movement in its favor,'' said Keith Benjamin, an Internet
analyst with BancBoston Robertson Stephens in San Francisco, ``and
there's nothing Icann or the government can do to really unseat
Network Solutions.''
</P>
<P>
   He added, ``They have a crucial relationship with essentially
every Internet service provider on the planet.''
</P>
<P>
   As for America Online, which has 17 million members, Benjamin
said: ``This is a business that AOL is not going to be easily
suited for. They cater to a consumer market, so it is a little
confusing why AOL is doing this.''
</P>
<P>
   In addition to selecting the five initial companies, Icann
announced that 29 applicants, including AT&AMP;T, had met its
accreditation criteria and were expected to be certified to compete
when the system is opened to unlimited competition this summer.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   A spokesman for Network Solutions, Christopher Clough, called
competition ``good for everyone,'' but added: ``Obviously, we have
a head start. We have the most established company. We have the
world's leading experts on the domain-name system,''
</P>
<P>
   Referring to the fees that competitors will pay for access to
the registry, he noted that Network Solutions was not only ``taking
on five new competitors but five new customers.''
</P>
<P>
   Bill Burrington, vice president for policy at America Online,
said his company saw an opportunity to create a ``value-added
service.'' But he emphasized that ``it's too early to say how the
process will play out.''
</P>
<P>
   ``This is all new,'' he said. ``We are doing this on the fly _
in Internet time,'' Burrington said. ``We don't know where this is
all going.''

SCHOOLS GET CHOICES ON SPENDING U.S. AID 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Miss., Minn., Md., Texas, Ohio, Del., N.Y.)  (mk) 
 By JAMES DAO   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Congress overwhelmingly approved legislation
Wednesday that gives states and local schools more flexibility in
how they spend more than $10 billion in federal education money
each year. President Clinton immediately said he would sign the
bill.
</P>
<P>
   Known as the Education Flexibility Partnership Act, or Ed-flex,
the legislation passed 368-57 in the House and 98-1 in the Senate,
with only Democrats voting against it.
</P>
<P>
   Both parties are trying to show their support for education, and
the Republicans in particular are concerned about demonstrating
that they are more than the party of impeachment. And in many ways
the legislation was the fruit of Republican efforts to scale back
the federal government's role in education.
</P>
<P>
   ``The bipartisan work on this legislation shows we can and must
work together to improve our nation's schools,'' Clinton said in a
statement. He then called on Congress to enact his proposals to
hire more teachers and rebuild schools.
</P>
<P>
   The final bill did not include a measure proposed by Senate
Majority Leader Trent Lott, R-Miss., that would have allowed
schools to divert money for hiring teachers to programs for
disabled students. Clinton had threatened to veto the measure if
Lott's provision was included.
</P>
<P>
   The bill had broad support among educators, including the
organization representing state education commissioners and the
nation's largest teachers' union, the National Education
Association. All 50 governors also endorsed it.
</P>
<P>
   Critics have asserted that the legislation would allow schools
to divert money from the neediest children. ``This piece of
legislation will actually be a step backward,'' said Sen. Paul
Wellstone, D-Minn., who was the lone senator who voted against the
bill.
</P>
<P>
   The legislation, which began as a pilot project in 12 states,
will allow all states to waive certain federal rules so schools
will have more leeway in how they spend the nearly $11 billion they
receive each year for seven different federal programs.
</P>
<P>
   States would have to apply to the Department of Education for a
statewide waiver. Once that was approved, individual school
districts could ask their state education agencies to be released
from various regulations.
</P>
<P>
   In Maryland, for instance, which is enrolled in the pilot
program, schools used federal money earmarked for teacher training
to hire additional teachers, thereby reducing class sizes.
</P>
<P>
   Other states in the pilot program, including Texas and Ohio,
were allowed to reduce their federal paperwork requirements.
</P>
<P>
   Jack MacDonald, an official with the Council of Chief State
School Officers, says he expects most states will apply for
waivers. ``It makes sense to allow states to tailor-make their
programs to their needs,'' he said. ``The legislation tries to make
it much easier for states to pull together their federal resources
and target them in ways they couldn't formerly do.''
</P>
<P>
   Gov. Thomas Carper of Delaware, a Democrat, who was a major
supporter of the bill, said he wanted his state to apply for
waivers to reduce paperwork requirements and to reallocate federal
money to reduce class sizes and expand prekindergarten programs.
</P>
<P>
   In New York, Alan Ray, a spokesman for the state Board of
Regents, which oversees education policy, said the education
commissioner, Richard Mills, supported the concept of increased
flexibility because it would allow schools to take money from
underused federal programs and direct it toward more pressing
needs.
</P>
<P>
   For instance, he said, a school where there are reading problems
might be able to take money intended for technology programs and
use it instead to hire tutors or increase training for reading
instructors.
</P>
<P>
   But he said that Mills had not decided whether New York should
apply for a waiver, saying he wanted to insure that the program
would protect the poorest children.

MATCH-UP PLEASES BLUES 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By BOB MCMANAMAN  
 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHOENIX - Don't blame the St. Louis Blues for wanting to do
everything in their power to make sure they met the Jeremy
Roenick-less Coyotes in the Stanley Cup playoffs.
</P>
<P>
   Each of the past three years, they have faced the Detroit Red
Wings in either the first or second round. Each of the past three
years, the Red Wings eliminated them. And after the two-time
defending Cup champions gorged themselves at the trading deadline
by picking up the likes of Chris Chelios, Ulf Samuelsson and Wendel
Clark, well, you figure it out.
</P>
<P>
   ``Of course we'd like to avoid Detroit,'' Blues right wing Scott
Young said. ``That's a reasonable statement for any team in this
conference. It's just that Detroit is so strong. If you look at
what they did at the deadline and what they did over the last two
years, nobody wants to play Detroit.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's not a knock against Phoenix. Even without Roenick,
they've got a lot of good leaders on that team and in no way are
they going to be an easy team to beat in this playoffs. Nobody
thinks that.''
</P>
<P>
   The Coyotes feel the same way about the Blues (37-32-13), who
finished strong to catch and move ahead of the Mighty Ducks of
Anaheim and nab the fifth overall seed in the West. They don't get
the respect of a Detroit, a Dallas or a Colorado, but make no
mistake, this isn't a team many clubs want to play, either.
</P>
<P>
   ``It all starts with the defensemen, Al MacInnis and Chris
Pronger,'' Coyotes captain Keith Tkachuk said. ``One of them's
always on the ice and they're both a pain in the butt. MacInnis,
because of that huge shot of his and Pronger, because he's so big
and it's tough to get the puck by him.''
</P>
<P>
   Because of their blueliners and Coach Joel Quenneville's patient
but efficient system in the neutral zone, the Blues led the NHL for
most of the season in fewest shots against.
</P>
<P>
   St. Louis went 11-4-4 in its final 19 regular-season games. The
power-play and penalty-killing units rank near the top of the
league. The Blues don't have a slew of superstars they don't even
have Brett Hull any longer but they think they have all the
necessary components to get past the Coyotes and not have to deal
with the Red Wings for at least the first two rounds.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think this is going to be a very competitive series,'' Blues
enforcer Tony Twist said. ``The difference in styles will be
energetic. There might be a clashing, they're might be a meshing.
Everything changes in the playoffs. Attitude changes. Drive
changes. Everybody's desire to win picks up about 10 notches, so
it's hard to equate how it's going to equal out when the end of the
day comes.
</P>
<P>
   ``Because of Detroit, it's been a pretty lackluster postseason
for us the last three years. I believe internally, we have a lot to
prove. We'd like to see ourselves graduate out of that Detroit funk
and make ourselves a competitor and a contender for the Cup.''
</P>
<P>
   The Blues will ride veteran goalie Grant Fuhr for as long as the
36-year-old can tolerate it. Fuhr, who captured five Stanley Cups
during the Edmonton Oilers' heyday with Wayne Gretzky, Mark
Messier, Jari Kurri and the rest, has undergone three surgeries on
his left knee.
</P>
<P>
   He returned after the latest one on March 13 and promptly
started in 15 of the Blues' final 17 games, winning 10 of them.
After St. Louis dispatched the Coyotes, 6-4, last week, Fuhr spent
nearly an hour in the visitor's training room icing down his sore
and tender knee.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm getting there,'' Fuhr said. ``Back-to-back games are a
little tough, but for the most part, it's been pretty good.''
</P>
<P>
   Twist said the Blues have all the confidence in the world in
Fuhr.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think without a doubt, giving his recent surgery, he's been
playing with a lot of vigor and he's not nearly as sore as he used
to be,'' Twist said. ``His performance speaks for itself. He's 36
years young. He's not playing like he's anywhere near 40, I'll tell
you that.''
</P>
<P>
   Another key player in the Blues' season, All-Star center Pavol
Demitra, isn't playing like your typical 24-year-old in just his
second full NHL season. The Czech Republic native, who won Olympic
gold a year ago in Nagano along with countrymen Robert Reichel and
Stan Neckar of the Coyotes, wound up with a team-high 89 points on
37 goals and 52 assists.
</P>
<P>
   He also scored a team-high 14 power-play goals and 10 winning
goals.
</P>
<P>
   ``Pavol Demitra. There's a guy who's definitely made the season
enjoyable for us,'' Twist said. ``We were missing some scoring
after losing Brett Hull (to Dallas via free agency) and Pavol
picked up the pace and he's been a real pleasant . . . I don't want
to say surprise, because it's not a surprise, I think it's been a
pleasant forthcoming. I didn't expect this consistency from him,
but I'm hoping it carries on.''
</P>
<P>
   Demitra, acquired in a 1996 trade from Ottawa in exchange for
Christer Olsson, is a little surprised himself.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've always waited for a season like this, but I never
expected it would be right now,'' he said. ``I'm playing with some
great guys and the coach is giving me a lot of ice time and on the
first power play. When you play with Al MacInnis, Chris Pronger,
(Pierre) Turgeon and all the guys from our team, it makes the job
so easy.''
</P>
<P>
   If MacInnis doesn't win the Norris Trophy, somebody should
launch an investigation, Demitra said.
</P>
<P>
   The Blues are peaking. They enter the playoffs on a roll. And
they just got veteran winger Geoff Courtnall back from a concussion
that sidelined him for most of the season. Until he's totally free
and clear of any leftover cobwebs, the Blues have the luxury of
skating him on their fourth line.
</P>
<P>
   Who would have thought all this was possible without Hull, who
for a decade ``was'' the St. Louis Blues?
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a whole different atmosphere now,'' Twist said. ``I want
to say not all of it is positive (without Hull around), but a lot
of it is. Hully's Hully. He's enjoyable in his own way. I enjoyed
having him around. But as goes with this game, you've got to move
on.'' &QL;

PRONGER READY FOR TKACHUK 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By PAOLA BOIVIN  
 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHOENIX - It's the only sure thing about this first-round
playoff series:  &UR; Chris Pronger vs.  &UR; Keith Tkachuk will be the best
match-up on the ice.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's all I'm thinking about,'' Coyotes forward Tkachuk said.
``I'm already having nightmares about him.''
</P>
<P>
   Watch for contact and lots of it when the two square off tonight
in Game One at America West Arena. St. Louis defenseman Pronger,
who always gets the responsibility of checking top opponents, will
be shadowing Tkachuk much of the evening.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think Pronger will probably be seeing a lot of him,'' Blues
Coach  &UR; Joel Quenneville said, smiling.
</P>
<P>
   Tkachuk, who is expected to make the move from left wing to
center, is not an easy shadow because he is gifted with strength
and finesse. But Pronger thrives in these types of showdowns and
has the instincts to make it interesting.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've got more than him to worry about over there,'' Pronger
said. ``They've got a lot of potent players that put the puck in
the net. I don't think we can worry about just one guy.'' &QL; 
A joint venture &QL; 
Don't talk about Grant's tomb yet. Although  &UR; Grant Fuhr's age _ 36
_ is often pointed out these days, and critics are quick to bury
the goalie, he's one of the main reasons the Blues are in Phoenix
tonight.
</P>
<P>
   Since Fuhr returned from arthroscopic knee surgery March 13, St.
Louis has gone 11-4-3, coming from eight points back to sneak past
Anaheim for fifth in the Western Conference standings. The Blues
avoided sixth place and a first-round match-up against two-time
champion Detroit.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's been a big part of our turnaround this year,'' Pronger
said. ``He's been a key to the way we've been playing lately.''
</P>
<P>
   Defenseman  &UR; Al MacInnis said, ``He's been the difference.''
</P>
<P>
   Fuhr was 9-4-3 with a 2.11 goals-against average in the 16 games
he played in since his return. Before his knee operation, he was
7-7-5 with a 2.70 goals-against mark.
</P>
<P>
   ``The main thing is, it has been a long time since the knee has
felt really good,'' Fuhr said. ``That's been the biggest boost.''
</P>
<P>
   It's a boost for St. Louis that Fuhr has a 15-1 career record
against the Phoenix/Winnipeg franchise during the playoffs,
although the goalie doesn't think history will play much of a role
tonight.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a different team,'' he said. ``They weren't really
Coyotes then, they were Jets. Every year is a new year. We just
want to go out and get off to a good start.'' &QL; 
Player movement &QL; 
Quenneville has downplayed the move, but his decision to
separate &UR; Pierre Turgeon and  &UR; Pavol Demitra and place them on
separate lines has been effective.
</P>
<P>
   Demitra, as the second-line center, posted 10 goals and 23
points in the Blues' past 18 games. Linemates  &UR; Michel Picard and
 &UR; Lubos
 &UR; Bartecko also have played well.
</P>
<P>
   ``We always mix and match when things aren't working out well,
and this turned out to be OK,'' Quenneville said. &QL; 
Color blind &QL; 
Quenneville acknowledged he's concerned about how his players will
respond to tonight's ``Whiteout,'' a tradition that started in
Winnipeg in which fans wear all white.
</P>
<P>
   But it's less the attire than the noise and intensity that
accompanies it that concerns the St. Louis coach.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's going to be loud,'' he said. ``It's probably something
we're not accustomed to. You don't want to be distracted by it.
Hopefully, we can get energized and take advantage of it and keep
our exposure.'' &QL;

   PHOENIX - The Coyotes might be without defenseman  &UR; J.J.
Daigneault tonight when they open the first round of the Stanley
Cup playoffs against the St. Louis Blues at America West Arena.
</P>
<P>
   Daigneault injured a hip flexor during Tuesday's practice, and
after further examination on Wednesday, team officials said it
won't be determined until pre-game warm-ups whether he can play.
</P>
<P>
   To guard against Daigneault's absence, the Coyotes recalled
defenseman  &UR; Brad Tiley from the Springfield Falcons of the American
Hockey League.
</P>
<P>
   The team also learned Wednesday that defenseman  &UR; Gerald Diduck,
who has been out because of a broken foot since March 5, is still
at least two weeks away from returning to action, but defenseman
 &UR; Deron Quint resumed skating with the team for the first time since
suffering a concussion on April 1 in Edmonton. &QL; 
Shame on you &QL; 
A hot goalie in the Stanley Cup playoffs can do a lot for a team.
He can carry his club to the next level and beyond. That's what the
Coyotes are hoping from  &UR; Nikolai Khabibulin, who in turn could lift
the play of his teammates with a Conn Smythe-type postseason.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sometimes when a goalie stands on his head, he kind of shames
you into another level,'' veteran right wing  &UR; Rick Tocchet said.
``After a period or two, you say, `This guy's keeping us in the
game, I better do more. I've got to play better.'
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know if shame is the right word. Maybe it's inspire.
You feel guilty. If a goalie's keeping you in it, game in and game
out, you feel guilty that you're not helping him. That's a boost
that a goalie can do for a team.'' &QL; 
Tickets remaining &QL; 
The Coyotes announced that 1,000 tickets remain for tonight's Game
1 at America West Arena and 1,500 remain for Game 2 Saturday at
noon. The team also said gates will open two hours before faceoff
throughout home playoff games and encourages fans to arrive early.
</P>
<P>
   Also, for $15 fans will receive a $10 ticket, a Million Fan
T-shirt, a white pompon and a gift certificate for a one
Whataburger. The package is available on the Internet at
www.phoenixcoyotes.com or by calling (480) 563-PUCK. &QL; 
Slap shots &QL; 
 &UR; Dallas Drake on moving from right wing to left wing with  &UR; Keith
 &UR; Tkachuk, who will center the line with  &UR; Shane Doan on the right:
</P>
<P>
   ``I think I'm a better right winger than I am a left winger, but
if you can't switch when you get to this level, there's something
wrong. It won't be a hard switch for me. The good thing about it is
I'm on my forehand a little bit more and I might get to shoot a
little more. I don't know if that's OK with (Tkachuk), though. I'll
have to ask him.''
</P>
<P>
   Defenseman  &UR; Jyrki Lumme has battled a sore shoulder throughout
the second half of the season and it still isn't 100 percent. But
the emotional rush of the playoffs will do a lot to dull the pain.
</P>
<P>
   ``Once the games start, it's a totally different story,'' he
said. ``I feel a whole lot better now, but it'll be even better
when we get going here.''
</P>
<P>
   Defenseman  &UR; Keith Carney, who played for the U.S. Olympic team
in Nagano a year ago along with Tkachuk and injured center  &UR; Jeremy
Roenick, said he gladly would accept another invitation to
participate if the NHL decides to suspend its season and allow
players to go again at the 2002 Games in Salt Lake City.
</P>
<P>
   ``Absolutely. I'd love the chance to do it again,'' he said. &QL;

DOW JONES ANNUAL MEETING USED AS FORUM FOR A PROTEST 
</HEADLINE>
  (jt) 
 By FELICITY BARRINGER    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Spearheaded by two Wall Street Journal reporters who
just won the Pulitzer Prize, about 100 employees told the annual
stockholders meeting of Dow Jones &AMP; Co. Wednesday that proposed
cuts in pension benefits for more than half of the company's 8,300
employees are sapping loyalty and could provoke a strike.
</P>
<P>
   Bob Davis, the White House reporter of one of the two
top-selling newspapers in the country, told the gathering on the
106th floor of the World Trade Center that he wanted ``to alert the
Dow Jones shareholders to the anger and resentment in the newsroom
over management's decision to slash our retirement benefits.''
</P>
<P>
   Davis, one of a six-member team that won the 1999 Pulitzer Prize
for international reporting last week, added, ``I believe workers
would rather strike than accept management's terms.''
</P>
<P>
   Through January, Dow Jones each year has paid 15 percent of the
salaries of vested employees into a retirement account. But shortly
after this year's contribution was deposited, Peter R. Kann, the
chairman and chief executive of the company, said that the 15
percent payments _ technically designated as profit sharing _ could
not be sustained when the company's profits had lagged for several
years running.
</P>
<P>
   At the moment, the company is negotiating a new pension
arrangement with the Independent Association of Publishers'
Employees. The union numbers 2,400 Dow Jones employees among its
members and, since January 1997, has been an affiliate of the
Communications Workers of America.
</P>
<P>
   The initial Dow Jones proposal, according to both the union and
company executives, would provide employees with a 5 percent
benefit from company funds. In addition, employees could contribute
up to 6 percent of their salaries toward a pension, with the
company matching 50 percent of the employees' contribution.
</P>
<P>
   That proposal, last year, would have cost the company $21
million, as opposed to the $40 million it actually paid to about
5,500 company employees.
</P>
<P>
   Davis' allusion to a strike was not echoed by any of the
negotiators for the union; indeed, as long as the contract remains
in effect, employees are barred from such an action.
</P>
<P>
   Dow Jones' annual meeting has not been devoid of protests
before, but participants in Wednesday's protest said it was unusual
for prominent Journal reporters to take the lead in such an action.
</P>
<P>
   Kann's opening speech to shareholders alluded to the complaints
even before they were made. Looking out at dozens of his employees
sitting among the audience of investors, he said, ``The company is
determined to make sure that the compensation packages we offer
employees remain fully competitive.'' The company's opening offer,
he said, ``would already equate with what our competitors do, on
average.''
</P>
<P>
   Steve Liesman, another reporter on the Pulitzer-Prize winning
international reporting team, followed Davis to the microphone and
predicted there would be a potential loss of shareholder value if
journalists brought less commitment to their work. ``You can't
punch it into a spreadsheet,'' he said, ``but it's there.''
</P>
<P>
   In response, Kann said, ``I do understand the depth of feeling
on this,'' although he added, ``I do not think this is a productive
forum for negotiating this issue.''
</P>
<P>
   The poor performance of the company's market information
business, Telerate, depressed earnings for several years before Dow
Jones sold Telerate to Bridge Information Systems. Dow Jones had a
net loss of $802 million in 1997 and net income of just $8.4
million in 1998.

   LITTLETON, Colo. _ They will never forget where they were when
the alarm went off.
</P>
<P>
   Josh Casey had just opened a bag of potato chips in the
lunchroom. Steve Broden was taking a test on the digestive system
in sophomore biology. Stephanie Bresee was waiting for her gym
classmates to finish changing so they could head out to the
baseball diamond.
</P>
<P>
   They are teen-agers, and this is high school, after all, so they
groaned and dropped their stuff and started to line up for yet
another fire drill. But this was no false alarm.
</P>
<P>
   As gunshots and explosions rocked the campus of Columbine High
School, rocked their very world, the students descended into their
own private nightmares. For some, it lasted only a few minutes, as
they sprinted through hallways and climbed over ars to the safety
of a nearby park and library. For others, it was an hours-long
siege behind locked doors and in cramped closets, clueless about
the craziness outside and unsure when help would come.
</P>
<P>
   Michelle Alsom could not hear the alarm. She was miles away at
the Cherry Creek Mall, running an errand. She is a 26-year-old
parademic, long since graduated from fire drills. But soon the
buzzer went off on the pager on her hip, and she, too, will never
forget the moment.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's my job and I'm proud to be doing it,'' Ms. Alsom said,
trembling and sobbing as she told her story to a priest in the park
adjacent to Columbine on Wednesday afternoon. Ms. Alsom does not
live anywhere near Littleton, but she came back, she said, because
``I needed some closure.''
</P>
<P>
   The authorities say they still do not have many details about
the architecture of the rampage that left 15 dead, including the
two presumed gunmen, who apparently killed themselves, and more
than 20 injured at Columbine on Tuesday. They do not know when the
two died, or how many rounds they fired, or who they shot at first
or last.
</P>
<P>
   An officer assigned to the school, Neil Gardner of the Jefferson
County Sheriff's Department, heard an explosion about 11:30 a.m.
and went to an area near the cafeteria, said Steve Davis, a
sheriff's spokesman. Gardner ``saw one of the gunmen firing,''
Davis said, and ``laid down some fire.'' Then, two other deputies
fired at the gunmen, though all the shots apparently missed.
</P>
<P>
   Law-enforcement officers did not encounter the suspected gunmen
again, Davis said, until their bodies turned up in the library
about 4 p.m. The rest of the time, he said, hundreds of officers
from two dozen agencies ``very slowly, quietly and methodically
swept through the building.''
</P>
<P>
   In the hours before the police secured the building, a different
drama unfolded behind every door.
</P>
<P>
   What people everywhere else heard, those in the cafeteria saw. A
student in a black trench coat raced by the windows, firing all the
time. A bomb went off in someone's trunk in the adjacent senior
parking lot.
</P>
<P>
   ``I looked up and looked out the window and saw two people
laying on the ground,'' recalled Bo Baribeau, a 15-year-old
freshman. Wondering if there had been a fight, he went outside to
see what was happening. ``Once we got close,'' he said, ``we saw
the blood.''
</P>
<P>
   From the lunchroom, students saw the gunman racing down the
hallway. A janitor ordered them to duck under the table. Then the
janitor exhorted them to escape. Bo raced through the foreign
language hall in what became a stampede. ``About 100 kids, bam,
just hit the streets, and went and jumped over the cars and, bam,
went into the park,'' he said, almost breathless again.
</P>
<P>
   But Josh Casey, also 15, could not get to the door. He was one
of about 30 students who crammed, instead, into an elevator,
seeking safety upstairs in the library. When they got there,
though, the smoke from the bombs and the mist from the fire
sprinkler system was blinding. They went down again avoiding,
unknowingly, the death trap the library was to become.
</P>
<P>
   Back on the first floor, two teachers locked the students in the
cafeteria and everyone sat underneath a chair, Josh said. Then the
janitor returned, once again telling the crowd to flee. So they
ran.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just kept hearing all the gunshots and the pipe bombs,''
Josh said today. ``I didn't care to look back.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Upstairs in the science wing, there was no place to run.
</P>
<P>
   Steve Broden and his classmates were chewing on pencils,
searching for answers about the digestive system, when William
David Sanders, a business teacher and coach, burst through the
door.
</P>
<P>
   ``He came in with two shots in his back,'' Steve said of the
teacher, who died. ``He just came in and fell on his face and
busted a bunch of teeth.''
</P>
<P>
   The students quickly knocked over the tables and crouched behind
them, as four or five other teachers brought their classes into the
room. One female teacher spent hours on a cell phone getting advice
for how to care for Sanders, Steve said, and many students took
their shirts off to help mop up the blood.
</P>
<P>
   Orders to stay quiet lasted for about an hour, Steve said, but
then emotion overcame them. Girls screamed. Boys cried. People with
cell phones were frantically making calls. ``We were just talking
about our families,'' he said, ``trying to keep ourselves happy.''
</P>
<P>
   It was about 3 p.m., Steve recalled, when the teacher on the
cell phone said SWAT teams were about to rescue them. Another 30
minutes passed, and she said it again. Still nothing.
</P>
<P>
   Next door, another biology class was crammed into a supply
closet, first laying down on top of one another under sinks and
scientific paraphernalia, then sitting so close they felt each
other's breath.
</P>
<P>
   ``Gunshots kept going off forever it seemed,'' said Jessica
Cave, a 16-year-old sophomore, who spoke with her mothers arms
wrapped tightly around her sinewy figure. ``I was just hoping I'd
see my mother again.''
</P>
<P>
   Jessica said the students at times got noisy.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was just like a war zone for, like, two and a half hours,''
said Jason Baer, who was also in the closet. ``I was wondering
where the cops were.''
</P>
<P>
   Jason said that the teacher asked him, at one point, to peek out
the closet window. He saw SWAT officers. ``They clapped their hands
and all of a sudden rifles were pointed at me,'' he recalled. ``I
dropped back down.''
</P>
<P>
   Shortly, the students in the closet heard SWAT officers talking
about ramming down the door. They called out. They were rescued.
</P>
<P>
   ``We ran down the stairs, and there was blood everywhere,''
Jason said. ``We had to jump over dead bodies to get out.''
</P>
<P>
   Davis, the sheriff's department spokesman, said the first
officers arrived on the scene just three minutes after the initial
call to 911. A makeshift SWAT team entered the building 20 minutes
later, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Sgt. George Hinkle and his SWAT crew from the Lakewood Police
Department moved in at 1:02 p.m. Students had said, via cell phone,
that the gunmen were exchanging clothes with the hostages, so every
student leaving the building had to be searched, Hinkle said. ``It
was chaos outside,'' he said, ``It was a different sort of chaos
inside.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Alsom, the paramedic, had shared a turkey sandwich on a park
bench with her mother, a stockbroker, and then gone into the mall
to exchange something that was the wrong size. Moments later, she
was speeding toward Littleton, lights blazing, sirens wailing.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was being briefed via my pager and on my cell phone and on
my radio,'' said Ms. Alsom, who has been a paramedic for nine years
and said was the only one from her department, North Metro, to
respond. ``The word was multiple gunshots, possible bombing.''
</P>
<P>
   The first victim was a young woman ``who we thought was probably
the worst, at the time,'' Ms. Alsom explained. She had been shot
several times in the abdomen. But they kept coming.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Alsom was one of the first emergency workers to arrive at
about 11:40 a.m. There were three triage centers set up, and the
students came through in waves. First, groups of critical patients
who had been shot. Then scores of escapees with cuts and scrapes
and sprains. Then a lull. Then hundreds more students, some
struggling to breath after hours in hiding.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had neighbors coming out with blankets, with band-aids,
four by four gauze,'' she said. ``They were bringing kids into
their homes, giving them beverages.'' It was 6 p.m. before Ms.
Alsom left the scene.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm just worried about these kids,'' she said. ``I worked in
Chicago when I was in college and I witnessed the same thing, and I
still have nightmares.''
</P>
<P>
   Tuesday night, she said, she did not dare sleep.

CONCERNS ON PROFILING CONTINUE TO SIMMER

<P>
   TRENTON, N.J. _ A day after Gov. Christie Whitman vowed to
revamp the New Jersey State Police to end racial profiling, there
were few indications Wednesday that the governor's assurances had
eased the public furor over the issue or defused the political
threat it poses to her nominee to the State Supreme Court, Attorney
General Peter G. Verniero.
</P>
<P>
   After denying for years that troopers used race as the basis for
stopping motorists on the New Jersey Turnpike, the governor said
Tuesday that she was both disappointed and surprised to learn that
it was taking place. The administration released a 112-page
preliminary report, which included a plan to prevent the illegal
stops and searches.
</P>
<P>
   Civil rights leaders welcomed the governor's acknowledgement of
the racial profiling, saying it belatedly validates thousands of
complaints minority motorists have made for more than a decade. But
the executive director of the Black Ministers Council of New
Jersey, the Rev. Reginald T. Jackson, said the profiling report
still understated the breadth of the racial problems on the force
and failed to address the more complex problem of changing the
culture of the state police.
</P>
<P>
   Inside the New Jersey State House, where the issue has been
simmering for nearly a year, there were also signs Wednesday that
support for Verniero's nomination may be softening among the
governor's fellow Republicans. Sen. Jack G. Sinagra, said Wednesday
that he would oppose Verniero's nomination unless the attorney
general won the recommendation of the New Jersey State Bar
Association's Judicial and Prosecutor Appointments Committee.
</P>
<P>
   And in a move likely to heighten pressure on the governor,
Jackson also announced Wednesday that the Rev. Al Sharpton would
speak on Friday at a rally on the steps of the State House. The
rally will mark the one-year anniversary of an incident in which
troopers shot and wounded three unarmed minority men after a
traffic stop on the turnpike. Jackson said the protesters would
demand a public apology from Mrs. Whitman and present a list of
proposed changes to state police policy.

<P>
   NEW YORK _ A few months ago, Sandy Lombardo saw a full-page
newspaper ad for a scholarship that promised to send his child to
the private school of his choice. Driven by his dissatisfaction
with the local public schools and a yearning for a better life
outside the neighborhood, Lombardo filled out the application,
mailed it off and forgot about it.
</P>
<P>
   On Monday, he got a call: Out of more than 1.2 million families
across America who applied for the 40,000 four-year scholarships
for needy students, his son, John Thomas, a 10-year-old in fifth
grade at Public School 71 in the Bronx, was a winner.
</P>
<P>
   Wednesday, Lombardo and his family were picked up by a stretch
limousine at their Bronx apartment, driven to the Grand Hyatt Hotel
in Manhattan for breakfast and dropped off at New York City's grand
old public library for a lavish celebration of their good fortune.
</P>
<P>
   To Lombardo, a strapping man hobbled by a back injury on the
job, the scholarship held out the promise that his son would not
repeat his own mistakes _ getting lost in a huge, uncaring factory
of a high school and ultimately dropping out.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's an American dream come true for us,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Lombardo's billionaire benefactors, Theodore J. Forstmann, a
Wall Street financier, and John T. Walton, heir to the Wal-Mart
fortune, presided Wednesday as the Lombardos and 32 other
low-income families from as far as Baltimore, Iowa and Dallas,
celebrated winning the scholarships. The New York ceremony was one
of 37 held simultaneously across the country.
</P>
<P>
   Beyond the public relations brouhaha, it was clear that
Forstmann's and Walton's immense wealth and charity, and the
dream-come-true of people like Lombardo, had put public education
on the defensive. The sheer volume of applications illustrated the
deep discontent of low-income families with the public schools.
</P>
<P>
   In the two-and-a-half-hour New York ceremony, attended by an
assortment of business, political and civil rights leaders, the
word vouchers _ the code for the political movement toward taxpayer
financing of private schools _ never came up. But it was in the
background.
</P>
<P>
   Walton compared the response to his scholarship program to the
labor, suffragist and civil rights movements. Andrew Young, the
civil rights leader and former U.N. representative, invoked Rosa
Parks.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the words of the old Negro spiritual: Great Day!'' Young
thundered, addressing the audience of about 300 families, business
and political leaders. `I don't think when Rosa Parks sat down she
knew what she was doing. I know that the students who had the first
sit-ins didn't know what they were doing. I don't think John Walton
and Ted Forstmann knew what they were doing. I still don't think
they know what they're doing.''
</P>
<P>
   Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani, making a brief appearance, noted that
168,000 New York City residents _ nearly a third of those eligible
_ had applied. Saying that schools chancellor Rudy Crew had made
improvements, he nonetheless added, ``That's a remarkable number of
parents and children who want to be in a school other than the
school that they're in.''
</P>
<P>
   It was easy for Lombardo to dismiss the talk as politics. ``Then
again, the school system is a lot of politics,'' he said. ``You
can't run away from that.'' But he did not so readily dismiss the
importance of the scholarship to his son.
</P>
<P>
   He hopes to send John Thomas to Mount St. Michael, a Catholic
school, which he expects will promote values and discipline. ``If
he could go into a yeshiva, and it's just as good, so be it,''
Lombardo said. ``It's got to be better than what the system is. He
needs guidance, he needs the right school, he needs a teacher.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Lombardo, unable to work because of the back injury, feeds his
family of three small children with his disability payments. He
said he had not yet been told how much money his son would receive,
though he knew the scholarships will be between $600 and $1,600.
But he said he would do whatever it took to raise any shortfall in
tuition.
</P>
<P>
   Nearby, Carol Madden, who lives in Hillside, N.J., said she was
a product of the public schools but believed that they had gone
downhill in the years since she had attended. Her daughter Alyssa
is just finishing kindergarten, she said, and has learned very
little.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Madden wants to send Alyssa to the Kent Place School, in
Summit, N.J. ``You have entree to a lot of things if you graduate
from that school.''
</P>
<P>
   A single mother, she already works two jobs. She will take a
third job, she said, if necessary.
</P>
<P>
   The scholarship has cracked open a door, she said, ``and I'm
going to kick it open _ by whatever means necessary.''
</P>
<P>
   Her only regret, she said, is that she had to choose between her
two children _ Alyssa and Moneisha _ when she applied. She picked
the younger child, who is just starting out. Moneisha, who is 10,
understands, she said.

nobody said it was going to be easy.''

   LITTLETON, Colo. _ The two Columbine High School seniors worked
last Friday making pizzas. On Monday, they went bowling. And on
Tuesday, it seems, they committed mass murder.
</P>
<P>
   Nobody had taken Eric Harris and Dylan Klebold seriously.
</P>
<P>
   They wore long black coats and hung with a clique of
middle-class suburban teen-agers that called itself the trench-coat
mafia. They lived with the familiar trappings of suburban comfort
in a town with glorious views of the Rocky Mountain foothills.
</P>
<P>
   They struck sullen, brooding poses. They talked about Hitler and
wore clothes with German insignia. In February they had completed a
``diversion program'' for first-time juvenile offenders, after
their arrest for breaking into a van and stealing electronic
equipment, according to the Jefferson County district attorney.
</P>
<P>
   The other students, who came to know Harris and Klebold from
mingling in the hallways and the commons, said the two youths had
wanted to portray themselves as rebels or villains. But they were
mostly viewed as losers. ``They were just a little weird,'' said
Dara Ferguson, a 17-year-old junior and a cheerleader. ``They
wanted to be different.''
</P>
<P>
   Late Tuesday night, after the mass shooting at the high school,
agents of the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms, acting on a
warrant, searched the Harris house at the end of a cul-de-sac in
Columbine Knolls, an 11-year-old subdivision they had moved to two
years ago when Eric Harris' father retired from the military and
took a civilian job.
</P>
<P>
   The agents carted away computers, computer printouts, gas cans,
boxes of matches, videocassettes and bags of books, including one
titled ``Doom,'' after the computer game. Reporters did not see any
weapons removed from the house.
</P>
<P>
   On Monday, the Harrises' next-door neighbor, Bill Konen, had
been working in his yard when he heard Dylan Klebold drive up and
ask Eric, ``Do you have a metal baseball bat?''
</P>
<P>
   ``For the next 15 minutes, they were breaking bottles in a
sack,'' Konen continued. ``Apparently, they were making shrapnel.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would never have figured in a million years that bomb-making
activities were going on, or any suspicious activities,'' he said,
standing in his driveway, near a neighborhood watch association
sign.
</P>
<P>
   Some classmates said Eric Harris was good with computers, and
apparently maintained a Web site on America Online. Files on the
Web site, discovered after the shootings, depicted him as an avid
player of Doom and Quake, two popular computer games in which
players stalk their opponents through dungeon-like environments and
try to kill them with high-powered weapons.
</P>
<P>
   The files on Harris' Doom and Quake exploits contained programs
he had written to work with the games, as well as his commentary on
them. But despite coming in the context of computer games famous
for their realistic violence, these files, scattered with
enthusiastic observations and exclamation points, provided a
glimpse at a teenager who seemed less angry and morbid than in the
other postings attributed to him.
</P>
<P>
   ``It took me about 10 hours to finish this level, so send some
comments to me once in awhile!'' Harris wrote in one file, dated
Nov. 26, 1996. His comments accompanied a program that he made
available to the public on an Internet site.
</P>
<P>
   Harris was listed as the author on dozens of files known as
``wads,'' which allow players to add new levels of their own design
to the games. In one file, he thanked Dylan Klebold for helping him
test his program.
</P>
<P>
   John C. Dvorak, a columnist at PC Magazine who discovered the
site through his own Internet sleuthing on Wednesday, said he was
struck by the ingenuousness of Harris' writing.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's just kid-like,'' Dvorak said. `That's what's so troubling
about it.''
</P>
<P>
   Also on Wednesday, the Simon Wiesenthal Institute, a group that
monitors hate groups, said two of its researchers had come across
the Harris Web site several months ago. ``What both people
remembered was how we got to that site, which was by looking at
various anarchy and bomb-making listings,'' said Rabbi Abraham
Cooper, associate dean of the institute.
</P>
<P>
   He said there were no threats that merited contacting
law-enforcement officials or enough hate language to be listed on
the institute's hate site list.
</P>
<P>
   On Wednesday, Dylan Klebold's father, Tom, a geologist, and
mother, Sue, who works for the Arapahoe County schools, issued a
statement: ``We cannot begin to convey our overwhelming sense of
sorrow for everyone affected by this tragedy. Our thoughts, prayers
and heartfelt apologies go out to the victims, their families,
friends and the entire community.''
</P>
<P>
   Classmates described Klebold as tall and skinny, a bit gangly,
with shaggy blonde hair. Harris was much shorter and dark-haired.
Both favored the all-black attire known as part of ``goth,'' the
fashion of the mock-gothic musical subculture known for a
fascination with death.
</P>
<P>
   There is no known connection between the students' interest in
goth or violent computer games and their rampage on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   A photograph of Klebold in the 1998 yearbook is accompanied by a
statement. ``After going through many experiences in their lives,''
it read, ``often times students have regrets of past actions.''
</P>
<P>
   Columbine is regarded as a top-notch school, one of the draws to
Littleton. A sheriff's deputy is posted to the school, but students
say the officer's duties have mostly centered on catching students
who park in faculty spaces.
</P>
<P>
   Athletic prowess was often the way to popularity at Columbine,
as at many schools, and students here say Harris and Klebold, who
did not play sports, detested athletes.
</P>
<P>
   ``The athletes get a lot of attention at school,'' said Kristin
Couris, a 17-year-old junior and lacrosse player, who said the
school's closed-circuit television often carried accounts of
ball-field heroics. ``They didn't like that.''
</P>
<P>
   Jeff Matthews, a 16-year-old junior, said Klebold and Harris had
turned to the trenchcoat group because they did not fit with any
other group. ''I guess when you have a lack of friends, you feel
unwanted,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Sara Schweitzberger, 15, had a gym class with Klebold, and said
it was obvious he felt socially ostracized. ''He really felt
unloved,'' she said. ``He wasn't so bad. He was lonely. I just wish
I could give him a hug and tell him that I care.''
</P>
<P>
   The trenchcoat group, which numbered from 10 to 30 students in a
school of nearly 2,000, would usually keep its distance from the
other students, often gathering under the steps during lunchtime,
while everyone else ate at cafeteria tables.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a pretty preppie, conservative school,'' said Lindsey
Jackson, a 17-year-old junior. ``Kids wear Ambercrombie, Tommy
Hilfiger, American Eagle.''
</P>
<P>
   But Monica Schuster, a 17-year-old senior, said that she and a
companion had double dated with Klebold and a friend of his at the
senior prom last Saturday night.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had a great time,'' she said.

WILLI STOPH, 84, FORMER PREMIER OF EAST GERMANY 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By WOLFGANG SAXON   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Willi Stoph, a two-time prime minister of East Germany, who
reluctantly helped reconcile the two Germanys and held office until
days before the Berlin Wall fell in 1989, died April 13 in Berlin.
He was 84.
</P>
<P>
   His death was reported in Berlin on Monday by the Party of
Democratic Socialism, heir to the East German Communist Party.
</P>
<P>
   Stoph served largely in the shadow of East Germany's autocratic
party chiefs, Walter Ulbricht and Erich Honecker. He was detained
and put on trial in the reunited Berlin on charges related to
official misconduct and to the shoot-to-kill orders against
fugitives along the East German borders.
</P>
<P>
   As in the case of Honecker, the prosecution was halted because
of failing health. Honecker died in self-imposed exile in Chile in
1994.
</P>
<P>
   Stoph gained worldwide recognition in 1970 by meeting with West
German Chancellor Willy Brandt in Erfurt, where a crowd of East
Germans greeted the visitor like a conquering hero. The occasion
was in keeping with Brandt's so-called Ostpolitik, his policy of
seeking better relations with the East.
</P>
<P>
   But it took another two-and-a-half years to negotiate initial
ties between the two Germanys. Among the many snags to a semblance
of real reconciliation was the embarrassment suffered by Prime
Minister Stoph in 1984 when five of his own relatives sought
political asylum in the West.
</P>
<P>
   A former bricklayer and longtime Communist, Stoph saw his star
rise in a hierarchy dominated by men who had spent World War II in
Soviet exile. He, in contrast, served in the German army on the
Russian front.
</P>
<P>
   Taken prisoner, he attended an ``anti-fascist school'' for
German POWs, soon impressing party functionaries as a trustworthy
man and diligent worker. He was assigned to economic reconstruction
in the Soviet zone of postwar Germany and rose to the top in 1952
as interior minister.
</P>
<P>
   In charge of internal security, he helped Soviet troops put down
a workers' uprising in East Berlin the next year. He also joined
the Communist Party's powerful Politburo in 1953.
</P>
<P>
   From 1956 to 1960 he was defense minister and presided over the
formation of the People's Army after the creation of the German
Democratic Republic. He then was named first deputy prime minister
and, in 1964, prime minister.
</P>
<P>
   At the time, he was seen as the heir apparent to Ulbricht, but
was checked by Ulbricht's eventual successor, Honecker. Stoph
apparently paid Honecker back by helping to engineer the latter's
ouster in 1989, shortly before the East German state collapsed.
</P>
<P>
   By 1969, when Brandt, a Social Democrat, became chancellor, the
Russians and other East Europeans were eager to pursue better
relations with Bonn. The Ostpolitik he outlined before Parliament
matched that trend.
</P>
<P>
   It prescribed coexistence between the Germanys, and the Kremlin
soon began to put pressure on the East Germans to pursue it. East
Berlin initially responded with a chorus of vituperation, often led
by Stoph.
</P>
<P>
   The reaction echoed the hatred between Communists and Socialist
Democrats in the pre-Hitler era that crippled their efforts to stem
the rise of Nazism. But Soviet impatience and feelers from all
sides brought about the encounter in Erfurt and the unrestrained
enthusiasm in the streets for Brandt.
</P>
<P>
   A follow-up meeting in West Germany made no progress toward a
larger accord. Yet a faltering economy and disaffection among
workers helped to keep things moving along as an ailing Ulbricht
was relegated to a ceremonial post in 1971 and Honecker took over.
</P>
<P>
   Stoph, too, was sidelined for two years until Honecker was
forced to shuffle the hierarchy in 1976 and reinstall him as a
prime minister who got things done the way the Politburo decreed.
But even then, he repeatedly stayed away from the office to undergo
medical treatment, reportedly for ulcers.
</P>
<P>
   A handsome man of military bearing, Stoph was born in Berlin,
the son of a laborer, and worked as a mason and construction
foreman before serving in the artillery during the war. He joined
the Communist Youth League at age 14 and the party in 1931.
</P>
<P>
   Stoph was married and had four children, but there was no
information about survivors.

   TECHNOLOGY SHARES CLIMB AS STOCK RALLY CONTINUES
</P>
<P>
   Strong profit reports helped fuel a rally in stocks as
technology and consumer issues appeared to regain the leadership
they long enjoyed. Stocks tied to the business cycle, meanwhile,
mostly paused after their recent jumps.
</P>
<P>
   The NASDAQ composite index posted a gain of 79.44 points, or 3.3
percent, to 2,489.08. Combined with Tuesday's rebound, that wiped
out Monday's 5.56 percent slide. The Dow Jones industrial average
climbed 132.87 points, to 10,581.42, a record. The Standard &AMP;
Poor's 500-stock index increased by 29.95 points, or 2.3 percent,
to 1,336.12.
</P>
<P>
   BREAKING AN INTERNET MONOPOLY
</P>
<P>
   America Online was one of five companies chosen to compete with
a government-backed monopoly in the lucrative business of assigning
Internet domains. The surprising choice introduced a seemingly
formidable competitor to the business and prompted questions about
whether smaller companies would ever effectively compete.
</P>
<P>
   BORDERS CHIEF RESIGNS ABRUPTLY
</P>
<P>
   Just a little more than five months after boasting about hiring
Philip M. Pfeffer, a longtime book industry executive, as its chief
executive, Borders Group unceremoniously announced his abrupt
departure. The company, the second-largest bookseller in the nation
after Barnes &AMP; Noble, also said that its first-quarter earnings
would be 4 to 5 cents a share, lower than analysts' estimates of 7
cents.
</P>
<P>
   RUBIN OFFERS PLAN TO AVOID RISK
</P>
<P>
   Secretary of the Treasury Robert E. Rubin outlined a modest
five-point American plan for warding off the kind of financial
crisis that rocked three continents over the last two years. But
his proposals, which President Clinton endorsed on Tuesday, fell
well short of creating the new ``global financial architecture''
that many policy makers debated in the heat of the crisis in
emerging markets last fall.
</P>
<P>
   COMPAQ POSTS DISMAL EARNINGS
</P>
<P>
   Confirming the bad news that led to the ouster of its chief
executive this week, Compaq Computer announced that it earned half
of what analysts had expected only two weeks ago. The company's
chairman and acting chief executive called the results unacceptable
but declined to provide much information to illuminate the sources
of Compaq's problems or to outline its path back to financial
health.
</P>
<P>
   Coca-Cola's first-quarter earnings declined 13 percent,
continuing a recent pattern of weak results.
</P>
<P>
   Sunbeam, still struggling with the effects of excessive
inventories and heavy debt, turned in another round of poor
results.
</P>
<P>
   SEC CHARGES PAIRGAIN SUSPECT
</P>
<P>
   The Securities and Exchange Commission accused Gary D. Hoke Jr.,
an employee of Pairgain Technologies, of stock price manipulation
in connection with a fake news report about a takeover of Pairgain
that was posted on an Internet site. The charges echo the federal
fraud charges filed against Hoke last week.

RIGHTS INQUIRY ON 2 ARRESTS IN THE SLAYING OF AN OFFICER 
</HEADLINE>
  (jt) 
 By ROBERT HANLEY    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   HACKENSACK, N.J. _ Federal authorities have started an
investigation into possible civil rights violations in the arrests
of two men during the tangled search for the killer of a police
officer in Orange, N.J.
</P>
<P>
   Both men were mistakenly identified by witnesses in the case.
The officer, Joyce Anne Carnegie, was shot as she investigated
three robberies on April 8.
</P>
<P>
   One of the men, Terrance Everett, 24, who contends that the
arresting officers beat him in his home on April 10, was held on
murder charges for six days before detectives verified his alibi
and released him. The other, Earl Faison, 27, a lifelong asthmatic,
collapsed and died in the Orange Police Headquarters on April 11,
less than hour after an Orange patrolman ordered him from a cab.
The cause of Faison's death is still unknown.
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. Attorney for New Jersey, Faith S. Hochberg, began the
investigation into events surrounding both arrests earlier this
week, a spokesman, Michael Drewniak, said Wednesday. Drewniak
declined any other comment, saying the investigation was still in
its preliminary stages.
</P>
<P>
   On Monday, after the weekend arrest of a fourth suspect in the
case, the Essex County prosecutor, Patricia A. Hurt, defended the
performance of law enforcement authorities in the early stages of
her office's investigation of Officer Carnegie's shooting. Ms. Hurt
said Everett, Faison, and a third man arrested early in the
investigation, James Coker, 29, of Newark, all matched witnesses'
descriptions of the murderer _ a bald-headed black man with a
goatee.
</P>
<P>
   With the arrest on Saturday of the latest suspect, Condell
Woodson, 25, of Newark, on murder charges, Ms. Hurt said detectives
were satisfied that none of the three arrested before him were
implicated in either the three street robberies that Officer
Carnegie was investigating at the time she was shot or in her
murder.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Hochberg's investigation does not involve Coker, Drewniak
said. He declined to explain why.
</P>
<P>
   Coker was arrested on drug charges. There have been no
allegations that he was beaten during his arrest.
</P>
<P>
   During her news conference on Monday, Ms. Hurt said she had
asked the New Jersey Attorney General, Peter G. Verniero, to
supersede her office in the Everett case and investigate his
charges of being beaten by members of a law enforcement task force
who arrested him. She has not asked Verniero's office to
investigate Faison's death.
</P>
<P>
   Faison's father, Earl Williams, charged last week, after viewing
photographs of his son's body, that he was beaten to death by
Orange police officers.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Hurt's office said last week that the Essex County Medical
Examiner's office had ruled out kicking, strangulation or beating
as a cause of Faison's death. But it said it could not determine
the cause of death until chemical and other tests were completed.  &QL;

AS BOAT ROCKS, GRUNFELD IS PUSHED OVERBOARD 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By SELENA ROBERTS   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Someone had to be held responsible for the Knicks'
plunge into mediocrity this season, their perilous flirtation with
missing the playoffs and the organizational rifts that had
developed over the shortened season. Wednesday, on the heels of a
four-game losing streak, Ernie Grunfeld became that person when
Madison Square Garden president Dave Checketts dismissed Grunfeld
from his position as team president and general manager.
</P>
<P>
   The change came with eight games remaining in the regular season
and the Knicks facing the prospect of an idle post-season for the
first time in 12 years. It came after a two-month dispute between
Grunfeld and coach Jeff Van Gundy over how to use personnel that
had resulted in mistrust between them and that had filtered down to
the players. In addition, several other problems had arisen
involving on-court and off-court issues, cloaking the team in
controversy as it enters the most crucial phase of the season.
</P>
<P>
   Checketts will assume Grunfeld's responsibilities immediately in
an attempt to eliminate the rifts, get the team back on the same
page and refocus them on the goal of making the playoffs.
</P>
<P>
   ``This was not a power struggle that was won by somebody,''
Checketts said in a news conference at Madison Square Garden.
``It's never one loss or losing streak. That's not how you make the
decision. It was much more of the continued direction where
critical people throughout the organization did not support the
mission. And there was a division, clearly, and I hold them and
myself responsible.''
</P>
<P>
   Grunfeld, who accepted a position as a special consultant with
the Knicks, had been the team's general manager for eight years.
Yet his close relationship with Checketts did not insulate him from
blame.
</P>
<P>
   ``Obviously, I am very disappointed with the news,'' Grunfeld
said in a statement. ``In sports, as in life, things change. Today
it is my turn for change.''
</P>
<P>
   After Checketts arrived at the team's practice facility in
Purchase to discuss the change with the team, Van Gundy declined to
comment on the situation. Van Gundy is expected to remain as coach,
but his job is considered in peril if the Knicks continue to slide.
</P>
<P>
   Behind the scenes, Grunfeld tried to prod Van Gundy into playing
Marcus Camby at the beginning of the season in order to justify the
trade of the popular Charles Oakley and rationalize the $48 million
contract extension he signed Camby to in mid-March. There were also
issues of mistrust after an NBC report March 14 cited sources as
saying that Van Gundy could be fired if he lost to Charlotte that
day. Several members of the organization believed Grunfeld was the
source of that report. And Grunfeld resented the implication.
</P>
<P>
   The tension between Grunfeld and Van Gundy has not been
well-concealed. In an interview Wednesday, Sprewell's agent, Robert
Gist, said the acrimony had disrupted the players. Although he
tempered his comments in comparison to the more strident ones that
were published in Wednesday's New York Post, Gist said he felt
Sprewell was not being utilized to his fullest because of the
politics.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't see any backbone in the leadership there,'' Gist said
Wednesday. ``Guys are looking over their shoulder.
</P>
<P>
   ``When they wanted Latrell, it was a spur-of-the-moment decision
to bring him there. All of a sudden there was a chance to get
Sprewell and they didn't consider where they were going to play
him. They never told him he'd be playing sixth man for them. I
asked Ernie that question specifically a month ago, `Did you say to
him he'd be coming off the bench or that he'd be playing small
forward?' He told me that they would do whatever it takes to win.
Please, spare me the speeches.''
</P>
<P>
   Although Checketts told Grunfeld of his decision to demote him
in a long, emotional dinner Tuesday night, he awoke to Gist's
comments in The Post on Wednesday morning. Just a few days earlier,
Charlie Ward had distributed an article written by Reggie White,
the NFL star who retired this year, that outlined reasons for
banning female reporters from the locker room. Also, the league had
contacted the Knicks about a reported incident of sexual harassment
between Larry Johnson and a team public relations director, Lori
Hamamoto. The culmination of all of the incidents involving players
Grunfeld had assembled, on top of a losing streak that had left the
team at 21-21, presented an image of a team in disarray.
</P>
<P>
   When Checketts arrived to meet with the team Wednesday
afternoon, he pulled Sprewell aside and told him that he held him
accountable for his agent's remarks in The Post. He fined him
$25,000.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I say I'm upset by our record and where we are as an
organization, it's about things like the Larry Johnson situation or
Latrell's agent ripping Jeff and Ernie, I'm not standing for
that,'' said Checketts, who also advised Ward that he was not to
use the locker room as a pulpit for his opinions. ``They say
winning builds character and losing reveals it. Well, as we've
started to lose more than we should, the organization has come
apart a little bit. I'm going to try to step in and see that that
doesn't happen anymore.''
</P>
<P>
   Checketts will take every aspect of the team _ from the way the
talent performs to the way Van Gundy coaches _ under his watch
through the remainder of the season and into the off-season. At
some point, he will decide if Van Gundy's job is safe of not. Van
Gundy would not comment on Grunfeld's demotion Wednesday, but one
team official said that if he survives as coach, he will no doubt
ask for more personnel control.
</P>
<P>
   If Checketts decides to clean the slate and begin anew, he could
pursue Phil Jackson as a coach and general manager. If Van Gundy
remains, Checketts may elect to bring in a general manager to work
with him, someone like former Raptors general manager Isiah Thomas
or Utah's general manger, Scott Layden.
</P>
<P>
   Checketts insisted that his decision to remove Grunfeld from his
position was not an order from ownership. Although there have been
times when Checketts remained patient with the state of his team
during this lockout-shortened season, he said the decision to
demote his long-time friend was his.

<P>
   BRUSSELS, Belgium _ Britain and France are pressing the United
States to seriously consider sending ground forces into Kosovo. But
as leaders of the NATO nations begin gathering in Washington on the
eve of the alliance's 50th anniversary summit, their differences
are so pronounced that the matter has been left off the agenda.
</P>
<P>
   The Clinton administration seems to be extremely wary about
suggestions that ground troops might have to go into Kosovo. One
senior official said he worried about a situation in which NATO
troops found themselves mired in a guerrilla war with Serb
renegades.
</P>
<P>
   ``The problem is not fighting your way in; it is what happens
after you get there,'' the official said.
</P>
<P>
   Nonetheless, Washington signalled some flexibility on Wednesday
night, saying it favored a broad NATO review of options developed
last summer on the use of ground troops in Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   The behind-the-scenes debate broke out into the open this week
in a coordinated series of statements by Britain's prime minister,
defense minister and foreign minister.
</P>
<P>
   With four weeks of bombing attacks already behind them, they
argued that weeks, if not months, of sustained bombing might
sufficiently weaken the Serb military so that NATO ground forces
could move into Kosovo and establish order with limited casualties.
The scenario has been discussed so much in the corridors of NATO
headquarters here that it even has a name: ``a semi-permissive
environment.''
</P>
<P>
   The British proposal would be a major shift from the NATO's
current plan, which is to send in a peacekeeping force of 28,000
troops, but only if President Slobodan Milosevic withdraws his
forces from Kosovo and accepts a peace settlement that allows the
hundreds of thousands of exiled ethnic Albanians to return to their
shattered homes.
</P>
<P>
   As Robin Cook, Britain's foreign minister put it Tuesday in an
address to Parliament, it is possible to ``conceive of
circumstances in which it may be feasible to commit ground
troops.''
</P>
<P>
   The main condition would be the assurance that NATO's force were
not facing ``organized armed resistance.'' As British officials
tell it, Milosevic would not be given a ``veto'' over the
introduction of allied ground troops.
</P>
<P>
   The British are not alone in pressing for the possible
introduction of ground forces. President Jacques Chirac of France
said in a televised speech Wednesday night that the alliance should
apply ``additional means'' besides escalating the air war to stop
``massacres, rapes, burned villages, families separated and thrown
onto the roads.''
</P>
<P>
   French officials said Chirac's statement was an allusion to
ground forces, and that France's plan was to seek a U.N. Security
Council resolution mandating such a force, though such a request
would almost certainly face a Russian veto. President Boris Yeltsin
has objected strenuously to any thought of the West sending in
ground troops.
</P>
<P>
   In Washington, the entire question of ground forces going into
potential combat in Kosovo has been highly sensitive. American
officials have sought to avoid public discussion of the matter.
Defense Secretary William Cohen suggested on Wednesday that the
matter of ground troops did not need to be decided because Gen.
Wesley K. Clark, the NATO commander, had not officially requested
authority to plan a military operation using combat forces.
</P>
<P>
   Left unstated was the fact that NATO's military commander was
not about to propose a major escalation in the fighting unless the
United States, the leader of the alliance, was behind it and was
ready to use its political influence to build support for a
decision to send in ground troops.
</P>
<P>
   But after saying for weeks that no such planning was necessary,
the White House said on Wednesday that it was time to study the
size and composition of the forces that would be needed.
</P>
<P>
   ``The U.S. would certainly support as a prudent measure any
updating of the assessments of the use of ground troops in a
permissive and non-permissive environment,'' the White House
official said on Wednesday evening. ``It would be irresponsible for
us not to periodically update our plans.''
</P>
<P>
   The allies were not the only ones the Clinton administration
appeared to have in mind. Sen. John McCain, R-Ariz., who is seeking
the Republican presidential nomination, has lambasted the Clinton
administration for starting an air campaign against Yugoslavia
without a backup plan for combat troops.
</P>
<P>
   Certainly, all the allies agree the bombing needs to go on for a
long time. Clark has repeatedly argued that the bombing campaign
has to have time to do its work and that it is too early to say if
it will succeed.
</P>
<P>
   On Wednesday night, the 29th day of bombing, allied planes hit
the headquarters of Milosevic's party in Belgrade, a
glass-and-steel 23-story building that also housed three local
television and radio stations.
</P>
<P>
   Defense Minister George Robertson of Britain described the
building as ``one of the nerve centers of the machine which plans
the killing in Kosovo.''
</P>
<P>
   Nonetheless, Western diplomats say Clark has told allied leaders
that he cannot guarantee that bombing attacks alone will compel
Milosevic to withdraw Serbian troops from Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Despite this, NATO nations have yet to ask him to draw up a new
plan to send in combat troops, nor has he asked for the authority
to begin planning.
</P>
<P>
   The review of military options, which the Clinton administration
says it now supports, stops considerably short of that.
</P>
<P>
   Even if there was a plan, lengthy preparations would be needed
to assemble the force. Even then, no ground attack could be carried
out without the approval of the entire 19-member alliance.
</P>
<P>
   In the absence of an agreement, diplomats here initially sought
to paper over their differences. But lately, the British have
insisted that ground troops might be needed to bring the war to an
end.
</P>
<P>
   Toward that end, Prime Minister Tony Blair met with Clinton in
Washington Wednesday night in an apparent effort to persuade him to
do more to actively prepare in case land forces were needed.
</P>
<P>
   Blair made the case for this after meeting at NATO headquarters
with l Clark on Tuesday. He drew a distinction between sending in
ground troops against tough Serb resistance and sending them in
after punishing NATO bombing had taken the fight out of them.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have always made clear the difficulties of putting in
ground forces as a land force invasion against undegraded organized
Serb resistance,'' Blair said. ``We have also equally made it clear
that the international military force is there to allow people to
go back to their homes.''
</P>
<P>
   Going in on the ground would mark a huge departure for NATO,
which has been as preoccupied with maintaining public support at
home for the military campaign as in taking the war to Serb forces.
</P>
<P>
   Chancellor Gerhard Schroder of Germany would probably be in
favor of sending ground troops to Kosovo, but one European official
speculated that Foreign Minister Joschka Fischer's Greens Party
might break apart over the issue, collapsing the government.
</P>
<P>
   Canada would not oppose an alliance consensus, Prime Minister
Jean Chretien said in Montreal on Tuesday. ``If everyone is in
agreement, I will not be the only one disagreeing,'' Chretien said.
</P>
<P>
   The French position is less bold than it seems. French officials
say that France would be prepared to send in troops but only with a
mandate for such a force from the U.N. Security Council, which
would require persuading Russia not to use its veto power there.
</P>
<P>
   That would be a tall order since Moscow is adamantly opposed to
any force that does not have Milosevic's approval.
</P>
<P>
   NATO members will have ample opportunity to debate the issue at
the summit. Their foreign ministers and defense ministers will also
have separate meetings of their own on Friday.
</P>
<P>
   ``The issue of ground troops is not on the agenda in Washington,
but the leaders are certainly going to be talking about it, in
bilateral meetings, over dinner, informally,'' a high European
official of the alliance said.
</P>
<P>
   ``The British, the French and the Turks might all be willing to
go in with ground troops,'' he added. ``Others are more reticent.
But what do the Americans want?''
</P>
<P>
   The Clinton administration has been reluctant to take the lead
in thinking about a land operation.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is an American-led organization,'' the senior European
official said. ``If the Americans said we can't let Milosevic get
away with this, we've got to go in with ground troops, then each
country would have to consider the issue and make a decision. And
we could agree that only the countries that wanted to would
contribute.''

 RACIAL PROFILING IN NEW JERSEY 
</HEADLINE>
  (js) 
 
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The New York Times said in an editorial for Thursday, April 22:
</P>
<P>
   Gov. Christie Whitman and Attorney General Peter Verniero of New
Jersey have belatedly acknowledged that state troopers have
improperly stopped and searched black and Hispanic motorists on the
New Jersey Turnpike because of their race. But both officials
largely avoid broader questions of the state police culture and
leadership. Whitman, who harbors senatorial and national ambitions,
needs to exert a firm hand in demanding true systemic reform before
this issue becomes a turning point in her career. For starters, she
should withdraw her nomination of Verniero to the New Jersey
Supreme Court because of his tardiness in rooting out racial
profiling in the state police, an agency that his office oversees.
</P>
<P>
   Complaints have been voiced for years about New Jersey's use of
race-based traffic stops in trying to make drug arrests. In 1996 a
state judge ruled that troopers had engaged in a ``de facto''
policy of targeting blacks for stops and arrests on the southern
part of the New Jersey Turnpike. But the controversy escalated last
year after state troopers shot three unarmed minority men who were
traveling on the turnpike to a basketball clinic.
</P>
<P>
   Whitman has said that racial profiling is not tolerated by her
administration, but her response to complaints has been muted and
dismissive. Even after she dismissed the state police
superintendent for offensive remarks linking drug trafficking to
specific minority groups, she reiterated her contention that
illegal profiling was not widespread.
</P>
<P>
   Now, after a two-month investigation, an interim report issued
by Verniero this week concedes that the problem of racial profiling
is ``real _ not imagined.'' Some state police have engaged in
``spotlighting,'' or shining their headlights into cars to
determine the race of the driver, and in ``ghosting,'' or
falsification of records to conceal the disproportionate number of
minority motorists stopped.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier evidence showed that 46 percent of those stopped by the
police on a southern stretch of the turnpike were black, even
though only 13.5 percent of the motorists on that stretch were
black. The new report found that although minority drivers made up
less than half the motorists stopped, they represented 77 percent
of those searched.
</P>
<P>
   The attorney general has finally taken some corrective action.
He announced the indictment of two troopers for falsifying the race
of drivers they had stopped in an effort to cover up illegal
targeting of minorities, and he said he would drop the state's
appeal of the adverse 1996 judicial decision.
</P>
<P>
   The Verniero report offers some sound recommendations, notably
an early warning system to help supervisors spot the use of
profiling, detailed reporting of stops and searches, more training
and new guidelines spelling out the criteria to be used in traffic
stops. But reforms of law enforcement tactics will be effective
only if there is equal attention paid to changing attitudes and to
a police culture that has allowed illegal practices to flourish.

GOP SENATORS RALLY TO GIULIANI CANDIDACY 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By ADAM NAGOURNEY   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Facing a possible challenge to his likely bid for
the Republican nomination for the Senate back in New York, Mayor
Rudolph Giuliani came here Wednesday to an orchestrated display of
Republican support by senators who proclaimed Giuliani the
strongest candidate the party could field in the 2000 race.
</P>
<P>
   From a news conference to a dinner with wealthy Republican
donors, Giuliani ate, drank and chatted with Republican senators
who praised his record and in some cases explicitly endorsed him,
as cameras and microphones recorded the scenes.
</P>
<P>
   The three hours of festivities seemed designed to dissuade Rep.
Rick Lazio, a Republican from Long Island who has also expressed an
interest in his party's Senate nomination, from entering the race.
Lazio's possible candidacy does not sit well with many Republicans
who prefer that Giuliani be spared a primary before entering a
contest where his opponent could be Hillary Rodham Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Clinton and Giuliani have both said they are considering
running for the seat being vacated by Daniel Patrick Moynihan, a
Democrat.
</P>
<P>
   Although Lazio is clearly not as well known or as well financed
as Giuliani, a number of Republicans said they believed he could
pose a strong challenge to the mayor in a Republican primary. That
is because he is generally more conservative than Giuliani, comes
from a part of the state which votes heavily in Republican
primaries, and enjoys at least the encouragement _ if not the
explicit support _ of Republican Gov. George Pataki.
</P>
<P>
   The confluence of events Wednesday hinted at the kind of
pressure Lazio could face if he officially enters the race. But in
a caustic statement his office issued even before Giuliani's plane
had landed in Washington Lazio showed no sign of retreating.
</P>
<P>
   ``The people who will elect the next senator of New York are New
Yorkers,'' Lazio said. ``The ultimate judge of a senator is his
ability to legislate. It's not how much press one gets or how well
a person grandstands.''
</P>
<P>
   Giuliani declined to comment on Lazio's remarks.
</P>
<P>
   At Wednesday night's dinner with $10,000 donors to the
Republicans' senate campaign committee, Giuliani drew applause as
he said he would welcome a contest with Mrs. Clinton as a way of
exploring the differences between the two parties on a number of
issues including private school vouchers, which Giuliani supports.
</P>
<P>
   ``If I get the chance to run for the Senate against Hillary
Clinton, you're going to see a very strong division in terms of
philosophy: I will be in favor of people and she will be in favor
of government,'' he said. ``It would be a very, very classic
battle, which I would love to undertake.''
</P>
<P>
   Whatever Giuliani's standing among Republican primary voters in
New York, he clearly appears to be a favorite son here. A committee
of Republicans including Senate Majority Leader Trent Lott and Sen.
Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., head of the National Republican Senatorial
Committee, presided over an afternoon reception for Giuliani that
was attended by about 250 people, many of them lobbyists.
</P>
<P>
   ``No contribution required,'' the invitation said, making it an
unusual political event in Washington, but one which nonetheless
gave the mayor a chance to meet with people who could write him
checks later on.
</P>
<P>
   McConnell, while noting that his committee would not take a
position in a New York race, signaled his own position through his
remarks and by appearing with Giuliani.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have every reason to be enthusiastic about the prospect of
Mayor Giuliani running for the Senate,'' McConnell said. ``He can
win. The surveys clearly indicate that.''
</P>
<P>
   The mayor, who will have to leave City Hall in 2001 because of
term limits, made a similar observation. ``I see this as the
opportunity to have the best chance of having a Republican win in
the state of New York,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Republicans who showed up to see Giuliani praised him as well.
``I think he lives up to the good things I've heard about him,''
said Sen. Strom Thurmond, R-S.C. Thurmond was one of the hosts of
Wednesday's reception, but said he had not endorsed Giuliani
because ``he hasn't asked me.''

JURY SAYS MAN HOSPITALIZED IN CANNIBALISM KILLING CAN GO FREE 
</HEADLINE>
  (jt) 
 By CHARLIE LeDUFF    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   GARDEN CITY, N.Y. _ A Suffolk County jury decided Wednesday that
Albert Fentress, a former school teacher who has spent the last 20
years in psychiatric hospitals after the torture, killing and
cannibalization of a Poughkeepsie teen-ager, no longer presents a
danger to society and should go free.
</P>
<P>
   Fentress, 57, who was found not guilty by reason of insanity in
1980 in the killing of the teen-ager, Paul Masters, was returned
after Wednesday's court proceedings to his room at Pilgrim State
Psychiatric Center in Brentwood, where he will wait while Judge
Harry E. Seidell of State Supreme Court considers a motion by
prosecutors to overturn the jury's decision. Barring that and a
potentially lengthy appeals process, Fentress could be released
into a halfway house with little supervision by this fall.
</P>
<P>
   The jury trial followed Fentress' contest of a decision by state
judges to extend his confinement at Pilgrim State. Such trials are
provided for under New York criminal law, but they are rare, and
state lawyers said they did not believe one had ever been requested
on Long Island. They also said they did not recall a criminally
insane patient ever being released by a jury in the metropolitan
area.
</P>
<P>
   Wednesday's decision shocked many in the criminal justice system
and even drew a response from the governor's mansion.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Fentress case illustrates the glaring need to reform our
state's laws that allow criminals not only to escape conviction and
punishment but to avoid confinement in secure facilities,'' Gov.
George E. Pataki said in a statement.
</P>
<P>
   The Dutchess County district attorney, William V. Grady, whose
office argued that 20 years of therapy had failed to rehabilitate
Fentress, was more blunt.
</P>
<P>
   ``The man is a cannibal,'' Grady said. ``It is an utter outrage
that a killer who is still mentally ill will be released into a
community without supervision to wander about freely. It is beyond
my comprehension.''
</P>
<P>
   Paul Masters, an 18-year-old high school student, was killed on
a Sunday evening in August 1979 after wandering into Fentress'
backyard. Fentress, then a middle-school teacher, admitted that
with scenes from the movie ``Deliverance'' playing in his head, he
lured the teen-ager into his basement, tied him to a post, sexually
abused and mutilated him, shot him twice in the head, and cooked
and ate parts of his body.
</P>
<P>
   Fentress wrote a script for a torture and killing two days
before, but was mortified by his own thoughts and burned it.
</P>
<P>
   But during the recent trial, Fentress' lawyer, Kim L. Darrow,
did not ask him about the events of that August evening, so lawyers
for the state were not allowed to bring it up on cross examination.
Fentress had confessed to the crime the day it happened, but was
not required to testify in court because prosecutors had accepted
his insanity plea.
</P>
<P>
   Taken out of the courthouse in Riverhead without handcuffs
Wednesday, Fentress, dressed in tan slacks, a blazer and a dark
blue tie, stopped for a moment and cleared his throat. ``I am right
now just so grateful to the jury and judge,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Darrow, of the state's Mental Hygiene Legal Service, called the
verdict a victory not only for his client but for the hundreds of
other patients who float for years in a limbo between not-guilty
and not-free.
</P>
<P>
   ``In some ways it's a cruel and unusual law,'' he said. ``It
holds out the promise that if a patient follows the plan, the
rules, the treatment, some time your day may come,'' he said.
``Once he's not dangerous, he's supposed to be let go. I think he's
been ready for a long time,'' Darrow said.
</P>
<P>
   After deliberating for more than six hours over two days, the
six-person jury came back with the answers to two questions posed
by the court: Is the petitioner, Albert Fentress, presently
suffering from mental illness, where he requires care, treatment
and rehabilitation?
</P>
<P>
   The jury answered yes, by a vote of 6-to-0.
</P>
<P>
   Does Albert Fentress require inpatient care and treatment due to
a real risk of substantial physical harm to his well being or
others?
</P>
<P>
   The jury answered no by a vote of 5-to-1.
</P>
<P>
   In effect, the jury decided that Fentress is still mentally ill,
but not so ill that he still must be committed, Darrow said.

SICK-LOOKING ROBBER HITS L.A. BANKS LIKE PLAGUE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
BY GREG GITTRICH  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES -- An emaciated, pockmarked bank robber, dubbed
``the down-and-out bandit'' by federal agents, is on the loose in
Los Angeles and has held up 11 banks since January, FBI officials
said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   ``He seems to be getting thinner and sicker-looking with each
robbery,'' said Robert J. Mack, supervisory special agent of the
FBI's Los Angeles Bank Robbery Squad.
</P>
<P>
   The gunman has open sores or scabs on his arms and an ``orange
complexion,'' and he is ``just sickly looking'' and cadaverlike,
Mack said, referring to witness reports.
</P>
<P>
   Mack described the bandit as a balding, white male, 50 to 60
years old, 5 feet 5 inches to 5 feet 8 inches tall. Investigators
believe he may be an outpatient at a local hospital and could be
suffering from AIDS or cancer.
</P>
<P>
   Wielding a 9 mm semiautomatic handgun, the bandit began his
string of holdups Jan. 2 at a Bank of America on West Beverly
Boulevard in Beverly Hills, Mack said.
</P>
<P>
   During the last four months, he has robbed two banks in Beverly
Hills, three in Brentwood, four in Los Angeles and one in Malibu,
Mack said. Federal agents would not disclose the total amount of
money stolen during the string of heists.
</P>
<P>
   Robbing six banks this month alone, he struck twice on Tuesday
-- at a City National Bank and a Marathon National Bank, both
located on West Olympic Boulevard in West Los Angeles, federal
agents said.
</P>
<P>
   The bandit typically approaches a bank teller, brandishes a
handgun and gives the employee a note demanding $100 and $50 bills,
Mack said.
</P>
<P>
   Investigators suspect the bandit also carjacked a late-model,
four-door Mercedes 190 on West Pico Boulevard in Los Angeles last
week.
</P>
<P>
   ``He told them he had a gun and needed the car because someone
was very sick and he needed to get them to a hospital,'' Mack said.
``He promised to return the car in an hour.''
</P>
<P>
   The bandit never returned the car. He showed up hours later in
Malibu, where he robbed a Bank of America on the 23700 block of
West Malibu Boulevard, federal agents said.
</P>
<P>
   No one has been injured in any of the incidents, but Mack
stressed that the bandit is armed and has been acting desperate
lately.

POLICE REMOVE 15 BODIES FROM SCHOOL SHOOTING SCENE

<P>
   LITTLETON, Colo. _ After a gut-wrenching, room-by-room search by
bomb experts and crime investigators, the bodies of 14 teens and
one adult were finally removed from blood-spattered Columbine High
School late Wednesday, scene of the worst school shooting in
Colorado history.
</P>
<P>
   Among the 15 dead were the two gunmen, identified as senior-year
students, who attacked faculty and fellow students Tuesday with
bombs and gunfire before killing themselves in a second floor
library.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was devastating. I've been a cop for 27 years and a SWAT
officer for 11 years and this was clearly the most devastating and
traumatic scene I have ever seen,'' said Sgt. George Hinkle of the
Lakeside Police SWAT team, among 100 officers called to the
shooting.
</P>
<P>
   The victims included a computer teacher who coached the girl's
basketball team, 10 male students and four female students. Family
members had endured a nearly 24-hour wait before they were told
whose bodies were lying inside. Authorities withheld names
Wednesday although some families confirmed some victims.
</P>
<P>
   The gunmen, who began the rampage at about 11:30 a.m., killed
two students in the parking lot. The two, wearing black trench
coats and masks, detonated handmade bombs and shot students at
point-blank range with shotguns and semiautomatic rifles as they
roamed the school for several hours. Many students were trapped
inside as the ordeal unfolded.
</P>
<P>
   The gunmen were identified Wednesday as Eric David Harris, 18,
and Dylan Bennet Klebold, 17, seniors who belonged to a social
group calling themselves the ``Trenchcoat Mafia.'' Other students
said the two collected guns, disliked athletes and minorities and
appeared infatuated with Nazi lore. Officials said Wednesday they
had no evidence minorities were specifically targeted.
</P>
<P>
   The parents of the two gunmen, in statements issued by their
lawyers, expressed regret to the victims' families and the
community and said they were struggling as well to understand what
happened.
</P>
<P>
   The gunmen kept SWAT officers at bay until almost 4 p.m. while
many of the school's 2,000 students hid under desks, in closets and
classrooms.
</P>
<P>
   Officials said Wednesday that 16 of the 23 wounded remained in
seven area hospitals.
</P>
<P>
   Although investigators believe Harris and Klebold acted alone
inside the school, investigators were questioning about eight to 10
fellow members of the ``Trenchcoat Mafia.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I think there was some evidence to suggest that there were
some other people that were aware. I think we have to pursue
vigorously, at least for the time being, that there were other
people involved in the planning,'' said District Attorney David J.
Thomas of the First Judicial District.
</P>
<P>
   Inside the school and in automobiles in the parking lot
authorities found 30 home-made explosive devices, including Molotov
cocktail-type bombs with matches as fuses and two-foot-long propane
tanks wrapped with nails and attached to pipe bombs. More
bomb-making materials were found in searches of the gunmen's homes.
</P>
<P>
   Jefferson County Sheriff John P. Stone said some of the bombs
were built with timers and designed to spray nails and shrapnel. He
said investigators had not determined if some of the bombs had been
hidden in the school before Tuesday's rampage or how the two
carried their arsenal into the school without being detected.
Witnesses said the two carried duffel bags.
</P>
<P>
   ``This was not something that was done overnight,'' Stone said.
``There was a lot of time planning this sort of thing.''
</P>
<P>
   Investigators also seized a sawed-off shotgun and a computer
from the home of one of the gunmen. Stone would not describe the
material found to make the bombs, but said the items were commonly
available.
</P>
<P>
   Stone said eight or nine semi-automatic magazines were found in
the school along with numerous spent shotgun shells. The bodies of
Harris and Klebold were found within a few feet of each other with
undetonated bombs nearby. A 9 mm semiautomatic rifle, two shotguns
with their stocks sawed off and a semiautomatic pistol were at
their sides.
</P>
<P>
   The bodies of the gunmen were in the library where most of the
carnage took place. Of the 13 victims killed, including Dave
Sanders, the coach, 10 were in the library. The body of the coach
was found in a closet near the library.
</P>
<P>
   Steve Davis, Jefferson County Sheriff's spokesman, said the
investigators were unable to begin the grisly task of examining the
crime scene until after bomb experts swept through the school and
surrounding area searching for undetonated bombs.
</P>
<P>
   One problem was the hundreds of backpacks left behind as
students fled the school.
</P>
<P>
   Davis said SWAT officers from various police departments were
inside the school within 20 minutes of a report of the shooting,
but were hampered by a lack of information about the assailants or
their numbers. About 15 minutes before the shooting began, he said,
a bomb was exploded away from the campus as a diversion.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had 2,000 students in there and no way to identify who the
suspects were,'' Davis said.
</P>
<P>
   Davis said three deputies _ exchanged gunfire with the suspects,
including deputy Neil Gardner, assigned as security at the school,
who remained inside during the ordeal. The other two deputies,
Deputy Paul Smoker and Lt. Terry Manwaring, exchanged gunfire with
one of the suspects when he appeared on the roof of the school.
</P>
<P>
   Hinkle said his officers had little information to act on by the
time they arrived at the scene at 12:46 p.m. Upon arriving, he said
his officers first spotted a sign in a window that read, ``Help,
I'm bleeding to death.''
</P>
<P>
   He said a student was holding his arms out of the window of the
second-story library and that the boy was rescued when an armored
car pulled underneath the window and two SWAT officers grabbed the
boy out of the window.
</P>
<P>
   Hinckle said he was unprepared for what he saw when he came upon
the crime scene. He said students and teachers were coming out of
closets, under desks and classrooms as officers made their way
through the school's halls. Officers found students calling for
help on cellular phones or using computers.
</P>
<P>
   Other officers described it as a scene from Dante's Inferno.
</P>
<P>
   Hinkle said he found two areas where propane bombs had been
detonated and the cafeteria floor was under four inches of water
from the school's indoor fire sprinkler system.
</P>
<P>
   ``When we train, we train for EDPs, (emotionally disturbed
people) and it is so rare to have multiple EDP suspects,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Hundreds of students and supporters gathered at a media staging
area at a nearby park to leave flowers and notes for the victims.
</P>
<P>
   Other students held a vigil at a red Acura car belonging to
Rachel Scott, a junior at the school and one of the victims in the
rampage, crying as they leaned on the car hood draped with flowers.
</P>
<P>
   Among them was Jessica Cave, a 16-year-old sophomore who hid in
a small science storage room with 25 to 30 other students for three
hours. The room was at the end of a stairway leading to the
cafeteria on the first floor.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was right on the other side of the wall,'' she said of the
gunfire erupting in the hallway.
</P>
<P>
   She said the students, standing shoulder to shoulder, remained
quiet with a teacher standing at the door using her body as a
barricade until they heard SWAT officers in the hall.
</P>
<P>
   Eric Viek, a senior who shared a video production class last
semester with the two suspects, said he gave police three videos he
had made with Harris and Kebold that he described as action-type
movies, but declined to give specifics about their content or
message.
</P>
<P>
   ``In their videos they were always in their trenchcoats. They
always wanted to be the intimidators. They always wanted to be the
good guys going after the bad guys. They wanted to be the heroes.''
</P>
<P>
   He said the two were loners who liked to listen to German music.
He said they would joke about planning a prank for the Class of
1999 and mentioned that Adolf Hitler's birthday was coming in a few
months. The attack happened on the birthday.
</P>
<P>
   He said he never thought about their plans as more than a
harmless prank.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am shocked at what they did yesterday. I did not think they
would do what they did yesterday,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Down here in the suburbs where things are a little quieter
there aren't too many people who want to stand out. They wanted to
stand out.''
</P>
<P>
   School officials said all schools in the Jefferson County Public
School system would reopen today, except Columbine. School
spokesman Rick Kaufman said all the schools were swept for
explosives and that security will be beefed at the entrances of
schools in the district, the largest in Colorado with 140 schools
and 89,000 students.
</P>
<P>
   Michelle DiManna, a math teacher and a 1989 graduate of
Columbine, said returning will be difficult.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just can't imagine going into my classroom and seeing the
missing seats,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's unnerving in some ways. I really want to go back there,
but in some ways, emotionally I don't want to go back there. The
innocence of Columbine High School is gone,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   She said she remembers the prom assembly last Friday when
Principal Frank DeAngelis reminded students to be careful on prom
night and talked about the students killed in accidents in previous
years.
</P>
<P>
   ``He didn't want to put another memorial on the wall at
Columbine,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Nick Baumgart, a 17-year-old senior who was in Klebold's Boy
Scout troop, said the tragedy extends beyond the loss of lives and
will be carried among the living at Columbine.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't want my last day of high school to be that day. It
will be hard but I don't want that to be the last day,'' he said.

MAKING BOOKS: TIDBITS THAT SURVIVED EDITING  
</HEADLINE>
  (js) 
 By MARTIN ARNOLD   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The hum in publishing is a book about itself, written by Michael
Korda, who is editor in chief at Simon &AMP; Schuster and with this
book is also sort of the minstrel of the business. At any rate the
anecdotes of his publishing reminiscence, amusing, often wry and
exhilaratingly frank, are being talked about and laughed over
wherever those in the industry gather and someone in the crowd has
actually read the page proofs and is sharing favorite stories.
</P>
<P>
   In recent years a few publishers, editors and agents have become
celebrities similar to, although not quite as excitably visible as,
some famous writers and movie and television executives. So with
the strong word of mouth that this book is getting, the hope by its
publisher is that it will not only interest the natives of the
publishing community but will also have the crossover appeal that
some movie-mogul memoirs do.
</P>
<P>
   The book is ``Another Life: A Memoir of Other People,'' a title
that is precisely accurate if not exactly succulent or stirring.
Its publisher, Random House, has a first printing of 40,000 copies,
which shows considerable faith that the fun of the book and the
publicity it will get will carry it beyond the slender confines of
the industry it covers. The book is scheduled to be in stores next
week.
</P>
<P>
   There have been other books about the incestuous world of
publishing, but none as informative with serious stuff and at the
same time as insouciant as Korda's. The most prominent previous
publishing memoir probably was ``At Random: The Reminiscences of
Bennett Cerf'' (Random House, 1977), which was constructed after
Cerf's death from an oral history in which he had participated and
from his diaries and scrapbooks.
</P>
<P>
   Cerf, a founder of Random House and a true publishing innovator,
was perhaps the first celebrity publisher, having been at the same
time a television game-show panelist. His book was a bland but
charming collection of froth.
</P>
<P>
   This look at publishing was followed in 1991 by Charles Scribner
Jr.'s ``In the Company of Writers: A Life in Publishing''
(Scribner), which was also based on an oral history and was much
meatier and more strapping than Cerf's book. Two years later
Scribner published his second book, ``In the Web of Ideas: The
Education of a Publisher.''
</P>
<P>
   That's about it. There are fewer objective histories of book
publishing than there are of television, which by comparison is in
its infancy. Korda's book is subjective in that he is the glue that
binds the chain of tales together, and he is often at the core of
an anecdote. But essentially Korda is telling his own story through
his experiences with others, which is what the book's title is
about. Thus, we meet writers like Jacqueline Susann (a forthcoming
movie about her is based on one of several pieces from Korda's book
that appeared in The New Yorker), Harold Robbins, Graham Greene and
Tennessee Williams. Korda is a legendry editor, having been at
Simon &AMP; Schuster for 40 years, and an editor who the publisher of
his latest book, Ann Godoff, said ``could edit a novel on the
telephone.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Another Life'' was edited by another celebrated editor, Robert
Loomis, and thus it's not surprising that he writes, too, about
other storied publishing executives, including Robert Gottlieb, the
publisher Richard Snyder, Cerf and Max Schuster, a founder of the
house that bears his name.
</P>
<P>
   There is a gleeful, sometimes acid bite to many of Korda's
stories, although he said that ``the last thing I wanted to write
was a mean-spirited book.'' Schuster, for instance, is reported as
being so shy and befuddled that when he was middle-aged and went to
ask a widow for permission to marry her daughter, the woman thought
he was proposing to her. She accepted, and Schuster married the
wrong woman. Of Snyder, for whom he worked and who remains one of
Korda's best friends, Korda wrote that ``one guessed, too, that his
bark and his bite were likely to be equally unpleasant.''
</P>
<P>
   Susann told Korda that ``you're a big-shot editor, but you dress
like a bum.'' She then turned to her husband and manager, Irving
Mansfields, and ordered, ``Give him your blazer, honey.'' The
cashmere blazer had just arrived from the tailor, had 18-karat gold
buttons and sleeves as long as a chimpanzee's arms. Mansfields
couldn't bear to part with it, but the author was not to be
contradicted. ``Bunching the material up behind my back,'' Korda
writes, Susann said: ``It fits fine. It looks great on you, doll.''
Mansfields had tears in his eyes, but gave up the jacket.
</P>
<P>
   As Korda said in an interview, ``people should read my book and
giggle and laugh.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Still, this is a serious book, and on one level it is an
objective history of book publishing, even if Korda often uses
himself as the jar around which he weaves the industry's
wilderness.
</P>
<P>
   Book publishing was always a restricted industry, ``a bit like
entering a rather stuffy and self-important club,'' he writes,
adding that one who entered it had ``the satisfaction of being
among well-educated gentlemen of your own persuasion, pursuing an
old, even noble profession.'' It wasn't until the late 1920s and
the 1930s that there was more than one publishing house owned by
Jews, for instance. Then came major houses like Simon &AMP; Schuster,
Random House and Alfred A. Knopf, all founded by Jews who, Korda
writes, were serious businessmen but ``thought that publishing
ought to be fun.''
</P>
<P>
   The welding together of pieces of the industry into large
multinational companies could be, but certainly ``isn't necessarily
a bad thing,'' he said in an interview. ``If you buy Knopf, why
would you change it if you bought it because you liked it?''
</P>
<P>
   He said: ``There is somehow a personality that a house had from
the beginning that was replicated by every generation even if the
people there didn't know how it got there. Younger people get it.
There's a certain look to a Knopf book that's unchanged since 1948
or 1958.''
</P>
<P>
   ``When I go to Random House it's different than Simon &AMP; Schuster
in exactly the way it was different in 1958,'' he continued, adding
that Random House was ``always more manicured, less messy, less
cartons in the halls, freshly painted. The amazing thing about S &AMP;
S is that despite being bought and rebought and resold and being
processed into smaller parts from a larger entity, the spirit of
the place is the same, and was set by its founders. Now I get it. I
realize it's the way it is because that's the way it's always
been.''
</P>
<P>
   Edgar Allan Poe once famously wrote that, ``K--, the publisher,
trying to be critical, talks about books pretty much as a
washerwoman would about Niagara Falls or a poulterer about a
phoenix.''
</P>
<P>
   That's not Korda, who is a publishing romantic and, like many
romantics, has a lusty ego. Wednesday he called and said of his
book, ``I just reread it, and I giggled.''
