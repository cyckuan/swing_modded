AUDIT FINDS THAT COUNTIES' MONEY HANDLING KEEPS WOMEN OUT OF
DOMESTIC VIOLENCE SHELTERS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MATT STEARNS  
 c. 2000 Kansas City Star   Thousands of Missouri women were turned
away from domestic violence shelters because many counties didn't
collect or didn't spend money earmarked for shelters, according to
a state audit released Monday.
<TEXT>
<P>
   More than 5,000 women and children were refused shelter in 1998
because the shelters were full, said Claire McCaskill, state
auditor.
</P>
<P>
   There were more than 43,000 reported cases of domestic violence
in Missouri in 1998, according to the Missouri Highway Patrol.
</P>
<P>
   Counties collect and disburse many funds for domestic shelters.
State law allows counties to collect as many as three different
fees to help fund shelters and requires counties to collect a $5
fee on marriage licenses.
</P>
<P>
   In 1998, such fees accounted for about 5 percent of funding for
domestic violence shelters.
</P>
<P>
   But, the audit found, more than half the counties in Missouri
did not impose the three optional fees. Others collect money but
don't disburse all of it. Some collect money but place it in the
wrong accounts.
</P>
<P>
   While audits don't carry the force of law, they are tools for
prompting changes in public policy. In this case, those changes
could come on several fronts: Counties could change collection and
spending practices, for example, or legislators could change state
laws to require fee collections.
</P>
<P>
   McCaskill's audit found that in 1998, about $1.2 million was
collected for shelters through such fees. If all Missouri counties
collected all the fees, the total amount could increase by
$902,000.
</P>
<P>
   Statewide, almost $500,000 in fee collections remained
undisbursed in 1998.
</P>
<P>
   Most of that was in St. Louis, which kept more than $300,000,
the audit found. More than 1,300 people were turned away from full
shelters in St. Louis that year.
</P>
<P>
   St. Louis authorities did not explain to auditors why the money
had not been disbursed. Sylvia Jackson, program manager for
shelters in St. Louis, could not be reached for comment.
</P>
<P>
   Some smaller counties kept money they collected because there
had been no requests for it or because there were no shelters in
the county.
</P>
<P>
   Jackson County, where Kansas City is located, spent all of its
money. More than 3,000 women and children, however, were turned
away, the audit found.
</P>
<P>
   More money could have been raised through a state program that
gives tax credits to businesses and people that donate money to
shelters.
</P>
<P>
   Over a three-year period, that program resulted in only $1.5
million out of a possible $12 million in donations.
</P>
<P>
   The program needs to be publicized better to be more effective,
McCaskill said.
</P>
<P>
   The human cost of underfunded shelters is enormous, she added.
</P>
<P>
   ``The point in time when women are in the most danger is when
they separate'' from their abusers, McCaskill said. ``That's when
they need a safe place.''
</P>
<P>
   Susan Miller, executive director of the Rose Brooks Center, a
50-bed domestic violence shelter in Kansas City, said the
availability of a shelter was key in helping women permanently
leave abusers.
</P>
<P>
   ``If she has a safe place to go, she's much more likely to break
the cycle and not go back to her abuser again,'' Miller said.
</P>
<P>
   To maximize funding and to help more victims of domestic
violence, a state agency should centralize the collection and
disbursement of money for shelters, McCaskill said.
</P>
<P>
   The state Department of Public Safety would be the best agency
to take over such a function, McCaskill said. It already
administers millions of dollars in state and federal grants for
domestic violence shelters.
</P>
<P>
   Centralizing the collection and allocation of money would solve
several problems, said Tom Brooks, spokesman for the Missouri
Coalition Against Domestic Violence, which requested the audit.
</P>
<P>
   A centralized agency could market the state tax credit program
better, Brooks said.
</P>
<P>
   And money not disbursed by individual counties would be paid out
to areas that need more funding.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's no reason for counties to be hoarding this money where
there's no expectation that a shelter will ever be built,'' Brooks
said. ``It's collected for a specific purpose. If you don't have
anywhere to spend it, it ought to be spent somewhere. It's not
serving anyone sitting in a bank account.''
</P>
<P>
   Several other states already centralize fee collection and
distribution, McCaskill said.
</P>
<P>
   But political realities might prevent such a system in Missouri,
said Rep. Vicky Riback Wilson, a Columbia Democrat who sponsored
domestic violence legislation last year.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would think the majority of communities would want to keep
local control of their funds,'' Wilson said. ``I think that
suggestion is going to need a lot more scrutiny and debate. We have
to find a way to maintain local control over funds in each county
to at least ensure that funds are being distributed equitably.''

   The New York Times is publishing the following editors' note in
all editions of Tuesday, Sept. 26. If you published stories from
The New York Times News Service over the past several months
concerning the case of Wen Ho Lee or the security problems at the
Los Alamos National Laboratory, you may wish to publish this note
as well.
</P>
<P>
   From The Editors
</P>
<P>
   The New York Times and Wen Ho Lee
</P>
<P>
   On March 6, 1999, The New York Times reported that Government
investigators believed China had accelerated its nuclear weapons
program with the aid of stolen American secrets. The article said
the Federal Bureau of Investigation had focused its suspicions on a
Chinese-American scientist at the Los Alamos National Laboratory.
Two days later, the government announced that it had fired a Los
Alamos scientist for ``serious security violations.'' Officials
identified the man as Wen Ho Lee.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Lee was indicted nine months later on charges that he had
transferred huge amounts of restricted information to an easily
accessible computer. Justice Department prosecutors persuaded a
judge to hold him in solitary confinement without bail, saying his
release would pose a grave threat to the nuclear balance.
</P>
<P>
   This month the Justice Department settled for a guilty plea to a
single count of mishandling secret information. The judge accused
prosecutors of having misled him on the national security threat
and having provided inaccurate testimony. Dr. Lee was released on
the condition that he cooperate with the authorities to explain why
he downloaded the weapons data and what he did with it.
</P>
<P>
   The Times's coverage of this case, especially the articles
published in the first few months, attracted criticism from
competing journalists and media critics and from defenders of Dr.
Lee, who contended that our reporting had stimulated a political
frenzy amounting to a witch hunt. After Dr. Lee's release, the
White House, too, blamed the pressure of coverage in the media, and
specifically The Times, for having propelled an overzealous
prosecution by the administration's own Justice Department.
</P>
<P>
   As a rule, we prefer to let our reporting speak for itself. In
this extraordinary case, the outcome of the prosecution and the
accusations leveled at this newspaper may have left many readers
with questions about our coverage. That confusion _ and the stakes
involved, a man's liberty and reputation _ convince us that a
public accounting is warranted.
</P>
<P>
   In the days since the prosecution ended, the paper has looked
back at the coverage. On the whole, we remain proud of work that
brought into the open a major national security problem of which
officials had been aware for months, even years. Our review found
careful reporting that included extensive cross-checking and
vetting of multiple sources, despite enormous obstacles of official
secrecy and government efforts to identify The Times's sources. We
found articles that accurately portrayed a debate behind the scenes
on the extent and importance of Chinese espionage _ a debate that
now, a year and a half later, is still going on. We found clear,
precise explanations of complex science.
</P>
<P>
   But looking back, we also found some things we wish we had done
differently in the course of the coverage to give Dr. Lee the full
benefit of the doubt. In those months, we could have pushed harder
to uncover weaknesses in the F.B.I. case against Dr. Lee. Our
coverage would have been strengthened had we moved faster to assess
the scientific, technical and investigative assumptions that led
the F.B.I. and the Department of Energy to connect Dr. Lee to what
is still widely acknowledged to have been a major security breach.
</P>
<P>
   The Times neither imagined the security breach nor initiated the
case against Wen Ho Lee. By the time our March 6 article appeared,
F.B.I. agents had been looking closely into Dr. Lee's activities
for more than three years. A bipartisan congressional committee had
already conducted closed hearings and written a secret report
unanimously concluding that Chinese nuclear espionage had harmed
American national security, and questioning the administration's
vigilance. The White House had been briefed repeatedly on these
issues, and the secretary of energy had begun prodding the F.B.I.
Dr. Lee had already taken a lie detector test; F.B.I. investigators
believed that it showed deception when he was asked whether he had
leaked secrets.
</P>
<P>
   The Times's stories _ echoed and often oversimplified by
politicians and other news organizations _ touched off a fierce
public debate. At a time when the Clinton administration was
defending a policy of increased engagement with China, any
suggestion that the White House had not moved swiftly against a
major Chinese espionage operation was politically explosive.
</P>
<P>
   But the investigative and political forces were converging on
Dr. Lee long before The Times began looking into this story.
</P>
<P>
   The assertion in our March 6 article that the Chinese made a
surprising leap in the miniaturization of nuclear weapons remains
unchallenged. That concern had previously been reported in The Wall
Street Journal, but without the details provided by The Times in a
painstaking narrative that showed how various agencies and the
White House itself had responded to the reported security breach.
</P>
<P>
   The prevailing view within the government is still that China
made its gains with access to valuable information about American
nuclear weaponry, although the extent to which this espionage
helped China is disputed. And while the circle of suspicion has
widened greatly, Los Alamos has not been ruled out as the source of
the leak.
</P>
<P>
   The article, however, had flaws that are more apparent now that
the weaknesses of the F.B.I. case against Dr. Lee have surfaced. It
did not pay enough attention to the possibility that there had been
a major intelligence loss in which the Los Alamos scientist was a
minor player, or completely uninvolved.
</P>
<P>
   The Times should have moved more quickly to open a second line
of reporting, particularly among scientists inside and outside the
government. The paper did this in the early summer, and published a
comprehensive article on Sept. 7, 1999. The article laid out even
more extensively the evidence that Chinese espionage had secured
the key design elements of an American warhead called the W-88
while showing at the same time that this secret material was
available not only at Los Alamos but ``to hundreds and perhaps
thousands of individuals scattered throughout the nation's arms
complex.''
</P>
<P>
   That article, which helped put the charges against Dr. Lee in a
new perspective, appeared a full three months before the scientist
was indicted.
</P>
<P>
   Early on, our reporting turned up cautions that might have led
us to that perspective sooner. For example, the March 6 article
noted, deep in the text, that the Justice Department prosecutors
did not think they had enough evidence against the Los Alamos
scientist to justify a wiretap on his telephone. At the time, the
Justice Department refused to discuss its decision, but the fact
that the evidence available to the F.B.I. could not overcome the
relatively permissive standards for a wiretap in a case of such
potential gravity should have been more prominent in the article
and in our thinking.
</P>
<P>
   Passages of some articles also posed a problem of tone. In place
of a tone of journalistic detachment from our sources, we
occasionally used language that adopted the sense of alarm that was
contained in official reports and was being voiced to us by
investigators, members of Congress and administration officials
with knowledge of the case.
</P>
<P>
   This happened even in an otherwise far-seeing article on June
14, 1999, that laid out _ a half year before the indictment _ the
reasons the Justice Department might never be able to prove that
Dr. Lee had spied for China. The article said Dr. Lee ``may be
responsible for the most damaging espionage of the post-cold war
era.'' Though it accurately attributed this characterization to
``officials and lawmakers, primarily Republicans,'' such remarks
should have been, at a minimum, balanced with the more skeptical
views of those who had doubts about the charges against Dr. Lee.
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, far from stimulating a witch hunt, The Times had
clearly shown before Dr. Lee was even charged that the case against
him was circumstantial and therefore weak, and that there were
numerous other potential sources for the design of the warhead.
</P>
<P>
   There are articles we should have assigned but did not. We never
prepared a full-scale profile of Dr. Lee, which might have
humanized him and provided some balance.
</P>
<P>
   Some other stories we wish we had assigned in those early months
include a more thorough look at the political context of the
Chinese weapons debate, in which Republicans were eager to score
points against the White House on China; an examination of how Dr.
Lee's handling of classified information compared with the usual
practices in the laboratories; a closer look at Notra Trulock, the
intelligence official at the Department of Energy who sounded some
of the loudest alarms about Chinese espionage; and an exploration
of the various suspects and leads that federal investigators passed
up in favor of Dr. Lee.
</P>
<P>
   In those instances where we fell short of our standards in our
coverage of this story, the blame lies principally with those who
directed the coverage, for not raising questions that occurred to
us only later. Nothing in this experience undermines our faith in
any of our reporters, who remained persistent and fair-minded in
their newsgathering in the face of some fierce attacks.
</P>
<P>
   An enormous amount remains unknown or disputed about the case of
Dr. Lee and the larger issue of Chinese espionage, including why
the scientist transferred classified computer code to an easily
accessible computer and then tried to hide the fact (a development
first reported in The Times), and how the government case evolved.
Even the best investigative reporting is performed under deadline
pressure, with the best assessment of information available at the
time. We have dispatched a team of reporters, including the
reporters who broke our first stories, to go back to the beginning
of these controversies and do more reporting, drawing on sources
and documents that were not previously available. Our coverage of
this case is not over.

TEAGUE, WOODSON EXPECT MORE REPERCUSSIONS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By CLARENCE E. HILL JR. 
c.2000 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   IRVING, Texas _ A day after the game, the post-touchdown
taunting by San Francisco 49ers receiver Terrell Owens and the
response by Dallas Cowboys safety George Teague was still on
everybody's mind.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe that's what happens when there's nothing good on the
football field to talk about. Both teams are 1-3.
</P>
<P>
   The 49ers ``suspended'' Owens for a week and fined him a game
check worth $24,294. Owens has been excused from practice and
Sunday's game against the Arizona Cardinals.
</P>
<P>
   Teague was ejected from the game after tackling Owens in an
attempt to prevent him from celebrating a second touchdown on the
blue star at midfield at Texas Stadium. He is anticipating a fine
from the NFL. So is safety Darren Woodson, who was ejected in the
fourth quarter for arguing with the officials.
</P>
<P>
   Both players could also be fined by the Cowboys for leaving the
locker room before the game was over. Cowboys coach Dave Campo said
he was disappointed that Teague and Woodson didn't wait for the
team and listen to his postgame speech.
</P>
<P>
   A decision on whether the players will be fined will come this
week, he said.
</P>
<P>
   On Monday, Teague said that he was wrong for tackling Owens. But
he said he has no regrets.
</P>
<P>
   He also acknowledged that his frustration was a result of the
Cowboys' poor play and that Owens' showboating was just a ``double
whammy'' to his psyche.
</P>
<P>
   Campo said he doesn't condone fighting, but he didn't deny
supporting Teague's response.
</P>
<P>
   Campo, however, said he wants the Cowboys to fight for wins
rather than fighting out of frustration when they are losing.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is no room in the game for that,'' Campo said. AIKMAN
AND BOOS
</P>
<P>
   Quarterback Troy Aikman said Monday he isn't bitter about being
booed by fans at Texas Stadium during Sunday's 41-24 loss to the
49ers.
</P>
<P>
   Aikman said that kind of treatment comes with the job of being
the quarterback. And fans, he said, have the right to be upset with
his and the team's performance.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm sure I'd be upset if I was them, too, after some of the
performances we have had as a team,'' Aikman said. ``They felt I
contributed to that, and I certainly do. I tend not to dwell on
(the boos). I just try to do better.''
</P>
<P>
   When asked if he was disappointed that Cowboys fans have turned
against him after the success he has had, Aikman again sided with
the fans' perspective.
</P>
<P>
   ``Right now, we are a team that's 1-3,'' Aikman said. ``It
doesn't matter what I've accomplished or what this football team
has accomplished in the past.'' EKUBAN SIDELINED BY TOE INJURY
</P>
<P>
   Defensive end Ebenezer Ekuban will miss Sunday's game against
the Panthers after dislocating a toe against the 49ers.
</P>
<P>
   The Cowboys have a bye the following Sunday, so Ekuban could be
back for the Oct. 15 matchup against the New York Giants.
</P>
<P>
   Other injuries from Sunday were not deemed serious. Receiver
Raghib Ismail (ankle), defensive tackle Leon Lett (hamstring) and
center Mark Stepnoski (hamstring) are listed as day-to-day.
</P>
<P>
   Receiver Wane McGarity, who sat out the game because of a
sprained ankle, could return to practice this week. However, the
Cowboys are being cautious, listing him as doubtful for the
Carolina game.
</P>
<P>
   Linebacker Dat Nguyen, who missed the past two games with a
sprained knee, has been upgraded to questionable for the Carolina
game. Nguyen said he won't know if he'll be able to play until
Wednesday after practice.
</P>
<P>
   Cornerback Charlie Williams, who has been out since the
beginning of training camp after a staph infection complicated his
recovery from knee surgery, is also listed as questionable.
</P>
<P>
   Williams passed a physical Friday and will return to practice
this week. However, he likely will be held out until after the bye
for conditioning reasons. nn

AIKMAN AN EASY TARGET FOR OBNOXIOUS FANS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JIM REEVES 
c.2000 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   At heart, you're a coward.
</P>
<P>
   You hide behind your anonymity in a crowd, hundreds of feet from
where the real action is, and show your mettle by booing your lungs
out. What courage that must take.
</P>
<P>
   You know exactly who you are and so do we. Maybe not personally,
but we know the kind of person you are. We know how obnoxious you
can be. We know how bad you make everyone around you feel.
</P>
<P>
   You're the worst part of us, and maybe that's why we feel so
ashamed. There's a little bit of you in almost all of us. It's the
part we try to scrub away in the shower every day.
</P>
<P>
   By the way, who dresses you anyway? You stand there, holding up
your ``Bench Ache-Man'' sign, your hairy underarms adding just the
right touch of ``savoir faire'' to the proceedings, hoping maybe
you'll get your shot on national television.
</P>
<P>
   And you dress like that, wearing a so-called muscle shirt when
whatever muscle you once had has turned to jelly? You must be so
very proud today.
</P>
<P>
   Or maybe that was you in your blue Dallas Cowboys' jersey,
hooting and jeering at Troy Aikman with drool rolling down your
chin and a beer bottle in your hand. Yeah, we saw you, too.
Unfortunately.
</P>
<P>
   There were hundreds, maybe thousands, of you Sunday at Texas
Stadium, mindlessly piling all the blame on one man wearing the No.
8 jersey. And I didn't see him miss a single tackle on Charlie
Garner while the 49ers' running back was rushing for 201 yards and
the 49ers were putting 41 points on the scoreboard.
</P>
<P>
   Ah, but Aikman is such an easy target, right? He's the
highest-paid player on the field. He's supposed to lead his team to
victory. If he can't do it, get another leader. As if Randall
Cunningham could have made a difference. What, you thought maybe
that Cowboys' offense was capable of scoring 42 points Sunday?
</P>
<P>
   Why not boo Emmitt Smith and his 31 yards rushing? Or that shell
of an offensive line? Or, best of all, that stop-nobody defense?
</P>
<P>
   The fact of the matter is, the only thing worse than the
Cowboys' performance Sunday was you. You, and you, and you.
</P>
<P>
   The Cowboys were embarrassing as a football team, but sometimes
that happens in the NFL. Sometimes you just have to go to the
bottom and start over. San Francisco has done that. The Cowboys did
it in 1989. That's the way the system is supposed to work.
</P>
<P>
   But you embarrassed us as a sports city by your ignorance. I've
never been one who believed paying for a ticket gives anyone the
right to be insulting and asinine, but I suppose if you feel
compelled to boo, at least target the entire team, not one man.
</P>
<P>
   That was a team loss Sunday and there will be more. So, if
booing is your bag, you're going to have plenty of opportunity to
make yourself heard.
</P>
<P>
   Yes, I know it comes with the territory for the quarterback.
Aikman understands that, too, far better than most. He's
maintaining as stoic a demeanor as possible under the
circumstances. But inside, he's hurting and hurting bad, because he
wants to be what you want him to be.
</P>
<P>
   He wants to be a winner. He helped bring you three Super Bowl
championships, remember? Now, you've turned on him like a rabid,
slavering dog.
</P>
<P>
   The sad truth is, you know you can get away with it. You know
you can hide in the crowd and leather-lung yourself until you're
blue in the face. You can hurl invectives and insults, spew hatred
and venom, and Aikman can't do a thing about it.
</P>
<P>
   What's he going to do, scream back? Flash you the bird? No, that
would make him no better than you and he won't stoop to your level.
</P>
<P>
   You also know that if someone came up and invited you to walk
into the locker room to meet Aikman face-to-face, giving you a
chance to tell him whatever you might like, you'd be as tongue-tied
and red-faced as a 6-year-old.
</P>
<P>
   Admit it, you'd ask him, your voice quivering, ``Please, Mr.
Aikman, sir, could I have your autograph? You're the best, Troy!''
</P>
<P>
   That's what makes you who you are. You're as despicably
two-faced as a bogus silver dollar.
</P>
<P>
   You want someone to blame? Then pay attention. Jerry Jones said
after Sunday's debacle that when you boo Aikman, you're really
booing him. Maybe you are, maybe you aren't, but if you just have
to boo, then there's your real target.
</P>
<P>
   It was Jones who made the decision _ maybe because he knows how
fickle you, the fandom, can be _ to try and keep this team together
for one or two more playoff runs. He knew exactly how fast you'd
bail on him if he admitted this team had no chance to win.
</P>
<P>
   So, Jones traded the Cowboys' immediate draft future to bring in
a speed receiver in Joey Galloway, now lost for the season. He has
played games with the salary cap, restructuring contracts, paying
out enormous bonuses, constantly extending the team's debt into the
future.
</P>
<P>
   You never complained. All you ever said was, ``Just do it,
Jerry. Just win.''
</P>
<P>
   The day of reckoning is now at hand. Did you really think it
would never come?
</P>
<P>
   The Cowboys' dance is over and the band has to be paid. All of
us get a little piece of that action.
</P>
<P>
   Aikman, for a lot of reasons, should just walk away, but his
pride and his sense of honor won't let him do that. He won't quit
on you like you've quit on him.
</P>
<P>
   He might, however, show up at your used car lot today and boo
the heck out of you while you're trying to make that all-important
sale.
</P>
<P>
   He'll scream gutter insults, demean your manhood and question
the legitimacy of your birth, but try not to let it bother you.
</P>
<P>
   It's nothing personal. nn

<P>
   The New York Times is publishing the following editors' note in
all editions of Tuesday, Sept. 26. If you published stories from
The New York Times News Service over the past several months
concerning the case of Wen Ho Lee or the security problems at the
Los Alamos National Laboratory, you may wish to publish this note
as well.
</P>
<P>
   From The Editors
</P>
<P>
   The New York Times and Wen Ho Lee
</P>
<P>
   On March 6, 1999, The New York Times reported that Government
investigators believed China had accelerated its nuclear weapons
program with the aid of stolen American secrets. The article said
the Federal Bureau of Investigation had focused its suspicions on a
Chinese-American scientist at the Los Alamos National Laboratory.
Two days later, the government announced that it had fired a Los
Alamos scientist for ``serious security violations.'' Officials
identified the man as Wen Ho Lee.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Lee was indicted nine months later on charges that he had
transferred huge amounts of restricted information to an easily
accessible computer. Justice Department prosecutors persuaded a
judge to hold him in solitary confinement without bail, saying his
release would pose a grave threat to the nuclear balance.
</P>
<P>
   This month the Justice Department settled for a guilty plea to a
single count of mishandling secret information. The judge accused
prosecutors of having misled him on the national security threat
and having provided inaccurate testimony. Dr. Lee was released on
the condition that he cooperate with the authorities to explain why
he downloaded the weapons data and what he did with it.
</P>
<P>
   The Times's coverage of this case, especially the articles
published in the first few months, attracted criticism from
competing journalists and media critics and from defenders of Dr.
Lee, who contended that our reporting had stimulated a political
frenzy amounting to a witch hunt. After Dr. Lee's release, the
White House, too, blamed the pressure of coverage in the media, and
specifically The Times, for having propelled an overzealous
prosecution by the administration's own Justice Department.
</P>
<P>
   As a rule, we prefer to let our reporting speak for itself. In
this extraordinary case, the outcome of the prosecution and the
accusations leveled at this newspaper may have left many readers
with questions about our coverage. That confusion _ and the stakes
involved, a man's liberty and reputation _ convince us that a
public accounting is warranted.
</P>
<P>
   In the days since the prosecution ended, the paper has looked
back at the coverage. On the whole, we remain proud of work that
brought into the open a major national security problem of which
officials had been aware for months, even years. Our review found
careful reporting that included extensive cross-checking and
vetting of multiple sources, despite enormous obstacles of official
secrecy and government efforts to identify The Times's sources. We
found articles that accurately portrayed a debate behind the scenes
on the extent and importance of Chinese espionage _ a debate that
now, a year and a half later, is still going on. We found clear,
precise explanations of complex science.
</P>
<P>
   But looking back, we also found some things we wish we had done
differently in the course of the coverage to give Dr. Lee the full
benefit of the doubt. In those months, we could have pushed harder
to uncover weaknesses in the F.B.I. case against Dr. Lee. Our
coverage would have been strengthened had we moved faster to assess
the scientific, technical and investigative assumptions that led
the F.B.I. and the Department of Energy to connect Dr. Lee to what
is still widely acknowledged to have been a major security breach.
</P>
<P>
   The Times neither imagined the security breach nor initiated the
case against Wen Ho Lee. By the time our March 6 article appeared,
F.B.I. agents had been looking closely into Dr. Lee's activities
for more than three years. A bipartisan congressional committee had
already conducted closed hearings and written a secret report
unanimously concluding that Chinese nuclear espionage had harmed
American national security, and questioning the administration's
vigilance. The White House had been briefed repeatedly on these
issues, and the secretary of energy had begun prodding the F.B.I.
Dr. Lee had already taken a lie detector test; F.B.I. investigators
believed that it showed deception when he was asked whether he had
leaked secrets.
</P>
<P>
   The Times's stories _ echoed and often oversimplified by
politicians and other news organizations _ touched off a fierce
public debate. At a time when the Clinton administration was
defending a policy of increased engagement with China, any
suggestion that the White House had not moved swiftly against a
major Chinese espionage operation was politically explosive.
</P>
<P>
   But the investigative and political forces were converging on
Dr. Lee long before The Times began looking into this story.
</P>
<P>
   The assertion in our March 6 article that the Chinese made a
surprising leap in the miniaturization of nuclear weapons remains
unchallenged. That concern had previously been reported in The Wall
Street Journal, but without the details provided by The Times in a
painstaking narrative that showed how various agencies and the
White House itself had responded to the reported security breach.
</P>
<P>
   The prevailing view within the government is still that China
made its gains with access to valuable information about American
nuclear weaponry, although the extent to which this espionage
helped China is disputed. And while the circle of suspicion has
widened greatly, Los Alamos has not been ruled out as the source of
the leak.
</P>
<P>
   The article, however, had flaws that are more apparent now that
the weaknesses of the F.B.I. case against Dr. Lee have surfaced. It
did not pay enough attention to the possibility that there had been
a major intelligence loss in which the Los Alamos scientist was a
minor player, or completely uninvolved.
</P>
<P>
   The Times should have moved more quickly to open a second line
of reporting, particularly among scientists inside and outside the
government. The paper did this in the early summer, and published a
comprehensive article on Sept. 7, 1999. The article laid out even
more extensively the evidence that Chinese espionage had secured
the key design elements of an American warhead called the W-88
while showing at the same time that this secret material was
available not only at Los Alamos but ``to hundreds and perhaps
thousands of individuals scattered throughout the nation's arms
complex.''
</P>
<P>
   That article, which helped put the charges against Dr. Lee in a
new perspective, appeared a full three months before the scientist
was indicted.
</P>
<P>
   Early on, our reporting turned up cautions that might have led
us to that perspective sooner. For example, the March 6 article
noted, deep in the text, that the Justice Department prosecutors
did not think they had enough evidence against the Los Alamos
scientist to justify a wiretap on his telephone. At the time, the
Justice Department refused to discuss its decision, but the fact
that the evidence available to the F.B.I. could not overcome the
relatively permissive standards for a wiretap in a case of such
potential gravity should have been more prominent in the article
and in our thinking.
</P>
<P>
   Passages of some articles also posed a problem of tone. In place
of a tone of journalistic detachment from our sources, we
occasionally used language that adopted the sense of alarm that was
contained in official reports and was being voiced to us by
investigators, members of Congress and administration officials
with knowledge of the case.
</P>
<P>
   This happened even in an otherwise far-seeing article on June
14, 1999, that laid out _ a half year before the indictment _ the
reasons the Justice Department might never be able to prove that
Dr. Lee had spied for China. The article said Dr. Lee ``may be
responsible for the most damaging espionage of the post-cold war
era.'' Though it accurately attributed this characterization to
``officials and lawmakers, primarily Republicans,'' such remarks
should have been, at a minimum, balanced with the more skeptical
views of those who had doubts about the charges against Dr. Lee.
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, far from stimulating a witch hunt, The Times had
clearly shown before Dr. Lee was even charged that the case against
him was circumstantial and therefore weak, and that there were
numerous other potential sources for the design of the warhead.
</P>
<P>
   There are articles we should have assigned but did not. We never
prepared a full-scale profile of Dr. Lee, which might have
humanized him and provided some balance.
</P>
<P>
   Some other stories we wish we had assigned in those early months
include a more thorough look at the political context of the
Chinese weapons debate, in which Republicans were eager to score
points against the White House on China; an examination of how Dr.
Lee's handling of classified information compared with the usual
practices in the laboratories; a closer look at Notra Trulock, the
intelligence official at the Department of Energy who sounded some
of the loudest alarms about Chinese espionage; and an exploration
of the various suspects and leads that federal investigators passed
up in favor of Dr. Lee.
</P>
<P>
   In those instances where we fell short of our standards in our
coverage of this story, the blame lies principally with those who
directed the coverage, for not raising questions that occurred to
us only later. Nothing in this experience undermines our faith in
any of our reporters, who remained persistent and fair-minded in
their newsgathering in the face of some fierce attacks.
</P>
<P>
   An enormous amount remains unknown or disputed about the case of
Dr. Lee and the larger issue of Chinese espionage, including why
the scientist transferred classified computer code to an easily
accessible computer and then tried to hide the fact (a development
first reported in The Times), and how the government case evolved.
Even the best investigative reporting is performed under deadline
pressure, with the best assessment of information available at the
time. We have dispatched a team of reporters, including the
reporters who broke our first stories, to go back to the beginning
of these controversies and do more reporting, drawing on sources
and documents that were not previously available. Our coverage of
this case is not over.

Chinese weapons debate, in which Republicans were eager to score
points against the White House on China; an examination of how Dr.
Lee's handling of classified information compared with the usual
practices in the laboratories; a closer look at Notra Trulock, the
intelligence official at the Department of Energy who sounded some
of the loudest alarms about Chinese espionage; and an exploration
of the various suspects and leads that federal investigators passed
up in favor of Dr. Lee.
</P>
<P>
   In those instances where we fell short of our standards in our
coverage of this story, the blame lies principally with those who
directed the coverage, for not raising questions that occurred to
us only later. Nothing in this experience undermines our faith in
any of our reporters, who remained persistent and fair-minded in
their newsgathering in the face of some fierce attacks.
</P>
<P>
   An enormous amount remains unknown or disputed about the case of
Dr. Lee and the larger issue of Chinese espionage, including why
the scientist transferred classified computer code to an easily
accessible computer and then tried to hide the fact (a development
first reported in The Times), and how the government case evolved.
Even the best investigative reporting is performed under deadline
pressure, with the best assessment of information available at the
time. We have dispatched a team of reporters, including the
reporters who broke our first stories, to go back to the beginning
of these controversies and do more reporting, drawing on sources
and documents that were not previously available. Our coverage of
this case is not over.

METROPOLITAN OPERA OPENS ITS SEASON 
</HEADLINE>
   By BERNARD HOLLAND    
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Opera has known its fleeting fames and forgotten
masterpieces, but `Don Giovanni' is not among them. Since its debut
at the Prague National Opera in 1787, Mozart's great work,
subtitled `The Libertine Punished,' has never been out of the
international repertory. Presented with a difficult piece fueled by
intricate ensembles and a swiftly moving libretto by Lorenzo da
Ponte, companies large and small have had their go at it. In the
`large' category is the Metropolitan Opera which opened its season
with `Don Giovanni' on Monday night.
</P>
<P>
   Opening night at the Met is not for the fashion-conscious faint
of heart. Neither, however, is Franco Zeffirelli's ponderous
production, which though less flamboyant than usual still delights
in dwarfing humankind under soaring pillars and furiously
decorative detail.
</P>
<P>
   The first thing to wriggle free from these attention-grabbing
surroundings was the exceptional cast. Renee Fleming sang Donna
Anna; Bryn Terfel, known as much for his exquisite diction as for
his stage presence, played the Don. Most Mozartian baritones long
for the chance to do both major men's parts in `Don Giovanni, each
blessed with marvelous music attached to very different
personalities. Ferruccio Furlanetto, the evening's Leporello, has
made a mini-career of alternating the two parts. Terfel makes the
switch this season: a former Leporello in the house now in the
title role.
</P>
<P>
   A newcomer, the Norwegian soprano Solveig Kringelborn, sang
Donna Elvira with a clean intensity. Hei-Kyung Hong was a Zerlina
of jewel-like precision. Paul Groves was the dignified, affecting
if modest sounding Don Ottavio. James Levine conducted with special
passion and customary elegance.
</P>
<P>
   Also elevating the evening above the level of spectacle was
Stephen Lawless's spruced-up restaging: a reworking terribly
effective not for any coups or startling effects but for the care
and intelligence of its detail. This was the kind of true theater
that opera in general, especially in a nightly repertory house,
does not often come near to. There was purpose in every gesture. In
keeping with the old laws of physics, for every action one
experienced thought-out and plausible reaction.
</P>
<P>
   Terfel comes to the Don with his own powerful if somewhat
repugnant point of view. If the production is about period
elegance, the character itself achieves a modern meanspiritedness.
Endearing naughtiness is replaced with outright sadism. This is a
coldly obsessive figure for whom rape and murder is not offhand but
committed with pleasure. This not very nice man, on the other hand,
sings like an angel.
</P>
<P>
   Fleming's Donna Anna had unusual breadth. `Non mi dir' at the
end luxuriated in the softness of her timbre, yet the early scenes
abandoned beauty for its own sake and took on a wonderful
fierceness. She is in both moods a splendid musician; the attention
to rhythm, phrase length and pitch legitimized the emotion.
</P>
<P>
   It was a cast without significant weakness. John Relyea was the
assertive Masetto, Sergei Koptchak a deeply eloquent Commendatore.
Lawless' prowess along with new costumes (Sylvia Nolan) and
lighting (Wayne Chouinard) helped take some of the gloom from Mr.
Zeffirelli's slightly aging stage pictures. Superior musicmaking
made it a very special night at the opera.

SPORTS COLUMN: THE WHITE SOX ARE SHOWING THAT SOMETIMES LESS CAN BE
MORE 
</HEADLINE>
   By MURRAY CHASS   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ No greater irony could impose itself on the playoffs
than the presence of the Chicago White Sox. No. 26 in the Major
League Baseball payroll standing for most of the season, the White
Sox have the majors' best won-lost record and are the newly crowned
champions of the American League Central.
</P>
<P>
   That the White Sox could go so far on so little is a tribute to
every facet of their organization, beginning with Jerry Reinsdorf,
the chairman. But that's where irony rears its delicious head.
</P>
<P>
   As the players association's Enemy No. 1, as an owner who would
fight the players to the catastrophic end over control of players
salaries, Reinsdorf has produced a team that undermines every
argument the owners make about salaries and payroll disparity. At a
time when officials and owners have identified payroll disparity as
the game's most pressing problem, a team that pays its players
one-third the amount the Yankees pay theirs has already clinched
its spot at the postseason party, while the Yankees still plod on
to secure their place.
</P>
<P>
   Not only that, but the Cleveland Indians, with a payroll twice
that of the White Sox, have been bumped from their perennial place
in the A.L. Central and may not even earn an invitation to the
party.
</P>
<P>
   But then, in terms of economic impact, this has been a very
different season from last. Last season the playoffs were populated
by teams with 8 of the 11 highest payrolls. The trend was painfully
clear, officials and owners lamented, and would never be reversed
without some drastic change in the system.
</P>
<P>
   A big payroll did not guarantee postseason play, they said in a
frequent refrain, but a team could not reach postseason play
without a big payroll. But this is a new year. Times have changed
quickly. This season only four or five of the top 14 teams in
payroll will play games after next Sunday. They are the Yankees,
the Mets, Atlanta, St. Louis and maybe the Indians.
</P>
<P>
   The Los Angeles Dodgers and the Baltimore Orioles once again
lead the big spenders who have gained the least for their money.
One wonders if they'll ever get it right. The Arizona Diamondbacks,
who won a division championship last season, added about $10
million to their payroll this season, but may as well spend this
October in the swimming pool beyond the right-center-field fence at
their ballpark. Those three teams began the season among the top
five in payroll.
</P>
<P>
   Seattle, on the other hand, was 15th and San Francisco 17th.
Close to the bottom were the White Sox and just ahead of them the
Oakland Athletics. Three or all four of those teams will play
postseason games.
</P>
<P>
   In the interest of having Reinsdorf, the most militant of
owners, explain how his poorly paid White Sox could outplay far
wealthier teams, a telephone call was placed to his office in
Chicago Monday and then a request for a telephone interview was
placed with the team's public relations department. The subject of
the interview was provided.
</P>
<P>
   ``No, thanks,'' came the reply from Reinsdorf via a club
spokesman. Maybe he's saving his secrets for a book. But is this
any way to persuade the players something has to be done to adjust
payrolls?
</P>
<P>
   Billy Beane, the Athletics' general manager, was not as reticent
about addressing the subject.
</P>
<P>
   ``Certainly we'd like to make that an antiquated argument,'' he
said, referring to the payroll-disparity issue. ``But the realism
of it all is I think this is a pretty unique situation in Oakland.
It's a testament to the talent of the young players who are here,
but the system hasn't allowed any guarantee that we can retain our
best players in the prime of their careers. These young players are
not going go be young and inexpensive for long.''
</P>
<P>
   Beane's last comment was one of the points Commissioner Bud
Selig made. ``I won't deny there's a potential for an aberration
once in a while,'' Selig said. ``But the fact is the cost of
keeping the White Sox up there will be so high. When the Reds
almost made it last year, Jim Bowden said don't think this
aberration makes the system right,'' he said referring to the
Cincinnati general manager.
</P>
<P>
   The White Sox and the Athletics aside, Selig said, disparity
remains a problem.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think you definitely have overwhelming evidence of a
correlation between high payroll and winning,'' he said. ``See me
next year. I'm confident of that. Remember, you still have the same
teams winning, the Yankees, Atlanta, the Mets. Let's see what
happens in the playoffs. If there's an aberration, it's a quick
short aberration.''
</P>
<P>
   He recalled what Drayton McLane Jr., the Houston owner, said of
the Astros' three division titles: ``Someone had to win the
National League Central, but we got banged out in the first round
each time.''
</P>
<P>
   Not surprisingly, the people in the union office offered a
different view of this season's developments.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think at a certain point you have to have some sympathy for
the owners,'' Gene Orza, the union's No. 2 man, said, then
proceeded to cite examples of dire projections some owners have
presented during labor negotiations in the last 15 years.
</P>
<P>
   ``In 1985 it was Oakland going out of business and they turned
around and won three division championships in a row,'' Orza said.
``Then they picked Pittsburgh, and Pittsburgh won a few division
championships. Then it was San Diego, but San Diego was in the
World Series. It's been a string of bad luck for them, almost
Kafkaesque bad luck.''
</P>
<P>
   If Reinsdorf shows up at any of the negotiating sessions next
year after talks for a new collective bargaining agreement begin,
the dialogue between him and Orza would probably be worth the price
of a playoff ticket.

TOLEDO EXPECTED TO MAKE QB CHANGE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By BILLY WITZ  
 c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ UCLA coach Bob Toledo hit the Paus button Monday.
Or was it the panic button?
</P>
<P>
   In the wake of UCLA's 29-10 loss to Oregon in Saturday's Pac-10
Conference opener, the UCLA coach announced that Cory Paus,
expected to be out for two more weeks with a separated right
throwing shoulder, has been cleared by doctors to begin practicing
in pads and will likely replace Ryan McCann as the Bruins' starting
quarterback against Arizona State Saturday night at the Rose Bowl.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have to evaluate him and see how he does (in practice),''
Toledo said. ``If Cory is ready to go and is 100 percent, then he
will start against Arizona State.
</P>
<P>
   ``I haven't made a clear-cut decision to do anything yet. I'm
saying if he's physically ready and shows it in practice that he's
capable of doing it, then he'll start. He threw it and threw it
well (during a light practice Monday). I'll definitely have an idea
by tomorrow.''
</P>
<P>
   Toledo took great pains to emphasize that Paus is completely
healed from the separated shoulder he suffered on the first play of
the season opener against Alabama and that he isn't being rushed
back into action.
</P>
<P>
   But Paus, who was cleared Thursday to return this week by team
physician Dr. Gerald Finerman, had his right shoulder wrapped in
ice after practice Monday and said he's still experiencing some
level of discomfort.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have to get some timing back and conditioning,'' said Paus,
who expects to start. ``Last week I was able to throw the ball
progressively better each day. I can tell I did something to my
shoulder a couple of weeks ago. There's a clicking sound and some
discomfort.''
</P>
<P>
   The same could be said for the Bruins' Pac-10 championship
prospects.
</P>
<P>
   McCann's uneven performances might have been enough to allow
UCLA to beat Michigan and Alabama, but the loss to Oregon means
that the Bruins have almost no margin for error if they hope to go
to the Rose Bowl, let alone the Orange Bowl.
</P>
<P>
   For the second year in a row, the Bruins could be out of the
Rose Bowl race by the first week in October.
</P>
<P>
   Thus, Toledo would rather put the Bruins' season in the hands of
a rusty Paus, who hasn't practiced in 3 weeks, than a capable but
frustratingly inconsistent McCann.
</P>
<P>
   Asked if his decision would have been the same if UCLA had
beaten Oregon with the same performance by McCann, Toledo paused
for a few seconds and said: ``Possibly.''
</P>
<P>
   When presssed, Toledo said: ``I'm being evasive now.''
</P>
<P>
   Paus did win the job convincingly in fall camp _ he was
consistently more accurate and had a better command of the offense
_ and Toledo said after the Alabama game that his players don't
lose their jobs because of injury. However, he left himself some
wiggle room, saying that if the team continued to win, it would be
tough to replace McCann.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we won and he played better, it would be a heck of a tough
question,'' offensive coordinator Al Borges said. ``But when do you
do it? Right now is the time. Let's see what he can do. When Joe
Montana got hurt, Steve Young came in and when Montana was healthy,
he was the quarterback.''
</P>
<P>
   Paus was originally expected to be cleared to return this week.
But two weeks ago, Toledo said he planned to hold Paus out against
Arizona State so that with next week's bye, he'd have an additional
two weeks before the Bruins played at Cal on Oct. 14. That would
give the shoulder additional time to heal and Paus plenty of work
in practice _ even if McCann had earned the starting job.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't know how healthy he was,'' Toledo said Monday. ``At
one point, they said it won't be until after the Arizona State
game. Now, he threw ball last week a little bit. This morning, they
came in and said he's cleared, he's ready to go.''
</P>
<P>
   McCann's statistics were certainly serviceable: 60 of 120 for
688 yards, four touchdowns and two interceptions. But his
inconsistency never gave Toledo or his offensive coordinator a
sense of comfort.
</P>
<P>
   While Toledo acknowledged a poor performance by the offensive
line and too many dropped balls by receivers against Oregon, much
of the blame for UCLA's decreased offensive production _ the Bruins
have scored fewer points each game _ was laid at McCann's doorstep.
</P>
<P>
   ``He had basically 12 quarters to show improvement and to move
the team and score some points,'' Toledo said. ``He made some
plays, but I was expecting him to make probably more.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our offensive game plan has been cut down to about a third of
what we normally do. Because of Cory, because of the experience,
we'll be able to put some of it back in. If you watched the games,
the tight ends (who have caught five passes in four games) have
been open. . . .
</P>
<P>
   ``When they've got nine guys on the line of scrimmage, you've
got to throw the ball. A year ago against Oregon, which was running
the same defense, Cory Paus threw for (332 yards and two
touchdowns) and we beat 'em. You've got to make 'em pay is what I'm
saying. When you can't make em pay, then you don't have an
offense.''
</P>
<P>
   McCann, who suffered a bruised left throwing shoulder and a
slightly pulled hamstring against Oregon that kept him out of most
drills Monday, was asked if he felt like a scapegoat.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't want to say that,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   He did, however, say that Toledo's decision caught him by
surprise _ even if he's been through this before, losing the job to
Paus in fall camp and getting benched against Fresno State.
</P>
<P>
   ``The roller coaster continues,'' McCann said. ``This is another
loop in the journey. It happens. It's rough _ it's really rough _
but I'm used to it now. The team didn't play well as a whole,
especially myself _ I contributed to that. There's not much to say.
They want to win and they didn't think I could be the guy who could
stay in there and win.''

HUNTER DENIES DRUG CHARGE 
</HEADLINE>
   By JERE LONGMAN   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   SYDNEY, Australia _ The husband of Marion Jones denied on
Tuesday that he had taken steroids and said that a mislabeled
nutritional supplement was responsible for elevated levels of the
performance-enhancing drug nandrolone in his system.
</P>
<P>
   The shot-putter C.J. Hunter tested positive for nandrolone at
the Bislett Games in Oslo, Norway, on July 28, track and field's
world governing body said Monday. He withdrew from the Olympics
before the Sydney Games started after undergoing orthoscopic knee
surgery.
</P>
<P>
   Tears streaking down his face, his voice breaking, Hunter said
at a news conference on Tuesday that he would do nothing to
embarrass Jones, or his children from a previous marriage. Jones is
attempting to become the first female track and field athlete to
win five gold medals in one Olympics.
</P>
<P>
   ``This has been a very difficult past couple of days for C.J.
and I,'' said Jones, who accompanied Hunter to the news conference
but did not answer questions. Jones, who won the 100 meters, will
compete in the 200, long jump, 4x100 relay and 4x400 relay between
now and Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am here to show my complete support for my husband,'' Jones
said. ``I have total and complete respect, and believe the legal
system will do what's needed to clear his name.''
</P>
<P>
   Hunter, and Victor Conte, executive director of Balco
laboratories in San Francisco and a nutritionist for some of the
athletes competing in Sydney, said that the shot-putter had been
using nutritional supplements, including an iron supplement, that
has been found to contain nandrolone. Hunter said he was unaware
that the supplements contained nandrolone, but would not identify
them.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have a lot of data that strongly indicates C.J. was not
using the anabolic steroid nandrolone,'' Conte said.
</P>
<P>
   Prince Alexandre de Merode, chief of the International Olympic
Committee's medical commission, said that Hunter had failed three
other drug tests this summer. Hunter said on Tuesday that
supplements were responsible for the other positive tests as well.
</P>
<P>
   Nandrolone has been easily detectable for years, and scientists
have been puzzled why a rash of cases involving the steroid has
surfaced in the past year. One possible reason is improperly
labeled nutritional supplements, scientists said. A number of
international track and field stars such as Linford Christie of
Britain, the 1992 Olympic champion at 100 meters; and the Olympian
Merlene Ottey of Jamaica have tested positive for the substance.
</P>
<P>
   The Los Angeles attorney Johnnie Cochran attended Tuesday's news
conference, saying he was a friend of the family. He represented
Jones when she was in high school and did not show up for a
scheduled drug test. She was later exonerated.
</P>
<P>
   ``Track and field has been great to me, but there is nothing
anyone could say or do or to get me to bring any kind of shame on
the people I love,'' Hunter said. He won the 1999 world
championship in the shot put and said he planned to retire after
the Sydney Games even before the positive drug tests.
</P>
<P>
   ``I might be downright mean at times,'' Hunter said, ``but
nobody on the planet can say I don't love my wife, don't love my
kids. I have never in my life nor would I ever do anything to
jeopardize their opinion of me.''
</P>
<P>
   He said he planned to vigorously defend himself, that he
expected to be exonerated and that he would remain in Sydney to
support Jones through her remaining events.
</P>
<P>
   ``No one can stop that,'' he said.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Hunter said he told Jones about the positive test on Monday
after reading and hearing news reports.
</P>
<P>
   He said he told her, ``I don't know what happened and I'm sorry.
She knows I would never do anything to hurt her.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   De Merode, the Olympics official, said the random tests were
analyzed by International Olympic Committee-accredited labs in
Rome, Barcelona and Oslo, which filed coded results with the IOC
and the IAAF, the international track federation.
</P>
<P>
   According to the Associated Press, the IAAF decoded the test
results and informed USA Track &AMP; Field that Hunter had failed the
tests, according to de Merode. Messages left for officials of the
IAAF and USATF were not immediately returned, although the agencies
have defended themselves against previous allegations that they
covered up drug cases.

TRACK HERO IS QUEEN FOR A DAY
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By DOUG KRIKORIAN  
 c.2000 Long Beach Press-Telegram  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SYDNEY, Australia _ The Australians almost voted out the Queen
of England as their figurative head of state in a referendum last
November, and the House of Windsor is fortunate they're not holding
an election today.
</P>
<P>
   No way Queen Elizabeth would survive it.
</P>
<P>
   There is only one queen who now reigns over this country.
</P>
<P>
   Queen Cathy.
</P>
<P>
   Oh yes, Cathy Freeman vaulted into athletic royalty and into the
hearts of an entire nation Monday night by winning the women's 400
meters at the Olympic Stadium before 110,000 patrons who broke the
sound barrier when she zipped past the finish line.
</P>
<P>
   If she had lost, it would have been the greatest tragedy to
strike this country since Gallipoli, for never has an athlete in
its history been showered with more adulation _ and unparalleled
media coverage _ than this proud 27-year-old Aborigine of enduring
resolve and resilience.
</P>
<P>
   But Cathy Freeman didn't lose. She streaked around the track in
her resplendent, gold-and-green, top-to-toe body suit, blowing past
Jamaica's Lorraine Graham and Great Britain's Katharine Merry down
the stretch to win pulling away at 49.1.
</P>
<P>
   And, after she had done what everyone here expected her to do _
and everyone wanted her to do _ she collapsed to the ground, head
bowed, catching her breath, as her rivals came over to offer
congratulations and the huge crowd roared with deafening passion.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was totally overwhelmed at that moment,'' she would say
later. ``I was feeling the crowd all over me. I could feel
everyone's emotion. I could feel it in every chord in my body.''
</P>
<P>
   There is no one in Australia at the moment even close in
popularity to Cathy Freeman, not Prime Minster John Howard, not Mel
Gibson, not Paul Hogan, not Elle McPherson, not Kate Blanchette,
not even Ian Thorpe or Dawn Fraser.
</P>
<P>
   It's not just Cathy Freeman's running skills that have inspired
such veneration that Monday's Australian newspapers were
overflowing with lengthy Freeman features. The Sydney Morning
Telegraph even printed ``The Race Of Our Lives'' as a main headline
above one of the stories.
</P>
<P>
   Clearly, Catherine Astrid Salome Freeman _ chosen to light the
Olympic cauldron at the opening ceremonies _ has become the
consciousness for a large segment of this country's population.
</P>
<P>
   She was running Monday night not only for Australia's sporting
glory but also for Aboriginal Australia, for a reconciled
Australia, for a hoped-for apology from the reluctant PM for past
injustices perpetuated by her people's government.
</P>
<P>
   She took her victory lap with the Australian and Aboriginal
flags draped around her shoulders, a not-so-subtle symbol of her
activism in regard to her heritage.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would hope this victory would make a difference in people's
attitudes toward the Aborigines,'' she said during her post-race
press session. ``I would hope it also would change the attitude of
some of the politicians.''
</P>
<P>
   But Cathy Freeman did not use her greatest triumph as a
political forum.
</P>
<P>
   She did not discuss the Aborigines' ``stolen generation,'' a
term used here in reference to those thousands of children who were
kidnapped from their parents and relocated in special camps by the
Australian government for a good portion of the 20th century. Her
maternal grandmother was one of them.
</P>
<P>
   Nor did she bring up other Aborigine grievances.
</P>
<P>
   She was in ecstasy on this brightest of nights for herself and
Australian athletics _ she is the first Aussie to win a gold in
track since Debbie Flintoff-King won the 400-meter hurdles at the
Seoul Olympics in 1988 _ and a soft smile never left her face as
she spoke in a voice that was hoarse.
</P>
<P>
   Someone wanted to know what moved her more, igniting the Olympic
flame or covering herself with gold.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'd have to say the Olympic gold medal means more to me
personally,'' she said. ``Getting to light the cauldron was a
tremendous honor, but that was more about the whole Olympic
movement. This was about me finally reaching my dreams.''
</P>
<P>
   And reaching deep into the souls of her adoring countrymen.

this time is that Latino designers are making the splash, rather
than Europeans appropriating bits and pieces of Latin styles.
Another article identifies 10 Latina ``mujeres'' (women) who

interesting article, though, is Gail Sheehy's bold stab at
analyzing George W. Bush's personality and his motives in running
for president. Her findings: Bush has shown a pattern in life of
exploding into ambition-fueled action when he has felt himself
teetering on the brink of failure. His personality has been molded
by trying to compensate for dyslexia and associated verbal
clunkiness, and short attention span ( but if so, how did the guy
manage to fly jet fighters in the Texas Air National Guard?). His
most heartfelt ambition may be to become baseball commissioner. Say
it ain't so, George.

MAVS' LAP OF LUXURY INCLUDES NEW CHAIRS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients)

c.2000 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   DALLAS _ Dallas Mavericks owner Mark Cuban has added some more
perks to his team's menu.
</P>
<P>
   Appalled at what he has seen in the past, Cuban has designed new
chairs for his players to sit in during games at Reunion Arena this
season. He also plans to install five-second clocks on the Reunion
court to assist referees during out-of-bounds plays, and has hired
a new deejay to play more modern music during timeouts.
</P>
<P>
   Cuban said the new chairs will be equipped with gadgets similar
to those in massage chairs. He also questioned how multimillionaire
NBA owners would allow players ranging from 5-foot-3 Muggsy Bogues
to 7-7 Gheorghe Muresan to sit in the same type of chairs.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it's crazy that guys who are anywhere from 5-10 to 7-6
all sit on the same type of chair,'' Cuban said. ``I don't know
about anybody else, but if I'm playing hard and I'm tired and my
muscles are tired, there are different types of chairs, and for my
guys I want to put them in the best position possible.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're having special chairs specially developed that'll be
patented and trademarked to us. We haven't decided if we're going
to sell them to anybody else in the NBA, but we will sell them to
other teams in college and high school, and we'll be introducing
them shortly.''
</P>
<P>
   Cuban said the chairs will not be on the visitors bench at
Reunion.
</P>
<P>
   ``We want to send a message (to opposing players),'' Cuban said.
``I want them to look and say, `How come they get that?' ''
</P>
<P>
   Recently, Cuban installed a VCR, DVD and flat screen TV in every
Mavericks player's locker at Reunion.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's the simple things that just get people to know that you
care, and it also creates the best financial opportunity,'' Cuban
said. ``Here's a business with the chairs that should have been
done a long time ago, and that's a business opportunity for us to
make more money.'' EXTRA WORKOUTS
</P>
<P>
   When veteran Howard Eisley and rookies Etan Thomas, Courtney
Alexander and Donnell Harvey recently worked out for three weeks at
UCLA with Mavericks developmental coach Kiki Vandeweghe, it wasn't
all basketball.
</P>
<P>
   Vandeweghe also had the players running on the UCLA track.
</P>
<P>
   ``Basketball is running and jumping,'' Vandeweghe said. ``So we
wanted something set up that focused on speed and explosion.''
</P>
<P>
   To extend the focus on track, Yolanda Taylor, a women's track
coach at SMU, will be at the Landry Center on Tuesday to lend her
expertise to the Mavericks.
</P>
<P>
   Vandeweghe also had Bong Su Han, a 69-year-old grandmaster
martial artist who has worked with the late Bruce Lee and Navy
Seals, work with the players.
</P>
<P>
   ``Basically what we tried to get out of that is flexibility, a
warrior's mentality, focus and mental toughness,'' Vandeweghe said.
``The guys who are heavily successful are the biggest
competitors.''

U.S. TOPS SOFTBALL DEMONS
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
   &LR; SYDNEY, Australia _ The two Australian batters standing between
Lisa Fernandez and a shot at a second consecutive Olympic gold
medal Monday were Peta Edebone and Joanne Brown.
</P>
<P>
   Yikes! Talk about staring down your demons.
</P>
<P>
   Edebone's walk-off home run off Fernandez in the 13th inning of
a preliminary game last week had struck a stinging blow to the U.S.
team's hopes of successfully defending its 1996 title. Its only
loss of those Atlanta Games had come in a preliminary game against
Australia, when Brown broke up Fernandez's perfect game with a
10th-inning homer.
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. had done well to climb back into medal contention after
suffering three straight losses last week, quite a comeuppance for
a team that had previously cobbled together a 112-game winning
streak.
</P>
<P>
   Fernandez didn't want the climb to be all for naught, and it
showed as she led the U.S. to a 1-0 victory over Australia in the
semifinal matchup. Australia earned the bronze medal with the loss,
while the U.S. moves on to the final.
</P>
<P>
   The former UCLA standout was determined to give the U.S. another
chance to plant Old Glory on the Olympic summit. The Americans had
a 1-0 lead, having capitalized on two Aussie errors in the fifth to
post the game's only score.
</P>
<P>
   As she prepared to pitch to Edebone, the Long Beach resident
said a prayer: ``Help me make the best pitches of my life.''
</P>
<P>
   She had pitched magnificently to that point, striking out 13 of
the 21 batters she had faced.
</P>
<P>
   She kept the ball down against Edebone and managed to get the
Aussie outfielder to hit a grounder to third. Jennifer Brundage
scooped the ball up nicely and her throw to first was just in time.
</P>
<P>
   Fernandez then got Brown to hit a chopper back to the mound. She
fielded it cleanly and fired the ball to first for the game's final
out. Her pitching line, as usual, was sublime: 13 strikeouts, one
walk and one hit allowed in seven innings.
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. played Japan for the gold medal today.
</P>
<P>
   ``(Second baseman) Dot (Richardson) challenged me not to give
up,'' Fernandez said. ``She said, `Lisa, why would you play this
game if it wasn't challenging.' ''

 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   SPOKANE, Wash. _ Sounding his new slogan intended to raise
anxieties about the nation's well-being, Gov. George W. Bush
accused the Clinton administration on Monday of helping create an
``education recession'' in which minority and low-income students
were routinely allowed to fail.
</P>
<P>
   Seeking to draw a clear link between the nation's future
economic health and the quality of its schools, Bush asserted that
the nation faced a reading crisis that had contributed to crime and
caused American students to fall behind their peers in other
industrialized nations.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a leading indicator of troubles to come,'' Bush told
500 supporters early on Monday at an elementary school in
Beaverton, Ore., 10 miles west of Portland. ``Children who never
master reading can never master learning. As uneducated adults,
they face a life of struggle on the fringes of our society. Some
will turn to crime and end up in prison.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush, the Republican nominee for president, outlined his
proposals to improve grade school reading programs, expand
scholarship programs for math and science students and encourage
annual testing of students in grades three through eight. He
accused his Democratic opponent, Vice President Al Gore, of
promising change but instead protecting a failed status quo.
</P>
<P>
   ``They call for new spending without real reform or
accountability,'' the Texas governor said. ``It's like pumping gas
into a flooded engine.''
</P>
<P>
   Kym Spell, a spokeswoman for the Gore campaign, countered that
Bush would not be able to afford his education proposals because he
would need the entire federal surplus to pay for his military
programs and tax cuts. Bush denies that.
</P>
<P>
   Bush's school event kicked off a three-day swing on the West
Coast that on Monday took him through Washington and Oregon, states
where Democrats have carried recent presidential elections but
where polls show Bush running neck-and-neck with Gore.
</P>
<P>
   In both states, Ralph Nader, the Green Party candidate, has
recently drawn enthusiastic crowds of more than 10,000 people and
is considered a threat to draw disaffected Democrats away from
Gore.
</P>
<P>
   Later on Monday, Bush told several hundred supporters at an
airport rally here that he would oppose breaching hydroelectric
dams on the Snake River, as some environmentalists had proposed, to
improve salmon habitats. He also attacked Gore for having said he
wanted to study the issue further.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's worried about some kind of group's not liking him,'' Bush
said. ``He wants to study it as way of not taking a position.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush also plans to spend two days in California, where polls
show Gore holding a comfortable lead. Part of Bush's goal is to tap
into the state's wealth: he plans to raise more than $1.4 million
for the state Republican Party at Silicon Valley and Los Angeles
fund-raisers.
</P>
<P>
   But Bush's communications director, Karen P. Hughes, asserted
that the governor also wanted to show that he planned to contest
California until Election Day.
</P>
<P>
   ``He wouldn't be going there, at a critical point in the
campaign, if we didn't think we could compete in California,''
Hughes said.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Coming about a week before what will probably be among the most
important moments of the fall campaign _ a nationally televised
debate with Gore _ Monday's event in Beaverton also gave Bush an
opportunity to fine-tune his message on a signature issue before a
friendly audience.
</P>
<P>
   Bush did not hold a news conference but instead fielded gently
worded questions from the largely partisan audience. With each
response, Bush expounded on his plans to cut taxes, increase
military spending and improve education.
</P>
<P>
   While Bush has sought to lay blame for the nation's education
problems squarely on the administration's doorstep, many educators
contend that the federal government plays a relatively minor role
in primary and secondary education. The most important decisions _
on curriculum, standards, testing, personnel and construction _ are
made by state and local officials.
</P>
<P>
   Bush himself acknowledged the limitations of federal action on
Monday, noting that Washington provides only 7 percent of public
education spending.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not as if the federal government is going to solve 100
percent of the problems,'' he said. ``The best education is that
where it's focused at the state and local government.''
</P>
<P>
   The focus of Bush's education plan is to ensure that all
children read proficiently by the fourth grade. He would provide
aid to help primary schools expand reading programs and reward
schools that administered standardized tests annually to help
educators identify learning problems early. For those and other
proposals, Bush has called for increasing federal education
spending by $47 billion over 10 years.
</P>
<P>
   Schools that failed to reduce the gap in test scores between
low-income students and their more affluent peers in three years
would lose some of their federal Title I funds, which are earmarked
for low-income children. That money, $1,500 a student, would be
given directly to parents of children in failing schools, who could
use it for other educational purposes, like hiring tutors or paying
private-school tuition.
</P>
<P>
   Gore has called for increasing federal education spending by
$115 billion over 10 years to help districts build new schools,
provide preschool for most students, hire more teachers and raise
teacher salaries.
</P>
<P>
   Like Bush, he has proposed withholding federal aid from states
where test scores do not improve. But unlike his opponent, he would
redirect that money to the local schools with the greatest
problems, rather than give it to parents.
</P>
<P>
   Toward the end of the education event in Beaverton, Bush was
asked what could be done to help students reconnect with politics,
and he recommended that candidates not make decisions based on
polls or focus groups.
</P>
<P>
   But the Bush campaign is not completely averse to such tools;
the phrase ``education recession'' was carefully poll-tested before
Mr. Bush first deployed it on Monday.
</P>
<P>
   While Bush was pitching his education ideas, his running mate,
Dick Cheney, continued his attacks on Gore, accusing him of having
a conflict of interest involving stock and oil prices.
</P>
<P>
   Cheney told reporters in Springfield, Ohio, that Gore supported
extending a moratorium on royalties paid by United States companies
drilling for natural gas in the Gulf of Mexico. That position,
Cheney said, would benefit Occidental Petroleum _ a company whose
stock is held in a trust belonging to Gore's mother.
</P>
<P>
   ``Gore continues to be the prospective beneficiary of holdings
of stock in Occidental Petroleum in the family trust,'' Cheney
said, ``and I think that that does constitute a conflict of
interest.''
</P>
<P>
   Cheney said the vice president should either recuse himself from
participating in decisions about energy policy or ask his mother to
divest the family trust of oil stocks.
</P>
<P>
   Spell, the spokeswoman for Gore, said that the vice president
neither owned nor controlled any stock in Occidental and that there
was no way of knowing what stocks would be in the family trust when
he inherited them.  &QL;

POLL SHOWS BISTATE TAX FOR ARTS AND SPORTS STILL HAS SUPPORT 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JEFFREY SPIVAK  
 c. 2000 Kansas City Star   By more than a two-to-one margin, a new
poll shows that area residents support continuing the bistate
cultural sales tax, but this time with the money going to upgrade
sports stadiums and arts programs.
<TEXT>
<P>
   One-third of respondents were people who would vote for
something they don't like because it would be good for the
community, according to the telephone poll commissioned by the
Greater Kansas City Chamber of Commerce.
</P>
<P>
   ``These are very encouraging results,'' pollster Neil Newhouse
said Monday during a series of local presentations on the results.
</P>
<P>
   The combination of sports and arts, Newhouse said, ``seems like
a shotgun wedding, but a lot of voters think this is what's needed
to keep Kansas City a major-league city.''
</P>
<P>
   That's one take on the findings. Kansas State Rep. Kay O'Connor
of Olathe has another view of public sentiment on the tax.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's not the reaction of my constituents: Two-to-one, they
hate it,'' O'Connor said. ``My problem with bistate is a loss of
sovereignty of Kansas dollars. We have tax dollars being spent by
people who aren't Kansans. I think it's a wrong use of state tax
dollars.''
</P>
<P>
   The original bistate cultural tax, a one-eighth-cent sales tax,
was passed by voters in four counties in 1996 to help renovate
Union Station. Now that the station has reopened, the chamber is
pursuing a second use for that tax. It successfully lobbied for
legislative changes in Missouri and Kansas to include sports
facilities in the definition of culture.
</P>
<P>
   A second bistate tax _ dubbed Bistate II _ can't go to voters
until after the original one expires in the spring of 2002. It's
not clear how much money it would raise, but the first bistate tax
was expected to net $118 million.
</P>
<P>
   The new poll, which asked whether residents would extend the tax
for 14 years for arts and improvements to the Truman Sports
Complex, nearly replicated the outcome of the first bistate
election.
</P>
<P>
   Jackson County's support for the tax was 66 percent in the poll
_ and 66 percent in the bistate election. Johnson County's support
was 58 percent in the poll and 60 percent in the election. Clay's
was 59 percent and 60 percent, while Platte's was 67 percent and 61
percent.
</P>
<P>
   The new poll combined results of two surveys, both conducted in
late August of 500 likely voters and both with a margin of error of
plus or minus 4 percent.
</P>
<P>
   In all, 62 percent indicated they would definitely or probably
vote yes for a second bistate, with 30 percent saying they would
vote no or probably no and 8 percent undecided.
</P>
<P>
   Newhouse's report, however, noted there are opponents to the
bistate tax who ``believe they are overtaxed...and they believe
that these cultural arts organizations and sports teams should be
paying their own way.
</P>
<P>
   ``Many of those who oppose the continuation of the bistate do so
strongly, and express their opinions regarding it with passion,''
according to the report.
</P>
<P>
   But the margin of support found by the poll surprised some
chamber leaders. When the Kansas House considered the bistate
legislation this past spring, some Johnson County legislators said
most of their calls and letters from constituents opposed a second
tax.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought this would become a horrendously unpopular idea, and
that's not the case at all,'' said Steve Rose, a chamber board
member who led the Kansas-side election campaign for the original
bistate tax.
</P>
<P>
   Supporters said Bistate II has several things going for it that
the original bistate didn't.
</P>
<P>
   First, the new proposal _ which calls for renovating the
stadiums so the Chiefs and Royals aren't enticed to leave town _
feeds more on Kansas City's identity as a major-league city. In the
poll, more than 90 percent of respondents thought that status was
``important.''
</P>
<P>
   As one respondent put it, ``It's the difference between Kansas
City and Omaha.''
</P>
<P>
   In addition, bistate now has a track record. Two-thirds of poll
respondents reported having a ``favorable'' impression of how Union
Station's redevelopment was handled. And the tax already is in
place so there's no need for a ``new'' tax, only an extension.
</P>
<P>
   ``The biggest stumbling block was faced four years ago,''
Newhouse said. ``This being a continuation is just more palatable
for voters.''
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, the veteran Washington, D.C.-based pollster also
acknowledged that a lot of time remained between this summer's poll
and an eventual election and a lot could change.
</P>
<P>
   For now, the chamber and a metropolitan arts council are
beginning discussions with arts groups about how to divide bistate
money among different arts projects and organizations.

ELECTION BARB TRADE JUMPS UP AN OCTAVE 
 &HT;     BY CARLA MARINUCCI
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     c.2000 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
 &LR;   &LR;  SAN FRANCISCO _ Sen. Joe Lieberman, aiming for a pre-emptive
strike at Texas Gov. George W. Bush's campaign stop Tuesday in
California, charged the GOP presidential campaign with resorting to
``personal attack politics'' instead of focusing on real issues
like improving schools.
<P>
   ``The campaign is about issues like Medicare and education
reform,'' Lieberman said in a telephone interview with The
Chronicle Tuesday. ``It seems to be the way they are trying to come
back up ... but it's not what this campaign should be about.''
</P>
<P>
   With Bush scheduled to arrive in the Bay Area last night, his
campaign is fighting close races in several states, attacking Gore
for ``making up facts'' about his life _ from his mother-in-law's
prescription drug costs to childhood lullabies he heard _ while
pushing hard on issues.
</P>
<P>
   In a two-day trip to California, Bush is expected to discuss
education policy in a meeting with students and teachers at Redwood
City's Sequoia High School this morning and attend a fund-raiser at
the Atherton home of Carol Bartz, CEO of San Rafael-based software
maker Autodesk.
</P>
<P>
   He will then fly to Los Angeles, where he plans an appearance
alongside Cardinal Roger Mahony in an event stressing science and
math education in a Latino area of South Central Los Angeles. Bush
will also appear on ``Larry King Live'' and attend another
political fund-raiser.
</P>
<P>
   Bush's trip to the Bay Area comes as a new KTVU/Examiner poll
released this week shows him continuing to run behind in the
nation's most populous state by double digits. His state campaign
insists he will continue to fight on here.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've said we planned to compete to win in California. And
that plan includes visits by (Republican vice presidential nominee
Dick) Cheney and Bush, a full ground game and paid media,'' said
Gerry Parsky, who heads the Bush campaign in California. ``We
believe that, although we remain behind, it's winnable.''
</P>
<P>
   But before the GOP candidate's campaign plane even touched down
in California, Lieberman was on the phone to political reporters in
the state _ where 54 electoral votes hang in the balance _ to
counter the Texas governor's message that the country is in the
throes of an ``education recession'' under the Clinton-Gore
administration.
</P>
<P>
   ``That comment is just not fair to educators and teachers and
parents all over America (who) worked very effectively with their
local, state and federal governments to improve the quality of
public schools,'' said Lieberman, who spoke between campaign
appearances in New Jersey.
</P>
<P>
   Lieberman challenged Bush's suggestion that test scores have
dropped, saying they are in fact on the rise.
</P>
<P>
   ``But we've got a ways to go,'' he added. ``Al and I have said
we're not going to rest until America's public schools are the best
in the world.''
</P>
<P>
   The Bush-Cheney plan lacks money to invest in education
``because they spend it all on their tax cuts,'' Lieberman said.
``There's a lot more beef in our proposal.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush's campaign spokeswoman Mindy Tucker countered that the
Clinton-Gore administration has spent ``a lot of money in the last
four years (on education) and gotten nothing for it.
</P>
<P>
   ``As Gov. Bush has shown in Texas, if you hold schools
accountable and expect the best out of students, they will rise to
the challenge,'' Tucker said.
</P>
<P>
   With 42 days left until the presidential election _ and a week
until the first televised presidential debate _ the increasingly
tough back and forth between the campaigns illustrates a narrowing
focus on certain issues and on the undecided voters who will count
most.
</P>
<P>
   Lieberman's defense of Gore came the same day the vice
president, campaigning with his wife, Tipper, in crucial Florida,
released a 74-page plan for what he called ``a rock solid
commitment'' to Medicare. Gore promised he would put the program
``in an iron-clad lock box with a sign that says, `Politicians,
hands off,' '' and charged that Bush would force some elderly into
welfare offices to get prescription drugs, violating ``their sense
of dignity.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush's camp strongly refuted the charges, and counter-blasted
Gore's plan as a ``government-run pharmacy.''
</P>
<P>
   Lieberman took particular offense to that characterization
Monday.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's another name for a government-run HMO _ it's called
Medicare,'' he said. ``And it's one of the most successful and
effective and humane programs the federal government has created,''
he said. `It's providing medical services for the elderly and it's
keeping them healthier, and in many cases alive longer.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We've got a lot of real money set aside _ more than a quarter
of a trillion dollars _ for this prescription Medicare drug
benefit. All I ask is seniors to compare,'' he told The Chronicle.
``Under the Bush-Cheney plan, the senior gets basically a slip and
has to go out and find an HMO that will give them prescription
drugs. ... I don't think the HMOs are going to want to do that.''
</P>
<P>
   Lieberman saved his toughest words for the Bush campaign's
recent strategy _ with appearances by Cheney on weekend talk shows
and in campaign e-mails _ suggesting that the vice president has
been guilty of ``making up facts'' about his life.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not right about the vice president,'' Lieberman
responded. One charge _ that Gore said his mother sang him the
``union label'' jingle as an infant when the jingle wasn't yet in
use _ is distorted, he said. The remark, made during a speech to
union members, ``was a joke,'' Lieberman said.
</P>
<P>
   And another controversial Gore remark about his mother-in-law's
prescription drug prices ``actually made an important point: that
seniors do pay more,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Parsky countered by saying ``there have been examples over the
last several weeks of Gore saying one thing and doing another. And
Californians are not going to react well to that.''

A DUFFER'S STROKE OF LUCK
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     By SCOTT OSTLER 
 &HT;     c.2000 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
 &LR;   &LR;  SAN FRANCISCO _ First Sign Of Fall: George Lazar and a friend
were in George's pickup truck last Wednesday, on their way to
opening night of the Symphony, when George realized his error.
<P>
   Lazar remembered that his golf clubs were in the back of the
truck. The truck has a camper shell, but he knew he would be
parking somewhere around City Hall, not the most secure parking
area of town.
</P>
<P>
   George found a spot near the Main Library. He couldn't leave the
clubs exposed to view, so he used a ratty old sleeping bag to
carefully hide his prized clubs.
</P>
<P>
   After the Symphony when Lazar and his friend returned to the
truck, they saw that the hatch of the camper shell had been jimmied
open.
</P>
<P>
   George's heart sank. His Titleist clubs are worth about $1,800.
Also in the bag were several specialty clubs, including a rare
Scottie Cameron putter. And Lazar is between homeowner's policies,
so this loss would be out-of-pocket.
</P>
<P>
   Cringing, George pulled open the back hatch. The clubs were
there. The thief had made off with the sleeping bag.
</P>
<P>
   SWEETEST RIDE: Parking shortage in San Francisco? What parking
shortage? You just need the right wheels.
</P>
<P>
   A mysterious Marin man went to Canada and bought himself a new
Go-4 Interceptor, the little putt-putt cart that San Francisco
meter maids drive.
</P>
<P>
   He got a blue-and-white model with yellow lights on the roof,
identical to the official S.F. model. It cost him about $18,000.
</P>
<P>
   And he's been using the cart to commute into the city, either
for errands or for work, although the vehicle isn't safe at freeway
speeds.
</P>
<P>
   Supposedly the owner told the cart company people that he was
buying the cart for the express purpose of beating the S.F. parking
system.
</P>
<P>
   No Parking Control Officer (meter maid) is going to ticket
another PCO's cart. This man's cart doesn't have the official gold
S.F. seal, but apparently he was banking on PCOs not looking
closely enough to notice.
</P>
<P>
   But then one morning an alert Dept. of Parking &AMP; Traffic
employee spotted the cart speeding over the Golden Gate Bridge into
the city.
</P>
<P>
   He noticed that the cart had no official markings and no license
plate, and thought it was stolen, so he gave chase. But he
abandoned the pursuit when the cart driver blew through a red light
at Cesar Chavez.
</P>
<P>
   Later DPT issued an internal memo, alerting all meter maids to
keep an eye out for the little hot rod, and if it is found
illegally parked, get it towed.
</P>
<P>
   So the heat is on and the mystery man's free-parking days might
be numbered.
</P>
<P>
   Picture this: A high-speed chase through the hills of the city,
a legion of PCO putt-putts in hot pursuit of the Phantom
Meter-Cheater.
</P>
<P>
   Eat your heart out, Steve McQueen.
</P>
<P>
   THRILL RIDE: Little cable cars climbing halfway to the stars, no
problem.
</P>
<P>
   It's the coming back down that we need to worry about.
</P>
<P>
   I'm not saying the beloved cable cars are dangerous. But it does
appear that Muni is having a harder and harder time finding
qualified people to coax and crank the cars up and down the hills.
</P>
<P>
   Some cable car grip operators (in the front working the big
levers) and conductors (in back working the wheel brake and
collecting fares) say there's a grip shortage.
</P>
<P>
   The candidates Muni sends over for grip training are either too
old to handle the physical demands of the job or too young and
clumsy.
</P>
<P>
   ``Kids today (training as grips) can't walk, talk and chew
gum,'' one conductor told me. ``I think it's computers. Kids don't
play ball, they don't develop coordination. A lot of (the
candidates) can't even qualify as conductors _ bells and brakes and
talkin' and taking money.''
</P>
<P>
   The grip on the same car, also a cable-car veteran, said, ``Last
year Muni sent over (from other divisions) 20 guys for (grip)
training, and only four of them made it through.
</P>
<P>
   ``Plus,'' he added, ``we've got a lot of people with bad
attitudes. Chips on their shoulders. We deal with tourists who ask
the same questions, and some guys develop an attitude. Hey, we're
here to make these people enjoy themselves.''
</P>
<P>
   The injury problem is still major, too. Pulling on the iron all
day requires strength, and backs give out.
</P>
<P>
   The biggest complaint, though, is still the turntable at Market
and Powell. It used to be possible for a child to spin a car around
the table.
</P>
<P>
   Now it takes both crewmen and sometimes a third helper, pushing
and straining, to turn the table. The mechanism has been in need of
repair for years, and has knocked dozens of crew people into
disability, costing the city millions of dollars.
</P>
<P>
   The table needs to be be rebuilt or realigned, but hey, that
would cost a lot of money.
</P>
<P>
   Ding-ding.

 OIL COLORS PRESIDENTIAL CONTEST  &HT;     By ROBERT COLLIER 
 &HT;     c.2000 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
<P>
   After many years of prosperity spurred by low oil prices,
American voters are being confronted by an old bogeyman _ oil
politics.
</P>
<P>
   As crude oil prices soar to 10-year highs, gasoline prices
continue to climb and warnings of winter heating-oil shortages grow
louder, Democrat Al Gore and Republican George W. Bush are using
rhetoric not heard in America since the 1970s oil crisis.
</P>
<P>
   Gore rails against ``Big Oil'' and calls Bush and his running
mate, Dick Cheney _ both former oil executives _ tools of the
conglomerates. Bush, in turn, blames the Clinton administration for
coddling the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries, which
dominates the world's oil markets and has helped push prices up.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think one of the big factors involved here is whether or not
we're going to have a president who is willing to fight for people,
willing to stand up to Big Oil and foreign oil,'' Gore said last
week.
</P>
<P>
   Bush retorted that ``under this administration there has been no
energy policy.''
</P>
<P>
   The GOP candidate criticized President Clinton's decision on
Friday to release oil from the Strategic Petroleum Reserve _ a move
that had been urged by Gore, who clearly smelled a winning populist
issue. Bush said the stored oil ``should not be used as a
short-term political fix for somebody whose administration has been
asleep at the switch.''
</P>
<P>
   Despite the heated words, both candidates are ducking the fact
that U.S. dependency on foreign oil has increased, not decreased,
under both the Bush and Clinton administrations. Since President
Jimmy Carter declared his quest for energy self-sufficiency ``the
moral equivalent of war'' in 1977, the share of imported oil used
in the U.S. economy has risen from 40 percent to 56 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts say there is no quick fix, and any real solution _
whether devised by Republicans or Democrats _ is years away.
</P>
<P>
   Although Clinton's decision to release 30 million barrels from
the reserve is credited with bringing down the price of oil _ it
closed at $31.57 per barrel Monday, down from a high of $37.80 a
week ago _ analysts caution that prices are likely to stay near $30
a barrel for the foreseeable future, leaving Americans paying more
to fill their car tanks and heat their homes than they have in many
years.
</P>
<P>
   A barrel of crude fetched as little as $9 in early 1999, and
averaged less than $20 in the 1990s.
</P>
<P>
   The two leading candidates' proposals show markedly different
visions of America's future. Gore wants to reduce energy
consumption, stimulate production of natural gas and renewable
energy sources such as wind, solar and bio-fuels. Bush wants to
unleash domestic oil production from environmental restrictions and
aggressively pressure OPEC to increase its production and lower
prices.
</P>
<P>
   After a decade of low oil prices and economic boom, U.S.
consumers have been lulled into inattention to oil issues.
Gas-guzzling sport utility vehicles and vans comprise half of all
new cars sold annually, and the energy crises of yesteryear seem
far away _ if they are remembered at all.
</P>
<P>
   But experts say there is plenty to be concerned about:
</P>
<P>
   --Residents of the Northeast face steep heating oil prices this
winter and possible shortages. The supplies on hand, 48 million
barrels, are 34 percent below levels of a year ago. Industry and
government officials say that if temperatures this winter drop
significantly below normal, supplies will run out.
</P>
<P>
   --Gasoline prices are near 10-year highs, reaching an average of
$1.94 per gallon in Northern California last week.
</P>
<P>
   --California's electricity grid barely dodged blackouts this
summer. Consumer bills in San Diego and parts of Orange County
doubled this summer, prompting state regulators to institute rate
caps earlier this month.
</P>
<P>
   --Because of increased oil and gas prices, Americans are
spending an additional $115 billion _ nearly 1 percent of the gross
domestic product _ on energy this year. But some of that money is
recycled into the economy through stepped-up domestic oil
production, so the net decrease to GDP is estimated by economists
at 0.8 percent annually _ relatively small change in the roaring
U.S. economy.
</P>
<P>
   --In Europe, the situation is far worse. Protests over high fuel
prices have embarrassed governments in many of the continent's most
economically powerful nations, with bus and truck drivers blocking
highways to demand reductions in fuel taxes.
</P>
<P>
   As the higher energy prices ripple through the U.S. economy, the
biggest beneficiaries are obvious: oil giants such as Chevron,
ExxonMobil, Texaco and Conoco. Net income at some of these
conglomerates has almost doubled this year, their best performances
since the early 1980s.
</P>
<P>
   The oil firms _ which have long resented the negative publicity
they often receive _ have kept mum in the current debate.
</P>
<P>
   Major firms such as Chevron, Texaco, ExxonMobil and Halliburton
refused to comment for this article or did not return The
Chronicle's calls. The American Petroleum Institute, the major
industry federation, has limited its public comment to a communique
released last week criticizing Clinton's decision to release oil
stocks.
</P>
<P>
   Although the political flak and consumer grousing have dominated
media coverage of the issue, an unusual consensus has developed
among oil experts in the United States and OPEC nations that OPEC's
production cuts over the past year are not to blame for the current
crisis. They point to three principal culprits:
</P>
<P>
   --Low inventories. Major oil firms in the United States and
Europe have drawn their stocks of oil down to near record lows,
because they are unwilling to buy large amounts of crude at its
current high prices and are hoping that prices will soon fall. As a
result, the companies are unable to cushion sudden price spikes.
</P>
<P>
   --Full refineries. U.S. gasoline and heating-oil refineries are
running at 96 percent of capacity, and thus are unable to increase
production, which would lower prices.
</P>
<P>
   --Rampant speculation. Traders at the New York Mercantile
Exchange, where the world's oil prices are determined, have been
feverishly betting on the unknown _ whether Iraq will cut off its
oil exports as a means of pressuring for an end to the U.N.
embargo; whether storms could interrupt a major oil shipping
channel; whether America's multiyear string of unusually mild
winters could suddenly end.
</P>
<P>
   ``The fundamental problem has little to do with supply, and it's
unclear from either candidate's proposals that there will be any
short-term change (ahead),'' said Paul Cheng, an oil analyst for
the investment firm Lehman Brothers.
</P>
<P>
   In Caracas, Venezuela, where OPEC heads of state will gather
this week for a summit meeting, Mazhar Al-Shereidah, who publishes
a respected oil-industry newsletter, described it this way: ``It's
much easier for U.S. politicians to criticize OPEC than to explain
why the United States has increased its dependency on foreign oil
under governments of both parties.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's always easier to blame the foreigners, the Arabs, for
Americans' unwillingness to make hard choices'' on energy
conservation, he added.
</P>
<P>
   For both candidates, too much populist chest-thumping about oil
can get in the way of sensible policy making.
</P>
<P>
   Last month, Gore claimed that Cheney, as chief executive of the
Dallas-based oil services giant Halliburton Co., had praised OPEC
in early 1999  &LR; early last year for lowering production _ a move
that had the effect of raising oil prices. The Bush campaign
retorted that Energy Secretary Bill Richardson had said much the
same thing.
</P>
<P>
   Experts say the tit-for-tat exchange obscured the fact that both
sides had reacted correctly to a devastating price crash in oil _
about $10 per barrel at that time _ which was causing U.S. domestic
oil companies to lay off thousands of workers and cancel
much-needed investment programs.
</P>
<P>
   Many experts say that unless this year's fuel price increases
push the U.S. economy into recession, voters may be unwilling to
accept policies offered by either of the major parties _ the
Democratic recipe includes a more frugal lifestyle with lower
energy usage, while the Republican one calls for punching oil wells
into pristine Alaskan tundra and possibly offshore California
waters.
</P>
<P>
   ``The United States has been reinforcing OPEC's price-hike
strategy with our own consumer desires,'' said Lester Brown,
chairman of Worldwatch Institute, an environmental group based in
Washington.
</P>
<P>
   Although renewable energy sources provide only 4 percent of
current U.S. usage, Brown advocates spurring production in these
fields _ a policy that Gore backs, although more cautiously.
</P>
<P>
   Unfortunately for environmentalists like Brown, the U.S. economy
is much stronger than it was before the oil shocks of the 1970s and
1990, when price rises caused recession and forced energy
conservation onto the public agenda.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our abandonment of a real energy policy in the Reagan years is
still with us, and we will continue paying for it,'' he said.

CALIFORNIA GOV. DAVIS VETOES TAX ON WEB SALES
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     By LYNDA GLEDHILL 
 &HT;     c.2000 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SACRAMENTO _ Saying he is protecting California consumers, Gov.
Gray Davis Monday vetoed a bill first-in-the-nation bill that would
have forced many Internet retailers to charge sales tax.
</P>
<P>
   The governor's action protects California e-businesses from
being taxed immediately but leaves the door open for future
decisions on how best the state can reap financial rewards from the
rapidly expanding e-commerce industry.
</P>
<P>
   ``In order for the Internet to reach its full potential as a
marketing medium and job creator, it must be given time to
mature,'' Davis said in his veto message. ``At present, it is less
than 10 years old. Imposing sales taxes on Internet transactions at
this point in its young life would send the wrong signal about
California's international role as the incubator of the dot-com
community.''
</P>
<P>
   The bill, by Assemblywoman Carole Migden, D-San Francisco, would
have made Internet sales conform to laws governing catalog sales by
forcing Internet companies to charge sales tax if they have a
brick-and-mortar store in the state.
</P>
<P>
   The veto, while widely expected, leaves California still
wrestling with the highly charged debate about taxing the billions
of dollars of online sales of everything from books to patio
furniture.
</P>
<P>
   ``The issue is still there. How do we handle taxation of
e-commerce transactions?'' said Teresa Casazza, California vice
president of the American Electronics Association, which opposed
the Internet tax bill. ``We are very interested in moving forward
with that discussion, but (Migden's) bill was not the way to do
that.''
</P>
<P>
   Davis said he believes the matter should be reviewed in three to
five years, and he signed a bill creating a commission to further
study the issues surrounding sales tax and the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   The nine-member ``California Commission on Tax Policy in the New
Economy'' will make recommendations to the governor and Legislature
on tax issues. It will include representatives of business, local
government and the public at large.
</P>
<P>
   ``State and federal responses to taxation and the Internet over
the past few years have been awfully narrow and, as a result,
controversial,'' said the bill's author, Sen. John Vasconcellos,
D-Santa Clara.
</P>
<P>
   In his veto of the Migden bill, Davis said he did not want to
single out Internet companies.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Internet must be subject to a stable and nondiscriminatory
legal environment, particularly in the area of taxation,'' he said.
``Unfortunately, AB 2414 does not provide such a stable
environment: it singles out companies that are conducting
transactions electronically and attempts to impose tax collection
obligations on them.''
</P>
<P>
   But Migden and supporters of the bill say the governor missed
the substance of the bill.
</P>
<P>
   ``That is flat-out, plum wrong,'' Migden said Monday. ``This
measure is only about obeying existing law and making sure that we
all live by the same rules. The governor and some business people
favor making exceptions.''
</P>
<P>
   Lenny Goldberg, the lobbyist for the Northern California
Independent Booksellers, said the bill was meant to target the few
companies that violate current law.
</P>
<P>
   ``It would have told a handful of businesses that they had to
follow the law,'' he said. ``I'm not surprised it was made out to
be a bigger deal than that. It was a question of substance versus
the symbolism, and Davis reacted to the symbolism.''
</P>
<P>
   Although the federal government and dozens of states are
considering taxing the Internet, officials in Migden's office said
her bill was the first attempt to enforce sales tax collection by
dot-coms.
</P>
<P>
   Currently, some e-tailers like Barnesandnoble.com and
Borders.com do not charge California sales tax because their
Internet subsidiaries are based outside the state.
</P>
<P>
   But other online retailers _ such as Macys.com and
EddieBauer.com _ do charge state sales tax because they do not use
separate, out-of-state subsidiaries to operate their online
businesses.
</P>
<P>
   The discrepancy stems from a 1992 U.S. Supreme Court ruling that
requires merchants to collect sales tax only in states where they
have a physical presence or `nexus.'
</P>
<P>
   In the past, Borders and Barnes &AMP; Noble have said that their
stores do not constitute nexuses for their Web subsidiaries because
their Internet operations are separate.
</P>
<P>
   Bill supporters say they will continue to push to level the
playing field.
</P>
<P>
   ``This issue is not going away,'' Goldberg said. ``In the real
world of business people, the issue doesn't just disappear.''
</P>
<P>
   In other action, Davis signed two bills aimed at protecting
children:
</P>
<P>
   --Car safety seats or booster seats will be required for kids
either younger than 6 or lighter than 60 pounds.
</P>
<P>
   Currently, children must ride in safety seats until they are at
least 4 years old and also weigh at least 40 pounds.
</P>
<P>
   The new age and weight requirements take effect Jan. 1, 2002.
</P>
<P>
   --Schools must tell parents when pesticides will be used at
their children's school.
</P>
<P>
   The bill also creates a registry so parents can find out when a
pesticide is going to be applied.
</P>
<P>
   Davis vetoed a stronger bill last year because of its
requirements on how pesticides were to be used at schools.
</P>
<P>
   This year's bill contains no requirements, just the the
mandatory notification.
</P>
<P>
   The bill also requires schools to post warning signs at areas
being treated 24 hours in advance and 72 hours after a pesticide is
used.

SPORTS COLUMN: A CONTROVERSY TO RUN FROM 
</HEADLINE>
   (Eds.: Subs for rewriting throughout)  
 By HARVEY ARATON   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   SYDNEY, AUSTRALIA _ It was quite the ambitious show, with Marion
Jones standing by her tearful man, pharmacology experts supporting
his innocence and a smiling Johnny Cochran providing legal support.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know how it happened,'' said C.J. Hunter, suddenly
America's most vilified husband since the president. ``There is
nothing anyone could ever say or offer me to get me to bring shame
on the people I love. I've prayed for two years every day that if
what had to happen for my wife to win five gold medals was
something negative to me, then so be it.''
</P>
<P>
   He didn't mean a failed drug test, confirmed Monday by the
International Amateur Athletic Federation. At a news conference
here on Tuesday afternoon, Hunter denied that he had used the
anabolic steroid nandrolone. He said reports that he had tested
1,000 times over the legal limit were false. He and Team Hunter
maintained that he was only guilty of having traces of nandrolone
in his system as the result of a flawed dietetic supplement.
</P>
<P>
   A somber Jones made a brief statement, gave her man a kiss and
left him to tell the eager photographers, ``I never thought I'd see
the day when you guys would want to photograph me more than my
wife.''
</P>
<P>
   How does anyone who saw in Jones the quintessential American
star and Olympic savior last Saturday night take a second look when
she returns to the track on Wednesday without noticing a little
bloom off the rose? It will be the understandable human reaction,
given what we've heard about Hunter, her career director and
spiritual guide.
</P>
<P>
   Yet barring further announcements or IAAF outings, our editing
process between mind and mouth should be on 24-hour alert, lest we
make a leap worthy of a medal via the process of guilt by
association. Hunter is the one who must prove himself clean. Jones
can still have America's blessings as she goes for more gold.
</P>
<P>
   ``In light of the recent situation, I hope she'll be able to
continue to focus on what she's here to do,'' Michael Johnson said
in quite the statesmanlike manner after winning the men's 200
meters on Monday night in an Olympic Stadium holding more than
112,000 people. ``Hopefully, all of you will allow her to focus on
what she's here to do.''
</P>
<P>
   We as a nation have done it before, paused for reflection after
revelation, upon learning two summers ago that Mark McGwire was
hammering his way toward the baseball record book with the aid of
little bottled helpers. McGwire wasn't breaking baseball's drug
rules but that was because baseball didn't have any. He was, on the
other hand, participating and essentially promoting pharmacology,
the plague of performance enhancement, and isn't that where the
competition credibility gap in the Olympics lies?
</P>
<P>
   America wasn't ready to take down a man in the process of
rewriting the storybook of our long, lost youth, so McGwire got a
free pass, a deferred trial for when androstenedione is as widely
denounced in the States as it happens to be here.
</P>
<P>
   It has always been easier for Americans to heap scorn on
Olympians, these disposable heroes, whom we only look to every four
years. As sports ethicists, we have a shifting set of standards, a
selective morality.
</P>
<P>
   ``How can we believe anything we see here?'' is what you kept
hearing around the media center here on Monday night. Fair
question, but what shouldn't we believe _ the soccer, the
basketball, the tennis? We watch these things the rest of the year,
and we will also go home next week to watch baseball players, who
may well be mixing steroids with their crackerjack, for all we
know. No one cries to shut the parks down, but when it comes to the
Olympics, we are still demanding absolute purity from a movement
that long ago surrendered its innocence, no matter what the
mythmakers and marketers claim.
</P>
<P>
   The world has grown tired of our high mindedness, our appointed
commissions, with their how-to manuals for a kinder, cleaner
Olympics. It was delighted to have the report on Hunter leaked, to
have our drug testing program come under siege. Hunter was said to
have failed the test in Oslo not long after he passed the same
tests at the U.S. trials in July, according to U.S.A. Track and
Field's Craig Masback. The message came through loud and clear, and
was echoed on Monday by a variety of international sources: Shut up
and clean up your own house.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, the Olympics continued on Monday night, despite the
sensational news that Marion Jones' husband had joined an army of
eastern Europeans in the holding pen for drug cheats who claim the
laboratory lied.
</P>
<P>
   Cathy Freeman enthralled two nations, Australia and the
indigenous Aborigines who wallow beneath its standard of living.
Johnson ran in the shadow of others as dynamically as he had in the
spotlight of Atlanta. The American, Stacy Dragila, became the first
woman to claim pole-vaulting gold, on a night track &AMP; field managed
to soar above the sordid matters of drugs and international
backroom vendetta.
</P>
<P>
   As with many track and field stars, there have been whispers
about Marion Jones, but she isn't Michelle Smith, the swimmer who
married a doper and became a sensation overnight. Suspicion isn't
fact, and the fact is that Jones has been a blur since she was 10.
Now she has this controversy to run from, as she goes for more
gold, as her husband attempts to clear his name, not hers.

RANGERS' SHORTSTOP CLAYTON LACKING USUAL ENTHUSIASM
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By T.R. SULLIVAN 
c.2000 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   ARLINGTON, Texas _ Texas Rangers shortstop Royce Clayton admits
this has been a difficult year for him. He traces it to one simple
thing.
</P>
<P>
   Losing.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm just like everybody else in this clubhouse,'' Clayton
said. ``What's personal is our record. It's an indication of my
season. Everybody is that way. We're all here to win. We didn't do
that, and that's the bottom line.''
</P>
<P>
   Clayton said he let the losing get to him because, ``I hate to
lose, there's no doubt about that. If it doesn't bother me or if I
start to enjoy it, then that's an indication that it's time for me
to hang it up.''
</P>
<P>
   Manager Johnny Oates does not want Clayton to ``hang it up.'' He
knows Clayton has been beaten up by the losing, but Oates said most
everybody in the Rangers' clubhouse, including the manager, has
also suffered.
</P>
<P>
   Oates knows Clayton's infectious enthusiasm is an important part
of the Rangers' chemistry, and he hopes it'll come back strong next
season.
</P>
<P>
   `He's not the only one,'' Oates said. ``It's a byproduct of
losing. Losing wouldn't beat you down if you didn't care. He cares.
His enthusiasm is a big part of our ballclub, and it's gone up and
down a lot. I'd like for it to be more consistent. But I'd like for
me to be more consistent, too.
</P>
<P>
   ``What's the saying? It's not the size of the dog in the fight,
but the size of the fight in the dog. I don't think any of us enjoy
losing, but it doesn't mean you have to do it with your head down
and giving up. I don't think he has, and I don't think he has given
up.''
</P>
<P>
   Clayton signed a four-year, $18 million contract with the
Rangers after the 1998 season because he thought there was a good
chance this club could win the World Series. The Rangers won the
division title last year, but this season turned sour quickly. They
finish the season with three games at Seattle starting today and
three games against Oakland this weekend.
</P>
<P>
   ``I understand a lot of the guys like to see me walking around
the clubhouse and joking with them,'' Clayton said. ``That's part
of my nature. But sometimes you have to focus back on yourself or
you're just draining yourself. Just because we're losing doesn't
mean I'm going to drag around and pout about it.
</P>
<P>
   ``At the same time, I'm not going walk around and smile like
there's no problem and you're having a grand old time.''
</P>
<P>
   It hasn't helped that Clayton has sensed a change in the
Rangers' clubhouse from last year.
</P>
<P>
   ``For a team to be good, everybody has to be pulling for each
other,'' Clayton said. ``We had that last year. Sure, we had
talent, but we also had good chemistry and everybody pulling for
each other. It can't be just one guy.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it's fair to say that after awhile this year, it
became every man for himself. That's not the way it should be;
everybody has to support each other.''
</P>
<P>
   He tried raising that point early in the year, but it backfired
on him when he went public with his thoughts as well as complaints
about teammate Chad Curtis in an Internet column. That experience,
combined with the losing, has changed him.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are certain things I'm willing to do and certain things
I'm not willing to do,'' Clayton said. ``On the field I'm still
going to give 110 percent. I'm going to play hard. I can't play any
different. Even if we lose 120 games, I'm not going to dog it.
</P>
<P>
   ``But there are some things in my heart and soul I tried to give
and ... it caused some hard feelings and pain. I'm not willing to
endure that again when it comes to the way things are handled in
this business. I'm still going to be around and stand behind what I
believe in. That's the way I was brought up. But there's a proper
time and a certain way to do things. As far as volunteering my
opinion on topics that have nothing to do with between the lines,
I'm going to leave that alone.''
</P>
<P>
   Clayton said he still loves playing for the Rangers, and Oates
said he's still more than happy with his shortstop.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've won with him before, and we can win with him again,''
Oates said. ``If we put the right ballclub together, he's the right
guy for us. He's a very good defensive shortstop and a
complementary offensive player.''
</P>
<P>
   Clayton said: ``I'm still dedicated to helping us win. That's
all you can be and that's all you can ask of anybody in this
clubhouse. What makes me smile is winning ballgames. It's not about
what kind of year you have; it's about what you're doing to help
the team win.'' nn

   POVERTY-POLITICS (Undated) _ Poor people learn to keep hopes
small. So when President Clinton came calling on some of the
poorest places in the country last year with ideas to make things
better, it was like rain in the desert. The president's six-state,
four-day poverty tour, highlighting for the first time in his two
terms the places that remain untouched by the longest economic boom
in this nation's history, caused an excitement that bordered on the
spiritual. A year later, the president's modest proposals for tax
incentives to bring businesses to impoverished communities are
still awaiting Senate approval. The idea that anything big might
happen to places that have been down longer than they were ever up
has long faded. In dozens of interviews in communities that the
president visited _ Clarksdale, East St. Louis and the Eastern

Democrats are Democrats, Republicans are Republicans and people are

L.A.'S MTA STRIKE MAY SACRIFICE VALLEY TRANSIT ZONE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By TROY ANDERSON 
c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News 
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Questions were raised about the role of state
Assemblyman Herb Wesson in brokering a deal to end the 10-day MTA
strike because of his support for legislation that effectively
kills a San Fernando Valley transit zone.
</P>
<P>
   As a news blackout over negotiations between the Metropolitan
Transportation Authority and the drivers union continued, Wesson's
ability to fairly intervene in the dispute was challenged by some
Valley transit zone supporters.
</P>
<P>
   Wesson's supporters, meanwhile, defended the Los Angeles
Democrat's ability to be impartial but they acknowledged he hopes
to use his prominent role as a steppingstone to becoming Assembly
speaker.
</P>
<P>
   Sources close to the negotiations say both sides are refusing to
settle the strike before Gov. Gray Davis decides whether to veto or
sign into law Senate Bill 1101, extending MTA contract provisions
to a Valley zone proposed to take over dozens of MTA bus lines. By
law, Davis has until Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   Valley attorney David W. Fleming, a member of the interim board
planning the Valley Transportation Zone, said Monday the
negotiations are a question of who caves in first -- Davis, the MTA
or the unions.
</P>
<P>
   ``So far the governor has held firm,'' Fleming said. ``But
obviously these negotiations put the interest of the people in the
San Fernando Valley in jeopardy since the union wants to control
the Valley the same way they control the rest of the area.
</P>
<P>
   ``Obviously, the Valley is being held hostage to a settlement
here,'' he said. ``If the last straw to a settlement is to sell out
the Valley, believe me, we'll be sold.''
</P>
<P>
   The United Transportation Union, representing 4,300 bus and rail
drivers, went on strike Sept. 16 after rejecting the MTA's proposal
for controlling costs, including overtime. The agency said it faces
a $438 million operating deficit over the next 10 years unless it
cuts costs or raises fares.
</P>
<P>
   The strike has stranded about 450,000 weekday riders who depend
on the MTA.
</P>
<P>
   Drivers said they are on strike to protect middle-class jobs,
and say they need SB 1101 to protect workers' gains. Wesson was
among Democratic lawmakers who voted for the bill.
</P>
<P>
   ``The unions have indicated they will settle if Davis will sign
the legislation so he'll probably sign it,'' Fleming said. ``One
way or the other, the probabilities are the Valley transit zone
will be stabbed in the back.''
</P>
<P>
   Wesson was not available for comment Monday, an aide said.
</P>
<P>
   Former Assembly Speaker Antonio Villaraigosa, D-Los Angeles,
said Wesson has the respect of his former boss, MTA Board
Chairwoman Yvonne Brathwaite Burke, as well as the unions.
</P>
<P>
   ``Respect and trust are essential attributes for anyone who
wants to mediate issues as contentious as this one,'' said
Villaraigosa, who is an L.A. mayoral candidate. ``He also has a
patience about him that is important for efforts like this one when
the parties are entrenched in their positions.''
</P>
<P>
   Villaraigosa said Wesson is the second-leading Assembly
Democratic fund-raiser behind Speaker Bob Hertzberg and many people
see him as the next potential speaker of the Assembly.
</P>
<P>
   Darry Sragow, chief strategist for Assembly Democratic
Campaigns, said Wesson has raised and contributed about $400,000 to
Democratic races this year.
</P>
<P>
   ``I agree that many people see Herb Wesson as having a good shot
at being the next speaker. Certainly, they will be looking at this
to see if he has the skills for the job,'' Sragow said. ``I believe
that no matter what happens with the mediation, he will prove he
does.''
</P>
<P>
   Also on Monday, the governor said he hopes the strike will end
within days.
</P>
<P>
   In Northridge to sign legislation on pesticide use at schools,
Davis said state officials are doing everything in their power to
help negotiators ``so they can resolve this dispute in the next day
or two.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We're doing everything we can to persuade, nudge and cajole
the parties to be reasonable,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   A spokesman said Davis has not decided whether to sign or veto
SB 1101. ``The bill will be decided based solely on its merits,''
said Davis spokesman Byron Tucker.
</P>
<P>
   Richard Katz, co-chairman of the Valley Industry and Commerce
Association's transportation committee, said he's known Wesson for
years and believes his vote for SB 1101 will not bias his role in
the negotiations.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think that compromises his ability to resolve the
strike,'' Katz said.
</P>
<P>
   ``He doesn't have the ability to unilaterally impose anything.
What he can do is choose to make suggestions. Anything he comes up
with still has to be approved by the board of the MTA and union
membership.''
</P>
<P>
   Villaraigosa said Wesson will be fair.
</P>
<P>
   ``Not only do I think he can be fair, but both sides agree or
they won't have accepted him as a mediator,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Paul Hefner, press deputy to Hertzberg, said the speaker
believes Wesson will not be biased.
</P>
<P>
   ``Obviously, Mr. Wesson's role is not to take sides but to help
the parties and gather the facts in terms of helping to frame the
issues,'' Hefner said. ``So certainly, Mr. Hertzberg has every
confidence in Mr. Wesson's ability.''
</P>
<P>
   Hefner said the speaker chose Wesson because of his extensive
experience in city and county government. Wesson served as chief of
staff to Burke -- who is a county supervisor as well as MTA board
chairwoman -- for six years prior to his election to the Assembly
in 1998.
</P>
<P>
   ``He is excellent in terms of issues and organization,'' Burke
said. ``He was a good campaign manager and a hard worker. I think
he's going to move up fast. And a lot of people are saying he'll
probably be the next speaker.''
</P>
<P>
   Hertzberg's spokesman called Wesson ``uniquely qualified'' to
head the fact-finding panel.
</P>
<P>
   ``You know Burke has played a central role in the management
side of the negotiations,'' Hefner said.
</P>
<P>
   ``(Wesson) is also well-trusted and well-received by folks in
the labor community. That made him uniquely qualified to take on
this role.''

</P>
<P>
   (Viking, $24.95)
</P>
<P>
   ``I am not very successful as a little girl,'' Karr wrote in her
diary when she was 11. ``When I grow up, I will probably be a
mess.'' But look at the stories she has to tell. This sequel to her
acclaimed 1995 memoir, (beginitalic)The Liars' Club(enditalic),
takes her from a scrappy adolescent to a bored and rebellious
teenager about to leave for California with a truck full of boys,
her ticket out of the dreary Texas refinery town that had held her
captive for so long. Though she tries to make us think otherwise,
Karr's life in this book has an air of stability. Both parents are
finally under one roof for good (Karr's mother was married seven
times, twice to Mary's father), and her adolescent longings are not
so different from those of a thousand other girls. But if it's less
harrowing than (beginitalic)The Liars' Club(enditalic), its appeal
is the same: Karr is a born storyteller. Mary's voice is funny,
irreverent, profane, defiant and irresistible. And just think.
She's in her 40s. There might be more memoirs to come.

   He called her things like ``Nancy Pants'' and ``Nancy Poo'' and
``First Mommie'' in his letters, and they are so guileless and
unabashedly adoring that it seems almost voyeuristic to read them.
Over the years she kept them in a shopping bag, of all things, and
when Alzheimer's disease began to destroy his memory and his
ability to write anything at all, she took the letters out and
found solace in them. Now Nancy Reagan has written a biography of
her marriage and sprinkled it with her husband's letters. Many are
reproduced as he wrote them, some on White House stationary. The
book ends with a photograph of the couple on his birthday in
February, and with her thoughts on seeing her husband through this
last, difficult chapter of his life. Alzheimer's is truly a long
goodbye, she writes, ``but it's the living out of love.'' Royalties
will go to the Alzheimer's Foundation and to the Ronald Reagan
Library and Museum. To read a letter from the book, log on to azcen

   ``I don't have a title yet, or even a subject,'' a young man
tells his publisher. ``All I have is the price: twenty-three
ninety-five in hardcover.'' An agent gives his happy client the
news that ``Oprah is definite, Barnes and Noble is giving you front

her husband that ``you may very well be from Mars, but the children
and I are from Westchester.'' And Charles Dickens squirms as an
editor waves the first page of his manuscript and says, ``I wish
you would make up your mind, Mr. Dickens. Was it the best of times
or was it the worst of times? It could scarcely have been both.''

</P>
<P>
   By Edward Kanze
</P>
<P>
   (Sierra Club, $25)
</P>
<P>
   This was their plan: They would have no plan. Inspired by the
writings of Ralph Waldo Emerson (''The health of the eye seems to
demand a horizon.'') to dump their dreary office jobs and travel
unfettered, and drawn to Australia by Kanze's recurrent dream about
kangaroos, they pulled up stakes and followed their noses. Kanze
and his wife were naturalists. Setting out to make the acquaintance
of Australia's wildlife, they met up with monitor lizards, snakes,
crocodiles and quicksand, as well as some friendlier natural
wonders. They spent nine months driving around the country. That's
a lot of Australia for readers to absorb, but our appetite for it
is big right now. And Kanze? He overplays his role as a latter-day
Odysseus, but there's something engaging about a man who deplanes
in Melbourne and says to his wife, ``We're not in Kansas anymore.''
And what do you know, he's still dreaming about kangaroos.

   NEW ORLEANS _ A fisherman found Marilyn Allen's half-naked body
on the morning of Sept. 20, 1992.
</P>
<P>
   She had been tossed hours earlier into a lake in Camp Pendleton,
a Marine Corps base in Southern California. Authorities said she'd
been murdered, but they weren't sure how. The 30-year-old woman,
who was rumored to be a prostitute, left behind a husband, three
young daughters and dozens of unanswered questions.
</P>
<P>
   It wasn't an easy case from the start. The water seemed to have
swallowed all clues. In 1994, the investigation was shelved and for
years afterward, Allen's killing remained unsolved.
</P>
<P>
   But the case that began with a corpse in California in 1992
finally ended in Louisiana this year, with the arrest in February
of Roosevelt Bernard Gipson II, 28, of Baton Rouge. Gipson, a
former Marine lance corporal, is expected to stand trial for
Allen's killing early next year.
</P>
<P>
   What did it take to solve the mystery? An off-duty New Orleans
police lieutenant working undercover, a dedicated investigator with
a little-known but highly praised federal agency, and an operation
code-named Jambalaya.
</P>
<P>
   Only now are the details of the undercover operation being made
public. Last week New Orleans Police Lt. Jeff Winn, a Marine
reservist, was honored here with a Meritorious Service Medal by the
Marine Corps for risking his own life to solve the mystery of
Allen's death.
</P>
<P>
   Standing next to him was Naval Criminal Investigative Service
Special Agent D'Wayne Swear, the investigator who completed the
work started eight years ago, and Winn's best friend.
</P>
<P>
   Because Allen's body was found on a Marine base, her murder fell
under the jurisdiction of the NCIS, the only federal agency with a
cold-case homicide squad. Its motto: ``To the living we owe
respect; to the dead we owe the truth.''
</P>
<P>
   Solving the Allen case would be the squad's 29th success since
its founding, in 1995.
</P>
<P>
   ``We'll go to the end of the Earth, literally,'' NCIS
communications director Larry Jackson said. ``It may take many,
many years, but we're going to dedicate the assets necessary.''
</P>
<P>
   In 1999, NCIS decided it needed a cold-case investigator in the
New Orleans area. Swear, who was already an NCIS special agent, was
its first choice. A former Jefferson Parish sheriff's deputy who
signed on with NCIS in 1985, Swear, 42, is a bear of a man, more
than 6 feet tall with a linebacker's build.
</P>
<P>
   In most murder cases, including the Allen investigation, the
first 48 to 72 hours are ``absolutely crucial'' to solving the
crime, Jackson said.
</P>
<P>
   But the cold-case squad has been handed homicides that took
place more than 30 years ago. That means they need to try a new
tack.
</P>
<P>
   ``In old cases, actually, time becomes our friend,'' Jackson
said.
</P>
<P>
   Over time, he explained, relationships change. Loyal lovers and
friends may not be as faithful a few years after the crime.
Sometimes the strain of hiding the crime actually ends the
relationship, he said. Cold-case investigators also have the
leisure to study suspects' behavior patterns in the crime's
aftermath.
</P>
<P>
   Frequently, Jackson said, ``people who have gotten away with
murder are unable to live with themselves.'' Those with a trained
eye can follow a trail of broken relationships or job instability.
</P>
<P>
   A former girlfriend pointed investigators toward Gipson. In
1997, the woman told Baton Rouge police that her ex-boyfriend had
confessed to strangling a woman, placing her in the trunk of his
car, and driving around for several hours before dumping the body
in the lake at Camp Pendleton.
</P>
<P>
   NCIS and the FBI promptly reopened the Allen murder case, but
within a few months the trail again went cold. Allen's murderer was
still free.
</P>
<P>
   The following year, NCIS special agent Julie Haney decided to
give the Allen case a third look, on the chance that the evolving
technology of DNA evidence would prove useful. She tried to track
down the physical evidence, only to find it had been destroyed.
Eventually she found a medical examiner who had saved a single cell
from Allen's autopsy.
</P>
<P>
   That scrap of DNA gave Haney hope. Haney thought that if she
could find the car Gipson drove in 1992, she could find trace
evidence in the trunk proving Allen had lain there. For months, she
tried to locate the car. She failed.
</P>
<P>
   Allen had been dead for seven years.
</P>
<P>
   &LR;  Only one stratagem remained to Haney: going directly to the
chief suspect and trying to coax incriminating information from him
_ a risky ploy at best and, in obvious ways, a dangerous one.
</P>
<P>
   Haney contacted Swear, NCIS' man in southeast Louisiana.
</P>
<P>
   Locating Gipson was no great challenge. The Louisiana State
Police Intelligence Unit found him working as a maintenance man at
a business in the Baton Rouge area.
</P>
<P>
   Swear decided an undercover operation, one that placed an agent
side-by-side with Gipson, would be the best way to get what he was
after. But first, he turned to NCIS experts for a psychological
profile of Gipson.
</P>
<P>
   NCIS set to work. Soon, they knew what kind of movies he liked,
that he was angry toward women but loved his own children, that he
was an avid weightlifter, and that, though only 5 feet, 10 inches
tall, he had bulked up from 145 pounds in his Marine days to 220
pounds.
</P>
<P>
   And the one thing Gipson was most proud of, Swear learned, was
his service in the Marine Corps.
</P>
<P>
   ``The best thing in this guy's life was being a Marine,'' Swear
said. ``Marines are very proud. It's a very close group of men and
women and not everyone can earn that.''
</P>
<P>
   Now the challenge was finding an undercover agent Gipson could
relate to. Over dinner one night with Winn, Swear began thinking
out loud.
</P>
<P>
   ``I said, `I'm looking for a guy to do XYZ,' and that little
light came on and I realized I'm looking at him,'' Swear said.
</P>
<P>
   Winn, he said, ``reeks Marine, and I mean that in a good way. We
knew the Marine Green bond would bring them together and it would
take off from there.''
</P>
<P>
   Winn, 38, said his first thought was, ``I'm too old for that.''
Gipson was 10 years his junior.
</P>
<P>
   Winn had another concern. He'd gone undercover numerous times
during his 15-year police career and he knew how taxing it could
be. But what convinced him, he said, was thinking about Allen's
three daughters.
</P>
<P>
   ``They were little kids when she got killed and I think the
oldest is about 17 now,'' Winn said. ``We had a chance to resolve
this thing for her and her family.''
</P>
<P>
   Going undercover, Winn said, is a lot like acting, in that
``you've got to be able to play a role convincingly enough to prove
you are who you say you are.''
</P>
<P>
   Winn's character in this drama was a former Marine staff
sergeant going through a bad divorce. Staff sergeant was a cut
above gunnery sergeant, the rank Winn had achieved during his
Marine years, but he and Swear wanted Gipson to view Winn as a
father figure and thought the elevated rank would help.
</P>
<P>
   To rehearse his role, Winn watched videos of Marine Corps movies
and pored over big coffee-table books of Marines in action.
</P>
<P>
   Then there was pretending to be a maintenance worker.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm a terrible handyman,'' Winn said. ``You need something
destroyed, ask me. You need something fixed, ask my wife.''
</P>
<P>
   But by far the greatest challenge, Winn said, was becoming ``a
dirt bag,'' a bitter and raging woman-hater. Like Gipson, Winn's
character needed to be full of anger, much of it directed at the
imaginary wife, who had forced him to leave the military and who
was playing custody games with their children.
</P>
<P>
   ``I played up the fact that I was having a hard time with
women,'' the happily married Winn said. ``(Gipson) bad-mouthed
women all the time. Some moments, he was tender as could be but for
the most part he felt (women) needed to be punished.''
</P>
<P>
   Last January, Winn and Swear moved their operation, called
Jambalaya by their Washington-based bosses, to Baton Rouge.
</P>
<P>
   Evidently, Winn played his part well: Gipson quickly warmed up
to him. They talked Marine Corps, and soon Gipson was asking Winn
to join him in a small-scale drug dealing operation. Despite all of
the surveillance Gipson had been under, no one knew he was selling
marijuana and steroids.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; (OPTIONAL TRIM BEGINS) &LR;
</P>
<P>
   ``That caused more problems,'' Swear said. Specifically, Swear
worried about security, as narcotics dealers are always checking up
on the people around them. Winn and Swear began changing hotels or
apartments every night.
</P>
<P>
   During the day, Winn worked an eight-hour shift with Gipson.
Mornings were when they had the most time to bond. A few days into
the operation, Gipson removed a bloodied Band-Aid from his thigh,
and injected the exposed flesh with what Winn assumed were
steroids. That night Winn retrieved the Band-Aid from the trash
where Gipson had thrown it and took the stained scrap back to
Swear.
</P>
<P>
   ``Being a keen investigator and not knowing all the evidence
they had, he got the bloody Band-Aid in anticipation of DNA
testing,'' Swear said.
</P>
<P>
   Day by day, Gipson's trust in Winn seemed to grow. Winn was
ready to tighten the noose. He and NCIS experts had identified six
hot-button topics that might provoke Gipson to self-revealing
outbursts.
</P>
<P>
   ``You have to be real careful with what you say. You're trying
to get somebody to admit to committing a murder,'' Winn said. ``The
further you got, the more buttons you had to push, the more
dangerous it gets.
</P>
<P>
   ``I got to button two or three before I got the whole data
dump.''
</P>
<P>
   &UR; (OPTIONAL TRIM ENDS) &LR;
</P>
<P>
   Winn had been wearing a microphone and recording device for
days, but he wasn't sure the tape was rolling the day Gipson told
him he'd killed a woman in California in 1992. When he met Swear
that night, Winn handed him the cassette. They sat down to listen
and the confession was crystal clear.
</P>
<P>
   But the operation wasn't over. Instead of pulling Winn out, the
two investigators decided to develop a drug case against Gipson.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're from Louisiana. We go fishing. We don't throw nothing
back,'' Swear said.
</P>
<P>
   After another week and a half, Winn was ``arrested'' by
Louisiana State Police for nonpayment of child support. The next
time he saw Gipson was two weeks later, on Feb. 23. That's the day
Gipson was arrested in a store parking lot and local television
stations broadcast his sullen walk into the East Baton Rouge Parish
Lock-Up. He was charged with drug dealing in Louisiana and homicide
in California.
</P>
<P>
   Under interrogation, Gipson admitted both crimes, Swear said. He
knew Allen, he said, and he'd killed her during an argument over
money. Gipson was extradited to California in July.
</P>
<P>
   Marilyn Allen's family called officers at Camp Pendleton after
they learned of Gipson's arrest. Her father said he'd long believed
his daughter's killer would never be caught. Allen's husband,
though estranged from her at the time of her killing, asked that
someone ``give Special Agent Swear a hug'' from him and his three
daughters. Swear said he still gets emotional thinking about that.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's why we do it,'' he said. ``We do it for the kids. We do
it for the families. It's nice to give them closure.''

   FORT POLK, La. _ A humid darkness has settled and cicadas are
chorusing when the Army's new high-tech soldiers hurtle down out of
the sky: paratroopers wearing miniature computers with digital
satellite communications and pop-down eyepiece screens, gripping
assault weapons equipped with infrared and video sights.
</P>
<P>
   Out there in the black night, men wait with primitive weapons to
kill them.
</P>
<P>
   The experimental techno-warriors fight with blank rounds but
deadly purpose. Their aim: to help infantrymen survive the next
encounter with the kind of bloody chaos that killed 18 elite
soldiers in America's most recent battle experience, seven years
ago in Somalia.
</P>
<P>
   The Army hopes that men linked with digital technology will be
able to fight faster, smarter _ and safer. Information, Army
leaders assert, is the most precious weapon on the 21st century
battlefield.
</P>
<P>
   Skeptics within the Army, meanwhile, hold that no technology can
banish the chaos of battle. An Army with its eyes glued to computer
screens, some fear, will lose the instincts and skills needed to
prevail. Some dismiss the Army's antenna-festooned techno-warriors
as ``bug men.''
</P>
<P>
   Seconds after they hit the ground, two of the high-tech bug men
are killed by an enemy sniper.
</P>
<P>
   Score: chaos 2, technology 0.
</P>
<P>
   That tally will even up later during 11 days of fierce war games
in which units of the 82nd Airborne Division and the 10th Mountain
Division take on a no-tech but determined battalion of the 509th
Airborne Infantry, all to test the new technology at this sprawling
facility.
</P>
<P>
   It will take the Army months to fully analyze the results.
</P>
<P>
   But as 4,000 grimy and exhausted troops lit celebratory cigars
and swapped war stories at the mock conflict's end, this much was
clear: While digital technology can deliver immense battlefield
advantages, the ultimate outcome of America's next clash with a
chaotic world will ride, as always, on GI grit, skill and courage.
</P>
<P>
   ``The technology is not the hard part, it's the people,'' said
Col. Mark O'Neill, staff chief of the 10th Mountain Division.
</P>
<P>
   ``The hardest part of this is the soldier, the average American
kid who's been asked to go out and make difficult decisions fast,
when he's tired, cold, hungry, wet and scared.''
</P>
<P>
   Despite such misgivings, battlefield commanders here found the
technology holds huge potential.
</P>
<P>
   At its heart are digital satellite communications linked into a
tactical computer network. The system can track each individual or
vehicle and display it on a computer-generated map. A glance at the
screen shows a commander, and every other soldier with a receiver,
where all his men are. The screen also shows what's known about the
enemy's positions.
</P>
<P>
   Scouts can e-mail their reports back to headquarters rather than
repeat the information on static-blasted radios. Commanders can
e-mail changes in orders rather than assemble their unit leaders
for a map conference.
</P>
<P>
   One enthusiastic convert is Col. Bryan K. Stephens, who led a
tricky nighttime assault into a mock city of 26 multistory
buildings where the enemy was dug in behind roadblocks and
barricades.
</P>
<P>
   ``The technology helped tremendously keeping us together as we
moved into the attack,'' said Stephens, who commands the 10th
Mountain Division's 1st Brigade.
</P>
<P>
   In the dark and confusion, he said, ``I could see the lead
elements of my three battalions constantly, without having to stop
and call them on the radio.
</P>
<P>
   ``That left me able to focus more on fighting the battle,''
Stephens said. Once his men got into the city, ``then it was basic
soldiering skills _ bayonet stuff.''
</P>
<P>
   The Army's push to adapt digital technology to the battlefield
springs in part from its chilling experience in Mogadishu Oct. 3
and 4, 1993. Army Rangers and Delta Force commandoes had stormed
into the Somali capital to seize a handful of warlords.
</P>
<P>
   Intended as a lightning strike, the raid bogged down in a
pitched battle with Somali mobs who shot down two helicopters and
trapped the U.S. troops under withering fire.
</P>
<P>
   A key problem quickly emerged: No one could tell, in the city's
mazed alleyways and unmarked back streets, where they were, where
their buddies were, where the bad guys were.
</P>
<P>
   Infuriated, humiliated and vastly outnumbered, the elite
soldiers watched the combat advantage slide over to an untrained
mob of largely teen-agers armed with castoff, primitive weapons and
little or no training.
</P>
<P>
   Bullet-riddled U.S. convoys trying to bring in reinforcements
and ferry out the wounded got hopelessly lost. Trucks and Humvees
slick with the blood of the dead and dying crashed into ambush
after ambush, while commanders in helicopters overhead futilely
bawled out conflicting directions, according to Rangers' accounts
of the battle.
</P>
<P>
   They finished the mission, bringing out as prisoners the
warlords they'd gone in for. But the price was awful: 18 American
dead and more than half the assault force wounded. Three days
later, President Clinton announced that American troops would be
withdrawn from Somalia.
</P>
<P>
   That experience spurred the Army to tackle a problem that has
bedeviled commanders since warfare began: ``Where am I? Where are
my buddies? Where are the bad guys?''
</P>
<P>
   The Army has experimented with putting computers aboard tanks
and helicopters. But it wasn't until earlier this year that the
digital revolution reached foot soldiers _ Stephens' brigade and
some units of the 82nd Airborne Division.
</P>
<P>
   The impact was impressive.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've always fought off a folded paper map, and I'd be on the
radio all the time going, `Where are you? Where is Alpha
Company?''' said Stephens. One-third of his unit's radio
communications, he found, involved ``where are you?'' questions.
</P>
<P>
   Computers enabled the troops to work faster and more
efficiently.
</P>
<P>
   The airborne troopers landing on that pitch-black drop zone, for
instance, could see each other on their pop-down eyepiece computer
screens. Normally, it takes hours for paratroopers to regroup after
a night jump has scattered them. This time, they said, it took
minutes.
</P>
<P>
   And when two of them fell to sniper fire, officers said, a third
paratrooper used his experimental long-range thermal rifle sight to
pick out the sniper on a drop zone crowded with paratroopers, and
felled him with one 300-meter shot.
</P>
<P>
   Knowing precisely where everybody is enables commanders to move
units faster. And faster, for today's Army, is critical.
</P>
<P>
   When American ground forces rush into action, the first to
arrive are the lightly armed infantry. And they may be the only
ones sent. Lacking heavy armor and almost always outnumbered, they
survive and win by being quicker than the enemy, protecting
themselves by surprising and shocking the bad guys.
</P>
<P>
   When they get bogged down, as they did in Mogadishu, they're in
trouble.
</P>
<P>
   ``Digitized'' soldiers can keep their bearings in difficult
conditions, on stormy nights or in jungles or crowded city
neighborhoods. They can maintain pressure on a foe, rather than
stopping to figure out where they are. And after the confusion of
battle, they can reorganize quickly to pursue the enemy.
</P>
<P>
   ``Digitizing ground units does not revolutionize land warfare,''
Col. Dan Bolger, commander of an infantry brigade in South Korea,
wrote in a recent essay in the book ``Digital War.''
</P>
<P>
   ``But it gives an edge to the guy who has the technology and
knows how to trust and use the stuff. In a game of inches, we'll
take a few however we can get them,'' Bolger said.
</P>
<P>
   Sometimes it's a matter of more than inches.
</P>
<P>
   One night during the war game, Lt. Col. Kurt Fuller leads his
battalion in an assault on the small, enemy-held town of Huffton,
within the sprawling Fort Polk complex. The ``enemy'' forces have
no computers but, like the mobs in Mogadishu, know the local
terrain intimately.
</P>
<P>
   It's a hard fight and his unit suffers heavy casualties, but it
eventually captures the town.
</P>
<P>
   Then Fuller discovers the enemy is holding a second town several
miles away. His men pile back into trucks equipped with the
position-locating computers and tear off cross-country with none of
their customary planning and rehearsals.
</P>
<P>
   Fuller, monitoring their progress on his computer screen,
``steers'' them in a coordinated attack, advising one or the other
unit to slow down or speed up.
</P>
<P>
   They attack simultaneously from different directions, catching
the enemy off guard. They easily take the town.
</P>
<P>
   ``We never could have done that without this computer stuff,''
Fuller said later. ``We'd have been stopping every few minutes,
getting out of our vehicles, getting out the maps and our
flashlights and getting on the radio and saying, `I think I am
here, where are you, over?' It would have taken us hours.
</P>
<P>
   ``With this new stuff we just bombed on down the road and went
into the attack, and they were taken totally by surprise.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, senior commanders are cautious, and many are innately
suspicious of any over-reliance on gizmos.
</P>
<P>
   ``Technology is important but it's the least important part'' of
a successful military force, said Robert Killebrew, a veteran
paratrooper, Vietnam veteran and retired Army strategist.
</P>
<P>
   ``North Vietnam,'' he said pointedly, ``had no technology.''
</P>
<P>
   &UR; (OPTIONAL TRIM BEGINS) &LR;
</P>
<P>
   One potential problem is the difficulty of portraying today's
enemies on the computer screen. Tank formations, artillery
positions, ammunition dumps and troop quarters all can be observed
by satellite or unmanned spy planes, the data downloaded and
displayed as icons on everyone's computer.
</P>
<P>
   But how would the system have handled that disorganized mob in
Mogadishu? They ``were not soldiers in civilian disguise _ they
were real civilians,'' observed Larry Seaquist, a retired Navy
battleship skipper who is now a national security analyst in
Washington.
</P>
<P>
   From Kosovo to Sierra Leone to East Timor, most of today's
conflicts are not fought with regular, identifiable military units
easily portrayed as computer icons.
</P>
<P>
   Critics are mindful of a sobering lesson from Vietnam: The
computers of then-Defense Secretary Robert McNamara relentlessly
digested detailed statistics from the field and churned out a
steady stream of charts and graphs that showed, precisely but
wrongly, that the United States was winning the war.
</P>
<P>
   More recently, the Defense Department said after the 1999 air
war against Serbia that its remote sensors showed 120 tanks, 220
armored personnel carriers and 450 artillery pieces were destroyed
by U.S. and NATO bombing. Neutral observers on the ground reported
after the war that less than a dozen tanks were destroyed; the
others were decoys.
</P>
<P>
   For these reasons, many officers are cautiously enthusiastic
about relying on information-age technology.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think we can get to near-perfect at knowing where we're at,
and maybe to `pretty good' at knowing where the enemy is,'' said
Lt. Col. Vance Nannini, who commands an artillery battalion in the
10th Mountain Division.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's better than the `OK' that we deal with today. Frankly,
a lot of times we guess.''
</P>
<P>
   &UR; (OPTIONAL TRIM ENDS) &LR;
</P>
<P>
   During one night attack here, Lt. Col. Fuller was just about to
launch his battalion when his computers went dead.
</P>
<P>
   ``Just burned up,'' Fuller said later. ``We had to do the
old-fashioned map-and-flashlight drill.''
</P>
<P>
   Rather than maintaining safe distance between the cavalry unit
in front of him, Fuller's battalion kept running into the cav's
rear units. The confusion blunted their attack and caused
additional casualties.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a mess,'' he said in disgust.
</P>
<P>
   Sgt. Tom Rogers also was supposed to take his squad of combat
engineers into an attack right behind the cavalry scouts. But the
electronics weren't working right and they got separated from the
column. Rogers, an experienced leader, quickly assessed the
situation and put his men into a position where they were most
needed.
</P>
<P>
   ``We fell in with a company of Marines, and we ended up killing
two BDRMs and a T-72 (Russian armored vehicles and a tank),'' he
exulted after the fight. ``Boom! Blasted those motha's!''
</P>
<P>
   Defense contractors have jumped eagerly into this technological
cornucopia. In a recent newspaper ad, Lockheed Martin, which holds
numerous Pentagon contracts to develop ``battlefield management
systems,'' showed a soldier behind a machine gun looking out into a
scary vista.
</P>
<P>
   ``Carry the right data and you carry the day,'' the ad boasted.
</P>
<P>
   But many professional soldiers reject that view, arguing that
soldier grit and battle skills are at least as critical.
</P>
<P>
   ``No matter what we do with the technology, we gotta hang on to
our core capability,'' said Fuller. ``In this light-infantry
battalion, my soldiers have to be physically fit, world-class
athletes and masters of their weapons day and night.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's what will count in the end.''

 &HT;    REFORMER URGES NEW MODEL OF COMMUNITY NURSING HOMES
 &HT;    With photos.
 &HT;    By JULIA MALONE
 &HT;    c.2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ALEXANDRIA, Va. _ The expansive country kitchen, with windows
overlooking a flowering garden and a cat curled up on a nearby
sofa, hardly looked like the dreaded image of a nursing home.
</P>
<P>
   At one table, three residents of Goodwin House made cupcakes for
children who would be making their weekly visit from a preschool
nearby.
</P>
<P>
   The retirement and nursing home complex are part of a movement
to bring more humanity, respect and companionship, as well as
animals, plants and children, into nursing facilities.
</P>
<P>
   Called the ``Eden Alternative'' after the biblical story, the
effort was founded almost a decade ago by Harvard-trained
geriatrist, William Thomas, and has spread to about 300 homes in
the United States and abroad.
</P>
<P>
   Thomas visited Capitol Hill last week to urge the federal
government, which finances most long-term care costs, to accept new
ways of caring for people.
</P>
<P>
   His latest focus is on building homes in residential
neighborhoods, where a staff, with computer hookups to a hospital
center, would provide nursing care and housekeeping for six to
eight elderly people.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is time to abolish the practice of institutionalizing our
mothers and our fathers,'' Thomas said
</P>
<P>
   But with many of the nation's 17,000 nursing homes stubbornly
resistant to change and continuing to provide substandard care,
even the irrepressible Thomas is beginning to doubt if the nation's
nursing home system can be repaired.
</P>
<P>
   ``Man, there's a long way to go,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Thomas's new proposal envisions 4,000-square-foot ranch-style
homes. The first seven of these homes, dubbed the ``Green House
Project,'' are to be built next year by the Faxton-St. Luke's
Health Care System in Utica, N.Y., as it phases out a nursing care
building.
</P>
<P>
   ``I want to create an environment where Eden-like ideas can
flourish more readily than in a 200 bed-nursing facility,'' Thomas
told a gathering. ``My heart breaks when I see how many people try
hard to make it work and are knocked down by an institutional
structure that is more powerful than they are.''
</P>
<P>
   Thomas said the new homes would cost 25 percent less per
resident to build than a standard nursing home. Staff training
costs are somewhat higher, but in the end, the new homes should be
no more expensive for clients than traditional care.
</P>
<P>
   Sheila Caswell, director of health and wellness at Goodwin
House, said it has taken years to make the transition to the Eden
system, which is largely a matter of remodeling the building and
training the staff in what she calls ``common-sense'' caring for
each person as an individual.
</P>
<P>
   For example, one resident is served oatmeal for breakfast every
day because that's what she had at her home. Meals are served on
linen tablecloths, instead of trays, in homey dining rooms. Staff
members operate as teams that include nurses, nurse assistants and
housekeeping workers, who meet together to make decisions for each
wing.
</P>
<P>
   Some studies have found mental and physical health of residents
improves in these ``Edenized'' homes.
</P>
<P>
   At Goodwin House, residents rarely have physical restraints, and
they take far fewer medications for mental disorders than nursing
home patients nationwide. Staff turnover, which is roughly 100
percent in nursing homes nationwide, is 30 percent at Goodwin
House.
</P>
<P>
   A study published last spring by Southwest Texas State
University in San Marcos tested the effects of applying the Eden
concept at five Texas facilities. Behavioral problems, bedsores,
and staff absenteeism dropped dramatically, the study found.

Problem was, he got outfoxed. (Joe Murray, Cox News Service). MOVED

 &HT;    Turn 'Empty Nest Syndrone' into a time for you and your spouse
 &HT;    By Hap LeCrone
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Recently, a reader made the following request:
</P>
<P>
   DEAR DR. LECRONE: Our last child just left yesterday for college
and my husband and I are having to deal with an empty nest. For
many years, four children filled our lives with their friends,
activities, joys and sorrows. Now, it is so quiet it is almost
frightening. My husband and I have a great marriage and love each
other very much. Our feelings of loss come from the change in
family structure, not a bad marriage. Can you provide us with some
helpful suggestions to make this transition easier? _ Empty nest
and hurting heart.
</P>
<P>
   Dear empty nest and hurting heart: Many of us have gone through
what you and your husband are experiencing. As you correctly
labeled this challenge facing you, you are in the process of
transition. You will probably have some good days and some bad
days, especially in the beginning. Following are some suggestions
that may help make this transition easier.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Keep the new phase of life in the proper perspective. Most
parents want their children to establish their own life. As they
walk away, be proud that they can walk alone.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Plan to spend more time with your spouse if you are married.
As one friend of mine said, ``We had a great time together before
the children came, now we're going to pick up where we left off 20
years ago.'' It can be a second honeymoon. If you are divorced,
plan to spend more time with relatives and friends.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Begin planning before the day comes. If you are a single
parent, put some new interest or study into operation before you
are completely alone. The transition will be less traumatic.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Expect some feelings of loss or even some depression, although
the passage of time is a healer in itself. Share your feelings with
someone who has been through the process. If things don't improve,
consider professional counseling.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Look to the future. This phase, too, will pass. Share in the
child's new career; think about grandchildren and future family
gatherings.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Be philosophical. Even be a little humorous. Enjoy the rest,
the peace and the quiet. These are lots of advantages of the new
lifestyle of an empty nest. You deserve each and every one of them.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Hap LeCrone is a clinical psychologist. If you have
questions or topics you would like Dr. LeCrone to discuss, write
him at 4555 Lake Shore Drive, Waco, Texas 76710 or e-mail him at

 &HT;    Dating isn't what it used to be
 &HT;    By Elizabeth Schuett
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   GIBSONBURG, Ohio _ This morning, as usual, coffee and
conversation with my retired farmer buddies began on a lofty note.
Well, maybe not quite so exalted, since we were talking politics.
Amos was saying how he wishes Lieberman would stop Bible thumping,
and Cal admits he keeps hoping for a miracle where Bush will stop
talking all over himself and say something _ almost anything.
</P>
<P>
   John Deere ballcaps nod in a wave of agreement around the table.
</P>
<P>
   Benny says he doesn't like it that Gore wears boots instead of
shoes. Amos reminds him Gore's a farmer. ``Farmer, my Aunt
Fanny!,'' Benny snorts. ``I'm a farmer and I don't go around in
shiny boots. I wear work shoes.'' That said, he kicks a Red Wing to
the edge of the table as proof. For just a minute there he looks as
if he might not be able to get it back under the table without
help. But he manages.
</P>
<P>
   Amos says, with a knowing chuckle, ``I think he wears those
boots to keep from getting snakebit.'' Benny picks up on that one
right away and explains that political snakes don't bite on the
ankles. No one argues with that.
</P>
<P>
   There's a short silence, then predictably the talk turns to what
Cal calls ``he'in and she'in.'' Ed, a widower for a couple of years
now, is mumbling something about checking out a lonely hearts club
to see if maybe he can meet
</P>
<P>
   some nice ladies who'd like to spend time with a handsome guy.
Amos asks who the handsome guy might be.
</P>
<P>
   ``Dating services,'' Benny puts in his two-cents worth. ``They
don't call `em lonely hearts any more.'' Ed asks Benny how he knows
this, being a married man and all, and Benny says it's because he
reads the papers. ``Don't you ever read that section where ladies
are looking for men and men are looking for ladies and there's
even. . .'' Benny stops, thinks it over, and then adds, ``You'd be
surprised what folks are advertising for nowadays.''
</P>
<P>
   Ed says he has a friend who joined up and met a real nice lady
he now sees a couple of times a week _ sometimes at her place and
sometimes at his. Benny raises an eyebrow and asks the obvious.
``You mean they're. . . ?''
</P>
<P>
   Ed says sure, why not. ``They're both in their 70s,'' he
explains with a laugh, ``so they sure don't have to worry about
starting a family.'' The table goes momentarily quiet while the
guys take a nostalgic moment to think this one
</P>
<P>
   over. Then a discussion begins of how difficult it would be to
go back to courting.
</P>
<P>
   Amos says he's forgotten everything he ever knew about going on
a date. Cal tells him that wasn't much, but adds, ``Heck, I
wouldn't know where to begin either. I been married 53 years.''
</P>
<P>
   Ed says dating today isn't what it used to be _ his friend has
told him all about it. ``The problem is bucket seats. And seat
belts. The ladies can't slide over and sit real close like they
used to do when we were kids. Remember
</P>
<P>
   that?'' We all smile _ we all remember.
</P>
<P>
   Cal tells how he used to pretend his hand had accidentally
slipped off the gearshift knob and right onto the lady's knee. Says
he got slapped once or twice. Amos says he used to do the same
thing . . . and Benny. . . and Ed, and all
</P>
<P>
   the rest of them. I tell them how, once I was going steady, I
used to shift gears for my boyfriend Harry when he had his right
arm around me. I recall the first time I worked up enough courage
to put my hand on his knee. We were both so surprised we almost
wrecked the car.
</P>
<P>
   Ed says that's what he misses most, the little stuff. He plants
his coffee mug on the table and tells us he's off to Toledo.
``Doctor's appointment?'' Cal asks. Ed shakes his head.
</P>
<P>
   ``First, I'm gonna' join up with the lonely hearts and then I'm
going looking for a `39 Ford with a bench seat and three on the
floor.''
</P>
<P>
   We all wish him luck _ on both counts.

 &HT;    Rah rah, Uniformity U. Stick college students with more
standardized tests?
 &HT;    By John Young
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   So, Gandhi arrives at the portal of the afterlife. A specter
with a clipboard stops him.
</P>
<P>
   ``Why the delay?'' asks Gandhi. ``Have I not lived a moral life?
Have I not fought oppression and sacrificed for mankind?''
</P>
<P>
   ``Yes, sir,'' says the attendant. ``It says here, however, you
haven't taken the algebra exit test.''
</P>
<P>
   You are entering testing purgatory.
</P>
<P>
   More and more it seems clear that a standardized test will be
the basis upon which every life is judged.
</P>
<P>
   Pick up your No. 2 pencil. Put down your Nobel Prize.
</P>
<P>
   The fixation on standardized tests in public schools has
benefits. It affixes some students' attention to basic skills they
lack. It also has drawbacks. It downshifts some Indy-car minds to
golf-cart speed.
</P>
<P>
   Now, alarmingly, the standardized impulse is tugging at certain
University of Texas regents. A ``discussion document'' is afloat
concerning standardized tests for core subjects _ math, science,
history, English, government, even fine arts _ and also in
students' majors.
</P>
<P>
   This is a response to nationwide concerns about grade inflation.
To such a pat response come faculty and student concerns about
homogenizing college education and driving up costs.
</P>
<P>
   UT Associate Vice Chancellor Joe Stafford, into whose lap this
notion has been dropped, warns against jumping to conclusions. The
initiative is still in the thinking stage.
</P>
<P>
   Stafford said the objective is some form of institutional
accountability. Whether that would take the form of standardized
tests or some other means remains to be proposed.
</P>
<P>
   When word first circulated about the proposed tests, proponents
said the idea was to rate educators and departments, rather than
students. Hmmm. A no-stakes test to gobble up a student's time? See
you down the road.
</P>
<P>
   It's clear that for students to take such tests seriously,
they'd need a little fear of God drummed into them: class credits
hinging on passing.
</P>
<P>
   Either way you've got something certain to induce much sameness
in classrooms.
</P>
<P>
   Questions, questions. How to pay for these tests? We don't know,
but we can imagine. Just stick it on a student fee list already
longer than the credits for ``Gunga Din''.
</P>
<P>
   Questions. Who would decide what test questions to ask? Teams of
UT professors, of course. Supposedly that would make things
collegial again. Suppose again.

<P>
   Questions. How to have a standardized means of assessing someone
whose major is art, music, drama or other lively arts that can't be
captured in a vial?
</P>
<P>
   Stafford agreed that such offerings seem to defy any notion of
standardized testing. But he said that doesn't mean a standardized
means of assessment couldn't be devised, say through portfolios.
</P>
<P>
   All of which begs the question. What are professors doing now?
Are they not assessing, not testing? Of course they are. That's
their job. We hire the best we can, with the expertise and the
teaching skills, and we ask them to assess based on their skills.
</P>
<P>
   In most cases, board certification or professional exams will be
the ultimate delineators for graduates. Do they need one more test?
</P>
<P>
   The state already has TASP _ the Texas Academic Skills Placement
test _ which freshmen must pass in reading, writing and math unless
they score sufficiently high on the SAT, ACT or TAAS. Obviously,
what higher education needs is more acronyms. Acronyms mean
excellence.
</P>
<P>
   If the issue is grade inflation, instead of imposing more tests
Texas could consider what Great Britain, New Zealand and Hong Kong
do: audit grading practices and classroom offerings based on a
nationally normed set of standards.
</P>
<P>
   But one more test? One more cost?
</P>
<P>
   Students would have moral standing to resist.

   KLEINBERG-COLUMN _ Howard Kleinberg says we don't need the
government to regulate the violence and sex in Hollywood's movies.
He says what's needed is a good dose of self-restraint from the
American public. (Kleinberg, Cox News Service). MOVED MONDAY.
</P>
<P>
   SCHUETT-COLUMN _ This morning, as usual, coffee and conversation
with my retired farmer buddies began on a lofty note. Well, maybe
not quite so exalted, since we were talking politics. Amos was
saying how he wishes Lieberman would stop Bible thumping, and Cal
admits he keeps hoping for a miracle where Bush will stop talking
all over himself and say something _ almost anything. (Schuett, Cox
News Service) MOVED.
</P>
<P>
   JOEMURRAY _ Column from Dreamsville: Folks in a rural community
in the middle of Oklahoma in the 1930s figured they knew who the
chicken thieves were. They just couldn't catch them. Then the
sheriff came up with a plan to nab 'em in the act in the hen house.
Problem was, he got outfoxed. (Joe Murray, Cox News Service). MOVED
MONDAY.

<P>
   YOUNG-COLUMN _ So, Gandhi arrives at the portal of the
afterlife. A specter with a clipboard stops him. ``Why the delay?''
asks Gandhi. ``Have I not lived a moral life? Have I not fought
oppression and sacrificed for mankind?'' ``Yes, sir,'' says the
attendant. ``It says here, however, you haven't taken the algebra
exit test.'' You are entering testing purgatory. (Young, Waco

   MINING-POLLUTION (San Francisco) _ Thousands of pounds of
mercury leaking from dozens of old gold mines in the Sierra Nevada
is contaminating downstream lakes and streams and triggering health
warnings on game fish. The warnings concerning tainted fish are the
first in California's historic gold mining regions, including the
Sierra and the Trinity-Klamath Mountains. By JANE KAY.
</P>
<P>
   BORDER-PATROL (El Cenizo, Texas) _ Tensions are escalating
between the U.S. Border Patrol and residents of this tiny town that
made national headlines last year after it adopted Spanish as its
official language. El Cenizo, population 1,775, has formed a
``truth commission'' to investigate allegations of human rights
abuses by Border Patrol agents here. By BONNIE PFISTER.

   ENTERTAINMENT (``e'' category)

<P>
   TEXAS-DANCE-HALL (New Braunfels, Texas) _ Gruene Hall is a
special place to anyone who has scooted across the well-worn wooden
floor. But the oldest dance hall in Texas means even more to those
who make the music. ``It's the `Austin City Limits' of dance
halls,'' country artist Charlie Robison says, comparing it to the
venerable PBS television show that spotlights Texas musicians. By
JOHN GOODSPEED.
</P>
<P>
   MUSIC-REVIEW-BUSH (San Antonio) _ Almost every song on Johnny
Bush'S latest album deals with rejection and the ways people cope
with it, from bouncing back to love again to homicidal rages.
``Lost Highway Saloon'' is the country music legend's two-year
effort to record old songs he's always loved along with carefully
chosen new ones in an album that crosses a little outside his usual
bounds of honky-tonk, Western swing and traditional country music.
By JOHN GOODSPEED.
</P>
<P>
   TV-FALL-CHANGES (Undated) _ Sally Field, the ``Flying Nun,'' is
returning to television this fall on ``ER'' and possibly another
show. Other returning shows will undergo a variety of changes this
season, which kicks off in earnest next week. By MARK McGUIRE.
</P>
<P>
   BOOKS-REVIEWS-CRIME (Undated) _ The more horses, jockeys,
racetracks and steeplechases, the more I like to read a Dick
Francis book. Unfortunately for me, ``Shattered''(G.P. Puntam's
Sons, $25.95, 289 pages) only has racing in the first chapter.
Nevertheless, Francis is in top form as a storyteller in this new

   PALM-CONVERGENCE (San Francisco) _ Plans for a hybrid mobile

</P>
<P>
   LUBY'S-CEO (San Antonio) _ The president and chief executive
officer of Luby's Inc. resigned, leaving the San Antonio-based
cafeteria chain searching for its fourth leader in five years. By

   SPORTS (``s'' category)
</P>
<P>
   FBN-OWENS (Santa Clara, Calif.) _ With steely eyes and a
furrowed brow, Steve Mariucci resembled a disappointed father
forced to mete out a painful punishment to his wayward child. But
Terrell Owens didn't lose the keys to the car or the privilege of
playing with his video games for a week. He paid a much heftier
price for his nationally televised misbehavior in Sunday's 41-24
win over Dallas. Owens has been grounded. By MICHELLE SMITH.
</P>
<P>
   RATTO-COLUMN (San Francisco) _ Terrell Owens ought to be angry
with the San Francisco 49ers. He ought to be downright livid. Not
because he was suspended for a week. That one, he has to eat. And
not because he lost $24,000 and change with the suspension. I mean,
what's money to a millionaire like him? No, the bone he has to pick
with management boils down to the fact that nobody in a position of
authority bothers to notice a new and unique touchdown celebration
any longer. I mean, what's an artist got to do? By RAY RATTO.
</P>
<P>
   BBN-GIANTS (San Francisco) _ The Giants want it all now. The
World Series or bust. If it's not a Fall Classic, in their minds,
it'll be a classic fall. After clinching the National League West
last week, the Giants made it known they wouldn't settle for
anything less than a final showdown with the New York Yankees, or
any other team the American League submits. By JOHN SHEA.

&HT;     JOHNNY BUSH'S NEWEST ALBUM IS ALL ABOUT REJECTION 
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     (ATTN: Beaumont, Houston)

<P>
   SAN ANTONIO _ Johnny Bush is making rejection an art.
</P>
<P>
   Only he's not into jilting. He's into commiserating.
</P>
<P>
   Almost every song on the country music legend's latest album
deals with rejection and the ways people cope with it, from
bouncing back to love again to homicidal rages.
</P>
<P>
   ``The idea began with, `What makes a country song?''' said Bush,
who knows a little about the genre. His career began in Houston in
1952, when he played with Ray Price and Willie Nelson and recorded
such hits as ``Undo the Right,'' ``I'll Be There,'' ``You Gave Me a
Mountain'' and ``Whiskey River,'' which he wrote and Nelson later
took as his signature song.
</P>
<P>
   ``A country song deals with real situations that people face
every day, and not necessarily cheating and drinking and running
around. But I thought it would be fun to pick out songs that show
how people handle rejection,'' said Bush, a longtime San Antonio
resident who still two-steps through the Texas dance-hall circuit.
</P>
<P>
   The result is ``Lost Highway Saloon,'' Bush's two-year effort to
record old songs he's always loved along with carefully chosen new
ones in an album that crosses a little outside his usual bounds of
honky-tonk, Western swing and traditional country music.
</P>
<P>
   Bush knows a little about rejection, too.
</P>
<P>
   At 17, he was engaged to a high school girl and working seven
days a week in the oil fields near Beaumont to save enough money to
get married. After working double shifts for time off, he went to
visit her in Houston.
</P>
<P>
   ``She dropped my engagement ring in my hand and said it's over _
that she loved a football player,'' Bush said. ``I had to drive all
the way back to Beaumont with this pain in my heart.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was too young to drink, but Lefty Frizzell and Hank Williams
sure started sounding better to me. You really don't know how much
meaning those country songs have until you're hurting, and then
they all start making sense.''
</P>
<P>
   The rejection songs include:
</P>
<P>
   ``The Same Ole Me,'' a twin-fiddle shuffle Ray Price recorded
just before Bush joined Price's Cherokee Cowboys in the early
1960s.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Wall,'' a new song by Clay Blaker of New Braunfels, who's
written songs for George Strait and Barbra Streisand. Bush's duet
with Leona Williams nails the tale about a couple going through the
motions after the flame has died.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hands Can Say A Lot Beneath the Table'' is a self-explanatory
story of a cheating wife that's a pure honky-tonker.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're Hanging Me Tonight'' shows how rejection can lead to a
violent end for everyone involved.
</P>
<P>
   ``Lost Highway Saloon'' is the first release on a new label,
Lone Star Records, which also will release ``Johnny Bush Sings Bob
Wills'' in October.
</P>
<P>
   ``What better way to start a new country label than with an
album from Johnny Bush _ one of the true legends of Texas country
music,'' said Heinz Geissler, manager of the Texas Music Group,
which oversees Austin's Lone Star Records.
</P>
<P>
   ``I like it when artists stretch a little bit, and that's what
John did here,'' Geissler said. ``I always commend artists who
don't just try to re-create what they've been doing forever.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush doesn't step that far outside the box, but when he does,
it's memorable:
</P>
<P>
   A cover of ``I'll Never Be Free,'' an early 1950s duet by
Tennessee Ernie Ford and Kaye Starr that was one of the first
crossover country hits, reaching No. 1 on the pop chart. Bush's
version with Houston singer Kate McCarthy is a love song in a
silky-smooth arrangement that proves that country is cool.
</P>
<P>
   For something really different, Bush chose the title cut of
``Lost Highway Saloon.'' The ballad is about a man stopping for a
drink in a bar reminiscent of ``Twilight Zone'' where a haunted
jukebox conjures the legends _ ``I could smell the whiskey on
Hank's breath and Patsy Cline's perfume.'' After leaving, he can
never find the bar again.
</P>
<P>
   Bush said he had been trying to write a song with the same
concept for 20 years but a young man from Dallas, Brian Burns, beat
him to it.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I heard it, it just destroyed me,'' Bush said. ``I knew
it wasn't a Johnny Bush-type song, but I had to try it.''
</P>
<P>
   Another new one for Bush is a hidden track that starts about a
minute after the last song ends.
</P>
<P>
   The Bush-McCarthy duet on ``I'll Never Be Free'' is repeated
through an electronic filter that introduces the snaps, crackles
and pops and tinny tone that replicates the sound of a 78 rpm
recording.
</P>
<P>
   Bush hopes the range and depth of the 14 songs on the album will
provide something for everyone.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's my intent to introduce new songs to my old friends and to
revive some old songs to new fans,'' Bush said.
</P>
<P>
   To that end, he finishes the album with a tour de force of
rejection, despair and redemption with the last three songs.
</P>
<P>
   In ``Pride Goes Before a Fall,'' a Leon Payne song Jim Reeves
covered in the 1960s, a man joins the winos after being rejected by
a woman.
</P>
<P>
   The next is an extension of that song, ``So This Is the Fall
(That Pride Goes Before),'' written by the late Neal Merritt and
covered by Stonewall Jackson. The same man hits rock bottom,
selling the ring she returned to buy a bottle of wine.
</P>
<P>
   ``Wine Into Water'' is a cover of T. Graham Brown's 1998 song
about an alcoholic who turns to Jesus to keep from destroying
himself and his family.
</P>
<P>
   ``So this guy's last resort, which I think should always be the
first resort if you have a problem, is to turn to the Lord and ask
him to be delivered from it,'' Bush said.
</P>
<P>
   Coming from someone with Bush's credentials, that's some advice
about rejection that shouldn't be rejected out of hand.

&HT;     OLD DANCE HALL GIVES NEW COUNTRY ALBUM A SPECIAL TWIST 
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     (Eds: Note optional trim)

<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW BRAUNFELS, Texas _ Gruene Hall is a special place to anyone
who has scooted across the well-worn wooden floor. But the oldest
dance hall in Texas means even more to those who make the music.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's the `Austin City Limits' of dance halls,'' alternative
country artist Charlie Robison said, comparing it to the venerable
PBS television show that spotlights Texas musicians. ``The first
time you get a Saturday night there, you are accepted. It means you
pass muster.''
</P>
<P>
   For Robison, his younger brother, Bruce, and Jack Ingram,
recording a live album at Gruene Hall last December was a
triumphant return to their roots.
</P>
<P>
   That effort, ``Unleashed Live,'' hit the shelves this week as a
document of the final concert in a 40-city tour in support of each
artist's album on Sony's Lucky Dog Records.
</P>
<P>
   Each selected four songs from the Gruene Hall session, and most
are from their latest albums _ Bruce Robison's ``Long Way From
Anywhere,'' Charlie Robison's ``Life Of The Party'' and Ingram's
``Hey You.''
</P>
<P>
   ``There's something that happens live that's irreplaceable in
the studio,'' Ingram said. ``You've got all these screaming people;
it's like live theater . . . it's this energy. The cool thing is
that we recorded it at Gruene Hall, where that kind of stuff was
happening that night.''
</P>
<P>
   Gruene Hall, located in a historic area of New Braunfels, a
short drive from San Antonio, was one of the first venues for the
Robisons. They began playing there _ without a cover charge _ in
the early 1990s. Ingram, a Houston native who now lives in Dallas,
started visiting Gruene Hall as a kid with his parents.
</P>
<P>
   Last year's Unleashed tour put the Robison brothers together
with their friend Ingram, whom they got to know at gigs across the
state. Since they got along well and played in a similar rocking
roadhouse style tinged with traditional country, Lucky Dog decided
on the joint tour to promote each of their albums.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were having a blast every night, going up and singing on
each other's sets,'' Charlie Robison said. ``We were ending the
tour in Texas, and the people at Sony thought it was a good idea to
record one of those shows.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Most people who love my music have an equal passion for
Charlie and Bruce, and I think it goes that way around the table,''
Ingram said. ``So that's why it was such a good tour.''
</P>
<P>
   The album kicks off with a twanging 4/4 shuffle, ``The Good
Life,'' from Bruce Robison, who lives in Austin. Charlie joins him
on the yearning ``Rayne, Louisiana'' before Bruce's wife, fellow
county artist Kelly Willis, sings a duet on the bittersweet ``Angry
All The Time.''
</P>
<P>
   Charlie Robison's contributions include ``My Hometown,'' a
coming-of-age ballad with an attitude: The crowd joins in on the
college part, ``I don't think I seen a single classroom/but I drank
a lot of beer.''
</P>
<P>
   His unnerving ``Loving County,'' about a killing a rich woman in
order to get a ring for his girlfriend, is balanced by the raucous
``Barlight,'' where a nursery rhyme becomes a rocking salute to
saloons.
</P>
<P>
   Ingram includes the no-place-like-home song ``Travis County,''
which he's never recorded but was in the movie ``Hope Floats.'' An
extended guitar riff introduces a flaming hot ``Mustang Burn,''
while ``Barbie Doll'' _ a warning about vacant blondes _ provides a
bring-the-house-down, sing-along ending.
</P>
<P>
   ``We love those guys,'' Gruene Hall owner Pat Molak said.
``Their music is so lively and they're good entertainers. We're
totally flattered to have them record that album here.''
</P>
<P>
   The dance hall was built in 1878 for the then-thriving German
farming community of Gruene. Molak revived the hall after buying it
in 1974.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a little bit of magic between the artists and the
crowd,'' he said. ``You can get pretty close to them, and there's a
lot of interaction.''

</P>
<P>
   Charlie Robison, who has moved to Sony's Colombia Records, said
his next album would be released in late December or early January.
Ingram, who will return to the studio in January, is adding a few
of the new songs to his concerts.
</P>
<P>
   Charlie Robison is scheduled to be back at Gruene Hall on Nov.
24 and Ingram will follow on Nov. 25.
</P>
<P>
   Robison said his songs on ``Unleashed Live'' are some of his
favorites because he wrote them in the town of Bandera, a stone's
throw from Gruene Hall, at a time when he was playing anywhere with
just his guitar.
</P>
<P>
   ``And now playing where we sell out weeks in advance, it's
really come full circle,'' Robison said.

&HT;     FALL TV SEASON BRINGS OLD FACES IN NEW ROLES

<P>
   If ``The Fugitive'' can return to television, why not the Flying
Nun?
</P>
<P>
   While CBS is remaking the 1960s David Janssen drama, Sister
Bertrille is not coming back. But Sally Field is returning to
television _ and maybe in more than one place.
</P>
<P>
   The Oscar-winner people really, really liked (she spoofed her
famous acceptance speech in a recent Super Bowl commercial) will
play a recurring character on ``ER'' (NBC) for six episodes
starting this fall. She will portray the mother of Abby Lockhart
(Maura Tierney).
</P>
<P>
   Field is also the target of several jokes in the premiere of
``Bette,'' the new CBS comedy in which Bette Midler plays herself.
Field's 1980 best actress Oscar for ``Norma Rae'' made Midler a
loser for ``The Rose.'' The set-up screams for a guest appearance.
</P>
<P>
   Other returning shows will undergo a variety of changes this
season, which kicks off in earnest next week. Here are some
highlights:
</P>
<P>
   _ Less Fox on Fox: David Duchovny's Fox Mulder, apparently
abducted by aliens in last year's finale of ``The X-Files'' (Fox)
will appear in only 11 episodes this season. Robert Patrick (the
shape-shifting cyborg assassin in ``Terminator 2'') teams up with
Gillian Anderson's Dana Scully.
</P>
<P>
   _ Bad boys, bad boys: Two of Hollywood's more notorious movie
actors will try to leave their troubles behind as they transition
to television. Fresh from the slammer, Robert Downey Jr. joins the
cast of ``Ally McBeal'' (Fox) for eight episodes, playing a
potential love interest for Calista Flockhart's flighty attorney.
</P>
<P>
   On ``Spin City'' (ABC), Charlie Sheen has the unenviable duty of
replacing Michael J. Fox. In a scheduling quirk, Sheen will be
going head-to-head on Wednesday nights against dad Martin Sheen of
NBC's Emmy-winner ``The West Wing.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I hope he beats the pants off of us,'' Dad said this past
summer with a shrug. ``That's fine.'' Don't count on it.
</P>
<P>
   _ The DA departs: The venerable Adam Schiff (Steven Hill)
departs the top chair in the New York County DA's Office on ``Law &AMP;
Order'' (NBC).
</P>
<P>
   In a show that's lasted 10 seasons because of regular cast
changes, Hill's departure is significant in that he is the last
remaining actor from its inaugural 1990 season (although he was not
an original cast member).
</P>
<P>
   ``It was Steven's decision,'' said Executive Producer Dick Wolf.
``Ten years on anything is an amazing run. It's the second decade
of the show.''
</P>
<P>
   Hill will be replaced by Dianne Wiest (an Oscar winner for
``Bullets Over Broadway''). ``She's brand-new in the job,'' Wolf
said. ``She won't have quite the shorthand with Sam (Waterston, who
plays Assistant DA Jack McCoy) that Steven had. There will be some
decided differences of opinion.''
</P>
<P>
   As usual, Wolf isn't distraught by the departure of a cast
member. ``In ensemble dramas there's a wear-out factor with any
original cast,'' he said. ``You have four or five seasons, and then
the audience knows everybody's moves.
</P>
<P>
   ``The audience has not only come to expect but to embrace the
character changes.''
</P>
<P>
   _ Moving on over: In what ought to be a record, three shows have
switched networks this fall: ``The Hughleys'' moved from ABC to
UPN; ``Sabrina, the Teenage Witch'' shifts from ABC to the WB, and
``The PJ's'' slides over from Fox to the WB.
</P>
<P>
   _ Paging Drs. Bayliss and Pembleton: The lead detectives of
``Homicide: Life on the Street'' have traded avenging the dead to
saving the living. Kyle Secor, who played Detective Tim Bayliss,
joins the cast of ``City of Angels'' (CBS), while Andre Braugher
(Detective Frank Pembleton) is the title character in the new ABC
hospital drama ``Gideon's Crossing.''
</P>
<P>
   ``City of Angels'' is being completely revamped. Gone is lead
actor Vivica A. Fox, as is Executive Producer Paris Barclay.
</P>
<P>
   _ More changes: Andrea Thompson (who played Detective Jill
Kirkendall) and executive producer David Milch departed ``NYPD
Blue'' (ABC); James McDaniel (Lt. Arthur Fancy) leaves at
mid-season ... Tony Danza joins the cast of ``Family Law'' (CBS)
... ``The Jamie Foxx Show'' (WB) is a guaranteed mid-season
cancellation _ the show is going off the air to make way for a new
comedy-variety series from Foxx. Jessica Biel, who posed almost
nude for Gear magazine last year, got her wish and is getting out
of the squeaky clean ``7th Heaven'' (WB) ... Buffy (Sarah Michelle
Gellar) gets a younger sister named Dawn (Michelle Trachtenberg) on
``Buffy the Vampire Slayer'' (WB).

   OLY-DRUGS-ANALYSIS (Sydney) _ As C.J. Hunter, the husband of

testing in the United States has come under fire from international
Olympic officials who consider the Americans hypocritical, laggard

EARLY EASTWOOD IS EASILY FORGIVEN (For use by New York Times News
Service clients) 
(Eds: Fact box below. `Tonight' refers to Wed., Sept. 27.) 
Our rating: 3 stars 
 
By DAVID KRONKE 
c. 2000 Los Angeles Daily News 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Critics sneered at Clint Eastwood's spaghetti westerns when they
first hit theaters, and now, the Man With No Name's essayist is the
subject of hagiography from PBS, which was born about the same time
as Eastwood's film career. ``Clint Eastwood: Out of the Shadows''
is an enjoyable documentary overview of the actor and Oscar-winning
filmmaker's career.
</P>
<P>
   Eastwood buffs may rightly grouse that it doesn't bring much new
or surprising to the party. Casual fans, however, may learn a thing
or two about a guy who was dismissed for too long as just another
action hero and who, in fact, preferred to insist in interviews
that he was more interested in telling stories than any subtext and
the depth he brought his films.
</P>
<P>
   ``You don't last that long without being very smart,'' observes
screenwriter William Goldman early on in the documentary. Sure
enough, we get a glimpse into Eastwood's plain-spoken,
unpretentious intelligence, ranging from his Depression-era youth
(which inspired his intrigue with drifters) to reactions to his own
success with films ranging from ``Bronco Billy'' to his Oscar
winner, the stark western ``Unforgiven.''
</P>
<P>
   Actors from Meryl Streep to Gene Hackman and directors like
Martin Scorsese and Curtis Hanson offer their perspectives on what
Eastwood has managed to achieve in his career. Richard Burton, in
archival footage, aptly describes Eastwood's on-screen presence as
``a dynamic lethargy''; Barry Reardon, formerly of Warner Bros.,
admits some in the studio initially considered his monkey movie
``Every Which Way but Loose'' ``unreleasable.''
</P>
<P>
   There are some curious oversights. One of Eastwood's most
interesting deconstructions of his anti-hero persona,
``Tightrope,'' is overlooked completely. The production, naturally,
glosses over Eastwood's hacky, fallow period of the late '80s and
early '90s, which produced such listless duds as ``The Dead Pool,''
``The Rookie'' and ``Pink Cadillac.'' (Curiously, directorial
triumphs such as ``Bird'' and ``White Hunter, Black Heart,'' the
first of his films to meditate on the themes explored more fully in
``Unforgiven,'' came in this same time span; ``Bird'' is expounded
upon at length, while ``Hunter'' is dismissed in a sentence or
two). Likewise, the star's personal life is discussed only enough
that its more tabloidlike omissions seem disingenuous.
</P>
<P>
   Nonetheless, it's a pretty intelligently compiled 90 minutes,
and casts Eastwood who made one of the few movies of the past
summer you didn't feel like an idiot for seeing, ``Space Cowboys''
in the unlikely but justly heralded role of bashful auteur. To
contradict his character in ``Unforgiven,'' ``deserve's'' got
EVERYTHING to do with it. &QL;

<TEXT>
<P>
   Given its outstanding pedigree, it isn't much of a surprise that
``Best in Show'' qualifies as a champion comedy.
Writer-director-actor Christopher Guest has reassembled the cast
members that made the small-town theater spoof ``Waiting for
Guffman'' and turned them loose on the world of dog shows. The
result is every bit as funny as you would hope.
</P>
<P>
   Guest has worked with the ``mockumentary'' format before, always
with spectacular results. His first effort came in Rob Reiner's
legendary and recently re-released ``This Is Spinal Tap,'' in which
he played perpetually bemused guitarist Nigel Tufnell. He then
wrote and directed and starred in ``Waiting for Guffman,'' playing
an outlandish small-town theater director with outsized designs on
Broadway.
</P>
<P>
   ``Best in Show'' isn't quite in the same class as the earlier
films. The storylines and characters aren't as rich, nor do they
come together at the end in a manner that is as satisfying. But
when a movie has as many on-target jokes as this one does, such
quibbles aren't all that important.
</P>
<P>
   The film's dog owners are typical Guest creations, totally
lacking a trace of self-awareness. Guest has always skirted the
line between satire and snobbery, and he does so again here. The
characters are so lovingly played by the cast, however, that it's
possible to laugh at their foibles and still leave the theater with
a good taste in your mouth.
</P>
<P>
   The movie follows several dog owners, all of whom have one
ultimate goal: to win the ``best in show'' award at the prestigious
Mayflower Dog Show, which the filmmakers have perfectly modeled
after the grandaddy of dog events, the Westminster Show.
</P>
<P>
   Among the canine crazies: A Yuppie couple (Parker Posey and
Michael Hitchcock) who transfer their own neuroses onto their
Weimaraner; a mild-mannered husband with (literally) two left feet
(Levy) who, along the way, discovers that his wife (Catherine
O'Hara) has a pretty colorful sexual past; a fly fisherman,
would-be ventriloquist (Guest); a gay couple in love with each
other and their Shih Tzus (Michael McKean and John Michael Higgins)
and a top-notch dog handler (Jane Lynch) who has strong feelings
for her canine charge and its voluptuous owner (Jennifer Coolidge).
</P>
<P>
   And once the show begins, we're treated to the observations of
commentators Buck Laughlin (Fred Willard) and Tevor Beckwith (Jim
Piddock). Willard is priceless playing an amiably inane broadcaster
(Joe Garagiola anyone?) who never lets discretion get in the way of
an observation. (Example: ``It's sad to look at how beautiful these
dogs are when you realize that in some countries they are eaten.'')
</P>
<P>
   That line sums up Guest's genius: comedy with plenty of bark and
bite. If we had tails, they'd be wagging. &QL;

&HT;     COMPANIES TAKE STEP TOWARD ALL-IN-ONE COMMUNICATOR 
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)

 &HT;     c.2000 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ Plans by Palm and Handspring to create hybrid
mobile phone and electronic organizer signal a renewed push in the
race to roll out all-in-one communication devices, analysts said.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's the gold at the end of the rainbow: to have one
device,'' said analyst James Johnson of A.G. Edwards, an investment
bank in New York. ``We're going to see a convergence of products
from here on out.''
</P>
<P>
   Past industry attempts, such as Qualcomm's PDQ and Nokia's
Communicator, have been too big and too pricey to attract users.
</P>
<P>
   But Santa Clara, Calif.-based Palm announced Monday that it
would team with Schaumburg, Ill.-based Motorola to develop a
``smart phone'' _ combining wireless Internet access, mobile phone,
and electronic organizer _ for delivery in 2002. Customers would
purchase the device through their wireless service provider.
</P>
<P>
   The partnership marks the first time Palm will jointly develop,
market and brand a combo device with a mobile phone manufacturer.
With this deal, the market's most popular hand-held organizer will
deploy its operating system and software on a wider range of
devices and sales channels.
</P>
<P>
   ``Instead of a couple dollars per unit from licensing fees per
device, this way, the revenues are more substantial,'' said analyst
James Faucette, of Pacific Crest Securities, an investment bank in
Portland, Ore., that specializes in communications technology. ``It
also extends their market penetration, taking it into wireless
(phone) stores.''
</P>
<P>
   Likewise, Motorola can tap into the hand-held organizer's
expertise. Motorola, the world's second largest mobile phone maker,
made a $65 million investment in Palm in December 1999.
</P>
<P>
   ``We want to seamlessly bring together features and technology,
so users will feel comfortable getting the best of both worlds,''
said Leif Soderbergh, Motorola's senior vice president of the
personal communication sector. ``We wouldn't get that through
straight licensing.''
</P>
<P>
   In the last year, Palm licensed its operating system with
Kyocera's Qualcomm mobile phone division and the Finnish Nokia, the
world's No. 1 mobile phone maker.
</P>
<P>
   Palm said that for the period ended Sept. 1, operating profit
rose to $23.9 million, or 4 cents a share, up from $10 million, or
2 cents per share, a year ago. Sales rose to $401 million from
$176.5 million. The company shipped about 1.5 million Palm devices
in the quarter, contributing to a total of more than 8.7 million
Palms sold.
</P>
<P>
   Separately, Mountain View, Calif.-based Handspring announced
Monday it would begin selling the $299 VisorPhone module by
mid-November. The module snaps into expansion slots on any Visor
hand-held _ which licenses the Palm operating system _ to allow
wireless Web access, text messaging and Caller ID, among other
features.
</P>
<P>
   Initially, Handspring will sell the module and phone service
plan through Handspring.com.

NEW VARIATIONS ON TRADITIONAL ROSH HASHANAH RECIPES
</HEADLINE>
bc-ROSH-FOOD1
cc,78p3  (For use by New York Times News Service clients) 
(Eds: With second recipes take) 
 
By NATALIE HAUGHTON 
c. 2000 Los Angeles Daily New 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Tradition is an important part of holiday celebrations, but
sometimes it's nice to break with tradition, updating the meal with
new and different creations.
</P>
<P>
   That's what Faye Levy suggests in her new cookbook ``1,000
Jewish Recipes'' (IDG Books Worldwide, Inc.; $35).
</P>
<P>
   ``I like to cook something interesting for the holiday and don't
do the same food every year,'' says the Woodland Hills author.
</P>
<P>
   For the coming celebration of Rosh Hashanah (which begins at
sundown Friday), Levy suggests serving a sea bass prepared with
either fillets or steaks, over rice pilaf studded with golden
raisins, dried cherries or cranberries, and toasted pistachios.
Although Levy's recipe, based on one she tasted at a Moroccan
Jewish home in Paris, calls for simmering the fish right in the
sauce, it's feasible to prepare the sauce separately in advance
(keep refrigerated or frozen) and serve it hot or cold over the
fish, which can be grilled.
</P>
<P>
   ``Fish is very traditional for Rosh Hashanah, as it represents
abundance and fertility,'' notes Levy.
</P>
<P>
   With it, try a colorful and flavorful vegetable salad. In
keeping with the holiday tradition of using sweet vegetables, it
contains plenty of fresh corn and red bell peppers.
</P>
<P>
   For Rosh Hashanah, Levy likes to make a cake topped with a
chocolate-based Honey Ganache. Pecans add the attractive finishing
touches.
</P>
<P>
   Or try candy balls that team sweet wine with two kinds of
chocolate, dried apricots and cookie crumbs that are rolled in
chopped almonds. The versatile recipe lends itself to variations in
dried fruits (try dried cherries or cranberries), liquid (use
orange or any fruit juice, or honey in place of wine), sweetener
(use jam or honey in place of sugar) and crumbs (use cake instead
of cookie). For variety, roll the balls in coconut or sifted cocoa
instead of nuts.
</P>
<P>
   The 625-page book is a treasure trove of kosher recipes running
the gamut from those for Jewish holidays to ideas to enliven
everyday and special occasion fare for family and friends. An
invaluable reference source for rituals and traditions, it also
includes chapters on Keeping Kosher and Stocking the Jewish Pantry.
</P>
<P>
   Levy hopes the book will help dispel the misconception that
Jewish food is time-consuming to prepare, boring, bland, unhealthy
and heavy.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's ridiculous -- it isn't anything like that. Jewish food
is varied, flavorful, fresh and exciting.''
</P>
<P>
   Just as Jewish cooking reflects the influences of many cultures
-- Middle Eastern, Mediterranean, Eastern and Central European and
more -- so do Levy's recipes.
</P>
<P>
   When she lived in Tel Aviv, each of the four floors of her
apartment building had different aromas wafting from the kitchens.
``There was a Moroccan family on one floor and Yemenites and
Tunisians each on two other floors -- and all cooked differently --
and it was all Jewish food with a wide array of seasonings and
flavors.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was fascinated by the food. I thought the food I grew up on
was Jewish food, but I found out that people in Israel cook their
own style of Jewish food -- like Moroccan Jewish, Indian Jewish,
Yemenite Jewish, Romanian Jewish, Hungarian Jewish, Iraqi Jewish,
etc.''
</P>
<P>
   All of these cultural tastes flavor her book. But the Old World
labor-intensive techniques have been left behind. Levy has
streamlined and modernized recipes and procedures to use the latest
kitchen equipment and gadgets that fit into the lifestyles of
today's cooks.
</P>
<P>
   For example, ``for gefilte fish, people used to buy a whole
fish, fillet and chop it by hand -- and it would take forever to
make. Now I buy fillets and use the food processor. However, I also
like to buy a whole fish, but I have the fish man bone it for me
and give me the bones so I can make stock.''
</P>
<P>
   Levy also relies on convenience foods when practical, such as
canned unsalted broths, canned tomatoes, canned beans, canned corn,
frozen vegetables and the like.
</P>
<P>
   The book is geared to both novice and accomplished cooks. To
make the recipes easy to use in kosher menus, each is coded with
``M'' for meat, ``D'' for dairy or ``P'' for pareve. Notes about
serving, ingredients and origins also accompany the recipes and
make for some interesting reading. &QL; 
--- &QL; 
CORN, SWEET PEPPER AND GREEN BEAN SALAD &QR; 
1 1/2 pounds green beans, ends removed and halved &QR; 
2 cups fresh (2 large ears) OR frozen corn kernels &QR;

</P>
<P>
   Add sea bass in one layer to sauce and sprinkle with salt and

&HT;     CEO OF SOUTHERN CAFETERIA CHAIN RESIGNS 
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 &HT;     By ELIZABETH ALLEN  
 &HT;     c.2000 San Antonio Express-News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN ANTONIO _ The president and chief executive officer of
Luby's Inc. resigned Monday, leaving the San Antonio-based
cafeteria chain searching for its fourth leader in five years.
</P>
<P>
   Barry J.C. Parker, who came to Luby's from the retail clothing
company County Seat in 1997, ``wished to resign to pursue other
interests,'' according to a statement. Parker's resignation is
``subject to finalizing a separation agreement,'' the company said.
</P>
<P>
   Board Chairman David B. Daviss has assumed the duties of chief
executive officer, the company said.
</P>
<P>
   Luby's operates 220 cafeteria-style restaurants mainly in the
South and Southwest.
</P>
<P>
   In 1999, Parker's salary was $375,000, and he received a bonus
of $93,500. He was employed under a three-year contract effective
Oct. 1, 1997.
</P>
<P>
   Some former managers, who had said in interviews that they were
unhappy with Parker's strategy and personal approach, greeted the
news of Parker's resignation with glee.
</P>
<P>
   When told of Parker's resignation, Tommy Griggs, a 40-year
veteran and former member of Luby's board of directors, said:
``That's tremendous. He's taken the stock from $21 down to five and
a quarter. It was something that was needed a long time ago.''
</P>
<P>
   Neil Schubert, who left the company earlier this year to open
his own cafeteria in San Antonio, said the move is a signal by
Luby's board of directors that they are paying more attention to
managers.
</P>
<P>
   ``The managers themselves I know will throw their arms up and
give a great big cheer,'' Schubert said.
</P>
<P>
   And stockholders, some of whom had seen the value of their
stocks decline 70 percent in three years, also expressed optimism.
</P>
<P>
   Les Greenberg, a shareholder who has led a campaign to shake up
the board of directors and who seeks a board seat, said he thought
the company would ``get back on track.''
</P>
<P>
   Luby's announced in August that it would close 15 stores and
would downgrade its fourth-quarter earnings expectations from more
than 20 cents a share to one to five cents a share.
</P>
<P>
   The company's same-store sales (or sales at stores opened at
least one year) were off 5.5 percent, in part because of new
bundled-meal offerings, which bring in less money than the same
dishes a la carte, Laura Bishop, chief financial officer, said at
the time.
</P>
<P>
   That bad news sent the stock price plunging more than 22
percent.
</P>
<P>
   Luby's, one of Texas' best-known restaurant brands, once earned
plaudits for its strategy from Forbes magazine. Yet Luby's
struggles began before Parker was hired.
</P>
<P>
   In March 1997, John E. Curtis Jr., the company's president and
chief executive officer of two months, committed suicide. The
company's chairman, Ralph ``Pete'' Erben resigned days later,
leaving John B. Lahourcade to hold down the positions of both men
until Parker was hired in September of that year.
</P>
<P>
   Changes instituted under Parker include outsourcing some of the
restaurants' food preparation, experiments with breakfast and later
hours, expansion of take-out services, construction of
drive-throughs and a reworking of management compensation that
resulted in a sharp income cut for some top managers.

 UNDATED: ... action: ``Dinosaurs.''  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   No doubt, the tension must give at some point. ``It's an issue
that has to be dealt with,'' says Walter McDonough, a Boston
entertainment lawyer and director of business and legal research
for an advocacy group called the Future of Music Coalition. ``We
are obligated to work this out without impeding the growth of the
Web,'' McDonough says.
</P>
<P>
   But how do you make that happen when the content owners and the
technology companies are duking it out in court? McDonough suggests
there is a ``common sense solution'' similar to the compulsory
license system used by radio stations. Under this proposal,
Internet music companies would need compulsory licenses to stream
music online and the funds generated would go into a pool to be
redistributed to the record labels and music publishers.
</P>
<P>
   Some academics have pointed toward a more radical solution,
suggesting a tax and royalty system in which money is collected
through a tax on either the electronics needed to play digital
content or on Internet services needed to access such
entertainment. The money would be distributed to creators in
proportion to how frequently their materials are used.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is conceivable that something as radical as that would be
necessary,'' says Fisher of Harvard. ``The effect of a dramatic
intervention of that sort would be to provide an alternative
revenue to creators.''
</P>
<P>
   Others have suggested that the music business will morph into a
service industry, with consumers paying for all-you-can-play
subscriptions in the same way they pay for cable television.
Meanwhile, the film industry has been talking about offering its
products online on a pay-per-view basis, but only when it finds a
way to protect the work from piracy. Technical experts contend,
however, that any protection system, no matter how sophisticated,
can eventually be cracked. ``It is important to recognize that
security isn't going to work,'' warns Sheirer of Forrester
Research.
</P>
<P>
   For now, however, the primary battlefield is in the courts. The
Napster appeal will be heard in court in the next few weeks, and
the Scour lawsuit has only just begun.
</P>
<P>
   But the battle lines are beginning to blur as entertainment
companies merge with technology companies. If the AOL-Time-Warner
merger is completed, the nation's largest content provider will be
under the same umbrella as the country's largest Internet service
provider. Likewise, Sony finds itself in a strange position in the
Napster case: Its record division is a plaintiff in the case, but
as a member of the Consumer Electronics Association, its
electronics business effectively signed onto an amicus brief filed
in defense of Napster.
</P>
<P>
   These are strange times, indeed.
</P>
<P>
   One thing is certain. The struggle for control over content gets
more intriguing every day. Back in March, Napster inventor Shawn
Fanning said he wrote the file-sharing software because he was
suffering from ennui during his short-lived tenure as a
Northeastern University student. ``I was bored,'' he said in a
Globe interview. ``I had some time.'' Today, the controversy is
anything but ho-hum.

<TEXT>
<P>
   Dick Francis is published in Britain in the spring, then in the
fall in the United States. For years, I would find someone going to
Britain in the spring and beg them to bring me back the new Dick
Francis mystery. I would read it, then send it to my dad as part of
his Father's Day gift.
</P>
<P>
   This went on for about 10 years until my dad told me he really
didn't like Dick Francis, especially because he didn't like reading
about racehorses.
</P>
<P>
   It is the whole racing scene that makes me grab Francis' latest
as soon as it comes out. The more horses, jockeys, racetracks and
steeplechases, the more I like the book. Unfortunately for me,
``Shattered'' (G.P. Puntam's Sons, $25.95, 289 pages) only has
racing in the first chapter. Nevertheless, Francis is in top form
as a storyteller in ``Shattered.''
</P>
<P>
   On Dec. 31, 1999, glassblower Gerard Logan rides to the
Cheltenham races with his best friend, jockey Martin Stukely. In
the Coffee Forever Trophy race, Stukely's mount, Tallahassee, ahead
by seven lengths, ``lost his concentration, hit the roots of an
unyielding birch and turned a somersault over his rider, landing
his whole half-ton mass upside down with the saddle tree and his
withers crushing the rib cage of the man beneath.''
</P>
<P>
   Stukely dies en route to the hospital. About to leave the
racetrack, Stukely's valet, Eddie, rushes after Logan and hands him
Stukely's racing saddle. Eddie also gives him a package containing
a videotape that Stukely planned on giving Logan after the race.
Logan jams the package into one of the inside pockets of his
raincoat, returns to his glassblowing shop and works late into the
evening.
</P>
<P>
   After closing up shop, he places the bag containing the day's
earnings and the videotape on a counter. Before he can lock up,
Tallahassee's owner, Lloyd Baxter, shows up with a bottle of
Champagne and they drink a toast to Stukely's memory. When the
Millennium fireworks begin, Logan goes outside to watch. When he
returns, he finds Baxter unconscious on the floor and the money bag
and videotape missing.
</P>
<P>
   The next morning, Logan goes to visit Stukely's family and finds
they have all been rendered unconscious. Stukely's mother-in-law is
on the stairs, her chauffeur, Worthington, ``sprawled like a
drugged medieval guard dog at her feet.'' He finds Stukely's widow,
Bon-Bon, on the floor of the den. Then Logan is hit with a heavy
object and he too is unconscious on the floor.
</P>
<P>
   When they all regain consciousness, they find that every
videotape, VCR and TV set has been taken. When Logan gets home, he
finds that someone has broken in and stolen all his videotapes. A
few days later, masked men grab Logan outside his shop, demanding
that he give them the videotape. When he says he doesn't have it,
they begin beating him up. They flee when one of Logan's neighbors
shows up.
</P>
<P>
   Logan has no idea what is on the videotape, but he knows he must
find it before someone gets seriously hurt or even killed.
</P>
<P>
   Francis has created a crazy cast of intriguing heroes and
lowlifes spouting witty dialogue within a very complex plot.
``Shattered'' is vintage Dick Francis, even if it is short on
horses.

   ``The PMS Outlaws.'' By Sharyn McCrumb. Ballantine Books. $24.
</P>
<P>
   Reading Sharyn McCrumb's latest cozy is a bit like having
English tea _ satisfying at the time, but not very lasting.
</P>
<P>
   Forensic anthropologist Elizabeth McPherson has just returned
from Scotland following the disappearance of her husband, believed
lost at sea. Depressed and unable to accept that he is dead, she
checks herself into the mental institution Cherry Tree, which her
family has considered its spa of preference for many decades. Her
depression doesn't improve, but she learns quickly that the
appearance of insanity allows you to be rude and say anything you
want.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, her brother Bill and his partner, A.P. Hill, decide
their law office in Danville, Va., is in too shabby a part of town
to attract top-notch clients. Hill is headed for Richmond on
business, so it is up to Bill to find their new offices. What he
finds is an old mansion, big enough so they each can have
apartments on the second floor. The only drawback is that the man
who built the house still lives in the sun room and is so old Bill
can't evict him.
</P>
<P>
   When Hill gets to Richmond, she learns her law school rival,
P.J. Purdue, has broken one of her clients out of prison and the
two have gone on the lam, seducing men, stealing their cars,
clothes and wallets and moving on. The tabloids nickname them the
PMS Bandits.
</P>
<P>
   Somehow, McCrumb makes it all come together as she moves between
the three disparate storylines, aided by some wickedly funny
dialogue. One of Elizabeth's fellow inmates who equates success
with beauty says: ``Anorexia is not a disease; it's a career
move.'' A nice little read for a football Saturday afternoon.

</P>
<P>
   ``Texas Crime Chronicles _ Outrageous True Stories of Murder and
Mayhem in the Lone Star State.'' From the Editors of the Texas
Monthly. Warner Books. 514 pages. $6.99 paperback.
</P>
<P>
   If you like true crime, some outrageous Texans and terrific
writing, this one's for you. All the articles have run in the Texas
Monthly.
</P>
<P>
   The first in this collection ran in 1975 and tells the
background of pit bull fighting in Texas. Another, titled ``I Loved
the Dapper Bandit,'' is told from a prostitute's view of her affair
with a man she did not know was a bank robber until he got caught
and tried to shoot himself in the head. Being a poor shot, he ended
up in a wheelchair and in prison.
</P>
<P>
   The 1998 story, ``Midnight in the Garden of East Texas,'' is a
tale of Bernie Tielde, a likable assistant funeral director who
befriends widows and becomes the sole companion of the town's
richest but nastiest widow.
</P>
<P>
   When she disappears for nine months, no one worries. When her
body is found in the bottom of her deep freezer with a bullet in
her back, no one is sorry. When Bernie confesses, almost everyone
in town thinks he should get off. Really a bizarre story.
</P>
<P>
   Other tales include the University of Texas sniper Charles
Whitman and the cheerleader mom who tried to kill her daughter's
rival.
</P>
<P>
   Incredible tales told by some marvelous writers. Check it out.

WHAT'S THE NEXT NEW THING ON YOUR INTERNET DASHBOARD? 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By PAUL TORCHIA AND MATT CARROLL  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   In the past five years, the creative breeding ground of the
Internet has changed our lives with a dizzyingly long list of
innovations: browsing, e-mail, online auctions, day trading,
instant messaging, Napster. While not all consumers have used
everything, most have become dependent on at least one.
</P>
<P>
   It has not been an altogether smooth ride. People have thrown up
their hands in frustration after wandering in the Internet
wilderness searching for, say, the cheapest airline ticket. Or they
have cringed at the idea of handing over personal information to
anonymous online vendors.
</P>
<P>
   Such are the problems that have spawned the next big thing on
the Net, one that is expected to give more power to consumers.
</P>
<P>
   Coming soon: software applications that will search the Net for
you, comparison shopping for a used car, and taking into account
your desire for something with CD player and six cylinders.
</P>
<P>
   Another application will search out blue-chip stocks with solid
earnings that will appeal to your conservative financial views. And
a third will alert the local oil dealer with the best price around
that you are low on heating oil.
</P>
<P>
   These separate applications _ and others that collect specific
information on everything from stamp collecting to medical records
_ will be viewed through one overarching, personal ``dashboard''
that will display all the information that has been collected.
</P>
<P>
   The dashboard program will also jealously protect a consumer's
personal and financial privacy by releasing just the data needed to
make a purchase, and nothing more.
</P>
<P>
   These changes will flip the traditional business model on its
head. Until now, companies have told consumers what was available
and at what price. Now a customer's software will tell a company
what the consumer wants and what price the person is willing to
pay. Interested companies will need to scramble to fulfill that
need.
</P>
<P>
   Leverage will shift to a new type of proactive consumer _ a
``prosumer,'' perhaps? This consumer _ no longer locked into any
one particular company _ will be empowered to pick and choose based
on criteria they establish, and it will be up to companies to meet
it.
</P>
<P>
   Bits and pieces of this are available now and more are coming.
ByAllAccounts.com of Woburn, Mass., which was launched in July,
offers consumers a single place to monitor and analyze financial
data. The idea is to help individuals, who might have portfolios
with a half-dozen or more financial companies, pull that
information together, said L. Patrick Gardner, co-founder and CEO.
</P>
<P>
   Users set up online accounts with the company, which collects
the information from the companies where the user keeps accounts.
The software offers tools to measure investment performance and can
send alerts when there are important changes.
</P>
<P>
   Companies like this allow consumers to gain more control. With
information centralized, consumers can more easily measure their
own financial health, as well as more easily measure the
performance of the financial institutions that are caring for
users' investments. Gardner sees this as just a start, and ``the
next step is to offer guidance or advice.''
</P>
<P>
   Another startup, VigilTech.com in Acton, Mass., has built
software that searches the Internet to provide desktop information
on specific topics to business users, said Gidi Cohen, founder and
chief executive officer. Users can create their own custom
categories.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our technology takes input from the user and then adapts as it
scours the Internet, to provide information to the desktop on what
you need and want, when you need and want it,'' Cohen said.
</P>
<P>
   Other companies have developed software that makes it easy for
buyers to comparison shop. Frictionless Commerce of Cambridge,
Mass. sells its software to sites such as Lycos.com, which uses it
in its comparison shopping section, said Robert H. Guttman,
co-founder and chief technology officer.
</P>
<P>
   The software can be used to find the best prices on everything
from car seats to laptops; from printers to in-line skates. ``We
have pieces of software that crawl the Web and find pieces of
information,'' Guttman said.
</P>
<P>
   But this is just the beginning. These companies, or new
companies, will push this concept into new directions. The end
result will be greater ease for users in finding what they need.
</P>
<P>
   Changes are also being driven by concerns about protecting
personal privacy. People have read about online thefts of credit
card numbers and the recent bankruptcy fight over Toysmart.com, in
which supposedly protected personal data about customers may be
tossed on the auction block.
</P>
<P>
   Pattie Maes, an associate professor at MIT's Media Lab, is
acutely aware of the concerns people have over protecting their
personal data. Maes founded Firefly Network Inc., which was one of
the first companies to commercialize technology for building
profiles of its users.
</P>
<P>
   ``Ultimately, it has to be the user that has control,'' she
said. While obstacles remain from legal to cultural, the time is
right for consumers to grab much greater control of their own data,
she said. ``It is a real need right now.''
</P>
<P>
   She pointed out that personal profile data is sold to other
companies without your knowing it. There is no reason, she says,
that users should not be able to use their own data to negotiate
better deals.
</P>
<P>
   In some ways, some of the new software fulfills old business
ideas called ``sense and respond.'' It's not an original online
idea. It is, for example, what oil companies have done for years by
counting degree days and thus knowing when to fill a customers'
tank before it is empty.
</P>
<P>
   But online companies can carry the idea a step further. What if
consumers didn't lock into one particular oil company? What if they
bought from whichever dealer happened to have the lowest price? And
what if this all happened automatically?
</P>
<P>
   That's the promise of the new era in software. Soon it will
suggest we transfer money to a new bank with higher interest rates
on CDs, look through our doctor's computer to get the results of
the latest lab test, get test scores from school, and maybe catch a
note from the baseball coach about how Junior needs to work on
ground balls.
</P>
<P>
   We're not quite there yet. But it's where smart consumer
companies are headed. They know that we, the consumers, want _ make
that, deserve _ the ultimate in customer experience. Smart
companies will work hard to find out exactly what consumers want,
educate them about their product or service, and then provide it
when asked. It's the next big thing.

2 PARTIES CRY FOUL OVER TAPE; THEY PIN MYSTERY LEAK ON A MOLE,
MISCHIEF
</HEADLINE>
  (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
 By JAY ROOT 
 c.2000 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ While aides to Gov. George W. Bush say there may
be a mole in their midst, Texas Democrats are blaming the
Republican campaign's top dog for leaking sensitive information to
the enemy camp.
</P>
<P>
   At issue is how a debate preparation tape and confidential
campaign documents made it into the hands of an aide to Vice
President Al Gore, a mystery now being investigated by the FBI. The
Bush campaign suggested over the weekend that the Gore campaign had
planted a spy at the campaign's headquarters in Austin.
</P>
<P>
   On Monday, Molly Beth Malcolm, Texas Democratic Party chairman,
offered up a different scenario: Karl Rove, Bush's chief political
consultant, manufactured the incident to create a distraction from
a campaign struggling to regain its footing.
</P>
<P>
   ``This has Karl Rove's fingerprints written all over it,'' said
Malcolm, who offered no proof to back up her contention. She said
it was no coincidence that Rove was at the center of an
eavesdropping controversy in the 1986 Texas governor's race, a
mystery that also drew the attention of the FBI but was never
officially solved.
</P>
<P>
   ``His history is this kind of stuff,'' Malcolm said. ``This
helps get the attention off of the issues of this campaign and
maybe helps Karl.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush campaign spokesman Dan Bartlett called the accusation
``silly partisan rhetoric'' aimed at distracting attention from a
Gore aide's suspension after he reportedly bragged that he knew of
a mole in the Bush camp. The aide, Michael Doyne, now says he made
it up.
</P>
<P>
   ``It seems the more the FBI investigates, the more nervous
Nashville gets,'' Bartlett said. ``It appears also that Al Gore
will say anything to get elected and the Gore campaign will do
anything to get elected.''
</P>
<P>
   Bartlett also accused the Justice Department of politicizing the
investigation. He was referring to published reports that the FBI
had identified a suspect within the Bush campaign.
</P>
<P>
   The current Justice Department, he said, ``has a history of
playing politics with investigations.''
</P>
<P>
   The mystery began on Sept. 13, when Gore confidant Tom Downey, a
former New York congressman, received an Express Mail package
containing a videotape of Bush in a mock debate. Also in the
package was a stack of debate briefing papers.
</P>
<P>
   Downey promptly turned the package over to the FBI, and the tape
caper has been grabbing headlines ever since.
</P>
<P>
   Whoever is responsible for the leak, Democrats say it bears an
uncanny resemblance to a bugging case that mysteriously emerged in
the waning days of the 1986 Texas governor's race, a bitter rematch
between Democratic Gov. Mark White and former Gov. Bill Clements,
whom White had ousted four years earlier.
</P>
<P>
   Then, as now, there was an alleged security breach at the height
of a very close contest. Then, as now, the chief campaign
consultant to the Republican candidate was Karl Rove. And then, as
now, the FBI got involved.
</P>
<P>
   Something else is strikingly similar, and equally intriguing to
conspiracy theorists: One of the other main characters in the 1986
drama was Mark McKinnon, then an aide to White, now Bush's top
media consultant.
</P>
<P>
   In the current mystery, McKinnon and Rove are two of a handful
of senior aides who had copies of the videotape. In 1986, Rove and
McKinnon were on opposite sides of the bugging flap, which occurred
on the eve of a televised debate between White and Clements.
</P>
<P>
   Rove, employing language similar to the phrase Bush officials
now use to tar Gore, blamed the bugging on the White campaign:
``Finding the bug convinced me that the opposition would say
anything and do anything to win an election,'' Rove told The
Washington Post for an article that ran Oct. 7, 1986.
</P>
<P>
   McKinnon, then press secretary to White, bristled at the
suggestion that the campaign of the Democratic governor _ defeated
a few weeks later by his old rival _ was involved.
</P>
<P>
   ``It seems to me that the Republicans are the ones who have
experience at this kind of stuff,'' he told the Fort Worth
Star-Telegram, referring to the Watergate scandal.
</P>
<P>
   Fourteen years later, McKinnon and Rove are again making
headlines together, albeit under markedly different circumstances.
</P>
<P>
   In the debate tape mystery, Republicans in Washington have
expressed suspicions that McKinnon, who used to work exclusively
for Democrats, might have a Democratic spy on his staff, according
to published reports.
</P>
<P>
   McKinnon did not return telephone calls placed Monday by the
Star-Telegram, but he said in a Sept. 21 Washington Post article,
``There is no possibility of a mole on my staff.''
</P>
<P>
   While McKinnon and other top officials have been interviewed by
the FBI, Rove had not, as of late Monday, aides said. That alone,
as Time magazine reported, ``started a new torrent of
speculation.''
</P>
<P>
   Bartlett, the Bush spokesman, said Rove would be available for
FBI agents ``as soon as they are ready.''

FEAR AND ANGST ON THE TECH FRONT 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By STEVEN SYRE AND CHARLES STEIN  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   David Santos was having a rough morning.
</P>
<P>
   Intel had just reported an earnings shortfall, and the Nasdaq
Composite index was crumbling. Santos's fund, the brand-new Putnam
Technology Fund, was taking its lumps, along with the rest of the
market.
</P>
<P>
   But Santos's basic optimism about technology wasn't dented at
all. ``When you invest in technology you are going to have periods
of fear and angst,'' he explained.
</P>
<P>
   Santos's $180 million fund was launched in July, but he has been
investing in tech stocks for Putnam Investments since 1992. We
spoke with him to get his take on the current market.
</P>
<P>
   Q: What's been hurting tech stocks this year?
</P>
<P>
   Santos: A few different things. We came into this year with some
very aggressive expectations for sales of wireless handsets. After
the second quarter, it became clear that demand was not going to be
as strong as anticipated. Sales are still going to be very healthy,
just not as strong as expected.
</P>
<P>
   Q: So you are still upbeat about wireless technology?
</P>
<P>
   Santos: We are still comfortable with the wireless story. The
market is just emerging for wireless data and wireless Internet
access. That should drive substantial demand for years to come.
</P>
<P>
   Q: How worried should we be about the bad news from Intel?
</P>
<P>
   Santos: The problem seems to be centered in Europe. The euro
could be affecting the market. In general, the corporate market for
personal computers in Europe has not reaccelerated in 2000. We
don't think there is a problem with global demand for personal
computers.
</P>
<P>
   Another source of investor angst is the telecom sector. A lot of
carriers seem to be in real trouble.
</P>
<P>
   You have to make a clear distinction between the very large,
well-established telecom companies _ SBC, Verizon, WorldCom _ and
the emerging carriers. Right now, we are seeing a shakeout among
the emerging carriers. Every week, a company you never heard of
says it is running out of cash and it is going bankrupt. But I am
firmly convinced that the large players will continue to spend
money on equipment at a healthy rate. They cannot afford not to.
The competitive environment is only getting more intense.
</P>
<P>
   Q: How about one more problem _ the slowing economy. Does it
matter to tech companies?
</P>
<P>
   Santos: Our position is that if the Fed slows the economy down
from a 5 percent growth rate to a 3 percent growth rate, tech
spending will be fine. If the economy slows a lot more than that,
we would be concerned.
</P>
<P>
   Q: OK. We've hit a lot of negatives. What areas in technology do
you like?
</P>
<P>
   Santos: One area is networking. We like the blue-chip leader,
Cisco Systems, plus a number of other names: Juniper Networks,
Redback Networks, Nortel Networks, and Sycamore Networks.
</P>
<P>
   Q: You didn't mention Lucent Technologies in that list.
</P>
<P>
   Santos: Lucent missed a significant product cycle. It is still a
high-quality company but it has a disadvantage to overcome. Time
will tell if it can do that.
</P>
<P>
   Q: What else do you like?
</P>
<P>
   Santos: One of our major themes is software. Because of the
Internet, companies are Webifying their organizations, reaching out
to customers, lowering their costs, and enhancing service. It is a
clear and powerful trend in technology, and we are in the early
stages of it. Some of the names we like there are I2 Technologies,
Verisign, BEA Systems, and Art Technology Group.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Everyone seems to love the storage companies. Are you high on
that sector, as well?
</P>
<P>
   Santos: Yes. There is a tremendous need for data storage. There
are four key players in storage: EMC, Veritas, Network Appliance,
and Brocade Communications.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Some of the tech stocks you like trade at awfully high
valuations. Do you just ignore that?
</P>
<P>
   Santos: We don't ignore valuations, but we want to be focused on
companies that can continue to deliver earnings results above
expectations.
</P>
<P>
   Q: So your basic position on tech stocks is ``stay the course?''
</P>
<P>
   Santos: I have been investing in technology long enough to know
that longer term, the trends are overwhelmingly positive. That
doesn't mean we won't go through events like the Asian crisis and
Y2K that cause fear and angst. When you invest in a sector with
high valuations there will be periods when the market is robust and
periods when the market is skittish.

<TEXT>
<P>
   SYDNEY, Australia _ Tuesday, the Sydney Olympic boxing
tournament got serious. Tuesday the quality fighters braced their
feet and threw punches with unfeigned malice. The medal rounds
await, and everything about the tournament has become a little
bigger, louder, faster.
</P>
<P>
   Little of this was good news for the U.S. boxers in the field.
Or those bounced from it _ a number that swelled to seven Tuesday.
Only one member of the U.S. team on Tuesday matched the increased
intensity that accompanied the quarterfinals.
</P>
<P>
   If not for Clarence Vinson, who fought spectacularly in
defeating the reigning bantamweight world champion, Olteanu
George-Crinu of Romania, by 26-19 on points, the United States
would have been shut out.
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. fighter, Michael Bennett, lost his bid to unseat the
famed Cuban heavyweight Felix Savon, who stopped Bennett on points
23-8 at the end of the third round. The U.S. middleweight Jeff Lacy
didn't get out of the third round either, losing on points to the
Russian Gaidarbek Gaidarbekov, 18-3. In the Olympics, bouts are
stopped if one fighter trails by 15 points.
</P>
<P>
   While two of three Americans were wilting Tuesday, the Cuban
boxing team continued its unrelenting march through the brackets.
Only 2 of 12 boxers from Cuba have lost, and Tuesday, five Cubans
advanced to the semifinals, including middleweight Jorge Gutierrez,
who won with a one-punch, first-round knockout.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   The feature of the day was Savon against Bennett, a fight that
brought something of a title fight atmosphere to the arena. What
developed was an action-packed fight, one that seemed closer than
the judges' totals, although Savon clearly had a command of the
ring and a huge reach advantage on Bennett.
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. boxing coach Tom Mustin, however, believed that Savon,
a six-time world champion, received points for his reputation.
</P>
<P>
   ``The judges gave Savon too many points for right hands that
landed on Bennett's arms and shoulders,'' Mustin said. ``I thought
the fight was getting closer and if it kept going, there would have
been a great fourth round.
</P>
<P>
   ``Maybe when Savon throws that right, they just expect it to
land, so they score it. But Michael wasn't getting hit in the head.
At the end of the fight, one of the officials said Savon was the
one who looked hurt.''
</P>
<P>
   Savon had forfeit his chance to face Bennett in last year's
world championship final, allowing Bennett a victory as a way of
protesting a controversial decision against a teammate earlier in
the competition, there had been at least some wonder if Bennett
couldn't challenge Cuba's nearly silent, mythic champ, who is now
33 years old.
</P>
<P>
   That Bennett, 29, has been fighting competitively for only two
years after having served seven years in jail for armed robbery
added intrigue to the bout. Certainly, Bennett did not figure to be
awed by Savon, a two-time defending Olympic heavyweight champion,
and indeed, he wasn't. Bennett fought aggressively from the
beginning, landing the fight's first punch, and continued to throw
lefts and rights even as he was being backed up.
</P>
<P>
   But at 6-feet-6{ inches, Savon was more than half a foot taller
than Bennett and he kept the American at arm's length for most of
the fight. And his right hand, one of the most famed weapons in
Olympic boxing history, scores points _ justly or not _ with
startling frequency.
</P>
<P>
   Bennett did briefly stun Savon with a crisp right hand early in
the third round, but Savon kept piling up points, and just as the
round ended, the score was 23-8.
</P>
<P>
   ``Savon was the better warrior today,'' Bennett said afterward.
``I did my best.''
</P>
<P>
   Getting inside Savon's reach was harder than he expected,
Bennett conceded. Bennett had also planned to avoid getting into a
slugfest, but he acknowledged that it's easier to talk about doing
it, harder to do it when your 6-6 opponent is hitting you every few
seconds.
</P>
<P>
   Savon, as has been his custom throughout the Sydney Games, did
not speak with reporters afterward. He was unusually animated in
the ring, briefly taunting Bennett, and he left his corner after
the fight smiling and waving his arms at the crowd.
</P>
<P>
   Savon is now the runaway favorite to join the other great
heavyweight never to turn professional _ Cuba's Teofilo Stevenson _
as a three-time gold medal winner in the same boxing weight class
(91 kilograms).
</P>
<P>
   Fighting in 75-kilogram class, Lacy had knocked out one opponent
and stopped another in the second round, but Tuesday against
Gaidarbekov, a 24-year-old Russian with little international or
major competition experience, Lacy looked timid and overmatched.
</P>
<P>
   In a spirited 54-kilogram quarterfinal, Vinson traded
combinations with George-Crinu across four lively rounds. Vinson
was cut across the bridge of his nose in the third round but
responded with punches in flurries that left George-Crinu's face
red and swollen, and in the end, a loser. George-Crinu, four years
older than the 22-year-old Vinson, appeared stronger and was
unyielding in his advances.
</P>
<P>
   But Vinson, who fought after Bennett and Lacy had lost, stood
his ground and threw dozens of punches.
</P>
<P>
   ``It really hurt to see those guys lose,'' Vinson said. ``But
Michael Bennett came to me and said: `I fell off the ship, you've
got to handle it now.' And he was right. I needed a win and the
team needed a win.''

MICROSOFT STEPS OVER THE LINE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DAVID WARSH  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   The first sounds over the radio are those of an excited
classroom. Then a rich (if slightly dissipated) baritone is heard:
</P>
<P>
   ``OK, OK, I need an easy question now. Hey, who's that little
fellow in the fourth row?''
</P>
<P>
   A proud young student pipes up: ``I'm Billy. Senator, where do
you stand on the privatization of at least a portion of a worker's
Social Security tax?''
</P>
<P>
   Senator: ``Oh, boy, that's right important to me, 'cause as you
can see I'm getting on in years. But aren't you a little young to
be worrying about something like that?''
</P>
<P>
   Billy: ``Not really, since studies show that the Social Security
system will be running a deficit by 2012 and will go bankrupt by
2034.''
</P>
<P>
   An announcer booms: ``With Microsoft Encarta Reference Suite
2001, learning has never been easier or more enjoyable. Combining
the rich content of a CD-ROM with the latest information from
carefully reviewed Web sites, Encarta immerses children in the most
engaging learning experience ever.''
</P>
<P>
   Senator: ``Well, it sounds like you really know your stuff,
little man!''
</P>
<P>
   Billy: ``Yeah, and so do people ages 18 to 34. Studies show that
they believe more in UFOs than in any chance they'll collect Social
Security benefits. . . .''
</P>
<P>
   Senator, interrupting: ``Uh, don't you have soccer practice or
something to go to?
</P>
<P>
   Announcer: ``Pick up your copy of Microsoft Encarta Suite . .
.''
</P>
<P>
   That's the text of a commercial for a the digital encylopedia
that Microsoft Corp. bought some years ago and built on after
Encyclopaedia Britannica declined to become a partner.
</P>
<P>
   The commercial has been running recently in the Boston area
during sports talk shows and it is as revealing a detail as any on
which to dwell on the occasion of the 25th anniversary of
Microsoft's founding.
</P>
<P>
   Is the advertisement mistaken? Absolutely.
</P>
<P>
   For one thing, the dates are wrong. They are taken from an
outdated Trustees' Report; the current official guesstimates are
2015 and 2037. It's no big deal unless it's an encyclopedia you're
selling.
</P>
<P>
   More important, the concept of ``bankruptcy'' is deeply
misleading.
</P>
<P>
   Even if no adjustments are made to the current schedule of
benefits and taxes _ if the Social Security surplus is indeed
exhausted by 2037 _ then current taxes still will cover 70 percent
of benefits in 2038. That's a shortfall, for sure. But it's hardly
a government bankruptcy.
</P>
<P>
   Is the advertisement outrageous? Certainly it seems so to me.
</P>
<P>
   The future of the Social Security system is one of the two or
three central issues of the 2000 presidential campaign _ and
probably will remain at the center of politics for another dozen
years.
</P>
<P>
   Corporations fund advocacy groups to lobby against government
programs all the time. But it's rare, if not unheard of, for a big
company to take its political views directly to the public cloaked
in the authority of one of its products.
</P>
<P>
   Alas, the audacity is typical. The government's recent
successful antitrust trial exposed a history of corporate misdeeds
that you wouldn't believe if you saw it on a television
cops-and-robbers show. Microsoft is trying to overturn the verdict,
by fair means and foul.
</P>
<P>
   Now those rich kids in Seattle are using their ``encyclopedia''
to attack Social Security. Goodness knows what other partisan
malarkey may be in that compendium of ``fact.''
</P>
<P>
   To judge from the ad, Microsoft wants to disassemble not just a
mainstay of the American social compact, but the wall of custom
that keeps business out of popular politics. It's time to send them
back to a little honest industrial competition.

   Perhaps something good has come out of the recent fuel crisis
after all. The protests over high oil prices during the past two
weeks are now forcing many European governments to rethink their
taxes on fuel. In America too, the threat of a winter heating-oil
crisis has led to a noisy debate over energy policy. In principle,
this is good news. These countries' confused energy-taxation
regimes need some serious scrutiny. But that, of course, is not
what is happening. &QL;

   Nowhere in Latin America has democracy been more openly flouted
this year than in Peru. By standing for a third, constitutionally
dubious term after a decade in power, and then staging a deeply
flawed election, Alberto Fujimori succeeded only in dividing his
country and antagonizing the outside world, notably the United
States. So Fujimori's sudden call for fresh elections, this time
ruling himself out as a candidate, is welcome. It offers Peru the
chance to make the fresh democratic start it needs. Alas, there are
plenty of dangers and uncertainties ahead. &QL;

   HORSE CAVE AND PARK CITY, KY. _ More than 100 years ago, the
small town of Horse Cave became the second city in Kentucky to be
wired for electricity. It did this by harnessing the swooshing
waters of the Hidden River, an underground stream that briefly
opens to the sky in the center of town. After this great feat,
Hidden River cave remained unused for most of the 20th century _
except as a particularly nauseating open sewer. Now, once again, it
is the center of town. Caves are once again becoming big business
in central Kentucky. &QL;

   TEHRAN _ In recent weeks, high-ranking Iranian and American
dignitaries have begun to meet in intriguing ways. A number of
Iranian MPs, including Mehdi Karroubi, the speaker of the
parliament, ran into several American congressmen earlier this
month in New York at a reception at the Metropolitan Museum of Art.
Mere coincidence, said Karroubi. Few believed him. All this
posturing and gesturing reveals that both sides in Iran, reformist
and conservative, would like to see an end to the 21-year rift in
relations. For the first time, the conservative establishment has
admitted what it once acknowledged only in private: that Iran can
no longer afford to snub the Great Satan. &QL;

regulations on SUVs. &QL;

CELL PHONE CHIP TRANSFORMING DAILY LIVES AROUND GLOBE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By HIAWATHA BRAY  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Ask the average person to name a computer chip, and he would
probably choose Intel Corp.'s Pentium III or the Athlon from
Advanced Micro Devices Inc. He probably wouldn't single out the
processor chip inside the typical cell phone.
</P>
<P>
   But that cell phone chip, and millions like it, are transforming
the daily lives of people throughout the world in ways no Pentium
or Athlon can match.
</P>
<P>
   The chip technology that drives a cellphone also drives the
newest digital cameras. Similar chips power the MP3 music players
that are rewriting the recording industry's business models. You'll
find them managing billions of bits of data flowing over the
nation's phone lines every second. They're even used to sort
chocolates in candy factories. Indeed, these remarkable chips are
starting to appear in almost every device that links human beings
to the digital universe.
</P>
<P>
   The chips are called digital signal processors, or DSPs, and
they may be the most important pieces of silicon in the world right
now. DSPs are specialized computers that can digitally reshape the
events of the real world, such as sounds and images. And since
nearly everybody in the real world uses electronic gadgets, it's no
surprise that engineers are cramming them full of these superchips.
</P>
<P>
   Chipmakers sold $4.4 billion worth of DSPs last year, according
to Tempe, Ariz.-based Forward Concepts, a semiconductor research
consulting firm based in Tempe, Ariz. Sales are expected to top $6
billion this year and grow to $19 billion in 2004. ``It is the
technology driver of the semiconductor industry,'' said Forward
Concepts analyst Will Strauss.
</P>
<P>
   The DSP boom has echoed through the corridors of Analog Devices
Inc. in Norwood. Already the fourth largest maker of DSP chips, the
company saw its DSP sales leap 143 percent for the quarter ended
July 29. Analog posted quarterly revenues of $700.7 million, up 85
percent. Profits for the quarter, at $192 million, were more than
three times higher than the same period last year.
</P>
<P>
   And Analog is one of the smaller players in the industry. By
far, the leading maker of DSP chips is Texas Instruments Inc., with
about half the market in 1999. Next comes Lucent Technologies Inc.,
with about a quarter of the business. Analog is neck and neck with
Motorola Inc., at about 10 percent market share each. Analog
designs its chips in Massachusetts but farms out manufacturing to
chip foundries in Asia.
</P>
<P>
   The familiar Pentium and many other chips are ``general-purpose
microprocessors.'' These are the Clydesdales of computing,
workhorse chips used for a vast variety of tasks, many of them
having little to do with mathematical calculation. For instance,
the processor in a desktop PC spends much of its time just moving
data between itself, the main memory bank, and the hard drive. A
lot of the chip's transistors are devoted to this kind of
housekeeping duty.
</P>
<P>
   By comparison, a DSP is like a thoroughbred groomed for the
Kentucky Derby. This sliver of silicon is optimized to perform
extremely complex math equations. Equally important, it's designed
to do this math in real time, engineer-speak for instantly, as
events happen. That makes DSPs ideal for manipulating information
when processing delays are unacceptable.
</P>
<P>
   Sounds and images start out as analog data. They come in waves,
not in digital packets. This data is first converted to digital
form by a chip that samples the analog waves millions of times each
second. The result is a digital simulation of the wave that can
then be processed by a digital computer.
</P>
<P>
   Here's where the speed of a DSP becomes critical. Analog events
_ for example, somebody talking into a cellphone _ happen in real
time. Each tiny digital data sample has to be processed in
millionths of a second to avoid any gaps or delays in the
conversation.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the world of signal processing, you have to be able to
process real time,'' said Robert Conrad, vice president of Analog
Devices' DSP division. ``When you take a sample, you have to
process it completely before the next sample comes in.''
</P>
<P>
   Thanks to its speed, the DSP can perform some magical
transformations. Say you're using the cell phone in a noisy room.
Little of that noise will reach the person on the other end. That's
because the DSP uses complex math algorithms that can tell the
difference between background noise and the user's voice. The chip
instantly deletes most of the noise, so that the voice comes
through clearly.
</P>
<P>
   DSPs are so good at cleaning up line noise that callers might
hear dead silence at each pause in the conversation. That could
make them hang up, thinking the connection has been broken. So some
DSP chips used in phones are programmed to insert a little extra
background hiss, just in case.
</P>
<P>
   The DSP can do all this while using just a fraction of the
electrical power that a Pentium needs. And then there's the price.
High-end Pentium IIIs sell for hundreds of dollars apiece. The DSP
chip in your phone runs about five bucks.
</P>
<P>
   Chances are that your phone's chip was made by Texas
Instruments, which makes 70 percent of all DSPs found in wireless
phones. The company is also determined to win in other DSP markets.
It spends millions at universities around the world to train future
engineers and programmers in the use of DSP chips. And Texas
Instruments has assembled teams of engineers, each targeting an
up-and-coming DSP market, such as digital music players, digital
cameras, and Internet telephone products.
</P>
<P>
   ``Each one of those teams are on a mission from God to become
the next wireless,'' said Greg Delagi, Texas Instruments' DSP vice
president.
</P>
<P>
   Analog Devices isn't sitting still either. The company worked
closely with Aware Inc. of Bedford to develop the DSL systems used
in thousands of homes to provide high-speed Internet access over
standard phone lines. DSP chips are at the heart of DSL systems,
and Analog is the market leader in this segment. The company is
also a major producer of DSP chips for cable modems, another
popular broadband technology.
</P>
<P>
   DSPs are starting to appear in home appliances, to precisely
regulate the energy consumption of a refrigerator or washing
machine. Analog Devices DSPs are appearing in air conditioners,
constantly measuring room temperature and making tiny adjustments
in fan and compressor speeds. The result is optimum cooling
performance, using a minimum of electricity.
</P>
<P>
   General Motors Inc. uses DSPs in its optional OnStar automobile
tracking system; the chips use signals from the global network of
GPS navigation satellites to provide a precise location for the
car.
</P>
<P>
   Gerald McGuire, product line director for Analog Devices, says
DSPs will become even more popular with automakers in the years
ahead. He sees them replacing less-advanced microprocessors in
controlling automobile fuel systems.
</P>
<P>
   ``If the government ever says to the automakers, you've got to
get your fuel average up to 40 miles a gallon, they'll be coming to
us for DSPs,'' McGuire said.
</P>
<P>
   The technology is even used to make blind machines see. Cognex
Corp. of Natick, Mass. puts DSPs in its In-Sight machine vision
products, used by manufacturers to automate industrial processes.
The DSP uses its processing power to analyze a video input,
recognize patterns, and control a robot. One such machine was
designed by Cognex for a candy maker, to enable its robotic
packaging machine to pick individual chocolates from a production
line.
</P>
<P>
   As computing and data networking capacity is blended into more
and more of the world's machines, the number of potential uses for
DSP just keeps growing, along with the financial prospects of
Analog Devices, Texas Instruments, and the other DSP makers. Said
Will Strauss of Forward Concepts: ``DSP is everywhere.''

SLAVE LABOR COMPENSATION: A RUSSIAN-GERMAN FRONTIER 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By BRIAN WHITMORE  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WARSAW _ Mariana Ignaczak and Jan Belina have much in common.
Both are Polish, both are senior citizens, and both were forced to
work as slave laborers in World War II.
</P>
<P>
   But as various courts and bureaucrats decide the degree to which
each has been victimized, and what they should get in return, one
important distinction emerges: Ignaczak was a slave in Nazi
Germany, Belina toiled in the Soviet Union.
</P>
<P>
   Ignaczak, 82, is eligible for as much as to $6,500 in
compensation from Germany, which has pledged to redress the crimes
committed by the Nazis. Belina, 74, has not received so much as an
apology from Moscow.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Germans have recognized what they did and are paying the
victims. The Russians have recognized nothing,'' said Belina, who
spent six years in a Siberian labor camp.
</P>
<P>
   In the decade since Communist rule ended, Poland has established
itself as a stable democracy. But this nation of 38.5 million has
also been forced to grapple with the ghosts of a brutal 20th
century.
</P>
<P>
   About half the size of Texas, Poland sits between Russia and
Germany, in Europe's historical stomping ground, and has a long
history of being abused by its neighbors. In World War II, it was
subject to successive occupations by Germany and the Soviet Union.
And now, hundreds of thousands of ordinary people here, who
suffered under Nazi and Stalinist rule, want redress.
</P>
<P>
   The country has hundreds of thousands of victims like Ignaczak
and Belina. But sorting out who did what to whom, and who should
pay, has proven tricky. Germany, which has already paid $60 billion
in compensation for other war crimes, has now agreed to also pay
slave labor victims. Moscow, which sees its victory in World War II
as sacrosanct, will not even acknowledge the issue.
</P>
<P>
   ``The question with compensation is how far should it go and
where it should end,'' said Konstanty Gebert, a Polish newspaper
columnist. ``My worry is that the whole bloody history of the 20th
century will be turned into one giant litigation.''
</P>
<P>
   After Hitler and Stalin signed a secret treaty dividing up
Poland _ and Europe _ Nazi forces marched into Poland in 1939.
Soviet forces later attacked from the East, partitioning the
country into two occupied zones.
</P>
<P>
   Poles bravely resisted occupation _ and paid dearly. Some 6
million died at the hands of the Nazis, including 3 million Polish
Jews. To beef up its war machine, Germany also rounded up slave
laborers in countries it occupied. As many as 2.3 million of these
people are still alive, including 500,000 in Poland.
</P>
<P>
   For their part, the Soviets executed tens of thousands of
political, business and military leaders. The Soviets also deported
an estimated 1.5 million Poles, deemed not loyal enough to Moscow,
to labor camps. Most perished there, but about 100,000 are still
alive.
</P>
<P>
   In 1941, Hitler reneged on his treaty with Stalin and took over
all of Poland _ and held it until the Soviets moved in, in 1945.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier this year, the German government, and corporations that
used forced labor during the war, established a fund to compensate
victims across Eastern Europe. In Poland, each slave laborer is
eligible to receive between $3,250 and $6,500.
</P>
<P>
   Among these is Ignaczak, who sat patiently in the Warsaw offices
of the Foundation for Polish-German Reconciliation, which is
handling the payments. She clutched at a stack of decades-old
photographs and documents as she waited to file her claim.
</P>
<P>
   In 1941 the Nazis sent Ignaczak, then 22, to Germany to work on
a farm. For four years she worked 16-hour days, milking cows,
cleaning stables, and planting crops. She has suffered from a bad
back ever since. ``They treated the dogs better than they treated
us. When I got sick, they told me if I didn't want to work I could
go to a concentration camp.''
</P>
<P>
   No amount of money, she said, could make up for those years.
</P>
<P>
   ``I lost my health and my youth. Nothing can give this back,''
she said, wiping away tears.
</P>
<P>
   A few blocks away, Belina, 74, sat in the offices of the
Siberian Union, an advocacy group representing Poles deported to
the Soviet gulag. Belina was 14 in April 1940 when bayonet-wielding
Soviet soldiers showed up at his home. They marched him, his
parents and brother onto a train bound for a Siberian labor camp.
</P>
<P>
   They weren't allowed to return to Poland until 1946. Belina's
father, a Polish diplomat, died of tuberculosis in Soviet
captivity.
</P>
<P>
   Belina and other gulag survivors say they would also like a
German-style settlement for their suffering. The group has written
former Russian President Boris Yeltsin demanding compensation from
Moscow, and petitioned the Polish government to support their
efforts _ all in vain.
</P>
<P>
   ``This discussion has been going on for 10 years. We expect
nothing from Russia. They just say that their own citizens also
suffered under the communists,'' said Edward Duchnowski, who in
1940 was exiled to a Soviet labor camp at age 10. Duchnowski's
father was executed for refusing to renounce his Polish
citizenship.
</P>
<P>
   Jacek Sasin, director of Poland's Department of Veterans'
Affairs, said the Polish government adds $47 a month to gulag
survivors' pensions, and $238 a month to the pensions of those
whose health was severely damaged in Russian camps. ``Of course the
Russians should pay. What they did was similar to what the Germans
did,'' Sasin said. He added that the Polish goverment has raised
the matter with Moscow, which refuses to discuss the issue.
</P>
<P>
   The Russian Embassy in Poland said it was not Moscow's issue _
these days. ``This was done by the Soviet Union not by Russia,
which was only one of 15 republics in the USSR,'' said Pavel
Dyechenko, press attache for the Russian Embassy in Warsaw. He said
that anybody, including foreign nationals, who can prove that they
were repressed by Soviet authorities can request redress from
Moscow, but the requests are decided on an individual basis. He
could not provide information about any foreigners who have
received compensation.
</P>
<P>
   Moscow has tried to improve its relations with Warsaw. In April,
President Vladimir V. Putin telephoned his Polish counterpart,
President Aleksander Kwasniewski, and offered to assist in
investigating the execution in 1940 of 5,000 Polish army officers
by Stalin's secret police.
</P>
<P>
   Polish officials say they do not expect cash-strapped Russia to
offer a German-style settlement in the near future. But gulag
survivors say they would at least like an apology for the suffering
they endured. ``It isn't just the money,'' Belina said. ``It is a
question of our dignity.''

EVEN MEAGER AID WANES FOR CHECHEN REBELS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DAVID FILIPOV  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   KARABULAK, Russia _ A small spot on the bare wooden floor of a
tent passes for home for Selima Dzhebayeva and her five small
children. That's all the room there is, because 46 people have to
sleep in a space no larger than an average American living room.
</P>
<P>
   The canvas over their heads, like most tents in the refugee
camps across the border from war-ravaged Chechnya, is threadbare
and torn. With cold weather on the way, this is no place to spend
the winter. But when Dzhebayeva asked for a new tent, camp
authorities told her to go home to Chechnya instead.
</P>
<P>
   By cutting back on aid for the refugees and repairs to the camps
in Ingushetia, the Russians have been encouraging many to return,
the refugees say.
</P>
<P>
   But no place in Chechnya is completely safe from nightly raids
and bomb attacks by separatist rebels, or from the Russians'
retaliatory house-to-house searches that Chechens say often end in
extortion, detention, and torture of civilians.
</P>
<P>
   And Dzhebayeva has no place to go: She lost her house in the
Chechen capital of Grozny to the war, and possibly her husband, who
disappeared in March. Bad as things are in the camp, she is not
about to risk what she still has _ her children _ by taking them
back to the conflict zone.
</P>
<P>
   This is the dilemma faced by an estimated 170,000 people, mostly
women and children, who are ekeing out a frustrating and often
humiliating existence in the makeshift shelters in Ingushetia, the
tiny and impoverished region west of Chechnya that has taken in
most of the refugees from a year of fighting.
</P>
<P>
   Their hardship is all but ignored in the rest of Russia, which
recently marked several grim anniversaries of events that provided
a groundswell of support for Moscow's military campaign in
Chechnya: the apartment bombings in Moscow and other cities that
killed more than 300 people and two bloody incursions by
Chechen-led fighters into Dagestan, the region east of Chechnya.
Authorities blamed the blasts on Chechen rebels, though to this day
no one has been convicted of setting off the explosions.
</P>
<P>
   Russia does not keep track of civilian casualties in Chechnya,
but official casualty figures for its own troops _ last week 19
died and 90 were wounded _ reflect the level of violence. And the
rebels' terrorist-style attacks often claim civilian victims, such
as the woman and her infant daughter killed by a truck bomb at a
market in Grozny last week.
</P>
<P>
   Avoiding the violence is made even more difficult by the
abundance of land mines scattered around the outskirts of villages,
said Rabu Azdayeva, who works for a relief agency that is trying to
help clear the mines. Often, she said, the Russian military clears
fields for farmers to plow, only to have civilians detonate mines
they missed or new ones placed by rebels. Two weeks ago, she said,
10 civilians in a southern town were killed in mine blasts.
</P>
<P>
   Mines are not the only danger. There is also Russian artillery,
a constant rumble that can be heard loud and clear in the camps.
Refugees complain that villagers foraging for firewood and food in
wooded areas in the southern foothills are often mistaken for rebel
forces by Russian troops manning artillery positions in the plains
south of Grozny.
</P>
<P>
   ``Basically, day and night shells flew overhead,'' said Buvaisar
Akhmadov, who returned with his family to Chechnya in May,
believing his town was safe. ``Sometimes they fell and blew up near
our house. When four villagers were killed, we decided it was
better to live in Ingushetia, even if it is not comfortable.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Not comfortable'' is how Akhmadov describes a place known as
The Deadend Railroad, a refugee camp in Karabulak fashioned out of
a passenger train. More than 5,400 people lived in trains like this
one last year, often without heat or electricity. Ingush officials
are determined to find them someplace else to stay this year.
</P>
<P>
   But where? There's no room at the farm where 2,000 refugees are
sharing stables with cattle and horses. The United Nations Office
of High Commissioner for Refugees has proposed building a new camp,
but it would be able to accommodate only 12,000 people. Valery
Kuksa, who is in charge of the camps in Ingushetia, said the region
can safely take in only 25,000 of the 140,000 registered refugees
(the actual number is believed to be closer to 170,000) this
winter. The government wants the rest to return to Chechnya by Oct.
1, he told reporters in August. But Kuksa acknowledged that ``few
will go.''
</P>
<P>
   Many Chechens who had returned home earlier this year are
doubling back to Ingushetia, said Ali Sediyev of the
Russian-Chechen Friendship Society, which provides assistance to
the refugees. Sediyev said the administration of Ingushetia,
strapped for funds and hoping to persuade refugees to go home,
stopped serving free food at the camps for a six-week period over
the summer. It also has stopped registering new arrivals as
refugees.
</P>
<P>
   ``But people are not staying here because of free food,'' he
said. ``There is no where for them to go.''
</P>
<P>
   None of the villages wrecked by the fighting has been rebuilt.
There is no work; few businesses or farms are operating. Even
Chechens who have something to return to have a problem getting
there; refugees say Russian troops manning checkpoints routinely
extort bribes to let them through. Earlier this month, Russian
troops detained, beat, and extorted $600 from Ruslan Musayev, an
ethnic Chechen who works as an Associated Press reporter. When the
troops figured out who he was, they let him go.
</P>
<P>
   But it does not always end that way. Nearly every refugee has a
relative, friend, or loved one who has been detained by Russian
troops, who say they are checking for rebel fighters and set
everyone else free. But Chechens say the men are set free only when
their relatives pay ransom.
</P>
<P>
   Pro-Moscow Chechen politicians have begun to speak out against
the actions of Russian troops, warning of new uprisings.
</P>
<P>
   ``If these aliens in ski-masks, these werewolves in uniform, do
not stop torturing the Chechen people, the people will start
defending themselves,'' said Aslanbek Aslakhanov, Chechnya's
representative to the Russian parliament, at a hearing Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   A senior Russian officer, Colonel General Valery Manilov,
acknowledged that some troops have overstepped their bounds and
vowed that mistreatment of civilians would be prosecuted.
</P>
<P>
   But too often, Chechens say, it ends the way it did for
Dzhebayeva's husband, Magomed, 47, who was arrested on March 10.
For five months Dzhebayeva has tried to find him, or even find out
where he is being held. No one has been able to tell her.
</P>
<P>
   Chechens say men ``disappear'' this way all the time. Even
high-profile politicians simply vanish into thin air. Rebel leaders
claim that the speaker of the separatists' parliament, Ruslan
Alikhadzhiyev, died in a Moscow jail this month after being
tortured. The Russians admit that they arrested Alikhadzhiev in
May. Though they deny having any information about his death, they
also say they have no idea where he is.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are so many women looking for their men,'' Dzhebayeva
said.
</P>
<P>
   At that moment, a passenger jet roared overhead on its way to a
nearby airport. Her youngest daughter burst into tears.
</P>
<P>
   ``Another echo of war,'' someone in the tent said. ``All the
children here are afraid of planes.''

 &UR; (Distributed by the New York Times Special Features) &LR;  &QC;
<P>
   Perhaps something good has come out of the recent fuel crisis
after all. The protests over high oil prices over the past two
weeks are now forcing many European governments to rethink their
taxes on fuel.
</P>
<P>
   In America too, the threat of a winter heating-oil crisis has
led to a noisy debate over energy policy.
</P>
<P>
   In principle, this is good news. These countries' confused
energy-taxation regimes need some serious scrutiny. But that, of
course, is not what is happening.
</P>
<P>
   Europe's governments are thinking only about how they can
respond to demands for lower gas prices without looking as though
they are giving in to blackmail or losing too much revenue.
</P>
<P>
   The French government made things awkward by caving in, and now
other governments are under pressure to follow suit. Should they do
so? Not right now, certainly. Such a move would send the wrong
signal to the throwers of bricks and the blockers of roads _ that,
as in France, street protests will be rewarded with speedy
concessions.
</P>
<P>
   It would also send the wrong message to OPEC _ that price hikes
will not result in lower consumption (as market forces would
dictate), because it can always count on governments to cut taxes
to reduce the price volatility that might hurt their economies. For
OPEC, then, there would be no downside to pushing up the price of
oil.
</P>
<P>
   In the longer term, however, those governments that tax gasoline
most heavily should think about bringing rates down _ but only as
part of a rethink of their energy-tax policies.
</P>
<P>
   Gas taxes are designed to achieve three things: to reduce
congestion, to reduce pollution and to raise money. They are not
much good at achieving two out of those three objectives.
</P>
<P>
   At first glance, governments seem justified in using gas taxes
to tackle congestion. After all, guzzling gasoline leads to clogged
roads, and it seems to make sense to price fuel to reflect that
cost to society.
</P>
<P>
   The snag is that gas taxes are too blunt an instrument for the
task. Urban car use creates more congestion than rural car use, but
gas taxes do not distinguish between the two.
</P>
<P>
   If there is no public transport available, then gas taxes make
people poorer without changing their behavior. So piling on
ever-higher gas taxes as the main weapon to fight congestion makes
little sense.
</P>
<P>
   Road pricing, taxes on urban parking and other targeted measures
would be far better at tackling the traffic jams that occur at
particular times and in particular places.
</P>
<P>
   Greenery too seems an appropriate goal of gas taxation. That is
because cars produce local air pollution, which damages human
health and the environment, and also produce greenhouse gases,
which contribute to global warming. Congestion makes this worse, by
concentrating the polluters in a particular spot.
</P>
<P>
   Given these social costs, it seems reasonable to tax gasoline to
discourage its use. Yet taxes should be proportionate to the
problems caused _ and gas actually causes lower social costs than
some other fossil-fuels.
</P>
<P>
   A better way forward is a carbon tax, which penalizes dirtier
fuels like coal more than cleaner ones like natural gas. Yet, at
the moment, governments have got things exactly backwards: they
subsidize the filthiest fuel and put roadblocks in the way of the
cleanest.
</P>
<P>
   Britain, Spain and Germany subsidize coal, while America grants
special exemptions to old coal-fired power stations so that they do
not have to meet emissions laws.
</P>
<P>
   Clean alternatives face regulatory and other obstacles, while
gasoline, which is less polluting than coal, attracts
disproportionately high taxes.
</P>
<P>
   Gas taxes are certainly good at their third job _ raising money.
Road pricing or carbon taxes could replace some of that lost
revenue, but new taxes are always hard to impose, because those who
lose out oppose them and those who benefit keep quiet. Still,
current levels of fuel taxes are going to be hard to sustain.
</P>
<P>
   As they review their regimes in the light of their troubles,
governments may decide that the alternatives are economically
better, and politically no worse. &QL;

<P>
   Perhaps something good has come out of the recent fuel crisis
after all. The protests over high oil prices over the past two
weeks are now forcing many European governments to rethink their
taxes on fuel.
</P>
<P>
   In America too, the threat of a winter heating-oil crisis has
led to a noisy debate over energy policy.
</P>
<P>
   In principle, this is good news. These countries' confused
energy-taxation regimes need some serious scrutiny. But that, of
course, is not what is happening.
</P>
<P>
   Europe's governments are thinking only about how they can
respond to demands for lower gas prices without looking as though
they are giving in to blackmail or losing too much revenue.
</P>
<P>
   The French government made things awkward by caving in, and now
other governments are under pressure to follow suit. Should they do
so? Not right now, certainly. Such a move would send the wrong
signal to the throwers of bricks and the blockers of roads _ that,
as in France, street protests will be rewarded with speedy
concessions.
</P>
<P>
   It would also send the wrong message to OPEC _ that price hikes
will not result in lower consumption (as market forces would
dictate), because it can always count on governments to cut taxes
to reduce the price volatility that might hurt their economies. For
OPEC, then, there would be no downside to pushing up the price of
oil.
</P>
<P>
   In the longer term, however, those governments that tax gasoline
most heavily should think about bringing rates down _ but only as
part of a rethink of their energy-tax policies.
</P>
<P>
   Gas taxes are designed to achieve three things: to reduce
congestion, to reduce pollution and to raise money. They are not
much good at achieving two out of those three objectives.
</P>
<P>
   At first glance, governments seem justified in using gas taxes
to tackle congestion. After all, guzzling gasoline leads to clogged
roads, and it seems to make sense to price fuel to reflect that
cost to society.
</P>
<P>
   The snag is that gas taxes are too blunt an instrument for the
task. Urban car use creates more congestion than rural car use, but
gas taxes do not distinguish between the two.
</P>
<P>
   If there is no public transport available, then gas taxes make
people poorer without changing their behavior. So piling on
ever-higher gas taxes as the main weapon to fight congestion makes
little sense.
</P>
<P>
   Road pricing, taxes on urban parking and other targeted measures
would be far better at tackling the traffic jams that occur at
particular times and in particular places.
</P>
<P>
   Greenery too seems an appropriate goal of gas taxation. That is
because cars produce local air pollution, which damages human
health and the environment, and also produce greenhouse gases,
which contribute to global warming. Congestion makes this worse, by
concentrating the polluters in a particular spot.
</P>
<P>
   Given these social costs, it seems reasonable to tax gasoline to
discourage its use. Yet taxes should be proportionate to the
problems caused _ and gas actually causes lower social costs than
some other fossil-fuels.
</P>
<P>
   A better way forward is a carbon tax, which penalizes dirtier
fuels like coal more than cleaner ones like natural gas. Yet, at
the moment, governments have got things exactly backwards: they
subsidize the filthiest fuel and put roadblocks in the way of the
cleanest.
</P>
<P>
   Britain, Spain and Germany subsidize coal, while America grants
special exemptions to old coal-fired power stations so that they do
not have to meet emissions laws.
</P>
<P>
   Clean alternatives face regulatory and other obstacles, while
gasoline, which is less polluting than coal, attracts
disproportionately high taxes.
</P>
<P>
   Gas taxes are certainly good at their third job _ raising money.
Road pricing or carbon taxes could replace some of that lost
revenue, but new taxes are always hard to impose, because those who
lose out oppose them and those who benefit keep quiet. Still,
current levels of fuel taxes are going to be hard to sustain.
</P>
<P>
   As they review their regimes in the light of their troubles,
governments may decide that the alternatives are economically
better, and politically no worse. &QL;

<P>
   Nowhere in Latin America has democracy been more openly flouted
this year than in Peru. By standing for a third, constitutionally
dubious, term after a decade in power, and then staging a deeply
flawed election, Alberto Fujimori succeeded only in dividing his
country and antagonizing the outside world, notably the United
States.
</P>
<P>
   So Fujimori's sudden call for fresh elections, this time ruling
himself out as a candidate, is welcome. It offers Peru the chance
to make the fresh democratic start that it needs. But there are
plenty of dangers and uncertainties ahead.
</P>
<P>
   It was always going to be a stretch for Fujimori to govern Peru
for another five years amid international opprobrium. Indeed, it
has taken less than two months of his new term for his regime to
hit a brick wall. Sorting out the wreckage could be tricky and will
take a lot longer.
</P>
<P>
   Fujimori built his autocracy on the support of the armed forces.
In the shadows, Vladimiro Montesinos, a cashiered former army
captain, ran the powerful intelligence service, and exercised
political control: through threats and rewards, he ensured the
quiescence of Congress, the courts, the television stations and
most of the press.
</P>
<P>
   Now he has become a political liability. First came a scandal
involving the sale of rifles from Peru to Colombia's guerrillas.
Then came the leaking last week of a videotape which showed
Montesinos offering $15,000 to an opposition congressman, one of
more than a dozen who have defected to the government.
</P>
<P>
   This provided irrefutable evidence of the corruption and
chicanery through which Fujimori's regime has clung to power, and
forced the president to announce that he would ``de-activate'' the
intelligence service.
</P>
<P>
   Is Montesinos still in league with Fujimori, or plotting with
the generals to overthrow him? Either way, the fear is that the
army may try to prevent the holding of a genuinely democratic
election.
</P>
<P>
   As outsiders need to keep reminding them, the armed forces as an
institution ought to have no place in politics. Ideally, new
commanders should be appointed as soon as possible: the existing
ones are tainted by their dealings with Montesinos.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, Peru's opposition is right to insist that Montesinos
should be put on trial. But if that is to do much good, Peru also
needs an independent prosecution service and judiciary. All this
will take time.
</P>
<P>
   Even so, Montesinos's removal could in itself help to create
some of the conditions for a genuinely free and fair election, by
allowing the media to operate with less state interference. The
discredited electoral authority, too, needs a radical overhaul and
a new boss.
</P>
<P>
   Can this be done quickly? Can it be done at all?
</P>
<P>
   Whether a fresh election is held within four months, as
Alejandro Toledo, the opposition leader, wants, or in March or May,
as ministers have suggested, is less important than creating the
democratic framework to ensure that the election this time is fair.
</P>
<P>
   In this, much still depends on Fujimori. But there are doubts as
to his authority, and his intentions. He has implied that he wishes
to return as president in 2006. Meanwhile he may be hoping to
retain power, perhaps even with Montesinos, after a cosmetic
election to install a crony.
</P>
<P>
   This week's events have shown how unstable Fujimori's regime has
become. Outsiders should do all they can to encourage a genuine
democratic transition in Peru.
</P>
<P>
   Ideally, that requires a transitional administration, involving
both government and opposition leaders. Failing that, talks on
democratic reforms begun last month under the Organization of
American States (OAS) should move forward more quickly.
</P>
<P>
   Transitions from authoritarian rule are invariably messy. At
best, Peru faces several months of instability. That is the price
of Fujimori's folly in trying to steal an election in order to
prolong his rule. But that price would be worth paying if the
result of the next election were a more democratic Peru. &QL;

<P>
   (UNDATED) _ One of the good things about politicians is that you
can poke fun at them. Humor helps to puncture pomposity, alleviate
boredom and reconcile the governed to being bossed around. David
Letterman and Jay Leno are as essential to the political process as
the Brookings Institution and the Heritage Foundation.
</P>
<P>
   But can the mocking go too far? And can it become so one-sided
that it prejudices the election?
</P>
<P>
   At the moment, all the sniggering not only risks creating the
impression that George W. Bush is unfit for office _ which is going
too far _ but also of obscuring the real battlegrounds of the
election.
</P>
<P>
   There are plenty of good reasons to laugh at W. He comes from an
eccentric social class, where boys become head cheerleaders, grown
men are called things like Poppy and Prescott, and everybody ends
up as governor of some state or other.
</P>
<P>
   He has difficulty remembering the names of leaders of obscure
foreign countries like Pakistan. And he has an extraordinary talent
for mangling the English language.
</P>
<P>
   This is not just a matter of mangling words _ turning
``subliminal'' into ``subliminable'' or ``analysis'' into
``analyzation'' _ but also of mangling whole sentences.
</P>
<P>
   Bush is a man who maintains that ``we ought to make the pie
higher,'' and who knows ``how hard it is for you to put food on
your family.'' But are such Bushisms really so bad as to eclipse
everything else?
</P>
<P>
   Mangled syntax does not automatically denote stupidity. Bush
scored in the top 10 percent of the country in his SATs _ in the
same region as Al Gore.
</P>
<P>
   Nor is high intelligence the most important qualification for
the presidency. Richard Nixon and Bill Clinton were both
intellectually outstanding; Ronald Reagan was not.
</P>
<P>
   Reagan was famously a great communicator. But some of the most
articulate politicians have had mediocre careers: think of Adlai
Stevenson and Herbert Hoover. And some of the most inarticulate
have been successes. George Bush senior, who suffers from exactly
the same tongue-twisting problem as his son, grows in stature.
</P>
<P>
   Dwight Eisenhower said things like, ``I do not engage in
personalities.'' Richard J. Daley, Chicago's greatest mayor (and,
incidentally, the father of Gore's campaign manager) was legendary
for verbal infelicities, such as his desire to see people ``reach
greater and greater platitudes.''
</P>
<P>
   What matters, surely, is Bush's record rather than his syntax.
Once again, he has certainly made mistakes, not least in choosing a
lame running mate and engaging in a futile debate about the
debates.
</P>
<P>
   His tax plan is a hard sell _ too generous to the rich and too
risky for an economy that is already operating at full throttle.
</P>
<P>
   And his decision to retool his campaign after Labor Day to
appeal to the great American middle class _ about 70 percent of the
population _ raises the question of who he was trying to appeal to
beforehand.
</P>
<P>
   But these mistakes need to be weighed against four things. The
most obvious is that Bush has a respectable record as governor of
Texas. He can point to legitimate achievements, and not just in
cutting taxes.
</P>
<P>
   Second, Bush's instincts as a party manager are generally sound.
The only chance that the Republicans have of thriving in the long
term is to make themselves more open to minorities and immigrants.
This will clearly take time, and will involve some theatrics, like
the somewhat forced multiculturalism of the Republican Convention.
</P>
<P>
   But a Bush administration is likely to have both Colin Powell
and Condoleezza Rice in senior positions, giving blacks a higher
profile than they have in the current Clinton administration.
</P>
<P>
   Third, Bush has produced some bold policies. He has had the
courage to touch the ``third rail'' of American politics, Social
Security reform. He has also had the ingenuity to raid Democratic
think-tanks for ideas. And he is finally giving his disparate ideas
some coherence.
</P>
<P>
   He stands for markets against government, he argues, for
innovation against stasis, for using the surplus to create new
social services rather than just to patch up old ones.
</P>
<P>
   Spin, of course; but pretty good spin.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, Bush is sailing against difficult winds. It is
exceedingly hard to unseat an incumbent in a time of peace and
unparalleled prosperity. It is particularly hard when the issues
favor the other side.
</P>
<P>
   In the 1980s, the Republicans won on issues like crime and the
Cold War; now they have to fight on health, education and Social
Security, where Democrats enjoy a double-digit lead in the polls.
</P>
<P>
   So why is Bush being treated as a laughingstock? The Republicans
are quick to blame the liberal bias of the media.
</P>
<P>
   More than 90 percent of journalists voted for Clinton-Gore in
1996, and most strongly disapprove of Bush's positions on abortion
and the death penalty.
</P>
<P>
   Mike Murphy, John McCain's adjutant during the primaries, points
out that the Gore team has been ``playing the media like a
violin.'' Every time Bush tries to talk about the issues, the press
corps interrupts him with loud questions about trivia instead.
</P>
<P>
   The obvious rejoinder to this is that until recently the press's
main target for abuse was Gore, for reinventing himself as an alpha
male and dubbing illegal fund-raising ``community outreach.''
</P>
<P>
   Most journalists were surprised by how well Gore's snog 'n'
speech at the Democratic Convention went down with the American
people.
</P>
<P>
   The American media's main fault is that of the playground bully:
whoever is losing gets the bulk of the derision.
</P>
<P>
   Republican charges of bias will have more sting if the press
fails now to chase Gore for fabricating a story about the relative
prices of medicines being consumed by his dog and his mother-in-law
(hardly Pulitzer stuff, but surely a more egregious sin than Bush's
over-covered one of making an obscene reference to a hostile
journalist.)
</P>
<P>
   None of this should be taken as an apologia pro Bush. There are
plenty of good reasons to reject him as president, but not many
being considered by the American press at the moment.
</P>
<P>
   At its heart, the election offers a choice between two
well-qualified, if not outstanding, candidates, and between two
contrasting philosophies, one rooted in the protective power of the
government, the other in the liberating effects of the market.
</P>
<P>
   A decent contest to get your teeth into. Unless of course you
are Bush, and you have to take your foot out of your mouth first. &QL;

&HT;     FIVE STARS FOR A PRIESTLY FILMMAKER 
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     Commentary  
 &HT;     (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 &HT;     By STEPHANIE SALTER  
 &HT;     c.2000 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ Two weeks ago, the Catholic Church and
filmmaking lost a smart and tender friend. The Rev. Ellwood E.
Kieser died in Los Angeles of colon cancer at the age of 71.
</P>
<P>
   The founder of a nonprofit movie company that is run by and
named for his clerical order _ Paulist Productions _ Kieser was a
television and film producer whose efforts brought him six Emmy
Awards.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps his finest hour was as executive producer of the 1989
feature film, ``Romero,'' which starred the late Raul Julia as El
Salvador's martyred archbishop.
</P>
<P>
   ``Romero'' isn't just a good religious, historical or political
movie; it is a very fine film.
</P>
<P>
   I met ``Bud'' Kieser (pronounced KYE-zer) in late-autumn 1996.
He and I both had brought bruised hearts to the Redwoods, an
isolated but healing Cistercian monastery near Northern
California's Lost Coast.
</P>
<P>
   My misery was caused by a doomed love affair. Kieser, a
lumbering, bespectacled man who stood 6-feet-7-inches, had been
wounded by some terrible reviews of his new movie, ``Entertaining
Angels: The Dorothy Day Story.''
</P>
<P>
   (Harbinger of ``West Wing'' successes to come, the film starred
Moira Kelly as Day and Martin Sheen as her mentor, the anarchist
and visionary Peter Maurin.)
</P>
<P>
   Speaking to the dozen or so cloistered nuns and handful of
retreatants like me, Kieser said he felt as if he'd just watched a
child of his get attacked.
</P>
<P>
   Like ``Romero,'' Kieser and Paulist Productions had to scratch
and dig for every penny they got to shoot and distribute
``Entertaining Angels.'' Hardly based on a sure-fire box office
formula _ liberated, socialist single mom finds God and ministers
to the poor for 60 years _ the Day movie went almost immediately
into video release.
</P>
<P>
   After Kieser's talk, a puckish Trappist monk led me to the
monastery's library and pulled out a copy of Kieser's
autobiography, then-titled, ``Hollywood Priest.'' (It has since
been renamed ``The Spiritual Journey of a Show Business Priest.'')
</P>
<P>
   ``The movie and TV stuff is interesting,'' he said, ``but the
really good part is the chapter called `Genevieve.'''
</P>
<P>
   The monk was right. The movie and TV stuff were interesting.
Especially Kieser's memories of his 23-year stint as the producer
of the television drama series, ``Insight.''
</P>
<P>
   Among the actors who worked in that message-based show were
Walter Matthau, Carol Burnett, Jane Wyman, Patty Duke and Bob
Newhart. During the 1979 season, a bearded, hippie-looking Martin
Sheen and comedian Flip Wilson took turns playing God.
</P>
<P>
   Equally interesting was Kieser's description of the filming of
``Romero,'' which ended in a wrap party and Mass for 350 cast and
crew members and their families. Raul Julia, who had deliberately
fallen away from the Catholic Church, was so spiritually touched,
he made his first confession in years and took communion from
Kieser.
</P>
<P>
   The monk was right about ``Genevieve,'' too.
</P>
<P>
   The fictional name for a nun Kieser met in 1964 and fell in love
with in 1967, Genevieve turned out to be the young priest's
crucible.
</P>
<P>
   Though never consummated, their love affair led to Genevieve
asking for dispensation from her vows and leaving her order. When
Kieser got to the same crossroads of choice, he could not follow
her.
</P>
<P>
   Yes, ``in the context of our love for each other I was coming
alive and becoming myself in a new and deeper way,'' he wrote.
</P>
<P>
   But then he asked himself (and God), ``Who is Bud Kieser?'' The
answer came back clear and strong:
</P>
<P>
   ``He is that unique human being who in the pit of his being has
been loved by God in a unique way, and who, from the pit of his
being, has tried to accept that love and respond to it. . . .
</P>
<P>
   ``God had spoken in the depths of my soul, and He had invited me
to be a priest. And I, wanting to respond to His love, accepted his
invitation. . . .
</P>
<P>
   ``Priest is the essential expression of my relationship with
God, and it is my essential way of relating to other people. It
constitutes my identity. I am essentially priest. Priest is who I
am.''
</P>
<P>
   And priest is who Bud Kieser stayed. In Hollywood, of all
places. Doing lunch, raising capital and making movies _ all for
love of the ultimate studio head.
</P>
<P>
   For his life's work, these are the reviews he deserves:
</P>
<P>
   Two thumbs-up!
</P>
<P>
   Bravo!
</P>
<P>
   Five stars.

<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ Robert Hughes looked like any other eighth
grader the other day as he walked along with his mother, bookbag
strapped to his back.
</P>
<P>
   Yet it wasn't a school day but a Saturday afternoon, and he
wasn't trudging across the schoolyard but a scorching airport
tarmac at the end of a 6,076-mile field trip. For the preceding six
days, his classroom had been a campaign plane, his school bus a
Secret Service motorcade, his lecturer the Republican presidential
nominee, his main course ``Campaign 2000.''
</P>
<P>
   Hughes is the 13-year-old son of George W. Bush's communications
director, Karen P. Hughes. Faced with the prospect of spending the
election year separated from her only child, and surprised by his
interest in national politics, Hughes decided to take Robert out of
school this fall and along with her on the campaign trail.
</P>
<P>
   Using materials provided by his teachers and the University of
Texas, she is teaching the honor-roll student in between
proofreading her boss's speeches, dealing with the national media,
and delivering the campaign's message-of-the-day in the race
against Democrat Al Gore.
</P>
<P>
   So far, mother, son, and presidential candidate are thrilled
with how it's working out.
</P>
<P>
   ``The thing I've liked best so far was the military history
lesson from General Schwarzkopf,'' Robert said, referring to a
visit to Dayton, Ohio, where he listened to Persian Gulf War
commanders Norman Schwarzkopf and Colin Powell talk about military
preparedness.
</P>
<P>
   His mother said: ``A presidential campaign is a unique
experience. . . . It's a wonderful geography lesson and political
lesson and history lesson all at once.''
</P>
<P>
   Most supportive is Bush himself, who cleared a seat in his
airplane's staff cabin so Robert could tag along with mom. She is
one of the trio of top Bush advisers known as the ``Iron
Triangle.''
</P>
<P>
   ``One of the nicest things about my campaign is to watch Karen
and her son share an experience like this,'' said Bush, himself the
product of a political family, as his plane flew home Saturday from
Florida. ``The idea that she could take a liability for herself _
being away from her son all year _ and turn it into a positive
experience like this is really a credit to her.''
</P>
<P>
   The Texas governor was equally complimentary of his teenage
sidekick.
</P>
<P>
   ``Robert is not like a lot of other 13-year-olds. He's mature,
he's a very good listener, and he's learning a lot about commitment
and discipline and disappointment and joy. And he's getting to see
his mom work. She's one of the best in the business, and he's
getting to see firsthand what a powerful person she is and how good
she is at her job.''
</P>
<P>
   The idea of Robert forsaking the classroom for the campaign
trail took root last winter, when he traded the warmth of Texas for
the bitter cold of New Hampshire to sample the primary campaign.
Soon he was riding in the state trooper's car at the head of the
motorcade and checking out the view through the lens of a $50,000
CNN video camera.
</P>
<P>
   He also watched firsthand as Bush reacted to the news he had
lost the primary to his Republican rival, US Senator John McCain of
Arizona.
</P>
<P>
   Last spring, Robert's father, Jerry Hughes, spoke to the
principal at the Hill Country Middle School outside Austin to see
if road-schooling would be possible under the state's home school
law. It was. In August, after Robert got his teacher assignments,
his mother wrote to each instructor and proposed the idea of
teaching him herself.
</P>
<P>
   ``I said I knew we couldn't replicate everything you do in a
classroom in a campaign airplane, but our goal was to keep up with
the classwork and the major projects,'' she said.'
</P>
<P>
   The response was enthusiastic.
</P>
<P>
   Each teacher gave her the class syllabus or a handwritten list
of the subjects being covered this fall. The school district loaned
her the appropriate textbooks, from ``The Story of America''
history book to a language arts workbook.
</P>
<P>
   Some of the classwork dovetails nicely with the campaign
environment. One assignment covered quotations, so Robert practiced
full and partial quotes by writing about one of the governor's
speeches. He spiced the project up by interviewing Bush's ad maker,
Mark McKinnon.
</P>
<P>
   The biggest trouble spot was algebra. Robert is taking 9th-grade
level math, which is about eight grade levels above his mother's
expertise, or so she jokes. She decided to take a pass on teaching
him and enrolled Robert in a University of Texas correspondence
course.
</P>
<P>
   On the road, Robert and his mother share a hotel room. Wakeup
call is sometimes as early as 6 a.m., so there's not a lot of
sleeping in. Each day he dresses in khakis and a print shirt, but
unlike his classmates, he also affixes a staff pin from the Secret
Service to his lapel.
</P>
<P>
   Hughes tries to make sure her son does his algebra in the
morning, before the day's events overtake them. Robert goes through
the rest of his lessons as the entourage moves from city to city.
His bookbag rides in the overhead storage bin.
</P>
<P>
   While Robert spends most of his day with adults, he says he
catches up with his friends on weekends and enjoys his campaign
companions during the workweek. ``There's a lot of young adults on
the campaign,'' he said, his smile showing his braces.
</P>
<P>
   The adults are also entertaining. When his mother walks back to
speak with reporters, Robert often tags along, kneeling on a seat
beside her as she looks over a seatback to talk to the crowd.
Sometimes she turns to him to refresh her memory about details from
the private meetings they have attended.
</P>
<P>
   Throughout the year, Robert has met a number of celebrities and
TV figures. On Friday night, it was ``Hardball'' host Chris
Matthews at a rally outside Miami.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's really interesting,'' he said. ``Sometimes they're a lot
different (from their TV image) and sometimes they're exactly the
same.''
</P>
<P>
   But, perhaps reflecting his mother's job, he said his most
eye-opening lesson from the trail is ``how one little thing can
turn into a huge thing'' through the amplification of the media.
</P>
<P>
   Monday, Robert and his mother headed back out. The campaign
spent the day in Beaverton, Ore., and Spokane, Wash., before moving
on to California for two days. After an evening home for debate
preparation, Bush hits the road again Thursday and Friday, destined
for the Midwest battleground states.
</P>
<P>
   The Hugheses will be there every step of the way, as they will
through November 7. Should Bush win, the family will likely head
off to Washington in January. Should Gore prevail, Robert will
finish out the year at Hill Country and graduate with his
classmates.
</P>
<P>
   Asked about that prospect, he smiles and says, ``It won't be as
fun, but. . .''

   (UNDATED) _ One of the good things about politicians is that you
can poke fun at them. Humor helps to puncture pomposity, alleviate
boredom and reconcile the governed to being bossed around. David
Letterman and Jay Leno are as essential to the political process as
the Brookings Institution and the Heritage Foundation.
</P>
<P>
   But can the mocking go too far? And can it become so one-sided
that it prejudices the election?
</P>
<P>
   At the moment, all the sniggering not only risks creating the
impression that George W. Bush is unfit for office _ which is going
too far _ but also of obscuring the real battlegrounds of the
election.
</P>
<P>
   There are plenty of good reasons to laugh at W. He comes from an
eccentric social class, where boys become head cheerleaders, grown
men are called things like Poppy and Prescott, and everybody ends
up as governor of some state or other.
</P>
<P>
   He has difficulty remembering the names of leaders of obscure
foreign countries like Pakistan. And he has an extraordinary talent
for mangling the English language.
</P>
<P>
   This is not just a matter of mangling words _ turning
``subliminal'' into ``subliminable'' or ``analysis'' into
``analyzation'' _ but also of mangling whole sentences.
</P>
<P>
   Bush is a man who maintains that ``we ought to make the pie
higher,'' and who knows ``how hard it is for you to put food on
your family.'' But are such Bushisms really so bad as to eclipse
everything else?
</P>
<P>
   Mangled syntax does not automatically denote stupidity. Bush
scored in the top 10 percent of the country in his SATs _ in the
same region as Al Gore.
</P>
<P>
   Nor is high intelligence the most important qualification for
the presidency. Richard Nixon and Bill Clinton were both
intellectually outstanding; Ronald Reagan was not.
</P>
<P>
   Reagan was famously a great communicator. But some of the most
articulate politicians have had mediocre careers: think of Adlai
Stevenson and Herbert Hoover. And some of the most inarticulate
have been successes. George Bush senior, who suffers from exactly
the same tongue-twisting problem as his son, grows in stature.
</P>
<P>
   Dwight Eisenhower said things like, ``I do not engage in
personalities.'' Richard J. Daley, Chicago's greatest mayor (and,
incidentally, the father of Gore's campaign manager) was legendary
for verbal infelicities, such as his desire to see people ``reach
greater and greater platitudes.''
</P>
<P>
   What matters, surely, is Bush's record rather than his syntax.
Once again, he has certainly made mistakes, not least in choosing a
lame running mate and engaging in a futile debate about the
debates.
</P>
<P>
   His tax plan is a hard sell _ too generous to the rich and too
risky for an economy that is already operating at full throttle.
</P>
<P>
   And his decision to retool his campaign after Labor Day to
appeal to the great American middle class _ about 70 percent of the
population _ raises the question of who he was trying to appeal to
beforehand.
</P>
<P>
   But these mistakes need to be weighed against four things. The
most obvious is that Bush has a respectable record as governor of
Texas. He can point to legitimate achievements, and not just in
cutting taxes.
</P>
<P>
   Second, Bush's instincts as a party manager are generally sound.
The only chance that the Republicans have of thriving in the long
term is to make themselves more open to minorities and immigrants.
This will clearly take time, and will involve some theatrics, like
the somewhat forced multiculturalism of the Republican Convention.
</P>
<P>
   But a Bush administration is likely to have both Colin Powell
and Condoleezza Rice in senior positions, giving blacks a higher
profile than they have in the current Clinton administration.
</P>
<P>
   Third, Bush has produced some bold policies. He has had the
courage to touch the ``third rail'' of American politics, Social
Security reform. He has also had the ingenuity to raid Democratic
think-tanks for ideas. And he is finally giving his disparate ideas
some coherence.
</P>
<P>
   He stands for markets against government, he argues, for
innovation against stasis, for using the surplus to create new
social services rather than just to patch up old ones.
</P>
<P>
   Spin, of course; but pretty good spin.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, Bush is sailing against difficult winds. It is
exceedingly hard to unseat an incumbent in a time of peace and
unparalleled prosperity. It is particularly hard when the issues
favor the other side.
</P>
<P>
   In the 1980s, the Republicans won on issues like crime and the
Cold War; now they have to fight on health, education and Social
Security, where Democrats enjoy a double-digit lead in the polls.
</P>
<P>
   So why is Bush being treated as a laughingstock? The Republicans
are quick to blame the liberal bias of the media.
</P>
<P>
   More than 90 percent of journalists voted for Clinton-Gore in
1996, and most strongly disapprove of Bush's positions on abortion
and the death penalty.
</P>
<P>
   Mike Murphy, John McCain's adjutant during the primaries, points
out that the Gore team has been ``playing the media like a
violin.'' Every time Bush tries to talk about the issues, the press
corps interrupts him with loud questions about trivia instead.
</P>
<P>
   The obvious rejoinder to this is that until recently the press's
main target for abuse was Gore, for reinventing himself as an alpha
male and dubbing illegal fund-raising ``community outreach.''
</P>
<P>
   Most journalists were surprised by how well Gore's snog 'n'
speech at the Democratic Convention went down with the American
people.
</P>
<P>
   The American media's main fault is that of the playground bully:
whoever is losing gets the bulk of the derision.
</P>
<P>
   Republican charges of bias will have more sting if the press
fails now to chase Gore for fabricating a story about the relative
prices of medicines being consumed by his dog and his mother-in-law
(hardly Pulitzer stuff, but surely a more egregious sin than Bush's
over-covered one of making an obscene reference to a hostile
journalist.)
</P>
<P>
   None of this should be taken as an apologia pro Bush. There are
plenty of good reasons to reject him as president, but not many
being considered by the American press at the moment.
</P>
<P>
   At its heart, the election offers a choice between two
well-qualified, if not outstanding, candidates, and between two
contrasting philosophies, one rooted in the protective power of the
government, the other in the liberating effects of the market.
</P>
<P>
   A decent contest to get your teeth into. Unless of course you
are Bush, and you have to take your foot out of your mouth first. &QL;

VICE ADMIRAL TAKING COMMAND OF MEDITERRANEAN FLEET 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (a and i coding)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JOHN DONNELLY  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ He grew up on a farm of potato fields and henhouses
in the northern tip of Maine, walking a mile to and from a one-room
schoolhouse, which had seven students in grades one through six.
Three were members of his family.
</P>
<P>
   From those beginnings, Gregory G. Johnson rose through the ranks
of the Navy, to the highest levels of the Pentagon, to his new job
this week in which he will be eyeballing President Slobodan
Milosevic of Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
   Johnson, a three-star vice admiral, left his position this week
as senior military assistant to Defense Secretary William S. Cohen
to take command of the Sixth Fleet, where he will oversee 15,000
sailors and Marines and 30 warships.
</P>
<P>
   Instead of assuming formal command on Friday at the home port of
Gaeta, Italy, as planned, Johnson will immediately face a test. He
is to fly to his command ship, the USS LaSalle, which has been put
on alert in the Mediterranean to monitor the aftermath of Sunday's
chaotic voting in Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
   In case something goes very wrong following the elections, the
fleet _ soon to be Johnson's fleet _ will be poised to take a
variety of possible actions.
</P>
<P>
   He welcomes the challenge. He's happy just to be back at sea.
</P>
<P>
   Johnson, 54, has spent 16 years at sea, about half the duration
of his marriage. His naval background is as an aviator, part of a
community known for its swagger, but that is not Johnson. His
aviator-given nickname is Grog, a handle that conjures images of
late-night drinking, but that is not him either.
</P>
<P>
   To understand the new commander of the Sixth Fleet, a man of
moderation, is to throw out the stereotypes of military officers
and see him through the lens of growing up in Maine, specifically
Westmanland, Maine, population 40, of having roots in land
purchased by his Swedish great-grandfather in the late 19th
century.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am a fanatic. I'm a zealot when it comes to Maine,'' he said
one night recently in Washington after returning from his 50-acre
salt farm in Harpswell, Maine. ``And beware of zealots.''
</P>
<P>
   In his one-room schoolhouse, Johnson and his late brother,
Warren, only 10 1/2 months younger, were the janitors, each earning
30 cents a day to bring in a bucket of water for drinking and
``washing the chalkboard, putting a scoop of lime in the latrines,
carrying in the wood, and getting the fire going,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Such chores, he said, helped prepare him for the military.
</P>
<P>
   ``The wonderful thing about that community in Maine is several
circles of families embraced you, cared about you,'' he said. ``If
you did something that wasn't right, you not only let down your
immediate family, you let down your community family, let down your
church family, let down your 4-H family.''
</P>
<P>
   ``You had all these different communities _ just like the
military is an ever-increasing circle of families.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Maine shaped who he is,'' said his daughter Ashley, 24, who
lives in Boston's North End. ``It made up his character. The same
hard work that allowed his parents to persevere up there is the
same work ethic that allowed him to climb the ladder.''
</P>
<P>
   ``You get a sense,'' said his other daughter, Sydney, 28, who
lives in Washington, ``he knows what his place is. A lot of people
out there _ and he loves to say this _ are a lot smarter than he
is. He is humbled by his past, and he lives that way. I don't think
he ever dreamed he would be where he is today.''
</P>
<P>
   Johnson, slightly taller than 6 feet, his posture erect, his
stride that of a long-legged distance runner that he is, now faces
a job that calls for substantial military and diplomatic skills.
</P>
<P>
   In recent years, he has served as military assistant to the
former Joint Chiefs of Staff chairman Colin Powell, former deputy
defense secretary John Hamre, and, for the past 16 months, Cohen.
It has been a highly unusual career path, one viewed by outsiders
as being one plum job after the other but seen by some inside the
Navy as being away too long from operational command.
</P>
<P>
   Working for Cohen _ a Bangor native, although the two met in the
Pentagon _ has been a selfless job, reviewing every classified
document for him, acting as liaison between Cohen and the armed
services, and briefing him on matters ranging from deployment
orders to heated interagency battles.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have to act in a manner that leaves no footprints, no
fingerprints,'' he said. ``I have no agenda. I have the secretary's
agenda.''
</P>
<P>
   Now he must develop his own agenda. He faces multiple issues in
the Mediterranean, including Turkish-Greek relations, the future of
the disputed island of Cyprus, Israel's interaction with its Arab
neighbors, and the unpredictable Balkans _ starting on his first
day on the job.
</P>
<P>
   ``He'll be working 22-hour days and he's going to be on
professional pins and needles,'' said Hamre, now head of the Center
for Strategic and International Studies, a Washington think tank
that has long studied defense issues.
</P>
<P>
   First, though, when he lands on the USS LaSalle, carrying his
two nearly worn-out L.L. Bean tote bags, he must address those
under his command.
</P>
<P>
   Said Hamre: ``His big challenge is to convince people who don't
know him that he was the best commanding officer for the Sixth
Fleet, not that he was a political appointment. I think he'll take
care of that right away. If I could pick the perfect embodiment of
a military officer, I think it would be him.''
</P>
<P>
   But for the last year or so, even as he traveled around the
world with Cohen and worked long hours in the Pentagon, his life
wasn't all centered on military.
</P>
<P>
   For the first time in a decade, he and his wife, Joy, and their
two daughters lived in the same city.
</P>
<P>
   ``What's been great is the small things; it's Greg coming home
from work, the kids being here for dinner,'' said Joy Johnson.
</P>
<P>
   That time is over. The vice admiral and his wife leave Monday
for Italy.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's sadness, but we are ready to roll,'' said Joy Johnson.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had a wonderful year,'' said the vice admiral. ``But when
you grow up in a fairly cloistered corner of the world, you develop
a sense of adventure. It's something we didn't have. The Navy sort
of fills that itch. In Washington, you mature, you gather wisdom,
you learn diplomatic skills, but it's not like being out there.
That's where I want to be.''

   BLACKTOWN, Australia _ Laura Berg saw the ball sailing, and the
Japanese left fielder, Shiori Koseki, straining. Halfway down the
first-base line, Berg realized Koseki would be there, in position.
She watched the glove go up, and the catch being made. Suddenly,
Koseki was falling, the ball dislodging as Koseki landed on her
back.
</P>
<P>
   Suddenly, Jennifer McFalls was in full stride off second, and
Berg was watching the moment unfold, the gold medal moment. She
wanted to feel it, freeze it, because traumatic experience has
taught her that, ``You never know what comes from one moment to
another.''
</P>
<P>
   It was that way for the U.S. women's softball team here at the
Olympics, favored to defend its Atlanta gold medal, but having to
live on the edge, game to game, inning to inning. When the
Americans finally defeated Japan by 2-1 Tuesday night, they did it
with only one hit and the decisive play came in _ what else? _ an
extra inning, the eighth.
</P>
<P>
   It was another tense duel that featured Lisa Fernandez, the iron
lady of the U.S. pitching staff. After shutting out Australia in
the semifinal the previous night, after exorcising home run demons
named Peta Edebone and Joanne Brown on the final two outs,
Fernandez knew she would not be likely to have her best stuff. Her
coach, Ralph Raymond, still told her, ``It's yours to win or
lose.''
</P>
<P>
   ``And that's why Lisa Fernandez is who she is,'' Fernandez's
catcher, Stacey Nuveman, would say after Fernandez's three-hitter.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the Japanese, who finished undefeated in the preliminary
round, listed their employment in the tournament media guide as
``office clerk,'' and they played with a neat and orderly
efficiency. They didn't surprise Raymond, the native of Worcester,
Mass., who looks weathered enough to have managed the Red Sox.
</P>
<P>
   ``I said back in June Japan would be the sleeper,'' he said.
``They've been getting better and better.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Their starting pitcher, 20-year-old Mariko Masubuchi, didn't
throw as hard as Fernandez, but mixed up her pitches well. Her
fielders made the plays. And the Japanese coaches, who know
Fernandez well from the years she has played professionally in
Japan, may have been stealing the early innings signals from
Nuveman.
</P>
<P>
   The American side became suspicious when Reika Utsugi led off
the visitors' fourth inning by sitting on a Fernandez changeup and
clocking a rising liner to deep center field. Berg, one of the
team's shorter players at 5 feet 7 inches, went back to time her
leap. The ball sailed on past her, though, over the fence.
</P>
<P>
   ``I felt I should have had it, and that I owed Lisa one,'' she
said.
</P>
<P>
   After winning 112 straight games, the Americans suffered through
a numbing scoring drought against the three other teams that would
make the medal round. They dropped three straight last week for the
first time in 35 years of international play. They were demoralized
by the time Edebone's two-run homer cleared the left-field fence
and gave Australia a 2-1 victory over Fernandez after Australian
hitters had been struck out 25 times over 12 and two-thirds
innings.
</P>
<P>
   Berg was one of the vocal players who snapped them out of it. A
25-year-old assistant coach at Fresno State, she had played on the
1996 team, when winning and losing was life and death. A year ago,
in August, she found out differently. She was home in Fresno, and
had just been dropped off by her fiance, Eric Kidd, after they had
watched a movie.
</P>
<P>
   The dreaded phone call soon came. Kidd had gone to a friend's
birthday party. He got involved in some horseplay, stumbled, and
hit his head as he fell backward. He broke two vertebrae and was
paralyzed from the chest down.
</P>
<P>
   They have remained engaged, but only after Berg insisted.
</P>
<P>
   ``He thinks it's not fair for me to have to take care of him,''
she said. ``It's a natural feeling for him to have but it doesn't
matter. We have our good days and our bad days but I love him
unconditionally.''
</P>
<P>
   She awoke Tuesday, believing it would be one of the best days.
Back in Las Vegas, where Kidd lives, it was still Sept. 25, his
33rd birthday. They have not seen each other since Valentine's Day
because of Berg's Olympic commitments. They spoke by phone, and he
told her to bring home the gold.
</P>
<P>
   That plan looked endangered with the United States being no-hit
into the fifth inning Tuesday night. With one out, Michele Smith
was hit by a pitch and took second on a ground out. Up came
Nuveman, who had hit the ball cleanly into right field her first
time up, only to be thrown out at first. This time, she compensated
for her catcher's speed, lacing the ball into the right-center gap,
all the way to the fence. She lumbered no further than first but
the game was tied.
</P>
<P>
   By the home eighth, with Fernandez in a groove, the Japanese had
changed pitchers, bringing in Juri Takayama, who was unscored on in
the tournament. It was raining now, the ball was slick and the
grass was wet. Takayama walked Nuveman on a close 3-2 pitch. With
one out, she also walked Dot Richardson, sending McFalls, the
pinch-runner for Nuveman, to second.
</P>
<P>
   With the winning run in scoring position, the outfield had to
play shallow. A lefty contact hitter, Berg was told by Raymond to
go ahead, take her healthiest cut. She lofted the twisting fly that
would fall into and out of Koseki's glove. Koseki would tearfully
explain that she misjudged the ball. Officially, it was ruled an
error, but to Berg, and to her U.S. teammates, the scoring of the
play was lost in celebration, in the rain that washed away last
week's failure and put them on the gold medal stand again. &QL;

   HORSE CAVE AND PARK CITY, KY. _ More than 100 years ago, the
small town of Horse Cave became the second city in Kentucky to be
wired for electricity. It did this by harnessing the swooshing
waters of the Hidden River, an underground stream that briefly
opens to the sky in the center of town.
</P>
<P>
   After this great feat, Hidden River cave remained unused for
most of the 20th century _ except as a particularly nauseating open
sewer. Now, once again, it is the center of town.
</P>
<P>
   Fifteen years ago, a small Virginia-based group, the American
Cave Conservation Association, came to town and started a
reclamation project. A new sewer was built.
</P>
<P>
   The town center now features a popular theatre, a folksy
bookshop-restaurant, an environmental museum devoted to caves _ and
the cave itself, now reached by a swooping staircase. Last year,
some 17,000 visitors trekked down into its cool, misty innards.
</P>
<P>
   Caves are once again becoming big business in central Kentucky.
</P>
<P>
   In the 1920s and 1930s, this part of the state was riven by a
``cave war'' _ a bitter and sometimes unscrupulous competition for
the dollars of passing motorists. Then, in 1941, the federal
government opened the Mammoth Cave National Park. It proved an
immediate hit: even today, it attracts 1.8 million visitors a year
and people are required to reserve a spot in advance.
</P>
<P>
   The fiercely independent cave-owners blame Mammoth for many of
their problems. Bill Austin, a fourth-generation cave-owner, still
rails at the National Park Service for forcing him to sell off a
portion of his cave land in 1961. He also complains with some
justification that the park charges far too little.
</P>
<P>
   Still, many of his industry's woes have stemmed from other
things _ the blossoming of amusement parks, the advent of cheap air
travel, and the arrival of Interstate 65, which sped drivers from
Nashville to Louisville in air-conditioned cars, rather than
encouraging them to stop for a breather at a cave.
</P>
<P>
   Now, however, the caves have discovered a new lease of life _ as
environmental edutainment.
</P>
<P>
   Gone are the tacky colored-light shows. Instead, the caves have
begun to sell themselves as places where a family can learn
together about geology and conservation.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not some cold fact in a science book,'' boasts Gary
Berdeaux, who recently bought and spruced up Diamond Caverns in
Park City. ``Things come alive.''
</P>
<P>
   When he was in his 20s, Berdeaux successfully revived the
abandoned Endless Caverns in Virginia, both by opening them to
tourists and bottling their water for sale.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, he teamed up with four other cave-loving professional
couples to purchase Diamond Caverns from a big resort company. In
the past year, he has doubled traffic at Diamond Caverns and is
gunning for more.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike Austin, Berdeaux maintains cordial relations with his
neighbor, the National Park Service (from whom he snares a sizeable
number of overflow visitors).
</P>
<P>
   Whereas the prior generation of cave-owners consisted of
``promoters,'' Berdeaux likes to talk about things like
``stewardship.'' This approach has won backing from the American
Cave Conservation Association.
</P>
<P>
   ``Unfortunately, some people think that if you make a dollar off
the environment, it's a dirty dollar,'' argues its president, Dave
Foster. ``I think you can make that dollar and at the same time be
a preservationist.'' Just so long as there are no more smelly
sewers. &QL;

MEN'S STYLES TAKE CUES FROM '80S LADIES LOOK 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By TINA CASSIDY  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Men aren't the only ones confused about what they
should be wearing. Fashion designers seem mixed up as well, showing
off spring collections last week that ranged from grass-stained
jeans (intentional) to cropped pants and shorts with suit jackets.
</P>
<P>
   For guys.
</P>
<P>
   However, there was a unifying theme to the otherwise disparate
designs: An overtly casual overlay, with neckties being one of the
few noticeably absent accessories during several days of heavily
accessorized productions.
</P>
<P>
   Instead of reinterpreting, say, khakis, designers seemed to be
scanning their sketch pads of women's clothes for inspiration from
the punk and disco eras, as well as more recent trends.
</P>
<P>
   One of the only complete men's suit ensembles came from Cynthia
Rowley, whose model, in a trim black jacket and pants, white dress
shirt, thin tie, and narrow-toed shoes, could have stepped off a
Joe Jackson album cover from the early '80s.
</P>
<P>
   The narrow tie, while very new wave, also could have been a wink
to neckwear's shrinking importance in these days of business casual
dressing.
</P>
<P>
   Rowley also thought up the idea of jeans with grass stains or
flowers or bumbles bees stitched on them, often paired with campy
T-shirts with images of cats.
</P>
<P>
   Just as leather will be strong for women throughout the year,
designers relied heavily on the material for men.
</P>
<P>
   Helmut Lang's collection, revealed in a stark white Chelsea
studio, was wrapped up in bondage references. Lang seemed to be
playing with the ideas of skin on skin and flesh tones by dressing
a model in leather boxer shorts that poked out of his
salmon-colored suit pants worn with nude-colored leather shoes.
</P>
<P>
   With his signature minimalistic style, the Viennese-bred
designer found a way to dress down suit jackets by mixing them with
unmatched pants and finely woven T-shirtlike tops.
</P>
<P>
   Likewise, Anna Sui's collection also incorporated leather and
relaxed looks for men. She showed a white leather coat over a black
stretch jersey tank with black leather pants. And she paired a
T-shirt with a white silk tuxedo jacket and black silk tuxedo
pants, as if to pronounce that no occasion is too dressy these days
to leave a tie behind.
</P>
<P>
   Michael Kors, whose show was heavy with earth tones (organically
named barley, sienna, heather, pueblo, and cornflower), displayed
ribbed muscle shirts under suit jackets and drawstring pajama pants
in suede, muslin, or striped cotton. A signature combination
comprised a canvas-backed suede jacket, a cashmere pullover, and
cotton twill shorts. Everything looked soft and comfortable.
</P>
<P>
   Kors, whose theme song ``Ride Like the Wind'' set the
driving-through-the-desert tone for his show, also used wide
leather belts on some of the men, but as more of a hippy reference
than an '80s one prominent among women's fashions throughout the
7th on 6th shows.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A change for capri pants
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Two years ago, capri pants became the item that propelled
ladies' warm weather fashions. But last spring, there was no such
fad, and retailers are still smarting from the season's clothing
bust.
</P>
<P>
   However, one designer decided to see if men would go for cropped
pants, too. Joop! (pronounced yope) showed off midcalf length white
cotton trousers, or slim striped ones with a floral design shirt.
One Joop! model also wore tight, hip-hugging swim trunks that
looked very old-fashioned.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Taking it to the streets
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A typical post-Fashion Week observer asks: Who wears this stuff?
The typical answer would be: Movie stars, especially those
populating the front rows of the shows; club kids; and those whose
jobs don't involve banks and courtrooms.
</P>
<P>
   However, better questions might be: How will these fashions
translate on the street? What themes will be drawn from the
collections and reinterpreted? In other words, what knock-off looks
will Banana Republic or Urban Outfitters stock?
</P>
<P>
   The likely answer is that guys will see their pant legs narrow,
just like jacket lapels and ties, which are as much of a bellwether
for menswear as skirt lengths are for women.
</P>
<P>
   Department stores likely will be selling lots of jackets and
pants in suede and leather. And denim jackets and jeans _ often
with a twist _ will be wardrobe staples.

LINDLAND, LEGAL VICTOR, FINISHES SECOND ON THE MAT 
</HEADLINE>
   By RICHARD SANDOMIR    
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   SYDNEY, Australia _ Matt Lindland's circuitous route to the
Olympic wrestling mat took him from the trials to the rulings of
arbitrators and into federal courtrooms. Back and forth the tussle
went over whether he or Matt Sieracki would be placed on the U.S.
Greco-Roman team. One day, Sieracki was the 167{-pound
representative. The next, it was Lindland.
</P>
<P>
   Eventually, the balding and goateed Lindland was the one to come
to Sydney, and Sieracki stayed home in Colorado. As if to justify
the wisdom of the federal judges who backed him, Lindland rolled
through his class, defeating Georgian, Algerian and Ukrainian
opponents to reach Tuesday night's gold medal match against Mourat
Kardanov of Russia.
</P>
<P>
   But Lindland's best maneuvers seemed to be left for his legal
fight and his 76-kilogram bouts before he met Kardanov, who won the
gold with a 3-0 shutout. In the bronze medal match, Marko
Yli-Hannuksela of Finland beat David Manukyan of Ukraine.
</P>
<P>
   Garrett Lowney of the United States took a surprise bronze medal
in the 97-kilogram (214-pound) class, defeating Thanos Konstantinos
of Greece, 3-1. Sweden's Mikael Ljungberg, a two-time world
champion who beat Lowney in the semifinals, won by 2-1 over David
Saldadze of Ukraine for the gold.
</P>
<P>
   ``We knew we had a lot of talent and a lot of good shots at
medaling,'' Lowney said. ``The people who didn't think we had a
chance just weren't following Greco-Roman.''
</P>
<P>
   Kardanov dominated Lindland early, scoring a 1- point takedown
and a 2-point gut wrench in the first period. Then Kardanov totally
contained Lindland, frustrating him into inertia. They grasped at
each other's heads and shoulders, but Lindland rarely put himself
in scoring position.
</P>
<P>
   Late in the second period, Lindland was poised to turn Kardanov
but failed to score.
</P>
<P>
   ``The key was who got on top early and got their turns when we
were dry,'' Lindland said afterward. ``The second period got
slippery'' with perspiration.
</P>
<P>
   He added: ``He didn't want me to turn him. He was defending, and
it was wet out there.''
</P>
<P>
   Through an interpreter, Kardanov said: ``I was told he would be
tough to the last second and I based my defense on that. My main
task was to win this with my technique.''
</P>
<P>
   In Greco-Roman, no holds can be made below the hips, and the use
of legs is prohibited except for support.
</P>
<P>
   Lindland's resemblance to the actor John Malkovich is uncanny,
as is his brooding demeanor and unshakable confidence in his
talent. ``I got here because I'm a better wrestler than Keith is,''
he said, his silver medal dangling from his neck.
</P>
<P>
   At no time in his legal quest to make the Olympic team, he said,
did he expect to lose. ``It was well worth it because I was always
planning to wrestle in this tournament,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Lindland lost to Sieracki, 2-1, in the Olympic trials in June,
but protested that Sieracki had illegally tripped him. The United
States wrestling federation twice rejected his appeal, but an
arbitrator ordered a rematch, which Lindland won, 8-0. Sieracki
appealed to a second arbitrator, contending that he was not invited
to the first arbitration; this time, Sieracki's original victory
was upheld.
</P>
<P>
   But the 7th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals eventually forced the
U.S. Olympic Committee, which was backing Sieracki, to name
Lindland to the team.
</P>
<P>
   ``If all that put pressure on me, hopefully it helped my
performance,'' Lindland said. ``If there isn't enough pressure, it
doesn't seem important.'' Regarding his relationship with the
Olympic committee, he added, ``I'm sorry I had to get on the team
this way, but I think the best guy got on the team.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Another U.S. wrestler, Rulon Gardner, is still alive in the
130-kilogram (286-pound) superheavyweight division. But the
unquestioned favorite on Wednesday is Aleksandr Karelin, the
three-time Olympic champion and member of the Russian Parliament,
who has never lost in international competition.
</P>
<P>
   Also in contention for a medal on Wednesday is Jim Gruenwald of
the United States in the 58-kilogram (127{-pound) class.
</P>
<P>
   The medal ceremony for the 54-kilogram (119-pound) class saw the
gold medalist, Sim Kwon Ho of South Korea, stand beside the bronze
medalist, Kang Yong Gyun of North Korea. The two nations,
technically at war, are joined as one team in the Olympics, and
marched together in the opening ceremony.
</P>
<P>
   A modest cheering section of Koreans cheered for both wrestlers.
Sim said he got tips from the North Korean wrestlers about Lazaro
Rivas, of Cuba, in their gold medal match.
</P>
<P>
   ``They told me the Cuban is pretty good and to be careful,'' he
said through an interpreter. ``When athletes play and practice
together, this is expected.''

BETHEL HAS SERENITY, CHARM AND SPECTACULAR FOLIAGE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By WILLIAM A. DAVIS

<TEXT>
<P>
   BETHEL, Maine _ There are already touches of color in the
countryside in this inland corner of Maine, just to the east of the
foothills of the White Mountains.
</P>
<P>
   The rows of sugar maples lining the village common are about to
turn scarlet and will stay that way deep into fall. The common,
with its classic white bandstand, will be abuzz with activity this
weekend as the focal point of the Bethel Harvest Fest.
</P>
<P>
   The annual festival kicks off the fall foliage season in a part
of New England where peak foliage comes a bit earlier than most
places and arrives with a brilliance that rivals anything to be
seen in the Berkshires, Vermont, or just over the mountains in New
Hampshire. The White Mountains are entirely in the Granite State,
of course, but the White Mountain National Forest straddles state
boundaries and extends deep into western Maine.
</P>
<P>
   This weekend's festival on the common boasts a crafts fair,
logging competitions and demonstrations, chain saw sculpture, a
farmers' market, and even a chowder judging competition. The
gateways of the old houses around the common, and elsewhere in
town, are decorated with scarecrows, imaginative specters that in
the best upcountry Yankee tradition make creative use of such
seasonal materials as fallen leaves, corn husks, and pumpkins.
</P>
<P>
   A town of 2,500, Bethel is a four-season resort that is busiest
in winter when the two local ski areas, Sunday River (Maine's
largest) and Mount Abram, are in full operation. Though winter is
the livelier time, many Bethelites much prefer autumn. ``This is
the best time of year,'' declares Melody Bonnema. ``The hiking is
fantastic, the colors are beautiful, and you aren't overwhelmed
with people.'' A potter whose kiln and showroom, Bonnema Potters
(207-824-2821), are on lower Main Street, Bonnema calls fall her
season of inspiration.
</P>
<P>
   ``I like to go into the National Forest,'' she says, ``making
sketches and noticing the colors.'' The scenes and autumnal
shadings she sees and records on these trips eventually decorate
the colorful tiles, porcelain, and stoneware she displays and sells
in her shop.
</P>
<P>
   Other Main Street stores also carry distinctly local crafts. For
instance, Maine Line Products (207-824-2522) specializes in such
made-in-Maine gift items as wooden birdhouses, Maine woodsmen's
weather sticks (they droop when it's going to rain), and stuffed
moose toys.
</P>
<P>
   Definitely in the category of gifts for people who have
everything, however, are Maine Line's earrings and pendants made
from moose droppings. Gathered in midwinter, when moose chew bark
and twigs for sustenance, these polished droppings are said to be
99 percent wood. ``They look all right,'' notes one shopper, ``but
that 1 percent bothers me.''
</P>
<P>
   At Mount Mann Jewelers (207-824-3030), also on Main Street, Jim
Mann crafts jewelry, mostly using local stones, some of which he
mines himself.
</P>
<P>
   This part of Maine is surprisingly rich in semiprecious gem
stones, including tourmaline, amethyst, morganite, and aquamarine.
The region is home to both commercial mines and public areas where
amateur rock hunters are free to try their luck. The Crystal Cave,
in the basement of Mann's shop, is a dimly lit replica of a gem
mine where children can browse through bins of rocks and stones,
learning about geology and gemology the hands-on way.
</P>
<P>
   Although trekkers visit all summer, autumn is the height of the
local hiking season. ``This is when I do my hiking,'' says National
Forest ranger Mary Jo Kelly. ``It's cool now so you don't get all
sweaty when you climb and there aren't any bugs, which is nice.
</P>
<P>
   The most popular hikes are in the National Forest, which begins
about 5 miles from Bethel Village. The views from Evans Notch are
spectacular, and trails in Grafton Notch State Park lead to such
renowned scenic spots as Step Falls and Screw Auger Falls. Trail
maps and hiking information are available at the National Forest
ranger station on Route 2 in Bethel.
</P>
<P>
   One unusual hiking option is llama trekking. You do the
trekking, and llamas, the traditional beast of burden of the Andes,
carry backpacks and supplies. Llama treks of varying lengths are
offered by Telemark Inn (207-836-2703, www.telemarkinn.com), a
rustic lodge and former private sporting camp surrounded by the
National Forest.
</P>
<P>
   An even easier way to reach a great view, including a glimpse of
the Presidential Range of the White Mountains, is to take the
Sunday River Ski Area chairlift to the top. Open year-round, Sunday
River (800-543-2754, www.sundayriver.com) has a mountain bike park
(rental bikes are available) and hosts special events such as a
crafts fair and fall festival Oct. 7-9.
</P>
<P>
   Canoeing and kayaking on the Androscoggin River, which flows
through Bethel, is another popular outdoor activity. Once badly
polluted by industrial waste from upriver paper mills, the river
has been cleaned up in the past decade and is once more a
recreational asset.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Androscoggin is a gorgeous river to paddle on now and one
of Maine's environmental success stories,'' says Jeff Parsons, who
operates the riverside Bethel Outdoor Adventure and Campground
(800-533-3607/207-824-4224, www.betheloutdooradventure.com) on
Mayville Road (Route 2). The outfit rents canoes, kayaks, and
bicycles.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, a century ago the area's many opportunities for healthy
outdoor exercise helped transform Bethel from a sleepy lumber and
farming town into a resort community that attracted wealthy
health-seeking ``rusticators'' from around the country.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. John Gehring, a Cleveland physician, came here to recuperate
after he suffered a physical and mental breakdown. He credited
Bethel's serenity, natural beauty, and outdoor lifestyle with his
rapid and full recovery.
</P>
<P>
   In 1895, he founded a pricey but innovative institute for
``nervous disorders'' that offered lots of fresh air, hard physical
activity, and good food (formal eight-course dinners were served
nightly). Grateful patients showered philanthropy on Bethel,
helping to found, among many other things, the Bethel Inn, which
opened its doors in 1913. Its golf course is located on land
cleared of trees by Gehring's patients, who paid handsomely for the
opportunity.
</P>
<P>
   Rambling along one side of the common, the 98-room Bethel Inn
(800-654-0125, www.bethelinn.com) was long the town's social center
and remains the grande dame of local hostelries. However, there are
many other good places to stay in the area.
</P>
<P>
   Centrally located inns and B&AMP;Bs of note include the Victoria Inn
(888-774-1235, www.thevictoria-inn.com) on Main Street, a small inn
with high Victorian decor and a popular restaurant. Chapman Inn
(877-359-1498, www.chapmaninn.com) is a comfortable 10-room inn on
Broad Street. The very pleasant 16-room Sudbury Inn on Main Street
has a restaurant many consider the area's finest and a basement tap
room, the Suds Pub, known for its pizza and 26 beers on tap.

<P>
   (UNDATED) _ A military adage holds that a man under fire will
show the best or the worst side of his character. Judged by that
standard, Vojislav Kostunica, the stolid law professor who is
leading the opinion polls in Yugoslavia's presidential race, comes
out rather well.
</P>
<P>
   In Mitrovica, the Serb stronghold in Kosovo, his appearance at
the hustings drew a hail of rotten tomatoes, potatoes and other
smelly vegetables. It was a well-organized provocation by
supporters of Slobodan Milosevic, the Serbian strongman whose
bloody, 11-year reign he is trying to end.
</P>
<P>
   But Kostunica, sensing that his mettle was being tested, still
managed to get through most of his speech. Realizing that
association with the western forces that bombed his country last
year could be a kiss of death, he refrained from asking French
soldiers standing nearby to protect him; only when a stone hit his
face did his bodyguards pull him aside.
</P>
<P>
   Serbia's unlikely champion of democracy, until recently a worthy
but obscure member of Belgrade's hard-pressed opposition, has
proved equally stoical in the face of a different sort of flak:
vitriolic personal attacks by the pro-Milosevic press.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everything about Vojislav Kostunica is a lie,'' said one
paper, Politika, which called him a dull, narrow-minded pedant who
had falsified his family history and was so stiff he could be
wearing a bulletproof vest.
</P>
<P>
   Despite these impediments, he was alleged to philander
compulsively with women under 25, and to share his house with 17
cats. About the dullness, the mudslingers may have a point; but
many Serbian voters feel they have had an overdose of charisma.
</P>
<P>
   In any case almost everyone, including Kostunica, agrees that he
will have to endure even heavier fire _ including, perhaps, the
literal kind _ before he has any hope of unseating the Yugoslav
president.
</P>
<P>
   The Milosevic machine, a network of loyal security chiefs,
sanctions-busting criminals and political apparatchiks, is unlikely
to yield power gracefully.
</P>
<P>
   ``Faced with the choice between holding on to power and a
war-crimes trial in The Hague, Milosevic will opt for the former,''
says Filip Vujanovic, prime minister of Montenegro, Serbia's
semi-detached partner in the Yugoslav federation.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, Kostunica has questioned the legitimacy of the tribunal
at The Hague, refusing to give any promise that on becoming
president he would deliver his opponent into its tender care.
</P>
<P>
   But given the murky political traditions of Serbia, where power
has never changed hands by democratic means, a defeated Milosevic
could face an even worse fate at the hands of his fellow Serbs.
</P>
<P>
   If the poll were fair, opinion surveys suggest that Kostunica
would win at least a third of the vote in the first round on Sept.
24, while the president could hope for no more than a quarter.
</P>
<P>
   Vojislav Mihailovic, a second opposition candidate, may garner
up to 10 percent in round one but will urge his supporters to back
Kostunica in round two, scheduled for Oct. 8. But nobody expects it
will be that simple; the runoff may never happen.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, the best guess is that within a couple of hours of the
polling stations closing, Milosevic will claim victory, however
people vote.
</P>
<P>
   Kostunica and the coalition of 18 parties which back him will
probably do the same. Then predictions become even shakier.
</P>
<P>
   The final outcome might be determined by street demonstrations,
the loyalty of the security forces, or by the calculations of
Milosevic's ruthless inner circle.
</P>
<P>
   A week before the election, General Nebojsa Pavkovic, the head
of a Yugoslav army whose senior ranks have been thoroughly purged
by Milosevic, gave an ominous pledge that his troops would prevent
any move by the opposition to ``take power in the street.''
</P>
<P>
   But would they? While Serbia's well-armed police have always
been a pliant instrument of the regime, the loyalties of the middle
and lower ranks of the army are uncertain.
</P>
<P>
   In any showdown, Kostunica may have some appeal to Yugoslavia's
battered servicemen. In campaign speeches, he has insisted that the
army fought honorably in Kosovo last year and stridently denounced
NATO's air war.
</P>
<P>
   His complaint against Milosevic is that he provoked the western
alliance to intervene and then abandoned the Serbs in Kosovo to
revenge attacks by the province's Albanian majority.
</P>
<P>
   This, as Kostunica and others have observed, was a repetition of
the Serb bully's behavior during the Croatian and Bosnian wars:
first, provoke unspeakable ethnic violence, then leave the ethnic
Serbs to their fate. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; (200-WORD OPTIONAL TRIM BEGINS HERE AT 750) &LR;  &QC;
</P>
<P>
   Kostunica, too, can claim to have behaved consistently over the
years _ in a better sense. At the age of 30, in 1974, he lost his
job as a law lecturer because he opposed political changes designed
to decentralize communist Yugoslavia and to devolve power to the
republics and provinces.
</P>
<P>
   A decade later, with Yugoslavia still under Marxist control, he
stuck his neck out by demanding a multi-party system. Then, in
1989, he helped create such a system, by co-founding the small
Democratic Party.
</P>
<P>
   During the war in Bosnia, he supported the cause of the Serbs in
that republic but kept his distance from their leader, another
war-crimes suspect, Radovan Karadzic.
</P>
<P>
   He fell out on various matters of principle with Zoran Djindjic
and Vuk Draskovic, Serbia's more prominent opposition leaders.
</P>
<P>
   But even in the Serb-nationalist strongholds of Montenegro,
where Milosevic got a rave reception this week, Kostunica is
respected for being straight.
</P>
<P>
   These days, it is much to his advantage that he is not
identified with Milosevic's better-known foes at home. These have
become easy meat for Serbian government propagandists by hobnobbing
with the likes of Madeleine Albright, America's secretary of state,
seen as an architect of last year's air attacks on Serbia. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; (END OF OPTIONAL TRIM. STORY CONTINUES TO 1,050) &LR;  &QC;
</P>
<P>
   But given that Kostunica is so stern a critic of NATO policy,
why are western governments putting so much faith in him?
</P>
<P>
   The answer is that, though they know he would fight the Serb
corner in a tough and consistent way, he would abide by his
commitment to democracy and law _ and eschew Milosevic's tactics of
stirring up ethnic hatred and terror.
</P>
<P>
   That alone would be a huge improvement. &QL;

<P>
   (UNDATED) _ A military adage holds that a man under fire will
show the best or the worst side of his character. Judged by that
standard, Vojislav Kostunica, the stolid law professor who is
leading the opinion polls in Yugoslavia's presidential race, comes
out rather well.
</P>
<P>
   In Mitrovica, the Serb stronghold in Kosovo, his appearance at
the hustings drew a hail of rotten tomatoes, potatoes and other
smelly vegetables. It was a well-organized provocation by
supporters of Slobodan Milosevic, the Serbian strongman whose
bloody, 11-year reign he is trying to end.
</P>
<P>
   But Kostunica, sensing that his mettle was being tested, still
managed to get through most of his speech. Realizing that
association with the western forces that bombed his country last
year could be a kiss of death, he refrained from asking French
soldiers standing nearby to protect him; only when a stone hit his
face did his bodyguards pull him aside.
</P>
<P>
   Serbia's unlikely champion of democracy, until recently a worthy
but obscure member of Belgrade's hard-pressed opposition, has
proved equally stoical in the face of a different sort of flak:
vitriolic personal attacks by the pro-Milosevic press.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everything about Vojislav Kostunica is a lie,'' said one
paper, Politika, which called him a dull, narrow-minded pedant who
had falsified his family history and was so stiff he could be
wearing a bulletproof vest.
</P>
<P>
   Despite these impediments, he was alleged to philander
compulsively with women under 25, and to share his house with 17
cats. About the dullness, the mudslingers may have a point; but
many Serbian voters feel they have had an overdose of charisma.
</P>
<P>
   In any case almost everyone, including Kostunica, agrees that he
will have to endure even heavier fire _ including, perhaps, the
literal kind _ before he has any hope of unseating the Yugoslav
president.

   CAMBRIDGE, Mass. _ It doesn't take a philosopher to understand
how boredom corrodes the soul.
</P>
<P>
   Whatever you call it _ angst, ennui, or weltshmerz _ the mix of
solitude and emptiness is a gnawing disease for a gregarious
species such as human beings.
</P>
<P>
   Although such self-conscious despair has been held up by the
likes of Descartes as a uniquely human distinction, other creatures
experience the cerebral malady, especially domesticated animals,
researchers at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology say.
</P>
<P>
   The problem for pets, like toddlers in constant need of a
diversion, is that they can't just flip on the television, pick up
a newspaper, or make a call to banish their boredom. When their
masters leave, often locking pets in cages or small rooms for most
of the day, the researchers say the animals suffer a privation
similar to prisoners in solitary confinement.
</P>
<P>
   Now, in a bid to blunt the tedium and loneliness they believe
afflicts many of the 125 million domestic dogs, cats, and birds
throughout the country, MIT researchers are turning to the latest
cure-for-all-ills _ the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   ``Many animals have a lot more intelligence than they're given
credit for,'' said Irene Pepperberg, a visiting professor at MIT
who is leading the research. ``What we're trying to do (in the case
of pets) is to use our knowledge of their intelligence to challenge
them, enhance their environments, and reduce their deprivation when
they're alone.''
</P>
<P>
   Pepperberg, one the nation's leading authorities on animal
intelligence, believes most animals are unfairly denigrated as
``creatures of instinct'' rather than ``sentient beings.''
</P>
<P>
   For the last 23 years, she has studied the cognitive abilities
of grey parrots, proving that with proper training they can
identify scores of different objects, recognize quantities,
distinguish colors and shapes, and understand the concepts of
``bigger,'' ``smaller,'' ``same,'' and ``different.''
</P>
<P>
   The professor believes her work shows animals don't merely
respond to stimulus, as behaviorists argue, but actually think. For
Pepperberg, years of testing her 23-year-old parrot, Alex, confirm
that birds with a walnut-size brain can do more than mimic or learn
rote behavior; she said her parrots reason, comprehend, and
calculate at the level of a 4-year-old child.
</P>
<P>
   They're also temperamental like young children, especially in
isolation. When Pepperberg leaves her parrots alone for too long,
as happens when she locks them in cages at MIT for the night, they
become withdrawn, pluck out their feathers, scream, and become
recalcitrant and disobedient.
</P>
<P>
   After so many years studying parrots, she's now setting out to
achieve a lifelong goal, one she has had since her father brought
home her first parakeet when she was a child growing up in New York
City. It's among the main reasons why Pepperberg has spent most of
her life studying animals: She wants to improve their lives.
</P>
<P>
   Since moving to MIT last year from the University of Arizona,
she has been soliciting ideas. In an ad posted on the Internet, she
asks students: ``Toys for children are now often computer-driven
and interactive; might the same advances be applicable to toys for
pets? . . . Can you devise something more interesting than a chew
toy for Rover, a catnip mouse for Fluffy, or a mirrored bell for
Polly?''
</P>
<P>
   They have, or at least they're trying.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps the most intriguing pet diversion is called InterPet
Explorer. The idea is to build a bird-friendly Web browser that
enables parrots to use the Internet to play games, look and squawk
at pictures of parrots and other images, listen to music, interact
with their owners, and, perhaps, socialize with other parrots in
chat rooms.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're still at the very early stages,'' said Benjamin Resner,
a children's software developer and one of Pepperberg's research
assistants, who came up with the idea. ``The hope is that, if this
works, it's something that will be applicable for other animals and
enrich the lives of America's pets.''
</P>
<P>
   So far, however, the project has been slow to advance. The prime
research subject, Arthur _ a 2-year-old parrot who is also called
``Wart'' after Merlin the magician's nickname for King Arthur in
the book, ``The Once and Future King'' _ still pecks at virtual
images of other parrots without understanding the experiment.
</P>
<P>
   The design of InterPet Explorer is evolving. Over the past few
months, it has consisted of a joystick that Wart can move in
various directions, and a tough Lucite box with clickable levers.
The goal is for the bird to manipulate the joystick with his beak,
choosing from various musical selections and images displayed on a
nearby monitor. Parrots require a liquid crystal display screen
because the flickering of conventional television screens and
computer monitors make it difficult for them to see images clearly.
</P>
<P>
   The researchers are also experimenting with how to train Wart.
They don't force him to use the browser, and the parrot doesn't
earn rewards for choosing a particular course of action. ``His
motivation for using the setup are the intrinsic rewards of
interaction, problem solving, entertainment, and diversion _ much
the same as for human computer users,'' according to the project's
promotional literature.
</P>
<P>
   ``The initial goal is not only to allow him to pick his screen
wallpaper or choose tunes from a jukebox, but also to teach him to
use the controller to change his environment,'' the prospectus
explains. ``Once he learns how this Lucite box controls his
environment, he has learned to interface with any software we
develop.''
</P>
<P>
   The problem of getting Wart on the Internet, however, has proven
more difficult than previously thought. It's not just a matter of
teaching him to use a modified mouse; it's getting the bird
interested in the content.
</P>
<P>
   In recent tests, images displayed on the LCD screen have had
little to no effect. Pictures of Pepperberg meant to please Wart
have not provoked a significantly different response than pictures
of an owl, a natural enemy.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're still in the stage of figuring out what they like to
manipulate,'' said Bruce M. Blumberg, an assistant professor at MIT
who is helping Pepperberg supervise the research. ``Do they want
video screens, or would they prefer more of a tactile surface to
interface with? We're studying their play patterns, as anyone would
do designing toys for kids.''
</P>
<P>
   No matter how eerily human grey parrots sound when they speak,
some scientists reject the premise that animals can think _ or
experience conscious feelings like boredom. Yet Pepperberg and her
fellow researchers say they have only received encouragement for
the project.
</P>
<P>
   ``What we hear is more that we should push ahead,'' Pepperberg
said.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, the raven-haired professor, 51, completed the bulk of
her life's work _ a book published by Harvard University Press
containing more than two decades worth of data detailing her parrot
Alex's cognitive feats.
</P>
<P>
   The research compiled in ``The Alex Studies'' doesn't just point
out the intelligence of grey parrots, Pepperberg said; it serves to
suggest how little we understand about animal cognition and how
much more there is to learn.
</P>
<P>
   For most of her career, Pepperberg has sought something akin to
King Solomon's ring, which, according to legend, allowed him to
communicate with all the animals in his kingdom. With the training
methods she has honed over 23 years, teaching Alex to distinguish
everything from colors to objects, she believes she has found at
least an approximation to the fabled ring.
</P>
<P>
   Now, she's looking to put the research to use. She recently flew
Alex and her other bird, Griffin, from Tucson to MIT to join Wart
in the research.
</P>
<P>
   A demonstration of parrot intelligence early this month by Alex,
however, reflects the difficulties that lay ahead for InterPet
Explorer and any other interactive device MIT researchers design in
hopes of easing pets' boredom.
</P>
<P>
   Holding Alex on her hand and pointing to a jumble of blocks,
Pepperberg asked him, ``How many green blocks?''
</P>
<P>
   ``Two,'' the parrot answered incorrectly.
</P>
<P>
   ``No,'' Pepperberg said testily and prodded him again with same
question.
</P>
<P>
   This time, no answer.
</P>
<P>
   ``C'mon Alex, you're playing games,'' she complained. ``Wake up!
You're not being very cooperative.''
</P>
<P>
   After a few seconds of silence, the bedraggled bird, eyed the
blocks and reconsidered his previous response. ``Four,'' he
answered correctly.
</P>
<P>
   Then, repeating a phrase well known to the less schooled of his
species, the parrot demanded: ``Want a nut.''

   PRISTINA, KOSOVO _ Which place will become a decent democracy
first _ Kosovo or Serbia proper?
</P>
<P>
   The answer will greatly affect the outcome of the unresolved
battle between the Serbs, who hope the breakaway province will
remain within their orbit, at least notionally, and Kosovo's
ethnic-Albanian leaders, who demand independence.
</P>
<P>
   If Kosovo looks incapable of becoming a decent, law-governed
state, even under western tutelage, its leaders' case for a final
break with the Yugoslav federation will weaken _ especially if
Serbia itself becomes more democratic after this weekend's
presidential and parliamentary poll in Serbia and, more
contentiously, in Montenegro.
</P>
<P>
   That may be one reason why Yugoslavia's masters have in recent
weeks been trying harder than usual to destabilize Kosovo, and make
life difficult for its international administrators, who are
preparing to hold local elections _ arguably the first above-board
test of Kosovar opinion ever conducted _ in late October.
</P>
<P>
   So far, things have been going quite well for Yugoslavia's
sitting president, Slobodan Milosevic, and other would-be wreckers.
</P>
<P>
   The foreigners running the province of Kosovo _ the United
Nations, NATO and the Organization for Security and Cooperation in
Europe _ have been struggling against mounting odds to maintain a
minimum of stability and open political debate.
</P>
<P>
   Early this month, Milosevic cunningly sent a delegation from his
Socialist party to the southern province, to urge the 100,000 or so
ethnic Serbs still living there to vote in the Yugoslav elections.
</P>
<P>
   That put Bernard Kouchner, the Frenchman who runs Kosovo for the
United Nations, on the spot. Should he allow the Serbs to cast
votes in what is still, under the terms of U.N. resolutions, their
own country?
</P>
<P>
   Or should he risk seeming weak or unfair by insisting that,
because of security problems, no residents of Kosovo could take
part in Yugoslav ballot?
</P>
<P>
   In the end, he came up with a fudge. While denouncing the
Belgrade-run contest as hopelessly flawed, he agreed that local
Serbs could take part _ and promised that NATO would do its best to
let them do so in secure conditions.
</P>
<P>
   But neither NATO nor the pro-Milosevic camp is saying anything
in advance about how exactly they expect voting to be conducted in
Kosovo's highly abnormal conditions.
</P>
<P>
   If Serbs are attacked by Albanians on the way to vote, that will
be a blow to the credibility of NATO _ as the supposed guarantor of
safety for all Kosovo's residents _ and a boost, paradoxically, for
Serb nationalist propaganda.
</P>
<P>
   With tension rising steadily, NATO troops this week raided a
Serb enclave and arrested some former and serving members of the
Yugoslav army who had infiltrated from Serbia on a mission to blow
up targets in Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile an ethnic-Albanian group trying to seize power in part
of southern Serbia said it had lost three men in a gun battle.
</P>
<P>
   As well as coping with the Serbs, Kosovo's international
protectors have picked up some worrying and contradictory signals
from the province's Albanian politicians.
</P>
<P>
   Privately, at least, many of them confide that they would prefer
Milosevic to remain in power; that way Serbia will remain a pariah.
</P>
<P>
   More specifically, some Kosovars fear that a post-Milosevic
Serbia would compete with their province for a finite pool of
international assistance. So, in a bid to allay these fears, the EU
has assured them that the province will receive at least (euro)360
million ($306 million) next year, whatever happens in Belgrade.
</P>
<P>
   But these Machiavellian arguments are not the ones that Kosovar
politicians use in public. Instead, Hashim Thaci, the ex-commander
of the Kosovo Liberation Army guerrillas who now heads a political
party, has been stressing that the Yugoslav election is
illegitimate and that no voting for Belgrade institutions should be
taking place on Kosovar soil.
</P>
<P>
   To some ears, this may sound like a thinly-veiled call to his
supporters to stop Serbs, by force, from voting.
</P>
<P>
   Nor is it only the Serbs who feel intimidated by the two parties
which have sprung out of the ethnic-Albanian guerrilla movement.
(In addition to Thaci's PDK, there is a rival group, headed by his
erstwhile comrade-in-arms, Ramush Haradinaj.)
</P>
<P>
   Opinion polls suggest that the most popular politician among the
Kosovars is still Ibrahim Rugova, the pacifist leader who led the
province's shadow administration when it was still under direct
Serb control.
</P>
<P>
   But the United Nations fears that supporters of Rugova who do
well in the forthcoming local elections could then be attacked by
the ex-KLA parties.
</P>
<P>
   If Kosovo's internal politics are shown to be dominated by the
bullet rather than the ballet box, the western governments who keep
troops and administrators in the province will find it harder to
justify the outlay.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Kouchner has said that any party in Kosovo that uses force
will be banned from taking part in the election. But it is hard to
prove the links between acts of violence and their ultimate
sponsors; nor is it likely that the U.N. and NATO could cope with
the uproar which would ensue if an ex-KLA party was banned.
</P>
<P>
   So what is the most the Frenchman can hope to do? His best
chance lies in persuading the Kosovars to switch their attention
away from Machiavellian games, and even from the long-term aim of
independence, and concentrate instead on convincing the world that
they are proper democrats.
</P>
<P>
   Otherwise Serbia may even beat them to it. &QL;

   SYDNEY, Australia _ The unimagined has become almost a
necessity. Having lost to Spain, 3-1, in the semifinals Tuesday
night, the United States wants to bring back a medal from the
Olympic soccer competition.
</P>
<P>
   ``It would be disappointing if we didn't win one,'' said Josh
Wolff, the forward from the Chicago Fire, after the United States
was e stunned early by the offensive aggression of the Spaniards.
</P>
<P>
   Needing a medal to feel good about this excursion was hardly a
position the Yanks could afford to take when they arrived here
early in the month. They raised expectations by winning their group
and then beating Japan in the quarterfinal round, already the
farthest any U.S. men's team has gone in the Summer Games.
</P>
<P>
   Now they must play Chile, a tough squad that lost, 2-1, on a
questionable penalty call against Cameroon Tuesday night in
Melbourne. The United States and Chile will play here Friday night.
On Thursday evening, the U.S. women will defend their Olympic
championship against their traditional rival, Norway, also here, at
5 p.m. Cameroon and Spain will meet for the gold Saturday night in
Olympic Stadium.
</P>
<P>
   Tuesday night the Americans were outclassed early.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were a yard off,'' said Clive Charles, the U.S. coach who
played at the top level in his native England and totally
understands just how big a yard is in soccer.
</P>
<P>
   Spain came out smoking, sparked by Jose Mari Romero, a 6-foot
21-year-old forward who was sold by Atletico Madrid to AC Milan
last December.
</P>
<P>
   In the 17th minute Tuesday night, Romero bolted down the right
sideline, turned the corner and fired a perfect low cross, which
Raul Tamudo of Espanyol Barcelona guided home with a sliding shot.
</P>
<P>
   Eight minutes later, Romero was the key man in a second Spanish
goal. The defender, Ivan Amaya of Atletico Madrid, lofted a ball
from the right side. Romero went up for it while his marker, Dan
Califf of the Los Angeles Galaxy, slipped on the wet grass. Romero
controlled the ball near the biceps of his right arm _ a hand-ball
foul if the referee had seen it _ and the ball plopped down neatly
at his feet. He flicked a pass to Miguel Angulo of Valencia, who
had no problem tapping the ball past Brad Friedel, the reserve
goalkeeper from Liverpool.
</P>
<P>
   Admiring Romero's offense was Wolff, who is more opportunistic
than most U.S. forwards.
</P>
<P>
   ``You realize the stage you're on,'' Wolff said later. ``You
only get two or three scoring chances a game, and you have to
convert them. They're good at that. They are so talented, and they
interact. They're all on the same page.''
</P>
<P>
   The Spaniards had a 2-0 lead because they showed a sense of
privilege. At the 31st minute, Chris Albright of D.C. United, could
not pull the trigger on a centering pass from Wolff. Eight minutes
later, Charles removed Albright and Ramiro Corrales of the
MetroStars to get more offense.
</P>
<P>
   ``You show the other team what your tactics are before halftime,
which gives them time to adjust,'' Charles said. ``But we had to do
something.''
</P>
<P>
   The move paid off, as many of Charles' moves have. In the 41st
minute, Frankie Hejduk of Bayer Leverkusen in Germany collided with
Angulo in the penalty box. It was the kind of foul a referee might
not call in a tie game, but here he called it. Peter Vagenas, the
self-designated penalty kicker from the Galaxy, calmly whacked the
ball into the corner, and the margin was cut in half.
</P>
<P>
   But in the second half, Spain played more conservatively than
some of its World Cup teams have done with a lead. The United
States threw some elbows but not to much avail.
</P>
<P>
   In the 87th minute, Friedel made a two-handed punch save, only
to have Romero lurking in goalmouth for the easy rebound and the
3-1 margin.
</P>
<P>
   At the very least, the United States was not pushed around the
field the way the 1990 and 1998 World Cup squads were in Europe.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've closed the gap,'' Charles said. ``We've played European
teams. We've played everybody. The gap is closed.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The United States is making good progress,'' Inaki Saez Ruiz,
the Spanish coach, said.
</P>
<P>
   For the moment, progress is not good enough.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've never won a medal,'' said Chad McCarty of D.C. United,
the defender with the red goatee. ``Every one of us wants to win
one. It's been great so far. Every game, more and more people back
in the States are paying attention.''
</P>
<P>
   After the respective gold and bronze medal games, the players
from these two squads will return to their teams, the Spanish
players to major European teams, the Americans mostly to Major
League Soccer.
</P>
<P>
   ``We'd be all right without a medal,'' said Wolff, whose Chicago
team is about to begin a playoff series with the MetroStars. ``But
a medal would be a tangible to take back with us.'' &QL;

PLAYING, PRAYING IN EQUAL PARTS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By RON BORGES  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   MIAMI _ It has come down to this for the Patriots. It has come
down to a wing (Drew Bledsoe's) and a prayer (Lawyer Milloy's).
</P>
<P>
   ``I wanted him to catch it,'' the Patriots' iron-tough safety
was saying softly late Sunday afternoon, not long after he watched
Bledsoe loft a pass in the direction of tight end Eric Bjornson on
what is aptly called a fade route. Generally it's called that
because the receiver fades toward the corner up the sideline and
the quarterback tries to drop the ball over the defender and into
his hands. It is a delicate throw, a touch pass based on timing and
accuracy.
</P>
<P>
   However, it could be called a fade route today because that's
what the Patriots have done this season in such situations. They've
faded out of sight on plays just like that one.
</P>
<P>
   Knowing that, as the football spiraled toward Bjornson, Milloy
watched and waited. Watched and waited and prayed.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wanted our guy, for once, to come down with the ball,''
Milloy said. ``I was praying to God, `Please let this one bounce
our way.' ''
</P>
<P>
   God didn't because God isn't all that concerned about the
outcome of football games, even NFL games.
</P>
<P>
   More importantly, neither did Miami cornerback Patrick Surtain,
who held up Bjornson at the line of scrimmage just long enough so
that the tight end couldn't get to the spot he was supposed to get
to when the ball was thrown. Bjornson, frankly, also was interfered
with later in the pattern, but why talk about that? When you're
0-4, you don't get those calls at the end of a game against a team
that's 3-1, and you don't get those calls on the road in the NFL
most of the time regardless of your record.
</P>
<P>
   The point is, if you get off the line of scrimmage clean on that
play and don't let a shrimp of a corner like Surtain get his hands
on you in the first place, it's not an issue. It's a touchdown.
</P>
<P>
   But there was no touchdown and no divine intervention at the end
of Sunday's 10-3 loss, and that's how it's been at the end of all
four of the Patriots' losses. Passes uncaught (or not even thrown)
and prayers unanswered. Considering where they're headed this
Sunday, a repeat of that scenario would be considered a victory
because at the worst of times these Patriots, losers of 10 of their
last 12 games, are headed to Denver, Colo.
</P>
<P>
   It is bad enough that they will be facing an angry Broncos team
that thought it had the Kansas City Chiefs beaten Sunday only to
blow a lead and an opportunity to reassert themselves in the AFC
West. Bad enough that the Broncos are likely to have running back
Terrell Davis and quarterback Brian Griese back. Bad enough to be
on the road at all, but that is not the bad news.
</P>
<P>
   The bad news is that the last time the Patriots won in Denver,
Lyndon Johnson was president. That is a long time ago, but then
again, it feels like a long time ago since these Patriots have
beaten anybody worth talking about, so the Denver jinx is the least
of their worries.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think guys understand why we're losing,'' Bledsoe said. ``I
don't see a lack of effort. We're simply doing the wrong thing at
the wrong time.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed they are. They are doing the wrong thing or nothing at
the worst of times because they are not yet good enough to do
anything else. Eventually, if this group does not implode mentally,
it will begin to do the right things once in a while. Then, when
their personnel gets better, they will do more things right than
they do wrong when it counts and they will win.
</P>
<P>
   That won't happen often this season because they simply do not
have enough talent. What they do have is enough talent to lose
closely, as they have done time and time again. They have lost
because their margin of error is zero.
</P>
<P>
   They are not losing because they aren't working hard or being
well coached or being run ably by their quarterback. They are
losing because they are not quite good enough to make the plays you
need to make at the moments you need to make them.
</P>
<P>
   Two examples of the problem involve not two of the Patriots'
worst players but two of their best: Troy Brown and Kevin Faulk.
</P>
<P>
   Brown is one of the best slot receivers around, a solid
third-down receiver who can make plays that move the chains. But
because they have no second receiver worth playing, their third
receiver is now playing in situations that weaken the Patriots in
two spots instead of strengthening them in one. Not because Brown
is lacking but because guys like Tony Simmons end up getting 8
yards on third down when they need 9, something Brown has seldom
been guilty of.
</P>
<P>
   Then you have a good young third-down back, Faulk, playing every
down. Faulk has done a good job for the most part, but when he
fumbled Sunday on the goal line, it was typical of the problem head
coach Bill Belichick is faced with. Faulk is not the back to be in
on such a situation very often. If he were a goal line runner, he
would know the simplest rule of that trade: stay low.
</P>
<P>
   Faulk has seldom played in that situation and wouldn't be in it
now if the Patriots had a true lead back. Because of his
unfamiliarity with the job, Faulk didn't go low through what
appeared to be a gaping hole in Miami's defense; he went high and
got hammered by safety Brian Walker and fumbled in a situation in
which he normally wouldn't have even been given the ball.
</P>
<P>
   Until such personnel matters can be rectified _ and it won't be
this season _ all that Patriot fans can hope for is that the team
continues to play hard, continues to keep games close and,
eventually, makes a play or two when needed.
</P>
<P>
   Frankly, that may not come until late in the season, as it did
in 1993, when the Patriots started 0-4 under a new coach named Bill
Parcells but finished with a rush to go 5-11. That team lacked
talent, as does this one. That team had to learn how to win, as
does this one.
</P>
<P>
   That team finally figured it out, as will this one.
</P>
<P>
   They figured it out when the talent got better. It's the same
story this year. Until then, prayer can't hurt, whether God is a
football fan or not.

<P>
   PRISTINA, KOSOVO _ Which place will become a decent democracy
first _ Kosovo or Serbia proper?
</P>
<P>
   The answer will greatly affect the outcome of the unresolved
battle between the Serbs, who hope the breakaway province will
remain within their orbit, at least notionally, and Kosovo's
ethnic-Albanian leaders, who demand independence.
</P>
<P>
   If Kosovo looks incapable of becoming a decent, law-governed
state, even under western tutelage, its leaders' case for a final
break with the Yugoslav federation will weaken _ especially if
Serbia itself becomes more democratic after this weekend's
presidential and parliamentary poll in Serbia and, more
contentiously, in Montenegro.
</P>
<P>
   That may be one reason why Yugoslavia's masters have in recent
weeks been trying harder than usual to destabilize Kosovo, and make
life difficult for its international administrators, who are
preparing to hold local elections _ arguably the first above-board
test of Kosovar opinion ever conducted _ in late October.
</P>
<P>
   So far, things have been going quite well for Yugoslavia's
sitting president, Slobodan Milosevic, and other would-be wreckers.
</P>
<P>
   The foreigners running the province of Kosovo _ the United
Nations, NATO and the Organization for Security and Cooperation in
Europe _ have been struggling against mounting odds to maintain a
minimum of stability and open political debate.
</P>
<P>
   Early this month, Milosevic cunningly sent a delegation from his
Socialist party to the southern province, to urge the 100,000 or so
ethnic Serbs still living there to vote in the Yugoslav elections.
</P>
<P>
   That put Bernard Kouchner, the Frenchman who runs Kosovo for the
United Nations, on the spot. Should he allow the Serbs to cast
votes in what is still, under the terms of U.N. resolutions, their
own country?
</P>
<P>
   Or should he risk seeming weak or unfair by insisting that,
because of security problems, no residents of Kosovo could take
part in Yugoslav ballot?
</P>
<P>
   In the end, he came up with a fudge. While denouncing the
Belgrade-run contest as hopelessly flawed, he agreed that local
Serbs could take part _ and promised that NATO would do its best to
let them do so in secure conditions.
</P>
<P>
   But neither NATO nor the pro-Milosevic camp is saying anything
in advance about how exactly they expect voting to be conducted in
Kosovo's highly abnormal conditions.
</P>
<P>
   If Serbs are attacked by Albanians on the way to vote, that will
be a blow to the credibility of NATO _ as the supposed guarantor of
safety for all Kosovo's residents _ and a boost, paradoxically, for
Serb nationalist propaganda.
</P>
<P>
   With tension rising steadily, NATO troops this week raided a
Serb enclave and arrested some former and serving members of the
Yugoslav army who had infiltrated from Serbia on a mission to blow
up targets in Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile an ethnic-Albanian group trying to seize power in part
of southern Serbia said it had lost three men in a gun battle.
</P>
<P>
   As well as coping with the Serbs, Kosovo's international
protectors have picked up some worrying and contradictory signals
from the province's Albanian politicians.
</P>
<P>
   Privately, at least, many of them confide that they would prefer
Milosevic to remain in power; that way Serbia will remain a pariah.
</P>
<P>
   More specifically, some Kosovars fear that a post-Milosevic
Serbia would compete with their province for a finite pool of
international assistance. So, in a bid to allay these fears, the EU
has assured them that the province will receive at least (euro)360
million ($306 million) next year, whatever happens in Belgrade.
</P>
<P>
   But these Machiavellian arguments are not the ones that Kosovar
politicians use in public. Instead, Hashim Thaci, the ex-commander
of the Kosovo Liberation Army guerrillas who now heads a political
party, has been stressing that the Yugoslav election is
illegitimate and that no voting for Belgrade institutions should be
taking place on Kosovar soil.
</P>
<P>
   To some ears, this may sound like a thinly-veiled call to his
supporters to stop Serbs, by force, from voting.
</P>
<P>
   Nor is it only the Serbs who feel intimidated by the two parties
which have sprung out of the ethnic-Albanian guerrilla movement.
(In addition to Thaci's PDK, there is a rival group, headed by his
erstwhile comrade-in-arms, Ramush Haradinaj.)
</P>
<P>
   Opinion polls suggest that the most popular politician among the
Kosovars is still Ibrahim Rugova, the pacifist leader who led the
province's shadow administration when it was still under direct
Serb control.
</P>
<P>
   But the United Nations fears that supporters of Rugova who do
well in the forthcoming local elections could then be attacked by
the ex-KLA parties.
</P>
<P>
   If Kosovo's internal politics are shown to be dominated by the
bullet rather than the ballet box, the western governments who keep
troops and administrators in the province will find it harder to
justify the outlay.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Kouchner has said that any party in Kosovo that uses force
will be banned from taking part in the election. But it is hard to
prove the links between acts of violence and their ultimate
sponsors; nor is it likely that the U.N. and NATO could cope with
the uproar which would ensue if an ex-KLA party was banned.
</P>
<P>
   So what is the most the Frenchman can hope to do? His best
chance lies in persuading the Kosovars to switch their attention
away from Machiavellian games, and even from the long-term aim of
independence, and concentrate instead on convincing the world that
they are proper democrats.
</P>
<P>
   Otherwise Serbia may even beat them to it. &QL;

   DONGO, THE CONGO _ His name was Kabwanga Makengo. Born
Lubumbashi, June 3, 1980. Private, 2nd Brigade of the army of the
Democratic Republic of Congo. Catholic. Unmarried. The photograph
shows a baby face startled by the camera. Makengo's muddied _ or
bloodied _ identity card lay in the trench where he is buried, next
to a smashed anti-aircraft gun.
</P>
<P>
   When the rebels of the Movement for the Liberation of Congo
(MLC) took this tiny trading post on the Ubangi River on Sept. 7,
they put the 34 dead government soldiers in the trenches and
covered them over.
</P>
<P>
   This war has suddenly become more serious.
</P>
<P>
   Usually, self-preservation overcomes valor, and towns and
villages fall without a fight. But at Dongo the battle lasted five
days. Two days after surrendering, the government commander
committed suicide.
</P>
<P>
   Two years ago, Rwanda flew its troops across Congo to attack the
capital, Kinshasa, and overthrow President Laurent Kabila _ the man
Rwanda had put into power in 1997. The Rwandans and their Ugandan
allies also launched an anti-Kabila rebellion in eastern Congo.
</P>
<P>
   The attack on the capital failed when Angola, Zimbabwe and
Namibia sent troops to defend Kabila. The rebel movement in the
east split, with Uganda and Rwanda backing different sides.
</P>
<P>
   Uganda launched a third rebel movement, the MLC, in northern
Congo, training its soldiers, supplying fuel, ammunition and
weapons, and manning the heavy artillery.
</P>
<P>
   As a result the MLC has had considerable success, pushing
southwards and westwards towards the capital. It claims to be
retaking territory lost to Kabila's forces since a peace agreement
was signed in Lusaka a year ago; but neither side is in the mood
for peace.
</P>
<P>
   According to the attackers, Dongo was heavily defended by
3,000-4,000 troops. They had dug a system of trenches and, on the
promontory overlooking the river, had installed four Korean-made
anti-aircraft guns pointing at the forest. (Most African armies use
such guns against infantry forces.)
</P>
<P>
   After the battle, the trenches were carpeted with thousands of
spent cartridges. Nearby was a huge stockpile of weapons and
ammunition.
</P>
<P>
   Madeleine Albright, the American secretary of state, once called
this Africa's first world war. It is nothing like that. The armies
_ with the exception of the Congolese government's _ are small,
none of them over 20,000 strong, and they are spread out over a
sparsely-populated area the size of Western Europe, much of it
covered in jungle.
</P>
<P>
   Since there are no passable roads in Congo, this war is fought
by air and water. The aim is to control the airstrips attached to
small towns, and the rivers which are the main transport routes.
</P>
<P>
   Every gun, bullet and drop of fuel must be flown in from Uganda
and then taken by river to Dongo, or wherever the next target may
be. The troops move by dug-out canoe or walk the forest paths.
</P>
<P>
   Victory at Dongo has given the MLC rebels a huge boost, even
though _ reluctant as they are to admit it _ the battle was won by
Ugandan artillery. They have captured a treasure-trove of weapons
and about 20 prisoners, who will be ``re-educated'' and turned into
MLC fighters.
</P>
<P>
   The rebels can now move on to the junction of the Ubangi and
Congo Rivers to cut off the town of Mbandaka and, more important,
its airport, a base for bombers that have been giving the MLC
problems.
</P>
<P>
   From there, the rebels could float down the river to Kinshasa.
But that would be going further than the territory the MLC held
when the Lusaka agreement was signed last year.
</P>
<P>
   The next few weeks will decide whether that peace agreement
lives or dies. At present, it looks fatally wounded.
</P>
<P>
   The Ugandans may decide, once they have regained the territory
lost since July last year, that it would be wiser to pause and give
Kabila a chance to negotiate.
</P>
<P>
   Jean-Pierre Bemba, the MLC leader, stresses that he is committed
to the Lusaka agreement. But he will not be drawn on whether he
will stop fighting when the lost territory is reclaimed.
</P>
<P>
   He says it is up to Kabila to show his commitment to peace by
allowing a national conference to go ahead and permitting the
deployment of U.N. peacekeepers.
</P>
<P>
   Kabila has been ambiguous. He has rejected the agreed mediator,
Ketumile Masire, the former president of Botswana, and now wants
the whole Lusaka agreement renegotiated. He is unlikely to accept
the MLC's advances without reacting.
</P>
<P>
   There are already signs of panic in his army. Evidence of that
can be found in Dongo. At the back of a low hill, in a small
brick-built house, a brown-black trail of blood leads from a back
room to a patch of recently dug earth in front of the house.
</P>
<P>
   According to one survivor, Popo Mulebe, Kabila's soldiers found
him and about 50 other civilians from the village hiding in the
forest nearby. They were kept in the house for a few days and then
told to dig a pit to bury the bodies of soldiers killed in the
fighting.
</P>
<P>
   That done, the soldiers took them, 12 on one day and 34 on
another, shot them in the house and dragged their bodies to the
pit. Some of the women are still missing. &QL;

CAN GAS GIVE YOU HEADACHES? 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Q. Having suffered from headaches throughout my life, I disagree
with specialists that say they are caused by eye or neck muscle
strain. Since they are used every day the same way. I believe
headaches are caused by trapped gas within the body and are
effected by weather pressures. What's your take on this? Do you
know if any studies have been done on how body gasses, that build
up or might be trapped within the body, affect the body.
</P>
<P>
   P.C., Boston &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A. There are many reasons for having a headache, ranging from
purely psychosomatic headaches (i.e., it's all in your head, as it
were) to potentially fatal brain tumors. Muscle strain can also
certainly cause headaches, and many people find relief from this
sort of pain through massage or exercise.
</P>
<P>
   You also point out, quite correctly, that headaches can come
from trapped gas, often in the sinus cavities. Normally, pressure
inside the sinuses and outside balance each other and life is good.
If air is trapped inside (due to congestion, perhaps) and the
pressure outside drops, the air inside will push outward and this
can indeed cause pain that manifests in the form of a sinus
headache. These are usually easy to distinguish as the pain tends
to be in the face and around the eyes and clears up readily with
decongestants.
</P>
<P>
   If you go up in an airplane, as the cabin pressure drops, this
can be spectacularly painful, as I well know from personal
experience. Much the same effect can cause a painful pressure in
your ears, and you may have to do odd things like yawning or
chewing to help get the air pressure to equalize between the inside
of your head and outside.
</P>
<P>
   Trapped gas in your body is less likely to cause headaches, as
it's just a bit far away from your head, but you can certainly
experience bodily pain from gas.
</P>
<P>
   Always keep in mind that pain is your body's way of telling you
that something might be wrong. If you find yourself having
unusually frequent or painful headaches, or headaches that feel
different from what you're used to, you should definitely seek
expert medical advice.

DRESS APPROPRIATELY FOR `BANNED BOOKS WEEK'  
</HEADLINE>
   By DARYL LEASE   
 Herald-Tribune, Sarasota, Fla.   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   As an ink-stained wretch, I've always had a soft, smudgy spot in
my heart for the American Library Association's annual ``Banned
Books Week.'' I've never been quite sure what it is we're supposed
to do to observe it, though.
</P>
<P>
   We're in the midst of the holiday week right now, in fact, and
I'm at a loss again. It's not exactly a Hallmark occasion _ ``Sorry
to hear you've encountered a nose so blue. Give me a call, and I'll
read `Of Mice and Men' to you'' _ or the sort of thing you'd want
to commemorate with, say, a mug of warm cider, a wagon ride and a
big bonfire.
</P>
<P>
   Reading is an obvious possibility, of course, but for most of
us, that really wouldn't distinguish the week from any other. My
2-year-old daughter, for instance, thinks no evening is complete
without a spirited, rattle-the-rafters rendition of ``Go Dog Go!''
and at least three joyful recitations of ``Goodnight Moon.'' I
don't think I could explain this whole anti-book thing to her,
except maybe in terms of ``the old lady whispering hush.''
</P>
<P>
   We could all get together every year, I suppose, and solemnly
read excerpts from the books that were targeted at U.S. schools and
public libraries during the past year. It might do us good to read
aloud the merry-go-round scene from ``The Catcher in the Rye,'' or
recite whatever it is that people still dislike about ``To Kill a
Mockingbird.''
</P>
<P>
   Harry Potter, of all people, is a special guest on this year's
list of censored books. This puzzles me. I can't go to the local
Conglomerated Books Inc. to pick up a newspaper without tripping
over urchins zipping and buzzing about for copies of the latest
Potter best-seller.
</P>
<P>
   I haven't read more than a passage or two, but apparently these
books contain a little hoo-doo and wizardry that some people
believe to be inspired by the devil. Sorry, but I'm skeptical the
Publisher from Hell is clever enough to come up with a way to get
these kids to drop their infernal video games and Pokemon trinkets
to actually read a book.
</P>
<P>
   The work of Satan? Sounds like a miracle from above to me.
</P>
<P>
   I'm inclined to agree with Billy Smith, an 11-year-old from
Garden Grove, Calif., who's being honored at the Library of
Congress this week for an essay he wrote about his love of reading.
It seems Harry Potter inspired the young man to delve into Greek
mythology and Latin and, in turn, cast a book-reading spell over
his entire class.
</P>
<P>
   ``When they try to ban books,'' Billy says, ``it's like trying
to get rid of kids' imaginations.''
</P>
<P>
   Some people just can't get into the spirit of the season,
though. Last week, on the eve of our big banned-book extravaganza,
officials at Foley High School in Foley, Ala., yielded to a single
parent's complaint and yanked, at least temporarily, Aldous
Huxley's ``Brave New World'' from a reading list for 11th grade
students taking advanced English. The book, ranked fifth on the
Modern Library's top English-language books of the 20th century,
``is not the kind of thing the school should be reading,'' the
parent said.
</P>
<P>
   My favorite holiday story emanates from my old home state of
Virginia, where the Lynchburg City School Board recently voted to
remove a drawing of a vagina from an anatomy and physiology book
used by high school juniors and seniors. The board, amid public
ridicule, later reversed its decision.
</P>
<P>
   Board member Lee Greever, who favored removing the drawing, said
he'd received at least 10 calls from people objecting to the ``in
your face'' picture. He acknowledged that the book has ``good
parts'' but said it ``seemed to me to use unnecessarily gratuitous
nude illustrations.''
</P>
<P>
   Nude illustrations. In an anatomy book. Imagine that. The folks
at the textbook publishing company said they'd never fielded a
complaint quite like this one.
</P>
<P>
   Oddly enough, drawings of male genitals were not to be ripped
from the textbooks. Apparently they aren't gratuitous or, if they
are, Greever and crew deem them to be, uh, necessarily gratuitous.
</P>
<P>
   Regrettably, none of the news accounts I read noted what would
have happened to the offending illustrations if they had been
removed.
</P>
<P>
   Call me crazy, but I'm thinking they'd have made a rather nice
Hallmark card: ``Here, dear students, is the rest of your lesson,
in its original condition. Just be thankful no one on the School
Board was your mother's obstetrician.''

   DETROIT _ For the second time in little more than a month, Ford
is facing the recall of potentially dangerous tires.
</P>
<P>
   On Aug. 9, the company and its longtime supplier,
Bridgestone/Firestone, revealed that 6.5 million tires would need
to be replaced, the vast majority of them used on the Ford
Explorer, the world's best-selling sport-utility vehicle (SUV).
</P>
<P>
   The latest recall, announced this week, affects up to 200,000
tires supplied by Germany's Continental, mostly on Ford's Lincoln
Navigator SUV.
</P>
<P>
   Though far less serious than the first recall _ so far it has
been linked to only a few minor fender-benders and no deaths _ it
is nonetheless embarrassing for Ford.
</P>
<P>
   Nor does the rest of America's auto industry, which has come to
rely on SUVs for a disproportionate share of earnings, like the
idea of a spotlight shining on them.
</P>
<P>
   Depending on how you look at them, SUVs are either menace or
salvation. Despite their propensity to roll over more frequently
than other vehicles, a passenger is more likely to survive a crash
in an SUV than in a smaller sedan.
</P>
<P>
   That has led millions of Americans to trade their cars in for
off-roaders in recent years. But it is also prompting officials
with the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration to consider
tougher regulations on SUVs.
</P>
<P>
   Critics also fault SUVs for their below-average fuel economy.
The massive Ford Expedition does as little as ten miles a gallon;
even the mid-size Explorer falls short of 20.
</P>
<P>
   And although sales showed little impact from surging American
fuel prices last spring, fuel economy is becoming a bigger issue
among consumers.
</P>
<P>
   It seems less and less likely that the industry can maintain the
huge profit margins that SUVs have been generating _ in the
Navigator's case, $25,000 or more per unit.
</P>
<P>
   Softening sales have put a squeeze on the segment's older
models, such as the Jeep Cherokee, and manufacturers are offering
cash-back incentives of up to $3,000. These come-ons are likely to
increase, most analysts say, even if the overall American market
remains buoyant.
</P>
<P>
   A decade ago, there were barely a dozen ``sport-utes'' on the
market. Today, the number is fast approaching 70, according to
AutoPacific, a consultancy. But as many as a third are sheep in
wolves' clothing, so-called crossovers that clad a car-like body in
an SUV's macho exterior.
</P>
<P>
   They are pretty useless off the road, but few American motorists
ever drive on anything rougher than gravel anyway. On the road, by
contrast, the crossovers handle better than conventional SUVs,
deliver better fuel economy and are less prone to roll over.
</P>
<P>
   Considering what can happen when a Firestone loses its tread,
that's something the vehicles' owners will be happy to hear. &QL;

RED SOX CARRY DOUBT, QUESTIONS ON ROAD WITH THEM 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By BOB HOHLER  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ Off they went for their last hurrah, a deflated Red Sox
team Monday launching a season-ending road trip with a cargo of
questions:
</P>
<P>
   Will Nomar Garciaparra become the first righthanded hitter since
Joe DiMaggio to win consecutive American League batting titles?
</P>
<P>
   Will Pedro Martinez become the only Sox pitcher other than Roger
Clemens to win back-to-back Cy Young Awards?
</P>
<P>
   Can there be a happy ending to the frayed relationship between
Carl Everett and Jimy Williams? Or between Williams and Dan
Duquette?
</P>
<P>
   Will the Sox muster enough intensity to play out six
anticlimactic games with dignity? Or will the team that Sports
Illustrated picked to win the World Series languish a dismal third
in the American League East and finish as far back as fifth in the
wild-card race?
</P>
<P>
   Among other notable questions with short-term implications: Will
the Sox exact some payback for last month's bean brawl in Tampa Bay
when they end their season in St. Petersburg this weekend?
</P>
<P>
   The worn and weary Sox enter the twilight of the 2000 campaign
with Martinez facing the White Sox in Chicago, perhaps his last
start of an ultimately unfulfilling year.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think my numbers are good enough to win whatever,'' Martinez
said. ``But I'd trade whatever individual achievements you can give
me for a championship or a chance to go to the playoffs. If there
was a possibility, I would trade one for one right now.''
</P>
<P>
   No can do. So, Martinez and his mates will play a low-stakes
three-game series against the playoff-bound White Sox before they
head south for a three-game finale with Tampa Bay. Rookie Paxton
Crawford will start Wednesday night, and Ramon Martinez Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Williams had planned to give Pedro Martinez one more start, in
the season finale, but with so little left to fight for, the team
may choose not to risk an injury to The Franchise in such a
meaningless contest.
</P>
<P>
   The Sox could be officially eliminated from contention in the
wild-card contest as early as Tuesday. They already are toast in
the AL East.
</P>
<P>
   ``We still have six games left and we have to find a way to win
as many as we can,'' said closer Derek Lowe, whose 38 saves place
him only three behind Detroit's Todd Jones for the league lead.
</P>
<P>
   Lowe has finished 60 games this year, just one behind the league
leader, New York's Mariano Rivera. And his ERA of 2.58 ranks third
among AL relievers.
</P>
<P>
   But Lowe said the Sox, as uninspiringly as they have played
since last week's crushing Cleveland series, need to pursue more in
their final games than individual stats and accolades.
</P>
<P>
   ``Mentally, it's tough, because you know no matter what you do,
you're not going to make it to the playoffs,'' he said. ``But
you're still getting paid to play and you still have to go out
there and play as hard as you have all year.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, Lowe acknowledged, ``The intensity probably has not been
there the last couple of games.''
</P>
<P>
   Drained physically and emotionally from the three-day, five-game
showdown with the Indians that shattered their postseason dreams,
the Sox avoided getting swept by the lowly Orioles over the weekend
only when Baltimore reliever Ryan Kohlmeier walked in the winning
run in the 10th inning Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   For some of the Sox, the journey to Chicago and Tampa Bay will
be the last trip they take as part of this team _ ever. From
pitchers Tim Wakefield, Pete Schourek, and Jeff Fassero, to catcher
Scott Hatteberg and others, there are questions about where they
fit in Boston's future.
</P>
<P>
   Not to mention how the Sox front office feels about Williams
staying at the helm. Everett has made no secret of his disdain for
the manager, and the front office has yet to publicly rebuke the
slugger for it.
</P>
<P>
   ``Those of us who have been around him know he's first-class,''
Hatteberg said of Williams. ``We're going to go out there and play
as hard as we can for him because we know he's going to fight for
us. He's got my utmost respect.''
</P>
<P>
   Said Lowe, ``Hopefully, he'll be here for years to come.''
</P>
<P>
   The Sox are nearly united, though, in their lack of respect for
the Devil Rays, who responded to Martinez hitting Tampa Bay's
Gerald Williams last month by waging a war on Brian Daubach. They
repeatedly threw at Daubach, though he already had injured his left
elbow in a brawl that followed the plunking of Williams.
</P>
<P>
   The Devil Rays also hit Garciaparra in the back with a pitch.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hopefully, everything is over with,'' said Daubach, who hasn't
fully recovered from his injury. After entering the Tampa Bay
series on a hot streak, he has hit only .173 (9 for 52) since then.
</P>
<P>
   But many of the Sox are not in a forgetful frame of mind. ``What
happened there was very wrong,'' Hatteberg said. ``It left a bitter
taste in a lot of people's mouths. We don't like what happened last
time, but what happens this time is anybody's guess.''
</P>
<P>
   Martinez, in typical fashion, said he harbors no bitterness
toward Tampa Bay. It was all part of baseball, he said. And he
indicated he was more concerned about winning pennants than spite
matches.
</P>
<P>
   Martinez left town in a reflective mood, disappointed by the
team's failures. ``Even in our last game (a 1-0 loss Sunday at
Fenway), we didn't play as well as we could, but the fans were
there for us,'' he said. ``We have to keep that in our hearts and
come back next year with a different attitude, more willing to
win.''

<P>
   DETROIT _ For the second time in little more than a month, Ford
is facing the recall of potentially dangerous tires.
</P>
<P>
   On Aug. 9, the company and its longtime supplier,
Bridgestone/Firestone, revealed that 6.5 million tires would need
to be replaced, the vast majority of them used on the Ford
Explorer, the world's best-selling sport-utility vehicle (SUV).
</P>
<P>
   The latest recall, announced this week, affects up to 200,000
tires supplied by Germany's Continental, mostly on Ford's Lincoln
Navigator SUV.
</P>
<P>
   Though far less serious than the first recall _ so far it has
been linked to only a few minor fender-benders and no deaths _ it
is nonetheless embarrassing for Ford.
</P>
<P>
   Nor does the rest of America's auto industry, which has come to
rely on SUVs for a disproportionate share of earnings, like the
idea of a spotlight shining on them.
</P>
<P>
   Depending on how you look at them, SUVs are either menace or
salvation. Despite their propensity to roll over more frequently
than other vehicles, a passenger is more likely to survive a crash
in an SUV than in a smaller sedan.
</P>
<P>
   That has led millions of Americans to trade their cars in for
off-roaders in recent years. But it is also prompting officials
with the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration to consider
tougher regulations on SUVs.
</P>
<P>
   Critics also fault SUVs for their below-average fuel economy.
The massive Ford Expedition does as little as ten miles a gallon;
even the mid-size Explorer falls short of 20.
</P>
<P>
   And although sales showed little impact from surging American
fuel prices last spring, fuel economy is becoming a bigger issue
among consumers.
</P>
<P>
   It seems less and less likely that the industry can maintain the
huge profit margins that SUVs have been generating _ in the
Navigator's case, $25,000 or more per unit.
</P>
<P>
   Softening sales have put a squeeze on the segment's older
models, such as the Jeep Cherokee, and manufacturers are offering
cash-back incentives of up to $3,000. These come-ons are likely to
increase, most analysts say, even if the overall American market
remains buoyant.
</P>
<P>
   A decade ago, there were barely a dozen ``sport-utes'' on the
market. Today, the number is fast approaching 70, according to
AutoPacific, a consultancy. But as many as a third are sheep in
wolves' clothing, so-called crossovers that clad a car-like body in
an SUV's macho exterior.
</P>
<P>
   They are pretty useless off the road, but few American motorists
ever drive on anything rougher than gravel anyway. On the road, by
contrast, the crossovers handle better than conventional SUVs,
deliver better fuel economy and are less prone to roll over.
</P>
<P>
   Considering what can happen when a Firestone loses its tread,
that's something the vehicles' owners will be happy to hear. &QL;

   (UNDATED) _ What will be the hot topic at the cocktail parties
during the annual meetings of the IMF and the World Bank in Prague?
Oil prices, the euro?
</P>
<P>
   Neither: the serious gossip will be about the pay of top
policymakers and in how much luxury they travelled to the meeting.
</P>
<P>
   For this blame (or applaud) the IMF. In a new spirit of openness
the Fund has for the first time published the salaries of its top
executives in its annual report.
</P>
<P>
   Horst Kohler, the IMF's managing director, earns a total package
(including allowances) of $364,000. Oh, and that is tax-free.
</P>
<P>
   James Wolfensohn, the president of the World Bank, earns
slightly more.
</P>
<P>
   The IMF's annual report also notes that there has been an
increase in ``excessive work-related stress.'' Is this because all
staff apart from Kohler (who flew to Prague first class) now have
to rough it in business class _ along with Larry Summers, America's
treasury secretary?
</P>
<P>
   Summers earns a more modest (and taxable) $157,000.
</P>
<P>
   Alan Greenspan, the chairman of the Fed _ and arguably the most
important man in the financial world _ earns only $141,000.
</P>
<P>
   Transparency is now supposedly the buzzword of all international
organizations. Yet two of the institutions that we asked said at

grudgingly did they divulge this information. League tables of pay
need to be handled with care.
</P>
<P>
   For many of the bosses of international organizations, not only
is their salary tax free, but they often get extra perks.
</P>
<P>
   For instance Donald Johnston, the secretary-general at the OECD,
and the lowest paid (before, but not after tax) in our table, gets
a Parisian apartment with a rental value of perhaps $50,000 a year.
</P>
<P>
   It is no coincidence that pay tends to be better at the World
Bank, the IMF, and the Bank for International Settlements. None
need have their annual spending plans approved by governments. This
leaves rather more room for extravagance. &QL;

PATRIOTS ATTACK HURTS FOR TALENT 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By NICK CAFARDO  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   FOXBOROUGH, MASS. _ He blamed the execution, not the talent of
the players. That's what Bill Belichick said in the wake of a 10-3
loss to the Miami Dolphins Sunday. What else can he say?
</P>
<P>
   Belichick's defense is drawing kudos. Dolphins fullback Rob
Konrad called the Patriots defense ``the best I've played against
the last two years.''
</P>
<P>
   Offensively, there's another story to tell. A sad one.
</P>
<P>
   Some believe the Patriots must have been blindfolded when they
selected the personnel for their 2000 squad. On a team that once
had options like Curtis Martin, Sam Gash, Dave Meggett, Shawn
Jefferson, and Ben Coates, they're now relying on backup-type
players for the same production that Pro Bowl types used to give
them.
</P>
<P>
   A fade in the end zone to Eric Bjornson on fourth down? Why not?
In years pastm it was 6 points, guaranteed, when Coates would fight
off two defenders and make the play. A handoff to Kevin Faulk
inside the 5? Pretty logical. In years past, Martin brought it in
for a score.
</P>
<P>
   Lack of execution? True. But everyone knows the Patriots had
salary cap problems and weren't able to spend a lot of money on top
players so they often settled on minimum-salaried veterans, hoping
there was incentive for those players to excel.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't have a lack of confidence in the players or the
talent,'' said Belichick, who added that he would be hard-pressed
to find better players at any position. But is that based on having
no money to spend or is it because he really feels that way? The
talent, he said, ``is displayed. It's not like you can't see it.''
</P>
<P>
   Maybe Belichick can see what mere mortals can't.
</P>
<P>
   Dave Wannstedt, the Dolphins' head coach who may at some point
this season have an offensive meltdown similar to New England's,
said he game-planned defensively to stop the big play down the
field. It's what every defensive coordinator does against the
Patriots. Don't allow Terry Glenn to beat you. End of story.
</P>
<P>
   It's also obvious now that Drew Bledsoe, who injured his right
hand on a quarterback sneak in the fourth quarter, doesn't have
faith in the people he's throwing the ball to. Bledsoe used to take
more chances and lay a ball in where he knew the receiver would
make the play. Now he's throwing it only when the receiver is wide
open. He also doesn't have a security blanket to dump the ball off
to, as he used to in Coates or Martin or Gash or Keith Byars.
</P>
<P>
   Opponents know this. Deep down, Belichick knows it, too, but he
talks about execution and precision.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you put in a play and you practice it and you practice it
and you practice it, you're banking on that working in the game,''
he said. ``They practice the stuff against a three-man line,
against a zone, and a two-deep safeties and one-deep safety and we
still don't execute in the game.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's just like the second-to-last play of the game to Glenn.
Talk about double coverage and all that, but the ball didn't end up
in his hands.''
</P>
<P>
   The Patriots are now 3 for 14 in the red zone, after going 0 for
2 Sunday. What gives? Do they continue to practice, practice,
practice, hoping at some point they'll execute, execute, execute?
Or will there be changes? Whatever happened to Michael Bishop?
</P>
<P>
   When asked whether there was a scenerio in which Bishop might be
called upon, Belichick said, ``I don't see that.''
</P>
<P>
   A day after the game, after watching a game film so surreal that
it must have rivaled ``A Clockwork Orange,'' Belichick didn't seem
to have a handle on how his team would act with their backs pinned
against the wall.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can't tell you how this team is going to respond,'' said
Belichick. ``I'm sure the team is feeling some frustrations. We had
opportunities at the wire. We had the ball in our possession and we
could have made a play or two to turn things in all four games. We
didn't do that.''
</P>
<P>
   Better this way than getting blown out?
</P>
<P>
   ``Forty-nine to nothing has its own frustrations,'' said
Belichick.
</P>
<P>
   The optimist would say the Patriots are close to turning it
around. But four games in the hole, in a tough division, isn't the
reality at the moment. The pessimist would say the season is over.
Play Bishop. Play J.R. Redmond. But that isn't the reality, either.
</P>
<P>
   The reality is that the Patriots have the beef on defense to
hold down a lot of teams. But the team is lopsided: a lot of talent
on defense and much less on offense.
</P>
<P>
   It may be about precision and execution as Belichick will
insist, but as Rick Pitino once said, ``Larry Bird, Kevin McHale,
and Robert Parish aren't walking through that door.'' And neither
are Ben Coates, Curtis Martin, and Shawn Jefferson.

NICOTINE: GREAT DRUG. SHAME ABOUT ITS DELIVERY SYSTEM

<P>
   (UNDATED) _ It is decades since cigarette companies advertised
the health-giving properties of their products, but it has been
suspected for some time that cigarettes, for all their harmful
effects, serve to protect people against Parkinson's disease.
</P>
<P>
   Not only do smokers suffer less from Parkinson's than their
abstemious counterparts, but those who do develop it frequently
have a milder form.
</P>
<P>
   And Parkinson's is not the only illness that tobacco seems to
help. Psychiatrists have observed for many years that cigarette
smoking is almost ubiquitous among people with schizophrenia,
leading to suggestions that this activity is a form of
self-medication.
</P>
<P>
   No one, of course, is suggesting that smoking is a healthy thing
to do, even for those with Parkinson's or schizophrenia. But these
observations have led researchers to experiment with more
controlled doses of nicotine, the drug that makes smoking tobacco
so desirable and addictive.
</P>
<P>
   The results may surprise those who see the weed as an embodiment
of evil, for those studies suggest that nicotine administered by
injection or by a skin patch can alleviate the symptoms not only of
Parkinson's disease, but also of Alzheimer's disease and Tourette's
syndrome.
</P>
<P>
   All of which is leading to a more systematic investigation of
nicotine as a treatment in its own right, and a search for similar
molecules that have the same, or even enhanced, effects without
suffering from the dreaded association with tobacco and all its
ills.
</P>
<P>
   Nicotine works by stimulating the production of a chemical
called dopamine. This substance is a neurotransmitter _ one of
several dozen chemical messengers that carry signals from one nerve
cell to another.
</P>
<P>
   The reason that smoking is fun is that dopamine is part of the
nervous circuitry involved in the perception of pleasure. Nicotine
actually exerts its effect by mimicking a second neurotransmitter
called acetylcholine.
</P>
<P>
   Dopamine-producing nerve cells have acetylcholine-receptor
molecules on their surfaces. When these so-called nicotinic
receptors are occupied by acetylcholine molecules, a cell is
encouraged to churn out dopamine.
</P>
<P>
   Nicotine is sufficiently similar to acetylcholine for it to be
able to lock into these receptors, artificially encouraging
dopamine production. Dopamine, however, has roles other than the
generation of a feel-good factor.
</P>
<P>
   Both Parkinson's and Alzheimer's diseases, for example, are
associated with a dopamine deficit. So attacking them with nicotine
seems worth a try.
</P>
<P>
   Pursuing this line of reasoning, Paul Newhouse, a psychiatrist
at the University of Vermont, and his colleagues, have been
administering the stuff to their Parkinson's and Alzheimer's
patients. And they have, indeed, found that people with Parkinson's
disease are better able to stand up, walk and resume sitting
following the administration of nicotine.
</P>
<P>
   They also saw enhanced learning and memory skills in these
patients and in a group of people with Alzheimer's disease that
they tested.
</P>
<P>
   All this has prompted drug companies to ask themselves if they
can improve on nicotine (and, of course, produce a patentable
product as opposed to a drug that anyone can sell).
</P>
<P>
   One such company, Abbott Laboratories, has already embarked on
trials of a compound called ABT-418, which stimulates nicotinic
receptors. Dr. Newhouse and his colleagues have tested ABT-418 in a
small number of patients with Parkinson's and Alzheimer's diseases,
with promising results.
</P>
<P>
   That, given the evidence from smokers, and the way that nicotine
works, is encouraging, but not surprising.
</P>
<P>
   The unexpected finding is that nicotine also appears to help
children with Tourette's syndrome _ curious, given that this
disease is caused not by a lack of dopamine, but by a surfeit.
</P>
<P>
   Tourette's syndrome is marked by movements such as shoulder
shrugging, eye blinking and head jerking, as well as bizarre vocal
tics including barking and uncontrollable outbursts of profanity.
</P>
<P>
   Its sufferers are often treated with haloperidol, which blocks
the receptor molecules that dopamine stimulates, but this drug does
not work well in everyone and can have unpleasant side-effects.
</P>
<P>
   Paul Sanberg, a neuroscientist at the University of South
Florida in Tampa, and his colleagues, have found that a nicotine
patch enhances the ability of haloperidol to suppress the symptoms
of Tourette's.
</P>
<P>
   According to Dr. Sanberg, the paradox of nicotine use in this
case is explained because the drug is being administered
continuously, via a patch, thus overloading the nicotinic
receptors. Although the nicotine at first stimulates dopamine
production, eventually the receptors become flooded with nicotine
and shut down.
</P>
<P>
   Cigarettes, by contrast, deliver nicotine in small, short-lived
jolts. The patch is no panacea. At least 70 percent of the children
tested developed extreme nausea from it. Nevertheless, Tourette's
syndrome is so distressing to patients and their families that
doctors who treat the disorder are getting more and more requests
for nicotine patches.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, in America, the Tourette Syndrome Association felt it
necessary to issue a statement warning of the paucity of long-term
safety data, especially in children, and the potential interactions
of nicotine with drugs given to treat the syndrome. But even though
it has its problems, nicotine points the way to better treatments
for Tourette's too. &QL;
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
    &UR; (STORY CAN END HERE AT 850, OR CONTINUE TO 1,075) &LR;  &QC; 
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Dr. Sanberg and his colleagues are currently testing one of
those _ a compound called mecamylamine. This was developed some
years ago by Merck to treat high blood pressure, and it works by
blocking nicotinic receptors on the nerve cells that control that
pressure, thus preventing the release of dopamine. (Yet another of
that neurotransmitter's roles is in the regulation of blood
pressure.)
</P>
<P>
   Mecamylamine can be taken in pill form and does not produce the
nausea associated with a nicotine patch. When administered in a
preliminary trial to 24 patients with Tourette's syndrome it
provided significant relief to 22 of them.
</P>
<P>
   In the meantime, says Dr. Sanberg, people with Tourette's
syndrome who have not responded to more conventional therapies have
nothing to lose by asking their doctors to prescribe mecamylamine,
perhaps to take in addition to their current medication.
</P>
<P>
   He also believes that further studies of the nicotinic receptor
system in the brain could shed light on other psychiatric diseases,
including schizophrenia, bipolar disorder and
attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder.
</P>
<P>
   For these and other conditions, he says, nicotine and its
relatives offer an alternative line of attack to that used by
existing drugs. And there are, after all, few things more
satisfying than converting an ancient enemy into a bosom friend. &QL;

WEB SLOW TO RESHAPE POLITICAL REPORTING 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By ROSS KERBER 
c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   The Web hasn't changed political news coverage much _ yet.
</P>
<P>
   That's the view among political professionals, Web specialists,
and political reporters who have watched the rise of the new medium
with varying degrees of enthusiasm and concern.
</P>
<P>
   Already, some are disappointed. For years, the Web has been seen
as a technology that could reinvigorate democracy, by creating
direct communication channels among the governed and by opening
dialogue with public officials. To date, it has blurred the lines
between news organizations and political Web sites, as both compete
to offer information to voters and to fact-check the claims of
opposition candidates.
</P>
<P>
   Plus, a host of start-up companies calling themselves
``democracy portals'' want to serve the same market. At
Grassroots.com, for instance, users can read about Senator Joseph
I. Lieberman's predictions on voter turnout or read comments on
George W. Bush's environmental voting record from a Gainesville,
Fla., nurse using the screen name ``RationalMind.''
</P>
<P>
   Ultimately sites like these promise to ``make national politics
truly national,'' according to Governor Jim Gilmore of Virginia.
Gilmore, a Republican, has emerged as one of the Web's biggest
boosters.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
------ &QC; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   But even Gilmore says he can't name an example in which an
online news item or coverage on the the Web has altered the
dynamics of his campaigning and governing. The most persistent
questions still come from reporters from traditional news
organizations, and their output remains the most widely read source
of information for most voters.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're just beginning the process of the application of the
Internet to the political process,'' Gilmore said.
</P>
<P>
   For one thing, reporters from traditional news organization,
like the Dallas Morning News, whose questions have created the most
difficulties for Bush. In contrast, the most talked-about Web
journalism this year was probably a piece by Dan Savage, a writer
for Salon.com. In his piece, ``Stalking Gary Bauer,'' Savage
described licking office doorknobs in an effort to spread a cold
and derail the conservative candidate's campaign.
</P>
<P>
   Early expectations for the Web were probably too lofty. One
basic problem is that slow connections for most viewers limit the
Web's ability to offer compelling video. ``The concepts are true,
that the Web will change things,'' said Dana Milbank, who writes
about politics for The Washington Post. ``But the promise hasn't
been realized. It will have a profound effect on politics, but not
in this cycle. Probably in the next one.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
----- &QC; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps the most significant impact of the Web has been to bring
print media into a constant-news mindset, a change cable-television
news had already forced on the networks. Now newspapers and
magazines are also pressing their reporters to write quick, short
versions of their stories for the Web during the day, much as
newspapers used to update themselves with afternoon editions.
</P>
<P>
   ``The concept of a news cycle is almost passe,'' said Jeff
Zeleny, who covered the Iowa caucuses for the Des Moines Register
and now writes for the Chicago Tribune. ``I found myself filing
Internet updates and posting stuff from the trail all day long.''
</P>
<P>
   Attention to the Web's impact on politics began in earnest
during the 1996 election cycle, the first time both major
presidential candidates invited users to visit their campaign
operations online. Since then, operatives have proved the Web can
be used as an effective campaign tool in specific instances.
</P>
<P>
   At the height of the impeachment proceedings against President
Clinton, for instance, even Republicans acknowledged the
Democratic-leaning site, MoveOn.org, which drew 500,000 signatures
and pledges of $13 million to urge Congress to move on to weightier
topics. During his campaign for president, Senator John McCain
often mentioned his Web site; in the two days after his victory in
the New Hampshire primary, he raised $1 million with the help of
his Web site, according to PoliticsNow.com.

NICOTINE: GREAT DRUG. SHAME ABOUT ITS DELIVERY SYSTEM

<P>
   (UNDATED) _ It is decades since cigarette companies advertised
the health-giving properties of their products, but it has been
suspected for some time that cigarettes, for all their harmful
effects, serve to protect people against Parkinson's disease.
</P>
<P>
   Not only do smokers suffer less from Parkinson's than their
abstemious counterparts, but those who do develop it frequently
have a milder form.
</P>
<P>
   And Parkinson's is not the only illness that tobacco seems to
help. Psychiatrists have observed for many years that cigarette
smoking is almost ubiquitous among people with schizophrenia,
leading to suggestions that this activity is a form of
self-medication.
</P>
<P>
   No one, of course, is suggesting that smoking is a healthy thing
to do, even for those with Parkinson's or schizophrenia. But these
observations have led researchers to experiment with more
controlled doses of nicotine, the drug that makes smoking tobacco
so desirable and addictive.
</P>
<P>
   The results may surprise those who see the weed as an embodiment
of evil, for those studies suggest that nicotine administered by
injection or by a skin patch can alleviate the symptoms not only of
Parkinson's disease, but also of Alzheimer's disease and Tourette's
syndrome.
</P>
<P>
   All of which is leading to a more systematic investigation of
nicotine as a treatment in its own right, and a search for similar
molecules that have the same, or even enhanced, effects without
suffering from the dreaded association with tobacco and all its
ills.
</P>
<P>
   Nicotine works by stimulating the production of a chemical
called dopamine. This substance is a neurotransmitter _ one of
several dozen chemical messengers that carry signals from one nerve
cell to another.
</P>
<P>
   The reason that smoking is fun is that dopamine is part of the
nervous circuitry involved in the perception of pleasure. Nicotine
actually exerts its effect by mimicking a second neurotransmitter
called acetylcholine.
</P>
<P>
   Dopamine-producing nerve cells have acetylcholine-receptor
molecules on their surfaces. When these so-called nicotinic
receptors are occupied by acetylcholine molecules, a cell is
encouraged to churn out dopamine.
</P>
<P>
   Nicotine is sufficiently similar to acetylcholine for it to be
able to lock into these receptors, artificially encouraging
dopamine production. Dopamine, however, has roles other than the
generation of a feel-good factor.
</P>
<P>
   Both Parkinson's and Alzheimer's diseases, for example, are
associated with a dopamine deficit. So attacking them with nicotine
seems worth a try.
</P>
<P>
   Pursuing this line of reasoning, Paul Newhouse, a psychiatrist
at the University of Vermont, and his colleagues, have been
administering the stuff to their Parkinson's and Alzheimer's
patients. And they have, indeed, found that people with Parkinson's
disease are better able to stand up, walk and resume sitting
following the administration of nicotine.
</P>
<P>
   They also saw enhanced learning and memory skills in these
patients and in a group of people with Alzheimer's disease that
they tested.
</P>
<P>
   All this has prompted drug companies to ask themselves if they
can improve on nicotine (and, of course, produce a patentable
product as opposed to a drug that anyone can sell).
</P>
<P>
   One such company, Abbott Laboratories, has already embarked on
trials of a compound called ABT-418, which stimulates nicotinic
receptors. Dr. Newhouse and his colleagues have tested ABT-418 in a
small number of patients with Parkinson's and Alzheimer's diseases,
with promising results.
</P>
<P>
   That, given the evidence from smokers, and the way that nicotine
works, is encouraging, but not surprising.
</P>
<P>
   The unexpected finding is that nicotine also appears to help
children with Tourette's syndrome _ curious, given that this
disease is caused not by a lack of dopamine, but by a surfeit.
</P>
<P>
   Tourette's syndrome is marked by movements such as shoulder
shrugging, eye blinking and head jerking, as well as bizarre vocal
tics including barking and uncontrollable outbursts of profanity.
</P>
<P>
   Its sufferers are often treated with haloperidol, which blocks
the receptor molecules that dopamine stimulates, but this drug does
not work well in everyone and can have unpleasant side-effects.
</P>
<P>
   Paul Sanberg, a neuroscientist at the University of South
Florida in Tampa, and his colleagues, have found that a nicotine
patch enhances the ability of haloperidol to suppress the symptoms
of Tourette's.
</P>
<P>
   According to Dr. Sanberg, the paradox of nicotine use in this
case is explained because the drug is being administered
continuously, via a patch, thus overloading the nicotinic
receptors. Although the nicotine at first stimulates dopamine
production, eventually the receptors become flooded with nicotine
and shut down.
</P>
<P>
   Cigarettes, by contrast, deliver nicotine in small, short-lived
jolts. The patch is no panacea. At least 70 percent of the children
tested developed extreme nausea from it. Nevertheless, Tourette's
syndrome is so distressing to patients and their families that
doctors who treat the disorder are getting more and more requests
for nicotine patches.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, in America, the Tourette Syndrome Association felt it
necessary to issue a statement warning of the paucity of long-term
safety data, especially in children, and the potential interactions
of nicotine with drugs given to treat the syndrome. But even though
it has its problems, nicotine points the way to better treatments
for Tourette's too. &QL;
</P>

<P>
   TEHRAN _ When one of the walls of the old American Embassy in
central Tehran was sandblasted recently and made sparkling clean,
rumor ran wild.
</P>
<P>
   The Americans were coming back, Iranians predicted. Nonsense,
said officialdom: the embassy, now used as a training base for the
elite Revolutionary Guards, is about to be leased commercially.
</P>
<P>
   That was true, as it turned out. But behind the misleading whiff
of smoke there was at least some fire.
</P>
<P>
   In recent weeks, high-ranking Iranian and American dignitaries
have begun to meet in intriguing ways. A number of Iranian MPs,
including Mehdi Karroubi, the speaker of the parliament, ran into
several American congressmen earlier this month at a reception at
the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York. Both groups were there
for a conference of world parliamentarians.
</P>
<P>
   Coincidence, said Karroubi, a veteran revolutionary cleric who
tries to maintain ties to both the reformist and conservative
camps. He just happened to bump into the congressmen, he told
Iran's hard-line newspapers, while touring the museum. Few believed
him.
</P>
<P>
   That was only the first of a series of ``accidental
encounters.'' At about the same time as Karroubi was appreciating
art in the Met, a band of accredited American diplomats managed to
slip in and out of Iran for an agricultural conference.
</P>
<P>
   A small news item appeared in one Iranian newspaper. When
officials were formally questioned, no one seemed to be aware that
American officials had touched Iranian soil.
</P>
<P>
   Then, last week, Madeleine Albright, the American secretary of
state, attended a United Nations conference on Afghanistan with
Iran's foreign minister, Kamal Kharrazi. It was one of the few
high-level contacts between the two sides since the 1979 Islamic
revolution.
</P>
<P>
   An Iranian spokesman played down the meeting, saying that Mrs.
Albright and Kharrazi sat on opposite sides of the table and did
not speak. But they got close, relatively speaking.
</P>
<P>
   What all this posturing and gesturing reveals is that both sides
in Iran, reformist and conservative, would like to see an end to
the 21-year rift in relations.
</P>
<P>
   For the first time, the conservative establishment has admitted
what it once acknowledged only in private: that Iran can no longer
afford to snub the Great Satan.
</P>
<P>
   The public also takes that view. An opinion poll published last
week showed that 55 percent of Iranians surveyed would support
restored ties with the United States.
</P>
<P>
   The reasons are economic. First, Iran's merchant class, who are
firm supporters of the clerical establishment, are losing lucrative
import-export contracts.
</P>
<P>
   The United States announced in March that it was easing
sanctions against Iran by allowing the import of three luxury
items: carpets, pistachios and caviar. But these items entered
European markets long ago, and the gains from discerning American
nibblers are unlikely to mean any sharp increase in profits for
Iranians.
</P>
<P>
   Second, and more important, the vital oil sector needs America
as a source of both technology and investment.
</P>
<P>
   American oil firms were shut out of the Iranian market five
years ago when President Bill Clinton imposed a unilateral embargo.
Since then, they have been obliged to cool their heels while
European companies have lined up to sign contracts for lucrative
Iranian oil and gas projects.
</P>
<P>
   Although there have been rampant rumors that American oil firms
are continuing to do business with Iran through middlemen and front
companies, the firms are putting increasing pressure on Washington
to lift the sanctions officially.
</P>
<P>
   While he was in New York, Karroubi also held meetings with
representatives of Conoco, Chevron and Exxon Mobil.
</P>
<P>
   Pro-reform Iranian economists estimate that American sanctions
and their ripple effects _ the drag on inward investment, the
reliance on black-market and grey-market suppliers, the higher cost
of capital and the lack of easy access to spare parts for the large
installed base of American-made infrastructure _ are slowing the
Iranian economy by 10-15 percent a year.
</P>
<P>
   This comes at a time when Iran must grow, and must produce at
least 750,000 new jobs each year, to keep pace with its surging
population.
</P>
<P>
   The United States will not lift sanctions completely, it
insists, until Iran ends its support for Islamic militant groups
such as Hezbollah, which waged a 18-year resistance against the
Israeli occupation of southern Lebanon. America continues to accuse
Iran of backing Hezbollah, despite Iran's insistence that it halted
such funding years ago.
</P>
<P>
   The United States also claims, against strong Iranian denials,
that Iran is seeking to develop nuclear weapons and long-range
missile technology.
</P>
<P>
   For its part, the United States has offered more than gestures.
Last March, in the most conciliatory speech to date, Mrs. Albright
said the United States regretted the Central Intelligence Agency's
involvement in the 1953 coup that overthrew Prime Minister Mohammad
Mossadegh and brought back the Shah.
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Albright's statement may have been a big step for the
Americans, but Iran wants an official apology _ for that, and quite
a few other things as well. If and when that day comes, the
graffiti covering an adjoining wall of the former American Embassy
_ ``Down with the USA'' _ may fall victim to the sandblaster too. &QL;

<TEXT>
<P>
   During a recent drive through his hometown of Inglewood, Calif.,
Celtics forward/guard Paul Pierce pointed out gang graffiti as he
made his way down dangerous streets. He parked his Mercedes-Benz
outside Rogers Park, where he'd played pickup games as a child, and
surveyed the scene before venturing outside.
</P>
<P>
   Pierce always exercises caution. He hangs out with trusted
friends. He carries his celebrity lightly, stashing a basketball
and an extra pair of sneakers in his trunk in case anyone
challenges him to a game of one-on-one. Pierce, 22, experienced
enough things growing up in Inglewood to avoid situations where
trouble might find him.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've got friends who got shot here,'' said Pierce that day
while leaving Rogers Park.
</P>
<P>
   ``You've got to be careful. Anytime. You never know what's going
to happen. Inglewood's a place where a lot of people are hustling.
You never know what's on anybody's agenda. I was just fortunate to
grow up with the right people.''
</P>
<P>
   But early Monday morning, while attending a private party at the
Buzz Club in Boston, Pierce was the victim of a stabbing. He
suffered multiple wounds to the neck, back, and face, and was
listed in fair condition at New England Medical Center after
undergoing surgery. The attack shocked those closest to Pierce, who
know him as someone who does not take chances with his personal
safety.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've been out a couple of times with him at various places and
parties,'' said Patrick Roy, Pierce's coach at Inglewood High
School coach and a friend. ``Paul is very conservative at parties,
so when you hear he was stabbed 11 times to the front, back, and
neck, it's real scary. Paul has seen his share of violence.
Definitely living in that situation makes you aware of what's out
there. After getting to the NBA, he became even more cautious.''
</P>
<P>
   Following three years at the University of Kansas, Pierce
arrived in Boston as the 10th overall pick in the 1998 NBA draft.
Last season, he averaged 19.5 points, 5.4 rebounds, and 3.0
assists, and he ranked second in the league with 2.08 steals per
game.
</P>
<P>
   Pierce had vowed to ``unleash the dragon'' and take his game to
another level this year.
</P>
<P>
   When Pierce was a child, his single mother, Lorraine Hosey,
thought sports were the best way to keep her three sons off the
streets. Hosey made sure they stayed far away from the crime and
gangs that were ever-present in Inglewood.
</P>
<P>
   ``I brought Paul to school and I picked him up,'' said Hosey.
``I made sure (he was safe). I was really concerned because I
didn't want him to get in with the wrong crowd. I was so happy when
he focused on basketball the way he did. He would be in the gym
from the time he got out of school until I picked him up.''
</P>
<P>
   Pierce said gangs tried to get him to join, ``but you see what's
going on and you don't want to get caught up in the crossfire.
Basketball kept me out of that.''
</P>
<P>
   Though he dabbled with baseball and football, basketball became
his obsession. He saw Magic Johnson drive down Manchester Boulevard
to Lakers games at the Forum. At Rogers Park, he watched NBA
players practice their moves. At the ``dunking courts'' across from
the Forum, where the baskets were lowered to 8 1/2 feet, he
dreamed.
</P>
<P>
   Making the dream a reality was never a certainty. With a mix of
frustration and resignation, Pierce sat on the bench in high school
for eight straight games at the start of his sophomore season. He
was blessed with a deft shooting touch but cursed with an
overweight, 5-foot-10-inch frame. Finally given the chance to play
in a Christmas tournament, Pierce showed his talent. After almost
being demoted to junior varsity, he soon earned a varsity starting
spot.
</P>
<P>
   He worked out at 5:30 every morning before school, setting
higher and higher goals, until he became a McDonald's All-American.
He maintains that work ethic and passion for the game. Over the
summer, he reviewed each Celtics game from last season at least
three times.
</P>
<P>
   Though Pierce takes his personal safety and basketball
seriously, he jokes and smiles about everything else. Asked to
describe Pierce, his former Kansas teammates recalled his work
ethic as well as his penchant for practical jokes, his attempts to
lighten the mood during team dinners and team meetings.
</P>
<P>
   A recent visit to Inglewood High brought out the prankster in
Pierce. He walked into the basketball office and asked for Coach
Roy. Told Roy was not around, Pierce conned two new administrators
into believing he was a transfer student from Mississippi, ready to
start his senior year and try out for a spot on the basketball team
as a 6-foot-7-inch, 220-pound forward.
</P>
<P>
   ``Well, tell Coach Roy that Paul stopped by,'' said Pierce.
``And I hope I see you for all the right reasons this year.''
</P>
<P>
   He left the office with the administrators none the wiser.
</P>
<P>
   Pierce's easygoing manner arises from the confidence of being a
professional basketball player, as well as the good advice he
received along the way.
</P>
<P>
   Scott Collins, a detective with the Inglewood Police who is a
surrogate father to Pierce, said recently, ``We had a lot of long
talks, not about basketball, but about being successful in life. I
told him, `You've got to be happy in who you are.' Also, I told
him, `Always remember that people know you. If you are out, be
careful who you hang with. It's best to stand on your own. If
you're going to make a mistake doing something, make it because you
decided to do it. Always have your eyes open. Think that someone's
always watching.' ''
</P>
<P>
   Early Monday morning, unfortunately, someone was watching.

<P>
   SYDNEY, Australia _ After you've done seven years of hard time
in the Illinois State Penitentiary with guys named Pharaoh and
Mongoose, nothing much figures to scare you, not even a 6-foot-6
Cuban named Felix Savon.
</P>
<P>
   That's the attitude former convict turned Olympic boxer Michael
Bennett took into his Tuesday afternoon heavyweight bout against
Cuba's latest Lord of the Ring.
</P>
<P>
   It didn't matter to Bennett that Savon was a two-time Olympic
gold medalist and six-time world champion. What mattered was
Savon's superior height and reach advantage.
</P>
<P>
   With his pedigree and physical skills, the 33-year-old Savon
easily dispatched the 29-year-old American from Chicago in their
quarterfinal fight. Under amateur boxing rules, when Savon built up
a 23-8 lead at the end of three rounds in the four-round contest,
the referee was mandated to stop the fight.
</P>
<P>
   ``RSCO'' is the official designation _ referee stops
contest/outclassed. At any point in a bout when a boxer has a
15-point lead, the fight is stopped.
</P>
<P>
   Bennett lasted about the same as teammate Jeff Lacy, who was
stopped late in the third round of his quarterfinal fight with
Gaidarbek Gaidarbekov. The 165-pound Russian was awarded the
victory when his lead increased to 18-3 late in the third round.
</P>
<P>
   The losses mean the U.S. team will not match its medal total in
Atlanta, where American boxers won one gold and five bronze medals.
</P>
<P>
   Neither of the American boxers objected to the decision to stop
his bout.
</P>
<P>
   ``Rules are rules,'' Bennett said. ``I have no quarrels over it.
If that's the way it has to be done, that's the way it has to be
done. I can't complain . . . I'm pleased. I feel OK, as long as my
heart is in the right place.''
</P>
<P>
   For the last two years Bennett's heart and mind have been in the
right place, the straight and narrow world of people going about
their business in a law-abiding manner. It wasn't always thus.
</P>
<P>
   In 1991, Bennett was attending college in the Chicago area and
working part-time at UPS. By his admission, ``I started hanging out
with the wrong guy over the summer.'' The wrong guy persuaded him
to come along for a stick-up of a Toys R Us store.
</P>
<P>
   Thus, Bennett became the Toy Store Bandit and was sent to the
big house on a 26-year stretch for armed robbery and unlawful
aggravated restraint. As a first-time offender, Bennett had his
sentence sliced to 15 years. He was released after seven for good
behavior.
</P>
<P>
   While in prison, three cons serving a combined 440 years for
murder, attempted murder and armed robbery took a liking to Bennett
. . . no, not that way. His prison experience was nothing like the
HBO series ``Oz.'' Pharaoh (Harry Jenkins), Mongoose (Earl Good)
and Papa Sun (Isaiah Spann) taught the 20-year-old to box.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'll never forget them,'' Bennett told the Chicago Sun-Times.
``I wanted to stay physically fit and I grew to like boxing. They
taught me the fundamentals. They passed their knowledge to me along
the way.''
</P>
<P>
   Bennett was released on July 29, 1998. By all accounts, he's
been a model citizen. He earned a college degree and a spot on the
Olympic team in the heavyweight class, although he's not
particularly imposing at 6 feet and 198 pounds.
</P>
<P>
   Now Savon, he's imposing. His 201 pounds are stretched along his
6-6 frame, his arms as long as sugarcane stalks but quite a bit
thicker.
</P>
<P>
   Savon used those arms to great advantage in the bout at the
Sydney Convention Center. He jabbed away at Bennett in the first
round and emerged with a 7-2 lead.
</P>
<P>
   Bennett scored with a left in the second round but a straight
right and a right uppercut by Savon enabled him to win the round
10-4 for a 17-6 advantage entering the third round. When the Cuban
won the third round 6-2 to lead by 15 points, the fight was
stopped.
</P>
<P>
   Not even the presence of former heavyweight champion Evander
Holyfield at ringside urging him on could help Bennett.
</P>
<P>
   ``I gave him too many straight shots,'' Bennett said. ``I stood
in front of him a lot. I gave up too many shots. He's a single-shot
fighter and I gave him too many chances. . . . I should have been
able to cut the reach off but I was a step too slow to take his
advantage away.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's a true warrior. He's done a lot for amateur boxing. He
deserves what he's got.''
</P>
<P>

</P>

   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS.) &QL; 
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The difference between Savon's 395 amateur fights and Bennett's
60 was too great for the American to overcome. Bennett tried to
counteract Savon's superior reach by crouching and looking for an
opening, but the referee warned him several times to keep his head
up.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was kind of difficult to get past that,'' Bennett said. ``I
can't let that be a factor. It was between me and Savon and he was
the better man.''
</P>
<P>
   Bennett said he is unsure of his post-Sydney plans. He might
turn pro, although 29 is an advanced age to be getting into the
punch-for-pay racket. He might work with children, serving as a
mentor, in much the same way _ but in a vastly different context _
that Pharaoh, Mongoose and Papa Sun did for him behind the bars and
the barbed wire.
</P>
<P>
   Whatever he decides to do, Bennett at 29 seems to be a different
man than he was at 20. That's why he wasn't distraught over his
loss to Savon.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm healthy, mentally and physically,'' Bennett said. ``I did
my best. I can't be anything but happy. I reached for my star and I
fell short.''

<P>
   WESTBOROUGH, Mass. _ When Informix announced in August that it
would move its headquarters here from posh Menlo Park, Calif., the
bicoastal headlines could not have been more different.
</P>
<P>
   On the West Coast, readers of the San Jose Mercury News were
told, ``Informix Bows Out of Silicon Valley.'' In the East, the
Worcester Telegram &AMP; Gazette's headline celebrated the
cross-country move and the creation of ``About 100 Jobs.''
</P>
<P>
   So is Informix a defeated company, exiting with its tail between
its legs? Or is it a corporate hero, creating jobs in this edge
town outside the Interstate 495 arc?
</P>
<P>
   In the longstanding rivalry between the Bay State and the Bay
Area for the gold medal in cutting-edge technology, the title still
belongs to Silicon Valley. But what may be most significant about
Informix's decision to move its headquarters east is what it says
about the shifting relationship between east and west.
</P>
<P>
   There have been others. In recent months, PlanetRX.com, InsWeb
Corp., Performance Polymer Technologies, and Galil Motion Control
have decamped from Silicon Valley altogether. Travelocity,
Pets.com, and Egghead.com have joined Informix in moving some
company divisions out of the Valley.
</P>
<P>
   Informix executives say that being in Westborough amounts to a
25 percent reduction in rent, based on the terms of their lease. If
they were to pay today's market rates, the differential would be
even greater, over 60 percent, said Tony Riggio, the company's
director of public relations.
</P>
<P>
   To be sure, Silicon Valley's cachet continues to attract as many
technology companies as it loses. And Informix isn't technically
leaving California. Though its corporate headquarters will be in
Westborough, the majority of its workers will remain on the West
Coast.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're really just moving two exits down the road,'' said Peter
Fiore, president of Informix's services and consulting business.
</P>
<P>
   Informix, which is battling flat revenues and disappointing
earnings, is effectively splitting the company in two. One company
_ Informix Software, headed by James D. Foy _ will be based in Palo
Alto. The other, a yet-to-be-named e-business consulting and
services firm headed by Fiore, will be based in Westborough.
</P>
<P>
   Which coast is getting the better half of Informix?
</P>
<P>
   Some would say it's Silicon Valley, which is getting the part of
the company that generates $800 million in annual sales, or 85
percent of the comany's total revenues.
</P>
<P>
   Others would argue it's Massachusetts. While the Westborough
subsidiary is forecast to have just over $120 million in sales this
year, it is expected to grow 80 percent to 100 percent next year.
</P>
<P>
   The Bay State will also be home to the parent company, Informix
Corp., which ended up in Massachusetts when it acquired
fast-growing Ardent Software in March for $1.1 billion.
</P>
<P>
   The company's new chief executive, Peter Gyenes, was president
of Ardent, and half of Informix's senior management team also came
from the Westborough-based firm.
</P>
<P>
   ``Even though Ardent was the company being acquired, their key
managers turned out to be very sharp and capable,'' said Hurwitz.
As a result, the locus of leadership shifted towards Massachusetts,
she said. ``The talent for the more dynamic part of their business
turned out to be here.''
</P>
<P>
   The irony is that Silicon Valley, ground zero for all things
futuristic, is ending up with the slow-growing technology business,
while Massachusetts, once known for its dying minicomputer
industry, is ending up with the cutting-edge firm.
</P>
<P>
   ``The truth is that both coasts win in this,'' said Fiore,
downplaying the competition. ``They each get a company.''
</P>
<P>
   True enough. But what's different is that Massachusetts is
clearly back in the race.
</P>

<P>
   They call their venture group, conspicuously, EMC.
</P>
<P>
   But they're quick to point out that their group is not an arm of
the computer storage giant in Hopkinton, Mass. Rather, EMC is short
for Egan Managed Capital, a pool of family money that's invested in
early-stage start-ups for EMC founder Richard Egan.
</P>
<P>
   Neither the Egans nor the partners in the fund mind the
confusion over the name.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was Dick's idea. The name helps,'' said Mike Shanahan, one

guru.

   Since its founding in February 1997, Egan Managed Capital has
done about 20 deals and claims to have reaped triple-digit returns
each year. Winners include Network Engines, a $3 million investment
that turned out to be worth more than $100 million, and Epicon, a
$1 million investment on which Egan made about 13 times its money.
Egan also invested in Caldera Systems, a Linux company, and Top
Layer Networks, a switch maker.
</P>
<P>
   ``This has turned out to be even better than we expected,''
Shanahan said.
</P>
<P>
   The Egans are happy enough to have renewed their venture capital
commitment. They recently launched a second fund, of $66.7 million,
following the first $43 million fund. Four investments have already
been made from the new pot. Shanahan said it took only an
hour-and-a-half meeting with Jack Egan to get the nod on the new
fund.
</P>
<P>
   Mind you, this isn't big money for the Egans. In its latest
survey, Boston magazine ranked the senior Egan as the 17th-richest
man in the Commonwealth, with a fortune worth $1.4 billion.
</P>
<P>
   But Shanahan contends this is more than a rich man's angel
hobby.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a very deliberate effort to create an institution with
their brand on it,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   It's also outside the realm of corporate venture capital, the
hot fad of the moment, in which big companies, including EMC
itself, make side investments in start-ups. Companies from
Microsoft and Intel to Fidelity Investments have large venture
capital businesses. And many other companies have dabbled in what
turned out to be riskier business than they had planned.
</P>
<P>
   EMC Corp. does make its own corporate venture investments, and
there is no distinct cooperation between Egan and the company.
</P>
<P>
   Dave Barry, senior editor of the Corporate Venture Capital
Report, says that could cause controversy. For example, Dell
Computer's venture arm gets a shot at investing in companies that
Michael Dell's venture group, MSD, backs.
</P>
<P>
   ``If shareholders of Dell were to find out that Michael Dell
invested in a company, and (Dell) itself didn't get a chance to
look at those deals, investors might be upset,'' Barry said.
</P>
<P>
   That's if the investment turned out to be a good one, of course.
Investors would surely bark, too, if the company followed the
founder's personal investments and lost money.
</P>
<P>
   The focus of the Egan funds is information technology and
business-to-business players. The goal, Shanahan says, is to make
investments of $2 million to $4 million in 12 to 15 companies over
the next year.
</P>
<P>
   These are good times in venture capital, Shanahan says. As the
years go on, it will be tougher to impress the Egans, holders of
one of the best stocks of the past decade, with a rise of more than
75,000 percent.
</P>
<P>
   ``I check EMC's stock price every time we're on the phone, to
know how Jack's feeling,'' Shanahan said.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
----- &QC; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   This will doubtless go down as the year in which venture capital
made a mint for Harvard University's massive endowment fund.
</P>
<P>
   The private equity portion of the $19.2 billion endowment
provided a 155 percent return for the 12 months ended June 30, said
Harvard Management Co. The overall return was 32.2 percent, thanks
largely to help from the venture returns. The total fund's return
marked the send-best showing since 1974, when Harvard Management
was started. In 1983, the return was 43.6 percent.

CHINESE DIVER XIONG NI REPEATS GOLD MEDAL PERFORMANCE 
</HEADLINE>
   By BILL BRINK    
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   SYDNEY, Australia _ For five rounds of diving, Xiong Ni had
watched Dimitri Sautin whirl through the air in tightly wrapped
spins and somersaults, building a lead that neither Xiong nor
Sautin's 10 other rivals appeared ready to match. Xiong had come
out of retirement specifically to help the Chinese team counter
Sautin's pre-eminence, and now he was waiting and hoping for the
Russian to give him an opening in the 3-meter springboard final.
</P>
<P>
   Fortunately for Xiong, Sautin saved his hardest dive for last,
but not his best one. His slip-up enabled Xiong to surpass him and
claim the gold at the Olympic Park Aquatic Center Tuesday night.
Sautin dropped to third behind Mexico's Fernando Platas, who
finished 0.3 points behind Xiong.
</P>
<P>
   Xiong, 26, became only the second diver to win medals at four
Olympics _ Italy's Klaus Dibiasi was the other, from 1964 through
1976 _ and he repeated his springboard victory from the 1996
Atlanta Games. Xiong also won a bronze in the platform in 1992 and
a silver in the platform at the 1988 Games in Seoul.
</P>
<P>
   ``Only when the points came up did I believe that I was the
champion,'' said Xiong, who came out of retirement two years ago at
the urging of Chinese sports officials. ``This is the best, most
valuable reward for the hard work and sweat of the last few
years.''
</P>
<P>
   Two American divers, Troy Dumais and Mark Ruiz, finished sixth
and seventh, respectively. Dumais lost his chance when he gambled
and changed his third dive, increasing the degree of difficulty
from 3.0 to 3.5. His form was off, and he was effectively
eliminated with a low score of 49.50. Ruiz, whose specialty is the
platform, was never in serious contention in the final round.
</P>
<P>
   No one seemed to be a serious contender to Sautin for most of
the night. Xiong was more than 30 points behind after two rounds,
and the way Sautin was diving there seemed little chance that Xiong
would catch him. Platas was staying close with a series of
somersaults in the pike position, but Xiong moved past him into
second on the fifth dive with a beautiful reverse 1{ somersault
with 3{ twists. With one dive to go, Sautin led Xiong by just under
11 points, and Platas by just over 13 points.
</P>
<P>
   Platas, Sautin and Xiong were the final three divers, and the
Mexican turned in his best dive of the night. Sautin faced his
toughest dive of the night, a reverse 2{ somersault with 1{ twists,
and failed to execute it. He received his lowest score of the
night, and fell below Platas.
</P>
<P>
   Xiong finally had his opening, and he seized the opportunity.
Knowing he was 81.30 points behind Platas, he executed a
near-perfect inward 3{ somersault and watched as the scoreboard
registered marks of 7.5 to 8.0 for an 81.60. Xiong pumped his fists
and joyfully hugged his coaches.
</P>
<P>
   Afterward, Sautin acknowledged that he might have erred in
putting his most difficult dive at the end. ``I led from the
beginning to the final dive,'' Sautin said afterward, ``so it is
very disappointing to lose. My last dive is the most difficult in
my program, so maybe it was a mistake to include it.'' &QL;

WHO STOLE MY INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY? 
</HEADLINE>
 TAKES-BOS   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By PATTI HARTIGAN  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   At the beginning of the summer, a copy of an unreleased single
from Madonna's upcoming album ``Music'' found its way onto Napster,
the popular file-swapping service. Needless to say, the Material
Girl was not amused.
</P>
<P>
   And she was not alone. As the summer wore on, illicit copies of
other forms of entertainment appeared all over the Internet.
Bootleg versions of such movie blockbusters as ``Gladiator'' and
``Me, Myself, and Irene'' popped up on networks like Scour Exchange
and Gnutella shortly after their release in theaters. And the
hottest book of the season, ``Harry Potter and the Goblet of
Fire,'' was traded illegally online within hours after it hit the
stores.
</P>
<P>
   Clearly, file sharing isn't just for music anymore. Virtually
anything that can be reduced to digital bits is becoming a
commodity, and the entertainment and publishing industries are
grappling with ways to protect copyrighted material at a time when
the very notion of intellectual property is being challenged. Even
the needlepoint industry is running scared: Ladies who stitch
samplers are trading patterns online, and one pattern publisher,
South Carolina-based Pegasus Originals, has reported a 40 percent
drop in revenue since 1997.
</P>
<P>
   Tension is building between the old economy copyright owners _
the record labels, movie studios, and publishing houses _ and the
new economy entrepreneurs who are constantly inventing new ways to
distribute content. Meanwhile, consumers are rapidly embracing the
new technology even as the entertainment industry is frantically
trying to curtail its spread.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is a turf war going on over the hearts and minds of
consumers and the way they use content,'' says Eric Sheirer, media
and entertainment analyst for Forrester Research. ``The content
industry and the technology industry are battling it out, and they
really can't both win. Their interests are not aligned.''
</P>
<P>
   So far, the content industry appears to be winning _ at least in
the courts. Two weeks ago, a federal judge ruled that MP3.com
violated the copyrights of Universal Music Group by offering its
CDs for play over the Internet and ordered potentially crippling
damages that could hit $250 million. Last month, the Motion Picture
Industry Association of America scored a victory when a federal
judge ruled that it is illegal to publish DeCSS, a program used to
crack antipiracy features on DVDs. And in July, a federal judge in
San Francisco issued an injunction to shut down the wildly popular
Napster service; the order is on hold pending appeal, and the case
returns to the courts next month.
</P>
<P>
   But despite the court rulings, the concept of file-sharing is
becoming ingrained in the public consciousness. Users, particularly
college students and young professionals, are growing accustomed to
easy access to music sampling services, and litigation only seems
to increase Napster's hold on the popular imagination. For
instance, traffic to Napster.com surged the week after the court
ruling, according to Media Metrix, the New York-based market
research firm that measures Internet usage. And in July, Napster
hit Media Metrix's list of the top 50 US digital media and Web
properties; the service currently claims to have more than 20
million users.
</P>
<P>
   So can tens of millions of people be wrong? ``You can't impose a
law that is not morally upheld by the vast majority of people,''
says Internet activist John Perry Barlow, cofounder of the
Electronic Freedom Foundation. ``And you can't impose a standard
that can be broken _ and just about all of them can.''
</P>
<P>
   This isn't just an economic battle between those who hold that
information should be free and those who claim they ought to be
paid for content. There are enormous cultural implications to the
debate as well. There is nothing new about file sharing; early
adopters have been sharing digital photographs (albeit, mostly
pornography) and text files since the early days of bulletin board
services. But now that file sharing has become mainstream, the
technology creates enormous potential for previously unheard voices
to reach the masses.
</P>
<P>
   Unsigned record artists, independent filmmakers, and unknown
novelists are all using the Internet to get their products seen and
heard by the public, creating new niche markets and forging offbeat
cultural communities.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are huge cultural advantages to allowing or facilitating
Internet distribution of these materials,'' says Harvard Law School
professor William Fisher. ``It expands the set of authors who can
reach the media and reduces the grip on popular culture by a small
number of dominant American companies. It would be a tragedy if the
opportunity for the communication of these materials were lost
because of excessive protectionism.''
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, though, artists must have some incentive to
create their work in the first place. ``Unless we can come up with
alternative arrangements for compensating creators, those
incentives will be eroded, and we'll be throwing out the baby with
the bath water,'' Fisher adds. ``And that is an equal tragedy.''
</P>
<P>
   Therein lies the dilemma. How do you encourage the cultural
diversification made possible by the Internet while also ensuring
that artists get paid for their work? Some in the entertainment
industry insist that the immediate solution lies in the courts.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are going to make it very clear that stealing is wrong, and
we will not hesitate to go to the courts,'' says Jack Valenti,
president of the Motion Picture Association, which is suing
Scour.com, the company that runs a popular multimedia search engine
and file-swapping service.
</P>
<P>
   But most legal scholars _ and a growing number of executives in
the entertainment industry _ contend that the lawsuits are a waste
of time and money.
</P>
<P>
   ``Notwithstanding the large verdict against MP3.com, lawsuits
aren't a very good way to make money,'' says Mark Lemley, a
professor of intellectual property law at the University of
California at Berkeley law school. ``If we are going to get a
solution, it is going to come from the content industry being
willing to make the leap into online distribution.''
</P>
<P>
   Of course, the content companies have claimed all along that
they plan to come out with systems that enable consumers to
purchase and hear music online.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't see litigation as the be-all and the end-all,'' says
Hilary Rosen, president and CEO of the Recording Industry
Association of America, the umbrella group representing the music
industry in the cases against Napster, MP3.com, and Scour. ``I see
it as an important tool in sending a message to venture capitalists
that the way to support innovation is to respect the creative
interests. But I am also very clear that the music business has to
evolve, and it is in everybody's interest to create a legitimate
online music business.''
</P>
<P>
   But the music industry, in particular, tends to move with the
speed of an oil tanker negotiating a narrow inlet. And so far, its
online efforts have been less than spectacular. EMI, Sony, and
Universal Music Group recently entered the digital download
business, offering a limited number of albums for sale online. But
consumers used to the ease of Napster haven't exactly raced to
check out these offerings, and the few consumers who have tried to
buy digital music from the major labels have experienced technical
difficulties.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is no question that there have been growing pains, and
some initial starts have been awkward,'' concedes Rosen. ``Everyone
is doing the best they can, and there is a will and a path and a
huge amount of investment going into doing this.''
</P>
<P>
   In addition to the technical problems, the music industry has
suffered a backlash since it took on Napster and other file-sharing
services. After the heavy metal band Metallica sued Napster, its
own fans ridiculed the band and its leader, drummer Lars Ulrich,
posting parodies of the band online and vowing to boycott their
albums.
</P>
<P>
   As a result, the book industry wants to learn from the music
industry's mistakes and avoid a public relations embarrassment. As
a group, the book publishers haven't been as aggressive in taking
their case to the courts, for a number of reasons. The book
audience is older than the popular music audience, and piracy is
not as prevalent _ yet. Likewise, electronic reading devices are
still a novelty embraced primarily by early adopters.
</P>
<P>
   But that doesn't mean the book industry is sitting back idly.
``We are watching the litigation very closely,'' says Allan Adler,
vice president of legal and government affairs for the Association
of American Publishers. Last month, the association launched an
anti-piracy Web site and announced a strategy to promote legal,
protected books for sale online.
</P>
<P>
   But at least one author, science fiction writer Harlan Ellison,
says the industry isn't doing enough to ward off piracy. His books
and stories are routinely traded online, and he has sued individual
Web site operators as well as Internet service providers, including
America Online, that he claims facilitate piracy. He won a case
against an individual pirate, but he has been unsuccessful so far
battling the big ISPs in the courts. Ellison sees a sense of
urgency in dealing with the problem and has one word to describe
publishers who have yet to take legal action: ``Dinosaurs.''

 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Send.com mastered the dot-com business formula last year: Throw
thousands of products onto a Web site, spend millions of dollars on
prime-time television commercials, and then pray.
</P>
<P>
   Now, in a change typical of the survivors of this year's dot-com
bloodbath, the company is acting more like a real merchant _
cautious about spending, savvier about consumer behavior, and
nervous as hell about the holiday selling season.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of what you saw in the last few years of e-tailing was
driven by a technology perspective rather than a consumer
perspective,'' said Michael Lannon, chief executive of Send.com, a
Waltham, Mass. online seller of gifts. ``You can't be a technology
company that sells stuff.''
</P>
<P>
   Only two years ago, Lannon's holiday preparations would have
appalled any traditional merchant. That's when Lannon began ramping
up for the Christmas bonanza in the fall. He has since learned that
planning for the following season should start, well, right after
Christmas. And like a true retail executive, he now starts
panicking in September rather than December.
</P>
<P>
   ``When Labor Day ended, it was like, `Summer's over. My life is
over,' '' Lannon said.
</P>
<P>
   In February, Lannon and other Send.com executives got an early
start on mapping their holiday strategies. They decided to slash
advertising spending, revamp their Web site, and offer a smarter
selection of gifts. Hiring for the company's customer call center
began in September, a few weeks earlier than usual.
</P>
<P>
   Send.com, a closely held company known for its advertisements
featuring ``The Giver,'' is actually the third version of a company
that Lannon started three years ago. Initially, he started selling
bottles of wine by phone, using merchants across the nation to
package and deliver the orders.
</P>
<P>
   But Lannon's first Web site, Sendwine.com, won over customers.
In October 1999, the company became Send.com, reflecting its much
larger offering: cigars and champagne as well as gift certificates
for fine dining, spas, and exotic car rentals.
</P>
<P>
   Today, the company's annual sales are growing 10-fold, and the
business has an enviable return rate of less than 1 percent.
Hundreds of merchants have signed on as partners, with 90 percent
expected to be using Send.com's MerchantLink order-management
software by year's end.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're making the Web practical for the merchants,'' said Mary
Obana, the company's marketing director. ``Most of them don't have
the expertise or a Web site. We provide them with a simple solution
to allow them to go on the Internet.''
</P>
<P>
   Bringing smaller retailers onto the Web initially took more
hand-holding.
</P>
<P>
   ``They were a bit scared,'' said Steve Marchlik, who manages
MerchantLink for Send.com. ``They picked up a mouse . . . and were
like, `What is it?' ''
</P>
<P>
   But the merchants have become more sophisticated. Today, even
retailers with Web sites has signed on, viewing Send.com as a way
to broaden their appeal. For example, Tealuxe Inc., A Franklin,
Mass. company that runs tea bars and its own Web site, wants to use
Send.com to attract corporate gift givers as well as tea lovers.
</P>
<P>
   ``It wasn't competing with our Web site,'' said Diana Rodgers,
marketing director for Tealuxe. ``Most of our customers are from
our stores, and our Web site is a convenience for them.''
</P>
<P>
   In spite of the growth in Send.com's sales and merchant
partnerships, these are leaner times for virtual retailers. Today,
Send.com executives are under pressure to deliver profits, which
they plan to do in the fourth quarter of 2001.
</P>
<P>
   But they are well aware of what can happen when investors lose
their patience. In the last year, investors have pulled their
support from such Internet merchants as Boo.com, Toysmart.com, and
Craftshop.com.
</P>
<P>
   The hostility has spread to suppliers, advertising agencies, and
even landlords. In the spring, Send.com had hoped to move to larger
offices in Waltham. But after a commercial real estate agent
demanded a special ``dot-com'' security deposit of $1 million,
company executives abandoned their search and decided to spend
$50,000 renovating their headquarters.
</P>
<P>
   Mindful of the backlash, Send.com executives are wielding the
budget ax. Last year, the Internet retailer spent a staggering $13
million on TV commercials to raise awareness for its brand. For
this holiday season, ``there will be no TV,'' Lannon said.
</P>
<P>
   The compay will instead target customers through less expensive
e-mail, regular mail, and radio promotions. Send.com's gifts also
will be displayed on CNBC.com and other sites that attract a busy
clientele.
</P>
<P>
   Executives have sought other cost-trimming opportunities. They
have cut $100,000 in photography fees by doing the work in-house,
for one.
</P>
<P>
   Next month, Send.com is set to debut a new site design that will
help the company quickly update its Web pages, moving slow sellers
and products with low inventory to the bottom of the pages. The new
functionality was needed as the company began offering more
products.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were collapsing under the weight of our product
selection,'' Lannon said.
</P>
<P>
   Send.com also will tweak its Web pages to reflect consumer
behavior. The company has learned that lost customers log off, so
it will add navigational tools, a search box, and product
categories on every page.
</P>
<P>
   Executives also have learned that online shoppers only buy what
you show them. That means more pictures, less chatty text, and
better use of the site's prime real estate.
</P>
<P>
   Customers rarely scroll down, the company discovered, so
displaying products at the bottom of a Web page is like storing
them at the top of an 11-foot shelf in the rear of a store.
</P>
<P>
   ``People are very visual, and we were making them read too
much,'' Obana said.
</P>
<P>
   Insights into consumer behavior are crucial for Internet
retailers. For instance, Send.com now knows that men don't buy men
golf lessons. (It's considered an insult to the male ego, Send.com
officials say.) The company also has realized that it needs to
prepare for two order surges for Valentine's Day.
</P>
<P>
   ``Valentine's Day was a two-week holiday for us this year,''
Obana said. ``The week before Valentine's Day, women were buying
gifts for men. The week of Valentine's Day, men were looking for
gifts.''
</P>
<P>
   Customers also have informed Send.com that they want more
products under $50 and a wider variety of gift suggestions. In
response, the company has added a collection of teas and tea sets.
Its holiday lineup will include steaks, hams, fresh-baked cookies,
and wide array of gift baskets.
</P>
<P>
   ``You have to keep updating,'' Obana said. ``Customers don't
want to give people the same thing again and again.''

DISHING THE NET 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By PETER J. HOWE  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   If you're in the market for Internet access faster than a
dial-up modem but are cursed to live somewhere with neither cable
modems nor digital subscriber line telephone access, you still have
hope: Net links through satellite dishes.
</P>
<P>
   The bad news is that, for now, the main broadband-for-computers
service, Hughes' DirecPC product, costs more and delivers less than
AT&AMP;T Broadband, RCN, or the various DSL offerings from Verizon,
FlashCom, and others.
</P>
<P>
   The good news is that later this year, perhaps as soon as next
month, both DirecPC and the Dish Network plan to offer much faster,
two-way satellite broadband services. They will probably still cost
more than landline alternatives but deliver faster access than
satellite systems do now, especially for sending information out to
the Net.
</P>
<P>
   For now, DirecPC, the dominant offering in the computer Net
market (leaving aside WebTV, which provides Internet access through
your TV set and a keyboard), can give you download speeds about
eight times faster than a dial-up modem.
</P>
<P>
   Installation charges are often waived during promotions, but
generally it costs $150 to get the dish, or $200 for a ``DirecDuo''
dish that brings in both the Internet and hundreds of channels of
television.
</P>
<P>
   For $30 a month, with DirecPC you can surf the Web for 25 hours
a month, paying $2 for every extra hour, or under a new unlimited
access plan pay $50 a month. Those charges include $10 for an
Internet service provider.
</P>
<P>
   If you live somewhere you can get DSL or a cable modem but don't
plan on using the Net more than an hour a day for the next two
years, factoring in monthly charges plus the one-time dish cost,
you might come out ahead taking the 25-hour plan.
</P>
<P>
   But many analysts note that, once you've had a taste of
always-on, high-speed Internet access, you are very likely to make
using the Net a much bigger part of your life and entertainment and
might find it hard to limit yourself to 25 hours a month.
</P>
<P>
   The DirecPC service is not quite true broadband because it uses
a dial-up modem to transmit information from your computer _ such
as a request to load the Boston.com Web page _ and then blasts the
contents of the page back down to your computer through a satellite
dish on the side of your home at up to 400 kilobits per second.
</P>
<P>
   It's a little like mailing a postcard out to someone and getting
an overnight package sent back. And the satellite is not aiming
content to your address, but rather including it in a huge stream
of thousands of transmissions, encoded so that you receive only the
Web page you asked to get.
</P>
<P>
   While noticeably faster than a dial-up modem, DirecPC, at 400
kilobits, is still considerably slower than the
640-kilobit-per-second service offered by Verizon DSL or the 1.5
megabit connections of AT&AMP;T Broadband. Verizon and AT&AMP;T's
RoadRunner generally cost about $40 a month, and more for faster
DSL. Installation and modem fees may run to $100 but are often
waived during promotions or through coupons.
</P>
<P>
   ``It seems expensive for a consumer in the Boston area relative
to a cable modem or a DSL hookup, but in a lot of rural areas it's
going to be the only way'' to get broadband services, said John
Galego, director of service provider relations with
GetConnected.com. The site is a Boston service that offers unbiased
comparison shopping for Internet access and other communications
and energy services.
</P>
<P>
   Even in Massachusetts, which is blessed to have some of the
widest-ranging cable modem and DSL offerings of any state, there
are still many broadband gaps _ either towns where the cable
franchise has not been upgraded for Internet access, or areas of
cities and towns more than about two and a half miles from a
``central office'' equipped for DSL service.
</P>
<P>
   While satellite Internet access can be a good choice for someone
whose only alternative is pokey dial-up access, Galego said that
``one of the biggest considerations for satellite access'' is
decidely low-tech: your neighborhood geography.
</P>
<P>
   Specifically, to get DirecPC reception you have to be able to
get a clear view to the southwest sky from some part of your home
or property where you are willing to install a dish, with no trees
or other homes in the way.
</P>
<P>
   People often wonder whether satellite reception will suffer
during heavy rain or snowstorms _ or when a flock of geese flies by
_ but Galego said in his experience service outage problems are
``negligible'' for satellites compared to cable or DSL.
</P>
<P>
   DirecPC also requires a fairly powerful Pentium-chip computer to
function, running Windows 98 and containing at least 32 megabytes
of RAM memory and 20 megabytes of space on the hard disc for the
DirecPC software.
</P>
<P>
   Both DirecPC and Echostar have been pouring money into rolling
out new two-way satellite Internet services they plan to unveil
this fall, and even more offerings are expected in the next three
years, such as iSky and Astrolink.
</P>
<P>
   Working with an Israeli company called Gilat-to-Home, EchoStar's
Dish Network plans a two-way broadband satellite offering that
could go live as soon as next month in some parts of the United
States.
</P>
<P>
   Pricing and performance are still a little fuzzy, however.
EchoStar and Gilat-to-Home say users ``can expect Internet access
speeds up to 10 times faster than normal modem speeds, with burst
rates considerably higher.'' Bursting refers to one-time downloads
of big files such as songs or video clips.
</P>
<P>
   EchoStar plans to use an oval-shaped dish, about two feet by
three feet in size, that can bring in both Internet access and the
500 channels of the Dish Network.
</P>
<P>
   DirecPC also says it will launch a two-way broadband service
sometime this fall, still offering about 400 kilobits downstream
but allowing somewhere between 128 and 256 kilobits upstream. To
make it work, you will need to install a transmitter in the USB
port of your computer.
</P>
<P>
   For businesses, DirecPC also offers a service allowing them to
blast out content to multiple locations without getting hung up in
bottlenecks. For less than $100, for example, a company could
transmit a 30-mb file to 10,000 personal computers across the
country in less than two minutes.
</P>
<P>
   One user of this service is RLM Software of Brighton, Mass.,
which pumps up-to-the-minute data on airline flight arrival times
to customers across the country such as shipping companies. It also
provides much of the data used by Travelocity.com's flight status
service, through a direct link to Federal Aviation Administration
radar data showing the actual location of thousands of airplanes,
which is used to calculate expected arrival times.
</P>
<P>
   Mary Flynn, a senior executive with 20-person RLM, said the
company decided to use DirecPC for its FlightView service because
``all our customers don't necessarily have access to a high-speed
Internet connection.''
</P>
<P>
   The company also determined that using satellites to steer clear
of the Internet would prevent lots of headaches trying to determine
the cause when customers reported they were not receiving data.
</P>
<P>
   ``If there's an outage on the Internet, and that still happens a
lot, you have to go track it down,'' Flynn said. After some early
rocky going, Flynn said, ``They have made improvements in the last
18 months. The reliability is there now.''

COMPUTER CHIP COULD KEEP YOUR LAPTOP SAFE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By ROSS KERBER  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   W. David Lee has a solution to a rash of laptop thefts: a car
alarm for your PC.
</P>
<P>
   He means it literally. A device he hopes to sell to computer
makers is based around a motion-detection chip made by Analog
Devices of Canton, Mass. The chip is already widely used in car
alarms and airbags.
</P>
<P>
   Now Lee, a former consultant for Analog, hopes to take the
device a step further with his own company, Caveo Technology LLC in
Cambridge.
</P>
<P>
   He says he is in talks with several makers of laptop computers
to provide alarm systems for their models that would appear next
spring.
</P>
<P>
   Lee's vision includes a flat device measuring 30 milimeters
square containing the Analog chip, a speaker, and its own battery.
The system would be built directly into laptops or other electronic
devices, and would include software to prevent the machine from
booting up without the correct passwords.
</P>
<P>
   ``It just became obvious to me that something was needed to make
these more secure,'' says Lee, who as Caveo's chief executive and
largest shareholder oversees seven employees.
</P>
<P>
   Caveo is hardly alone in the market for laptop security, a topic
of much interest as increasing volumes of data are kept only in
electronic bits rather than on paper.
</P>
<P>
   Just last week, for instance, an IBM laptop belonging to Irwin
Jacobs, chief executive of wireless-chip maker Qualcomm Inc., was
missing from a hotel conference room moments after he addressed a
conference of business writers in California.
</P>
<P>
   To solve the problem of laptop theft, some competitors sell
software that tracks a computer's whereabouts on the Internet, or
heavy cable locks customized to bolt onto PCs. Kryptonite Corp. of
Canton makes its own motion-detection alarm for laptops, which
costs $60 and provides users with a docking station and a 110-db
alarm.
</P>
<P>
   Lee says his solution will be more subtle, combining two of his
previous roles.
</P>
<P>
   As former board member of Kryptonite, Lee helped oversee the
development of computer-security products. And, as a consultant for
Arthur D. Little, Lee was involved in the production of a
motion-sensor chip at Analog, in Norwood.
</P>
<P>
   According to the company, the most recent version of the chip,
known as the ADXL202E, contains as its prime feature a polysilicon
structure suspended above a silicon wafer with tiny springs also
made from polysilicon. The suspended mass weighs just 0.7
micrograms. A movement, or acceleration, of the chip can then be
determined by measuring the electrical signals generated by the
displacement of the suspended structure.
</P>
<P>
   Analog began producing such chips in 1991 and, in addition to
automotive-component makers, currently sells many to Microsoft,
Sony, Nintendo, and other producers of gear for computer games.
</P>
<P>
   Christophe Lemaire, a marketing manager for the company, said it
is also in discussions with makers of cell phones and
personal-digital assistants to provide what he calls ``gesture
recognition.'' Imagine, he said, a cell phone that could be hung up
with a jiggle, or one that could shaken just so to dial a
particular phone number.
</P>
<P>
   More immediately, Analog and Caveo have developed what Lee calls
a ``motion-algorithm library,'' so that an installed chip and its
software will be able to tell when a host laptop is just being
pushed around a desk, or when it is being carried on the run.
</P>
<P>
   Gail Caldwell, a Caveo vice president, said the alarm can be set
to go off when the laptop is carried beyond, for example, a 10-foot
perimeter from its original placement.
</P>
<P>
   Prices haven't been set, but Caldwell said the company expects
to sell its systems to laptop makers at around $20 each.

   PODOLSK, Russia _ Forget Marat Safin.
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. Open tennis champion from Russia may yet prove a flash
in the pan. Forget, too, president and judo expert Vladimir Putin.
Smirking about last month's sinking of the nuclear submarine Kursk
with 118 sailors aboard during a recent CNN interview isn't likely
to improve his stature.
</P>
<P>
   No, for a country desperate to restore its former greatness and
grasping for a unifying symbol, Olympic wrestler Aleksandr Karelin
_ a.k.a. ``The Experiment'' _ is the closest thing Russia has to a
national hero.
</P>
<P>
   Entering Wednesday's medal round at the Sydney Olympics, the
32-year-old Karelin boasts one of the most astounding records in
international sports competition: 12 European championships, nine
world championships and three Olympic gold medals. The 285-pound,
6-foot-four-inch superheavyweight from Siberia has not lost a match
since 1987.
</P>
<P>
   He is the unquestioned favorite to win in the 130-kilogram
(286-pound) superheavyweight division, as he always is.
</P>
<P>
   With roots still deep in rural Russia, Karelin provides a rare
glimmer of pride in a nation that even now, almost 10 years after
the fall of communism, can't agree on words for its national anthem
and whose economy barely outranks Belgium's.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's a bear. He's unbeatable. And he's ours,'' says Anatoly
Manedov, a 55-year-old cab driver in Moscow.
</P>
<P>
   Probably no one's shoulders are broad enough to bear the burden
of Russia's pent-up aspirations. Yet Karelin, whose boyhood
ambition was to become a truck driver like his father, may come as
close as anyone.
</P>
<P>
   Start with his physique. No, chuckled Karelin during a recent
pre-Olympic tournament south of Moscow, he wasn't created in a mad
scientist's laboratory. Still, the tax policeman and member of
Russian Parliament easily could be mistaken for a menacing giant.
</P>
<P>
   His cauliflowered ears flair from his shaven head like bent
wings. His jutting brow topples into eye sockets hollowed by months
of three-a-day practices. His face, like a battered catcher's mitt,
is furrowed by years of encounters with flying elbows, gouging
fingers and the polyurethane wrestling mat.
</P>
<P>
   Yet what's remarkable about Karelin is not his shoulders that
slope like the sides of a mountain or his chest that spreads like a
river delta. It's his hulking hands, which resemble in thickness
and length the steel claws of an earth-mover. With those hands, he
once lifted a refrigerator twice his size and carried it up eight
floors to his apartment. Human opponents fare worse.
</P>
<P>
   ``I grew up in Wyoming and wrestled with cows. When Karelin
grabs you, it's kind of the same thing,'' says Rulon Gardner, the
U.S. Olympic team's superheavyweight and a top challenger for the
gold medal. ``He basically grabs you the way he wants.''
</P>
<P>
   Upper-body strength is key in Greco-Roman wrestling, which bars
moves below the waist, and Karelin sports a trademark move that
matches his power with the nimbleness of a far lighter wrestler.
Benignly called the ``reverse body lift,'' it is anything but
friendly: He grips his arms around the waist of his 286-plus pound
opponent, hoists him off the ground and hurls him over his head.
</P>
<P>
   Karelin is not the move's only practitioner, but in a weight
class where fat is usually a friend and girth no enemy, he's
unique. ``It's a beautiful move,'' says Karelin, who likens a
wrestling match to a four-line couplet of poetry.
</P>
<P>
   Not surprisingly, the move's beauty _ much less the rhyme _ are
lost on Karelin's foes. Alexey Kolesnikov, the No. 3
superheavyweight on the Russian team who has sparred with Karelin
in practice for eight years, says every bout with Karelin ``is like
the last.''
</P>
<P>
   ``They prefer to be pinned rather than wrestle him. I've seen
the fear in their eyes many times,'' says Anatoly Nazarenko, an
assistant U.S. Olympic team coach and a former Olympian and
three-time world champion from Kazakhstan.
</P>
<P>
   The fear is well-founded. Indeed, Karelin's finest moment on the
mat may have come when he wasn't even at full strength. After
rupturing a chest muscle, he won the gold medal at the '96 games in
Atlanta wrestling largely with one arm.
</P>
<P>
   Even referees are awed.
</P>
<P>
   Asked what advice he received from his colleagues before
officiating a Karelin match, Kevin Maxwell of Utica, N.Y., sounded
less like a referee than an air-traffic controller: ``Just stand
back and get out of the way.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Comic book stuff,'' huffs Karelin when the subject of his
fear-stricken opponents comes up. He dismisses as fluff the
suggestion he's a shoo-in to win the gold medal.
</P>
<P>
   ``My opponents are obviously very generous to me with their
predictions, but they're totally different on the mat. They are not
at all peaceful there.''
</P>
<P>
   Karelin wears his celebrity like a badly-fitted suit. He insists
he has done nothing extraordinary, shies away from adoring fans and
said he struggles not to get ``blown up like a balloon with pride''
_ self-effacing statements that only enhance his popularity
further.
</P>
<P>
   Part of Karelin's aura here stems from his enduring ties to
Siberia, not usually included in Top-10 lists of the world's garden
spots. While many Russian sports stars now live abroad _ Anna
Kournikova in Florida, Safin in Spain and swimmer Alexander Popov
in Australia _ Karelin still lives with his wife and three children
in his hometown Novosibirsk, where his upbringing was by all
accounts Lincolnesque: besides being the son of a truck driver, he
grew up chopping firewood and fetching water from an outdoor well.
</P>
<P>
   ``Karelin is humble, not like those other superstars. That makes
him unique,'' says Manedov, the cab driver.
</P>
<P>
   (EDs: Story can end here. Optional add follows.)
</P>
<P>
   Russian politics still lags behind the media slickness of its
Western counterparts, but it wasn't difficult to see Karelin was a
political consultant's dream. Putin's Unity party, needing a boost
in the polls in the run-up to last year's parliamentary elections,
recruited him to run on its slate. He and Unity won handily.
</P>
<P>
   Viktor Kuznetsov, Karelin's longtime coach, denies the wrestler
had any interest in politics before the high-level Kremlin
officials came knocking on his door.
</P>
<P>
   ``He never chased it but he couldn't refuse the offer. They just
used his name,'' says Kuznetsov, who refused to identify the
officials.
</P>
<P>
   For all his professed distaste of the limelight, Karelin has
profited from it. The vaunted Soviet sports machine, like so much
other infrastructure in Russia since communism's collapse in 1991,
is a rusty wreck that can no longer shower athletes with perks. Yet
Karelin is by all accounts well-off financially. His image adorns
fruit-juice packages, billboards and T-shirts.
</P>
<P>
   And one vestige of the machine remains: government bonuses.
While U.S. sportswear manufacturer Reebok is the Russian Olympic
team's sponsor, Putin has promised the team's athletes US$50,000
for a gold medal, US$20,000 for a silver and US$10,000 for a
bronze.
</P>
<P>
   Karelin laughs off rumors of presidential ambitions after, as
expected, his Olympic career ends in Sydney with another gold
medal. But with more success will no doubt come pressure to take on
the mantle of the Russia's frustrated dreams.
</P>
<P>
   It's not coincidental that the Russian media's latest nickname
for Karelin is the pet name of both of his political party and the
West's symbol for the once-feared Soviet Union: ``The Bear.''

<P>
   HONG KONG _ Three years ago, Leslie Kenny took her brand-new
Harvard MBA and moved to China to sell family values. When that
didn't work, she decided to sell sex.
</P>
<P>
   Not in the ``oldest profession'' kind of way. But as a hip,
no-holds-barred Dr. Ruth-meets-the-MTV-generation for a society
where sex has been a taboo subject for a good 5,000 years.
</P>
<P>
   With online polls and quizzes, Q&AMP;A's with an unflappable Chinese
MD and sexologist, uncensored bulletin boards where youths share
anxieties and advice, and ``virtual girlfriends'' for young men to
practice dating techniques, Kenny's Dotlove.com Web site and
minimagazines have brought levity and fun to sex education _ two
words that make most young Asians blush and run for cover.
</P>
<P>
   Kenny didn't set out to be a sex guru. She used to work for Walt
Disney, promoting the Disney Channel across Asia. But with limited
cash during the regional financial crisis, cable and satellite
operators were turning her away. She asked what they were buying
instead, and they told her: ``the Playboy Channel.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I realized there was an innate curiosity in Asia about sex,
and the only sources of information seemed to be pornography or
very clinical information on reproductive health from the
government,'' said Kenny, 35, who was born in California to a
Chinese mother and an Anglo-American father.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought if I wrote down everything I knew about sex . . . I
could turn a hobby into a profession,'' said Kenny, who retired
from the trendy nightclub scene when she married a British Internet
entrepreneur two years ago. ``Sex, love, and relationships _ I like
all three things, and I'm not ashamed to admit it!''
</P>
<P>
   So Kenny started an entertainment company, Dotmedia, and
launched a brand called Dotlove to promote fun and responsible sex
in a hip pop-culture format.
</P>
<P>
   Since December, she has raised $4 million in venture capital,
established an exclusive marketing partnership with Channel V, a
leading music video television channel, grown her shop from two
people to 40, and earned the title ``the high priestess of Internet
sex in China'' from a Hong Kong newspaper.
</P>
<P>
   Her next target _ and the site of her newest office _ is India,
home of the Kama Sutra, but also home to some of the most
conservative sexual mores on earth.
</P>
<P>
   One might think racy material would run afoul of the usually
controlling and strait-laced Chinese government, which routinely
blocks Web sites it considers controversial, including this
newspaper's. But instead of keeping a low profile, Kenny decided to
seek support from government-backed organizations.
</P>
<P>
   Her Hong Kong-based company cosponsored a forum on adolescent
sex education in Beijing with China's leading government newspaper,
and she hobnobbed with the country's top sex educators.
</P>
<P>
   The payoff was huge: Eager to curb unwanted pregnancies and
sexually transmitted diseases, and aware that a dry and technical
approach was turning off increasingly sophisticated youth, the
China Family Planning Association last month agreed to partner with
the American to promote sex education. The vice president of the
group, a high-ranking Communist Party member, joined Kenny's
advisory board.
</P>
<P>
   Logging onto her Chinese- and English-language Web site, it's
easy to see how Dotlove.com has captured the imagination of youth
here. The site registers 110,000 different visitors and 3 million
page hits a month _ dwarfing the reach of local youth magazines or
even the Hong Kong edition of Cosmopolitan and other magazines that
treat sex openly.
</P>
<P>
   Kenny has never advertised the year-old site in mainland China,
yet nearly half of Dotlove.com's visitors are from there. (A
quarter are from Hong Kong, 20 percent from the United States and
India, and the remaining 10 percent from Southeast Asia and
Taiwan).
</P>
<P>
   So far, the Chinese family planning group has not criticized or
tried to censor the site's frank features or its risque online
chatter. But Kenny said she will defer to her new partners if they
have suggestions for an upcoming, mainland-targeted site.
</P>
<P>
   Some of those changes may be practical ones, such as an emphasis
on birth control methods that are cheaper or more accessible than
others. But what if Dotmedia's new partners balk at the raunchy
language or discussion of ``deviant sex'' in the free-for-all
postings and chat rooms?
</P>
<P>
   ``The larger issue is to get sex education into China in a
friendly and fun way,'' said Yishane Lee, executive producer for
Dotmedia.
</P>
<P>
   The site also deals with issues surrounding homosexuality. Laws
against homosexuality were abolished in China more than 15 years
ago, but it remains a sensitive topic.
</P>
<P>
   Yet with every passing year, more taboos are broken, said Kenny,
whose grandfather taught gynecology in China.
</P>
<P>
   ``Masturbation used to be one of those issues, but attitudes
have changed,'' she said. ``People realize this can prevent
unwanted pregnancies and sexually transmitted diseases.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Chinese government is very practical _ think of the money
they can save, and the burden on millions of women that can be
avoided'' by promoting birth control instead of abortion to limit
family size.
</P>
<P>
   If Chinese family planners are practical, so are Kenny and her
team.
</P>
<P>
   The Web site, as well as the 'zine distributed free at raves,
avoid obscenity charges by using lighthearted cartoons instead of
photos. Features answer questions that every young person _ and a
lot of older people, too _ are embarrassed to ask.
</P>
<P>
   But with hip graphics, horoscopes, movie and music reviews, and
Japanese-style cartoons, it has an unabashedly youthful edge. Even
if the message is the same, this is no online version of ``The Joy
of Sex.'' It's 100 percent Generation X and younger, more Sony
Playstation than ``Our Bodies, Ourselves.''
</P>
<P>
   Kenny said she looked at ``The Joy of Sex'' when she was
researching her concept, but found the classic 1970s love manual,
with its pencil drawings and unshaven, hippie couple, to be a
``period piece.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It was so hard for me to relate to,'' she said. ``I might as
well have been watching Pilgrims make out in their buckle shoes.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Even for timeless questions like sex, the way you answer them
and package the response has to be rooted in pop culture,'' said
Kenny, who wrote the original material for the site but has turned
over content and creative duties to a staff that is even younger
and hipper than herself. They brainstorm in a corner of the office
she has decorated with plush Ikea couches, slouchy lime- and
tangerine-colored chairs, and pink and purple yoga mats.
</P>
<P>
   ``Times and cultures change, and sex changes with it,'' Kenny
said.
</P>
<P>
   As proof, even the retro arcade favorite Pac-man is getting a
face lift from Dotmedia's team. They dreamed up a game called
``Utrack'' that will soon appear on the Web site: A sperm is
released in a maze and munches hearts, representing love, on its
way to the egg at the center. Multicolored monsters representing
HIV, herpes, and chlamydia chase the sperm, and woe to the player
who doesn't pick up condoms in the maze first.
</P>
<P>
   The ``Hoochi-Koochi girlfriends'' allow viewers to try their
hand at virtual dating of cartoon characters with various
personalities. Like the electronic Tamagotchi pets that children
fed and nurtured to keep alive, a Hoochi-Koochi girlfriend rewards
or dumps her date depending on whether he treats her with respect.
(There are plans for virtual boyfriends too).
</P>
<P>
   The newest feature, launched last week, is a free matchmaking
service that allows vistors to fill out a personality profile and
find a match with a click of the mouse.
</P>
<P>
   Dotlove's team is also building a online city so matchmaking
candidates will be able to create cartoons of themselves and meet
online in a virtual cafe, karaoke bar, arcade, disco, even private
bedrooms.
</P>
<P>
   Lee, a 31-year-old Chinese-American and Brown University
graduate, said she wishes Dotlove.com had existed when she was a
teen. Like most Asians, she said, ``I was raised pretty
conservatively . . . My parents never talked about sex with me,
even though I was raised in the US.
</P>
<P>
   ``This site is so useful _ there are so many questions you have
when you're 13 and may have no one to talk to . . . And it's better
than hearing it from your friends,'' she said wryly, ``because your
friends usually don't know what they're talking about.''

   PODOLSK, Russia _ Forget Marat Safin.
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. Open tennis champion from Russia may yet prove a flash
in the pan. Forget, too, president and judo expert Vladimir Putin.
Smirking about last month's sinking of the nuclear submarine Kursk
with 118 sailors aboard during a recent CNN interview isn't likely
to improve his stature.
</P>
<P>
   No, for a country desperate to restore its former greatness and
grasping for a unifying symbol, Olympic wrestler Aleksandr Karelin
_ a.k.a. ``The Experiment'' _ is the closest thing Russia has to a
national hero.
</P>
<P>
   Entering Wednesday's medal round at the Sydney Olympics, the
32-year-old Karelin boasts one of the most astounding records in
international sports competition: 12 European championships, nine
world championships and three Olympic gold medals. The 285-pound,
6-foot-four-inch superheavyweight from Siberia has not lost a match
since 1987.
</P>
<P>
   He is the unquestioned favorite to win in the 130-kilogram
(286-pound) superheavyweight division, as he always is.
</P>
<P>
   With roots still deep in rural Russia, Karelin provides a rare
glimmer of pride in a nation that even now, almost 10 years after
the fall of communism, can't agree on words for its national anthem
and whose economy barely outranks Belgium's.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's a bear. He's unbeatable. And he's ours,'' says Anatoly
Manedov, a 55-year-old cab driver in Moscow.
</P>
<P>
   Probably no one's shoulders are broad enough to bear the burden
of Russia's pent-up aspirations. Yet Karelin, whose boyhood
ambition was to become a truck driver like his father, may come as
close as anyone.
</P>
<P>
   Start with his physique. No, chuckled Karelin during a recent
pre-Olympic tournament south of Moscow, he wasn't created in a mad
scientist's laboratory. Still, the tax policeman and member of
Russian Parliament easily could be mistaken for a menacing giant.
</P>
<P>
   His cauliflowered ears flair from his shaven head like bent
wings. His jutting brow topples into eye sockets hollowed by months
of three-a-day practices. His face, like a battered catcher's mitt,
is furrowed by years of encounters with flying elbows, gouging
fingers and the polyurethane wrestling mat.
</P>
<P>
   Yet what's remarkable about Karelin is not his shoulders that
slope like the sides of a mountain or his chest that spreads like a
river delta. It's his hulking hands, which resemble in thickness
and length the steel claws of an earth-mover. With those hands, he
once lifted a refrigerator twice his size and carried it up eight
floors to his apartment. Human opponents fare worse.
</P>
<P>
   ``I grew up in Wyoming and wrestled with cows. When Karelin
grabs you, it's kind of the same thing,'' says Rulon Gardner, the
U.S. Olympic team's superheavyweight and a top challenger for the
gold medal. ``He basically grabs you the way he wants.''
</P>
<P>
   Upper-body strength is key in Greco-Roman wrestling, which bars
moves below the waist, and Karelin sports a trademark move that
matches his power with the nimbleness of a far lighter wrestler.
Benignly called the ``reverse body lift,'' it is anything but
friendly: He grips his arms around the waist of his 286-plus pound
opponent, hoists him off the ground and hurls him over his head.
</P>
<P>
   Karelin is not the move's only practitioner, but in a weight
class where fat is usually a friend and girth no enemy, he's
unique. ``It's a beautiful move,'' says Karelin, who likens a
wrestling match to a four-line couplet of poetry.
</P>
<P>
   Not surprisingly, the move's beauty _ much less the rhyme _ are
lost on Karelin's foes. Alexey Kolesnikov, the No. 3
superheavyweight on the Russian team who has sparred with Karelin
in practice for eight years, says every bout with Karelin ``is like
the last.''
</P>
<P>
   ``They prefer to be pinned rather than wrestle him. I've seen
the fear in their eyes many times,'' says Anatoly Nazarenko, an
assistant U.S. Olympic team coach and a former Olympian and
three-time world champion from Kazakhstan.
</P>
<P>
   The fear is well-founded. Indeed, Karelin's finest moment on the
mat may have come when he wasn't even at full strength. After
rupturing a chest muscle, he won the gold medal at the '96 games in
Atlanta wrestling largely with one arm.
</P>
<P>
   Even referees are awed.
</P>
<P>
   Asked what advice he received from his colleagues before
officiating a Karelin match, Kevin Maxwell of Utica, N.Y., sounded
less like a referee than an air-traffic controller: ``Just stand
back and get out of the way.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Comic book stuff,'' huffs Karelin when the subject of his
fear-stricken opponents comes up. He dismisses as fluff the
suggestion he's a shoo-in to win the gold medal.
</P>
<P>
   ``My opponents are obviously very generous to me with their
predictions, but they're totally different on the mat. They are not
at all peaceful there.''
</P>
<P>
   Karelin wears his celebrity like a badly-fitted suit. He insists
he has done nothing extraordinary, shies away from adoring fans and
said he struggles not to get ``blown up like a balloon with pride''
_ self-effacing statements that only enhance his popularity
further.
</P>
<P>
   Part of Karelin's aura here stems from his enduring ties to
Siberia, not usually included in Top-10 lists of the world's garden
spots. While many Russian sports stars now live abroad _ Anna
Kournikova in Florida, Safin in Spain and swimmer Alexander Popov
in Australia _ Karelin still lives with his wife and three children
in his hometown Novosibirsk, where his upbringing was by all
accounts Lincolnesque: besides being the son of a truck driver, he
grew up chopping firewood and fetching water from an outdoor well.
</P>
<P>
   ``Karelin is humble, not like those other superstars. That makes
him unique,'' says Manedov, the cab driver.
</P>
<P>
   (EDs: Story can end here. Optional add follows.)
</P>
<P>
   Russian politics still lags behind the media slickness of its
Western counterparts, but it wasn't difficult to see Karelin was a
political consultant's dream. Putin's Unity party, needing a boost
in the polls in the run-up to last year's parliamentary elections,
recruited him to run on its slate. He and Unity won handily.
</P>
<P>
   Viktor Kuznetsov, Karelin's longtime coach, denies the wrestler
had any interest in politics before the high-level Kremlin
officials came knocking on his door.
</P>
<P>
   ``He never chased it but he couldn't refuse the offer. They just
used his name,'' says Kuznetsov, who refused to identify the
officials.
</P>
<P>
   For all his professed distaste of the limelight, Karelin has
profited from it. The vaunted Soviet sports machine, like so much
other infrastructure in Russia since communism's collapse in 1991,
is a rusty wreck that can no longer shower athletes with perks. Yet
Karelin is by all accounts well-off financially. His image adorns
fruit-juice packages, billboards and T-shirts.
</P>
<P>
   And one vestige of the machine remains: government bonuses.
While U.S. sportswear manufacturer Reebok is the Russian Olympic
team's sponsor, Putin has promised the team's athletes US$50,000
for a gold medal, US$20,000 for a silver and US$10,000 for a
bronze.
</P>
<P>
   Karelin laughs off rumors of presidential ambitions after, as
expected, his Olympic career ends in Sydney with another gold
medal. But with more success will no doubt come pressure to take on
the mantle of the Russia's frustrated dreams.
</P>
<P>
   It's not coincidental that the Russian media's latest nickname
for Karelin is the pet name of both of his political party and the
West's symbol for the once-feared Soviet Union: ``The Bear.''

FARMERS SECOND-GUESS RUSH TO PLANT BIOTECH CROPS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DAVID L. CHANDLER  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   To supporters, the new seeds are a revolution in the field,
yielding bigger crops that require fewer hazardous chemicals to
grow. The way biotechnology company officials tell it, the world's
best chance to feed the hungry lies in creating better seeds in the
genetics lab.
</P>
<P>
   But, to critics, the new seeds are a dangerous tampering with
nature, threatening both health and the environment. Only last
week, Kraft Foods had to recall taco shells made with a type of
genetically engineered corn that may cause allergic reactions in
some people.
</P>
<P>
   Caught in the middle are American farmers, who have rushed to
plant the biotech corn, soy and other crops in the last four years.
To many of them, genetic engineering increasingly is just a big fat
headache.
</P>
<P>
   US farms are ground zero in perhaps the biggest change in the
food supply in a generation, where technicians transfer genes from
one plant or animal to another in the quest for crops that resist
pests, survive weedkillers
</P>
<P>
   or contain extra nutrients. In just four years, with hardly a
label to let consumers know, these genetically altered crops have
found their way into vast numbers of processed foods at the grocery
store.
</P>
<P>
   Now, what seems clearest of all in the great morass of
conflicting views over the new seeds is that the farmer's
razor-thin profit margins are profoundly at risk.
</P>
<P>
   That's why, this year, farmers across the land have been voting
with their fields, cutting back on their planting of genetically
modified seeds for the first time since those seeds hit the market
in 1996. In particular, farmers planted at least 20 percent less
genetically engineered corn this year than last.
</P>
<P>
   And the trend is likely to continue. Far from dying down, the
controversies and resistance to the crops seem to be growing. Japan
_ the biggest foreign customer for US corn _ is set to join some
European nations next year in prohibiting the import of genetically
modified crops.
</P>
<P>
   Virtually everyone agrees that sensationalistic stories about
``Frankenfoods'' that might pose dire risks to people who eat them
are exaggerated _ at least in reference to any of the products now
on the market.
</P>
<P>
   But scientists also acknowledge that genetically modified foods
do have the potential to contain toxins or allergens that do not
exist in their non-engineered conterparts. That's why the US Food
and Drug Administration requires testing before introduction of
newly engineered varieties to make sure no such compounds are
present in food intended for human consumption.
</P>
<P>
   And that's where Kraft, maker of the Taco Bell brand of taco
shells, fell afoul of the rules. The shells contained traces of a
kind of engineered corn that does contain a bacteria-derived
protein not found in other kinds of corn, and that might cause
allergic reactions. For that reason, it has been approved only for
use in animal feed. But the FDA does no testing; it was only
because of testing carried out by a coalition of environmental
groups that the taco problem came to light.
</P>
<P>
   But, in truth, it isn't easy to keep the genetically altered
foods separated from the conventional ones. The operators of grain
elevators _ the huge structures that gather grain from the growers
and then ship it out by railroad or truck _ have never before had
to deal with crops that must be so vigilantly kept apart, requiring
constant dismantling and cleaning of equipment.
</P>
<P>
   And that's not the only problem. Research at Iowa State
University has shown that pollen from one crop can travel as much
as six miles on the wind. That means that a farmer producing a crop
of organic, non-engineered corn can have his whole crop
contaminated by windblown pollen from a neighbor's field of
genetically engineered corn. Some farmers have already stopped
growing the modified corn for fear of lawsuits over such
contamination.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, the biotech seed companies' relentless advocacy of
their products despite a rising global tide of resistance is
causing a growing backlash among the nation's growers.
</P>
<P>
   ``Instead of addressing the real concerns of production
agriculture,'' said Gary Goldberg, head of the American Corn
Growers Foundation, ``these industry-funded spokesmen believe it is
important to tell us what they think about these issues. The real
important question is what do foreign and domestic markets think
about'' genetically modified foods? ``After all, they are our
customers, and the customer is always right.''
</P>
<P>
   On the one hand, growers face the danger that, with strict new
rules already enacted by many of the world's corn and soybean
importing nations _ especially in Europe _ they will be unable to
find markets for their genetically modified crops.
</P>
<P>
   On the other hand, they face the grim reality that even where
markets are available and accessible, if they realize the promised
10-percent gains in yield from the biotech seeds, the bumper crop
might just drive down the already-low prices for their surplus
product.
</P>
<P>
   So, they have planted about 20 to 24 percent less (according to
different estimates) of the engineered corn this year than last,
and one corn growers' association has even been lobbying in favor
of federally-mandated labelling of genetically-modified foods.
Makers of the biotech seeds strongly oppose labelling, arguing that
their products are perfectly safe and should not be stigmatized.
</P>
<P>
   So far, the farmers' lobbying has had little effect. The
14,000-member association last spring proposed to the US Department
of Agriculture a list of 17 rules they would like to see enacted;
the agency has not replied.
</P>
<P>
   ``The USDA has been very unresponsive to any concerns,
suggestions or ideas from farmers when it comes to GMOs,'' or
genetically modified organisms, said Goldberg. ``They made a
decision up front that they would support biotechnology at all
costs, and that's what they're doing.''
</P>
<P>
   And so, Goldberg said, ``the farmer is stuck in the middle, and
doesn't know whether to support the biotechnology or not.'' The
taco recall just adds to the pressures. Dan McGuire of the American
Corn Growers Association points out that this case is likely to add
to consumer pressure for mandatory labelling of
genetically-modified foods _ something that some recent polls
indicated is already favored by 80 percent or more of the US
public. And labelling, in turn, means the need for farmers and
processors to keep the supplies separate.
</P>
<P>
   ``The increased cost for segregating GMO corn from non-GMO
varieties will add another serious level of financial stress'' to
an industry that is already hurting, McGuire said.
</P>
<P>
   Farmers, of course, are a varied and independant group, and
opinions about the new seeds are as divided in that community as in
the public at large. A rival group, the National Corn Growers
Association _ which, unlike the ACGA, does accept some funding from
the big biotech companies _ takes a more positive stand on the
technology, as does the American Soybean Association.
</P>
<P>
   Since 90 percent of the soybean crop is used for animal feed
anyway, there has been far less resistance to the
genetically-engineered versions of that crop, said Marc Curtis,
chairman of that group. Even though a higher percentage of US
soybeans are genetically engineered than any other crop, he said,
``the total volume of exports this year was a record high.'' The
controversy over genetic engineering ``may affect where exports go,
but it hasn't affected the total amount,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Still, Curtis concedes that that may change as other nations add
restrictive regulations. ``It will become more of a problem,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   Federal regulators, at this point, are not even considering
mandatory labelling. Instead, they are working on rules that would
allow products to be labelled if they do not contain genetically
modified ingredients. The agency now requires ``consultation'' by
the companies before introducing a new genetically engineered crop,
but the actual testing is up to the companies themselves. There is
no plan at this time for any requirement for independent testing.
</P>
<P>
   Similarly, long-term testing for environmental effects is not
required. Those effects are complex, and still not well understood.
Thomas Lovejoy, a specialist in environmentally sustainable
development with the Smithsonian Institution and the World Bank,
stresses that genetically modified crops do affect the environment,
``sometimes adversely, sometimes in a positive way. It's a complex
subject.''
</P>
<P>
   For example, plants that produce their own pesticides, such as
the widely planted Bt corn and soybeans, reduce the need for
pesticide spraying and therefore can reduce contamination of the
soil and water supplies. But they may lead to an uncontrolled
buildup of pesticide-resistant ``superbugs'' that require new
pesticides to kill.
</P>
<P>
   An even more serious concern is exemplified by the
widely-publicized research showing that corn that contains a gene
to produce the Bt pesticide might harm monarch butterflies, and
another that shows harm to swallowtail butterflies. While those
experiments remain controversial, the potential consequences are
far deeper than just damage to a pretty insect: by some estimates,
80 percent of all the world's food crops depend on insects,
primarily bees and butterflies, for their pollination. No bugs, no
crop.
</P>
<P>
   ``They've created something novel there: toxic pollen,'' Lovejoy
said. ``It seems almost a biological oxymoron: You don't want to
poison your pollinator.''
</P>
<P>
   Such questions, he said, ``should move way up on the research
agenda.'' But, he stressed, such concerns should not be used as a
reason to back away from the development of genetically modified
crops, which could have the potential to bring significant food
production to vast areas of the world that are too dry, too salty
or otherwise presently unsuitable for agriculture.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a mixed picture about possible effects, pro and con,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   Even the activists fighting the present proliferation of
genetically engineered crops agree on the need for active research.
Matt Rand, co-director of Genetically Engineered Food Alert, the
coalition whose testing uncovered the unapproved corn in taco
shells, emphasized that what is really needed is a lot more
testing.
</P>
<P>
   ``We need to step back for the moment,'' he said, ``and let the
science catch up to the technology.''

JOINT PAIN DRUG GAINS SCIENTIFIC ATTENTION
</HEADLINE>
  (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By LARRY TYE  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   This isn't the way medical science is supposed to work.
</P>
<P>
   A remedy used to treat creaky bones in horses and dogs works so
well that humans start taking it. It gets hyped in a best-selling
book on arthritis and the number of users skyrockets. Doctors get
glowing testimonials from patients, so they tell other patients to
try it. Finally, with about 5 million Americans taking the
concoction of crab shells and cow cartilage, enough begin asking
how it works _ and enough doctors wonder whether it really does _
that scientists finally begin studying its safety and
effectiveness.
</P>
<P>
   That's what happened with glucosamine and chondroitin, which
taken together or separately are now America's top-selling joint
supplements. The early results of research, including one study
just published and another due out soon, suggest the treatment
actually does ease joint pain and may even forestall further
cartilage damage.
</P>
<P>
   The promising research is bound to make the hard-to-pronounce
potions, which are available over the counter, even more wildly
popular.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a strange, inverted application of the traditional
scientific model,'' said Dr. Timothy McAlindon, an associate
professor of medicine at Boston University who has analyzed the
evidence on glucosamine and chondroitin sulfate, here and abroad.
</P>
<P>
   ``The science isn't black or white. We're building a case trying
to figure out if this works or not, and at the moment the evidence
is favoring these products.''
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Roland Moskowitz, a professor at Case Western Reserve
University who next week will help initiate the biggest study ever
of glucosamine and chondroitin for the National Institutes of
Health, also is bemused by the treatment's unconventional history.
But he said ``enough people are using it that if it works, we ought
to know about it. And if it doesn't, we should know it doesn't and
stop people from spending money on it.
</P>
<P>
   ``If it works, we'll have lucked out.''
</P>
<P>
   Luck has little to do with it if you ask the hordes of horsemen
and pet owners across America who have been giving their animals
the glucosamine-chondroitin pill since the early 1990s and swear
that it quickens the animals' gait and eases their agony. Ditto for
millions of people in Europe who for even longer have been using
the two compounds, which occur naturally in human cartilage and are
synthesized in the treatment capsules. The Europeans even have
scientific studies, more than three dozen of them, saying the
medicine works.
</P>
<P>
   American researchers have been slower to show an interest, which
is largely a function of the way things work here with herbal
therapies, dietary supplements and other nonpharmaceutical
products. Given the medicine's natural derivation, drug companies
find it difficult to take out patents on the products, so they have
no incentive to sponsor the expensive research to ensure they are
effective or safe. The Food and Drug Administration also steers
clear of such remedies.
</P>
<P>
   In the last couple of years, however, American researchers have
become curious. It was partly because of the publication in 1997 of
a popular book called ``The Arthritis Cure,'' and the way it
triggered an avalanche of interest in glucosamine-chondroitin among
America's 20 million sufferers of the degenerative joint disease
called osteoarthritis.
</P>
<P>
   Many were frustrated with the side effects of other medicines
and were thrilled with results they got with the new treatment.
Doctors were not about to object since their patients were so
convinced and the treatment seemed safe, although over time they
started pressing for more concrete evidence.
</P>
<P>
   McAlindon, the BU arthritis specialist, set out to see whether
all the European studies held up. His conclusion, outlined in an
article earlier this year in the Journal of the American Medical
Association, was that the overseas clinical trials do show that
glucosamine and chondroitin reduce pain in osteoarthritis sufferers
and are safe. But nearly all the European trials were supported by
manufacturers of the supplements who had the most to gain from
positive publicity. And ``in general they were not that well
done,'' McAlindon said last week. ``They seem to exaggerate the
treatments' efficacy.''
</P>
<P>
   A series of US studies is trying to weed out those quality
problems and come up with definitive answers. The largest of its
kind, published this month in the journal Osteoarthritis and
Cartilage, looked at how glucosamine-chondroitin affected pain and
movement in 93 patients with arthritic knees. ``The treatment was
significantly more effective than a placebo for pain and
function,'' said Dr. Amal Das, a joint replacement surgeon in
Hendersonville, N.C., and the lead author.
</P>
<P>
   That finding is consistent with reports from private physicians
nationwide and with the results of other, smaller studies,
including one published last year involving 34 Navy personnel
suffering from knee or lower back pain. While the effects on back
pain were unclear, that study found, the aching in knees clearly
was relieved.
</P>
<P>
   The next question everyone is asking is whether the treatment
does more than mask the pain. Does it actually cure the underlying
disease of osteoarthritis? And can it help the thousands of young
athletes with cartilage damage?
</P>
<P>
   Logic suggests it might. Glucosamine in its natural form
stimulates cells that make cartilage, while chondroitin sulfate
blocks enzymes that break down old cartilage. The question is
whether the same effects are produced by the capsules people take,
which generally get glucosamine from crab, lobster, or clam shells
and chondroitin from the cartilage in a cow's trachea. And, even
trickier, can the glucosamine and chondroitin in the pill work
their way from the stomach to the blood to the aching knee?
</P>
<P>
   Animal tests in Arizona offer hope. Cartilage was removed from
rabbits to mimic an injury of the kind humans get, and they were
fed glucosamine, chondroitin, and a combination of the two. After
several months, researchers examined the injured area. ``We found
the severity of the arthritis process was less in those given the
treatment,'' and the combination of compounds worked best, said Dr.
Robert R. Karpman, one of the researchers who oversaw the study in
Phoenix, which is due to be published next month. ``It seems to
slow the arthritic process, but it doesn't repair the joint
surface.''
</P>
<P>
   However, the Arizona study raises questions. For instance: could
humans tolerate the megadoses given to rabbits? Were the beneficial
effects a result of stopping further erosion of the cartilage or
making new proteins to replace what was gone? And can glucosamine
and chondroitin really find their way around the stomach and liver
not just to a knee or other joint, but to the particular joint that
is damaged?
</P>
<P>
   The fact that cartilage does not have blood vessels, and gets
its only nutrition by seepage through the surrounding membrane,
probably makes it easier for substances like glucosamine and
chondroitin to work their way there, said Dr. Lou Lippiello,
director of laboratory research at Nutramax Laboratories, one of
the leading manufacturers of the treatment and a partial sponsor of
the Hendersonville and Phoenix studies. ``Apparently it doesn't
affect normal joints,'' he added. ``It seems to have an affinity
for joints that are undergoing some kind of trauma or stress.''
</P>
<P>
   Further studies clearly are needed, which is why the NIH next
week is scheduled to begin a $10 million project involving 1,500
patients. It will look at glucosamine, chondroitin and the two
together to see whether they help control arthritis pain and
whether they actually attack the underlying disease.
</P>
<P>
   What should patients do in the meantime?
</P>
<P>
   Most orthopedic surgeons advise their patients to try it, under
a doctor's guidance. But it is expensive _ $1 or so a day for the
eight weeks it takes to begin working, at which point the dosage is
lowered and the cost falls to about 60 cents a day. Insurance
generally does not cover the treatment, and physicians caution
children and pregnant women not to use it. Anyone who has diabetes
or is taking the blood-thinning drug heparin also should be
careful. And researchers warn that many of the low-cost concoctions
being marketed today do not contain quality products.

`ENDURANCE`: THE BOOK, THE MOVIE, THE FLAP 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By ALEX BEAM  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Endurance, the book: I was among the thousands of readers
captivated by Caroline Alexander's 1998 bestseller, ``Endurance.''
It's better to be born lucky than talented, but Alexander was born
both. While researching an ``adult children's book'' on Mrs.
Chippy, the cat who accompanied Sir Ernest Shackleton on his doomed
1914 Antarctic expedition, Alexander struck gold: a treasure trove
of glass plate negatives taken by ship's photographer Frank Hurley.
</P>
<P>
   The story of Shackleton's 20-month, ultimately successful quest
to march, sled, row, sail, and trek his 27-man crew off the polar
ice cap is one of the most gripping survival tales of the 20th
century. Alexander curated a Hurley show at New York's Museum of
Natural History, and wrote the text for the exhibit catalog. Her
reconstruction of the oft-told Shackleton saga was so crisp that
Alfred A. Knopf published it as a book that lingered on The New
York Times bestseller list for five months.
</P>
<P>
   --Endurance, the film: Hurley was not only the Endurance
photographer; he was also the ship's cinematographer. Included in
the 60 minutes of film he shot were scenes of the dog sled races
that Shackleton organized to preserve morale during the ice-bound
winter of 1915, and of the ship's masts collapsing under the
unforgiving pressure of the pack ice. As the book gained
popularity, Alexander and her longtime beau, documentary filmmaker
George Butler (``Pumping Iron,'' ``In the Blood'') started working
on a movie.
</P>
<P>
   --Endurance, the flap: Their first investor was Paula Apsell,
executive producer of WGBH's acclaimed science series, ``Nova.''
For $600,000, ``Nova'' acquired half of the deal, which was to
include a feature film, a two-hour PBS television special, and a
jumbo-screen movie for the lucrative IMAX market. Butler,
Alexander, and their film crew began outfitting an expedition to
retrace Shackleton's Antarctic voyage.
</P>
<P>
   Then the storm struck. Butler went out and raised another $3
million from Morgan Stanley. Suddenly, ``Nova'' looked like a
minority partner _ but it had no intention of playing that role.
``Nova'' decided that it wanted Butler off the project. Lawyers got
involved. Twice, ``Nova'' tried to fire Butler from his own movie,
and twice the Directors Guild reinstated him. Don't even ask about
the 'GBH lawyers chasing Butler down to Montevideo; no one is
supposed to talk about that.
</P>
<P>
   Butler and Alexander finished working on their footage earlier
this year. Apsell wrote them a letter disparaging it, saying it
``never rose above the pedestrian.'' Nonetheless, for contractual
reasons, her name appears on the movie as executive producer. 'GBH
has some film, and $300,000, that Alexander and Butler believe is
theirs. They know they'll never see it. ``This has been long,
bloody battle,'' says Alexander, who apparently won't be sending
Christmas cards to Apsell and her producer, Susanne Simpson, this
year. ``This is a woman's story; this is estrogen-rich craziness.
These people (Apsell and Simpson) always get their way.'' A 'GBH
spokeswoman, speaking for Apsell and Simpson, says the principals
have ``differences that have unfortunately carried over into the
creative realm.''
</P>
<P>
   Where do we stand now? 'GBH now plans to make the ``Nova'' show
and the IMAX film without further input from Butler and Alexander.
Butler and Alexander have their movie, which has premiered to
enthusiastic audiences at the Telluride film festivals in Colorado
and in New Hampshire. It's a darned good movie, but it's not
perfect. Even at 94 minutes, it drags a little. And there's a hole
in the heart of the narrative: Hurley stopped filming, and stopped
taking large-format pictures, about halfway through the expedition.
The most dramatic part of the book _ the astonishing 850-mile
lifeboat voyage led by Shackleton across storm-tossed Antarctic
seas _ has to be recreated in the movie. This is one instance where
the pen is mightier than the lens.
</P>
<P>
   Butler made tons of money selling ``Pumping Iron'' into
theaters, and he's confident he can do the same with ``Endurance.''
Maybe. But the irony is that his movie is tailor-made for the
literate, historically minded public television audience. If only
we could all get along . . .

US OIL SPIGOT OPENS, AND EURO GETS A BOOST 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By THOMAS OLIPHANT  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Awash in good times, and until recently awash in
crude oil, Americans have probably forgotten how slowly their
economy recovered from stagnation and worse before it took off. But
that's what happened. What's more, Americans have also forgotten
how perilous this yellow brick road has been at times.
</P>
<P>
   But that's also what happened, and each time the wise guys got
nervous, it was because international events made them so.
</P>
<P>
   This is the context for a fascinating week of geopolitics that
linked two of the key commodities in our already linked world _
currency and crude. There has been too little demand for Europe's
new benchmark monetary unit, the euro, and too much demand for the
cartelized supply of oil.
</P>
<P>
   We already know that Bill Clinton, Al Gore, and their advisers
spent hours talking through the president's decision to release _
for contractual replenishment later _ oil from the Strategic
Petroleum Reserve in order to avert a heating oil emergency in the
looming winter, to keep prices from rising any further and maybe
nudge them down, and to hope voters in the North remember the
vigorous response in November more than they remember the
disruptions that preceded it.
</P>
<P>
   But Americans are probably less aware how much international
phone, fax, and computer traffic accompanied last week's
high-stakes move by the industrial world's giants to gamble on a
currency market intervention to halt dangerous, downside
speculation in the euro.
</P>
<P>
   The traffic was not just among industrialized powers worried
about the euro's value and the potential of ridiculous oil prices
to halt economic growth. It was also among developing countries and
the export machines in Asia, equally worried about the health of
their customers. Even reasonably responsible members of the
ultimate export machine, OPEC, share that concern.
</P>
<P>
   That is why the oil and euro moves need to be seen as linked,
because they were. For proof you need look no further than the
statements made over the weekend by the Group of Seven finance
ministers and central bankers who were hanging out in Prague for
the latest International Monetary Fund conference.
</P>
<P>
   Partisan commentary in this country is welcome to chuckle about
an alleged flip-flop (presumably for Gore's benefit) by Treasury
Secretary Larry Summers on the president's decision. But it is
interesting that no such commentary marred a move by another
statement signatory, to wit Federal Reserve Chairman Alan
Greenspan.
</P>
<P>
   The truth is that each had opposed a 60-million-barrel release
from the 570-million-barrel strategic reserve when crude oil prices
were in the mid-20s and OPEC had recently committed to moderate
production increases. But a 30-million-barrel release when the
price passed $35 and the additional oil was barely in sight was
another matter, as the weekend statements made explicit.
</P>
<P>
   The same reflection of reality also characterized their feelings
about responding to the pleas from across the pond and joining in
the intervention to prop up the euro. The United States has opposed
interventions as a general rule in recent years, but a euro testing
a value of 85 cents on its way south (its debut value was $1.17)
constituted a genuine threat to the international economy.
</P>
<P>
   In the Clinton era, that has consistently been the trigger for
action. We did it when Mexico's finances nearly collapsed and there
was brief danger of international contagion; we did it when
Russia's finances came even closer to collapse and there was even
more danger of spread; and we did it in the biggest test of all
when Asian currencies plummeted in value and many smart people were
predicting the kind of financial meltdown that would send the
United States into recession. For all those responses, the world is
still praising Clinton, Greenspan, and former Treasury secretary
Robert Rubin.
</P>
<P>
   Why should we behave any differently now, election season or no
election season?
</P>
<P>
   Europe's ability to maintain its late-starting economic recovery
was in jeopardy, and the peril was made more extreme by the spike
in oil prices, which has provoked protest on a much larger scale
than here.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the initially positive market responses to the oil and
currency moves, the near-term future makes for pointless
speculating. Those who speculate for a living, however, are again
on notice that a nearly a decade's worth of successful
industrialized world resolve is again on the table.
</P>
<P>
   By contrast, George W. Bush offers no home heating oil supply
for the inventory-depleted North and Midwest, an income tax cut
that would drive up interest rates far more than incomes, no
understanding of international codependence, indifference to
national debt reduction, and an allies-be-damned approach to
everything from Kosovo and Bosnia to missile defense.
</P>
<P>
   Call him Pat Buchanan in a three-piece suit.

THE TRUTH ABOUT FACTOID 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JAN FREEMAN  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   He was innocently amusing his readers, just punctuating his
column with some Olympic factoids, he thought. So my colleague Alex
Beam was surprised when two indignant readers let him know that as
far as they were concerned, the tidbits of information he was
handing out were facts, not factoids _ true, not false or dubious
assertions.
</P>
<P>
   So what is a factoid these days? Etymologically speaking, Beam's
readers have it right. An ovoid is something egg-shaped, but not an
egg; a humanoid resembles a human but isn't; a rhomboid is not
quite a rhombus. The Greek ending -oid means ``having the likeness
of,'' so a factoid should be a near-fact, a sort-of fact, a dubious
fact.
</P>
<P>
   That's what Norman Mailer, the apparent coiner of factoid,
intended when he used the word in 1973: Factoids, he wrote, were
``facts which have no existence before appearing in a magazine or
newspaper, creations which are not so much lies as a product to
manipulate emotion.'' He forgot to mention press releases, like the
factoidal sales pitch that just arrived by e-mail: ``Studies show
that employees are happier and more efficient when their office is
filled with personal items that reflect their personalities.''
</P>
<P>
   Dictionary makers would like factoid to go on meaning what what
Mailer said it meant, and they're doing their best. The Oxford
English Dictionary, which traces factoid from 1973 to 1992, defines
it as ``something that becomes accepted as a fact, although it is
not (or may not be) true'' and, adjectivally, as ``quasi-factual .
. . designating a a mixture of fact and supposition.'' Two
brand-new dictionaries prefer that meaning, too: Merriam-Webster's
Collegiate defines factoid as ``an invented fact believed to be
true because of its appearance in print,'' though it allows, as a
second meaning, ``a brief and usually trivial news item.''
(Incidentally, the searchable CD-ROM version of the M-W Collegiate
is an excellent source of true factoids: Searching by date, I find
that factoid debuted the same year as designated hitter, feeding
frenzy, gas guzzler, and no-brainer.)
</P>
<P>
   The fourth edition of the American Heritage Dictionary, also new
this month (and with all those little marginal illustrations in
color, for the first time) is sterner in its defense of factoid's
original meaning. Its second definition _ ``a brief, somewhat
interesting fact'' _ is labeled a Usage Problem, and followed by a
sober Usage Note explaining why facts and factoids should not be
confused. Only 43 percent of the dictionary's usage panel _ a group
that includes humorist David Sedaris and fearless flier Erica Jong,
as well as more sober consultants _ approves of using factoid to
mean a minor bit of information, we are told: ``Many Panelists
prefer such terms as statistics, trivia, useless facts, and just
plain facts.''
</P>
<P>
   But list-loving Americans _ and English-speaking journalists
around the world _ are paying them no mind. Even in the '70s,
factoid was being used as, essentially, the singular of trivia
(trivium has already turned down the job). ``They've taken her life
and turned it into factoids,'' printed in the Washington Post in
1979, was not implying that the author of the book in questions had
fictionalized it _ merely that a complex tale had been greatly
simplified.
</P>
<P>
   And nowadays, despite the intentions of Mailer and the
preferences of usage panels, factoid to mean ``little fact'' is
whomping factoid as ``factlike datum.'' Yes, you still see factoid
used to mean ``lie'' _ the Washington Times last week said that
presidential aspirant Al Gore had ``made up not just an isolated
factoid or two _ but rather a whole story about an arthritis
medication called Lodine.'' But in the year 2000, some 90 percent
of newspaper citations (there's a factoid for you) use factoid to
mean ``factlet,'' an appetizer-sized bit of information, not a
dubious or erroneous statement. So entrenched is the factual
reading of factoid that a Houston sportswriter went so far as to
call something an ``alleged factoid.''
</P>
<P>
   It seems unlikely that the dictionaries are going to win this
round; factoid really ought not to mean fact, but it does, most of
the time. H.W. Fowler called this sort of thing a Sturdy
Indefensible _ an expression that couldn't be justified but was
indisputably English, used almost universally. His S.I.'s are not
ours, but we have attendees, who, by analogy with employees and
honorees, should not be attending but attended upon; we have
shoplifters, who don't lift shops; and we have factoids, which have
assumed the status of facts, logically or not.
</P>
<P>
   Case in point: The Arizona Republic was recently taken to task
for labeling an item ``Random factoid.'' Writer Scott Craven
acknowledged that he was defying the dictionary: ``We'd like to
reassure you the facts in past `Random factoids' were true. Very
true. Extremely true,'' he wrote. ``We just like the way `factoid'
sounds.'' And so, apparently, do the rest of us.

   SYDNEY, Australia _ The search for an Olympic sport without a
doping controversy continues. On Tuesday, it led to the doorstep of
synchronized swimming, surely a haven for the weary and jaded.
</P>
<P>
   What could be safer? Hair gel doesn't make the ban list. Nor do
sequins, at least until someone discovers a way to swallow them and

</P>
<P>
   Maria Kisseleva and Olga Brusnikina won the duet gold medal with
a lovely routine. They spun and slid under the surface so smoothly
that they barely made a ripple.
</P>
<P>
   About a year ago, Kisseleva looked a whole lot chunkier than she
did in the Olympics. So she started taking a nutritional supplement
to help her lose weight. She said she got approval from the Russian
Olympic federation, which checked with the supplement manufacturer
and verified that her diet aid would pass a urine test.
</P>
<P>
   That's the story she told FINA, the governing body of aquatics
in August. Ephedrine, a banned substance, turned up in Kisseleva's
system at a meet in July, and she had to persuade FINA to shorten
the recommended suspension of three months so she could compete at
Sydney. The committee believed her explanation and let her off with
a one-month sentence.
</P>
<P>
   With that reprieve, Kisseleva came and won gold. She received
her medal on the same day that little Andreea Raducan lost hers.
The 82-pound Romanian became the first gymnast to lose a medal
because of a positive drug test.
</P>
<P>
   She had an excuse similar to Kisseleva's. She had a cold. The
team doctor gave her a pill. It turned out to contain
pseudoephedrine, a stimulant like the one in the synchro star's
test.
</P>
<P>
   Olympic officials said they felt terrible about taking Raducan's
medal, and it's no wonder. She was the all-around gymnastics
champion, the queen of Olympic glamour. Now, the two
highest-profile events in the Olympics _ all-around gymnastics and
the 100-meter dash _ have produced dethroned gold medalists.
</P>
<P>
   Taking Raducan's medal doesn't rank with the Ben Johnson scandal
of 1988, partly because the public has become understandably
cynical since then (Seoul was the Watergate of the sports world)
and partly because Raducan truly seems like an innocent victim.
</P>
<P>
   She seems very much like Rick DeMont, the American swimmer who
had to surrender his 400-meter freestyle gold medal in 1972 because
doctors told him that he could legally take asthma medication that
turned out to have illegal components. DeMont has been a
sympathetic figure ever since.
</P>
<P>
   Raducan certainly seems to have more in common with him than
humongous shot-putter C.J. Hunter or any of the weightlifters
who've been flunking drug tests as if they were advanced calculus.
</P>
<P>
   She's too small to be pharmaceutically enhanced, just as
Kisseleva appears too dainty to be on the juice. A gymnast and a
synchro swimmer? Blame the doctors, or the ridiculous scope of the
testing, which turns a cold pill into a crime.
</P>
<P>
   Except that no one is exempt. There are drugs to help every
athlete, to improve any kind of performance. Early in the Games, an
Australian newspaper published a chart of drugs, their effects and
side effects. It looked like a Wheel of Fortune game board, renamed
Drug of Choice.
</P>
<P>
   Archers and shooters look beyond reproach, right? Beta blockers,
which calm the nerves and steady the hand, can help them out. They
might improve a wayward golf game, too.
</P>
<P>
   The pixies of the gym, without discernible hips and breasts, may
look untainted. But their sport is believed to employ the most
pernicious doping tactics of all. So-called brake drugs, such as
cyproterone acetate, can retard adolescence. The absence of womanly
curves should not alleviate suspicion. It should sound alarms.
</P>
<P>
   The argument that athletes should be able to use drugs if they
wish, that their willingness to dope merely signals extraordinary
commitment, crumbles when brake drugs enter the debate. Most of the
beneficiaries are underage girls, often reared in autocratic
nations. Free will is the one thing they're not expected to
exercise.
</P>
<P>
   None of this is meant to imply that the Kisseleva and Raducan
lied about inadvertently doping. To this day, no one seriously
questions DeMont's innocence, so why challenge theirs?
</P>
<P>
   But the nutritional supplements that Kisseleva took raise
serious questions about the future of doping control. In Hunter's
defense, some have said that the steroid that appeared in his test
could have come from a legal supplement. Stanford swimming coach
Richard Quick found an adviser to recommend a supplement regimen
for his athletes, in the belief that they could achieve steroidal
effects without doping.
</P>
<P>
   Where is the line? Why are so many supplements, like the
androstendione taken by Mark McGwire during his 70-homer season,
available on the open market? And isn't it disturbing that athletic
officials went to such lengths to help a synchronized swimmer find
diet pills?
</P>
<P>
   All we really know is that no Olympic venue is safe from drug
talk. After her gold-medal performance on Tuesday, Kisseleva talked
about trying to vindicate herself, placing the blame for her brief
suspension on the manufacturer who misled her.
</P>
<P>
   So, as they ask athletes after great performances: ``What's
next, Maria?''
</P>
<P>
   She's not going to Disneyworld. She's going to court.

METROPOLITAN SHOWS OFF N.Y. CITY'S GREATNESS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JERRY MORRIS  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   What makes a great city great? The answer can be found through
Jan. 7 at New York City's Metropolitan Museum of Art.
</P>
<P>
   ``Art and the Empire City: New York, 1825-1861'' explores the
visual arts in America during this time, chronicling New York's
ascendancy to the position of the nation's primary art center and
capital of culture, a role it has claimed ever since.
</P>
<P>
   By the second quarter of the 19th century, New York City _
already the nation's financial center _ was poised to become a
``world city'' on a par with London and Paris. With the completion
of the Erie Canal in 1825, which linked the Great Lakes and the
Atlantic Ocean via the Hudson River, the great port of New York
became the gateway to the West, assuring the city's commercial
preeminence. During the next 35 years, until the outbreak of the
Civil War in 1861, New York grew rapidly, becoming the ``Empire
City'' _ the largest city in the Western Hemisphere and the
nation's center of domestic and foreign trade, culture, and the
arts.
</P>
<P>
   The exhibit includes more than 310 works, many brought together
for the first time, from around the world. Visitors will be able to
experience the moment when New York City first began to perceive
itself as the center of culture in America. Among paintings will be
the 1825-26 full-length portrait of the Marquis de Lafayette by
Samuel F.B. Morse. The portrait was commissioned in 1824 when
Lafayette, much loved in the United States for his role in the
Revolutionary War, returned for a grand national tour of the
country. While here he witnessed the opening of the Erie Canal.
</P>
<P>
   Ten galleries are filled with paintings, drawings, decorative
arts, sculpture, period jewelry (including pieces made by Tiffany
and Co. for Mary Todd Lincoln for her husband's inaugural ball),
even presentation boards from Frederick Law Olmsted on his
proposals for Central Park, which was under development in the
1850s.
</P>
<P>
   The exhibit, which is being sponsored by Fleet, is the first one
the financial institution has sponsored at the Met. As such, Fleet
is offering its customers free admission to the Metropolitan Museum
for the duration of the exhibition by showing any Fleet ATM or
debit card. During September, Fleet is also sponsoring ``Museums on
Us!,'' a program that grants Fleet customers free admission to 37
museums throughout the Northeast, including the Metropolitan and
other museums in New York.
</P>
<P>
   The museum is open daily from 9:30 a.m., except Mondays and
major holidays, to 5:30 p.m., except Fridays and Saturdays when it
is open to 9:30 p.m. Suggested admission is $10 adults, $5 students
and seniors. For more information, call 212-535-7710 or visit
www.metmuseum.org. &QL; 
 &QL; 
New map-guide &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   It's a map, it's a guide, it's handy, it's colorful, and it's
made for touring. It is a Cognoscenti Map Guide, and these ``maps''
are now available for cities such as New York, Paris, Rome, London,
and other destinations. The New York map-guide, for example, offers
the ``best list'' of restaurants, sights, hotels, nightspots,
shopping, and entertainment. Produced in Cambridge, Cognoscenti
maps not only have the information you need but are weatherproof,
use clever icons as locators, and, as the company notes, ``are the
guidebook for the new generation of travelers _ stripped down,
revved up, and ready to go.'' In addition to the maps noted,
Cognoscenti offers nine others, at $7.95 each. For information,
call 888-826-4667, fax 617-666-8685, or write to Cognoscenti, PO
Box 380700, Cambridge, MA 02238. &QL;

Finding a room &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   HOTRES.com offers a Web site that promises to find a New York
City hotel room at discounted prices even during the busiest
tourist seasons. The company says it offers more than 30 hotels,
and visitors to the site simply choose a hotel or category of
hotel, and enter the date of arrival and length of stay. HOTRES.com
then responds with pricing and alternatives. &QL; 
 &QL; 
Value of agents &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   When Premier Cruises suddenly shut down Sept. 14, passengers
aboard the Rembrandt who booked through Vantage World Travel of
Boston only had to look to a Vantage manager on board to help them
continue their vacation, which included a stay in Montreal, with
little inconvenience. Passengers on future trips were offered full
refunds and alternative vacations at discounted prices.
</P>
<P>
   On Sept. 12, just about every airline in the United States
increased the fuel surcharge from $10 one way and $20 round trip to
$20 one way and $40 round trip on most routes, increasing the price
on most ticket prices by $60 or more, including airport surcharges.
Joe Galloway, American Society of Travel Agents president, noted
that the new surcharges ``are still excluded from the base ticket
price, many consumers are unaware that the tickets they are about
to purchase will cost quite a bit more than they thought.'' At
present Alaska and Southwest airlines have not imposed additional
surcharges. Galloway said, ``In minutes, a savvy travel agent can
suggest alternate carriers and routes of travel and compare the
price of all available flights. Ultimately, you may even save
enough money by using an agent to cover the price increased by the
carriers, and then some.'' &QL;

   Canal celebration &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Union College in Schenectady, N.Y., is celebrating the 175th
anniversary of the Erie Canal with a major exhibit. The canal, once
referred to as ``Clinton's ditch'' _ a reference not to the
president but to the then New York governor DeWitt Clinton _ was a
major accomplishment for its day, with 363 miles and 83 locks,
almost entirely hand built. A merchant of the time described it as
``somewhat calculated to bewilder the senses.'' Through Oct. 29 the
college's Schenectady Museum will feature 122 items, including 31
drawings between 150 and 175 years old never before shown to the
public. &QL;

hotels. The Four Seasons Hotel Boston continues to win accolades.
The hotel has just tied for 35th place in Travel and Leisure's
``World's Best'' ranking of the Top 100 Hotels in the Continental
US and Canada. The hotel is also the only Mobil Five-Star and AAA
Five-Diamond hotel in New England. ``We are constantly striving for
perfection, and recognition of this sort is the best reminder that
our efforts do not go unnoticed,'' said Robin Brown, Four Seasons
general manager. In the magazine's Best of Boston story, the
hotel's Aujourd'hui was highly rated for its cuisine, views of the
Public Garden, and ``near-perfect'' staff.

TEXAS MARKETING ITSELF TO TOURISTS AS SHOPPERS' PARADISE
</HEADLINE>
  (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
 By SEAN WOOD 
 c.2000 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   GRAPEVINE, Texas _ Texas tourism officials are making a push to
bring shoppers to the state with a new program aimed at promoting
Texas as a shopper's paradise.
</P>
<P>
   The Shop Across Texas program, conceived by the recently formed
Texas Retail Tourism Commission, has developed a series of
brochures that it will begin distributing in two weeks.
</P>
<P>
   ``We want to catch as much of the retail tourism as we can,''
said Mark Bachus, assistant general manager of Rivercenter Mall in
San Antonio and chairman of the Texas Retail Tourism Commission.
``California, Florida, Arizona and Virginia already do this. We
need to step up to the plate and compete with them.''
</P>
<P>
   Shopping has become an increasingly popular activity for
tourists. Retail spending in Texas by all domestic and
international visitors was $5.7 billion in 1999, a 5 percent
increase over the previous year, according to the tourism division
of the Texas Department of Economic Development.
</P>
<P>
   ``Eighty-five percent of international travelers say shopping is
their preferred activity at a destination,'' Lee Wagman, president
and chief executive of TrizecHahn Development Corp. said at a
recent meeting of the International Council of Shopping Centers.
</P>
<P>
   ``Tourists are becoming more important than they have in the
past and that's something we will be focusing more on in the
future,'' said Lorie Lisius, general manager of The Parks at
Arlington mall. ``We have already been providing directories to the
local hotels and to the Arlington Convention &AMP; Visitors Bureau.''
</P>
<P>
   North East Mall in Hurst is not near a major tourist attraction
or entertainment district and has never considered itself a tourism
destination. But the mall is nearing completion of a $200 million
expansion that includes the county's only Saks Fifth Avenue and
Nordstrom department stores. And mall executives are meeting with
Fort Worth tourism officials to figure out how to market North East
Mall to tourists.
</P>
<P>
   ``Dallas has always marketed themselves as `Come to Dallas. We
have great shopping,''' said Connie Hascher, marketing director for
North East Mall. ``Saks at the Galleria draws a lot of
international shoppers who love upscale department stores. We will
be the area's largest traditional mall and we're only 10 minutes
from downtown Fort Worth and near D/FW (Airport). Grapevine Mills
already draws tourists who, after they finish shopping there, say,
`Where else can we go?' We could complement each other.''
</P>
<P>
   Bachus said that the tourism market has become a huge one for
shopping centers. ``It used to be that 10 percent of the malls went
after tourists. Now 90 percent go after them.''
</P>
<P>
   A major reason for the attraction is that tourists typically
spend more. Bachus said tourists spend three times as much as San
Antonio shoppers at Rivercenter and account for 65 percent of the
mall's sales. In response, Bachus has increased the share of his
marketing budget that is aimed at tourists from 10 percent to 70
percent.
</P>
<P>
   The Mills Corp., owner of Grapevine Mills mall, also recognizes
tourists as a major market.
</P>
<P>
   ``From the past two years until now, more and more major
developers are putting an emphasis on tourism,'' said Dennis
McGovern, general manager of Grapevine Mills. ``The emphasis that
we put on it has gotten stronger in the last five years.''
</P>
<P>
   Each of the Mills Corp.'s 10 malls has a tourism director.
Michael Glenn, tourism director at Grapevine Mills, said that 25
percent of spending at the mall is attributed to tourists and that
he makes sales missions to Europe in an attempt to increase that.
</P>
<P>
   Some visitors and convention bureaus have increasingly marketed
shopping as part of their attractions as the market has grown.
</P>
<P>
   ``One of our major draws since October of 1997 has been
Grapevine Mills mall,''said Javier Rodriguez, director of tourism
for the Grapevine Convention &AMP; Visitors Bureau. ``It's made us more
aware of the value of this industry.''
</P>
<P>
   Shopping is the main tourist activity marketed by the Irving
Convention &AMP; Visitors Bureau, said Dean Conwell, director of
tourism for the bureau. ``We're limited on our major attractions,''
he said. ``Most everything we do from a tourism standpoint is
shopping.''
</P>
<P>
   The bureau markets travel packages to Irving Mall and Grapevine
Mills mall. Conwell will meet next month with travel agents in
Mexico City to develop shopping trips to Irving.
</P>
<P>
   But Bachus said many retailers and communities have been
somewhat slow to get on the retail tourism bandwagon. Until a few
years ago, there was enough growth in the retail industry that
retailers and developers weren't looking for new markets, he said.
Now, he said, they are starting to realize the potential of
tourism.
</P>
<P>
   Doug Harman, president and chief executive of the Fort Worth
Convention &AMP; Visitors Bureau, said he has been frustrated by how
slowly the retailers in Fort Worth have responded to tourists.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm disappointed that there hasn't been more initiative,'' he
said. ``Retailers have failed to see the impact that tourism
brings.''
</P>
<P>
   Ridgmar mall in west Fort Worth has been so busy with its $70
million renovation that it hasn't done much advertising in the past
couple of years. Now, it's busy reintroducing itself to nearby
residents. But Ridgmar marketing director Jenelle Gossman said the
mall's proximity to downtown Fort Worth, itself a tourism
attraction, offers opportunities to market to tourists and
convention-goers.
</P>
<P>
   ``We could maybe partner with some of the department stores to
run a shuttle from the convention center, but it will make more
sense to invest in something like that after it's renovated,'' said
Gossman, referring to the ongoing $70 million renovation and
expansion of the Fort Worth Convention Center.
</P>
<P>
   Gossman said Ridgmar would be interested in working with the
state but only if it did not involve a sizable investment in the
state's retail tourism effort.
</P>
<P>
   Festival Discount Mall in southeast Arlington has already tried
to tap into the tourism market and would welcome help from the
state, the mall's general manager said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Last year, we took out full-page ads in the program guides for
the Rangers and the Cowboys,'' General Manager Bob Cesare said.
``In the future we want to see if there is an opportunity for
partnership with Six Flags Over Texas, The Ballpark, Palace of Wax
and Ripley's Believe It or Not. ''

NEW YORK CITY'S POPULARITY SOARS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JERRY MORRIS  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   If you thought New York City had lost its luster, think again.
</P>
<P>
   Last year NYC was the number one destination for international
visitors and moved past Las Vegas as the nation's second most
popular destination after Orlando, Fla.
</P>
<P>
   ``Not only is New York the best restaurant city in the world,
it's also home to the best culture, shopping, theater, nightlife,
and attractions,'' says a man who knows restaurants, Tim Zagat,
president of the Zagat Survey restaurant guides.
</P>
<P>
   Zagat was speaking not as a restaurant reviewer but as chairman
of NYC &AMP; Company, the city's privately financed tourism marketing
agency.
</P>
<P>
   ``Exceeding all expectations, the 1999 visitor figures show that
what attracts millions of visitors from around the world is New
York City's amazing range of activities,'' Zagat added.
</P>
<P>
   The total number of visitors jumped 11 percent over 1998 to 36.7
million and is projected to top 38.4 million this year. Since 1995,
the visitor figures have surged 28 percent.
</P>
<P>
   OK, so Orlando has more visitors mainly because of that mouse,
but Mickey is also contributing to New York's visitor totals with
three shows within the great lights of the new, cleaned up, and
almost crime-free Times Square.
</P>
<P>
   Even without Disney, New York City has been, is, and always will
be a great place to visit _ there's no other city like it. Sure,
Las Vegas now has a New York _ and a few other pseudo destination
casino resorts _ but there's still only one Big Apple.
</P>
<P>
   As Zagat says, it is home to the ``best'' and certainly the
amazing, as the city goes beyond skyscrapers, dining, theater, and
culture. ``More than anywhere else on the planet, it's the place
people go hoping to transform their lives,'' noted Kurt Andersen in
last week's New York Times Magazine's special issue on the city and
the people who have made it home.
</P>
<P>
   And for these reasons, anytime is the time to visit. But the
upcoming seasons of fall and winter are special. Fall marks the
beginning of the cultural season _ if you want to know why NYC is
the Empire City, take in the Metropolitan Museum of Art's exhibit
on the making of the Empire City _ and winter brings the magic of
the holidays.
</P>
<P>
   No matter what your reason for visiting, chances are you'll find
yourself in Times Square; it's not known as the ``Crossroads of the
World'' for nothing. Some 27 million tourists annually visit the
30-block area.
</P>
<P>
   Yes it is overcrowded at times, but that along with the bright
lights and all the new attractions is what makes it so exciting.
</P>
<P>
   Times Square is where you'll find theaters ('99 was a record
year for Broadway), hotels (20 percent of NYC's hotels are here),
high-tech entertainment, TV studios, bright lights, and shopping.
Times Square has changed a lot.
</P>
<P>
   Here's just a sampling of what you'll find in the Times Square
area: high-tech electronic and entertainment centers for all ages;
the ESPN Zone, a dining and sports center; NASDAQ Market Site where
you can learn about investing; TV studios for CNBC, ABC, and MTV;
even the World Wrestling Federation is here, and you can dine and
watch a live match.
</P>
<P>
   Museums are bursting with reasons to come. The Metropolitan
Museum of Art is featuring an exhibit that tells how NYC became the
Empire City; the American Museum of Natural History is where you'll
find the fantastic Rose Center for Earth and Space; and, beginning
Oct. 21, is ``Vikings: The North Atlantic Saga,'' commemorating the
1,000-year anniversary of the Vikings' arrival in North America;
even the New York Police have a new museum (25 Broadway between
Morris Street and Battery Place); beginning Thursday, the Museum of
Modern Art will focus on post-1960 works from its collection in
``Open Ends,'' the final exhibition of the MoMA2000 series;
beginning Oct. 5, the Whitney Museum of American Art offers a
retrospective of works by Edward Steichen, one of the greatest
photographers of the 20th century.
</P>
<P>
   That's a little of what is happening in Manhattan _ but hardly
all. The holiday season begins with the world-famous Macy's
Thanksgiving Parade; the Radio City Christmas Spectacular runs Nov.
2-Jan. 7; the Rockefeller Center Tree Lighting is Nov. 29 at 8
p.m.; and there will be great lights at the New York Botanical
Garden during its Holiday Garden &AMP; Train Show Nov. 24-Jan. 7; and
the Empire State Building will put on its own colorful show during
December and January.

SEQUEL TO DROUGHT BOOK WOULD BE THE SAME OLD DRY STORY
</HEADLINE>
  (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
 By ART CHAPMAN 
 c.2000 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   The Texas drought is not over because it rained in a few places,
but talk of the drought might subside.
</P>
<P>
   That would be welcome news to Elmer Kelton, the San Angelo
writer who penned the fictional, but defining, book on dry Texas
weather, ``The Time It Never Rained.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Oh, it's still been dry out here,'' he said from his home near
the campus of Angelo State University. ``We haven't had any rain
since June, so people I run into invariably ask if I'm going to do
an update, or additional chapter, or another book.''
</P>
<P>
   Kelton said he figures there really isn't any incentive to do a
new book on the seven-year drought of the 1950s. ``It would be like
a remake of an old movie,'' he said. ``There might be some new
faces, but it would still be the same old story.''
</P>
<P>
   And there's really nothing new to the story of Texas drought.
</P>
<P>
   In Kelton's introduction to ``The Time It Never Rained,'' he
opens with the ageless West Texas joke about the man who bet
several of his friends that it would never rain again _ and
collected from two of them.
</P>
<P>
   In an essay written this month by Sen. Kay Bailey Hutchison,
R-Texas, she noted that a child born in Texas who started
kindergarten this fall would not know anything but drought.
</P>
<P>
   ``Here we go again; parched, panting, having lived through
another one of the worst summers on record,'' Hutchison wrote.
``Temperatures averaged up to 5 degrees above normal over large
parts of our state through August. Central and West Texas received
less than 25 percent of normal rainfall in July, and parts of Texas
were without rain for a staggering 68 days.''
</P>
<P>
   Here in Fort Worth, we staggered way past that mark.
</P>
<P>
   West Texans might be used to it, but not us.
</P>
<P>
   Texas historian Walter Prescott Webb once decided that the 98th
meridian was where the landscape changed in Texas. West of that
line people's lives were affected more by the weather, he said, and
it etched its marks on their characters and culture.
</P>
<P>
   That line cuts between Weatherford and Mineral Wells. The latter
city, by Webb's accounting, would be West Texas; Weatherford would
not be.
</P>
<P>
   But the real demarcation point between West Texas and the rest
of the state is more indefinite than Webb's declaration. Many
people believe that West Texas is out beyond towns such as
Breckenridge and Throckmorton and Albany. Some folks believe that
West Texas is more attitudinal than longitudinal.
</P>
<P>
   In this current drought, the lines are smeared illegibly anyway.
We've all suffered our share of blast-furnace heat and endless dry
winds.
</P>
<P>
   Hutchison, in her essay, tallied the loss of the state's No. 1
cash crop, cotton, at an estimated $285 million. Other losses
include $125 million in wheat and $50 million in forage crops.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hay production reached a standstill by mid-summer and
producers face soaring feed, water and added irrigation costs,''
Hutchison wrote.
</P>
<P>
   The Texas Agricultural Extension Service reports that, by the
end of August, Texans had suffered $595 million in agriculture
losses, and they are still counting.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've talked with some people out on the land, and I think the
economics of this drought is worse than in the 1950s,'' Kelton
said. ``The prices of the commodities _ the sheep, goats, cattle,
crops _ haven't increased very much from the '50s, but it costs so
much more to produce them.''
</P>
<P>
   Kelton said he knew that some ranchers had reduced their herds
to 25 percent of their normal numbers.
</P>
<P>
   But the talk of drought is dwindling a little now that fall has
inched its way across Texas, and showers have made grown people
gaze, open-mouthed from their office windows.
</P>
<P>
   Kelton appreciates the lull.
</P>
<P>
   ``Drought is not one of my favorite subjects,'' he said. ``I've
said about all I ever want to about it.''

LL COOL J AGING WITH AUTHORITY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By RENEE GRAHAM  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   LL Cool J has the top-selling album in the country _ but, to
bite one of his most famous rhymes, don't call it a comeback, he's
been here for years.
</P>
<P>
   ``G.O.A.T. Featuring James T. Smith: The Greatest Of All Time,''
debuted in the top slot of Billboard's album chart, hip-checking
St. Louis upstart Nelly's ``Country Grammar'' out of the penthouse
for the first time in five weeks. Of course, having a rap album
enter the charts at No. 1 isn't news _ Eminem, Jay-Z, and DMX,
among others, have all done it. But LL Cool J gets big props for
accomplishing the feat nine albums into a career that began before
Lil' Bow Wow was born, before hip-hop blew up on Madison Avenue,
and when Eminem was just a skittish slab of bully bait in Detroit
named Marshall.
</P>
<P>
   While some troublemaking rappers are more likely to face 15-year
sentences than 15-year hitmaking careers, LL Cool J has enjoyed
longevity in a genre with a notoriously short attention span _
anyone remember Skee-Lo, Yo-Yo, or Speech? From the beatbox
minimalism of his first hit, ``I Can't Live Without My Radio,'' to
the rabbit punch of ``Mama Said Knock You Out,'' to his latest
slinky single, ``Imagine That,'' he has stayed current without
pandering to the bling-bling blahs of contemporary rap. And save
for the Beastie Boys, LL Cool J is the only rapper from hip-hop's
nascent years who remains a playa, and is still making vibrant,
vital music for a whole new generation of hip-hop heads.
</P>
<P>
   At 31, LL is one of rap's elder statesmen, and may be one of the
few who deserves to lay claim to the title, the greatest of all
time _ Vibe magazine calls him ``the Muhammad Ali of hip-hop.''
He's crossed over into a successful film career, but it's the music
that has sustained him, and he's done it all without a platinum
grill, waving a gun at anybody, or making headlines with ``Behind
the Music''-style excesses.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hey yo, this is the infinite, intelligent, extravagant and
eloquent,'' LL says by way of introduction on this latest CD, his
most consistent effort since 1991's ``Mama Said Knock You Out.'' On
``G.O.A.T.'' there are lots of guest appearances, including DMX, Ja
Rule, Snoop Dogg, Method Man, Kelly Price and Prodigy, but LL is
always the center of attention. Cuts like ``Queens Is,'' and ``Back
Where I Belong'' are as hard-hitting as anything LL has done in
years. On ``Homicide,'' the CD's standout track, he laments that
murder in the inner city never garners the outrage or attention
afforded violence in the suburbs:
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
(lyrics style &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   I don't mean this in a disrespectful way
</P>
<P>
   But Columbine happens in the ghetto everyday
</P>
<P>
   But when the (expletive) goes down
</P>
<P>
   Y'all ain't got nothing to say
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
(end lyrics style) &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   But, as usual, LL's got plenty to say. He smacks up
actor-comedian Jamie Foxx, his co-star in Oliver Stone's ``Any
Given Sunday,'' in unprintable terms, and just plain hurts
Canibus's feelings on ``Back Where I Belong.'' LL and Canibus have
been trading barbs in a manner reminiscent of LL's inspired
``feud'' with Kool Moe Dee back in the day. (And since LL's topping
the charts, and Kool Moe Dee hasn't had a hit record since the late
'80s, I guess we know who won the war.)
</P>
<P>
   Born James Todd Smith, LL Cool J first burst onto the scene in
1985 as a cocky 16-year-old with ``I Can't Live Without My Radio,''
his ode to that ultimate old-school accessory, the ghetto blaster.
With his Kangol, sweatsuits, fat-laced sneakers, and gold chains
heavy enough to anchor an ocean liner, he was a b-boy straight of
Queens, N.Y., which also produced his stylistic forefathers,
Run-DMC. With such instant classics as ``Rock the Bells'' and ``I
Need a Beat,'' he established himself as a rapper with a hard,
clear style similiar to Joseph ``Run'' Simmons.
</P>
<P>
   But there was more to LL than just block-rockin' beats. He was
rap's first sex symbol. He was singing the praises of the ample
female posterior on ``Big Ole Butt'' long before Sir Mix-a-Lot or
Juvenile, and dared to put a ballad, ``I Need Love,'' on his 1987
album, ``Bigger and Deffer.'' It was a masterstroke for someone who
has always been more lover man than gangsta, and he lived up to his
moniker, which stands for ``Ladies Love Cool James.'' (Of course,
having the sexiest pair of lips on earth certainly hasn't hurt
either.)
</P>
<P>
   ``G.O.A.T'' is proof that LL will stay at the top of the hip-hop
heap until he's ready to come down, and all indications are he's
loving the view. At a time when fellow pioneers like Ice-T and
KRS-One are releasing career retrospectives, LL isn't coasting on
his reputation, he's adding to his legend. Fifteen years into a
career that shows no signs of waning, LL Cool J may be bigger and
deffer than ever, still rockin' his peers, and puttin' suckas in
fear.

<P>
   HIGHLAND PARK, N.J. _ Las crisis institucionales en la Argentina
de las ultimas siete decadas no han sido graves solo por lo que
sucedio sino, sobre todo, por lo que no se permitio o no se quiso
que sucediera.
</P>
<P>
   Cientos de veces hubo denuncias y hasta certezas de corrupcion,
de trafico de influencias, de sobornos, de enriquecimientos veloces
e ilegitimos, y otras tantas veces _ casi siempre _ esas historias
terminaron en nada.
</P>
<P>
   La impresion de que el ejercicio del poder y el paso del tiempo
disuelven todas las culpas ha sembrado en la sociedad argentina un
escepticismo moral y un hartazgo ante la impunidad que podria abrir
paso a cualquier aventura politica. La Argentina es, desde hace
tiempo, un pais imprevisible.
</P>
<P>
   Lo que podria no suceder ahora es mucho mas serio que todo lo
que ya ha sucedido. A mediados de agosto, cundio la version, ahora
comprobada, de que un numero indefinido de senadores _ entre seis y
15 _ fueron sobornados por emisarios del gobierno de Fernando de la
Rua para que votaran una ley de reforma laboral demorada desde
hacia meses.
</P>
<P>
   El presidente parece estar exento de toda culpa, pero no sus
colaboradores. El soborno, revelado por el diario La Nacion, puso
al descubierto un tejido de corrupciones que ha dejado a los
argentinos con la boca abierta.
</P>
<P>
   Si el gobierno de De la Rua deja sin identificar a quienes,
desde el gobierno mismo han pagado los sobornos, todas las
instituciones y, mas que ninguna, la figura presidencial, quedaran
seriamente afectadas.
</P>
<P>
   La fe en el presidente todavia sigue en pie, segun revelan las
encuestas, pero esa fe se haria pedazos en mucho menos tiempo de lo
que tardo en construirse si el presidente vacila o espera demasiado
para establecer la verdad.
</P>
<P>
   Sin duda va a ser dificil romper el pacto de silencio que los
senadores corruptos han tejido con sus pares y, eventualmente, con
algunos sectores de sus partidos. Pero el sentido comun indica que
al presidente de la nacion no le sera imposible establecer de donde
salieron los fondos para comprar la ley de reforma laboral, quienes
fueron los emisarios que pagaron las coimas y, a partir de esos
datos, quienes fueron los sobornados.
</P>
<P>
   A la vez, si el miedo a la venganza de sus pares o a convertirse
en apestados politicos sigue enmudeciendo a los senadores que aun
tienen la conciencia limpia, tambien ellos van a aparecer tan
manchados como los demas.
</P>
<P>
   Antes de los golpes militares, la corrupcion era un mal casi
desconocido en la Argentina. Se cometian errores graves en el
manejo de los dineros publicos, como las emisiones exageradas de
moneda del presidente Miguel Juarez Celman en 1889 y 1890, pero no
se robaba.
</P>
<P>
   Despues de 1930, la idea de que el poder podia ser asaltado, no
solo con las armas sino tambien con la codicia, se convirtio en un
anzuelo para las elites. En algunos casos, los cargos publicos
dejaron de ser lo que en verdad son, una carga, para convertirse en
una fuente de beneficios que permitia tanto devolver favores como
proporcionar ganancias extras a funcionarios y amigos.
</P>
<P>
   Los corruptos son pocos. Pero los que han hecho la vista gorda
ante la corrupcion, la han consentido o apanado _ por una mal
entendida solidaridad de partido o de clan _ son la inmensa
mayoria. Para que saltaran a la luz los sobornos de ahora en el
Senado de la nacion, tuvo que haber antes muchos otros sobornos.
</P>
<P>
   Cuantas mas veces era asaltado el poder, mas se perfeccionaba la
impunidad y mas ostentosa se volvia la desverguenza. En la ultima
decada, decenas de presuntas corrupciones fueron denunciadas por
los diarios y hasta por la embajada de los Estados Unidos, sin que
haya habido sino uno que otro preso ocasional.
</P>
<P>
   La exigencia de coimas a la empresa Swift en 1991 por parte de
un cunado del presidente Carlos Menem, la venta de leche en mal
estado por parte del ex-secretario privado Miguel Angel Vicco, el
lavado de dinero y las valijas con billetes que iban y venian por
el aeropuerto internacional de Ezeiza (regido entonces por Ibrahim
Al Ibrahim, el marido sirio de otra cunada de Menem), la entrega de
los servicios postales a las empresas de Alfredo Yabran, un
misterioso amigo del gobierno que termino suicidandose en 1998 ...
</P>
<P>
   Todo eso se acallo con silenciosos alejamientos de los
protagonistas por el foro de ninguna parte, y con la explicacion
presidencial de que la justicia no habia encontrado nada.
</P>
<P>
   En todos los casos, no fueron los poderes publicos sino la
prensa la que destapo las ollas podridas. La inaccion o la
complicidad de la administracion y la negligencia de la justicia
hizo que la opinion publica creyera menos en las instituciones y
mas en lo que decian los diarios.
</P>
<P>
   Al mismo tiempo, se fortalecio lo que podria llamarse una
mediatizacion de la politica. Para ser creibles o populares, para
legitimarse, en suma, un vasto numero de funcionarios se lanzo a la
conquista de los medios. El que lograba saltar a mayor numero de
titulares, el que aparecia mas veces en horarios centrales de la
television y la radio, se creia mas eficaz o mejor.
</P>
<P>
   Eso concedio a los medios la ingrata funcion de fiscales y acabo
por pervertir el sistema, porque la prensa no puede ni debe hacer
lo que es mision de las instituciones, ni las instituciones deben
cumplir con sus obligaciones solo para saltar a los titulares.
</P>
<P>
   Para saciar ese apetito de notoriedad, cierta prensa batio el
parche ante cualquier presuncion de delito, y concedio la misma
atencion a un caso grave de corrupcion o de soborno que a una
denuncia irresponsable. Un clima de sospecha empano entonces a
todas las instituciones y dio pie a la irreflexiva sentencia
popular segun la cual ``son todos unos corruptos,'' lo que
induciria a suponer que la corrupcion es invencible y no queda otra
salida que resignarse.
</P>
<P>
   Tambien, con cierta frecuencia, los medios se pusieron al
servicio de una opinion publica obsesiva, que fija la mirada en el
conflicto de hoy y se desinteresa del conflicto aun no resuelto de
ayer.
</P>
<P>
   Asi fueron disolviendose en la nada las noticias sobre los
juicios por corrupcion que, hasta hace apenas un mes, desvelaban a
la sociedad argentina. A pocos parece importarle ahora lo que esta
haciendo la justicia con los casos de dos funcionarios muy proximos
a Menem _ Victor Alderete y Maria Julia Alsogaray _ que servian
como una prueba para demostrar que no todos los miembros del
gobierno anterior son invulnerables.
</P>
<P>
   En 1972, una denuncia periodistica tambien puso en tela de
juicio todo el sistema politico de los Estados Unidos cuando se
revelaron operaciones ilegales de inteligencia, por parte de
emisarios del gobierno, en las oficinas del partido opositor,
situadas en el edificio Watergate de Washington. El Senado de ese
pais reacciono entonces nombrando una comision especial que, con el
auxilio de un fiscal independiente, investigo el caso y determino
la culpabilidad de figuras cercanas al presidente Richard Nixon,
asi como la del propio presidente.
</P>
<P>
   Podrian los poderes del Estado hacer algo semejante en la
Argentina?
</P>
<P>
   Un aire nuevo entrara al Senado argentino el ano que viene,
cuando los miembros del cuerpo sean elegidos por primera vez de
manera directa, sin depender de negociaciones con las legislaturas
y los gobiernos provinciales.
</P>
<P>
   Pero las costumbres pervertidas del pasado pueden prevalecer si
antes no se limpia la casa. Hay ya demasiada corrupcion acumulada.
</P>
<P>
   Todo lo que el gobierno deje sin esclarecer afectara de manera
irremediable el futuro de las instituciones y, sobre todo, la fe de
los votantes, que lo eligieron por sus promesas de transparencia.
</P>
<P>
   Lo que de ahora en adelante no suceda puede ser muchisimo peor
de lo que ya ha sucedido.

A CITY OF TEARS THEY JUST HAD TO SEE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By BUD COLLINS  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BILBAO, Spain _ The sign at the off-ramp is irresistible:
``GUERNICA 9 Miles.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We have to go back,'' said Ron Sampson, and the van driver was
amenable to the detour. ``Of course we do,'' agreed Judythe Gitlin.
</P>
<P>
   That name plinked some memory chords within the group that had
been rolling through the Basque country of northern Spain.
Destination: Bilbao to goggle at the Goomongous Goog, that
glistening titanium-skinned leviathan somehow risen from a muddy
river, and whose straight name is the Guggenheim Museum. A big fish
in the little stagnant pond that Bilbao had been until its arrival
three years ago, the Goog makes the city a go-go-round for gawkers
from all over.
</P>
<P>
   But it had to wait a while for us. There was no ignoring the
intriguing highway sign, indicating that Guernica _ with its own
ties to the art world _ wasn't far away.
</P>
<P>
   For 63 years the name Guernica has been branded on the universal
human conscience (if there is such a thing), ever since a ghastly
air raid previewed the horror from on high that was in store for
mankind over the remainder of the century.
</P>
<P>
   In a time before television, and because it took place within a
police state, Franco's Spain, where information was tightly
controlled, the destruction of the Basque community near the north
coast might have gone largely unnoticed. The man who made that
forever impossible was Pablo Picasso, the Spanish artist
self-exiled in France.
</P>
<P>
   Picasso's huge oil portrait of terror from the sky, (11 1/2 by
25 1/2 feet), titled ``Guernica,'' quickly became known, eventually
an all-time renowned painting, an indelible reminder of brutality
as mirrored in the faces of Guernicans. It was put on display in
Paris shortly after the April 26, 1937, raid, and has traveled, now
belonging to the Prado in Madrid. I recall being chillingly
transfixed by it at New York's Museum of Modern Art some time ago.
It stays with you in funereal black, white, and gray.
</P>
<P>
   Guernica was especially infamous because the remorseless Fascist
dictator, Francisco Franco, called in foreigners' bombs on his own
people. To him the independent-minded Basques, siding with his
wartime enemies, were irritants, deserving of a jolt. (Some of
them, the assassination-minded separatists, still are troublesome.)
</P>
<P>
   Be my guest, was the message Franco gave his dictatorial soul
brothers, the German Hitler and Italian Mussolini, who had been
lending him a helpful air arm during the Spanish Civil War
(1936-39). Thus German and Italian planes, practicing for imminent
World War II, were directed toward Guernica, the spiritual home of
the Basque people.
</P>
<P>
   Franco denied all. Naturally. The truth came out after his death
in 1975 freed Spain for democracy. Plans were carefully made to hit
Guernica on a market day when bloodshed would be the greatest, and
1,645 perished, out of a population of 7,000, during the incessant
pounding of a long, vile afternoon.
</P>
<P>
   But does a Guernica exist? Or is it just a name symbolic of a
tragedy, remaining only on canvas in a museum? Inland, away from
the main coastal highway, it does indeed appear in a pine-rimmed
valley, rebuilt, not particularly noteworthy in structure _ except
that the revered oaks, so dear to Basque hearts, are in place, and
the elder, a sapling in 1860, survived the bombing.
</P>
<P>
   Boughs of an oak have traditionally sheltered Basque lawmakers
since the Middle Ages. Theirs was an outdoor legislature. Today the
territory's General Assembly meets in the severely handsome granite
Assembly House, that goes back to 1826, while the honored trees _
the Guernica Oaks _ stand in the surrounding garden.
</P>
<P>
   ``They represent our heritage,'' says a guard. ``There will
always be a Tree of Guernica (Gernika in the Basque tongue). To
make sure, we have three currently.''
</P>
<P>
   Pointing to a section of dead trunk within a pillared cupola, he
says, ``That's the oldest, a remnant about 300 years old. Its
successor, over there, was planted 140 years ago, and is healthy.
Thankfully, bombs missed it.'' Next in line is the baby, a mere 38.
</P>
<P>
   Decorated with large historic paintings, and boasting a
sprawling oak in stained glass, the chandeliered Assembly Chamber
is very formal. It must have been more fun for earlier
representatives casting acorns at each other, as well as their
votes, beneath the old oak tree.
</P>
<P>
   The new money-tree museum _ a whale of a building, and a gamble
_ with its roots in the brain of American architect Frank Gehry,
has enriched Bilbao, an otherwise undistinguished industrial city.
Underwriting the Goog (a branch of New York's Guggenheim Museum),
Bilbao and the Basque government took a $100 million fling that
paid off in tourism dollars.
</P>
<P>
   The Gehrymandering of a tired town has perked it up in the form
of other new construction, and plans for more. A luxury hotel, a
music hall, and a convention center are going up in the
neighborhood.
</P>
<P>
   Santiago Calatrava, the brilliant Spanish architect, has built a
feathery steel footbridge across the Nervion River that flows
beside the Goog. His delicate-looking metal works have brightened
Lisbon (a bridge and train station) and Milwaukee (an addition to
the art museum).
</P>
<P>
   ``This place,'' says a Goog guide, Ainhoa Telletxea, ``is what
you Americans would call `the franchise.' Bilbao needed
revitalization, and the Guggenheim started it. The price has been
recovered already. We will have over 2 million visitors this
year.''
</P>
<P>
   Feeling kinship with Gehry's gleaming gargantua of titanium
plating, my right hip of the same stuff tingles in admiration.
While Gehry has gotten rave notices for his work, I have only rave
notices for orthopedic architect/carver Tucker Aufranc, who
restored my maneuverability at the New England Baptist Hospita.
</P>
<P>
   The Goog, Gehry's dreamscape, seems to maneuver constantly as
you circumnavigate it on foot. Undulation is its occupation. It is
never still, flashing more curves than a chorus line _ ``sensual
contours,'' says my friend, Aurelio _ and heaving waves of metal
that bring to mind both Moby Dick and the Pequod's prow. Ahab would
try to harpoon it and end up feeling like Quixote.
</P>
<P>
   Offsetting the silvery dazzle of sunlight against the walls is
the gigantic rain-bowlegged guard dog designed by Jeff Koons at one
corner. A steel frame constantly emblazoned with fresh flowers, his
Fido is a 50-foot tall, barkless bouquet.
</P>
<P>
   Only the floors inside are flat. An interior of varied levels is
interrupted by precipices and peaks, canyons, vast galleries, and
lots of glass that takes two months to clean, a task that is
undertaken two or three times a year.
</P>
<P>
   However, there is trouble. The titanium is showing alarming
signs of rust that has startled the management, but is being
fought. Andrea Gerlin writes in the Philadelphia Inquirer, ``But
one thing seems clear: This creation of space-age glimmer and
technology is also a monument to the law of unintended
consequences.''
</P>
<P>
   Will the monument wear a rust belt? Aurelio, ever a diligent
scrubber, and crazy about the Goog, wants to volunteer for the
battle with a Teflon pad and Rustoleum. I tell her to leave her
name at the reception desk. ``Don't call them _ they'll call you.''
</P>
<P>
   Like the Getty Museum in Los Angeles, the Goog itself is the
objet d'art, rather than the collections on exhibit. Among the few
Picasso paintings is a blank space reserved for the expected visit
of honorable ``Guernica.''

<TEXT>
<P>
   We've all worked with people who are star performers but have
one serious personality shortcoming that makes life difficult for
everyone, limits their effectiveness and often proves to be their
professional undoing.
</P>
<P>
   In the words of one executive we worked with, such people are
''95 percent brilliant, 5 percent disaster.''
</P>
<P>
   Here are some tactics that you can use to help these otherwise
valuable people get beyond their psychological limitations.
</P>
<P>
   THE HERO
</P>
<P>
   The hero is often the last person a manager wants to change.
After all, why would you want to tamper with someone who gets more
done in a day than others do in a week?
</P>
<P>
   The answer is that over the long term, the hero's constant
pushing adds real costs to the bottom line even if those costs are
obscured by short-term results.
</P>
<P>
   If you look carefully at the hero's trail, you'll probably find
the footprints of valuable people who left the company after trying
to keep up with the hero's superhuman exertions. Within the
company, you'll find burned-out co-workers. And the hero himself
may be thoroughly spent, too.
</P>
<P>
   Some heroes become addicted to success at an early age; others
push as a way of dealing with their own shaky self-esteem. An ``I'm
gonna show them'' mentality. Clearly, heroes lack the empathy
needed to understand what others are going through to keep up.
</P>
<P>
   To change a hero's behavior, express your appreciation for his
accomplishments. Then quickly segue into a discussion about the
costs of burnout _ in himself and in his team members.
</P>
<P>
   The hero must learn to take regular readings of his team's
temperature and to pay attention to body language, facial
expressions and energy levels that subtly indicate resistance or
dismay.
</P>
<P>
   As the hero's manager, you may want to help him make a checklist
of warning signs that the temperature is getting too hot: for
example, the times that he and others are leaving voice messages
and e-mails, the rising levels of illness among employees and
reports of marital troubles. The hero should fill out the list
weekly and discuss it with you.
</P>
<P>
   Heroes have to think more about winning the war and less about
the individual battles. Emphasize that you need your hero to make
strategic decisions; he should delegate the implementation whenever
possible. You might even encourage him to hire an assistant.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, it is essential that someone take on the official role
of observing the hero. The goal is to turn down the volume without
switching it off. You could do this yourself, or help your hero
choose a trusted co-worker to carry out this task.
</P>
<P>
   THE MERITOCRAT
</P>
<P>
   Meritocrats believe that the world is a fair market in which the
best ideas will always win on their own merit. Such people
typically excelled at school and were consistently rewarded for
getting the highest score. Thus they have a naive reliance on the
authority of objective, measurable facts. They never accepted that
in the real world, ideas have to be sold, negotiated and shaped to
meet political and organizational realities.
</P>
<P>
   To help a meritocrat, you should first offer sympathy. Agree
that it's really an awful waste of time to have to persuade people
to support ideas of clear merit.
</P>
<P>
   The next step is to raise a very difficult question: ``How
effective do you want to be?'' We've done this ourselves by using
Jimmy Carter as an example. Carter, we say, was a highly principled
and intelligent president who stayed unswervingly true to his
ideals. And yet even the most die-hard Democrat would agree that
Ronald Reagan was more effective than Carter at winning
congressional and public support for his agenda. We ask, ``Do you
want to be 100 percent pure, like Carter, or do you want to be
effective, like Reagan? You must choose one or the other.''
</P>
<P>
   A manager needs to help them see that it is possible to operate
in gray areas, accomplish a great deal and still emerge relatively
unsullied.
</P>
<P>
   Like the hero, the meritocrat has to learn much more about his
team. For each member, he needs to ask himself: What does this
person work for _ big money, prestige, intellectual challenge,
acquisition of power? Only when the meritocrat understands and
takes into account individual differences can he figure out how to
get people to support his goals and make their strongest
contribution to a project.
</P>
<P>
   THE BULLDOZER
</P>
<P>
   Bulldozers are people who decided early on that the world is a
hostile place where you should do unto others before they do unto
you _ plus 10 percent. They don't trust others, and others don't
trust them. At the same time, they're extremely loyal to their
bosses, and they get things done _ which is why they're worth
trying to help.
</P>
<P>
   Bulldozers are often reluctant to change a style that, by their
lights, is highly effective. So to change a bulldozer, you have to
become one yourself.
</P>
<P>
   Start by asking him if he has any idea how many enemies he has
created within the company. Follow this with a powerful line we've
used in our consulting: ``If I put it to a vote, there's no
question _ you'd be fired.''
</P>
<P>
   The threat of being fired is usually quite motivating. If the
bulldozer says he's willing to listen, the next step is to begin a
campaign of rapprochement. Tell him to make a list of his victims.
Then the two of you should script out an apology for each one.
</P>
<P>
   The ultimate goal, of course, is to get the bulldozer to avoid
causing damage in the first place. To do that, he has to become
more aware of when he is about to roll over someone so he can stop
himself.
</P>
<P>
   As with a hero, it's a good idea at the beginning to agree on
someone the bulldozer trusts to monitor his behavior. If the
bulldozer shows a willingness to change, he'll be able to build
roads for you without flattening people in his way.
</P>
<P>
   THE PESSIMIST
</P>
<P>
   Pessimists' worries are sometimes justified _ they're based on a
knowledge of mistakes that others have made. More frequently,
though, pessimists simply stifle creativity and block fruitful
opportunities. They also tend to micromanage, looking over
everyone's shoulders lest a mistake be made.
</P>
<P>
   Pessimists are motivated primarily by a fear of shame of being
wrong or inadequate. And avoidance of shame can spread insidiously
throughout an organization's culture, destroying the company's
capacity to innovate and take risks.
</P>
<P>
   Tell the pessimist that you're on his side in looking at
proposals for change with appropriate caution. That positioning
lets you avoid a pointless wrangle over the pros and cons of any
particular initiative.
</P>
<P>
   Then point out that you're afraid that the impact of his alarms
is diminishing. Moreover, he's giving the other members of his
group a free ride: ``They don't have to worry and express their
reservations. You do that.'' The message: It's OK to worry, but
your fears must do more than guard the status quo; they should have
a constructive edge.
</P>
<P>
   Teach him how to evaluate risk better. Tell your pessimist that
when a change initiative is proposed, he must consider the pros and
cons of making the change as well as the pros and cons of doing
nothing. This way, he will be forced into a more objective risk
analysis.
</P>
<P>
   THE REBEL
</P>
<P>
   Although they fancy themselves as revolutionaries, rebels'
protests against ``the system'' don't go beyond simple grousing.
They're the ones who ask the inappropriate questions in meetings,
make jokes about the company's management and publicly question the
motives behind any major change.
</P>
<P>
   What rebels enjoy most is a game of tug of war. So your first
tactic is to refuse to play.
</P>
<P>
   Co-opt the rebel by making him responsible for a relatively
high-profile task that requires him to win the cooperation of
others. In essence, you pull him out of the heckling audience and
push him into the spotlight.
</P>
<P>
   Another approach is to begin by asking the rebel, in a neutral
tone, if he's thinking about quitting. When he says no (with
surprise), tell him that you were wondering because he always seems
to be butting up against the limits and putting the organization
down. If he says, ``No, I'm only kidding around,'' come back
forcefully: ``I don't buy that. And in any event, the things you
say hurt people and the morale of the group. That must stop!''
</P>
<P>
   Then shift to a different gear: ``But more to the point, you
seem to think that a lot of things around here should be changed.
True? Well, right now you're about as effective a revolutionary as
a 3-year-old. If you're going to battle the counterproductive
aspects of the `regime,' why not do it effectively?''
</P>
<P>
   Now you have the chance to help your rebel become a real leader
of change. His first assignment should be to spend a week as a
cultural anthropologist, noting all the subtle elements of your
organization's culture: what people reveal about their personal
lives; how they align in groups; how decisions are made officially
and how they are really made; and so on. You should require him to
hand you a written report.
</P>
<P>
   Then ask: ``If you were a real revolutionary fighting somewhere
against a dictatorship, would it be better to stand out or to blend
in?'' The answer is clear, so push the rebel to the logical
conclusion. ``You have a choice. You can work to change things here
or you can follow your old pattern and just be an irritant. If you
choose the latter, your career will stall. We need people like you
to help improve this place.''
</P>
<P>
   Instead of being negative just for its own sake, he'll turn his
energies toward constructive criticism and the building of a better
company.
</P>
<P>
   THE HOME RUN HITTER
</P>
<P>
   The home run hitter is always imagining the roar of the crowd
when the ball clears the outfield fence. However, he tends to
strike out a lot, swinging for the fence when a simple base hit
would have helped the team. Put simply, home run hitters focus on
things that are too big too soon.
</P>
<P>
   As a home run hitter's manager, you need to deliver two
messages: (1) you appreciate his drive, ambition and
self-confidence; and (2) you want to move him up the curve as
quickly as possible but at a pace that ensures his steady progress
_ he must stay with the program.
</P>
<P>
   The next step is to explain just what the program, be it
spending time overseas or working more with particular clients.
Look at people in positions that he aspires to and explain their
career trajectories; that way, he'll understand that they didn't
just walk in and take over.
</P>
<P>
   Home run hitters worry that they'll never get ahead, and they
feel that their strenuous efforts go unappreciated. Therefore, talk
with them often about their career progression and praise them
frequently. This will help reassure your home run hitter that,
given a little time, he'll have his shot at the big leagues.
</P>
<P>
   Although the tactics we recommend here won't work in every case,
they can help turn some of your brilliantly flawed performers into
spectacular achievers _ to the benefit of themselves and your
company.

<P>
   Anti-business protesters have always sought to gain the upper
hand over the corporations they target. In one theater of conflict,
the Internet, they are succeeding.
</P>
<P>
   Fueled by a combination of passion and tech savvy, activists
have launched sophisticated sites that attack individual companies
with eye-catching images, useful links, forceful prose, and even
audio and video streams.
</P>
<P>
   By contrast, most corporate sites either avoid controversial
issues, such as labor and environmental practices, or address them
with little more than bland text on hard-to-find pages.
</P>
<P>
   Take the issue of genetic modification. The UK government
cabinet office posts special Web pages to allay public concerns
about the safety of genetically modified food products
(www.cabinet-office. gov.uk/gm-info). They contain lengthy policy
statements and submissions from scientists and regulators.
</P>
<P>
   Turn now to www.gm-info.org.uk, the Web site operated by
Corporate Watch. It contains lively, interesting and well-reasoned
articles on the risks associated with genetic modification,
flowcharts showing how business and government interests collide
and case studies targeting the leading biotech companies. It even
features a detailed map of the United Kingdom showing locations of
crop trials and manufacturing and storage facilities. The site as a
whole is brilliant propaganda.
</P>
<P>
   This imbalance between corporate and protest sites is a problem
for two reasons. First, the Internet tilts the playing field in the
activist's favor. On the Web, the reach of a corporate
public-relations machine is no greater than that of any
organization committed to a cause. Moreover, the Web allows
protests to develop almost spontaneously among loose clusters of
organizations and individuals. When no single group is responsible
for a particular action, it's hard to know how to fight back.
</P>
<P>
   Second, the protest sites often have huge constituencies. The
World Wildlife Fund has about 5 million members; Greenpeace has 2.5
million. Corporate Watch claims more than 1 million page views per
month on its Web site, which contains some 430 links to other
protest sites.
</P>
<P>
   In the United Kingdom, the Royal Society for the Protection of
Birds has a larger membership than any other political organization
in the country, including the Labour and Conservative parties.
Given numbers like these, it's clear that an effectively produced
site can have a major impact on public opinion.
</P>
<P>
   Some companies have begun to respond. BP Amoco, for example,
recently upgraded its Web site to reflect the company's shift
toward more open dialogue with a wide range of stakeholders. It
used Greenpeace's visually appealing Shareholders Against New
Exploration (SANE) campaign, which had been aimed at BP Amoco, as a
reference point in redesigning its own site. The corporate site now
has links to environmental information, and one click brings the
viewer to a detailed explanation of the company's efforts to
explore solar energy.
</P>
<P>
   Visitors to the site can watch an animated ``solar story,'' with
audio, that debunks several myths about supposed problems with
solar power.
</P>
<P>
   It's no coincidence that heavily attacked companies such as BP
Amoco and Shell are taking a more open approach to communications
on environmental and social issues. They are debating these issues
in terms that the protest groups use, setting out the choices and
dilemmas they face, and being honest about failures as well as
successes.
</P>
<P>
   They are using the Web, in part, to say, ``We're not perfect. We
don't have the answer to every issue, but we're working with the
best intentions. Here are the issues we have trouble with. Tell us
what you think of them.'
</P>
<P>
   Any major corporation could be subject to a Web attack at almost
any time. In the struggle for hearts and minds, companies would do
well to learn from those attacking them by bringing a measure of
passion and creativity to their own Web presence.

<P>
   HIGHLAND PARK, N.J. _ Las crisis institucionales en la Argentina
de las ultimas siete decadas no han sido graves solo por lo que
sucedio sino, sobre todo, por lo que no se permitio o no se quiso
que sucediera.
</P>
<P>
   Cientos de veces hubo denuncias y hasta certezas de corrupcion,
de trafico de influencias, de sobornos, de enriquecimientos veloces
e ilegitimos, y otras tantas veces _ casi siempre _ esas historias
terminaron en nada.
</P>
<P>
   La impresion de que el ejercicio del poder y el paso del tiempo
disuelven todas las culpas ha sembrado en la sociedad argentina un
escepticismo moral y un hartazgo ante la impunidad que podria abrir
paso a cualquier aventura politica. La Argentina es, desde hace
tiempo, un pais imprevisible.
</P>
<P>
   Lo que podria no suceder ahora es mucho mas serio que todo lo
que ya ha sucedido. A mediados de agosto, cundio la version, ahora
comprobada, de que un numero indefinido de senadores _ entre seis y
15 _ fueron sobornados por emisarios del gobierno de Fernando de la
Rua para que votaran una ley de reforma laboral demorada desde
hacia meses.
</P>
<P>
   El presidente parece estar exento de toda culpa, pero no sus
colaboradores. El soborno, revelado por el diario La Nacion, puso
al descubierto un tejido de corrupciones que ha dejado a los
argentinos con la boca abierta.
</P>
<P>
   Si el gobierno de De la Rua deja sin identificar a quienes,
desde el gobierno mismo han pagado los sobornos, todas las
instituciones y, mas que ninguna, la figura presidencial, quedaran
seriamente afectadas.
</P>
<P>
   La fe en el presidente todavia sigue en pie, segun revelan las
encuestas, pero esa fe se haria pedazos en mucho menos tiempo de lo
que tardo en construirse si el presidente vacila o espera demasiado
para establecer la verdad.
</P>
<P>
   Sin duda va a ser dificil romper el pacto de silencio que los
senadores corruptos han tejido con sus pares y, eventualmente, con
algunos sectores de sus partidos. Pero el sentido comun indica que
al presidente de la nacion no le sera imposible establecer de donde
salieron los fondos para comprar la ley de reforma laboral, quienes
fueron los emisarios que pagaron las coimas y, a partir de esos
datos, quienes fueron los sobornados.
</P>
<P>
   A la vez, si el miedo a la venganza de sus pares o a convertirse
en apestados politicos sigue enmudeciendo a los senadores que aun
tienen la conciencia limpia, tambien ellos van a aparecer tan
manchados como los demas.
</P>
<P>
   Antes de los golpes militares, la corrupcion era un mal casi
desconocido en la Argentina. Se cometian errores graves en el
manejo de los dineros publicos, como las emisiones exageradas de
moneda del presidente Miguel Juarez Celman en 1889 y 1890, pero no
se robaba.
</P>
<P>
   Despues de 1930, la idea de que el poder podia ser asaltado, no
solo con las armas sino tambien con la codicia, se convirtio en un
anzuelo para las elites. En algunos casos, los cargos publicos
dejaron de ser lo que en verdad son, una carga, para convertirse en
una fuente de beneficios que permitia tanto devolver favores como
proporcionar ganancias extras a funcionarios y amigos.
</P>
<P>
   Los corruptos son pocos. Pero los que han hecho la vista gorda
ante la corrupcion, la han consentido o apanado _ por una mal
entendida solidaridad de partido o de clan _ son la inmensa
mayoria. Para que saltaran a la luz los sobornos de ahora en el
Senado de la nacion, tuvo que haber antes muchos otros sobornos.
</P>
<P>
   Cuantas mas veces era asaltado el poder, mas se perfeccionaba la
impunidad y mas ostentosa se volvia la desverguenza. En la ultima
decada, decenas de presuntas corrupciones fueron denunciadas por
los diarios y hasta por la embajada de los Estados Unidos, sin que
haya habido sino uno que otro preso ocasional.
</P>
<P>
   La exigencia de coimas a la empresa Swift en 1991 por parte de
un cunado del presidente Carlos Menem, la venta de leche en mal
estado por parte del ex-secretario privado Miguel Angel Vicco, el
lavado de dinero y las valijas con billetes que iban y venian por
el aeropuerto internacional de Ezeiza (regido entonces por Ibrahim
Al Ibrahim, el marido sirio de otra cunada de Menem), la entrega de
los servicios postales a las empresas de Alfredo Yabran, un
misterioso amigo del gobierno que termino suicidandose en 1998 ...
</P>
<P>
   Todo eso se acallo con silenciosos alejamientos de los
protagonistas por el foro de ninguna parte, y con la explicacion
presidencial de que la justicia no habia encontrado nada.
</P>
<P>
   En todos los casos, no fueron los poderes publicos sino la
prensa la que destapo las ollas podridas. La inaccion o la
complicidad de la administracion y la negligencia de la justicia
hizo que la opinion publica creyera menos en las instituciones y
mas en lo que decian los diarios.
</P>
<P>
   Al mismo tiempo, se fortalecio lo que podria llamarse una
mediatizacion de la politica. Para ser creibles o populares, para
legitimarse, en suma, un vasto numero de funcionarios se lanzo a la
conquista de los medios. El que lograba saltar a mayor numero de
titulares, el que aparecia mas veces en horarios centrales de la
television y la radio, se creia mas eficaz o mejor.
</P>
<P>
   Eso concedio a los medios la ingrata funcion de fiscales y acabo
por pervertir el sistema, porque la prensa no puede ni debe hacer
lo que es mision de las instituciones, ni las instituciones deben
cumplir con sus obligaciones solo para saltar a los titulares.
</P>
<P>
   Para saciar ese apetito de notoriedad, cierta prensa batio el
parche ante cualquier presuncion de delito, y concedio la misma
atencion a un caso grave de corrupcion o de soborno que a una
denuncia irresponsable. Un clima de sospecha empano entonces a
todas las instituciones y dio pie a la irreflexiva sentencia
popular segun la cual ``son todos unos corruptos,'' lo que
induciria a suponer que la corrupcion es invencible y no queda otra
salida que resignarse.
</P>
<P>
   Tambien, con cierta frecuencia, los medios se pusieron al
servicio de una opinion publica obsesiva, que fija la mirada en el
conflicto de hoy y se desinteresa del conflicto aun no resuelto de
ayer.
</P>
<P>
   Asi fueron disolviendose en la nada las noticias sobre los
juicios por corrupcion que, hasta hace apenas un mes, desvelaban a
la sociedad argentina. A pocos parece importarle ahora lo que esta
haciendo la justicia con los casos de dos funcionarios muy proximos
a Menem _ Victor Alderete y Maria Julia Alsogaray _ que servian
como una prueba para demostrar que no todos los miembros del
gobierno anterior son invulnerables.
</P>
<P>
   En 1972, una denuncia periodistica tambien puso en tela de
juicio todo el sistema politico de los Estados Unidos cuando se
revelaron operaciones ilegales de inteligencia, por parte de
emisarios del gobierno, en las oficinas del partido opositor,
situadas en el edificio Watergate de Washington. El Senado de ese
pais reacciono entonces nombrando una comision especial que, con el
auxilio de un fiscal independiente, investigo el caso y determino
la culpabilidad de figuras cercanas al presidente Richard Nixon,
asi como la del propio presidente.
</P>
<P>
   Podrian los poderes del Estado hacer algo semejante en la
Argentina?
</P>
<P>
   Un aire nuevo entrara al Senado argentino el ano que viene,
cuando los miembros del cuerpo sean elegidos por primera vez de
manera directa, sin depender de negociaciones con las legislaturas
y los gobiernos provinciales.
</P>
<P>
   Pero las costumbres pervertidas del pasado pueden prevalecer si
antes no se limpia la casa. Hay ya demasiada corrupcion acumulada.
</P>
<P>
   Todo lo que el gobierno deje sin esclarecer afectara de manera
irremediable el futuro de las instituciones y, sobre todo, la fe de
los votantes, que lo eligieron por sus promesas de transparencia.
</P>
<P>
   Lo que de ahora en adelante no suceda puede ser muchisimo peor
de lo que ya ha sucedido.

<TEXT>
<P>
   HIGHLAND PARK, N.J. _ Over the last 70 years government crises
in Argentina were not notable so much for the things that happened
as for what was prevented from happening.
</P>
<P>
   Hundreds of allegations and even proven claims of corruption,
influence peddling, bribery and sudden illicit wealth were
reported. But most of those charges ended in nothing.
</P>
<P>
   The impression that guilt goes away with the help of government
power and the passage of time has sown such a skepticism in an
Argentinean society already disgusted with the absence of
accountability, that the advent of political adventurism is now a
real possibility. So, Argentina is a country whose future is
unforeseeable.
</P>
<P>
   Therefore, what might not happen now could be far more serious
than what has happened already: In August a rumor surfaced, and
since been verified, that members of Fernando de la Rua's
government paid a number of senators _ it is believed to be between
six and 15 _ to ensure passage of a labor reform bill that had been
mired in Congress for months.
</P>
<P>
   The president himself appears to be innocent, but the same
cannot be said of his people. The bribery scandal, exposed by daily
newspaper La Nacion, revealed an amazing network of corruption that
has shocked Argentineans.
</P>
<P>
   If De la Rua does not identify those from his office who are
responsible for the bribes, every government institution in the
country, including the presidency itself, will be seriously
impaired. Surveys show faith in the president is still high, but
that confidence could disintegrate in much less time than it took
to build if the president holds back the truth.
</P>
<P>
   Undoubtedly, it will be extremely hard to penetrate the web of
secrecy spun by corrupt senators and their partners and even some
sectors of their parties. But common sense dictates that it is not
impossible for the president to determine where the money came from
to buy the labor reform law, who was responsible for the payouts
and who accepted them.
</P>
<P>
   But, at the same time, if even clean senators remain silent out
of fear of colleagues' revenge or of being smeared by the same
dirt, they too will appear as guilty as the rest.
</P>
<P>
   In the years before military takeovers, corruption was almost
unknown in Argentina. For sure, there was serious mishandling of
public funds, such as the extravagant printing of money in 1889 and
1890 during President Miguel Juarez Celman's administration, but it
didn't involve theft or dishonesty.
</P>
<P>
   After 1930, the idea that power could be assailed not only by
arms but also by greed, became an attraction for the ambitious
elite. In some cases, public office changed from being what it
should be _ public service _ to being a source of benefits that
allowed functionaries to repay favors as well as pay off officials
and friends.
</P>
<P>
   The corrupt are not many in number, but those who pretend not to
see the corruption among their peers and have allowed it to
prosper, through perhaps some misguided sense of solidarity,
constitute the overwhelming majority.
</P>
<P>
   For today's bribery scandal in the nation's senate to finally
come to light, there must have been countless others before,
representing barely the tip of the iceberg.
</P>
<P>
   With the perverting of power, came the perfecting of impunity
and brazen shamelessness.
</P>
<P>
   During the last decade, dozens of alleged cases of corruption
have been exposed by the press, and even by the U.S. Embassy, with
only an occasional public official prosecuted.
</P>
<P>
   The accusation of illegal payoffs to the Swift Corp. in 1991 by
a brother-in-law of President Carlos Menem; the sale of tainted
milk by his former private secretary, Miguel Angel Vicco; money
laundering and the countless suitcases stuffed with money coming
and going through the Ezeiza International Airport (run at the time
by Ibrahim al Ibrahim, the Syrian husband of another of Menem's
in-laws); and the decision to sell the postal service to a company
owned by Alfredo Yabran, a mysterious friend of the government, who
ended up committing suicide in 1988 ...
</P>
<P>
   All these incidents were hushed up with the discreet removal of
the perpetrators after no hearings in any known forum, and with the
explanation from the presidency that the attorney general's office
could not find sufficient evidence to prove the charges.
</P>
<P>
   And, in all, it was the press that lifted the lid off the shady
dealings, not the authorities. The government's inaction or
complicity, together with judicial indifference, has engendered
greater public trust in the press than in the government.
</P>
<P>
   Now, a trend that could be called a media-ization of politics
has developed. A vast number of public officials have turned to the
media for legitimacy and publicity. Thus, the politician who
manages to grab the headlines or appear on prime-time television
most frequently, is seen as the more effective and better
qualified.
</P>
<P>
   This has encumbered the media with the thankless function of
being judge and jury and, in so doing, has degraded the political
system: the press cannot and should not do the job of political
institutions, nor should institutions perform their duties with the
sole intent of impressing the media.
</P>
<P>
   To satisfy readers' appetite for scandal, however, certain
newspapers, in a quest to beat corruption, fail to distinguish
between serious allegations of impropriety and irresponsible,
unfounded accusations.
</P>
<P>
   A cloud of suspicion currently hovers over all government
institutions, prompting the public assumption that ``they are all a
bunch of crooks,'' and that there is no alternative but to accept a
corruption that cannot be beaten.
</P>
<P>
   Bowing to obsessive public opinion, the media is now guilty of
concentrating on today's newest scandal, while already forgetting
yesterday's big story.
</P>
<P>
   So, corruption cases that had only a few weeks earlier gripped
the nation, have faded into nothing. Few are interested now in the
trials of two close Menem associates _ Victor Alderete y Maria
Julia Alsogaray _ test cases to demonstrate that government
functionaries are not all immune to prosecution.
</P>
<P>
   In 1972, a newspaper expose brought into question the integrity
of the U.S. political system, when it revealed illegal government
snooping into opposition party campaign offices at Washington's
Watergate Building. On that occasion, the U.S. Senate appointed a
special commission that, with the help of an independent counsel,
investigated the case and determined the guilt of people close to
President Richard Nixon, and even of the president himself.
</P>
<P>
   Could not Argentina exercise the same power?
</P>
<P>
   Next year, the Argentinean Senate will get a shot of fresh air
when members will be elected for the first time by public ballot,
and not through negotiations with provincial governments and
legislatures as before.
</P>
<P>
   But without a thorough house cleaning, unethical practices from
the past may die hard. The mounting corruption is simply too great.
</P>
<P>
   All that the State fails to clear up will irremediably affect
the future of the government and, above all, the faith of voters
who elected the government on promises of openness and honesty.
</P>
<P>
   What doesn't happen, from hereon in, will be much worse that
what has already happened.

<TEXT>
<P>
   We've all worked with people who are star performers but have
one serious personality shortcoming that makes life difficult for
everyone, limits their effectiveness and often proves to be their
professional undoing.
</P>
<P>
   In the words of one executive we worked with, such people are
''95 percent brilliant, 5 percent disaster.''
</P>
<P>
   Here are some tactics that you can use to help these otherwise
valuable people get beyond their psychological limitations.
</P>
<P>
   THE HERO
</P>
<P>
   The hero is often the last person a manager wants to change.
After all, why would you want to tamper with someone who gets more
done in a day than others do in a week?
</P>
<P>
   The answer is that over the long term, the hero's constant
pushing adds real costs to the bottom line even if those costs are
obscured by short-term results.
</P>
<P>
   If you look carefully at the hero's trail, you'll probably find
the footprints of valuable people who left the company after trying
to keep up with the hero's superhuman exertions. Within the
company, you'll find burned-out co-workers. And the hero himself
may be thoroughly spent, too.
</P>
<P>
   Some heroes become addicted to success at an early age; others
push as a way of dealing with their own shaky self-esteem. An ``I'm
gonna show them'' mentality. Clearly, heroes lack the empathy
needed to understand what others are going through to keep up.
</P>
<P>
   To change a hero's behavior, express your appreciation for his
accomplishments. Then quickly segue into a discussion about the
costs of burnout _ in himself and in his team members.
</P>
<P>
   The hero must learn to take regular readings of his team's
temperature and to pay attention to body language, facial
expressions and energy levels that subtly indicate resistance or
dismay.
</P>
<P>
   As the hero's manager, you may want to help him make a checklist
of warning signs that the temperature is getting too hot: for
example, the times that he and others are leaving voice messages
and e-mails, the rising levels of illness among employees and
reports of marital troubles. The hero should fill out the list
weekly and discuss it with you.
</P>
<P>
   Heroes have to think more about winning the war and less about
the individual battles. Emphasize that you need your hero to make
strategic decisions; he should delegate the implementation whenever
possible. You might even encourage him to hire an assistant.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, it is essential that someone take on the official role
of observing the hero. The goal is to turn down the volume without
switching it off. You could do this yourself, or help your hero
choose a trusted co-worker to carry out this task.
</P>
<P>
   THE MERITOCRAT
</P>
<P>
   Meritocrats believe that the world is a fair market in which the
best ideas will always win on their own merit. Such people
typically excelled at school and were consistently rewarded for
getting the highest score. Thus they have a naive reliance on the
authority of objective, measurable facts. They never accepted that
in the real world, ideas have to be sold, negotiated and shaped to
meet political and organizational realities.
</P>
<P>
   To help a meritocrat, you should first offer sympathy. Agree
that it's really an awful waste of time to have to persuade people
to support ideas of clear merit.
</P>
<P>
   The next step is to raise a very difficult question: ``How
effective do you want to be?'' We've done this ourselves by using
Jimmy Carter as an example. Carter, we say, was a highly principled
and intelligent president who stayed unswervingly true to his
ideals. And yet even the most die-hard Democrat would agree that
Ronald Reagan was more effective than Carter at winning
congressional and public support for his agenda. We ask, ``Do you
want to be 100 percent pure, like Carter, or do you want to be
effective, like Reagan? You must choose one or the other.''
</P>
<P>
   A manager needs to help them see that it is possible to operate
in gray areas, accomplish a great deal and still emerge relatively
unsullied.
</P>
<P>
   Like the hero, the meritocrat has to learn much more about his
team. For each member, he needs to ask himself: What does this
person work for _ big money, prestige, intellectual challenge,
acquisition of power? Only when the meritocrat understands and
takes into account individual differences can he figure out how to
get people to support his goals and make their strongest
contribution to a project.
</P>
<P>
   THE BULLDOZER
</P>
<P>
   Bulldozers are people who decided early on that the world is a
hostile place where you should do unto others before they do unto
you _ plus 10 percent. They don't trust others, and others don't
trust them. At the same time, they're extremely loyal to their
bosses, and they get things done _ which is why they're worth
trying to help.
</P>
<P>
   Bulldozers are often reluctant to change a style that, by their
lights, is highly effective. So to change a bulldozer, you have to
become one yourself.
</P>
<P>
   Start by asking him if he has any idea how many enemies he has
created within the company. Follow this with a powerful line we've
used in our consulting: ``If I put it to a vote, there's no
question _ you'd be fired.''
</P>
<P>
   The threat of being fired is usually quite motivating. If the
bulldozer says he's willing to listen, the next step is to begin a
campaign of rapprochement. Tell him to make a list of his victims.
Then the two of you should script out an apology for each one.
</P>
<P>
   The ultimate goal, of course, is to get the bulldozer to avoid
causing damage in the first place. To do that, he has to become
more aware of when he is about to roll over someone so he can stop
himself.
</P>
<P>
   As with a hero, it's a good idea at the beginning to agree on
someone the bulldozer trusts to monitor his behavior. If the
bulldozer shows a willingness to change, he'll be able to build
roads for you without flattening people in his way.
</P>
<P>
   THE PESSIMIST
</P>
<P>
   Pessimists' worries are sometimes justified _ they're based on a
knowledge of mistakes that others have made. More frequently,
though, pessimists simply stifle creativity and block fruitful
opportunities. They also tend to micromanage, looking over
everyone's shoulders lest a mistake be made.
</P>
<P>
   Pessimists are motivated primarily by a fear of shame of being
wrong or inadequate. And avoidance of shame can spread insidiously
throughout an organization's culture, destroying the company's
capacity to innovate and take risks.
</P>
<P>
   Tell the pessimist that you're on his side in looking at
proposals for change with appropriate caution. That positioning
lets you avoid a pointless wrangle over the pros and cons of any
particular initiative.
</P>
<P>
   Then point out that you're afraid that the impact of his alarms
is diminishing. Moreover, he's giving the other members of his
group a free ride: ``They don't have to worry and express their
reservations. You do that.'' The message: It's OK to worry, but
your fears must do more than guard the status quo; they should have
a constructive edge.
</P>
<P>
   Teach him how to evaluate risk better. Tell your pessimist that
when a change initiative is proposed, he must consider the pros and
cons of making the change as well as the pros and cons of doing
nothing. This way, he will be forced into a more objective risk
analysis.
</P>
<P>
   THE REBEL
</P>
<P>
   Although they fancy themselves as revolutionaries, rebels'
protests against ``the system'' don't go beyond simple grousing.
They're the ones who ask the inappropriate questions in meetings,
make jokes about the company's management and publicly question the
motives behind any major change.
</P>
<P>
   What rebels enjoy most is a game of tug of war. So your first
tactic is to refuse to play.
</P>
<P>
   Co-opt the rebel by making him responsible for a relatively
high-profile task that requires him to win the cooperation of
others. In essence, you pull him out of the heckling audience and
push him into the spotlight.
</P>
<P>
   Another approach is to begin by asking the rebel, in a neutral
tone, if he's thinking about quitting. When he says no (with
surprise), tell him that you were wondering because he always seems
to be butting up against the limits and putting the organization
down. If he says, ``No, I'm only kidding around,'' come back
forcefully: ``I don't buy that. And in any event, the things you
say hurt people and the morale of the group. That must stop!''
</P>
<P>
   Then shift to a different gear: ``But more to the point, you
seem to think that a lot of things around here should be changed.
True? Well, right now you're about as effective a revolutionary as
a 3-year-old. If you're going to battle the counterproductive
aspects of the `regime,' why not do it effectively?''
</P>
<P>
   Now you have the chance to help your rebel become a real leader
of change. His first assignment should be to spend a week as a
cultural anthropologist, noting all the subtle elements of your
organization's culture: what people reveal about their personal
lives; how they align in groups; how decisions are made officially
and how they are really made; and so on. You should require him to
hand you a written report.
</P>
<P>
   Then ask: ``If you were a real revolutionary fighting somewhere
against a dictatorship, would it be better to stand out or to blend
in?'' The answer is clear, so push the rebel to the logical
conclusion. ``You have a choice. You can work to change things here
or you can follow your old pattern and just be an irritant. If you
choose the latter, your career will stall. We need people like you
to help improve this place.''
</P>
<P>
   Instead of being negative just for its own sake, he'll turn his
energies toward constructive criticism and the building of a better
company.
</P>
<P>
   THE HOME RUN HITTER
</P>
<P>
   The home run hitter is always imagining the roar of the crowd
when the ball clears the outfield fence. However, he tends to
strike out a lot, swinging for the fence when a simple base hit
would have helped the team. Put simply, home run hitters focus on
things that are too big too soon.
</P>
<P>
   As a home run hitter's manager, you need to deliver two
messages: (1) you appreciate his drive, ambition and
self-confidence; and (2) you want to move him up the curve as
quickly as possible but at a pace that ensures his steady progress
_ he must stay with the program.
</P>
<P>
   The next step is to explain just what the program, be it
spending time overseas or working more with particular clients.
Look at people in positions that he aspires to and explain their
career trajectories; that way, he'll understand that they didn't
just walk in and take over.
</P>
<P>
   Home run hitters worry that they'll never get ahead, and they
feel that their strenuous efforts go unappreciated. Therefore, talk
with them often about their career progression and praise them
frequently. This will help reassure your home run hitter that,
given a little time, he'll have his shot at the big leagues.
</P>
<P>
   Although the tactics we recommend here won't work in every case,
they can help turn some of your brilliantly flawed performers into
spectacular achievers _ to the benefit of themselves and your
company.

<P>
   Anti-business protesters have always sought to gain the upper
hand over the corporations they target. In one theater of conflict,
the Internet, they are succeeding.
</P>
<P>
   Fueled by a combination of passion and tech savvy, activists
have launched sophisticated sites that attack individual companies
with eye-catching images, useful links, forceful prose, and even
audio and video streams.
</P>
<P>
   By contrast, most corporate sites either avoid controversial
issues, such as labor and environmental practices, or address them
with little more than bland text on hard-to-find pages.
</P>
<P>
   Take the issue of genetic modification. The UK government
cabinet office posts special Web pages to allay public concerns
about the safety of genetically modified food products
(www.cabinet-office. gov.uk/gm-info). They contain lengthy policy
statements and submissions from scientists and regulators.
</P>
<P>
   Turn now to www.gm-info.org.uk, the Web site operated by
Corporate Watch. It contains lively, interesting and well-reasoned
articles on the risks associated with genetic modification,
flowcharts showing how business and government interests collide
and case studies targeting the leading biotech companies. It even
features a detailed map of the United Kingdom showing locations of
crop trials and manufacturing and storage facilities. The site as a
whole is brilliant propaganda.
</P>
<P>
   This imbalance between corporate and protest sites is a problem
for two reasons. First, the Internet tilts the playing field in the
activist's favor. On the Web, the reach of a corporate
public-relations machine is no greater than that of any
organization committed to a cause. Moreover, the Web allows
protests to develop almost spontaneously among loose clusters of
organizations and individuals. When no single group is responsible
for a particular action, it's hard to know how to fight back.
</P>
<P>
   Second, the protest sites often have huge constituencies. The
World Wildlife Fund has about 5 million members; Greenpeace has 2.5
million. Corporate Watch claims more than 1 million page views per
month on its Web site, which contains some 430 links to other
protest sites.
</P>
<P>
   In the United Kingdom, the Royal Society for the Protection of
Birds has a larger membership than any other political organization
in the country, including the Labour and Conservative parties.
Given numbers like these, it's clear that an effectively produced
site can have a major impact on public opinion.
</P>
<P>
   Some companies have begun to respond. BP Amoco, for example,
recently upgraded its Web site to reflect the company's shift
toward more open dialogue with a wide range of stakeholders. It
used Greenpeace's visually appealing Shareholders Against New
Exploration (SANE) campaign, which had been aimed at BP Amoco, as a
reference point in redesigning its own site. The corporate site now
has links to environmental information, and one click brings the
viewer to a detailed explanation of the company's efforts to
explore solar energy.
</P>
<P>
   Visitors to the site can watch an animated ``solar story,'' with
audio, that debunks several myths about supposed problems with
solar power.
</P>
<P>
   It's no coincidence that heavily attacked companies such as BP
Amoco and Shell are taking a more open approach to communications
on environmental and social issues. They are debating these issues
in terms that the protest groups use, setting out the choices and
dilemmas they face, and being honest about failures as well as
successes.
</P>
<P>
   They are using the Web, in part, to say, ``We're not perfect. We
don't have the answer to every issue, but we're working with the
best intentions. Here are the issues we have trouble with. Tell us
what you think of them.'
</P>
<P>
   Any major corporation could be subject to a Web attack at almost
any time. In the struggle for hearts and minds, companies would do
well to learn from those attacking them by bringing a measure of
passion and creativity to their own Web presence.

HOW IT WAS WAY BACK WHEN 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By RICHARD P. CARPENTER  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   `The Lion King'' wasn't on Broadway and you couldn't buy a
counterfeit Rolex on the street. But despite those shortcomings,
1898 was an amazing year for a certain city that never sleeps. That
was when the boroughs of Manhattan, the Bronx, Brooklyn, Staten
Island, and Queens were officially consolidated into the colossus
known as New York City. Today's travelers might enjoy a look at the
way it was a little more than a century ago. According to the New
York Convention &AMP; Visitors Bureau:
</P>
<P>
   --The population was 3,350,000 _ less than half what it is
today.
</P>
<P>
   --The tallest building had 23 stories. (The tallest building
today has 110 stories.)
</P>
<P>
   --Thirty-five percent of New Yorkers were foreign-born and 7
percent were illiterate.
</P>
<P>
   --The Lower East Side was the most densely populated place in
the world. It was almost five times as crowded as the rest of the
city.
</P>
<P>
   --But if 1898 was a big year, it couldn't compare with what
happened in 1899. In that year, the city raked in $38,000 by
issuing permits for masked balls.
</P>
<P>

   Travel Trivia: You may know that in New York City, SoHo stands
for South of Houston Street and that Tribeca is short for Triangle
Below Canal Street. But what does DuMBO stand for? (Answer at end

   In a name: Latinos and others call New York's Washington Heights
``Platano Heights'' because of the great number of Dominicans

   As we noted last week, there are alternative explanations for
familiar expressions that some say originated aboard ships. Milton
Paisner of North Andover, Mass., for instance, tells a delightful
story that covers two phrases:
</P>
<P>
   ``At a country fair in England some years ago a con man spotted
a country bumpkin and called him aside. He said to the lad ...,
`You have walked around the fair and you have seen prime young pigs
offered for 10 pounds each. Now I have one of those pigs and
because I like you, I want you to have it, not for 10 pounds, but
for just one _ on condition that you take it home in this bag
without showing it to anyone else. That way, no one else will see
what a bargain you have.'
</P>
<P>
   ``The young man paid his pound and took his bag home. When he
opened it, he found a mangy old cat inside. What happened? He
bought a pig in a poke and when he opened it he let the cat out of
the bag.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
------ &QC; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   On the same topic, Mary Roever of Hingham, Mass. writes,
``According to other sources, `mind your P's and Q's' was said in
every bar, tavern, and taproom in colonial Boston at closing time,
and referred to Pints and Quarts. This sounds much more
straightforward and logical than (a cruise line's theory involving)
jackets and pigtails, doesn't it?
</P>
<P>
   &QL;

 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A Canadian reader's suggestion that US residents call themselves
something else besides ``Americans'' (perhaps ``Usanians'' or even
``Bob'') continues to draw reader comment. Peter N. Antonellis of
West Quincy, Mass. writes, ``US citizens are called Americans
because the official name of our country is the United States of
America, which makes us Americans. ... All the people of the North
and South American continents are not Americans. ... They are
Canadians, Mexicans, Brazilians, Argentinians, etc., because of
their country, not their continent. Before anyone considers
`Usanians' or `Bob', we've already got a great name _ it's
American!''

GERGEN ON BEING A PRESIDENT'S MAN 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MICHAEL KRANISH  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
Eyewitness to Power: The Essence of Leadership, Nixon to Clinton 
By David Gergen 
Simon &AMP; Schuster, 382 pp., $26 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   David Gergen, whose lanky frame and wise counsel have stood
behind four US presidents, was distressed one day in 1983 by a
speech prepared for Ronald Reagan. The speechwriter, a Pulitzer
Prize-winner named Tony Dolan, was much more conservative than the
moderate Gergen, who served as a communication adviser to Reagan.
</P>
<P>
   With Gergen's prodding, the speech to evangelicals in Orlando
was watered down and almost certainly would have been forgotten if
Dolan had not stubbornly insisted on retaining a favorite phrase.
With Gergen ``reluctantly'' agreeing, Reagan went on to deliver
what was arguably the most important sentence of his presidency.
</P>
<P>
   The Soviet Union, Reagan declared in Dolan's words, was an
``Evil Empire.'' It must go. Eventually, of course, it did. Gergen
has since decided Dolan was wise to fight for the phrase.
</P>
<P>
   Words alone, of course, did not tear down the Berlin Wall and
dissolve the Soviet state. But words are Gergen's business, and it
is to his credit that he tells this story on himself in his memoir,
``Eyewitness to Power,'' about serving Presidents Nixon, Ford,
Reagan, and Clinton. As Gergen shows, a cleverly crafted speech and
fine-tuned public relations campaign can at least start to turn the
course of a presidency. What he also shows is that presidents most
often seem to defeat themselves. Nixon had Watergate; Ford had his
Nixon pardon; Reagan had Iran-contra; and Clinton had health
insurance and Monica Lewinsky.
</P>
<P>
   With some exceptions, ``Eyewitness to Power'' is not a
kiss-and-tell memoir, which may disappoint some readers. Anyone
looking for new dirt on Nixon, for example, will not find it in the
chapter titled ``The Bright Side.'' (To wit: Nixon was a visionary
who worked with a Democratic Congress for a moderate domestic
policy, and he opened doors to China). The bright side doesn't
sound so bright, however, as Gergen also repeats many familiar
tales of Nixon's faults, which lose little of their sting after all
these years.
</P>
<P>
   The book is at its best when it comes to Gergen's close-up view
of President Clinton. Gergen had been a longtime ``FOB'' _ Friend
of Bill _ and voted for the Democrat in 1992. But he never expected
to work for the Clinton White House. Then Clinton, who had suffered
through a disastrous first few months of his presidency, called
Gergen and said, ``I'm in trouble. I need you.''
</P>
<P>
   Gergen arrived with the hope that he could be a bridge to
Republicans on Capitol Hill, but his effort was derailed, in part
by the first lady. Gergen wanted a health insurance compromise that
moderate Republicans could embrace; Hillary Rodham Clinton wanted
her plan, which depended almost wholly on support from Democrats.
The president, stuck in the middle, got into shouting matches with
his wife.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Clintons had talked that way in front of campaign staffs
and even gubernatorial aides for a long time, and their friends
ignored it,'' Gergen writes. ``But the White House is different.
One felt party to a massive violation of his privacy. Later on, one
of the participants told me that this happened frequently. In the
middle of a conversation, she would launch a deadly missile
straight at his heart and just before it hit, the missile would
explode, the shrapnel hitting the staff. He would respond, and
tempers would flare. Get over it, I was told. I never did.''
</P>
<P>
   One night in 1994, the explosion was louder than ever. When talk
of moderating the health insurance plan came up at a meeting, ``the
president exploded . . . his face was flushed with anger.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We can't trust the Republicans and I am not backing down!''
Clinton said. ``We won't compromise.''
</P>
<P>
   Gergen was thunderstruck. ``At 10:22 p.m. tonight, health care
died,'' Gergen recalls thinking. And so it did.
</P>
<P>
   Gergen blames Hillary Clinton as much as Bill. She did not have
the background to develop a massive health insurance plan, and he
did not have the political prestige to pass it. But he succumbed
because, as Gergen writes, ``Does anyone doubt that he wanted to
placate her?''
</P>
<P>
   Gergen had long since left the White House by the time Clinton
had his affair with intern Lewinsky and lied about it. But Gergen
said that given what he knew about Clinton, ``it was not surprising
that he succumbed to the temptation.''
</P>
<P>
   Gergen remains proud of his service to Clinton but saddened by
the waste of the man's promise and intellect. Clinton has the
finest grasp of policy of any president he served, Gergen writes.
Clinton's work for a deficit-reduction package in 1993 helped pave
the way for economic prosperity, Gergen believes.
</P>
<P>
   The greatest frustration of this book is that Gergen mostly
keeps quiet about his strong relationship with Vice President Al
Gore, the Democratic presidential nominee. Gergen met with Gore
every week or so during the year and a half that Gergen served in
the Clinton White House, discussing the world and the White House
privately over ginseng tea. ``No conversations I had over the
eighteen months in the administration were more enlightening,''
Gergen writes.
</P>
<P>
   And what did Gore say? Gergen, perhaps not wanting to upset yet
another potential boss, doesn't enlighten his readers.
</P>
<P>
   Despite that lapse, whoever wins the election in November would
do well to read this book carefully. It is subtitled ``the essence
of leadership,'' but it is filled with warnings about the mistakes
and pitfalls that seem to be repeated by every president. Perhaps
the biggest mistake for an incoming president would be to ignore
what Gergen has seen and learned.

SCANDAL IN THE ARGENTINEAN SENATE

 By TOMAS ELOY MARTINEZ 
 c.2000 New York Times Special Features 
<TEXT>
<P>
   HIGHLAND PARK, N.J. _ Over the last 70 years government crises
in Argentina were not notable so much for the things that happened
as for what was prevented from happening.
</P>
<P>
   Hundreds of allegations and even proven claims of corruption,
influence peddling, bribery and sudden illicit wealth were
reported. But most of those charges ended in nothing.
</P>
<P>
   The impression that guilt goes away with the help of government
power and the passage of time has sown such a skepticism in an
Argentinean society already disgusted with the absence of
accountability, that the advent of political adventurism is now a
real possibility. So, Argentina is a country whose future is
unforeseeable.
</P>
<P>
   Therefore, what might not happen now could be far more serious
than what has happened already: In August a rumor surfaced, and
since been verified, that members of Fernando de la Rua's
government paid a number of senators _ it is believed to be between
six and 15 _ to ensure passage of a labor reform bill that had been
mired in Congress for months.
</P>
<P>
   The president himself appears to be innocent, but the same
cannot be said of his people. The bribery scandal, exposed by daily
newspaper La Nacion, revealed an amazing network of corruption that
has shocked Argentineans.
</P>
<P>
   If De la Rua does not identify those from his office who are
responsible for the bribes, every government institution in the
country, including the presidency itself, will be seriously
impaired. Surveys show faith in the president is still high, but
that confidence could disintegrate in much less time than it took
to build if the president holds back the truth.
</P>
<P>
   Undoubtedly, it will be extremely hard to penetrate the web of
secrecy spun by corrupt senators and their partners and even some
sectors of their parties. But common sense dictates that it is not
impossible for the president to determine where the money came from
to buy the labor reform law, who was responsible for the payouts
and who accepted them.
</P>
<P>
   But, at the same time, if even clean senators remain silent out
of fear of colleagues' revenge or of being smeared by the same
dirt, they too will appear as guilty as the rest.
</P>
<P>
   In the years before military takeovers, corruption was almost
unknown in Argentina. For sure, there was serious mishandling of
public funds, such as the extravagant printing of money in 1889 and
1890 during President Miguel Juarez Celman's administration, but it
didn't involve theft or dishonesty.
</P>
<P>
   After 1930, the idea that power could be assailed not only by
arms but also by greed, became an attraction for the ambitious
elite. In some cases, public office changed from being what it
should be _ public service _ to being a source of benefits that
allowed functionaries to repay favors as well as pay off officials
and friends.
</P>
<P>
   The corrupt are not many in number, but those who pretend not to
see the corruption among their peers and have allowed it to
prosper, through perhaps some misguided sense of solidarity,
constitute the overwhelming majority.
</P>
<P>
   For today's bribery scandal in the nation's senate to finally
come to light, there must have been countless others before,
representing barely the tip of the iceberg.
</P>
<P>
   With the perverting of power, came the perfecting of impunity
and brazen shamelessness.
</P>
<P>
   During the last decade, dozens of alleged cases of corruption
have been exposed by the press, and even by the U.S. Embassy, with
only an occasional public official prosecuted.
</P>
<P>
   The accusation of illegal payoffs to the Swift Corp. in 1991 by
a brother-in-law of President Carlos Menem; the sale of tainted
milk by his former private secretary, Miguel Angel Vicco; money
laundering and the countless suitcases stuffed with money coming
and going through the Ezeiza International Airport (run at the time
by Ibrahim al Ibrahim, the Syrian husband of another of Menem's
in-laws); and the decision to sell the postal service to a company
owned by Alfredo Yabran, a mysterious friend of the government, who
ended up committing suicide in 1988 ...
</P>
<P>
   All these incidents were hushed up with the discreet removal of
the perpetrators after no hearings in any known forum, and with the
explanation from the presidency that the attorney general's office
could not find sufficient evidence to prove the charges.
</P>
<P>
   And, in all, it was the press that lifted the lid off the shady
dealings, not the authorities. The government's inaction or
complicity, together with judicial indifference, has engendered
greater public trust in the press than in the government.
</P>
<P>
   Now, a trend that could be called a media-ization of politics
has developed. A vast number of public officials have turned to the
media for legitimacy and publicity. Thus, the politician who
manages to grab the headlines or appear on prime-time television
most frequently, is seen as the more effective and better
qualified.
</P>
<P>
   This has encumbered the media with the thankless function of
being judge and jury and, in so doing, has degraded the political
system: the press cannot and should not do the job of political
institutions, nor should institutions perform their duties with the
sole intent of impressing the media.
</P>
<P>
   To satisfy readers' appetite for scandal, however, certain
newspapers, in a quest to beat corruption, fail to distinguish
between serious allegations of impropriety and irresponsible,
unfounded accusations.
</P>
<P>
   A cloud of suspicion currently hovers over all government
institutions, prompting the public assumption that ``they are all a
bunch of crooks,'' and that there is no alternative but to accept a
corruption that cannot be beaten.
</P>
<P>
   Bowing to obsessive public opinion, the media is now guilty of
concentrating on today's newest scandal, while already forgetting
yesterday's big story.
</P>
<P>
   So, corruption cases that had only a few weeks earlier gripped
the nation, have faded into nothing. Few are interested now in the
trials of two close Menem associates _ Victor Alderete y Maria
Julia Alsogaray _ test cases to demonstrate that government
functionaries are not all immune to prosecution.
</P>
<P>
   In 1972, a newspaper expose brought into question the integrity
of the U.S. political system, when it revealed illegal government
snooping into opposition party campaign offices at Washington's
Watergate Building. On that occasion, the U.S. Senate appointed a
special commission that, with the help of an independent counsel,
investigated the case and determined the guilt of people close to
President Richard Nixon, and even of the president himself.
</P>
<P>
   Could not Argentina exercise the same power?
</P>
<P>
   Next year, the Argentinean Senate will get a shot of fresh air
when members will be elected for the first time by public ballot,
and not through negotiations with provincial governments and
legislatures as before.
</P>
<P>
   But without a thorough house cleaning, unethical practices from
the past may die hard. The mounting corruption is simply too great.
</P>
<P>
   All that the State fails to clear up will irremediably affect
the future of the government and, above all, the faith of voters
who elected the government on promises of openness and honesty.
</P>
<P>
   What doesn't happen, from hereon in, will be much worse that
what has already happened.

   Q: Who was Betty Crocker?
</P>
<P>
   _ A.M., Fort Worth
</P>
<P>
   A: Betty Crocker was invented by the Washburn Crosby Flour Co.
in 1921 to answer questions from customers about baking.
</P>
<P>
   ``Betty was chosen because it sounded light, cheery, wholesome
and folksy,'' Susan Marks-Kerst writes in Hennepin History
magazine. Crocker's last name was chosen to honor former company
director William G. Crocker.
</P>
<P>
   The character began hosting radio shows in 1924, moved to TV in
the 1950s and writes a syndicated newspaper column today that
appears in 1,000 newspapers. Washburn Crosby merged with several
companies to form General Mills in 1928.

crying in softball. Tuesday night's Olympic gold medal game, won by
the U.S. on a dropped fly ball in extra innings, started a flood
for both teams. For the American women, who lost their air of
invincibility in this tournament but not their prize, and for the
Japanese, who won every game but this one, this was as wrenching as
any World Series, as dramatic as any trumped-up movie scene. ``I
fought for this country the best way I can and that is on the
softball field,'' said Lisa Fernandez, who clouded up during
interviews last week when the U.S. was in the midst of a shocking
three-game losing streak and did it again Tuesday when the

Forget, too, president and judo expert Vladimir Putin. Smirking
about last month's sinking of the nuclear submarine Kursk with 118
sailors aboard during a recent CNN interview isn't likely to
improve his stature. No, for a country desperate to restore its
former greatness and grasping for a unifying symbol, Olympic
wrestler Alexander Karelin _ a.k.a. ``The Experiment'' _ is the
closest thing Russia has to a national hero. Entering the Sydney
Olympics, the 32-year-old Karelin boasts one of the most astounding
records in international sports competition: 12 European
championships, nine world championships and three Olympic gold
medals. The 285-pound, 6-foot-four-inch super heavyweight from
Siberia has not lost a match since 1987. (Nelson, Special to Cox

   PROVISIONAL _ Plans to scrap the provisional admission program
at UT-Austin have raised questions over why the University of Texas
can't say no when it comes to Longhorn wannabes. While colleges
across the country have eliminated their second chance admissions,
UT is likely the last holdout. Some say it's the longheld Texas
belief that graduating from UT is every Texan's right. Others say
it's time UT is realistic about getting a hold on its numbers. The
proposal has sparked lots of debate just as UT System regents are
to consider the plan this month. (Jayson, Austin

   TAX-PENSIONS _ WASHINGTON _ You'll be able to put a lot more

pension reform/tax-cut plan assembled over three years by Reps. Rob
Portman, R-Ohio and Ben Cardin, D-Md. The Clinton administration
would like to see some fine-tuning. But the basic problem is that
the Senate GOP leadership can't find time to consider the bill,
even though it could help many millions of rich and middle-class
Americans, while hurting only a few million working-class
employees. (Mollison, Cox News Service). With Textbox.

   POLIO _ This summer, world health officials - including the CDC
- acknowledged they would not meet an oft-stated goal of ridding
the world of polio by the end of this year. Today, (Sept. 27), many
of those officials leading the fight will join Ted Turner and other
big spenders who are helping to fund the effort, in a ``polio
summit'' to explore why the fight is not being won on time. The NYC
meeting is intended to redirect attention away from the
public-health failure and focus media attention on the last push to
eradicate polio - which WHO hopes to accomplish shortly. To set up
the conference, we take a look at why 15-20 of the 30 countries
which had polio at the end of 1999 still do and ask ``What's taking
so long?'' (McKenna, The Altanta Journal-Constitution)

   CENSUS-POVERTY _ WASHINGTON _ WASHINGTON _ Americans enjoyed
substantial income gains for a record fifth consecutive year in
1999, with inflation-adjusted earnings rising to $40,816 for a
typical family, its highest level since income data were first
recorded in 1967, the Census Bureau reported Tuesday. The strong
economy also drove the poverty rate to its lowest level since 1979
-- with the number of poor people falling by 2.2 million compared
to 1998. The effect of the rolling good times were felt equally by
whites, blacks, Hispanics and other ethnic groups, according to the
income and poverty data. A national story with state inserts.

&HT;     STUDY SAYS GOLD MINE LEAKS THREATEN LAKES, RIVERS 
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 &HT;     By JANE KAY

<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ Thousands of pounds of mercury leaking from
dozens of old gold mines in eastern California's Sierra Nevada
range is contaminating downstream lakes and streams and triggering
health warnings on game fish, the U.S. Geological Survey reported
Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   The warnings concerning tainted fish are the first in
California's historic gold mining regions, including the Sierra and
the Trinity-Klamath Mountains.
</P>
<P>
   A study released by the U.S. Geological Survey found that the
fish in the watersheds of the South Yuba and Bear rivers contained
mercury, a potent neurotoxin that can damage the nervous system in
humans.
</P>
<P>
   The study, conducted in the northwestern Sierra, also located
more than a dozen toxic waste sites at the mines that probably need
cleanup to stop the spread of mercury.
</P>
<P>
   California Environmental Protection Agency officials said Monday
they were helping the affected areas _ Nevada, Placer and Yuba
counties _ to issue public health notifications that would limit
consumption of fish caught in the region.
</P>
<P>
   Tested were fish in five lakes: Camp Far West Reservoir, Lake
Combie, Rollins Lake, Scotts Flat Reservoir and Englebright Lake.
Also tested were water, sediments and aquatic life in 14 streams,
including Deer Creek, a main waterway in the Bear River watershed.
</P>
<P>
   ``Right now, we're recommending that everyone limit their
consumption of bass to one meal per month, particularly pregnant
women and children under 6,'' said Allan Hirsch, spokesman for the
state EPA's Office of Environmental Health Hazard Assessment.
</P>
<P>
   Hirsch added that people should limit consumption of other fish
species such as channel catfish, crappie, green sunfish, bluegill,
brown trout and rainbow trout, to one meal per week.
</P>
<P>
   The data still are relatively sparse, Hirsch said, ``but we felt
there was still enough information on mercury that we should
recommend some prudent consumption limits.''
</P>
<P>
   U.S. Geological Survey scientists gave the test results to the
state EPA in August. After reviewing for several weeks, the state
agency asked for more study. The U.S. Geological Survey made the
study public Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   It was not the first startling find of mercury contamination in
the state. By 1999, California had issued warnings for 12 bodies of
water, including San Francisco Bay and the delta formed by the
Sacramento and San Joaquin rivers.
</P>
<P>
   Of 2,506 advisories against consuming wildlife in the United
States, 1,931 were for mercury. Forty states have issued advisories
for mercury.
</P>
<P>
   Warnings are strictest for the most sensitive populations:
children, pregnant women, nursing mothers and women of
child-bearing age. Mercury _ particularly in the organic form of
methyl mercury _ can cause damage to the nervous system, including
impairing mental and physical development.

</P>
<P>
   Charles Alpers, a U.S. Geological Survey research chemist and
the chief scientist on the study, said there are many lakes in the
Sierra that have not yet been sampled but where gold had been
mined.
</P>
<P>
   At risk are lakes between the elevations of 2,000 and 6,000
feet, he said. Lake Tahoe, at 7,000 feet, and other high lakes are
above the former gold mines, Alpers said.
</P>
<P>
   Eventually, the mercury from hundreds of abandoned mine tunnels
ends up in the Sacramento River by way of the Lower Feather River.
</P>
<P>
   While the test results are showing problems for fish and
wildlife, they haven't shown mercury at high enough levels in these
big rivers _ or their larger tributaries _ to contaminate drinking
water.
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. Geological Survey, Alpers said, is advising the Bureau
of Land Management and the U.S. Forest Service where to clean up
mines on federal land that might be polluting the water.
</P>
<P>
   Miners used the mercury _ or quicksilver _ to separate out gold
at hundreds of mines in the Sierra Nevada from the 1850s through
the early 1900s.
</P>
<P>
   In California, most of the mercury pollution comes from the
hydraulic and dredging methods used until 1884. With high-pressure
water, the miners stripped the ground of soil, sand and gravel
above the bedrock. Slurries of water and sediment coursed through

   OLY-SOFT-GEORGE 27 _ BLACKTOWN, New South Wales _ There is
crying in softball. Tuesday night's Olympic gold medal game, won by
the U.S. on a dropped fly ball in extra innings, started a flood
for both teams. For the American women, who lost their air of
invincibility in this tournament but not their prize, and for the
Japanese, who won every game but this one, this was as wrenching as
any World Series, as dramatic as any trumped-up movie scene. ``I
fought for this country the best way I can and that is on the
softball field,'' said Lisa Fernandez, who clouded up during
interviews last week when the U.S. was in the midst of a shocking
three-game losing streak and did it again Tuesday when the
four-year mission to repeat as Olympic champions had reached it

Forget, too, president and judo expert Vladimir Putin. Smirking
about last month's sinking of the nuclear submarine Kursk with 118
sailors aboard during a recent CNN interview isn't likely to
improve his stature. No, for a country desperate to restore its
former greatness and grasping for a unifying symbol, Olympic
wrestler Alexander Karelin _ a.k.a. ``The Experiment'' _ is the
closest thing Russia has to a national hero. Entering the Sydney
Olympics, the 32-year-old Karelin boasts one of the most astounding
records in international sports competition: 12 European
championships, nine world championships and three Olympic gold
medals. The 285-pound, 6-foot-four-inch super heavyweight from
Siberia has not lost a match since 1987. (Nelson, Special to Cox

   PROVISIONAL _ Plans to scrap the provisional admission program
at UT-Austin have raised questions over why the University of Texas
can't say no when it comes to Longhorn wannabes. While colleges
across the country have eliminated their second chance admissions,
UT is likely the last holdout. Some say it's the longheld Texas
belief that graduating from UT is every Texan's right. Others say
it's time UT is realistic about getting a hold on its numbers. The
proposal has sparked lots of debate just as UT System regents are
to consider the plan this month. (Jayson, Austin

   TAX-PENSIONS _ WASHINGTON _ You'll be able to put a lot more
money into your tax-protected IRA or 401(k) retirement savings
account, if the Senate can get its act together in the next two
weeks. Twice, the House has voted overwhelmingly for the bipartisan
pension reform/tax-cut plan assembled over three years by Reps. Rob
Portman, R-Ohio and Ben Cardin, D-Md. The Clinton administration
would like to see some fine-tuning. But the basic problem is that
the Senate GOP leadership can't find time to consider the bill,
even though it could help many millions of rich and middle-class
Americans, while hurting only a few million working-class
employees. (Mollison, Cox News Service). With Textbox.

   POLIO _ This summer, world health officials - including the CDC
- acknowledged they would not meet an oft-stated goal of ridding
the world of polio by the end of this year. Today, (Sept. 27), many
of those officials leading the fight will join Ted Turner and other
big spenders who are helping to fund the effort, in a ``polio
summit'' to explore why the fight is not being won on time. The NYC
meeting is intended to redirect attention away from the
public-health failure and focus media attention on the last push to
eradicate polio - which WHO hopes to accomplish shortly. To set up
the conference, we take a look at why 15-20 of the 30 countries
which had polio at the end of 1999 still do and ask ``What's taking
so long?'' (McKenna, The Altanta Journal-Constitution)

   CENSUS-POVERTY _ WASHINGTON _ WASHINGTON _ Americans enjoyed
substantial income gains for a record fifth consecutive year in
1999, with inflation-adjusted earnings rising to $40,816 for a
typical family, its highest level since income data were first
recorded in 1967, the Census Bureau reported Tuesday. The strong
economy also drove the poverty rate to its lowest level since 1979
-- with the number of poor people falling by 2.2 million compared
to 1998. The effect of the rolling good times were felt equally by
whites, blacks, Hispanics and other ethnic groups, according to the
income and poverty data. A national story with state inserts.

SAN FRANCISCO _  POP FOOD  _ At the start of the 21st century, when
more people than ever eat out, the restaurant has become a
pop-culture icon. Not only are chefs the new rock stars, but tales
from behind the swinging kitchen doors are obsessing people who a
decade ago couldn't have cared less about their waiter's opinion on
child-rearing or how a chef kicked a drug habit. &HT;    With 2 sidebars.

 The Roving Feast: The Prince of Wales Grows a Very Fine Turnip  By Marlena Spieler  
 c. 2000 The San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
 &UR;  &QL;  &LR; 
 &UR; LONDON _  &LR; Last spring, as one of the contributors to BBC Radio 4's
``Food Programme,'' I was invited to the first annual Food
Programme Awards. It was an emphatically feel-good event, where
food media folk met organic farmers and organizers of community
food projects, all of us drinking Champagne and nibbling canapes in
St. James Palace, rubbing shoulders with His Royal Highness Prince
Charles and snagging those little lamb sausages as the tray glided
by.
<P>
   There were shepherds, cheesemakers, gardeners, people rescuing
heritage seeds such as ancient apple varieties in the Thames Valley
(there is a whole charity devoted to the cause) and winemakers.
</P>
<P>
   The venue was like a dream, of course _ a real palace, real
servants (lots of them), red drapes, red carpets and big carved
chairs that looked like . . well, like thrones _ they really did.
There was a lot of red flocking on the walls, and chandeliers
hanging on swags.
</P>
<P>
   The walls were decorated with portraits of ancestors _ former
kings and queens, and their dogs and their horses. This is not the
sort of thing we have in our home _ my ancestors were too busy
fleeing the Cossacks to have portraits painted of their horses.
Anyhow, who had a horse?
</P>
<P>
   If you're like me, you'll want to know the canape menu _ lamb
sausage chunks with artisan-made chutney; Mediterranean vegetable
tartlets; crisp crostini with shrimp; goat cheese and sun-dried
tomato tidbits; baby scones with Devon cream and jam; and _ what's
this? _ chocolate brownies! Naturally, I popped a few of St. James'
finest right into my purse. How often does one get a doggie bag
from the Palace?
</P>
<P>
   A marvelous time was had by all, the whole BBC gang, the award
nominees . . and Prince Charles was as nice as can be. So, when
several months had passed, and I received an invite from The
Prince's Duchy Originals, part of The Duchy of Cornwall, to visit
Highgrove, HRH's organic farm in Gloucestershire, I RSVPed pronto.
</P>
<P>
   Having grown up in Northern California with organic gardening in
the ether, Highgrove was almost a full circle _ a serious business
of growing vegetables, grains and animals and marketing the results
really deliciously.
</P>
<P>
   It's the delicious part of that last sentence that appeals to
me. What is the point of growing anything, and packaging anything,
organically or not, if it is not well grown and delicious?
</P>
<P>
   I am a sucker for good food, and I want my food grown and
produced (as much as possible) by people who enjoy their work in
life _ the likes of many of the Northern California farmers,
ranchers and the like profiled in the Food Section's At the Source
columns.
</P>
<P>
   Farm manager David Wilson took us tromping around the fields,
from oats to rye, potatoes to carrots, and charmed us completely
with his real love of the country. At one point we stood in the
middle of the herd of cows, and just stood there, listening to them
chew. (I do this sort of thing myself, whenever I have a chance.)
</P>
<P>
   Highgrove, despite its connections in high places, is a working
farm, not a bijou little showpiece. They even sell fruit and
vegetables in the local farmers' markets. It might be unlikely to
find HRH standing there selling you a turnip, but it is not
impossible. Highgrove even has a sustainable Vegetable Box Scheme:
each week Highgrove can send you a box of vegetables in season,
though unfortunately you do need to live in the area.
</P>
<P>
   The thing that continues to impress me is that here is a person,
famous and rich, born into a position of incredible privilege who
could choose to do almost anything _ and he has chosen to grow (and
market) organic food. HRH is very involved in each step of the
business _ from sampling and developing products and deciding which
crops to plant, to interviewing prospective employees. One
applicant told me, ``Being interviewed for a job is alarming
enough. I thought I'd faint when I walked through the door and
there was the heir to the throne!''
</P>
<P>
   Duchy Originals was established to create products made from the
raw ingredients grown at Highgrove, HRH's home and farm. They're
sold at many Northern California markets, including Whole Foods in
San Francisco, Berkeley, Mill Valley, Palo Alto, and several other
Bay Area locations; Wild Oats in Berkeley, Sacramento, San Anselmo
and Sunnyvale; and Berkeley Bowl. The goodies are all organic,
quite delicious and traditional, such as my favorite, oatcakes _
rich and crumbly and tasting of oats. To those who are uninitiated,
an oatcake is like an oaty cracker, but made from oats. They are at
their best when eaten with a chunk of really good cheese and
chutney.
</P>
<P>
   Other products _ some available only in Britain _ include
organic bacon from their pigs, crusty sourdough bread from their
wheat, beer from their barley. From ingredients further afield,
there's thin bittersweet chocolate wafers and a drink called Lemon
Refresher _ a slightly bitter very lemony soda, something like a
grown-up 7UP.
</P>
<P>
   Lemon Refresher is said to be a favorite of The Royals,
especially the late Lord Mountbatten. It's good with classic Pimms,
but I adored the tall glasses of fruity red refreshment we were
served at Highgrove _ a Duchy Cocktail, red with strawberries and
heady with Campari and gin. We drank glasses of this gorgeous stuff
as we lolled on the terrace enjoying the sun and _ British weather
being what it is _ dodging the rain. We ate our way through the
table, from the bacon to the sourdough bread, leafy salads and
homemade chutney, fresh mayonnaise and cold ham.
</P>
<P>
   We ate and ate and ate; then we drank some more cocktail and
stumbled, I mean wandered, around the gardens. Before I left, I dug
up a cache of earthy fresh organic potatoes for ``VegTalk,'' the
BBC radio program I was scheduled to do later that week. A few days
later, I cooked them up on the radio, in a way that I'm sure Prince
Charles hadn't thought of. Yet.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
DUCHY COCKTAIL
</P>
<P>
   Red and fresh and tangy and bitter-sweet, this is a marvelous
warm-weather drink. It's not too alcoholic, and is very refreshing.
The amounts are adjustable, according to your taste. Do make it at
the last minute, though, so it will keep its freshness and fizz.
</P>
<P>
   Ingredients:
</P>
<P>
   1 (750 ml) bottle of Lemon Refresher (see Note)
</P>
<P>
   2/3 cup gin
</P>
<P>
   1/2 cup Campari
</P>
<P>
   1 basket of strawberries, hulled and lightly mashed so there are
lots of pieces and lots of juice
</P>
<P>
   Lots of ice
</P>
<P>
   Sprigs of mint
</P>
<P>
   Instructions:
</P>
<P>
   &LR;   &LR;  Pour the Lemon Refresher into a pitcher then pour in the gin
and Campari.
</P>
<P>
   Next, add the strawberries, which will fizz a surprisingly large
amount then subside. Add the ice to the pitcher and garnish with
mint. Drink right away.
</P>
<P>
   Serves 4 to 6.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Note: &LR;  Lemon Refresher, the Royals' favorite drink, is marketed
by Duchy Originals, and is available at Andronico's, Whole Foods,
Wild Oats and Berkeley Bowl. If you can't find it, use any not too
sweet, very lemony carbonated drink.

 &LR; MEXICAN MASHED HIGHGROVE POTATOES
</P>
<P>
   In the control room at the BBC, we ate this with spoons from a
communal bowl. Being radio, of course, no one could see us. It
makes a terrific side dish for a barbecue, picnic, Mexican-inspired
menu or a simple roast chicken. Highgrove potatoes, by the way, are
all-purpose potatoes, somewhere between a mealy baking type and a
waxy variety.
</P>
<P>
   Ingredients:
</P>
<P>
   2 poblano chiles, or 1 Anaheim chile + 1 green bell pepper
</P>
<P>
   3 to 4 pounds potatoes, whichever are your favorites for mashing
</P>
<P>
   1/2 teaspoon salt + salt, to taste
</P>
<P>
   1/4 teaspoon sugar
</P>
<P>
   10 cooked tomatillos, chopped, or several tablespoons very mild
green salsa (optional)
</P>
<P>
   5 garlic cloves, minced
</P>
<P>
   5 to 6 tablespoons extra virgin olive oil
</P>
<P>
   1/4 teaspoon ground cumin
</P>
<P>
   2 to 4 tablespoons sour cream
</P>
<P>
   Juice of 1/2 lime (more if you don't use tomatillos)
</P>
<P>
   3 to 4 tablespoons chopped cilantro
</P>
<P>
   Pepper, to taste
</P>
<P>
   Instructions:
</P>
<P>
   Roast the peppers over a gas burner until the skins char. Place
in a plastic bag and seal well. Set aside for at least 30 minutes.
Remove the peppers and peel them. Cut off the stems, slice the
peppers open and scrape out the seeds. Coarsely chop the flesh and
set aside.
</P>
<P>
   Rinse the potatoes, peel if desired, then cut into chunks. Put
the potatoes into a saucepan and add water to cover, along with 1/2
teaspoon salt and the sugar (it doesn't make the potatoes taste
sweet, but brings out their flavor. It will get drained, as well).
</P>
<P>
   Cook over medium-high heat until the potatoes are just tender.
Drain and transfer to a bowl. Mash the potatoes coarsely, then
blend in the tomatillos, garlic, olive oil, roasted chiles, cumin,
sour cream, lime juice and cilantro. Season with salt and pepper.

 Cook's Books: Two Choices for the Jewish Holiday Table  &HT;       
 By Miriam Morgan 
 &HT;     c. 2000 The San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
 &UR;  &QL;  &LR; 
 &UR; SAN FRANCISCO _  &LR; Just in time for the Jewish High Holidays _ they
begin at sundown Friday with Rosh Hashanah and end at sundown Oct.
9 with the conclusion of Yom Kippur _ I was delighted to see a new
cookbook that promised a fresh approach to traditional holiday
meals.
<P>
   ``Healthy Jewish Cooking'' _ I couldn't help but be intrigued.
After all, much of Jewish food is renowned for its high fat
content. Silky chopped liver, puffy cheese blintzes, feathery matzo
balls _ these get much of their appeal from hefty doses of
 &LR; schmaltz  &LR; (rendered chicken fat), butterfat and the like. If
there's a way to reduce some of the calories and cholesterol yet
still maintain flavor, great.
</P>
<P>
   The book's author, Steven Raichlen, certainly has the
credentials to do it. Raichlen has won two James Beard Awards for
his books, numbering 20 and often focusing on the ``High Flavor,
Low Fat'' theme. His approach is solid, based on using cooking
techniques like roasting and grilling, eliminating egg yolks
whenever possible, using low-fat dairy products, and substituting
broth for fat to moisten and bind.
</P>
<P>
   The methods make sense, and the recipes that use them are simple
to follow. Unfortunately, the results can be disappointing.
</P>
<P>
   Take potato kugel, for example _ ``Jewish soul food,'' Raichlen
rightly calls it. The best versions of this potato casserole _
which is essentially potato  &LR; latke &LR;  (pancake) batter spooned into a
dish and baked _ are crispy outside, velvety inside, with a perfect
potato-onion balance. All this is usually achieved by a good dollop
of  &LR; schmaltz  &LR; and  &LR; gribenes &LR;  _ chicken skin cracklings and onions
cooked in the rendered fat.
</P>
<P>
   Raichlen's version calls for Yukon Gold potatoes, which have a
buttery flavor and relatively creamy texture on their own. They're
grated and mixed with sauteed onions and garlic, along with chopped
parsley and celery leaves. Baking powder gives some lift and egg
whites (and one yolk) some glue. Vegetable cooking oil spray mists
the surface to crisp it.
</P>
<P>
   It's all well and good, but it's not potato kugel. The casserole
has little of the  &LR; tam &LR;  _ a Yiddish word roughly meaning depth and
soul _ that's the essence of the dish.
</P>
<P>
   The brisket to go with it _ the entree for a typical Rosh
Hashanah dinner _ is better, but not wonderful. Brisket needs to
cook a long time and then be cut into thin slices, which is easiest
to do when it's cool. For those reasons, it's best to cook it early
in the day or the day before, slice it and then reheat the slices
in the braising juices.
</P>
<P>
   Raichlen proposes a two-step cooking method, where the brisket
is taken out halfway through cooking, sliced while it's still firm,
then the slices put back in the roasting pan and braised until
done. It's a messy procedure, but OK if you can't cook ahead. The
seasonings _ dried fruit and sweet Concord wine _ are pleasant
enough but don't have the character to stand up to the beefy
flavors.
</P>
<P>
   The brisket recipe, like all those in the book, comes with a
nutritional analysis. Raichlen specifies removing all visible fat
from the brisket and skimming any fat from the juices before
serving, and maybe that's how the analysis can list just 469
calories per serving. The Chronicle's analysis, done with the ESHA
program used for all Food Section recipes, comes up with a more
realistic 578 calories per serving.
</P>
<P>
   In fairness, many of Raichlen's other recipes are naturally
lower in fat and require less tinkering, especially those from the
Sephardic tradition. They use Mediterranean ingredients and pungent
spices and just aren't as rich as the Ashkenazic dishes _ those
from Eastern Europe _ that make up the dominant strain of Jewish
cooking in the U.S.
</P>
<P>
   ``Healthy Jewish Cooking'' is a noble effort, and for those with
serious health concerns it may be fine. Otherwise, better to have
the real thing and just less of it.
</P>
<P>
   For my own holiday meals, I'll probably turn to a book that
arrived just at press time _ ``1,000 Jewish Recipes,'' by prolific
author Faye Levy. A much more ambitious work than Raichlen's, it
includes traditional as well as contemporary Ashkenazic and
Sephardic dishes. It's a promising-looking compendium from an
expert in Jewish cooking.

 &LR; HOLIDAY BRISKET WITH DRIED FRUITS &AMP; SWEET WINE
</P>
<P>
   Ingredients:
</P>
<P>
   One 3-pound brisket, trimmed of all visible fat
</P>
<P>
   Salt and freshly ground pepper, to taste
</P>
<P>
   11/2 tablespoons canola oil
</P>
<P>
   1 large onion, finely chopped
</P>
<P>
   2 carrots, finely chopped
</P>
<P>
   2 celery stalks, finely chopped
</P>
<P>
   2 garlic cloves, finely chopped
</P>
<P>
   1/4 cup chopped parsley (preferably flat-leaf)
</P>
<P>
   11/2 cups Concord grape wine
</P>
<P>
   21/2 cups beef or chicken broth or water, or as needed
</P>
<P>
   2 bay leaves
</P>
<P>
   11/2 cups dried apricots (8 ounces)
</P>
<P>
   11/2 cups pitted prunes
</P>
<P>
   1 cup golden raisins
</P>
<P>
   Instructions:
</P>
<P>
   Preheat the oven to 350 degrees.
</P>
<P>
   Lightly score the brisket on both sides in a cross-hatch pattern
using a sharp knife. Season the brisket all over with salt and
pepper.
</P>
<P>
   Heat the oil in a nonstick frying pan. Add the onion, carrots,
celery, garlic and 3 tablespoons of the chopped parsley and cook
over medium heat until lightly browned, about 5 minutes.
</P>
<P>
   Spoon half of the vegetable mixture into a roasting pan or deep
baking dish just large enough to hold the brisket. Lay the brisket
on top and spoon the remaining vegetables over it. Add the wine,
broth and bay leaves. Tightly cover the pan and bake the brisket
for 11/2 hours.
</P>
<P>
   Transfer the brisket to a cutting board and thinly slice it
across the grain. Stir half of the dried fruit into the roasting
pan juices. Lay the sliced brisket on top. Arrange the remaining
dried fruit on top. Season with salt and pepper. Add broth as
needed to cover the meat and fruit.
</P>
<P>
   Cover the pan and place it back in the oven. Continue baking the
brisket until the meat is tender enough to cut with a fork, an
additional 11/2 to 2 hours. Add broth or water as needed to keep
the meat and fruit moist. If there's too much cooking liquid,
uncover the pan the last 30 minutes to allow some of it to
evaporate.
</P>
<P>
   Transfer the brisket to a platter. Using a slotted spoon,
transfer the fruit to the platter around the meat. Discard the bay
leaves. Pour the pan juices into the sort of gravy boat that allows
you to pour the broth off from the bottom, leaving the fat on top.
If you don't have one of these, pour the gravy into a bowl or
measuring cup and skim the fat off the top with a ladle. Spoon some
of the gravy over the meat and fruit, serving the rest on the side.
Sprinkle the remaining 1 tablespoon chopped parsley over the meat
and serve at once.
</P>
<P>
   Serves 8.

 Wine Potpourri: Vertical Tasting Proves a Study in Development  By Gerald D. Boyd  
 c. 2000 The San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
 &UR;  &QL;  &LR; 
 &UR; SAN FRANCISCO _  &LR; In wine-tasting circles, you hear a lot of talk
about vertical and horizontal tastings. The former compares one
wine from a number of successive vintages, while the latter allows
tasters to evaluate one type of wine from the same vintage but from
different producers. It's the wine version of the games people
play.
<P>
   There is a tendency among some people to turn these tastings
into beauty contests, pitting one wine or wine type against
another. It's a difficult, if not impossible, exercise comparing
wines that, as the Aussies might say, are as different as chalk and
cheese.
</P>
<P>
   At Niebaum-Coppola's recent 25th anniversary tasting of 12
Cabernet Sauvignon-based wines from 1985 and 1995 _ both considered
excellent vintages _ winemaker Scott McLeod made it clear that the
aim was to see how advances in winemaking and grape growing, added
to changes in the wineries themselves, may have altered the styles
of the wine. For each year, there were six Napa Valley wines and
six Bordeaux wines.
</P>
<P>
   We began by tasting the '85s, knowing the identity of each wine.
But for the '95s, younger and less likely to show their identity or
heritage, McLeod and Larry Stone, sommelier for Rubicon, a San
Francisco restaurant in which Coppola is involved, wisely decided
to taste ``blind.'' Sometimes I worry about the use of that term,
because it once described someone in his cups, as it were. But for
wine tasters, tasting ``blind'' means that the tasting is done
without knowing the identity of the wines until the end of the
tasting.
</P>
<P>
   Assessing noticeable changes in the wines due to winemaking or
vineyard practices was difficult, but I thought all showed a
freshness beyond the fact that they were younger than the 1985s. As
a group, the wines had consistently deep colors, very ripe fruit _
a factor, no doubt, of the ripe vintage in both locations _ and an
attractive layering of concentrated flavors. These are wines that
drink nicely now, but will offer even more to the patient.
</P>
<P>
   It was not easy to pick a favorite, but of the 1995 Napa Valley
wines, I liked the Stag's Leap Wine Cellars Cask 23, Phelps
Insignia, Chateau Montelena and Neibaum-Coppola Rubicon. My
favorite Bordeaux of the group were Chateau Pichon-Lalande, Chateau
Margaux and Chateau Lafite Rothschild.
</P>
<P>
   The two '95s that generated the most fervent support and mild
indifference (not dislike) were Chateau Haut-Brion and Heitz
Cellars Trailside Vineyard _ the Heitz only because it was a
different wine from the '85 Heitz Martha's Vineyard tasted in the
first group and a wine noted for its characteristic eucalyptus
accent that wasn't evident in the Trailside Vineyard wine. Heitz
did not produce a Martha's Vineyard Cabernet Sauvignon in 1995.
Opinions differed on the Haut-Brion because of its style. I liked
the wine, but some tasters felt it was too lean and hard.
</P>
<P>
   While this kind of exercise can be viewed as so much stuffy
esoterica, it did allow serious wine collectors and tasters the
opportunity to see a dozen great wines at two different times a
decade apart.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; New Visitors' Center &LR;
</P>
<P>
   Chateau St. Jean, one of the premier wineries in the scenic
Sonoma Valley, has opened its new Visitor's Center just in time for
the 2000 harvest. The new wine tasting and retail room is at the
center of an elegant garden with terraces and fountains. Beginning
Oct. 1, the Chateau St. Jean Visitor's Center will offer a Wine
Education Program consisting of classes such as Wine 101 and
Blending Seminars.
</P>
<P>
   The Visitor's Center is open daily from 10 a.m. to 6 p.m.
Chateau St, Jean is located at 8555 Sonoma Highway (Highway 12) at
the northern end of Kenwood. For more information, call (707)
833-4134 or log on to  &LR; www.chateaustjean.com &LR; .
</P>
<P>
   &UR; New Malts &LR;
</P>
<P>
   Once the exclusive spirit of Scotland, single-malt whiskies are
now being distilled in New World sites such as Oregon, Nova Scotia
and Alameda. New World and Old World single malts are great holiday
gifts for someone who enjoys a wee dram.
</P>
<P>
   Jorg Rupf, German-born owner of St. George Spirits in Alameda,
has just released his first Single Malt Whisky. Distilled only from
the heart of the spirit run, St. George Spirits Single Malt ($40)
was aged in used Bourbon barrels, French-oak barrels and used port
wine casks. The result is a light-bodied whisky with lovely floral
and citrus accents over toasted oak.
</P>
<P>
   In style, the St. George Spirits Single Malt is more similar to
a Lowland or lighter Highland malt whisky. It is available in
limited quantities at select wine shops at at the distillery, 2900
Main St., Alameda.
</P>
<P>
   Glenmorangie, a single malt whisky from the northern Highlands,
has added an exclusive 21-Year-Old malt called Glenmorangie
Elegance to its extensive line of excellent whiskies. Presented in
a glass decanter, handcrafted by Scotland's leading glassmakers,
Caithness Glass, in Wick, to replicate the distillery's tall
swan-neck stills, Elegance is priced at about $400 and is available
at fine wine shops.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; More Holiday Cheer &LR;
</P>
<P>
   Dolce, from Far Niente Winery in the Napa Valley, is one of the
best late-harvest wines produced in California. Made from
late-picked Semillon and Sauvignon Blanc grapes, the honeyed
dessert wine has been available only in 375ml bottles. Now, in
addition to the 375ml ($75), the 1997 Dolce will be available in
750ml ($150) and magnums ($300). Or, you can buy the three-bottle
set for $640.

THE SOFTER SIDE OF SPRING 
WITH PHOTOS
</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By LINDA GILLAN GRIFFIN 
c. 2000 Houston Chronicle 
NEW YORK _ Showings of spring 2001 women's wear came to a end in a
swirl of girlishness. Even the usually subtle Calvin Klein could
not resist the pull of soft colors and sheer fabrics.
<TEXT>
<P>
   His collection alternates between _ and sometimes mixes _ soft
and crisp, as fabrics range from superfine jersey and tulle to
papery taffeta and radzimir. Colors include violet, plum, coral,
strawberry, petal pink dusty rose, aubergine, banana and lapis,
while neutrals run to buff, fog, asphalt, stucco, oyster and
plaster. Except for plaster, a bright white, all these shades are
softened, almost as if they were washed by the sun.
</P>
<P>
   Klein's piece de resistance comes in bicolored, bateau-neck,
sleeveless dresses and tops, almost athletic in feel, in which he
inserts a wide strip of sheer fabric around the armhole, allowing
it to fall to a deep V down the side bodice. Think of the sheer
fabric as an air vent, although it almost looks like a sheer
T-shirt worn under a jumper.
</P>
<P>
   Blouson shapes are evident in Klein's little taffeta jackets
worn with slim skirts, and although not visible from a distance,
there are micro stripes and shadow plaids.
</P>
<P>
   Separates of metalized calf or silk tissue radzimir suffice for
all but the dressiest evenings, and those are accommodated with
tricolor iridescent satin and silk tulle dresses or pale
sequin-block camisoles and dresses.
</P>
<P>
   Donna Karan nailed down her message of soft graphic stripes even
before her show began, featuring invitations and program notes
sheathed in deep caviar and white pinstripes.
</P>
<P>
   At last abandoning her cramped showroom quarters, she chose a
spacious tent at Bryant Park to show off ensembles that mostly
seemed deep-toned petals or handkerchiefs of sheer gauze or
chiffon. Topped with a structured jacket or coat, the fluttering
skirts give an ambivalent message of strength and femininity for
which Karan has long been known.
</P>
<P>
   There is not much to wear to work in either the Klein or Karan
collections; but for evening, Karan's collages of striped chiffon,
buff and pastel scarf dresses and sunset orange blouson dresses and
slips with diamante trim are like moths drawn to flame.
</P>
<P>
   Former stylists Josh Patner and Bryan Bradley are the designers
behind the Tuleh line, a brightly colorful conglomeration of styles
culled from vintage shops, styles one can imagine on Loretta Young
as she swirled down her staircase in the early years of television.
</P>
<P>
   The showing at Sotheby's lended credibility to the collection,
but heaping on that auction house's large and very expensive
necklaces was distracting on some of the otherwise delicate dresses
and separates.
</P>
<P>
   Tuleh includes lots of ruching, blousing, flutter sleeves, full
sleeves slit up the sides, scarves tied at the waist and bows tied
at portrait necklines. Lime, lavender, red, coral and orange
predominate in graphic, floral and dot prints, with some black
chantilly lace for evening.
</P>
<P>
   One of the prettiest outfits, among the confections such as
black strapless tiers of crystal pleats, is a fuchsia silk dress
with a skirt overlay of lime green beads worked in a lattice design
so that the fuchsia peeks through. Segue into shifts sprinkled with
floral beads and hems of wavy ostrich feathers, and you have the
whole of Tuleh. Short and sweet.
</P>
<P>
   The overwhelming trend from collections here is femininity,
achieved with a variety of means. Soft or fluttery fabrics. Pale
and pastel colors. Skin-baring cuts. Blousons, pleats, A-lines and
draping. And the most telling of accessories _ stiletto sandals.

 The Working Cook: Ragtag Naples Spawns a Jewel of a Pasta Dish  By Tara Duggan  
 c. 2000 The San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
 &UR;  &QL;  &LR; 
 &UR; SAN FRANCISCO _  &LR; When it finally gets warm here and the tomatoes
are ripe, I think of summers in Naples, Italy, where my parents
were stationed at a U.S. Navy base while I was in college.
<P>
   Other people have culinary epiphanies in romantic places like
Provence or Tuscany _ the moment when they first taste good olive
oil, for example, and almost faint with the realization of what
they'd been missing all their lives. We had ours in the port town
that most Italians _ other than the Neapolitans, who adore their
city _ consider the nation's armpit, although it has undergone a
renovation of sorts during the last couple of years.
</P>
<P>
   Down-trodden, crowded, lawless, beautiful Naples. We loved it
with a passion, and what we wouldn't do to go back there and eat
dinner outside in the cooler hours of the evening, looking out at
Mt. Vesuvius curve over the gorgeous, albeit polluted, bay.
</P>
<P>
   In Naples, you have culinary epiphanies in the most unexpected
places. For a summer job, I waitressed at a restaurant on the base,
where we served breaded shrimp and defrosted steaks to homesick
Americans and Brits. Sometimes, toward the end of the night, the
Neapolitan cooks, dismayed by our lame attempt at cuisine, would
gather money and send someone out to buy tomatoes and mussels.
After service, we happily slurped up their creation _ spaghetti
studded with chunks of sweet ripe tomatoes and tender, briny
bivalves.
</P>
<P>
   There isn't much else involved in this quintessential Neapolitan
dish other than a generous dose of olive oil, garlic and a sprinkle
of parsley. The main issue is dealing with the mussels, which have
to be super fresh. Some stores sell them debearded, which means
they could be over the hill (they die soon after debearding). It's
usually better to scrub and beard them yourself, though that takes
an additional 20 minutes or so.
</P>
<P>
   Today's other Working Cook recipes have nothing to do with
Naples. Cantonese-Style Turkey, Bok Choy &AMP; Shiitakes is for those
who like mild-tasting Chinese food. The simple formula for this
dish is based on my studies with Rhoda Yee at the California
Culinary Academy, who enlightens her students about the fresh and
light food that's popular in Southern China.
</P>
<P>
   Tortilla Soup with Sweet Corn has the warm-weather flavors of
lime, corn and green chiles. When saving leftovers, freeze the soup
only and add fresh chips and cilantro after reheating.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
FAST &AMP; FRESH: dinner in about 20 minutes
</P>
<P>
   CANTONESE-STYLE TURKEY, BOK CHOY &AMP; SHIITAKES
</P>
<P>
   Many markets carry boneless, skinless turkey tenderloins. If you
can't find them, however, you may substitute chicken breasts. Serve
with steamed jasmine rice.
</P>
<P>
   Ingredients:
</P>
<P>
   1/2 teaspoon cornstarch
</P>
<P>
   1/4 teaspoon Asian sesame oil
</P>
<P>
   2 teaspoons soy sauce
</P>
<P>
   Salt, to taste
</P>
<P>
   1 pound boneless skinless turkey breast tenderloin
</P>
<P>
   1 pound bok choy
</P>
<P>
   1/4 pound fresh shiitake mushrooms
</P>
<P>
   2 garlic cloves
</P>
<P>
   2 one-inch knobs of fresh ginger
</P>
<P>
   4 teaspoons vegetable oil
</P>
<P>
   1/2 teaspoon sugar
</P>
<P>
   2 tablespoons water
</P>
<P>
   The Sauce
</P>
<P>
   2 tablespoons water
</P>
<P>
   2 teaspoons cornstarch
</P>
<P>
   2 teaspoons soy sauce
</P>
<P>
   1/4 teaspoon Asian sesame oil
</P>
<P>
   Instructions:
</P>
<P>
   Combine the cornstarch, sesame oil, soy sauce and a sprinkle of
salt in a wide, shallow bowl. Slice the turkey very thinly and add
to the cornstarch mixture, turning the slices to coat them evenly
with the marinade. Set aside.
</P>
<P>
   Cut the bok choy into 1-inch lengths. Stem the shiitakes, then
thinly slice the caps. Smash the garlic cloves and the ginger with
the flat side of a chef's knife. Combine the sauce ingredients and
set aside.
</P>
<P>
   Heat 2 teaspoons of the vegetable oil in a wok or large skillet
over high heat. Add 1 garlic clove and 1 knob of ginger. Stir-fry
for about 1 minute, or until fragrant. Discard the ginger. Add the
bok choy and mushrooms to the wok, stir quickly, sprinkle with
sugar and a little salt, then add the water, cover and let simmer
for 2 minutes, or until the bok choy is just wilted. Remove from
pan.
</P>
<P>
   Add the remaining 2 teaspoons vegetable oil to the wok and place
over high heat. When the oil is hot, add the remaining garlic and
ginger and stir-fry for 1 minute, until fragrant. Discard the
ginger. Add the turkey and stir-fry for 3 or 4 minutes, until just
cooked through. Return the vegetables to the pan and quickly heat
through, then add the sauce. Simmer for about 1 minute, stirring
constantly, until the sauce has thickened.

<P>
   SPAGHETTI WITH MUSSELS &AMP; SUMMER TOMATOES
</P>
<P>
   This dish may also be made with fresh clams instead of mussels,
or a combination of the two.
</P>
<P>
   Ingredients:
</P>
<P>
   4 garlic cloves
</P>
<P>
   1 pound vine-ripened tomatoes
</P>
<P>
   1 pound spaghetti
</P>
<P>
   11/2 pounds mussels, scrubbed and debearded (see Note)
</P>
<P>
   4 tablespoons water
</P>
<P>
   5 tablespoons extra virgin olive oil
</P>
<P>
   3 tablespoons minced Italian parsley
</P>
<P>
   Freshly ground pepper, to taste
</P>
<P>
   Salt, to taste
</P>
<P>
   Instructions:
</P>
<P>
   &LR;   &LR;  Start bringing a large pot of salted water to a boil for the
pasta.
</P>
<P>
   Thinly slice the garlic. Cut the tomatoes in half widthwise and
gently squeeze to remove the seeds, then chop the tomatoes.
</P>
<P>
   Start cooking the pasta to al dente according to package
directions. When done, drain, reserving 1 cup of the cooking water.
</P>
<P>
   Place the mussels in a pot with the 4 tablespoons water and 1
tablespoon of the olive oil. Cover and bring to a boil, then cook
for 1 to 2 minutes, until most of the shells seem to be open. Do
not overcook. Remove from heat; leave covered.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, heat the remaining 3 tablespoons olive oil in a large
skillet over medium-high heat. Add the garlic and saute for about 1
minute, or until fragrant. Add the tomatoes cook for about 2
minutes, or until just heated through.
</P>
<P>
   Add the mussels and their liquid to the tomatoes. Add the pasta
and half of the parsley; toss to combine (if it doesn't all fit in
the skillet, put everything in the pasta pot). Add enough of the
reserved pasta-cooking water to create a brothy sauce; warm over
low heat for 1 to 2 minutes. Season with pepper and salt, if needed
(the mussels provide salt).
</P>
<P>
   Spoon into bowls and top with the remaining parsley.
</P>
<P>
   Serves 4.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Note: &LR;  Before starting, check the mussels and discard any dead
ones (they will have open shells that don't close even when you tap
them together, whereas live mussels will close their shells when
prodded).

   TORTILLA SOUP WITH SWEET CORN
</P>
<P>
   This soup has a slight kick. If you would like to adjust the
heat level, add half of the chiles at the beginning, then add more
to taste about 20 minutes after adding the broth.
</P>
<P>
   Ingredients:
</P>
<P>
   4 chicken legs (about 21/2 pounds)
</P>
<P>
   Salt and freshly ground pepper, to taste
</P>
<P>
   4 tablespoons vegetable oil
</P>
<P>
   1 large onion, chopped
</P>
<P>
   6 garlic cloves, minced
</P>
<P>
   6 serrano chiles, stemmed and thinly sliced (see Note)
</P>
<P>
   1 teaspoon dried oregano, crumbled
</P>
<P>
   8 cups chicken broth
</P>
<P>
   4 cups water
</P>
<P>
   1 cup chopped drained canned tomatoes
</P>
<P>
   2 cans (7 ounces each) diced green chiles
</P>
<P>
   2 bay leaves
</P>
<P>
   Kernels from 2 ears of fresh corn
</P>
<P>
   Juice of 1 lime
</P>
<P>
   8-ounce bag thick, hand-cut, salted tortilla chips (see Note)
</P>
<P>
   Lime wedges for garnish
</P>
<P>
   Finely chopped cilantro for garnish
</P>
<P>
   Instructions:
</P>
<P>
   &LR;   &LR;  Remove the skin and any excess fat from the chicken legs,
then cut each leg in half at the joint. Season the chicken lightly
with salt and pepper.
</P>
<P>
   Heat the oil in a Dutch oven over medium-high heat. Add the
onion and saute for 5 minutes. Add the garlic, chiles and oregano
and saute for 5 minutes. Add the chicken and saute until browned on
both sides.
</P>
<P>
   Add the broth and water and bring to a simmer, stirring to
dislodge the browned bits clinging to the bottom of the pot. Bring
to a boil and add the tomatoes, canned chiles and the bay leaves.
Reduce heat and simmer for about 40 minutes, or until the chicken
meat starts to fall from the bone. Add water as needed to keep the
chicken fully submerged in the liquid.
</P>
<P>
   Remove the chicken from the soup and let cool slightly, then
pick the meat off the bones (discard bones) and cut or tear it into
large bite-size pieces. Skim any fat from the top of the soup.
Return the chicken to the pot, add the corn and heat for 3 to 5
minutes, until the kernels are just cooked through. Add lime juice
to taste (1-2 tablespoons) and adjust the seasoning with salt and
pepper.
</P>
<P>
   Break some of the tortilla chips into bite-size pieces, leaving
the rest whole to pass at the table.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; To serve: &LR;  Place a few broken tortilla chips in each bowl.
Bring the soup to a boil, then ladle some into each bowl. Let sit
for 1 to 2 minutes to let the chips to soften.
</P>
<P>
   Pass bowls of lime wedges and cilantro and a basket of tortilla
chips at the table.
</P>
<P>
   Serves 12.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Note: &LR;  Look for fresh chiles in the produce section of your
supermarket, or go to a Mexican foods market. Serranos are small,
tapered chiles, about 2 inches long, and are dark green to scarlet
when ripe. You may substitute jalapenos _ about 4 of them should
equal the heat of 2 serranos. &QL; 
Use the thickest, best quality tortilla chips you can find _ Casa
Sanchez is a good brand. Do not use Doritos.

 Taster's Choice: Fritos Jalapeno Dip Is the Big Cheese  By Robin Davis  
 c. 2000 The San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
 &UR;  &QL;  &LR; 
 &UR; SAN FRANCISCO _  &LR; With the Olympics, baseball and football all in
full swing, it's a great time for watching sports on television _
and for pulling out favorite snack foods like a big bag of tortilla
chips and some spicy cheese dip.
<P>
   Today's panel tasted six chile-cheese dips from cans and jars.
One emerged as the clear winner, with the other dips receiving
demerits for starchy texture and lack of cheese flavor.
Interestingly, water is the first ingredient listed on the labels
of all the products except the panel's favorite. The top product
has nonfat milk as its first ingredient.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Fritos Jalapeno Cheddar &LR;  (9 ounces, $2.39 at Mollie Stone's)
was the overwhelming favorite, citing creamy texture and cheesy
flavor with a spicy finish. However, many panelists objected to the
neon orange color. Two thought it would be particularly good heated
and poured over a mound of tortilla chips for almost-instant
nachos. Three panelists would buy it; two might buy it.
</P>
<P>
   Rankings dropped dramatically and second place went to
 &UR; Tostitos Salsa Con Queso &LR;  (151/2 ounces, $3.19-$3.39 at many
supermarkets). Some tasters liked the creaminess and spicy finish
(one commented she could taste chile peppers) but others disliked
the starchy quality and bland flavor. One would buy it, one might
buy it and three would not.
</P>
<P>
   Third place was a tie between  &UR; Fritos Chile Cheese &LR;  (103/4
ounces, $2.49 at Safeway) and  &UR; Taco Bell &LR;   &UR; Salsa Con Queso &LR;  (151/2
ounces, $3.39 at Safeway).
</P>
<P>
   Two panelists compared the texture of the Fritos Chile Cheese to
mayonnaise; others thought there was too much bell pepper and an
artificial cheese taste. One might buy it; four would not.
</P>
<P>
   Many panelists thought the Taco Bell dip was too starchy and had
no discernible spiciness. One panelist described it as ``colored
mayonnaise.'' None would buy it.
</P>
<P>
   The panel also tasted Trader Joe's and Padrinos, but they scored
too low to rate.
</P>
<P>
   Panelists were Flo Braker, cookbook author and Chronicle food
columnist; John P. Carroll, cookbook author; Patricia Hart,
dietitian and food consultant; Roland Passot, chef-owner La Folie
in San Francisco and Left Bank in Larkspur and Menlo Park; and Kirk
Webber, chef-owner, Cafe Kati, San Francisco. A perfect score for
any product would be 100. All products are tasted blind.

 Secrets of Success: Goat Cheese Rocks Zax's Fluffy Souffle  By Michael Bauer  
 c. 2000 The San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
 &UR;  &QL;  &LR; 
 &UR; SAN FRANCISCO _  &LR; Back when California cuisine was just emerging,
goat cheese became the lightening rod of ridicule and wisecracks.
<P>
   Today goat cheese has gone mainstream and is about as common as
Gouda; but no dish is as uncommonly good as the Twice-Baked Goat
Cheese Souffle at Zax.
</P>
<P>
   The souffle, which is baked in individual ramekins, then cooled
and baked again right before serving, may be served alone or
surrounded by lightly dressed greens such as arugula. It also
shines with baby spinach dressed with an apple cider vinaigrette,
apples, celery and fennel.
</P>
<P>
   The souffle puffs up again during the second baking. The
textures are seductive: A crisp, toasty exterior gives way to a
light and tangy interior. The recipe was devised by
husband-and-wife team Barbara Mulas and Mark Drazek, who produce
some of the best California-Mediterranean food at their 49-seat
restaurant, which is tucked away in an out-of-the-way location
between North Beach and Fisherman's Wharf. It's an exciting find.
</P>
<P>
   Mulas and Drazek met in 1986 at the California Culinary Academy
during the final weeks of classes and they've been cooking together
ever since, opening their restaurant in 1993.
</P>
<P>
   She has an affinity for savory dishes and creates most of the
appetizers and main courses. He is responsible for the desserts,
including one of the best apple galettes in the Bay Area.
</P>
<P>
   The modern storefront restaurant, decorated in soothing soft
colors, features bright art work and a soffit ceiling that casts a
warm glow over the dining room. It's a quiet, understated backdrop
to their vibrant food. The menu changes often, depending on what
the team can find on daily trips to Monterey Market in Berkeley.
Fortunately, you'll always find the goat cheese souffle on the
menu.
</P>
<P>
   &LR; Zax, 2330 Taylor St. (near Columbus Avenue) San Francisco; &LR; 
 &LR; (415) 563-6266. Dinner Tuesday-Saturday. &LR;
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
SECRETS OF SUCCESS
</P>
<P>
   &UR; _ Cake flour. &LR;  Finer than all-purpose flour, it gives the
Twice-Baked Goat Cheese Souffles their airy, refined texture. Since
the souffles are turned out onto a baking sheet and reheated just
before serving, the flour is the key to the texture.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; _ Breadcrumbs. &LR;  The ramekins are lined with breadcrumbs, which
help give the souffles structure after the first baking. In
addition, the crumbs provide a crunchy coating, which contrasts
dramatically with the soft interior of the souffles.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
TWICE-BAKED GOAT CHEESE SOUFFLE
</P>
<P>
   Ingredients:
</P>
<P>
   3 tablespoons butter + butter for coating ramekins
</P>
<P>
   1 cup dry breadcrumbs
</P>
<P>
   3 tablespoons cake flour
</P>
<P>
   1 cup milk
</P>
<P>
   10 ounces goat cheese
</P>
<P>
   3 egg yolks
</P>
<P>
   Salt and pepper, to taste
</P>
<P>
   1 cup egg whites (about 7 large)
</P>
<P>
   Instructions:
</P>
<P>
   Arrange the rack in the center of the oven and preheat the oven
to 425 degrees.
</P>
<P>
   Butter eight 5-ounce ramekins, making sure to coat them well.
Fill each ramekin with the breadcrumbs then turn them over and tap
out the excess. Reserve any remaining breadcrumbs.
</P>
<P>
   Melt the 3 tablespoons of butter in a stainless-steel saute pan
over medium-high heat. Whisk in the flour and cook for 20 seconds,
whisking constantly.
</P>
<P>
   Whisk in the milk and cook for about 1 minute, whisking
constantly, until the mixture has thickened to the consistency of a
thin pourable pudding.
</P>
<P>
   Crumble 8 ounces of the cheese into a large mixing bowl. Pour
the hot milk mixture over the goat cheese and mix well. Add the egg
yolks and mix again. Season with salt and pepper.
</P>
<P>
   Using an electric mixer with clean dry beaters, beat the egg
whites in a large bowl until stiff peaks form. Fold half of the
whites into the cheese mixture to lighten it. Then gently fold in
the remaining whites.
</P>
<P>
   Divide half of the souffle mixture among the prepared ramekins.
Crumble the remaining 2 ounces of goat cheese and divide among the
ramekins, then top with the remaining souffle mixture, dividing it
equally among the ramekins. Sprinkle the remaining breadcrumbs over
the top.
</P>
<P>

 Fifteen Minutes of Fame: Julia's name will last but what about  the
newest breed of celebrity chefs?  By Kim Severson 
 &HT;     c. 2000 The San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
 &UR;  &QL;  &LR; 
 &UR; SAN FRANCISCO _  &LR; Julia, what have you wrought?
<P>
   When you took up your cleaver and stepped behind the camera in
1962, could you have foreseen that People magazine would choose a
chef as one of the year's most eligible bachelors? That a
restaurant tell-all book would be on the New York Times best-seller
list? That an entire television network would be devoted to food,
featuring the spectacle of Emeril ``Kick it up a Notch'' Lagasse or
hunky Bobby Flay?
</P>
<P>
   At the start of the 21st century, when more people than ever eat
out, the restaurant has become a pop culture icon. Not only are
chefs the new rock stars, but tales from behind the swinging
kitchen doors are obsessing people who a decade ago couldn't have
cared less about their waiter's opinion on child-rearing or how a
chef kicked a drug habit.
</P>
<P>
   Today, the media is jammed with books on the inner workings of
the kitchen, movies about chefs and Web sites devoted to cooking
gossip. What's next? ``Dishwasher: The Musical''?
</P>
<P>
   ``As you get a society more interested in food as art, people
will increasingly be interested in the artists,'' says Bertram
Gordon, a food historian and acting provost at Mills College in
Oakland.
</P>
<P>
   Child believes American's new obsession is a direct reflection
of an American food renaissance. ``You've had so many other people
become celebrities, why not chefs?'' she asks. ``And we have so
many good-looking chefs around now.''
</P>
<P>
   In America, in the year 2000, if you're in the restaurant
business _ whether chef, waiter or reservationist _ you can be a
media hero.
</P>
<P>
   ``My fry man is thinking of getting a publicist,'' jokes New
York chef Anthony Bourdain, author of ``Kitchen Confidential,'' a
raucous trip through his life as a dope fiend, chef and kitchen
pirate.
</P>
<P>
   &LR; sh1  &LR; The New Obsession
</P>
<P>
   To get the full impact of how restaurant-obsessed our culture
has become, consider the arenas in which the professional kitchen
is taking center stage.
</P>
<P>
   _ &UR; Movies &LR; . A couple of months ago, Richard Gere starred as a
restaurateur in love with Winona Ryder in the widely panned
``Autumn in New York.'' Last week saw the opening of ``Woman on
Top'' featuring Penelope Cruz as a heartbroken Brazilian chef who
comes to San Francisco and makes it big as a TV chef. These follow
a decade's worth of great food-based films, including ``Like Water
for Chocolate,'' ``Eat Drink Man Woman'' and ``Big Night.''
</P>
<P>
   &UR; _ Magazines &LR; . People magazine has become the chef's favorite
star vehicle. New York chef Marcus Samuelsson landed on the June 28
cover as one of the nation's 100 most eligible bachelors. In the
Sept. 4 issue, the magazine ran a two-page feature on French chef
Alain Ducasse who opened his eponymous dining room in New York,
America's most expensive restaurant.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; _ Books &LR; . Bourdain's confessional has muscled its way onto
national best-seller lists, while Debra Ginsberg's ``Waiting: The
True Confessions of a Waitress'' is heading for additional
printings. Ginsberg has taped a stint on the new
nationally-syndicated ``To Tell The Truth'' and a segment on CBS
Sunday Morning with Charles Osgood, which will air in November.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; _ Television.  &LR; The 24-hour Food Network, born in 1992 and now
reaches 50 million homes, has made superstars out of otherwise
little-known chefs. Consider that every week more than 150,000
people request one of the 1,500 seats at ``Emeril Live.'' And
Americans have latched on to the network's Japanese cooking show,
``Iron Chef,'' which has had American chefs Ron Siegel of Charles
Nob Hill and Bobby Flay as challenger contestants on the show. Even
Courtney Cox-Arquette's character Monica is a chef on NBC's
``Friends''.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; _ Internet &LR; . The Food Network has the most popular food site on
the Web, with well over a million visitors each month. Other hot
Web sites include the saucy  &LR; ontherails.com &LR; , written by restaurant
employees;  &LR; www.starchefs.com &LR; , a chef's online fan magazine; and
 &LR; www.ifilm.net &LR; , which features goofy food-inspired Internet movies
like ``Pies Wide Shut,'' an R-rated spoof about a pastry chef.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; _ Theater &LR; . ``Fully Committed'' is a one-man show about a
reservationist in a swanky restaurant. It's a hit in New York and
also has enjoyed a wildly successful San Francisco run. (It ends
Oct. 22.) ``Fanny at Chez Panisse,'' a play based on the life of
Alice Water's daughter, opened last week in Berkeley.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; _ Etc. &LR;  If you're still not convinced that the chef has become
the hottest pop culture icon going, add this to the mix: The star
of a current Viagra commercial is a smiling chef overseeing a busy
restaurant.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Eat Out Now &LR;
</P>
<P>
   So why is this happening now? The leading theory is that since
there are more restaurants than ever and a record number of people
are spending more time in them, it's only natural that devotees
want to know more about the inner workings.
</P>
<P>
   San Francisco has some 3,700 restaurants _ about 400 opened in
1999 alone, according to the San Francisco Dept. of Public Health,
which licenses them. Nationally, almost half of all adults eat at
least one meal out a day, according to the National Restaurant
Association.
</P>
<P>
   The public's urge to get behind the scenes is the same one that
fuels the popularity of movie gossip magazines and movie studio
back lot tours.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's just like people being desperately interested in the
secret lives of movie stars and soap opera stars. (Restaurant
workers) have become the major focus of the entertainment life,''
says Bill Wallace, a longtime San Francisco food purveyor and chef
who now works as culinary director for the online company Tavolo.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm an opera lover and theater lover but I go to restaurants
10 times a week. So of course I'm interested in who is putting on
the show,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   Other observers say restaurants offer two things Americans
desire the most _ status and intimacy.
</P>
<P>
   In the same way that being able to get a table in good
restaurant offers status, so does knowing the hottest gossip about
the city's most popular restaurant or chef.
</P>
<P>
   The dining experience also offers intimacy.
</P>
<P>
   ``In a good restaurant you are the star of the evening. Someone
knows you, calls you by your name and you have identity. If you
know the chef, there is this pretend intimacy and you are
somebody,'' says Rose Marie Morse, media agent for ``Kitchen
Confidential.''
</P>
<P>
   Some observers point to the fact that the restaurant experience
can even mirror a relationship. At the beginning, everyone is on
his or her best behavior. The diner and waiter strengthen their
relationship through the ordering process, which brings on a
sensual experience _ eating the food. But then the end comes. One
of you leaves and it ends up costing money.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's really sort of a strange, enforced intimacy. I keep
comparing waiting tables to prostitution,'' says
waitress-turned-author Ginsberg. ``Food is one of these very
essential needs that has to be met but you're also getting this
human interaction. We live in this electronic age where everything
is data. Eating out is personal and intimate.''
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Know It All &LR;
</P>
<P>
   America is more obsessed with food now than 20 years ago.
Although people are eating more convenience and take-out food than
ever before, enrollment in cooking schools, sales at high-end
cookware stores and the variety of goods in grocery stores all
continue to climb.
</P>
<P>
   People may not cook all the time, but they are more
knowledgeable about food. As a result, they're more interested in
the people who cook for a living.
</P>
<P>
   At least, that's one theory.
</P>
<P>
   Balderdash, says Mimi Sheraton, author and former New York Times
restaurant critic. The current fascination with celebrity chefs and
restaurants is merely a bigger version of what came in the 1980s
with nouvelle cuisine and chefs like Wolfgang Puck and Jeremiah
Tower.
</P>
<P>
   The latest craze is not at all about food, she says, but about
celebrity.
</P>
<P>
   ``People have a love of celebrities so they're finding them in
all fields,'' she says. The elevation of chef to star has chefs
working out so they look better, hiring publicists and opening more
restaurants than many can handle, Sheraton says. However, she sees
a fall coming.
</P>
<P>
   `` `They're cruisin' for a bruisin',' as we used to say in
Brooklyn, because it gets to be ludicrous and the most ludicrous
right now is Alain Ducasse. He'll be famous for failing.''
</P>
<P>
   Gordon agrees that the current fascination is an extension of
the celebrity chef craze that hit in the late 1970s and early '80s.
That initial hit is tied directly to the rise of regional cooking _
and in particular California cuisine. But Gordon points out that
the popularity of everyone from Child to the latest Food Network
star parallels the rise of women in positions of power in American
society.
</P>
<P>
   ``The sleeper in all of this is the role women have had,'' he
says. ``Julia Child was successful in large part because her timing
was right. She had a message a lot of people _ women in particular
_ wanted to hear. In the same way, women are creating a culture
around food that's receptive to the kinds of celebrity we see
today.''
</P>
<P>
   &UR; It's the Food, Stupid &LR;
</P>
<P>
   But Child herself worries the public's current fascination with
chefs will give aspiring cooks the wrong impression.
</P>
<P>
   ``In some ways it's difficult for the people who are going to
culinary schools because they all want to have TV shows and be
stars,''' she says. ``It's a 10-year discipline at least. It's
about like trying to be a doctor. You've got to train for many,
many years.''
</P>
<P>
   There was a time, Sheraton points out, when people appreciated
what this training meant, and went to restaurants for the food, not
for the chefs themselves.
</P>
<P>
   In the end, she and others agree, the chef-obsession will fade,
just as it has with other fleeting icons of American pop culture.
The public may not tolerate celebrity on its own, without something
_ great food, in this case _ to back it up.
</P>
<P>
   ``What becomes dangerous,'' Sheraton says, ``is when (chefs)
think they know better than the public, when they forget they are
in the business of serving people food. We went through that in the
'80s. I'm holding my breath because I believe they are going to
make the same mistake again.''

 &UR; The Big Screen Spotlights Chefs and Their Passions &QL;  &LR; 
 &UR; By Laura Perkins &QL;  &LR; 
 &UR; c. 2000 The San Francisco Chronicle &QL;  &LR; 
Food, glorious food. It may be primary and basic, but it's also a
mark of civilization and artistic expression. Here is a short list
of movies featuring restaurants or chefs that use food to explore
passion visually.
</P>
<P>
   _  &UR; Alice Doesn't Live Here Anymore &LR;  (1974). Ellen Burstyn won an
Oscar for her performance as Alice Hyatt, a funny, spirited widow
who takes a job as a waitress to support herself and her son. Alice
is horrified she has to take a job waiting tables at Mel's diner.
But there she gathers courage and self-respect. Diane Ladd is great
as the wise-cracking waitress Flo. The movie inspired the
long-running TV series ``Alice'' that starred Linda Lavin.
</P>
<P>
   _  &UR; Big Night &LR;  (1996). Stanley Tucci and Campbell Scott
co-directed this intimate movie about two Italian immigrant
brothers struggling to make their restaurant a success. Tucci plays
Secondo, a pragmatic entrepreneur, and Tony Shalhoub is Primo, a
brilliant chef who is unwilling to compromise his art. The
brothers' deep, conflicted love is tested when they stage an
elaborate meal thinking trumpeter Louis Prima will visit and help
launch their restaurant.
</P>
<P>
   _  &UR; The Cook, The Thief, His Wife &AMP; Her Lover &LR;  (1989). Director
Peter Greenaway's film is grotesque, horrifying and fascinating.
The stylized fable about love and revenge, civilization and
barbarism is set mainly in an opulent restaurant. We see food in
every stage, from carcass to preparation, fanciful display to
wrecked aftermath. Michael Gambon, the tyrannical thief, holds
court there with Helen Mirren as his wife.
</P>
<P>
   _  &UR; Eat Drink Man Woman &LR;  (1994). Food is at the center of
director Ang Lee's story. Master chef Chu, played by Sihung Lung,
has lost his sense of taste and is losing touch with his three
daughters. A ritualized Sunday night dinner provides a stage for
the family to communicate complicated, tightly held emotions. The
footage of Chu preparing their elaborate meals is tantalizing.
</P>
<P>
   _  &UR; Frankie and Johnny &LR;  (1991). Al Pacino plays Johnny, a
short-order cook who falls in love with Frankie, a waitress played
by Michelle Pfeiffer, in this adaptation of Terrence McNally's
play. The play is set in Frankie's tiny New York City apartment,
but the movie lets us see a kaleidoscope of characters at the
Apollo Cafe. There was a lot of guff at the time about casting
Pfeiffer as a lonely, frumpy woman but she's vulnerable and
believable in the role.
</P>
<P>
   _  &UR; Fried Green Tomatoes &LR;  (1991). This is a quirky, captivating
film that tells two tales of loving relationships. The frame story
is set in the present and focuses on the friendship between Evelyn
Couch and Ninny Threadgoode, played by Kathy Bates and Jessica
Tandy. The central story, set in the 1920s and '30s, is about Idgie
Threadgoode and Ruth Jamison, played by Mary Stuart Masterson and
Mary-Louise Parker. These women create a haven at the Whistle Stop
Cafe.
</P>
<P>
   _  &UR; Who Is Killing the Great Chefs of Europe? &LR;  (1978) This
comedy-mystery directed by Ted Kotcheff opened the San Francisco
International Film Festival in 1978. The late British actor Robert
Morley plays a pompous gourmand, the chief murder suspect as famous
chefs are found dead in comic situations related to their
specialties. Jacqueline Bisset plays a sexy pastry chef and George
Segal is her ex-husband who owns a fast-food franchise called the
Humpty Dumpty Omelette Shops.
</P>
<P>
   &LR;  &QL; 
 &UR; Not Ready for Prime Time: TV Fails to Cast Chefs as Stars &QL;  &LR; 
 &UR; By Scott Clapp &QL;  &LR; 
 &UR; c. 2000 The San Francisco Chronicle &QL;  &LR; 
Kitchens and chefs are popping up everywhere from the Internet to
the New York Times best-seller list (see accompanying story). But
still our hero hasn't shown up as a network star. No prime time
equivalent to ``LA Law,'' ``NYPD'' or ``ER'' for our stove
warriors.
</P>
<P>
   Is Hollywood blind to this cultural tsunami? Where is ``Hill
Street Cafe'' or ``Thomas, the Rabbit Slayer''?
</P>
<P>
   Sure, restaurants and cooks have been central to plots over the
years, but other than ``Alice'' more than 20 years ago and
``Chef!,'' a British sitcom, most are quickly forgotten.
``Nightmare Cafe,'' ``It's a Living'' and ``Tattingers'' were never
even blips on the Nielsen ratings. Most recently, a pizza place
co-starred with two guys and a girl. Sadly, the pizza place took
the blame for poor viewership and was cut after only one season.
</P>
<P>
   Only a few successful shows have had a chef or cook as a major
character _ Mel in ``Alice,'' Monica on ``Friends,'' Nat from
``Beverly Hills 90210'' and Jack on ``Three's Company.''
</P>
<P>
   Occasionally, a cook or chef has made an impact in a one-time or
recuring role. Who can forget the Soup Nazi from ``Seinfeld''?
</P>
<P>
   But with the current fascination with restaurants, a chef or
kitchen is likely to show up soon in our prime-time sitcoms and
dramas. Having practiced law, worked with physicians and spent time
in commercial kitchens, I, for one, can't wait. If writers can make
the fairly mundane day-to-day worlds of law and medicine into
award-winning television series, I'd love to see what they can do
with the kitchen.

&HT;     SPANISH-SPEAKING TEXAS TOWN NOW TARGETS BORDER PATROL 
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 &HT;     By BONNIE PFISTER  
 &HT;     c.2000 San Antonio Express-News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   EL CENIZO, Texas _ A tiny Texas border town that last year
adopted Spanish as its official language has formed a ``truth
commission'' to investigate allegations of human rights abuses by
U.S. Border Patrol agents.
</P>
<P>
   The five-member panel in El Cenizo is about to get its first
formal complaint, from a resident who says a Border Patrol agent
detained him at gunpoint early one morning last week.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think the Border Patrol has taken the people of El
Cenizo very seriously,'' said Jose Salvador Tellez, a Laredo lawyer
and commission member.
</P>
<P>
   Tellez said he had not seen the complaint and that the month-old
commission is still setting up procedures to deal with complaints.
</P>
<P>
   El Cenizo City Councilwoman Flora Barton said the alleged victim
is a legal resident of the United States who works as newspaper
carrier. The man showed up at City Hall on Thursday to say that he
had been detained twice by Border Patrol agents early on Sept. 17.
The agents did not ask for his identification, the man reported,
but one held a gun to his head for several minutes.
</P>
<P>
   John Montoya, a Border Patrol official in Laredo, said Monday
the federal government's independent Office of Inspector General is
looking into the complaint.
</P>
<P>
   El Cenizo, a town of 1,775 people located south of Laredo, found
itself in the national spotlight last year after voting to adopt
Spanish as its official language and barring city employees from
turning in illegal immigrants.
</P>
<P>
   Following the formation of the commission last month, Montoya
said he held a meeting with El Cenizo's elected officials.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of the complaints were the typical things: The agents
are rude, or they're speeding through the neighborhood. I can fix
those things immediately,'' Montoya said.
</P>
<P>
   Montoya said the allegation that an agent used a weapon,
however, is an incident ``separate and apart,'' and it is being
investigated.
</P>
<P>
   For the most part, Montoya said El Cenizo residents seem to want
better communication with the Border Patrol. He supports that.
</P>
<P>
   But the area is of legitimate concern to agents, who in the past
year have seized 5,756 pounds of marijuana in that region. About
1,500 illegal immigrants have been seized in the region in the past
year.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's not a debate about our authority. We are allowed to
patrol any area within the 25-mile border zone. We're not there to
assert our rights under the law but to establish a positive
relationship,'' Montoya said.
</P>
<P>
   Barton helped push for the founding of the truth commission. In
July she helped to found a nongovernmental group, Stand United, to
address the issues of excessive questioning by the Border Patrol.
</P>
<P>
   ``Anywhere you would walk it was stop, stop, stop,'' said the
substitute schoolteacher and nine-year resident of El Cenizo.
Immediately after the commission was founded, the federal agency
put two bike patrol agents into the community to try to foster
better communication.
</P>
<P>
   Until the recent incident, it seemed to be working, Barton said.
But now she says she is apprehensive again.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was feeling hopeful ... then something like this happens. It
pushes you and says, `Wake up!'''

   OLY-DRUGS-ANALYSIS (Sydney) _ As C.J. Hunter, the husband of
Marion Jones seeks to clear his name, the entire system of drug
testing in the United States has come under fire from international
Olympic officials who consider the Americans hypocritical, laggard
and deceptive in their handling of doping cases. U.S. officials are
firing back. The recrimination has symbolized the messy state of
drug testing internationally and the lack of trust and cooperation
that undermines renewed efforts to curb the widespread use of
performance-enhancing drugs. By Jere Longman.

   OLY-BOX (Sydney) _ Tuesday, the Sydney Olympic boxing tournament

   NEW-ENGLAND-FOODS (Westport, Mass.) _ The southern coast of New
England is the source for oysters so fine they are sold by name,
and for wines that are served in some of the leading restaurants in
Boston and New York. One of the best American blue cheeses is made
here, not far from centuries-old apple orchards and farms that are
experimenting with cutting-edge technology in fish farming. In
Westport, they have a plan to preserve their rural coastline and to
make the region as famous for its food and wine as Sonoma County in
California or the Hudson Valley in New York state. By Marian
Burros. (With map)

<P>
   KOSHER-RESTAURANTS (Undated) _ For truly observant Jews, kosher
restaurants were traditionally the only alternative to staying home
or going to grandma's. Now those old-fashioned places have given
way to more modern kosher options _ Chinese, Japanese, Indian,
Mexican and French steakhouses among them. And the newest additions
to the kosher scene are high-end restaurants featuring ambitious
dishes like bison, rack of lamb and whole roasted sea bass, with
wine lists and elegant surroundings. By Alex Witchel. (With photos)

   STREISAND-ARTISTRY (Undated) _ A Critic's Notebook on Barbra
Streisand, who is performing sold-out concerts this week in New
York. By Anthony Tommasini.
</P>
<P>
   HIP-HOP-AUDIENCE (New York) _ The patrons of the Brooklyn
Museum's new exhibit, ``Hip-Hop Nation: Roots, Rhymes and Rage,''
looked markedly different from the museum's typical weekend crowd.
They were younger, and more ethnically diverse, and a striking
proportion of them said they had a personal connection to the
material on display _ whether they were record company executives,
former graffiti writers, young aspiring deejays, or teenagers who
simply said they had never known life without hip-hop. By Nina
Siegal.
</P>
<P>
   PHOTOS-NEW-ACCESS (Undated) _ Two major photography institutions
_ the George Eastman House in Rochester and the International
Center of Photography in New York City _ have entered an alliance
that will give New Yorkers more access to one of the world's
greatest collections of photographs and motion pictures. By
Celestine Bohlen.
</P>
<P>
   CHINA-ROCK-CONCERT (Beijing) _ At the first mega-band rock
concert allowed to grace a stadium in the nation's capital since
the spring of 1989, a horde of bands making up for lost time forced
themselves upon a crowd that, at certain moments, didn't seem to
know what had hit them. By Jonathan Ansfield.
</P>
<P>
   NASHVILLE-SYMPHONY (New York) _ On the Nashville Symphony at
Carnegie Hall. By Allan Kozinn.
</P>
<P>
   IRAN-BOOK-REVIEW (Undated) _ For many Americans, Iran conjures
up the hostage crisis, terrorism, the crowds chanting ``death to
America'' and the fierce Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini denouncing the
United States and Israel. Elaine Sciolino, a New York Times
correspondent, shows a different Iran in ``Persian Mirrors.''
Reviewed by Ira Lapidus.
</P>
<P>
   BROTHER-FILM-REVIEW (Undated) _ It's probably fitting that
Takeshi Kitano goes by the nickname Aniki in his yakuza spectacular
``Brother,'' because he stirs up some serious anarchy on the Los
Angeles crime scene. Reviewed by Elvis Mitchell.
</P>
<P>
   BEST-FILM-REVIEW (Undated) _ If you thought yuppie arrogance and
entitlement had been satirized to death, you haven't met Hamilton
and Meg Swan (Michael Hitchcock and Parker Posey), the hysterically
doting dog owners who have the funniest scenes in Christopher
Guest's dog-show mockumentary, ``Best in Show.'' Reviewed by
Stephen Holden.
</P>
<P>
   TWILIGHT-FILM-REVIEW (Undated) _ With ``Twilight: Los Angeles,''
the documentary and video maker Marc Levin has transformed Anna
Deavere Smith's much-honored performance piece ``Twilight: Los
Angeles, 1992'' into something both more and less than itself.

<TEXT>
<P>
   American novelist Mark Twain once observed, ``In Boston, they
ask, How much does he know? In New York, How much is he worth? In
Philadelphia, Who were his parents?''
</P>
<P>
   This happens to be true. It's not so much that Philadelphians
are snobbish as that they're rooted in history. The past is alive
in Philadelphia in the most tangible way.
</P>
<P>
   In the oldest part of the city, down by the Delaware River, for
instance, 18th-century houses abound and every block _ and
sometimes every house _ has a plaque describing a person who lived
there or a momentous event that took place there.
</P>
<P>
   Even one of Philadelphia's grand old department stores,
Strawbridge &AMP; Clothier at 8th and Market Streets, devotes a front
window (where other stores might show their most enticing
merchandise) to a display stating that Thomas Jefferson once had an
office on that site.
</P>
<P>
   Some twists of fate conspired to make Philadelphia the time
capsule that it is. By the 1770s, Philadelphia was the richest,
most important city in the New World, second only to London in the
amount of trade that moved through its well-protected harbor.
</P>
<P>
   As the United States struggled into being, the Declaration of
Independence and the Constitution were drawn up and ratified in
Pennsylvania's State House, known today as Independence Hall, and
Philadelphia was the nation's first capital from 1790 to 1800.
</P>
<P>
   In Congress Hall _ a two-story, Georgian, brick building which
flanks Independence Hall _ the House of Representatives and the
Senate met for the first time. This is where the Bill of Rights was
drawn up and ratified, and where John Adams was sworn in as the
second president of the United States.
</P>
<P>
   Many prominent Philadelphians hoped that their city would become
the nation's permanent capital and did all they could to make that
prospect enticing, but Adams moved the capital to Washington, D.C.
And so Philadelphia, once the geographic and financial keystone of
the colonies, became peripheral.
</P>
<P>
   The city remained an industrial powerhouse and an important
medical and educational center, but New York became the nation's
financial capital, just as Washington became the country's
political epicenter.
</P>
<P>
   Philadelphia brooded and slept, demoted by the end of the 20th
century to the fourth largest city in the United States.
</P>
<P>
   But diminished importance (and diminished property values) had
unanticipated benefits. Often as much by neglect as by design,
historic buildings were preserved. Today, when people, individually
and in groups, seek their roots, these beautiful buildings are
buffed and prized as never before.
</P>
<P>
   Philadelphia shines _ an endlessly fascinating city where the
ghostly figures of the past hobnob with sophisticates who crowd the
outdoor cafes, the top-notch restaurants and the world-class
cultural attractions. The Philadelphia Museum of Art (N. 26th
Street and Benjamin Franklin Parkway) has one of the most important
permanent collections in the country, while Philadelphia's beloved
Academy of Music, built in 1857 as an opera house and currently
home to the magnificent Philadelphia Orchestra, anchors a stretch
of South Broad Street called the ``Avenue of the Arts'' because of
its many theaters.
</P>
<P>
   However, these attractions are Johnny-come-latelys compared with
Philadelphia's colonial core.
</P>
<P>
   Any first-time visit to Philadelphia should begin with
Independence National Historical Park, an area of roughly 12 blocks
_ bordered by Second and Sixth Streets on the east and west and
Market and Walnut Streets on the north and south.
</P>
<P>
   Justifiably, this has been called the ``most historic square
mile in America.'' Here, you can see the First and Second Banks of
the United States (the latter, an architectural masterpiece),
Franklin Court, where Benjamin Franklin and his family lived,
Christ Church, where Franklin, George Washington and Betsy Ross
worshipped, and many other buildings of historic and architectural
importance.
</P>
<P>
   A Visitors Center at 3rd and Chestnut Streets provides
orientation and a suggested itinerary. Two days would not be too
much to spend here.
</P>
<P>
   The most important monuments, of course, are the Liberty Bell
which once hung in the tower of Independence Hall and which
summoned the people of Philadelphia to hear the first reading of
the Declaration of Independence on July 8, 1776, and Independence
Hall itself.
</P>
<P>
   Here, you can stand in the room where the Declaration was
ratified and the Constitution was discussed and signed. The silver
inkwell that the Founders used to sign the Declaration still
reposes on the desk in the front of the room and George
Washington's chair, with a sun carved into the back, sits behind
it.
</P>
<P>
   On a quiet Sunday morning (before the crowds descend), with the
sun streaming through the tall, broad windows, it's easy to imagine
the discussions that took place here _ and to wonder why these men
of property risked everything, including their lives, to sign the
Declaration.
</P>
<P>
   And then, there are the details recounted in books and by the
Park rangers that bring these long-ago events to life: Caesar
Rodney, for instance, from Delaware, gravely ill, riding through
the night to break a tie in the Delaware delegation and vote for
independence _ or Ben Franklin, so old and sick that he had to be
carried into that room in a sedan chair, bringing his wisdom and
experience and his gift of compromise to the Constitutional
Convention _ and they say, when the time came for him to sign the
Constitution, crying silently.
</P>
<P>
   Across the park from Independence Hall, the Liberty Bell now
resides in a glass pavilion. Millions of people visit it every
year. Some stand quietly. Others photograph it. Parents bring their
children and hold the little ones up so that they can touch the
bell.
</P>
<P>
   In Philadelphia, history is not just an abstraction but an
electrifying force. It lives.

 &HT;    Carl Lewis not going away
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Carl Lewis has been in Sydney for a couple of weeks acting as a
corporate schmoozer, but he pointedly has avoided coming out to
watch the sport he dominated for 15 years. Lewis, who retired after
winning a fourth straight long jump title and ninth gold medal in
1996, said he would go to Olympic Stadium only to watch his friend,
Floyd Heard, later in the week. Maurice Greene, who has taken over
Lewis' role as the world's fastest human as the new Olympic
100-meter champion, feels the man known as King Carl cannot accept
relinquishing his throne. ``It's not a good thing,'' Greene said.
``He's doing what makes him feel good. The sport was on his
shoulders for so long, I really believe he didn't think it could go
on without him. Now he's seeing it going on, and I think he's
bitter. I hope he gets over it.''
</P>
<P>
   As tickets continue to sell at a fast clip, scalpers say those
for finals should command up to 30 percent over face value if
Australians are involved in the competition. For a non-Aussie
final, expect to pay a 20 percent premium. However, Closing
Ceremonies tickets aren't as much in demand. They can be found for
up to 30 percent less than face.
</P>
<P>
   While the ``wave'' is long gone as a crowd favorite at sporting
events in the U.S., it remains popular in other countries. At the
Olympic Stadium Tuesday morning, spectators kept a wave going for
several minutes. When it reached the media section and slowed down,
the crowd booed, but fans in the upper deck kept it alive.
</P>
<P>
   So, what does ``oi, oi, oi,'' really mean? ``Annoying, annoying,
annoying,'' said one Australian.
</P>
<P>
   The places journalist will go to get a story! As a ferry slowly
made its way to Manly, a North Sydney suburb, passengers noticed a
lone boat floating off to one side of the Olympic regatta. The tiny
motorboat was flying a flag that said ``Media.'' There were one
reporter and one photographer aboard, and they looked like they
were enjoying lunch.

 &HT;    Devers starts her quest for Olympic medal
 &HT;    By Mike Fish
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   SYDNEY - Gail Devers would show up at the start line in full
body cast, if need be. Adversity and injury seem to track Devers
like a puppy _ from a bout with Graves' disease, to never-ending
muscular aches and pains, to stumbling over the final hurdle at the
1992 Olympics.
</P>
<P>
   The injury du jour? A troublesome sciatic nerve, shooting jolts
of pain up her left leg and lower back.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everybody always kids me, `You go to the track or for
treatment. Those are the only two places you go,''' Devers said.
</P>
<P>
   With the semifinal and final today in the 100-meter hurdles,
Devers ranks the favorite for gold after the best season of her
career. Sharon Couch has also advanced to the semis.
</P>
<P>
   The issue for both is whether they can hold up to the rigors of
two races in a day. Devers injured herself Aug. 25 at a meet in
Brussels, while Couch has labored all season with a strained
abdominal muscle.
</P>
<P>
   ``I won't let myself feel the pain,'' Devers said. ``This is
what I work for. I can't let the medal that keeps eluding me be
lost because of pain.''
</P>
<P>
   With Atlanta gold medalist Ludmila Engquist in retirement and no
other finalist from four years ago still in the field, the elusive
gold medal appears Devers' to lose.
</P>
<P>
   If the script had gone as planned, Devers might be lugging
around two Olympic medals from the 100 hurdles by now. She had the
race won in Barcelona and fell coming off the last hurdle. Then in
Atlanta, after the worst start of her life, she rallied only to be
nosed out for the bronze.

 By JANE FRITSCH  
 c.2000 The New York Times  
<TEXT>
 &UR; (Distributed by New York Times Special Features) &LR;  &QC;
<P>
   In Seattle, an e-commerce start-up is looking for an Internet
Code Warrior. In San Francisco, a high-technology company needs an
XML Guru. In Albany, a computer maker has an opening for an
E-Commerce Solution Architect.
</P>
<P>
   Those job titles, from a recent batch of electronic help-wanted
ads, are at once grandiose and vague, designed to suggest the
limitless possibilities of careers in cyberspace. In a labor market
so tight that stock options and BMWs elicit a yawn, some personnel
managers hope that titles with a little panache will give them an
edge.
</P>
<P>
   Exotic job titles have been part of cyberspace culture since the
beginning, before computer geeks were masters of the universe and
were simply looking for respect.
</P>
<P>
   ``Weird titles are so much the norm in Silicon Valley that after
you've been here for any time at all, you stop noticing it,'' said
Paul Saffo, director of the Institute for the Future in Menlo Park,
Calif.
</P>
<P>
   The practice began at Apple Computer in the mid-1980s, he said.
Everyone was allowed to have two business cards, one with a formal
title and the other with any title they wanted.
</P>
<P>
   Titles were more entertaining then, Saffo said. One Apple
employee called himself Director/Off-Planet Operations. But after a
junior employee put ``chairman'' on his second card, Apple put
limits on the practice, he added.
</P>
<P>
   One of the earliest and most creative titles belonged to Guy
Kawasaki, who was known as Apple's ``Software Evangelist,'' when
the company was struggling for a share of the evolving personal
computer marketplace. Kawasaki joined Apple in 1983, when the
Macintosh PC was viewed as innovative but too slow for business
users.
</P>
<P>
   His job was to use the fervor of a missionary to persuade
software developers to write programs for the machines. Since then,
others have used the term, and others like it, but they have become
so commonplace that they now have little meaning, Saffo said.
</P>
<P>
   ``The first man to compare his lover's lips to a rose was quite
possibly a genius, but the second one and everyone after that were
quite certainly not.''
</P>
<P>
   Titles like ``visionary'' came into being because in
cyberspace's early days, people saw themselves as having a broader
mission than the ordinary worker, said Jan English Lueck, the
chairwoman of the anthropology department at San Jose State
University in California. ``It's very closely linked to a world
view that they're doing higher work,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, many in the computer industry do not take themselves
quite so seriously.
</P>
<P>
   At America Online, David Baker, a graphic designer, was known as
the Vice President of Cool in the mid-1990s. His job was to think
of ``cool and interesting ways'' to present the company's site to
users, said Tricia Primrose, a spokeswoman for America Online. And
Russ Leatherman, the voice and president of AOL Moviefone, is
commonly known as Moviefone.
</P>
<P>
   Sometimes the English language just does not contain words
adequate to describe what's happening in cyberspace, and so, it
would seem, new words must be invented. One is ``cybrarian,'' which
has forced its way into some acceptance. No less staid a body than
the American Library Association has begun publishing a
``Cybrarian's Manual,'' with sections on ``cyberciting'' and
``civic cybrarianship.''
</P>
<P>
   Susan Geller Ettenheim, who holds the title of cybrarian at
Cybergrrl Inc., said she was a combination of librarian and
Internet specialist. Her services are available through
www.femina.com, a directory of international links to Web sites for
women.
</P>
<P>
   But some job recruiters offer a warning to companies tempted to
get too creative with job titles: potential employees may not know
what you're talking about.
</P>
<P>
   ``The simpler you make the title, the more likely you are to
attract a candidate,'' said David Garcia, a recruiter for Hall
Kinion, an information technology employment firm in Cupertino,
Calif. Someone searching for a job as a senior software engineer is
likely to search using those key words, he said. If the position is
advertised as a ``guru,'' the applicant may never see it.
</P>
<P>
   At the very least, Garcia said, the title should be
comprehensible. He said he once tried to fill a company's request
for a ``product manager for syndicated services,'' but no one was
able to explain what that was. ``I have no idea. I never did know.
And they wanted someone with two to three years' experience.''
</P>
<P>
   As far as he knows, Garcia said, the company is still looking.

 c.2000 The New York Times

<P>
   When Mallinckrodt Inc., a St. Louis-based health-care company,
sought Food and Drug Administration approval for a diagnostic
medical dye in 1998, it had to submit 198 volumes documenting its
clinical tests _ in duplicate. Each book was 2 inches to 3 inches
thick, and the company needed a truck to haul them to Washington.
</P>
<P>
   The FDA wants to dispense with all that paper by 2002, by
accepting applications for new drug approvals online. Because the
clinical-testing phase of new treatments can last for years,
companies such as Mallinckrodt are eager to convert paper
documentation trails into electronic archives.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm really enthusiastic about this,'' says Dr. Ray Schmelter,
the company's senior director of medical affairs. ``As we do more
and more tests on more and more patients, we can get buried in our
own paper.''
</P>
<P>
   But digging out involves some hard decisions. Mallinckrodt can
buy software and ask consultants to help customize it to handle a
particular set of drug trials, or the company can rent a Web-based
software solution such as those offered by EnMed Inc., a
Burlington, Mass.-based company that manages the flow of
information and documents from data entry by medical technicians to
the transmission of a finished report to the FDA
</P>
<P>
   EnMed did not create its software from scratch. It customized
the document-management programs of Documentum, a company in
Pleasanton, Calif., that also sells software directly to end users.
</P>
<P>
   FDA regulations require that every entry in a patient's file,
even the correction of a typographical error, be dated, and that
the person who changed the entry be identified in the file. EnMed
assigns each user a password and keeps track of such changes. When
the reporting phase begins, it creates links to databases and
raw-data entries to help FDA readers move more quickly through the
document.
</P>
<P>
   ``That information is there on paper,'' Schmelter says. ``But
you might have to go from volume to volume to track it.''
</P>
<P>
   If Mallinckrodt does enlist EnMed's services, the manufacturer
will pay a monthly fee for each individual user. EnMed, whose
business model is sometimes referred to as an application service
provider, or A.S.P., varies its fees based on user access.
</P>
<P>
   ``In addition to cutting costs,'' Schmelter says, ``we want to
reduce the clinical-cycle time as much as possible.''
</P>
<P>
   He sees a future in which clinical-report forms will be replaced
by online entries, a great advantage when patients are scattered
across a large geographical area.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Net data can be retrieved in real time, instead of sending
people to audit the results,'' he says. ``We can clean data as we
go.''
</P>
<P>
   Financial industries from Wall Street to Main Street face
similar issues, particularly as state and federal regulations
increase the pressures to keep track of e-mail messages and
electronic documents.
</P>
<P>
   SEC Regulation 17a-4, for example, requires that brokerage firms
keep every communication with each client in an easily accessible,
tamperproof archive for at least three years _ much longer, if a
broker leaves the firm. Such communications, which must also be
filed with a third party, are increasingly likely to be in the form
of e-mail messages.
</P>
<P>
   Zantaz.com, of Pleasanton, Calif., has become a third-party
archiver for the online-trading industry. Capturing, archiving and
retrieving the data, however, are only parts of the service.
</P>
<P>
   ``Zantaz helps us satisfy our compliance requirements,'' says
Tom Bevilacqua, a spokesman for ETrade. ``But, maybe as important
from a customer-service requirement, being able to quickly recall
customer e-mails is a huge value-added feature that we rely upon.''
</P>
<P>
   Steve Schank, a Zantaz spokesman, added: ``Some of the
cyber-documents never really exist. It's just data sent through an
HTML page. So we not only archive things you think of as documents
_ e-mail, attachments and so on _ but also transactions.''
</P>
<P>
   Zantaz uses optical-storage media known as WORM disks _ it
stands for ``Write Once Read Many'' _ which are mentioned in the
SEC rules. The company says it ``e-staples'' related documents
together and stores everything in a ``digital safe.'' In the near
future, Schank says, individual consumers might rent space in a
digital safe in addition to keeping a safe-deposit box.
</P>
<P>
   Banks and credit unions have been scanning and digitizing
documents for years to reduce their paper archives. Unlike the
securities and pharmaceutical industries, however, they can't quite
do without paper yet.
</P>
<P>
   ``For binding legal documents, signatures still need to be made
on paper,'' says Diane Latine, director of optical services at
United Datatronics Inc., based in Tallahassee, Fla. United
Datatronics uses software by OTG, of Bethesda, Md., to provide
records-management services to five local credit unions.
</P>
<P>
   But when the binding digital signature arrives, Latine says,
paper may be history. Once a loan document has been created, it is
digitized and stored in a ``jukebox'' of CDs. The loan officers who
deal with customers after the initial paperwork is completed can
call up the digital copy without leaving their desks.
</P>
<P>
   Regulations allow records of paid-off loans to be destroyed
after five or six years. The real backlog of paper is in mortgages,
which stay active for 30 years or more.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've scanned 1 million documents for our clients since
1996,'' Latine says. ``And one of our credit unions has barely
touched its loan portfolio.''

 By JANE FRITSCH  
 c.2000 The New York Times  
<TEXT>
 &UR; (Distributed by New York Times Special Features) &LR;  &QC;
<P>
   In Seattle, an e-commerce start-up is looking for an Internet
Code Warrior. In San Francisco, a high-technology company needs an
XML Guru. In Albany, a computer maker has an opening for an
E-Commerce Solution Architect.
</P>
<P>
   Those job titles, from a recent batch of electronic help-wanted
ads, are at once grandiose and vague, designed to suggest the
limitless possibilities of careers in cyberspace. In a labor market
so tight that stock options and BMWs elicit a yawn, some personnel
managers hope that titles with a little panache will give them an
edge.
</P>
<P>
   Exotic job titles have been part of cyberspace culture since the
beginning, before computer geeks were masters of the universe and
were simply looking for respect.
</P>
<P>
   ``Weird titles are so much the norm in Silicon Valley that after
you've been here for any time at all, you stop noticing it,'' said
Paul Saffo, director of the Institute for the Future in Menlo Park,
Calif.
</P>
<P>
   The practice began at Apple Computer in the mid-1980s, he said.
Everyone was allowed to have two business cards, one with a formal
title and the other with any title they wanted.
</P>
<P>
   Titles were more entertaining then, Saffo said. One Apple
employee called himself Director/Off-Planet Operations. But after a
junior employee put ``chairman'' on his second card, Apple put
limits on the practice, he added.
</P>
<P>
   One of the earliest and most creative titles belonged to Guy
Kawasaki, who was known as Apple's ``Software Evangelist,'' when
the company was struggling for a share of the evolving personal
computer marketplace. Kawasaki joined Apple in 1983, when the
Macintosh PC was viewed as innovative but too slow for business
users.
</P>
<P>
   His job was to use the fervor of a missionary to persuade
software developers to write programs for the machines. Since then,
others have used the term, and others like it, but they have become
so commonplace that they now have little meaning, Saffo said.
</P>
<P>
   ``The first man to compare his lover's lips to a rose was quite
possibly a genius, but the second one and everyone after that were
quite certainly not.''
</P>
<P>
   Titles like ``visionary'' came into being because in
cyberspace's early days, people saw themselves as having a broader
mission than the ordinary worker, said Jan English Lueck, the
chairwoman of the anthropology department at San Jose State
University in California. ``It's very closely linked to a world
view that they're doing higher work,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, many in the computer industry do not take themselves
quite so seriously.
</P>
<P>
   At America Online, David Baker, a graphic designer, was known as
the Vice President of Cool in the mid-1990s. His job was to think
of ``cool and interesting ways'' to present the company's site to
users, said Tricia Primrose, a spokeswoman for America Online. And
Russ Leatherman, the voice and president of AOL Moviefone, is
commonly known as Moviefone.
</P>
<P>
   Sometimes the English language just does not contain words
adequate to describe what's happening in cyberspace, and so, it
would seem, new words must be invented. One is ``cybrarian,'' which
has forced its way into some acceptance. No less staid a body than
the American Library Association has begun publishing a
``Cybrarian's Manual,'' with sections on ``cyberciting'' and
``civic cybrarianship.''
</P>
<P>
   Susan Geller Ettenheim, who holds the title of cybrarian at
Cybergrrl Inc., said she was a combination of librarian and
Internet specialist. Her services are available through
www.femina.com, a directory of international links to Web sites for
women.
</P>
<P>
   But some job recruiters offer a warning to companies tempted to
get too creative with job titles: potential employees may not know
what you're talking about.
</P>
<P>
   ``The simpler you make the title, the more likely you are to
attract a candidate,'' said David Garcia, a recruiter for Hall
Kinion, an information technology employment firm in Cupertino,
Calif. Someone searching for a job as a senior software engineer is
likely to search using those key words, he said. If the position is
advertised as a ``guru,'' the applicant may never see it.
</P>
<P>
   At the very least, Garcia said, the title should be
comprehensible. He said he once tried to fill a company's request
for a ``product manager for syndicated services,'' but no one was
able to explain what that was. ``I have no idea. I never did know.
And they wanted someone with two to three years' experience.''
</P>
<P>
   As far as he knows, Garcia said, the company is still looking.

 &HT;    U.S. loses, but will play for soccer bronze
 &HT;    By Wendy Parker
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   SYDNEY - Just when it looked like Spain would embarrass the
United States in one of the biggest men's games ever for the young
Americans, they showed some of the pluck that has made them one of
the biggest soccer surprises of the Olympics.
</P>
<P>
   After giving up a 2-0 lead in the first 25 minutes of their
semifinal match at the Sydney Football Stadium today, the U.S. got
back one of the goals before halftime and made a brief game of it
against a squad that features promising talent for some of the top
clubs in Spain and Italy.
</P>
<P>
   But their ``pretty wild'' ride, as Josh Wolff referred to their
unexpected run though the tournament, ended three minutes before
the end of regulation.
</P>
<P>
   A tap-in goal by AC Milan striker Jose Mari in the 87th minute
provided the crushing blow by Spain in a 3-1 victory. The United
States can still win a medal on Friday when it meets Chile for the
bronze. In Saturday's gold medal match, Spain will meet Cameroon,
which shocked the heavily favored Chileans 2-1 in Melbourne today.
</P>
<P>
   Easy goals by Tamudo and Angulo threatened to inflict the kind
of searing wound the U.S. has suffered all too often against
top-flight international opposition. The swift, elegant Spaniards,
many of whom were part of last year's under-20 world championship
team, dominated possession and showed dangerous skills that the
Americans were slow to counter.
</P>
<P>
   And the Americans, who got away with numerous defensive mistakes
in outlasting Japan Saturday on corner kicks, paid for their errors
dearly in the early going. They also had enormous trouble keeping
up with Xavi, Barcelona's emerging playmaker.

 &HT;    The U.S. kids have grown up
 &HT;    By Wendy Parker
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   SYDNEY - When Mia Hamm, Kristine Lilly and Julie Foudy were the
``kids'' of the U.S. women's soccer team in the late 1980s, they
really were kids. High school kids.
</P>
<P>
   None of them have turned 30 yet, but they're among the
undeniable veterans of the team. Earlier this year, Hamm and Lilly
became the first soccer players ever to make more than 200
international appearances. Foudy recently was tossed the captain's
armband and has always been the vocal leader of the clubhouse.
</P>
<P>
   The kids on the 2000 Olympic team are grown women. The youngest,
Michelle French and Danielle Slaton, are missing the first part of
their sophomore seasons in college and are here mainly to soak up
the atmosphere.
</P>
<P>
   Still others, like midfielder Nikki Serlenga, bound for Atlanta
in the Women's United Soccer Association, recently finished their
college eligibility and are awaiting their turn to play.
</P>
<P>
   But the retirement last month of icon Michelle Akers after 15
brave, but injury-riddled years, may have signalled that a gradual
transition already is underway.
</P>
<P>
   Three key performers during the stretch run of last year's
Women's World Cup do not have active playing roles with the team in
the Olympics. Akers, indispensable in the final two games of that
tournament, couldn't overcome shoulder surgery over the summer.
Former captain Carla Overbeck, so instrumental in the World Cup
final, and goalkeeper Briana Scurry, who made the memorable save
during penalty kicks, also have been injured all year.
</P>
<P>
   In their places are three faces who represent a gradual changing
of the guard on a team that has become the best in the world
because of its familiarity and camaraderie.
</P>
<P>
   ``You won't see that many more people with 13 to 15 year careers
again,'' U.S. coach April Heinrichs said. ``You just won't see that
again.''
</P>
<P>
   The Americans will play in Thursday's final against Norway, the
closest thing they have to a nemesis.

 &HT;    After three losses, U.S. rallies to claim gold medal
 &HT;    By Henry Unger
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   SYDNEY - The scrappy U.S. women's softball team arrived here as
favorites only to see its prospects fade quickly with an
unprecedented three-game losing streak.
</P>
<P>
   Backs to the wall, the United States had to win five games in a
row to repeat as gold medalists.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a very emotional tournament for this team,'' said ace
pitcher Lisa Fernandez. ``We had to fight for everything.''
</P>
<P>
   On Tuesday, with Fernandez on the mound, the team clawed its way
back to gold by defeating Japan 2-1 in an extra inning game that
saw the U.S. muster only one hit.
</P>
<P>
   But in the bottom of the eighth inning, with rain falling and
the score tied 1-1, pinch runner Jennifer McFalls came home from
second with the winning run when Japanese left fielder Shiori
Koseki misjudged and then dropped a fly ball hit by Laura Berg.
</P>
<P>
   ``It felt great coming off the bat and when the ball came out of
her glove, I knew it was ours,'' Berg said. ``We have been very
unlucky this whole tournament and, finally, luck went our way.''
</P>
<P>
   Koseki waited too long to go back on the ball. She managed to
catch it, but the ball popped out as she fell backward on the
grass.
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. team then stormed the field in jubilation.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's the most amazing feeling to win this,'' Berg said.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's always sweeter the second time around,'' added head coach
Ralph Raymond.
</P>
<P>
   For much of the game, however, it looked like Japan, which had
gone undefeated, might dethrone the Americans.
</P>
<P>
   In the fourth inning, the Japanese scored first when third
baseman Reika Utsugi ripped a home run to straight away center
field over Berg's outstretched arm.
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. managed to tie the game in the fifth inning after
Japan's starting pitcher Mariko Masubuchi hit designated hitter
Michele Smith with a pitch. Smith advanced to second on a ground
ball and then scored on a single to right center by catcher Stacey
Nuveman.
</P>
<P>
   Nuveman accounted for the team's only hit and started the eighth
inning magic with a walk from reliever Juri Takayama. McFalls then
replaced her on first as a pinch-runner.
</P>
<P>
   Dot Richardson, who blasted a home run to win the 1996 Games,
also walked. That brought Berg to the plate to hit the game-winning
fly ball to left.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I hit it and started to run, I was watching her (Koseki)
all the way,'' Berg said. ``I saw her going back on it. Then she
just went down and the ball came right out of her glove.''
</P>
<P>
   Fernandez got the win. She was able to fan eight and give up
only three hits, while the Japanese left four on base.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was going to fight until we came out on top,'' Fernandez
said, adding that she was successful in ``nit-picking at the
corners.''
</P>
<P>
   She was aided by some good defensive play at shortstop by Crystl
Bustos.
</P>
<P>
   Several of the U.S. players talked about the emotional
roller-coaster ride they've been on during the Games.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's been full circle, emotionally and physically,'' Nuveman
said. ``Winning tonight shows so much about the athletes that we
have, that we can win against those that have beaten us.''
</P>
<P>
   Earlier in the tournament, Japan defeated the U.S. 2-1 in 11
innings.
</P>
<P>
   But this time the breaks went the other way.
</P>
<P>
   ``We played our hearts out,'' said Smith, a member of the gold
medal team at the Atlanta Games. ``We have a lot of character.''

 &HT;    Lindland runs out of appeals
 &HT;    By Mike Tierney
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   SYDNEY - There was no arbitrator to save him. No appeals court
to overturn the decision.
</P>
<P>
   Matt Lindland, who took Olympic litigation to new heights _ or
depths, depending on one's point of view _ ran out of adjudicating
luck Tuesday in the gold-medal match of 76 kg Greco-Roman
wrestling.
</P>
<P>
   The referee awarded Russian Mourat Kardanov three points on a
pair of early maneuvers. Kardanov made no attempt to pad his lead,
instead assuming a defensive posture that foiled Lindland to the
end. He never scored.
</P>
<P>
   Lindland became an Olympian after negotiating through enough
legal twists and turns to take up a week of ``People's Court''
episodes.
</P>
<P>
   He lost at the U.S. Trials to Keith Sieracki. Lost an appeal to
USA Wrestling. Won an arbitrator's decision that dictated a
rematch. Won the match. Lost when Sieracki found another arbitrator
to rule in his favor. Won when a U.S. District Court judge ruled
against the USOC, which had placed Sieracki on its roster. Won when
a U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals backed the judge. Won, finally,
when a U.S. Supreme Court justice declined the USOC's emergency
request on Sieracki's behalf.
</P>
<P>
   The case was enlivened by Sieracki's accusations that Lindland
bit his ear in the Trials.
</P>
<P>
   Lindland's success streak extended to Sydney. He won three
matches to reach the finals of a weak weight class. After the
semis, his opponent lost an appeal on a scoring decision.
</P>
<P>
   Dan Chandler, the U.S. Greco-Roman coach, acknowledged that the
ordeal disrupted Lindland's training and the team's psyche. Two
team photos were taken, one with each 76-kg'er.
</P>
<P>
   One of his obscure teammates, Garrett Lowney, secured a
surprising bronze in 97 kg. He outpointed Konstantinos Thanos of
Greece 3-1. Lowney is only 20 and a temporary convert from
freestyle wrestling. He whipped a five-time world champion in the
quarterfinals.

 &HT;    Texas wrestler goes from Amarillo to Australia, via Pennsylvania
 &HT;    By John Maher
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   SYDNEY _ From Amarillo to Australia is not a common journey, and
for
</P>
<P>
   a wrestler it's almost an impossible one.
</P>
<P>
   But Brandon Slay is here at the Olympics. Born and bred in a
state
</P>
<P>
   where wrestling meant rasslin' and the Von Erichs, he's the only
native
</P>
<P>
   Texan on the United States wrestling team. He may well be the
only U.S.
</P>
<P>
   Olympic wrestler ever brought up in the Lone Star state, where
until
</P>
<P>
   recently real wrestling was a pariah.
</P>
<P>
   Slay was a three-time state champion at Amarillo Tascosa High
School
</P>
<P>
   from 1991-93 and was a runner-up in 1990. But that was back in
the days
</P>
<P>
   when the University Interscholastic League, the main governing
body of
</P>
<P>
   Texas high school athletics, didn't sanction the sport. Only in
the past
</P>
<P>
   few years has the UIL become involved with wrestling, and Slay
is very
</P>
<P>
   conscious about what a boost he could give his sport in his home
state
</P>
<P>
   with an inspiring performance here.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's extremely special. It means so much to me. I'll do
whatever it
</P>
<P>
   takes to promote wrestling in Texas,'' said Slay. He'll be
competing in
</P>
<P>
   freestyle wrestling here at 76 kilograms, 167.5 pounds.
Competition
</P>
<P>
   there runs from Thursday through Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   To learn his craft Slay turned his back on football, where he'd
been
</P>
<P>
   likened to Zach Thomas. He had to head east to college, to the
</P>
<P>
   University of Pennsylvania, to wrestle and study business. He
never won
</P>
<P>
   an NCAA championship there, but he did finish second in 1997 and
1998.
</P>
<P>
   He steadily improved and developed a reputation for learning how
to beat
</P>
<P>
   wrestlers who'd beaten him earlier in his career.
</P>
<P>
   He finally got a win against Joe Williams, but it was Williams
who was
</P>
<P>
   favored at the U.S. Olympic trials in Dallas. It seemed Slay was
</P>
<P>
   destined to meet him in the final when Williams was upset by
Brian
</P>
<P>
   Dolph, an assistant coach at Penn, who was Slay's wrestling
partner and
</P>
<P>
   friend.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of anxiety came over me. I spent 80 percent of my time
</P>
<P>
   preparing for Joe. There was a lot of negative things going
through my
</P>
<P>
   mind for awhile,'' Slay admitted. ``I had to approach it that
Brian was a
</P>
<P>
   mound of flesh in my way. Once it was over I could re-connect.''
</P>
<P>
   After a rather rough match, Dolph congratulated his pupil. He
also
</P>
<P>
   later worked with him at Colorado Springs, where Slay trained
after the
</P>
<P>
   trials.
</P>
<P>
   ``After the trials I was on Cloud Nine. I had to refocus,'' Slay
said
</P>
<P>
   He spent his time there doing two-hour session, twice a day,
getting
</P>
<P>
   ready for the trip. Dolph ended up getting a ride here, too.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm allowed to bring a training partner to Sydney, so I picked
Brian,''
</P>
<P>
   Slay said.
</P>
<P>
   While training, Slay developed a persistent infection in his
arm. With
</P>
<P>
   the Olympics approaching he and the wrestling staff took no
chances. He
</P>
<P>
   was hospitalized and given strong antibiotics. He found a bright
side to
</P>
<P>
   that, however.
</P>
<P>
   ``The way I was training, my body needed some time off,'' Slay
said. ``In
</P>
<P>
   the hospital I was on the seventh floor looking out at Pike's
Peak or
</P>
<P>
   watching college football. I had nurses coming into my room; it
was like
</P>
<P>
   room service.''
</P>
<P>
   Slay isn't favored to win a medal here.
</P>
<P>
   The gold medal favorite is probably Bouvaisa Saitiev of Russia,
</P>
<P>
   considered by many to be the best freestyle wrestler in the
world. He
</P>
<P>
   won the gold medal in Atlanta and also captured three world
</P>
<P>
   championships in non-Olympic years. Alexander Leipold of Germany
was the silver medalist in the world championships last year. Moon
Eui-jae of
</P>
<P>
   Korea is also a strong medal threat.
</P>
<P>
   Slay, however, is hoping the big names, and some of the smaller
ones,
</P>
<P>
   will overlook him. He's not looking past any wrestler.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've got tapes of everybody,'' said Slay, who thinks going to
the tape
</P>
<P>
   is an invaluable tool. ``Wrestlers don't change. You can pick up
their
</P>
<P>
   tendencies, their favorite move and when they like to try it.
You can
</P>
<P>
   even see speed and strength. If someone's snapping a guy all
over the
</P>
<P>
   place, you can tell he's strong. If he's hitting a double leg
through a
</P>
<P>
   guy before he reacts, you know he's really fast.''
</P>
<P>
   He added, ``A lot of guys watch tape, but they don't do it to
the extent
</P>
<P>
   I do it. A lot of guys will start jumping around twitching when
they're
</P>
<P>
   watching. They'll be wrestling the guy instead of watching.''
</P>
<P>
   Slay will fly under the radar of most of the national media
here, which
</P>
<P>
   often only cares about gold. But a medal, any medal, would be a
first
</P>
<P>
   for Texas and a huge boost for the sport in the state. Slay
knows it and
</P>
<P>
   wants to be Texas' Lone Star in Olympic wrestling.

VICE ADMIRAL TAKING COMMAND OF MEDITERRANEAN FLEET 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (a and i coding)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JOHN DONNELLY  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ He grew up on a farm of potato fields and henhouses
in the northern tip of Maine, walking a mile to and from a one-room
schoolhouse, which had seven students in grades one through six.
Three were members of his family.
</P>
<P>
   From those beginnings, Gregory G. Johnson rose through the ranks
of the Navy, to the highest levels of the Pentagon, to his new job
this week in which he will be eyeballing President Slobodan
Milosevic of Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
   Johnson, a three-star vice admiral, left his position this week
as senior military assistant to Defense Secretary William S. Cohen
to take command of the Sixth Fleet, where he will oversee 15,000
sailors and Marines and 30 warships.
</P>
<P>
   Instead of assuming formal command on Friday at the home port of
Gaeta, Italy, as planned, Johnson will immediately face a test. He
is to fly to his command ship, the USS LaSalle, which has been put
on alert in the Mediterranean to monitor the aftermath of Sunday's
chaotic voting in Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
   In case something goes very wrong following the elections, the
fleet _ soon to be Johnson's fleet _ will be poised to take a
variety of possible actions.
</P>
<P>
   He welcomes the challenge. He's happy just to be back at sea.
</P>
<P>
   Johnson, 54, has spent 16 years at sea, about half the duration
of his marriage. His naval background is as an aviator, part of a
community known for its swagger, but that is not Johnson. His
aviator-given nickname is Grog, a handle that conjures images of
late-night drinking, but that is not him either.
</P>
<P>
   To understand the new commander of the Sixth Fleet, a man of
moderation, is to throw out the stereotypes of military officers
and see him through the lens of growing up in Maine, specifically
Westmanland, Maine, population 40, of having roots in land
purchased by his Swedish great-grandfather in the late 19th
century.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am a fanatic. I'm a zealot when it comes to Maine,'' he said
one night recently in Washington after returning from his 50-acre
salt farm in Harpswell, Maine. ``And beware of zealots.''
</P>
<P>
   In his one-room schoolhouse, Johnson and his late brother,
Warren, only 10 1/2 months younger, were the janitors, each earning
30 cents a day to bring in a bucket of water for drinking and
``washing the chalkboard, putting a scoop of lime in the latrines,
carrying in the wood, and getting the fire going,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Such chores, he said, helped prepare him for the military.
</P>
<P>
   ``The wonderful thing about that community in Maine is several
circles of families embraced you, cared about you,'' he said. ``If
you did something that wasn't right, you not only let down your
immediate family, you let down your community family, let down your
church family, let down your 4-H family.''
</P>
<P>
   ``You had all these different communities _ just like the
military is an ever-increasing circle of families.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Maine shaped who he is,'' said his daughter Ashley, 24, who
lives in Boston's North End. ``It made up his character. The same
hard work that allowed his parents to persevere up there is the
same work ethic that allowed him to climb the ladder.''
</P>
<P>
   ``You get a sense,'' said his other daughter, Sydney, 28, who
lives in Washington, ``he knows what his place is. A lot of people
out there _ and he loves to say this _ are a lot smarter than he
is. He is humbled by his past, and he lives that way. I don't think
he ever dreamed he would be where he is today.''
</P>
<P>
   Johnson, slightly taller than 6 feet, his posture erect, his
stride that of a long-legged distance runner that he is, now faces
a job that calls for substantial military and diplomatic skills.
</P>
<P>
   In recent years, he has served as military assistant to the
former Joint Chiefs of Staff chairman Colin Powell, former deputy
defense secretary John Hamre, and, for the past 16 months, Cohen.
It has been a highly unusual career path, one viewed by outsiders
as being one plum job after the other but seen by some inside the
Navy as being away too long from operational command.
</P>
<P>
   Working for Cohen _ a Bangor native, although the two met in the
Pentagon _ has been a selfless job, reviewing every classified
document for him, acting as liaison between Cohen and the armed
services, and briefing him on matters ranging from deployment
orders to heated interagency battles.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have to act in a manner that leaves no footprints, no
fingerprints,'' he said. ``I have no agenda. I have the secretary's
agenda.''
</P>
<P>
   Now he must develop his own agenda. He faces multiple issues in
the Mediterranean, including Turkish-Greek relations, the future of
the disputed island of Cyprus, Israel's interaction with its Arab
neighbors, and the unpredictable Balkans _ starting on his first
day on the job.
</P>
<P>
   ``He'll be working 22-hour days and he's going to be on
professional pins and needles,'' said Hamre, now head of the Center
for Strategic and International Studies, a Washington think tank
that has long studied defense issues.
</P>
<P>
   First, though, when he lands on the USS LaSalle, carrying his
two nearly worn-out L.L. Bean tote bags, he must address those
under his command.
</P>
<P>
   Said Hamre: ``His big challenge is to convince people who don't
know him that he was the best commanding officer for the Sixth
Fleet, not that he was a political appointment. I think he'll take
care of that right away. If I could pick the perfect embodiment of
a military officer, I think it would be him.''
</P>
<P>
   But for the last year or so, even as he traveled around the
world with Cohen and worked long hours in the Pentagon, his life
wasn't all centered on military.
</P>
<P>
   For the first time in a decade, he and his wife, Joy, and their
two daughters lived in the same city.
</P>
<P>
   ``What's been great is the small things; it's Greg coming home
from work, the kids being here for dinner,'' said Joy Johnson.
</P>
<P>
   That time is over. The vice admiral and his wife leave Monday
for Italy.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's sadness, but we are ready to roll,'' said Joy Johnson.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had a wonderful year,'' said the vice admiral. ``But when
you grow up in a fairly cloistered corner of the world, you develop
a sense of adventure. It's something we didn't have. The Navy sort
of fills that itch. In Washington, you mature, you gather wisdom,
you learn diplomatic skills, but it's not like being out there.
That's where I want to be.''

 &HT;    MEXICAN PRESIDENT-ELECT WANTS TO EASE MIGRANT MONEY TRANSFERS
 &HT;    By SUSAN FERRISS 
 &HT;    c.2000 Cox News Service 
<TEXT>
<P>
   MEXICO CITY _ Mexican president-elect Vicente Fox will try to
make it easier and cheaper for Mexican migrants in the United
States to send more than $7 billion in annual earnings home to
sustain families, a top Fox aide said here Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Fox migration advisor Juan Hernandez _ a professor at the
University of Texas at Dallas _ said one of Fox's priorities is to
help migrants avoid exorbitant money-wiring fees and low exchange
rates that cut these vital earnings by up to 30 percent by the time
they reach families in Mexico.
</P>
<P>
   The money Mexican migrants send home is one of Mexico's greatest
sources of revenue generated from abroad _ after manufacturing, oil
and tourism. The migrants' earnings helps pay for food, housing
construction, public works and the establishment of small
businesses.
</P>
<P>
   An alternative to sending money through wiring services might be
via U.S. credit unions that migrants' families can access in Mexico
using ATM cards, Hernandez told reporters.
</P>
<P>
   ``Let's dream big, as Vicente would say,'' Hernandez said,
outlining a number of ambitious ideas on migration that, in part,
would require U.S. cooperation.
</P>
<P>
   Hernandez, of UT-Dallas' Center for U.S.-Mexico Studies, worked
on Fox's campaign, which made history by toppling the 71-year-old
reign of the Revolutionary Institutional Party, called the PRI.
Fox, who belongs to the National Action Party, takes office on Dec.
1 for a six-year term.
</P>
<P>
   ``I actually haven't gotten over that we won,'' Hernandez said.
``It gives me incredible faith that we can do incredible things in
the next six years.''
</P>
<P>
   On Thursday and Friday Hernandez travels to Dallas and Austin,
the Texas capital, for meetings with Mexican and Mexican-American
businesses and UT representatives. Accompanying him will be Pablo
Salazar, a Fox ally who was recently elected the first opposition
governor of Mexico's strife-torn Chiapas state.
</P>
<P>
   Salazar will visit official trade offices and private businesses
that opened in the Dallas area from Fox's home state of Guanajuato
while he was governor. Fox wants to replicate the idea on a bigger
scale, with all Mexican states participating.
</P>
<P>
   Hernandez said Fox aims to improve a range of existing Mexican
federal programs designed to help migrants. He wants to expand a
pilot program that allows migrants to pay US$350 to enroll their
relatives in Mexico's national health insurance program. Migrants
often send money back home to pay for medical needs of elderly
parents or other family members.
</P>
<P>
   Fox also wants to review the controversial policy of charging
tariffs on goods brought back by migrants, including televisions
and other appliances.
</P>
<P>
   ``Mexicans in the United States have had to live in the shadows,
and I think it's the fault of both federal governments,'' Hernandez
said.
</P>
<P>
   Mexican migrants help both the U.S. and Mexican economies, but
have to live ``as if they were criminals,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Fox, who once headed Coca-Cola Co.'s Latin America operation,
views migrants in the United States as investors and wants to
channel more of their earnings into job-producing businesses in
their home states, Hernandez added.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is an incredible business opportunity, a way of
bettering the lives of Mexicans by linking them up,'' Hernandez
said.
</P>
<P>
   Hernandez said Fox would like to finance development projects,
too, with an expansion of the San Antonio-based North American
Development Bank, or NADBank. The bank was set up by the 1994 North
American Free Trade Agreement among Mexico, the United States and
Canada and is authorized to loan money only for environmental
clean-up projects now.
</P>
<P>
   With an expanded role, the NADBank could offer educational loans
or offer funds that match business investments by migrants,
Hernandez suggested.
</P>
<P>
   ``Vicente Fox would like it to have a huge fund, billions and
billions, for development in areas that need it,'' Hernandez said.
Mexico would also have to contribute to increasing the bank's
assets, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Fox, Hernandez said, ``is willing to put the money where his
mouth is.''

IT'S NOT JUST THE TIME DIFFERENCE
</HEADLINE>
 By CARYN JAMES    
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   To much of the television audience _ especially the women and
other casual sports followers NBC claims to be eager to court _ the
Olympics is not an athletic event, but rather an entertainment
event that happens to be about sports. You wouldn't want to go to a
cocktail party and not know who Tiger Woods is. In theory, the
Olympics should produce the same need-to-know buzz. You wouldn't
want to go to a party and not know what was going on in Sydney.
</P>
<P>
   But to those of us watching at home, what's going on in Sydney
is an overproduced, misbegotten mess. This marathon of coverage
should have been as huge as ``Survivor,'' but is turning out to
more like ``Big Brother'': People only talk about it to say how
dull it is. The features are more mawkish than ever and the
competition coverage packaged in snippets so busy they make a music
video look leisurely.
</P>
<P>
   In its relentless search for high drama, NBC has stumbled into
high camp. One of its most memorable segments came early and may be
hard to top. ``It has been 6,000 years since man first forged a
relationship with the horse,'' Harry Smith said in a feature about
the equestrian competition, using the grandiose tone that puts the
development of the human-animal bond up there with the first cave
painting. ``The journey has brought us,'' he went on, (``us'' being
people and horses), ``together in a place called trust.''
</P>
<P>
   Some things, like the killer time difference, are beyond the
network's control. Knowing the results is unavoidable, even on NBC.
Typically, on Saturday's ``Today'' show, David Bloom warned viewers
to turn down the volume if they didn't want to know results; then
there was a picture of Marion Jones holding a gold medal. You think
she won?
</P>
<P>
   But NBC could have avoided its lethal mix: Features so
melodramatic they are unintentionally comic, and a style so choppy
it attenuates suspense instead of building it, so slick it is
nearly impossible to tell the commercials from the so-called
reporting.
</P>
<P>
   All the drama, of course, is artificially constructed half a day
after the fact. But it is constructed in a predictable pattern that
is already a parody of itself. Lead in with a 15-second travelogue
about Tasmania (with an Australian-accented narrator), go to Bob
Costas' introduction, a feature about a Chinese gymnast who sees
her parents only twice a year, then a snippet of an actual
competition, followed by a commercial and a medal ceremony for an
event that was covered a half-hour ago. Throw in yet another Marion
Jones profile (now with the endlessly replayed tape of her hulking,
weeping, shot-putter husband, C.J. Hunter, insisting he would never
disgrace his wife and kids by using banned drugs no matter what
those positive test results suggest), and you have a recipe for
disastrous coverage.
</P>
<P>
   After Cathy Freeman's gold-medal winning race on Monday, there
was a commercial, a few minutes of women's pole vaulting, then
Freeman's medal ceremony. But there was a mere glimpse of her
wearing both the Australian and Aboriginal flags on her victory
lap, which should have provided more drama.
</P>
<P>
   Wait long enough and dig hard enough and you'll run across an
athletic feat that is both awe-inspiring and emotional, like Laura
Wilkinson's unexpected gold-medal dive. But watching television
shouldn't be that much work. NBC's producers have made a mistake
any music video director would have been be able to avoid: Being
busier doesn't make a show more interesting, just more cluttered,
and the viewing experience becomes claustrophobic and annoying.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   NBC, of course, has to justify the $705 million it has spent for
these games. It has not only spread each night's coverage over five
grueling hours, it has also held several of the Americans'
gold-medal winning races until after 11 p.m. ET. In track, Marion
Jones and Maurice Greene were seen winning gold medals after 11; in
the men's 50-meter freestyle, in which the swimmers and training
partners Gary Hall Jr. and Anthony Ervin dramatically shared the
gold medal, Costas set up the event, broke for local news, then
returned for the race after 11:30.
</P>
<P>
   This is not some juggling act meant to accommodate East and West
Coast viewers at once. The network sends three feeds to the
different time zones, as with any prime-time presentation. The
strategy, another backfire, is meant to lure viewers into the last
hour, in which there has been a fall-off in the ratings.
</P>
<P>
   Making the Olympics appealing to a broader television audience
is, of course, about constructing celebrities. The commentators are
now dancing around the public relations damage to Jones, their best
hope for stardom, and saying they hope the accusations against her
husband won't be ``a distraction.''
</P>
<P>
   Yet even the star-making machinery is oddly out of touch, with
huge streaks of lingering Cold War mentality and sexism. The
American swimmer Lenny Krayzelburg is one of the most appealing
personalities, low-key, modest and good-looking. One of the many
features about him _ born in Odessa, moved to California _ began,
``He's known life behind the Iron Curtain and in the land of
opportunity.'' When is the last time you heard the term Iron
Curtain used with a straight face?
</P>
<P>
   And after Amy van Dyken spit in Inge de Bruijn's lane, one of
two male swimming commentators noted that ``Inge hissed at her like
a cat.'' The other commentator said, ``I guess this IS going to be
a catfight.'' To the commentators, Gary Hall was cute when he
taunted the Australian swimmers that he would crush them like a
guitar; the women were being catty. That's not the smartest way to
attract female viewers. (And NBC wonders why critics hiss at them.)
</P>
<P>
   Viewers aren't fools. We can tell the difference between Michael
Johnson's race and his commercial for a digital phone service, in
which he runs with a cell phone in his hand and says, ``Hey, coach,
we did it.'' But the Olympics shouldn't be so much like those
familiar commercials that they are just as easy to ignore.
</P>
<P>
   There are alternatives. (Not the CBC's live coverage; all of
Canada is not watching at 5 in the morning.) On MSNBC during the
day, events like men's and women's baseball and rowing have been
unfolding in a leisurely way, with fewer features, like a sports
event instead of a badly packaged show.
</P>
<P>
   But prime time is what matters, and even though those evening
ratings have crept up in the past few days, marginal improvement
doesn't count for much in the midst of so much that has been
botched.
</P>
<P>
   Even a feature about ``The Star-Spangled Banner'' was out of
touch with reality. The song, the report says, ``vaporizes all
cynicism.'' Have they been listening? Instead of a stirring
version, the official Olympic rendition of our national anthem has
a fast-paced ``Play ball!'' style.
</P>
<P>
   Something should be vaporized here, but it's not cynicism; the
cookie cutter for this stale Olympic coverage is the thing that
should vanish. &QL;

<TEXT>
<P>
   SYDNEY, Australia _ Moments after he was cut last spring, a
stunned Doug Mientkiewicz had to make a torturous 500-yard walk
across the parking lot, from the Twins glamorous major league
facility to its minor league outpost.
</P>
<P>
   For months, Mientkiewicz was angry with Minnesota Manager Tom
Kelly for lumping him into a group of young, but petulant talents.
He was bitter toward the Twins management for casting aside their
incumbent first baseman.
</P>
<P>
   Tuesday night, he wanted to thank Kelly. Those 500 yards had
turned into Mientkiewicz's own walk of fame. If he had played in
the major leagues this year, he wouldn't have had a chance to find
glory as pure as this on a world-wide stage. For the second time in
a week, the 23-year-old Mientkiewicz delivered the game-winning
home run against South Korea's unflappable pitching staff.
</P>
<P>
   This time, he gave the United States a 3-2 victory in the ninth,
and pushed this American mix of potential and experience into the
Olympic gold medal game Wednesday night against their geopolitical
rival, the mighty Cubans.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's really amazing,'' Mientkiewicz said. ``I want to shake
Tom Kelly's hand for saying I wasn't ready for the big leagues.''
</P>
<P>
   The roster is full of guys like Mientkiewicz. Some older, some
younger. But all of them have taken the lead of Manager Tommy
Lasorda and found joy in the pressure of representing their
country. Now, faced with Cuba _ the only team that has beaten them
in Sydney, and the only ones that have brought out the Americans'
fighting side _ they want to remember to relax.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have nothing against Cuba, believe me,'' said Lasorda,
whose team was involved in a bench-clearing brawl during their 6-1
loss to Cuba last week. ``We just want to have a good game against
them, and may the best team win.''
</P>
<P>
   Tuesday night, the team with the keenest survival instincts won.
Mientkiewicz's solo home run with one out in the bottom of the
ninth ended a game that crossed the border of the bizarre. There
was nightlong drizzle, plus a lightning storm that scared the first
base umpire off the field before plate umpire Cesar Valdes summoned
him back into position. Finally, after one too many thunder claps,
the game was delayed two hours while a storm passed through.
</P>
<P>
   Just after play resumed at midnight, the odd-ball atmosphere
began again. The United States had the bases loaded with one out
but a controversial double play ended their chance to break a 2-2
tie. After a throw to the plate for a force out, South Korean
catcher Jang Sung Ho turned to fire to first in hopes of turning a
tough double play. But Jang was whacked by a forearm in the back of
the head by the incoming American, Brent Abernathy. Jang dropped
the ball on the play. Much to Lasorda's dismay, Valdes called
interference and the double play was awarded.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've never seen anything like it,'' Lasorda said.
</P>
<P>
   Not even Mientkiewicz's last plate appearance was normal. When
he came up to bat, the plan was for Mientkiewicz to bunt. But
Travis Dawkins, the pinch-runner put into the game for his
base-running savvy, was picked off by reliever Park Seok Jin.
</P>
<P>
   ``My first thought was, `Now I don't have to bunt,''' said
Mientkiewicz.
</P>
<P>
   As he swung through the ball, Mientkiewicz threw his bat in the
air and started to celebrate until he realized the ball was
starting to die in the drizzle.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I hit it, I thought it was going over,'' he said. ``If it
didn't, I would have felt like the biggest idiot. I didn't know
what to do, if I should take my shirt off or what.''
</P>
<P>
   Launching into a pantomime routine, he waved his arms, trying to
coax the ball to go a little farther. And it did, arching just over
the right-field fence. The South Korean team was devastated _
again.
</P>
<P>
   ``In a way, you're heart goes out to them,'' said Mientkiewicz,
whose team was baffled for six innings by the South Korean
submarine pitcher, Chong Tae Hyon. ``They got it ripped out
again.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   He knows how that feels. Last spring, Mientkiewicz's spirits
were crushed when he was sent down to the minor leagues. After
playing first base for the Twins for the entire 1999 season, he was
unceremoniously demoted. At one frustrating point, he reportedly
said he would rather toil in the minors than play under Kelly.
</P>
<P>
   Tuesday night, he didn't want to be anywhere else but here: In
Sydney, playing for a chance at a gold medal. It didn't matter if
most of the fans had gone home during the rain delay. He didn't
care who saw it live _ or tape-delayed.
</P>
<P>
   ``If one person or 100 were left, it didn't put a damper on
anything,'' Mientkiewicz said. ``We get to play for a gold medal.
Tonight, this hit was bigger than the last one against this team.
There was much more at stake.''
</P>
<P>
   Wednesday night the gold medal will be on the line.
Mientkiewicz, who resides in Miami, understands the political
atmosphere that will hang over the game. But after such an
emotional journey here _ a path that included an endless 500-yard
walk last spring _ he wants to put politics aside.
</P>
<P>
   ``Cuba, to me, has no face,'' Mientkiewicz said. ``If Italy was
the best in the world, I'd want to beat Italy.''

FEISTY 19-YEAR-OLD AUSSIE READY TO TAKE ON THE BEST OF THE U.S. 
</HEADLINE>
   By MIKE WISE    
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   SYDNEY, Australia _ Lauren Jackson ran upcourt after a brief
altercation under the basket with the frustrated U.S. player.
</P>
<P>
   This happened two weeks ago in Melbourne when the lithe,
6-foot-5 19-year-old from the Australian national team was bumped
by center Lisa Leslie _ who had come to the aid of her U.S.
teammate Sheryl Swoopes _ raising the emotional ante during a tense
exhibition game.
</P>
<P>
   ``Well, she chested me,'' Jackson said recently. ``I wasn't sure
what she did at first, but then I went back at her, like, `You want
a piece of me?' _ as the Americans like to do.
</P>
<P>
   ``She's a very good player, but I don't think she outplayed
me,'' Jackson said of Leslie. ``She got a lot of her points at the
end of the game, when it was over.''
</P>
<P>
   In the exhibition, Team USA's depth eventually wore down the
Opals, the nickname for the Australian national women's team. After
another uprising from the peasants, order was again restored to the
U.S. women's basketball universe.
</P>
<P>
   But for how long? As Jackson keeps maturing, as she transforms
herself into the most dangerous inside-outside threat the women's
game has known, while Nike plasters her image across the globe,
America's gold medal reign is no longer a given.
</P>
<P>
   Yes, the United States is 5-0 here entering their quarterfinal
with Slovakia Wednesday evening, but so is Team Australia, which
takes on Poland in the afternoon game. The two teams have a decent
shot of facing off in the gold medal match on Saturday at the Super
Dome in Olympic Park. Beyond the drama of the host nation trying to
knock off Goliath, the world will be treated to a glimpse of the
evolution of a superstar.
</P>
<P>
   ``After we played the Yanks, I felt so good after the game even
though we lost,'' Jackson said of the exhibition loss. ``I feel
we've got a real good chance of beating them.''
</P>
<P>
   Cocksure and quirky, Jackson is the daughter of the former
Australian national team players Gary and Maree Jackson. Her father
used to show her tapes of Wilt Chamberlain as a youngster, and
Lauren cried when she heard that the Hall of Fame center had died.
Along with the basketball pedigree, she possesses a crossover
appeal crucial to her sport's growth.
</P>
<P>
   ``She could be the Michael Jordan that women's basketball hasn't
yet had,'' said Michele Timms, a guard for Australia and a member
of the Phoenix Mercury in the Women's National Basketball
Association.
</P>
<P>
   In a way, Jackson is like any other 19-year-old, tugged at by
images and people competing for her time and attention. She listens
to the gothic rocker Marilyn Manson more than her elders do, and to
accompany the lightning bolt on her hip she had her country's flag
tattooed on her left arm.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not a dark person, contrary to some of the music I listen
to,'' she said, smiling. ``So please don't paint me that way. I'm
actually quite fun and upbeat about life. But I am a bit different,
I suppose.''
</P>
<P>
   On the court, she sets herself apart. Relentless inside, Jackson
leads the Opals in scoring and rebounding in the Olympic
tournament, using her quickness and skill to dominate. She has one
more season to fulfill a contractual obligation for her
professional team in Canberra, where she averaged 23.4 points last
season. She could be playing in the WNBA as early as next summer,
dropping in soft running jump shots in the key, spotting up from
behind the arc or maneuvering her sinewy frame along the baseline
for a reverse layup.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can't really go to my left and my defense is shocking, but I
am picking up many things about the game,'' she said last week.
</P>
<P>
   Leslie, the 27-year-old All-Star of the Los Angeles Sparks, has
called Jackson ``a future WNBA star, an awesome player.'' But she
bristles at the notion that a rivalry between the two exists. And
she disputes Jackson's account of their confrontation in Melbourne,
which carried over to the other end when Leslie made a strong
baseline drive only to have her shot sent to the floor by a leaping
Jackson.
</P>
<P>
   ``Maybe I misunderstood her,'' Leslie said, playing down the
encounter. ``Maybe our languages are different. I didn't hear that
at all.''
</P>
<P>
   She added: ``There is no rivalry until we play them. That's when
it matters.''
</P>
<P>
   Swoopes said: ``She's very competitive for her age, a great
player. But she also needs to understand, you're playing against
players who are better than you are and who could teach you
something. She shouldn't forget that.''
</P>
<P>
   Jackson forgets when the teen-ager within often gives way to the
ultracompetitive professional.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is one side to her that still loves to be a kid and
another that won't back down from anyone at anytime,'' said Kristi
Harrower, the Opals' point guard.
</P>
<P>
   ``She'll be one of the best players the world has ever seen,''
the Australian forward Michelle Griffiths said. ``She hasn't even
found her stripes yet. She hasn't even got the complete game yet. I
don't think the world has even touched the surface for Lauren
Jackson.''

KOSHER AND DELICIOUS 
</HEADLINE>
   (With KOSHER-RESTAURANTS)  
 By MELISSA CLARK   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Chefs who are finding new ways to make kosher food
stylish are not pushing the limits of dietary laws but instead are
simply rethinking their approach.
</P>
<P>
   Rather than looking to the traditional sources of inspiration,
like Eastern European or classic French cuisine, many are homing in
on Mediterranean cooking, which is not just trendy but surprisingly
well suited to kosher constraints. Il Patrizio, for instance,
serves pizza, roasted fish and vegetable appetizers like potatoes
with artichokes, spinach and Parmesan.
</P>
<P>
   ``Mediterranean food doesn't use much dairy,'' said Joseph
Amatruda of Prime Grill, ``so we can borrow freely from it, just as
long as we stay away from the shellfish dishes.'' He encrusts rack
of lamb with Syrian spices, for instance.
</P>
<P>
   Laura Frankel of Shallots said she is also focusing on the foods
of France, Spain, Italy, Morocco and Greece, which she said ``lend
themselves well to kosher cooking _ there's a lot of oil, fresh
herbs and lemon juice.'' One of her dishes is a red lentil soup
seasoned with Moroccan spices.
</P>
<P>
   These chefs are also tracking down versions of fashionable
ingredients that have been certified kosher. Amatruda has found
kosher nori wrappers, wasabi and rice for his sushi bar but says he
is still searching for kosher truffle oil and sherry wine vinegar.
</P>
<P>
   Frankel relies on the Internet to help her find kosher versions
of ingredients like chestnut flour and porcini powder.
</P>
<P>
   Neither substitutes margarine for butter to make their meat
meals kosher. For his mashed potatoes, Amatruda mixes in vegetable
or herb purees, or even plain olive oil, instead of butter. Frankel
does not make sauces finished with butter or cream but instead uses
infusions and reductions. ``It ends up healthier anyway,'' she
said.  &QL; 
PAN SAUTE OF ARTICHOKES, POTATOES, SPINACH AND PARMESAN  &QL; 
Adapted from Il Patrizio &QL; 
Time: 45 minutes  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   1 medium Idaho potato, peeled and cut into \-inch cubes
</P>
<P>
   12 baby artichokes, tough outer leaves removed, ends trimmed
</P>
<P>
   7 tablespoons extra virgin olive oil
</P>
<P>
   2 garlic cloves, thinly sliced
</P>
<P>
   1 large sprig fresh rosemary, minced
</P>
<P>
   6 tablespoons grated Parmesan cheese
</P>
<P>
   Salt and freshly ground pepper to taste
</P>
<P>
   1{ pounds spinach, washed and trimmed
</P>
<P>
   2 ripe tomatoes, seeded and cubed.
</P>
<P>
   1. In a pot of rapidly boiling water, cook potatoes until
tender, about 5 minutes. Drain and set aside.
</P>
<P>
   2. Thinly slice artichokes lengthwise. In a skillet over
medium-low heat, warm 6 tablespoons oil and gently saute
artichokes, half the garlic and the rosemary until artichokes are
tender, about 15-20 minutes. Add cooked potatoes and saute for 2
minutes. Stir in 2 tablespoons Parmesan and season with salt and
pepper.
</P>
<P>
   3. Meanwhile, in a skillet over medium heat, warm remaining
tablespoon oil and saute spinach with remaining garlic until
wilted, about 3 minutes. Stir in 2 tablespoons cheese and season
with salt and pepper.
</P>
<P>
   4. Spoon spinach into bottom of a 1-quart gratin dish. Divide
artichoke mixture among 4 6-ounce ramekins, packing it down very
hard. Let artichoke mixture cool in molds.
</P>
<P>
   5. Just before serving, heat oven to 500 degrees. Run a small
knife around sides of artichoke mixture in ramekins, then unmold
them on top of spinach. Sprinkle with remaining 2 tablespoons
Parmesan, and bake for 5 minutes, until cheese browns. Garnish with
tomatoes and serve. Yield: 4 servings.
</P>

IT'S NOT JUST THE TIME DIFFERENCE
</HEADLINE>
 By CARYN JAMES    
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   To much of the television audience _ especially the women and
other casual sports followers NBC claims to be eager to court _ the
Olympics is not an athletic event, but rather an entertainment
event that happens to be about sports. You wouldn't want to go to a
cocktail party and not know who Tiger Woods is. In theory, the
Olympics should produce the same need-to-know buzz. You wouldn't
want to go to a party and not know what was going on in Sydney.
</P>
<P>
   But to those of us watching at home, what's going on in Sydney
is an overproduced, misbegotten mess. This marathon of coverage
should have been as huge as ``Survivor,'' but is turning out to
more like ``Big Brother'': People only talk about it to say how
dull it is. The features are more mawkish than ever and the
competition coverage packaged in snippets so busy they make a music
video look leisurely.
</P>
<P>
   In its relentless search for high drama, NBC has stumbled into
high camp. One of its most memorable segments came early and may be
hard to top. ``It has been 6,000 years since man first forged a
relationship with the horse,'' Harry Smith said in a feature about
the equestrian competition, using the grandiose tone that puts the
development of the human-animal bond up there with the first cave
painting. ``The journey has brought us,'' he went on, (``us'' being
people and horses), ``together in a place called trust.''
</P>
<P>
   Some things, like the killer time difference, are beyond the
network's control. Knowing the results is unavoidable, even on NBC.
Typically, on Saturday's ``Today'' show, David Bloom warned viewers
to turn down the volume if they didn't want to know results; then
there was a picture of Marion Jones holding a gold medal. You think
she won?
</P>
<P>
   But NBC could have avoided its lethal mix: Features so
melodramatic they are unintentionally comic, and a style so choppy
it attenuates suspense instead of building it, so slick it is
nearly impossible to tell the commercials from the so-called
reporting.
</P>
<P>
   All the drama, of course, is artificially constructed half a day
after the fact. But it is constructed in a predictable pattern that
is already a parody of itself. Lead in with a 15-second travelogue
about Tasmania (with an Australian-accented narrator), go to Bob
Costas' introduction, a feature about a Chinese gymnast who sees
her parents only twice a year, then a snippet of an actual
competition, followed by a commercial and a medal ceremony for an
event that was covered a half-hour ago. Throw in yet another Marion
Jones profile (now with the endlessly replayed tape of her hulking,
weeping, shot-putter husband, C.J. Hunter, insisting he would never
disgrace his wife and kids by using banned drugs no matter what
those positive test results suggest), and you have a recipe for
disastrous coverage.
</P>
<P>
   After Cathy Freeman's gold-medal winning race on Monday, there
was a commercial, a few minutes of women's pole vaulting, then
Freeman's medal ceremony. But there was a mere glimpse of her
wearing both the Australian and Aboriginal flags on her victory
lap, which should have provided more drama.
</P>
<P>
   Wait long enough and dig hard enough and you'll run across an
athletic feat that is both awe-inspiring and emotional, like Laura
Wilkinson's unexpected gold-medal dive. But watching television
shouldn't be that much work. NBC's producers have made a mistake
any music video director would have been be able to avoid: Being
busier doesn't make a show more interesting, just more cluttered,
and the viewing experience becomes claustrophobic and annoying.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   NBC, of course, has to justify the $705 million it has spent for
these games. It has not only spread each night's coverage over five
grueling hours, it has also held several of the Americans'
gold-medal winning races until after 11 p.m. ET. In track, Marion
Jones and Maurice Greene were seen winning gold medals after 11; in
the men's 50-meter freestyle, in which the swimmers and training
partners Gary Hall Jr. and Anthony Ervin dramatically shared the
gold medal, Costas set up the event, broke for local news, then
returned for the race after 11:30.
</P>
<P>
   This is not some juggling act meant to accommodate East and West
Coast viewers at once. The network sends three feeds to the
different time zones, as with any prime-time presentation. The
strategy, another backfire, is meant to lure viewers into the last
hour, in which there has been a fall-off in the ratings.
</P>
<P>
   Making the Olympics appealing to a broader television audience
is, of course, about constructing celebrities. The commentators are
now dancing around the public relations damage to Jones, their best
hope for stardom, and saying they hope the accusations against her
husband won't be ``a distraction.''
</P>
<P>
   Yet even the star-making machinery is oddly out of touch, with
huge streaks of lingering Cold War mentality and sexism. The
American swimmer Lenny Krayzelburg is one of the most appealing
personalities, low-key, modest and good-looking. One of the many
features about him _ born in Odessa, moved to California _ began,
``He's known life behind the Iron Curtain and in the land of
opportunity.'' When is the last time you heard the term Iron
Curtain used with a straight face?
</P>
<P>
   And after Amy van Dyken spit in Inge de Bruijn's lane, one of
two male swimming commentators noted that ``Inge hissed at her like
a cat.'' The other commentator said, ``I guess this IS going to be
a catfight.'' To the commentators, Gary Hall was cute when he
taunted the Australian swimmers that he would crush them like a
guitar; the women were being catty. That's not the smartest way to
attract female viewers. (And NBC wonders why critics hiss at them.)
</P>
<P>
   Viewers aren't fools. We can tell the difference between Michael
Johnson's race and his commercial for a digital phone service, in
which he runs with a cell phone in his hand and says, ``Hey, coach,
we did it.'' But the Olympics shouldn't be so much like those
familiar commercials that they are just as easy to ignore.
</P>
<P>
   There are alternatives. (Not the CBC's live coverage; all of
Canada is not watching at 5 in the morning.) On MSNBC during the
day, events like men's and women's baseball and rowing have been
unfolding in a leisurely way, with fewer features, like a sports
event instead of a badly packaged show.
</P>
<P>
   But prime time is what matters, and even though those evening
ratings have crept up in the past few days, marginal improvement
doesn't count for much in the midst of so much that has been
botched.
</P>
<P>
   Even a feature about ``The Star-Spangled Banner'' was out of
touch with reality. The song, the report says, ``vaporizes all
cynicism.'' Have they been listening? Instead of a stirring
version, the official Olympic rendition of our national anthem has
a fast-paced ``Play ball!'' style.
</P>
<P>
   Something should be vaporized here, but it's not cynicism; the
cookie cutter for this stale Olympic coverage is the thing that
should vanish. &QL;

THE PEN LED BY THE NOSE 
</HEADLINE>
   By   ERIC ASIMOV   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   As satirists know, the language for describing wines can reach
pretentious and even absurd heights. Recently, I enjoyed a
description of a port with a ``fumy, high-toned nose.'' Yet wine
does present an awkward problem: the vocabulary for describing
subtle differences in smells and flavors is imprecise. So wine
experts have to describe by analogy.
</P>
<P>
   Some of their more bizarre descriptions seem nonsensical. Would
anybody really want to drink wine that smells like road tar, wet
rocks or gasoline? What about cured meat, tobacco or sweat, or even
what can politely be called cat's litter box? Of course not. Yet
these terms, when taken in the context of a spectrum of sensory
impressions, can be surprisingly accurate.
</P>
<P>
   For example, as German rieslings age, they sometimes get a
pronounced aroma that suggests fuel to me. Rieslings can also have
mineral smells. The Lingenfelder here has a smell like wet river
rocks, or to be more urban, the sidewalk after a morning rain.
</P>
<P>
   Italian reds are often troves of strange smells. The Roccaccia
here has a meaty, almost sweaty aroma, like that of boiled
cotechino sausage. The Zenner, like many other Sicilian and
southern Italian wines, has a smoky aroma that reminds me of tar, a
smell I like. Bordeaux, particularly well-aged wines from Pauillac
and Graves, smell legendarily like tobacco and cedar. The
Pontet-Canet '97 gives a hint of that.
</P>
<P>
   As for that litterbox, it is meant to describe a piercing
pungency that sauvignon blancs sometimes achieve. There is even a
New Zealand wine that celebrates this odor with humor, calling
itself Cat's Phee on a Gooseberry Bush, gooseberry being the other
obscure aroma in sauvignon blanc. Smells more like cold metal and
lemon to me.  &QL;

&HT;     NEW MATH: ONE BLUNDER PLUS ONE BLUNDER EQUALS 49ERS 
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 &HT;     By RAY RATTO  
 &HT;     c.2000 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ Terrell Owens ought to be angry with the San
Francisco 49ers. He ought to be downright livid.
</P>
<P>
   Not because he was suspended for a week. That one, he has to
eat. And not because he lost $24,000 and change with the
suspension. I mean, what's money to a millionaire like him?
</P>
<P>
   No, the bone he has to pick with Steve Mariucci, his teammates
and the 49ers organization relates to a far more damning act than
his desecration of the Dallas Cowboys star.
</P>
<P>
   Namely, the fact that nobody in a position of authority bothers
to notice a new and unique touchdown celebration any longer. I
mean, what's an artist got to do?
</P>
<P>
   Owens scored twice in Sunday's 41-24 win, the first by the 49ers
in about forever. He also celebrated twice in a most unusual way _
by running from the end zone, past all his teammates, to stand on
the star and raise his hands to God.
</P>
<P>
   Or Don Hutson. We're not sure which.
</P>
<P>
   Anyway, the second celebration, the one that drew such a cranky
reaction from Dallas safety George Teague, is the one that caused
Mariucci to apologize to every 49er, living or dead, and to suspend
Owens for this Sunday's dead-calm game against Arizona.
</P>
<P>
   But an odd thing happened as Mariucci was crawling so fervently
toward the high moral ground. He said he didn't see the first Owens
celebration, which lasted longer and started all the trouble.
</P>
<P>
   Not only that, none of his assistant coaches saw it. None of the
other players saw it. None of the 49er brass upstairs at Texas
Stadium saw it. Nobody, except a few million people who know how to
find Fox on their television dial.
</P>
<P>
   Worse yet, nobody thought to mention it to anyone in authority
at the time.
</P>
<P>
   So of course Owens is torqued off. Playing in Jerry Rice's
shadow ... embarking on what looks to be an extended stay below the
.500 line ... struggling to find an identity for himself ... and
when he finally creates a signature move, nobody is watching.
</P>
<P>
   Most people who claim to know Mariucci believe his story that he
didn't see Owens' first salute to the star. OK, fine, we'll give
him that one. And it is certainly reasonable to think that
offensive coordinator Marty Mornhinweg was too busy to notice, and
that special teams coach George Stewart was occupied hustling the
conversion team onto the field.
</P>
<P>
   Not everybody has the time to appreciate the Terpsichore, after
all.
</P>
<P>
   But nobody? Not one person on the 49ers' payroll?
</P>
<P>
   Surely someone in a position of influence must have caught it.
Owens was getting his head booed off by the angry Dallas crowd,
which ought to be sufficient tipoff.
</P>
<P>
   And if it was wrong the second time, surely it was wrong the
first time. If you buy all that 49ers winning-with-class stuff,
anyway. That ``class'' thing has always been set to a flexible
standard, anyway; winning comes first through sixth, and the class
comes later.
</P>
<P>
   Imagine all the good that could have been done if someone had
told Owens after the first one, ``Bad move there, T.O. You're gonna
start a fight, we're going to have to back your play, and someone
could end up with an accordioned knee. Someone you know and care
about. Someone like, say, me. So stop now while you still have us
at your back.''
</P>
<P>
   But no, everybody with a 49ers logo on his or her shorts was off
going through playbooks for the next grand scheme, throwing down a
congratulatory wine spritzer, hitting the john or knitting a wool
cap for winter.
</P>
<P>
   That's a head coach, a dozen assistants, 53 players,
miscellaneous trainers and equipment men, two public relations
guys, some front office bigshots, two broadcasters and Skippy the
engineer. They all missed Owens' first big moment, thus causing the
second big moment, thus causing all this flap.
</P>
<P>
   So Terrell Owens has a beef, and a legitimate one. What does he
have to do the next time he scores, lift his leg against the goal
post? Grab a baby out of the stands and take a victory lap?
Spontaneously combust?
</P>
<P>
   There are only so many ways to celebrate a score, and most of
them are taken already. Is it asking too much to notice when
someone comes up with something new, even if it is only insulting
and incendiary?
</P>
<P>
   No, I say, it is not. So you keep thinking, T.O., and let your
creativity take wing. And if you seize on something really radical,
like laying the ball down in the end zone, or handing it to an
official, you'll have at least one person watching you. Never mind
the distracted philistines you work for. They don't appreciate a
great mime when they see one.
</P>
<P>
   Or, they claim, when they don't see one.

 &HT;    KEEPING MEDICARE BENEFITS WILL REQUIRE A TAX HIKE, EXPERTS SAY
 &HT;    By LARRY LIPMAN
 &HT;    c.2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ None of the leading proposals for reforming
Medicare will fully solve its long-range financial problems,
meaning taxpayers will have to pay more for future benefits, a
nonpartisan panel of experts reported Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Because of an expected doubling in the number of elderly people,
longer life spans and rising medical costs, Medicare will need a
111 percent increase in tax revenues in order to provide the same
level of benefits by the year 2030 as in 1998, said the report by
the National Academy of Social Insurance.
</P>
<P>
   Using the projected federal budget surplus, cutting costs
through a more efficient delivery of services, or relying on more
competitive pricing of premiums will not solve the long-range
problem, the panel concluded.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, the experts agreed it will take a combination of
factors _ including higher taxes _ to meet the long-term needs of
the federal program that provides health care to more than 39
million elderly and disabled Americans.
</P>
<P>
   ``While a robust economy and new cost containment measures have
substantially improved Medicare's financial outlook, Medicare will
still require significant additional revenues if we are to offer
Baby Boomers the type of coverage enjoyed by current
beneficiaries,'' said Marilyn Moon in a statement accompanying the
report.
</P>
<P>
   Moon, a former trustee of the Social Security and Medicare trust
funds, headed the 12-member panel, which brought together experts
with a broad spectrum of political views.
</P>
<P>
   Panel members declined to speculate on how much money will need
to be raised to keep Medicare solvent in the coming decades.
Instead, they estimated the share of Medicare costs as a percentage
of the nation's gross domestic product.
</P>
<P>
   Noting that Medicare will spend an anticipated $3.4 trillion
over the next 10 years, Moon said the amount of money that will be
needed by 2030 is ``a big, big number.''
</P>
<P>
   The future of Medicare has become a pivotal issue in the
presidential and congressional campaigns. Both presidential
candidates Vice President Al Gore and Gov. George W. Bush, have
offered plans for reforming Medicare while providing a
pharmaceutical drug benefit.
</P>
<P>
   Although the panel did not specifically review either the Gore
or Bush proposals, it analyzed several major reform proposals that
have been advocated on Capitol Hill and among health care experts.
</P>
<P>
   Among those proposals was one offered last year to the
Bipartisan Commission on the Future of Medicare by Sen. John
Breaux, D-La., and Rep. Bill Thomas, R-Calif. In it, the government
would subsidize the average cost of competing private Medicare
insurance plans. That proposal, which was not formally adopted by
the commission, has been the basis for bipartisan legislation in
Congress and is a key feature of the reform plan offered by Bush,
the Republican candidate.
</P>
<P>
   The academy panel predicted that the Breaux-Thomas proposal
would fall 86 percent short of money needed from taxpayers by 2030.
</P>
<P>
   Adding a prescription drug benefit with a $2,000 cap on
out-of-pocket expenditures by beneficiaries would increase the need
for additional taxes by 171 percent. Gore, the Democratic
candidate, has proposed a $4,000 cap on out-of-pocket prescription
drug expenditures, while Bush has proposed a $6,000 cap which would
eventually cover all Medicare out-of-pocket expenditures.
</P>
<P>
   Gore's Medicare proposal _ which he has outlined in greater
detail this week _ would rely on a ``lock box'' provision that
would ensure that the projected federal surplus is used to finance
the Medicare trust fund.
</P>
<P>
   But academy members said the lock box would not solve Medicare's
future financing problem.
</P>
<P>
   ``It will help to pay down the current debt, and it will mean
that, in the future, if you decide to increase the debt again, it
will make it easier to do so,'' said Sheila Burke, a panel member
and former longtime aide to Sen. Bob Dole of Kansas, the GOP's 1996
presidential candidate.
</P>
<P>
   Efforts to expand Medicare by offering it to those 55 and older,
as Gore proposes, or providing prescription drug benefits as both
Gore and Bush propose, will further exacerbate the program's
long-term financial problems, the panel said.
</P>
<P>
   Panel members suggested a series of options to begin meeting
future financing needs including:
</P>
<P>
   _ Raising the payroll tax, which is equally shared by employers
and employees, from 2.9 percent to 4.84 percent. A worker making
$35,000 would see an increase from $508 to $847 a year; the
employer would pay a similar increase.
</P>
<P>
   _ Adding an 8.43 percent surcharge on income taxes. That would
increase the taxes of a family with an income of $34,900 (below the
national median) by $494, based on 1999 figures.
</P>
<P>
   _ Establish a national 2.02 percent consumption tax on all goods
and services except housing, financial services and some labor. A
family with a $25,000 income would pay roughly $500 in consumption
taxes. If food, medical care and other necessities were excluded,
the rate would increase to 3.29 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Academy members acknowledged that getting the public to accept
the need for higher taxes to finance Medicare will be difficult.
Recent rosy projections have delayed the impending date for
Medicare to become insolvent to 2025.
</P>
<P>
   ``The public doesn't perceive that there is a crisis, but I
think policy makers are beginning to understand it,'' Burke said.

SPORTS OF THE TIMES: MESSIN' WITH THE GOLDEN COW 
</HEADLINE>
   By WILLIAM C. RHODEN

<P>
   SYDNEY, Australia _ They entered the room holding hands. Marion
Jones, one of the world's greatest sprinters, and her husband, C.J.
Hunter, were, fairly or unfairly, coming off as the world's biggest
jerks.
</P>
<P>
   The hastily arranged news conference was put together in the
wake of news reports that Hunter, a world-class shot-putter, had
tested positive for performance-enhancing drugs.
</P>
<P>
   After a series of Team Nike meetings it had been decided: Hunter
would go out front and face the music. As one Nike official put it,
``You define the situation, don't allow the situation to define
you.''
</P>
<P>
   Marion did not wear a Nike Swoosh Tuesday. No warmups. Tuesday
she was a partner in marriage. There are times when one partner
gives 90 percent. This was one of those times.
</P>
<P>
   ``As you all know, this has been very difficult, the past couple
of days for C.J. and I,'' Jones began. ``I am here pretty much to
show my complete support for my husband. Aside from him being an
athlete and me being an athlete, he's my husband and I'm here to
show support for him. I believe that the legal system will do
what's needed to be done to clear his name.''
</P>
<P>
   Jones is attempting to accomplish the feat of her life here, one
of the greatest feats in Olympic history. She is attempting to win
five gold medals. She has already won the 100 meters with ease and
was to begin her quest for the 200 in a preliminary heat here
Wednesday night.
</P>
<P>
   Tuesday she appealed to the news media for understanding. ``I
hope that all of you would respect the fact that I am competing
here in the Sydney Games. I have four more events to do. So if we
cannot get anymore phone calls to our hotel, we would really,
really appreciate that.''
</P>
<P>
   With that Jones stood up, kissed Hunter and left. Next to Jones,
who is natural, charismatic, bright and jubilant, Hunter looked as
he often looks: uncomfortable.
</P>
<P>
   For the next 15 minutes Hunter explained and re-explained his
position. ``I may not be the most agreeable person and I might be
downright mean at times, but nobody on the planet can say that I
don't love my wife and I don't love my kids,'' Hunter said through
tears. ``I would never ever do anything to jeopardize her opinion
of me. Track and field has never been that important to me where
I'd do something like this.''
</P>
<P>
   The veil of suspicion is so thick, so all encompassing and, in
Hunter's case, so unforgiving. One writer pointedly asked Hunter:
Whether you were taking the steroid or not, does that excuse the
fact that you had a level in your system that exceeded what was
allowed? Everyone knew, including Hunter, the writer said, that you
can't have that stuff in your blood.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you had listened to anything that was said, if it was in a
supplement, how would I know it was in the supplement?'' Hunter
responded. ``Nothing says calcium and nandrolone, it's calcium.
</P>
<P>
   ``So am I reasonably expected to take every supplement I buy?''
Hunter asked rhetorically. ``Find someone to test it and then take
it? Is that what I'm expected to do?''
</P>
<P>
   The answer is yes, if it keeps your wife focused on the greatest
event of her life. In hindsight, Hunter should have left the sport
in this Olympic year while Jones competed. He should have taken a
year off to become her fulltime Rock of Gibraltar. He told me last
summer that he did the shot because he was good at it, not because
he loved it.
</P>
<P>
   ``The only reason I do this, the reason I come,'' he said
Tuesday, ``is to be able to fly for free.''
</P>
<P>
   They have earned enough for Hunter to pay his own air fare. If
Jones wins the five gold medals, they won't have to pay for a
flight from now till kingdom come.
</P>
<P>
   Tuesday someone asked how long he had been carrying the news of
his positive drug test around? Hunter balked. ``One of the things
that we're not going to do is get into any questions that are going
to cause conflict with the IOC, the IAAF or the USOC,'' he said,
referring to the world and American governing bodies of the
Olympics and track and field. ``We're going to take the information
we have, we're going to take it through the proper channels.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm going to defend myself vigorously. We've put together a
great team,'' Hunter said. ``And I'm quite positive that when
everything is said and done ,I'll be exonerated. And your opinions
will be totally different.''
</P>
<P>
   C.J. Hunter and his camp knew in July about the positive tests.
Jones did not find out until two days ago when the news leaked from
the International Olympic Committee here in Australia. A Nike
official confirmed that Hunter knew about this in July. Through
back-and-forth conversations with the IAAF, members of the Jones
camp were confident that the matter would not surface until the
Games ended. They miscalculated. Hunter cried Tuesday.
Intentionally or not, he knew that he had compromised his wife, put
his family in an awkward and embarrassing position.
</P>
<P>
   The end result is that for Jones' competitors, the playing field
just became level. For Marion Jones, the phrase in her wedding vows
_ ``For better or for worse'' _ has assumed a whole new meaning.

   SYDNEY, Australia _ It has been said that into everyone's life a
little rain must fall. Tuesday, under bleak skies in Sydney Harbor,
it descended on the U.S. skipper Russ Silvestri and his two dozen
opponents in the Finn single-handed dinghy class as the second week
of the Olympic sailing competition continued.
</P>
<P>
   After four previous races in the 11-race series, Silvestri, a
38-year-old investment banker from San Francisco, started the day
in seventh place. When it was over, after a second-place finish and
a 16th in the other pair of races sailed in cool, southerly winds
that peaked at about 15 knots and ultimately fell to a mere zephyr,
he had moved up a notch to sixth.
</P>
<P>
   Britain's Iain Percy, who began the day as the overall leader,
continued to sail a consistent series with fifth- and sixth-place
finishes and, just past the midway point of the regatta, is
maintaining a hefty lead.
</P>
<P>
   Silvestri acknowledged his day had been up and down.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the first race everything that could go right went right,''
he said. ``It gave me a lot of confidence. I thought I had it all
figured out. But it backfired a bit on the second race.''
</P>
<P>
   With 27 points, Percy is 13 points ahead of Fredrik Loof of
France, in second. In the Olympic sailing competition, sailors
receive points for the order in which they finish each race. The
low score wins.
</P>
<P>
   Even though Silvestri, with 56 points, remains in medal
contention, the U.S. sailing team's results thus far have been, at
best, mixed. In the 49er class competition, which finished Monday,
the Seattle brothers Jonathan and Charlie McKee earned bronze
medals. And Wednesday, with one race left in their respective
divisions, the men's 470 team of Paul Foerster and Bob Merrick, and
the women's 470 duo of J.J. Isler and Pease Glaser, have a good
chance at either silver or bronze medals.
</P>
<P>
   But the Soling team skippered by Jeff Madrigali was eliminated
early. And another pre-Games medal favorite, the Star boat helmed
by Mark Reynolds, is a distant seventh at the midway point of that
series. The U.S. Tornado team, and the men's and women's
boardsailing entries, whose racing has ended, all finished out of
the money.
</P>
<P>
   In the opening week of competition the weather was probably too
ideal, as the sunny, early spring conditions were accompanied by
minimal breeze. The weather has changed, however, and on Course D,
just inside the prominent Heads that guard the harbor entrance _
the site of Tuesday's Finn sailing, and one of six available racing
circles _ the day's first race began in a chilly downpour.
</P>
<P>
   Storm clouds are nothing new to Silvestri, who won a spot on the
U.S. team for the 1984 Games but then lost it because of a rules
protest. So he is enjoying his first Olympic experience, the
highlight of which so far has been leading the fleet to the first
turning mark in the opening race of the series.
</P>
<P>
   ``That was pretty exciting,'' he said. ``I was getting
teary-eyed.''
</P>
<P>
   Silvestri didn't repeat that performance Tuesday, but he managed
an excellent start just to windward of the defending Olympic
champion, Mateusz Kusznierewicz of Poland, and parlayed that into a
second-place result. Xavier Rohart of France was first.
</P>
<P>
   By the start of the second race the rain had halted, but the
breeze was extremely fluky.
</P>
<P>
   ``You get little rivers of wind here and there,'' Silvestri
said. ``If you're in the right place you get them. If not, you
don't. Sometimes you're on the good elevator, and sometimes you're
on the bad one.''
</P>
<P>
   Halfway through the race, Silvestri was holding ninth. But on
the last downwind leg, he picked the wrong corridor. ``The guys on
the right smoked me,'' he said. ``And the guys on the left smoked
me, too.''
</P>
<P>
   Drifting across the finish line in the dying breeze, Silvestri
was 15 places behind the winner, David Burrows of Ireland.
</P>
<P>
   Although Percy has a solid lock on the lead, it has been a
surprising series. After Tuesday's racing, Kusznierewicz, a
dominant sailor who was last year's International Sailing
Federation sailor of the year, is fourth.
</P>
<P>
   And after waiting 16 years for his Olympic moment, Silvestri is
not yet willing to concede defeat.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the real light air I think I'm a little vulnerable, but in
anything over 5 knots I think I'm going pretty good,'' he said.
``Percy's been fabulous, but second and third are still wide open.
If I don't get cocky, there are still a lot of races to go.''

   ``Pagan Babies''
</P>
<P>
   by Elmore Leonard
</P>
<P>
   Mystery
</P>
<P>
   Delacorte, $24.95
</P>
<P>
   _
</P>
<P>
   Father Terry Dunn is a scotch-swilling, pot-puffing priest with
a slinky one-armed housekeeper, a Rwandan church full of dead
bodies and a couple of dirty little secrets in his shadowy past.
</P>
<P>
   Wait a second.
</P>
<P>
   Is Father Terry really a priest, or is he a fugitive felon? Or
both? Or neither? And is the sultry Chantelle really a housekeeper
or a harlot? Or both?
</P>
<P>
   Or neither?
</P>
<P>
   With ``Pagan Babies,'' Elmore Leonard has struck again. That is
to say, he's created another weird plot and peopled it with equally
outrageous and unforgettable characters.
</P>
<P>
   And nobody's quite what he or she appears to be.
</P>
<P>
   Things begin to really liven up with Father Terry's sudden, but
quite timely, departure (escape?) from Africa, and his
serendipitous rendezvous in Detroit with super-cool legal
investigator Debbie Dewey.
</P>
<P>
   The irrepressible Ms. Dewey is just freshly removed from a
three-year stint at Florida's Sawgrass Correctional for assault
with a deadly weapon _ a rent car.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was visiting my mom in Florida and happened to run into my
ex-husband _ in a Buick Riviera,'' she says, telling the story for
laughs. Real laughs. Outside prison walls, she is trying to make it
now as a stand-up comic using _ you guessed it _ prison humor.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a rental, but it did the job,'' she deadpans.
</P>
<P>
   Actually, it wasn't her ex-husband, but her ex-boyfriend, Randy,
and it was a Ford Escort and not a Buick Riviera, but she was
hugely successful in putting Randy in a body cast. What's more,
she's eager to resume exacting her revenge on the womanizing snake,
who scammed her for a total of $67,000.
</P>
<P>
   Back in Detroit, Father Terry is also casting about for a huge
bundle of cash, ostensibly for the starving children of Rwanda.
</P>
<P>
   Whatever, the mysterious priest and the comely comedienne share
not only common agendas but a splendidly sardonic wit and whatever
bed happens to be handy.
</P>
<P>
   Soon, everyone's mixed up with gangsters, con artists, crazies
and killers, most memorably a hit man named Mutt, who offs his
targets with borrowed weapons and only minimal rancor.
</P>
<P>
   There is this wonderfully Leonardesque exchange between Mutt and
small-town mobster Johnny Pajonny:
</P>
<P>
   Mobster: ``I know a guy at Jackson (prison) was a hit man. He
got ten grand a pop.''
</P>
<P>
   Mutt: ``I get more'n that.'' (He's just agreed to a $500 hit.)
</P>
<P>
   Mobster: ``You must be good at it. ... You say you took out a
truck driver, a convict and one other guy?''
</P>
<P>
   Mutt: `` ... Guy wouldn't pay his street tax.''
</P>
<P>
   Mobster: ``You didn't shoot the convict?''
</P>
<P>
   Mutt: ``No, I shanked him.''
</P>
<P>
   Mobster: ``So you only actually shot two guys?''
</P>
<P>
   Mutt: ``Yeah, but I got one coming up.''
</P>
<P>
   For reasons best left unexplained, Mutt is recruited by wretched
Randy to dispose of Father Terry, and amid all manner of mayhem the
saga hurtles toward a hilarious, yet suspenseful, close.
</P>
<P>
   This one will surprise even those legions of Leonard fans who
have come to expect the unexpected.
</P>
<P>
   As pointed out earlier, Elmore Leonard has struck again. And
this time, as with ``Get Shorty,'' a superb earlier novel, he's
struck pure gold.

   ``You're Too Kind: A Brief History of Flattery''
</P>
<P>
   by Richard Stengel
</P>
<P>
   Sociology
</P>
<P>
   Simon &AMP; Schuster, $25
</P>
<P>
   _
</P>
<P>
   Flattery is more than just kissing up to someone. It is, in
fact, a vital part of our lives, culture and civilization. At
least, that's the premise of ``You're Too Kind: A Brief History of
Flattery,'' by Richard Stengel.
</P>
<P>
   If you're open to that concept _ and surely you are, since you
are one of those very special open-minded individuals who reads the
Books section _ this is an interesting, entertaining and perhaps
even enlightening few hundred pages. Plus, Stengel's writing is
sharp and amusing.
</P>
<P>
   For most, ``flattery'' suggests images of blowing smoke,
toadyism, sycophancy and brown-nosing. But we can't all be king, or
even a mid-level boss.
</P>
<P>
   Stengel believes status hierarchies are endemic in nature, and
that flattery is the accepted technique for raising your status.
Even if the flattery is transparent, the mere attempt is usually
worth a few points, he writes.
</P>
<P>
   You can overthrow the boss, king, queen or whatever. But this
usually involves some kind of confrontation, sometimes a bloody
one. The alternative is to make your situation as pleasant, or at
least as tolerable, as possible.
</P>
<P>
   ``Evolution seems to have ultimately favored sycophantic weenies
over self-reliant bruisers, the Uriah Heeps and Eddie Haskells and
Dick Morrises over the Samsons and the Schwarzeneggers,'' Stengel
writes. ``Smooth talk trumps brute strength every day of the
week.''
</P>
<P>
   This history begins with primates. Winning the alpha male's
favor means better food for other males, and access to choice
females. Stengel suggests that flattery may be biological ``because
it helps you get your genes into the next generation.''
</P>
<P>
   Where office flatterers compliment the boss on a new suit, a new
car or lost weight, chimpanzees have to pick nits off their alpha's
backside. But the effect is the same.
</P>
<P>
   In today's world, workers employ flattery to acquire better
income, which results in a better car, better house and, thus, a
better sexual partner more likely to carry the flatterer's genes
forward.
</P>
<P>
   Other chapters delve into the subgroups of royal flattery,
personal flattery and political flattery.
</P>
<P>
   If nothing else, the book puts flattery into perspective. At its
most basic, it helps us all ``get along.'' We all do it, even
really wonderful people like you who read what I write. Feel free
to present your fleas for my immediate attention.

her own life, is a chilling tale depicting a world with which most
of us are only vaguely familiar. Coelho explores mental illness and
life within the walls of a psychiatric institution with surreal
detail and intimacy, such as only a been-there-done-that type of
writer could accomplish. The book, we are told, is based on events
in the author's own life.
</P>
<P>
   Coelho's quiet, unadorned style produces effects as compelling
as the shock treatments he describes. Though Villete is a
fictitious institution, it is easy to forget the place isn't real,
especially when Coelho makes a third-person appearance early in the
story. He declares he will tell Veronika's story because he, too,
has been locked up, and he feels compelled to expose the ``madmen
who run lunatic asylums.'' But if the novel begins as Coelho's
personal vendetta, he settles for the role of fly-on-the-wall. The
story takes on a life of its own.
</P>
<P>
   The curtain rises with Veronika _ 24 years old, beautiful,
gifted and loved by family and friends _ overdosing on sleeping
pills. She hopes to end the inexplicable ``void'' in her life.
Instead of dying, she comes to in a psychiatric hospital. She's
told that she has caused irreversible damage to her heart, and that
she has less than a week to live.
</P>
<P>
   Veronika decides to permit intensity of feeling to dictate those
final days. This leads her to indulge in all sorts of bizarre
``truthful'' behavior, including slapping an elderly hospital
inmate who appears to have ridiculed her and performing sexual
antics in the presence of a young man whom she physically desires,
but who is unable to reciprocate.
</P>
<P>
   At one point, Veronika plays piano with such ferocious intensity
that she stirs up dormant emotions in other patients. One of them
is Eduard, the same young man who refused to have sex with her
(although he is mesmerized by her piano playing). Said to be
afflicted with a ``rare'' type of schizophrenia, Eduard was
hospitalized following a breakdown, one apparently prompted by
pressure from overbearing parents who forbade him to pursue art _
not unlike Coelho's own experience. Other patients touched by
Veronika's antics include Mari, a middle-aged lawyer, whose husband
has committed her because of a severe panic disorder, and Zedka,
whose depression is being treated with insulin shots.
</P>
<P>
   The time span for the story is all of five days. The setting is
inside an asylum. But within that framework, the narrative weaves
back and forth, encompassing past and present. The main focus is on
Veronika, but the minor players are superbly fleshed out, and help
readers feel they have entered a very real world that operates by
its own rules and eerie ``normalcy.'' Not the least among the cast
are the shadowy figures of Dr. Igor, whose patients serve as
research guinea pigs, and Igor's retinue of nurses and aides, all
of them brandishing their arsenal of syringes and straitjackets.
</P>
<P>
   ``Veronika Decides to Die'' winds down with an unexpected twist,
which makes you wonder if the crazy practices at Villete are to be
condemned or condoned. Coelho brings the story to a very fluid
closure, and, ultimately, wants readers to draw their own
conclusions.

   YUGO-ELECTIONS (Belgrade, Yugoslavia) _ The
government-controlled Federal Election Commission announced on
Tuesday night that President Slobodan Milosevic had won enough
votes to force a second-round runoff for the presidency against
challenger Vojislav Kostunica, challenging Kostunica's claim of an
outright victory in the first round of voting on Sunday. Opposition
leaders immediately called the commission figures fraudulent and
said they would insist that Kostunica had won without the need for
a runoff, which would take place on Oct. 8. By Steven Erlanger.

<P>
   IMF-WORLDBANK (Prague, Czech Republic) _ Black-masked protesters
hurled cobblestones ripped from Prague's medieval streets and
attacked police with homemade gasoline bombs, trying desperately,
and ultimately unsuccessfully, to shut down a global finance
meeting here. Riot police had to escort government ministers
attending the annual conference of the International Monetary Fund
and World Bank into special subways cars to whisk them away from
their meeting at day's end. The violence, which both police and
many protesters said was provoked by squadrons of European
anarchists and communists, did not stop the meetings. By Joseph
Kahn.

   LOCKERBIE-TRIAL (Camp Zeist, the Netherlands) _ The Libyan
double agent considered the most crucial witness in the Lockerbie
trial testified on Tuesday that the two defendants brought to Malta
a brown Samsonite suitcase like the one believed to contain the
bomb that destroyed Pan Am Flight 103. But in his testimony, which
lasted less than one day, the witness never said he saw a bomb put
into the suitcase or the suitcase put aboard a flight. He also did
not say that either defendant had admitted the bombing to him. By

Tuesday, a joint session of the Senate Judiciary and Intelligence

A DREAM OF ZINFANDEL, DELIVERED TO THE DOOR  
 VIA AIR MAIL IN SOME ESTATES 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Va., Texas, Fla., N.C., Utah)   By   FRANK J. PRIAL   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Every year around this time, the mail brings a raft of notices
from California's small exclusive wineries offering their latest
vintage. The wines are listed with prices, and an address to which
I should send my check.
</P>
<P>
   There's only one problem: they won't sell me any wine. There are
29 states to which it is illegal to ship wine directly to a
consumer from another state. I live in one of them, New Jersey, and
work in another, New York.
</P>
<P>
   These laws are strongly supported by the liquor and wine
wholesalers and by most retailers. They are terrified that the
Internet, through which most of these direct sales are made, is
going to put them out of business. The states support these laws
for fear that direct shipping will elude their taxes.
</P>
<P>
   I might not be so exercised over all this if, with the mails
blocked to me, I could slip around to my local marchand du vin and
buy the wine there.
</P>
<P>
   But I can't.
</P>
<P>
   In the last 40 years, the number of liquor wholesalers has
shrunk by a staggering 97 percent. While their numbers have
dwindled, the number of wineries has exploded. There are more than
800 in California alone, producing some 4,000 different wines. The
wholesalers are more interested in volume than variety, and that
leaves most people without access to some of best small producers
in the country.
</P>
<P>
   As a result, hundreds of small wineries, desperate for an
outlet, have turned to the Internet and mail order, but they find
themselves largely stymied there as well.
</P>
<P>
   Understandably, the frustrated wine makers and their customers
have begun to fight back. They are finding a sympathetic ear in
some courts. In the past year, wineries and consumers have filed
lawsuits in six states asserting that to single out wine for
special controls is discriminatory, a restraint of trade and a
violation of the Interstate Commerce Clause, which grants Congress
the exclusive authority to regulate commerce among states.
</P>
<P>
   In two of the suits, in Indiana and Texas, the plaintiffs won.
On Sept. 13, the 7th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals overturned the
Indiana decision, a ruling that a spokeswoman for the Wine and
Spirits Wholesalers of America, Juanita Duggan, called ``a major
step forward for the state officials who are trying to prevent
out-of-state alcohol shippers from evading taxes and selling wine,
liquor and beer without checking IDs.''
</P>
<P>
   John DeLuca, the president of the Wine Institute, a trade group
that deals with legislation and consumer issues affecting the wine
industry, said that the decision seemed to be based mostly on
courtroom technicalities. A consumer group, the Informal Coalition
to Preserve Consumer Access to Wine, noted that with laws being
challenged in New York, Virginia, Texas, Florida and North
Carolina, ``the 7th Circuit opinion will certainly not be the last
word on this issue.''
</P>
<P>
   A week earlier, the U.S. District Court in the Southern District
of New York denied a motion by the wholesalers' lawyers to dismiss
the New York suit. New York liquor laws make it illegal to ship or
advertise wine in the state without a license. Out-of-state
wineries are ineligible for licenses. In allowing the suit
challenging the New York laws to go to trial, Judge Richard Berman
cited U.S. Supreme Court cases that declared states' laws invalid
if their purpose was ``mere economic protectionism,'' which
opponents say is the fundamental purpose of the laws being
challenged.
</P>
<P>
   The wholesalers hotly deny this, claiming they are equally
concerned about the effects of the underage drinking that direct
shipping would surely encourage. ``The Constitution prevailed over
reckless disregard for temperance, tax collection and local
custom,'' said Duggan, the wholesalers' spokeswoman.
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. Senate is expected to consider a new direct shipping
bill, probably in the remaining weeks before the end of the current
session. Sponsored by Sen. Orrin Hatch, R-Utah, and called the 21st
Amendment Enforcement Act, the bill would, in essence, allow the
states to get federal help in prosecuting out-of-state wineries
that ship wine directly to a wine drinker.
</P>
<P>
   By itself, the bill probably would not get anywhere. Tacked onto
one appropriations bill or another, it will probably pass, but
direct shipping advocates say it will have minimal effect on the
growing number of suits in the federal courts aimed at overthrowing
the states' shipping laws.
</P>
<P>
   The whole fracas will almost certainly end up in the Supreme
Court, not because it's important that some dot-com plutocrat gets
his Pahlmeyer Chardonnay from Jason Pahlmeyer himself, but because
it affects the future of e-commerce and what many consider outmoded
interpretations of the 21st Amendment.
</P>
<P>
   Back in 1933, the idea behind the 21st was to keep gangsters out
of the liquor business. The thugs never did get out; they just went
legit, as Damon Runyon would say, and with the people who had been
locking them up on their side, they prospered.
</P>
<P>
   Now, for the first time, they face a serious threat. Not just
from a passel of wine geeks. The rise of the Internet has created a
new dynamic in the business world, one that a group of outmoded
monopolists, with a few prohibitionists along for old times' sake,
cannot long withstand. Besides, once the wineries agreed to pay
state taxes _ which they have _ it was all over but the shouting.
</P>
<P>
   It may take a while, but one day not too far off, clicking on
zinfandel and waiting for the Federal Express delivery will be an
essential part of the wine experience.

   NEW YORK _ Lobster, yes. Pork chops, no.
</P>
<P>
   Oysters, always. Bacon, never.
</P>
<P>
   As an assimilated Jew, this was the particular brand of culinary
schizophrenia I grew up with. At home, my family was kosher with a
vengeance. We had one set of dishes and silverware for meat,
another for dairy, and never the twain did meet. I remember hearing
that unkosher food was dirty, so pig remained reviled even when
served in restaurants, while shellfish (equally unkosher), had
somehow received a divine pardon. When the steamers hit the table
at the Clam Box you would have thought it was gefilte fish.
</P>
<P>
   But for truly observant Jews, the 24/7 variety, kosher
restaurants were traditionally the only alternative to staying home
or going to Grandma's. The atmosphere in these restaurants echoed
home _ large groups eating Old World classics like roast chicken
and potted meatballs at meat meccas like Gluckstern's or Lou G.
Siegel's. Or the same groups eating the cardiologist's special at
the dairy Ratner's: cheese blintzes fried in butter, topped with
sour cream.
</P>
<P>
   In recent years, though, those old-fashioned places have given
way to more modern kosher options, Chinese, Japanese, Indian,
Mexican and French steakhouses among them. These days, within a
half block of West 72nd Street alone you can find kosher pizza at
Pizza Cave and kosher ribs (albeit beef) at Dougie's Bar-B-Que &AMP;
Grill _ the only barbecue place I've ever seen that serves chicken
soup.
</P>
<P>
   But the newest additions to the kosher scene are high-end
restaurants featuring ambitious dishes like bison, rack of lamb and
whole roasted sea bass, with wine lists (hold the Manischewitz) in
elegant surroundings. As more and more affluent young people are
returning to the Orthodox tradition, they are demanding a new level
of sophistication to match the mainstream, with their own
cutting-edge choices. The latest entry in this category, Shallots,
has opened in the Sony Building on the former site of the Quilted
Giraffe, with prices to match its uptown digs: $47 for rack of
lamb. The Four Seasons, by comparison, charges $45. So much for
potted meatballs.
</P>
<P>
   ``Upscale kosher has exploded in the last five years,'' said Sol
Kirschenbaum, an owner of Levana, a contemporary Continental
restaurant on the Upper West Side that opened in 1986. The Zagat
Survey calls it ``the kosher Four Seasons,'' though it gives the
food a rating of 21 versus the Four Seasons' 26, and the average
meal at Levana is $44 instead of $67.
</P>
<P>
   ``Originally, people weren't used to kosher fine dining
establishments,'' Kirschenbaum said. ``Now they're no longer
satisfied with five places to go, they want 25. The choices have
become so broad.''
</P>
<P>
   ``You're dealing with a whole new set of demographics now,''
said Menachem Lubinsky, publisher of Kosher Today, a trade
publication, and the owner of Kosherfest, a kosher food trade show.
``Young Orthodox Jews are going upscale in every way, with cars,
homes and now restaurants. The cross-fertilization between the Joe
Liebermans of the world with Wall Street and the media means that
they need places to entertain them. The young Orthodox want
everything that the general population has, but they want it to be
kosher. At a typical wedding now, you're more likely to have sushi
than chopped liver.''
</P>
<P>
   That's too bad. I prefer chopped liver. Then again, being raised
in the school of Lobster Dinner Judaism means I have plenty of
choices when it comes to eating out. For those who don't, the brave
new world of nouvelle kosher offers not only Shallots, an offshoot
of a successful Chicago-based meat restaurant of the same name, but
two other entries: Il Patrizio, an Upper East Side Italian dairy
restaurant on the former site of Peaches, Marla Maples' place; and
Prime Grill, a steakhouse in Midtown that was most recently
Blackbird. Besides their culinary options, all three offer a lesson
in New York restaurant real estate: It pays to know your audience.
None of these locations made it with the mainstream (Shallots was
most recently Drew Nieporent's Berkeley Bar and Grill) though they
are in heavily trafficked areas.
</P>
<P>
   As Laura Frankel, the executive chef at Shallots, said, ``It's a
mistake these days to open a restaurant without a customer group in
mind.''
</P>
<P>
   Besides good food, that group wants ambience; the owners of
Prime Grill are spending close to $2 million for renovations by the
designer Matt Markowitz, who also did Jean-Georges Vongerichten's
Mercer Kitchen. The opening is scheduled for the end of October.
``We will serve steak and sushi, and by the way, we're kosher,''
said the manager, Chris Schienle. ``Instead of shrimp cocktail or a
raw bar, our customers can substitute sushi for shellfish.''
</P>
<P>
   For those wondering what ``by the way, we're kosher'' means,
kosher is not a cuisine. It is a strict adherence to dietary rules,
which, broadly defined, include a complete separation of milk and
meat, and a restriction to meat that comes from animals that have
split hooves, chew their cud and are slaughtered in accordance with
Jewish law; certain poultry, if it's killed correctly; and fish
that has fins and scales, which is why shellfish is a no-go.
</P>
<P>
   The good news these days, though, is that kosher suppliers have
broadened their inventory, benefiting from the general upgrading of
American restaurants _ though if my grandmother were here to see
Jews sitting down in fancy restaurants to eat buffalo, she would
surely call it meshuga. .
</P>
<P>
   The strides in dairy are a little less revolutionary. Il
Patrizio opened in May with a menu offering fish, pasta and
stone-oven pizza. Its chef, Cesar Moina, cooked at Mezzaluna and
Torre di Pisa, and on a recent visit, he made me, my sister,
Phoebe, and my aunt Evelyn very happy. Our favorite appetizer was a
combination of artichoke, potato, spinach and Parmesan, which was
the kind of thing you could eat a potful of on a cold night without
even realizing it.
</P>
<P>
   All three of us had fish, and it was nothing like the old days,
sitting on the plate in its own liquid, tasting like punishment.
The salmon with a mustard crust was crispy on the outside, tender
within; the whole roasted sea bass was moist and flavorful, and the
red snapper with olives, tomatoes and capers was downright festive.
</P>
<P>
   Il Patrizio's surroundings are simple and elegant, with exposed
brick walls and full-blown roses in glass bowls on white
tablecloths. The clientele was decidedly stylish, with one young
couple sporting shopping bags from Barneys and Stephane Kelian, and
a young guy (cute) eating alone at the bar. If the men weren't
wearing skullcaps, you'd have no idea the place was kosher, which,
in the lexicon of separate but equal, is the ultimate compliment.
</P>
<P>
   I brought my parents to Levana, where James Lenzi, the chef,
formerly of Tavern on the Green and Cafe des Artistes, stretches
the borders past brisket to venison, quail and bison. I especially
liked the pepper-crusted venison, which tasted like gourmet
pastrami. Lenzi also turns out beef fillets, veal chops and
sweetbreads, though the Israeli wine we ordered, Galil Merlot,
Carmel Private Collection, did none of them justice. The restaurant
is modern in design, a bit spare for my taste, but jammed with
everyone from young couples to large families, not to mention a
table of 10 women, one man and a blinding video camera. Most seemed
like satisfied regulars.

 (EDS: Accompanied by HOMEWORK-HELP)  (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
 By ALYSON WARD 
 c.2000 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   FORT WORTH, Texas _ A Fort Worth mother wakes her daughter
before sunrise each morning so she can practice piano before she
goes to school. It's an activity her daughter used to do in the
evenings _ but now that she's in the fifth grade, there's no time.
</P>
<P>
   Evenings are spent doing homework, often right up to bedtime,
and the 10-year-old's leisure and outside activities have been
eclipsed by math problems and worksheets, writing assignments and
science projects.
</P>
<P>
   ``Several times my little girl has been in tears because she
can't do it (all) without my help,'' says the mother, who asked not
to be identified. ``She's running out of time, it's 9 and she's got
to go to bed.''
</P>
<P>
   This mother believes homework is necessary, but it's
counterproductive when it starts to take over kids' lives. With
kids' activities and obligations, the time between school and
bedtime seems to be shrinking just as homework assignments are
expanding.
</P>
<P>
   Are they really expanding? A University of Michigan study
released last year indicates that kids are indeed spending more
time on homework than they used to. Between 1981 and 1997, the
study says, the mean length of time children ages 3-11 spent on
homework increased about 50 percent, to two hours, seven minutes
per week from one hour, 25 minutes.
</P>
<P>
   But Patty Yoxall of the National PTA, based in Chicago, says
that's not necessarily true for every student. In fact, she can't
find any obvious patterns or trends in student homework loads at
all _ reports vary from region to region, district to district,
school to school.
</P>
<P>
   ``We hear everything,'' she says. ``We hear, `My student has
four hours of homework every night and it's a burden' to `My
student doesn't have enough.'''
</P>
<P>
   In the Fort Worth area, reports seem to vary just as much, even
in the same district. But it's safe to say that many children (and
their parents) are frustrated, trying to fit homework time into a
hectic lifestyle.
</P>
<P>
   ``Kids are involved in so many out-of-school activities. By the
time they get home at night ... homework seems to be `what's left'
to do at night,'' says Elouise Perry, who teaches fifth grade at
Wimbish Elementary in Arlington. ``Homework is something parents
probably see as just one more thing to add to their schedules in
the evening.''
</P>
<P>
   It's especially difficult when both parents work and there's
more than one child doing homework.
</P>
<P>
   ``The big struggle is probably more for the parents _ coming
home at 5:30 or 6 and having to get dinner ready and do the
homework and get them in bed,'' says Catherine Puente of Fort
Worth.
</P>
<P>
   Puente and her husband have three children (two are school-age),
and both parents work full-time. Puente says she's a strong
believer in homework. Getting it done, though, is a matter of being
efficient and organized.
</P>
<P>
   Puente says she and her husband take turns working with each
daughter in the evenings. The Puentes' first-grader, Meredith,
spends more time on homework than her older sister.
</P>
<P>
   ``She has homework every day,'' Puente says. ``She brings home a
different book every evening that she has to read, and a spelling
list she has to learn two words from, each night.''
</P>
<P>
   Now Meredith has started dancing in the Ballet Folklorico, and
evening lessons and practices make time even more precious.
</P>
<P>
   So how much time should kids be spending on homework, anyway?
There's no clear answer. Teachers say the workload varies from
class to class and student to student _ and even day to day.
</P>
<P>
   About 10 years ago, the National Education Association and the
National PTA came up with rough guidelines for appropriate amounts
of homework. The group recommended 10 minutes of work per grade
level _ for instance, a first-grader should have about 10 minutes
of homework, a second-grader should have 20, and a sixth-grader
should have about an hour.
</P>
<P>
   Based on estimates given by several local parents and teachers,
many kids are spending substantially more time than this guideline
recommends.
</P>
<P>
   While some parents say their children's homework load is too
much, others are more radical and say any homework is too much.
</P>
<P>
   Etta Kralovec and John Buell question homework's value
altogether in a book published this year, ``The End of Homework:
How Homework Disrupts Families, Overburdens Children, and Limits
Learning'' (Beacon Press, $18). They say that children's main
``job'' is developing a social self, and it harms the maturing
process when students are forced too early into the ``work before
play'' mold of the adult workplace. In addition, Kralovec and Buell
say that homework stresses out kids and disrupts family life, and
that all work should be done at school _ not taken home and dragged
out through the evening.
</P>
<P>
   Along the same lines, a popular argument against homework is
that adults go to work, do their job and go home; for children,
``school'' is that job, and the work should end when the bell
rings.
</P>
<P>
   Jeff Bartolotta, who teaches fourth-, fifth- and sixth-graders
at Fort Worth's Como Montessori School, disagrees with this theory.
It's not valid, he says, because adults do take their work home.
Homework prepares kids for this responsibility in their careers.
</P>
<P>
   ``We need to get these kids socially ready for the world,''
Bartolotta says. ``If they learn early that they don't need to take
their job home, what's going to happen to them when they ``need''
to take their job home?''
</P>
<P>
   Learning that kind of responsibility takes time, though, and
many teachers are willing to compromise with students and their
parents in the meantime.
</P>
<P>
   Though Bartolotta assigns plenty of homework, he says he's aware
that his students' evening time might already be spoken for.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm very, very conscious of their extracurricular activities
after school,'' Bartolotta says. ``That's family time. I don't want
to take away from their family time.''
</P>
<P>
   Sarah Cooper, who teaches first grade at Fort Worth's A.M. Pate
Elementary, says she's also willing to compromise if homework is
becoming a burden.
</P>
<P>
   ``I kind of gauge (workload) on kid response and parent
response,'' Cooper says. ``If I hear parents saying, `That's too
much,' I pare it down a little.''
</P>
<P>
   But, she says: ``Usually I have parents say they've noticed
problems in a certain area, and they say, `Can you give us more to
do?' ''
</P>
<P>
   Teachers say this sort of parental concern is crucial _ it helps
them use homework to enhance a child's education. If parents are
involved in constructive communication with the teacher, they can
usually work with him or her to find homework assignments that meet
the child's needs.
</P>
<P>
   ``They really need to take an active role,'' Bartolotta says.
``They need to know what's going on in their child's classroom.''
</P>
<P>
   And this may be the bottom line on afterschool assignments: If
parents know what goes on in the classroom, they can fully
understand what needs to happen at home. Maybe parents should
consider that the real homework.

 NEW YORK: satisfied regulars.  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Far more formal is the two-month-old Shallots. There is only one
word to describe this restaurant, and that is chutzpah with a
capital C. Its style is corporate ornate, and perhaps a little
too-too for some of its customers. The man at the table next to
ours was shooed outside by his wife all three times his cell phone
rang. By the time dessert came, he looked as if he wished he were
back at Ratner's.
</P>
<P>
   Shallots drives the point home that you need more than kosher
food to make a kosher restaurant succeed; if you're going to play
in the big leagues, you need a top-of-the-line dining room staff.
While the service at Il Patrizio was unfailingly courteous, as it
was at Levana (if less polished), at Shallots it was case-study
bad. From the moment Phoebe and I walked in, we fought the urge to
leave. Granted, the sight of two women alone makes most
restaurateurs as happy as an unannounced visit by the health
inspector, but this was a new low. We were first led to a table
next to the restrooms, a service area and a table set for 18. When
we balked, we were relocated to the rear banquette; the
free-standing tables were reserved, we were told. Apparently, our
reservation didn't count.
</P>
<P>
   The chef, Frankel, is from Shallots Chicago and trained at the
Cooking Hospitality Institute of Chicago. Her $47 stuffed rack of
lamb seemed to indicate the scope of her ambitions, so Phoebe
ordered it and I ordered the grilled rib-eye, my favorite steak.
But here was an example of the new kosher gone wrong. While the
lamb was tasteless (forget the apricots, where's the salt?), the
rib-eye was downright unrecognizable. I called over a waiter, who
summoned a manager. ``What is this?'' I asked, genuinely confused.
``It's rib-eye,'' he explained. ``The chef orders it without the
bone and takes off the lip, which is the meat surrounding the eye.
That's the part with the fat in it, which is why there's no flavor.
Do you want something else?'' No. I wanted my steak with all the
fat in it so it tasted like steak _ the kind, actually, we used to
eat at Grossinger's.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, most of the other customers seemed suitably
impressed, though some remained skeptical. A man at one table _
where a laptop was up and running for most of the meal _ surveyed
the menu and asked loudly, ``What the hell is French melon
sorbet?,'' referring to an ingredient in the heirloom tomato salad.
</P>
<P>
   After two forgettable desserts, we got the check, which came to
$100 a person, about $20 more than it had been at Levana, $40 more
than at Il Patrizio, which, granted, had no meat. At Shallots, I
added a 15 percent tip without realizing that an 18 percent
gratuity had been added for me. I read it only after I'd left, in
the fine print at the bottom of the menu. Do I need to tell you
that no one pointed out my error?
</P>
<P>
   These glitches aside, however, kosher fine dining has clearly
made strides, and judging by the full dining rooms, it is
definitely satisfying its audience. But as much as I miss the onion
rolls at the old Ratner's, there is one thing I'm still certain of:
when it's time to eat out, I'll have the lobster. &QL;

A SMILE WARMED MARTHA WASHINGTON'S HEART 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Attn: N.H., Pa., Va., Britain)   (For release Sunday, Oct. 1)  
 By RITA REIF   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK_ On a Saturday in early October 1789, George Washington
powdered his graying brown hair, donned a yellow waistcoat, lace
cravat and the blue uniform with gold epaulettes that he had worn
as commander of the Continental Army and set off to meet John
Ramage, the most popular miniaturist in America. He probably went
to Ramage's studio on Williams Street in Lower Manhattan, 10 blocks
south of where he was staying on Cherry Street. There Ramage
painted his portrait, the first produced of Washington since he had
become president five months earlier. That night, he recorded the
event in his diary, writing, in his idiosyncratic way, ``Sat for
Mr. Ramage near two hours to-day who was drawing a miniature
Picture of me for Mrs. Washington.''
</P>
<P>
   The miniature, a half-length portrait in watercolor on ivory,
depicts Washington not as a man of power and authority but as
Martha Washington's husband of 30 years (she had also been married
previously). His thoughtful face, turned a bit to the right with
shadows accentuating the high brow and aristocratic nose, is
softened with a wisp of a smile, a Ramage trick. No doubt,
Washington knew how much Martha would treasure the intimate look of
the miniature, which he had Ramage, who was also a goldsmith, frame
in a 2[-inch elliptical gold locket edged with beading. On the
back, Ramage inscribed Washington's monogram on an oval of glass
covering a lock of hair said to be the president's.
</P>
<P>
   The locket has for most of the last two centuries remained in
the hands of two different families. A year or so after Washington
died, in 1799, Martha gave the locket to a niece, Betty Lewis
Carter, the daughter of his sister Betty, who had died before him.
In 1907, the locket was sold to Lucy Wharton Drexel, a member of
the Philadelphia family of bankers. In 1988, a descendant sent it
to Christie's in London. At a November auction that year, two
Americans _ Alexander Acevedo, a New York dealer, and Eddy G.
Nicholson, a New Hampshire investor and collector _ vied for the
locket by telephone from their homes in America at 5 o'clock in the
morning. The bidders, who knew each other well, were unaware that
they were competitors at the sale, until later.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was almost as stubborn as I was,'' said Acevedo, who bought
the locket for $623,000 _ 10 times the Christie's estimate _ a
price that remains the record for a miniature portrait.
</P>
<P>
   Two months later, Acevedo exhibited the miniature at his booth
at the Winter Antiques Show in Manhattan, and Nicholson, his first
customer, bought it for $650,000. Now he is selling it at
Christie's in New York on Jan. 19. It is expected to bring from
$600,000 to $900,000.
</P>
<P>
   ``Washington's loathing of sitting for his portrait is
well-documented, but this portrait is different because it is so
personal'' said Susan D. Kleckner, Christie's specialist in
American folk art and miniatures. So was the second image of
Washington that Ramage painted at the same sitting, a frontal view,
that is now in the collection of the Metropolitan Museum of Art.
(Ramage also made a copy of each; the second of the frontal
versions is in the Robert Hull Fleming Museum at the University of
Vermont; the whereabouts of the fourth miniature is unknown.)
</P>
<P>
   Miniatures painted by Ramage were prized for their brilliant
colors and long delicate brush strokes. The rich, layered surfaces
were livelier than those on the enameled images that were also
popular in the period. Ramage's portraits differ from many others
of Washington because they are more personal, less formal and each
has a trace of a smile on his face.
</P>
<P>
   The two versions that Ramage painted that day also differ in
more than the way the subject is posed. The differences are readily
apparent when the portraits are seen side by side. Recently,
Kleckner brought Martha's miniature to the Metropolitan Museum,
where it was placed alongside the museum version for comparison. In
Martha's slightly larger miniature, Washington seemed to be looking
into the distance, lost in thought. In the other version, he looks
equally intense, but his eyes are directly on the viewer, as if he
were about to speak.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike Martha's miniature, on which virtually every owner is
identified by engravings on the back of the locket, the museum's
work was of unknown provenance until 1924. It was then that the
last owner, Charles Allen Munn, a collector of Washington paintings
who was the publisher of the Scientific American, bequeathed it to
the museum.
</P>
<P>
   What is less well known to the public today is Martha
Washington's feelings about miniatures and lockets. She cherished
these pictures and had many painted of her children from her first
marriage, and she often enclosed locks of their hair as expressions
of intimacy. To many mourners who sent her letters of condolences
after Washington's death, she sent locks of his hair.
</P>
<P>
   What was the significance of the hair? ``Hair was precious,
intimate and incredibly meaningful,'' said Carrie Barrattc, a
curator of American Paintings and Sculpture at the museum who is an
expert on miniatures. ``We forget today _ when most everyone's hair
is so visible, and hair is being swept into dust bins in beauty
parlors everywhere _ that in the 18th century you rarely saw
people's hair. They wore hats, veils and kerchiefs; they powdered
their hair or wore wigs. Hair helped to commemorate a person. In a
locket it made a portrait into a token of affection rather than a
record of a likeness. These are secular reliquaries, watercolor on
ivory _ bone _ and occasionally, hair at the back.''

 &HT;    SENATE LOGJAM IMPERILS RETIREMENT SAVINGS BILL
 &HT;    750&AMP;add.
 &HT;    By ANDREW MOLLISON
 &HT;    c.2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ You'll be able to put a lot more money into a
tax-protected IRA or 401(k) retirement savings account _ if the
Senate can get its act together in the next few weeks.
</P>
<P>
   The popular pension bill is one of the few small measures to
survive this year's battle over major tax cuts between President
Clinton and Congress. But it remains stalled in a legislative
traffic jam in the Senate.
</P>
<P>
   ``At this point, it's just a question of getting agreement on
what vehicle (piece of legislation) that will be attached to in
this session,'' Senate Majority Leader Trent Lott, R-Miss., said
Tuesday. But he said he didn't know when that will happen.
</P>
<P>
   The House has voted twice for a bipartisan plan crafted by Reps.
Rob Portman, R-Ohio, and Ben Cardin, D-Md.
</P>
<P>
   The Clinton administration had some minor objections, but didn't
issue a veto threat. In any case, the measure passed by veto-proof
margins of 401-25 in July and 401-20 last week.
</P>
<P>
   Over the next five years, it would:
</P>
<P>
   _ Raise the $2,000 annual limit on Individual Retirement Account
(IRA) contributions to $5,000 for someone under 50, and $10,000 for
someone 50 or older. The new limits would apply both to a regular
IRA, in which contributions are tax-free but withdrawals are
taxable, and to a Roth IRA, where contributions are taxable but
withdrawals are tax-free.
</P>
<P>
   _ Raise the $10,500 annual limit on contributions to a regular
401(k) plan to $15,000 for those under 50, and $20,000 for those 50
or older. In addition, companies for the first time could offer
their employees a Roth 401(k) plan, which would have the same
higher limits.
</P>
<P>
   _ Make technical changes supported by most groups of employees
or employers. The changes would simplify and clarify federal
pension laws, raise the income ceilings for all tax-favored
retirement savings and pension plans, tie future IRA and 401(k)
contribution limits to inflation and increase the portability of
pension benefits for job-hoppers.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's bipartisan and thoroughly vetted, and I hope we can dig
it out of the political back-and-forth,'' Portman said. ``This is
urgently needed, because about half the work force lacks any
pension coverage at all, and in small businesses the percentage
covered by pension plans is below 20 percent.''
</P>
<P>
   The bill's primary beneficiaries would be people who are well
off _ the 2 percent of taxpayers who already give the $2,000
maximum to their IRAs, and the 6 percent of 401(k) plan users who
already give the $10,500 maximum. Older people who didn't save much
when they were young would also benefit.
</P>
<P>
   Depending on how many savers take advantage of the opportunity,
the Treasury would lose between $42 billion and $100 billion in
revenue over the next 10 years.
</P>
<P>
   On the other hand, the economy would benefit if personal savings
increase. Moreover, the extra fees and commissions from savers who
increased their retirement savings or switched from taxable to
tax-protected investments would help the securities industry,
giving it new revenue far in excess of the $25 million a year that
it contributes to the major parties.
</P>
<P>
   This month, the Senate Finance Committee approved a modified
retirement savings bill drafted by its chairman, Sen. William Roth,
R-Del.
</P>
<P>
   Roth included similar IRA and 401(k) provisions and added a
non-controversial proposal to require that companies switching
pension plans disclose to the workers whether their benefits would
be bigger under the old plan or the new plan.
</P>
<P>
   But two of Roth's other changes could make it harder to obtain
bipartisan agreement without a Senate floor fight.
</P>
<P>
   Conservatives criticized a provision offering tax credits that
would match part of the retirement savings of some low-income and
middle-income taxpayers. Those eligible would include about 24
percent of families, those with adjusted gross incomes below
$10,000 per adult, according to calculations by Professor Jeffrey
Liebman of Harvard University.
</P>
<P>
   Roth's other change enraged the employee-directed Pension Rights
Center and the AARP, an advocacy group for people 50 or older. It
would protect companies from age-discrimination suits when they
switch from old-fashioned ``defined contribution'' pension plans
(which reward seniority and early retirement) to new ``cash
balance'' pension plans (which discourage early retirement and
reward younger workers who job-hop).
</P>
<P>
   (Story can end here. Optional add follows)
</P>
<P>
   ``This is the wrong way to go,'' said policy analyst David
Certner of the AARP. ``There are more than 500 complaints pending
(at the Equal Employment Opportunities Commission) about age
discrimination filed by older workers who say their benefits were
reduced by these pension-plan switches.''
</P>
<P>
   Kathleen Havey(cq), director of pension policy at the U.S.
Chamber of Commerce, said the national business group ``strongly
supports'' Roth's approach.
</P>
<P>
   ``We feel that early retirement subsidies were put in place in a
different era, when employers made an effort to avoid layoffs by
encouraging employees to retire,'' Havey said. ``Now a lot of our
members have hundreds of jobs they can't fill, and they don't want
to offer a bonus for some of their best and brightest employees to
walk out the door early.''
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Tom Harkin, D-Iowa, who is preparing an amendment that
would gut the plan-switching provision, said, ``Instead of
providing additional protection from age discrimination, this
proposal appears to allow some employers to disregard existing
legal employee protections.''
</P>
<P>
   However, a spokeswoman for Sen. Charles Grassley, R-Iowa, who
wrote the law that prohibits age discrimination in pension plans,
said Grassley believes Roth's proposal is ``a huge improvement over
current law.''
</P>
<P>
   Asked Tuesday about his bill's chances, Roth said, ``That's
going to become law. Well, I hope it will.''

10 WAYS TO MAKE HOMEWORK TIME PRODUCTIVE TIME
</HEADLINE>
 
 (EDS: Accompanies HOMEWORK-STRATEGIES)  (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
 c.2000 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Getting involved is the most important thing you can do to help
your kids with homework. An interested and active parent can help a
child learn, make sure the assignments are completed, and talk to
the teacher if problems develop.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, this doesn't mean making your child's homework your
own. Or strong-arming teachers into what you may think is best.
</P>
<P>
   Teachers and education experts offer these tips for parents who
want to help make homework time a good thing.
</P>
<P>
   _
</P>
<P>
   1. Establish a routine: It's important to set aside a certain
time for doing homework each night. That way, it's more difficult
to push it aside.
</P>
<P>
   Sarah Cooper, a first-grade teacher at Pate Elementary, can
vouch for routine as a parent: ``My son works at the kitchen table
while I'm doing the cooking,'' she says. ``By the time I finish
dinner, he's usually finished with his homework.''
</P>
<P>
   He can relax a little bit after school _ but once she starts
dinner, Cooper says, he knows it's homework time, and he gets
started.
</P>
<P>
   _
</P>
<P>
   2. Establish a location: Provide a good place for studying _ a
quiet, well-lit desk or table. Designating a specific area makes it
easier to stay focused. Turn off the TV.
</P>
<P>
   ``If they're doing (homework) in front of the TV, they can spend
three hours in front of the TV and still not have studied for a
test,'' says Joe Ferrara, who teaches seventh- and eighth-graders
at Fort Worth's Riverside Middle School. ``Try to keep that area
consistent.''
</P>
<P>
   _
</P>
<P>
   3. Establish communication: Get to know your child's teacher.
Express concerns. Teachers want you to talk to them. Your teacher
will help you figure out if your child is truly overchallenged by
the work, or just resistant to doing it.
</P>
<P>
   ``I feel like some parents are scared to come,'' says Como
Montessori School teacher Jeff Bartolotta. ``It's such a help. It
makes our job so much easier when parents come and say what they
need to say.''
</P>
<P>
   But don't be confrontational _ the teacher probably wants to
help your child just as much as you do.
</P>
<P>
   _
</P>
<P>
   4. Pay attention: Know what your child is learning. Sit with
her, let her read to you, ask her questions. But don't do her
homework for her _ her teacher needs to see where she's having
trouble.
</P>
<P>
   ``I remember when I was a kid, I did my homework with my
parents,'' Bartolotta says. ``They were helping me and I was
teaching them. Now, I don't believe that happens as much.''
</P>
<P>
   It helps to check your child's homework after it's completed _
as long as your ``child'' is the one making the corrections.
</P>
<P>
   _
</P>
<P>
   5. Offer guidance: Figure out your child's learning style, and
help him find the way he learns best. Talk to him about what he's
learning, and make sure he understands lessons and assignments.
</P>
<P>
   This might mean you have to do a little prodding _ ``A lot of
times, students don't always tell parents they have homework,''
Perry says. Be aware of the assignment and do what you can to help.
</P>
<P>
   _
</P>
<P>
   6. Do some troubleshooting: If your child's having trouble, find
out what is troubling her, says Patty Yoxall with the National PTA.
Pinpoint the problem and work on it together _ and go to the
teacher if it's something you can't fix.
</P>
<P>
   Many problems can be solved, though, with a little parental
guidance. If disorganization is the problem, get your child a
calendar or assignment book and help her learn to use it. If time
management is a struggle, take charge, and gradually teach your
child to budget time on her own.
</P>
<P>
   _
</P>
<P>
   7. Make it bearable: If the assignment is overwhelming, break it
up into parts for your child.
</P>
<P>
   If it's a stack of worksheets due the next day, your child might
do part of the work immediately after school, then take a break and
finish it later. If it's a spelling test on Friday, don't let your
child try to memorize all the words Thursday night. Start on
Monday; have her write the words for a couple of days, then start
quizzing her midweek.
</P>
<P>
   _
</P>
<P>
   8. Do the hardest part _ the dreaded part of the assignment _
first. Get it over with and ``the rest is pure pleasure,'' Yoxall
says.
</P>
<P>
   _
</P>
<P>
   9. Introduce the shocking idea that homework can be enjoyable.
``Make it an exercise in learning as opposed to a drill that's
going to be graded,'' Yoxall suggests. Your attitude will influence
your child's attitude; help them realize the work is important, she
says, ``not just a grind that's keeping them off the softball
field.'' Play Hangman with spelling words; make word searches and
other games to help with exercises aimed at memorization.
</P>
<P>
   _
</P>
<P>
   10. Be realistic about time: Your child might be involved in too
many activities. If he is sleep-deprived and never seems to have
any downtime, re-evaluate his activities schedule. But don't be
rash: Don't automatically decree that your child has to drop band
or leave the soccer team he loves _ involvement is good for kids,
too. Yoxall suggests talking to your child's teacher before
dropping any activities.

<P>
   Decrease homework hassles with tried-and-true incentives
</P>
<P>
   If your child is dawdling over his spelling list, ``forgetting''
science projects and arguing about the importance of long division,
maybe he just needs a little incentive. You, concerned parent, can
help.
</P>
<P>
   Child discipline expert Dr. Sal Severe, author of ``How To
Behave So Your Children Will, Too,'' (Viking Press, $23.95), offers
some suggestions in his book. Try these tactics to motivate your
child:
</P>
<P>
   Make a checklist or a chart your child can fill out. Make a list
of the necessary steps for completing homework (''write down
assignments,'' ``start on time,'' ``check your work,'' etc.) and
offer daily, weekly or long-term rewards. This instills good habits
and helps your child know what is expected.
</P>
<P>
   Computers and educational software can make work much more
appealing. Try some educational software programs, a CD-ROM
encyclopedia or an online research service. They're effective and
their novelty can make work more interesting. Our editors' picks:
Titles by The Learning Company, including the Reader Rabbit series
(good for beginning readers).

<P>
   Don't use punishment as a motivator. Punishment doesn't work
that way, Severe says _ you can't make your child learn by
punishing, and arguments over homework only give kids another
button to push. Instead, encourage your child. Instead of fighting
over homework, be positive and help your child develop
self-discipline.

 FROM: THE HARVARD MANAGEMENT COMMUNICATION LETTER  
 By STEVE ROBBINS  
 c.2000 Harvard Business School Publishing  
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
<TEXT>
<P>
   How can management communications be screwed up? Let us count
the ways.
</P>
<P>
   Some can be traced to the idiosyncrasies of leaders _ for
example, Howard Hughes, who had a deathly fear of germs,
communicated with employees solely by notes or by telephone.
</P>
<P>
   But then there are the common foul-ups that every company falls
prey to at one time or another. Here are eight typical blunders and
how to avoid them.
</P>
<P>
   COMMUNICATION WITHOUT GROUND WORK
</P>
<P>
   Any controversial decision can engender scheming, plots and
politics. So rather than announcing a controversial decision to an
entire group, prep people one-on-one. By doing so, you can build an
alliance around the process, even if people disagree about the
content.
</P>
<P>
   Topics involving change are the most charged _ especially
reorganizations, changing goals and the departure of key employees.
</P>
<P>
   One way to cope is to name the emotion. ``This reorganization is
scary.'' Then address the concerns. Share the scenario you expect
to unfold. Demonstrate with your voice and body that you get it.
</P>
<P>
   LYING
</P>
<P>
   Certain topics must remain confidential while they're under
discussion. But be careful how you keep secrets. If people know
you've lied, you will lose their trust forever.
</P>
<P>
   Rather than lie, train yourself to respond, ``No comment'' or
``I can't answer that fully right now'' when asked about sticky
topics. Consistency is important. Warren Buffet never discusses his
investments, even with shareholders. As a result, his silence on a
particular deal gives away nothing.
</P>
<P>
   BELIEVING THAT WORDS CAN OVERCOME ACTIONS
</P>
<P>
   We want to believe that logic and discussion are the stuff of
persuasion, but in the end, actions win every time. If you say you
value everyone equally, but the executives have special parking
privileges, the message is clear: Status and title matter. If you
say you want feedback but explode when the feedback is negative,
the message is clear: You want to hear only about the good stuff.
</P>
<P>
   Before communicating standards of behavior, values or goals,
look carefully in the mirror. Review your recent decisions, and ask
whether the decisions support the values you're espousing. If not,
change your behavior.
</P>
<P>
   IGNORING THE REALITIES OF POWER
</P>
<P>
   Surprised that you never hear bad news until it's too late?
Don't be. The more power you have, the less you'll hear problems.
</P>
<P>
   For an honest assessment of a problem, seek out bad news. And
when it comes, appreciate it (visibly!).
</P>
<P>
   However, messages are magnified as they travel down the
hierarchy. For example, if you look pained during a presentation,
everyone will ``know'' you hated the presentation (or worse _ the
presenter).
</P>
<P>
   To prevent rumors, use plain, simple language. End meetings by
reviewing your reactions and next steps. ``I enjoyed your analysis,
Chris. The sales trend is disturbing _ let's follow up on
Wednesday.''
</P>
<P>
   MIXING BUSINESS AND FRIENDSHIP COMMUNICATION
</P>
<P>
   Confine friendship and business interactions to separate
meetings. If you must mix them, make the boundary clear. ``Let's
stop talking business for a minute and just talk as friends.''
</P>
<P>
   When it comes to contentious topics, keep it 100 percent
business in the office. An executive remarked to a friend at a
trade show that a new hire was extremely capable _ and good-looking
too. Bad move. Such comments at work can hurt credibility or turn
into a discrimination lawsuit.
</P>
<P>
   UNDERESTIMATING YOUR AUDIENCE'S INTELLIGENCE
</P>
<P>
   It's tempting to gloss over issues because ``people won't
understand.'' Why explain a reorganization when you can simply say,
``Here's the new org chart''?
</P>
<P>
   But that's a cop-out. Frontline employees may not be masters of
organizational design, but they deserve to know the rationale
behind changes that affect their lives. It's your job to help them
understand.
</P>
<P>
   CONFUSING PROCESS WITH OUTCOME
</P>
<P>
   In goal-setting, compensation and evaluation, it's easy to
confuse process with outcome. For example, you promise your team a
10 percent raise, but then the board caps raises at 5 percent. You
fight to raise the number, and compromise on 7 percent. But your
people don't appreciate it.
</P>
<P>
   You want your team to honor how hard you tried _ to love you for
your process, not for your outcomes.
</P>
<P>
   When setting goals or evaluation criteria, communicate and
measure both the outcomes and processes involved. Motivation comes
from setting ambitious goals, especially if people are free to
choose how to reach them. To build a strong organization, however,
evaluation should include effort, learning and improvement _ all
process measurements _ to reinforce effective behavior.
</P>
<P>
   USING INAPPROPRIATE FORMS OF COMMUNICATION
</P>
<P>
   Different communication channels work best for different topics.
</P>
<P>
   E-mail is great for conveying information, but don't use it for
emotional issues; e-mail messages are too easy to misconstrue.
</P>
<P>
   Phone calls and face-to-face meetings are inefficient media for
disseminating information, but great for discussing emotional
topics. You can handle the listener's reaction, and you can use
your tone of voice and facial expressions to control your message.
</P>

 FROM: HARVARD MANAGEMENT UPDATE  
 c.2000 Harvard Business School Publishing  
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
<TEXT>
<P>
   When Multi-Health Systems (MHS) of Toronto, Ontario, tested
1,500 U.S. Air Force recruiters for emotional intelligence, it
identified five attributes that separated those who made 100
percent of their quotas from those who made 70 percent or below.
MHS assigned relative weights to the attributes and they became the
basis for a formula for hiring new recruiters.
</P>
<P>
   Among the 250 to 300 people the Air Force hired using this
formula, the retention rate shot up by 92 percent. Factoring in the
costs of hiring, training and settling a new recruit into a
position, this translated into a $2.7 million savings.
</P>
<P>
   Nobody questions the importance of emotional intelligence for
leadership. Indeed, studies indicate that your emotional
intelligence or emotional quotient (EQ) accounts for 15 percent to
45 percent of your success on the job. (Your IQ, by comparison, is
said to account for less than 6 percent.)
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, notes author Daniel Goleman, in a 1996 study of a
global food and beverage company, where senior managers had a
critical mass of emotional intelligence, their divisions
outperformed yearly earnings goals by 20 percent. Division leaders
without that critical mass underperformed by almost the same
amount.
</P>
<P>
   In the past, however, it's been difficult to apply the
principles of emotional intelligence to everyday situations. But
now that's changing. MHS and other companies have developed
assessment tools that can be incorporated into hiring,
performance-appraisal and executive-development processes. And
results like those achieved by the Air Force are making companies
take notice _ especially in the current climate, in which
competitive strategy depends upon the ability to hire and retain
top-notch workers.
</P>
<P>
   ``For us, it was a matter of getting a better understanding of
all the people we were bringing in,'' says Shelley Ross, human
resources specialist at Wrigley Canada in Toronto. ``As with most
companies, our corporate culture has changed over the course of the
'90s. We now need people who are more flexible, more committed to
satisfying the customer. We've also moved to more of a team-based
approach throughout our plants, so we need people with better
decision-making skills.''
</P>
<P>
   Wrigley Canada started using MHS's emotional intelligence test
on all prospective hires in 1998. Previously, the company had used
a personality assessment for professional and supervisory positions
only.
</P>
<P>
   In both examples, the MHS test used is called the EQ-i,
developed by psychologist Reuven Bar-On.
</P>
<P>
   A self-report instrument, the EQ-i rates respondents' answers
using five composite scales: intrapersonal, interpersonal,
adaptability, stress management and general mood. These five scales
are broken down into 15 subscale scores. Each test costs $30 to $35
and takes about 40 minutes to complete.
</P>
<P>
   How useful is the EQ-i? Wrigley's results have shown the
instrument to be ``an accurate tool,'' Ross concludes.
</P>
<P>
   Typically, the test is administered after an initial interview
with the hiring manager and a representative from HR. The results
can point to aspects of the candidate's social or self-management
skills that bear further investigation.
</P>
<P>
   ``Later in the process,'' Ross says, ``the hiring manager and
team members can use the test results to fine-tune their questions
of the candidate. I find that the test helps me with reference
checking in a similar way.''
</P>
<P>
   ``A person should never be hired based on test results alone,''
cautions MHS president and CEO Steven Stein. Prior experience,
education, references, interviews and even sample assignments
should all be factored into the decision.
</P>
<P>
   But that said, how can you implement the principles of emotional
intelligence in your own company's hiring processes? The route MHS
took with the Air Force is the most thorough, but if you have
constraints, start by administering an emotional intelligence test
to all job candidates. Then use tables MHS has developed _ they
list the most important EQ components for a variety of job
classifications _ to identify the best applicants.
</P>
<P>
   If an emotional intelligence test seems too involved, says
Sandra Yingling, Ph.D., senior consultant at Hay Group in Walnut
Creek, Calif., ``you can conduct `behavioral-event interviewing'
instead.
</P>
<P>
   ``For example, you ask a candidate to describe a time when she
felt frustrated by someone who didn't understand her idea. In the
candidate's response, you listen for how she decoded the reactions
of the other people around the table at the time of the
misunderstanding. At Hay, we've developed a dictionary of emotional
competencies that we use to assess the level of emotional
sophistication in a candidate's descriptions.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The whole idea of recruiting is to get someone who fits the
job and the culture,'' Wrigley's Ross says. ``We've discovered that
it's worth the effort to find someone who's a better match.''
</P>
<P>
   And EQ is becoming an increasingly important tool for that
search.

 FROM: THE HARVARD MANAGEMENT COMMUNICATION LETTER  
 By STEVE ROBBINS  
 c.2000 Harvard Business School Publishing  
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
<TEXT>
<P>
   How can management communications be screwed up? Let us count
the ways.
</P>
<P>
   Some can be traced to the idiosyncrasies of leaders _ for
example, Howard Hughes, who had a deathly fear of germs,
communicated with employees solely by notes or by telephone.
</P>
<P>
   But then there are the common foul-ups that every company falls
prey to at one time or another. Here are eight typical blunders and
how to avoid them.
</P>
<P>
   COMMUNICATION WITHOUT GROUND WORK
</P>
<P>
   Any controversial decision can engender scheming, plots and
politics. So rather than announcing a controversial decision to an
entire group, prep people one-on-one. By doing so, you can build an
alliance around the process, even if people disagree about the
content.
</P>
<P>
   Topics involving change are the most charged _ especially
reorganizations, changing goals and the departure of key employees.
</P>
<P>
   One way to cope is to name the emotion. ``This reorganization is
scary.'' Then address the concerns. Share the scenario you expect
to unfold. Demonstrate with your voice and body that you get it.
</P>
<P>
   LYING
</P>
<P>
   Certain topics must remain confidential while they're under
discussion. But be careful how you keep secrets. If people know
you've lied, you will lose their trust forever.
</P>
<P>
   Rather than lie, train yourself to respond, ``No comment'' or
``I can't answer that fully right now'' when asked about sticky
topics. Consistency is important. Warren Buffet never discusses his
investments, even with shareholders. As a result, his silence on a
particular deal gives away nothing.
</P>
<P>
   BELIEVING THAT WORDS CAN OVERCOME ACTIONS
</P>
<P>
   We want to believe that logic and discussion are the stuff of
persuasion, but in the end, actions win every time. If you say you
value everyone equally, but the executives have special parking
privileges, the message is clear: Status and title matter. If you
say you want feedback but explode when the feedback is negative,
the message is clear: You want to hear only about the good stuff.
</P>
<P>
   Before communicating standards of behavior, values or goals,
look carefully in the mirror. Review your recent decisions, and ask
whether the decisions support the values you're espousing. If not,
change your behavior.
</P>
<P>
   IGNORING THE REALITIES OF POWER
</P>
<P>
   Surprised that you never hear bad news until it's too late?
Don't be. The more power you have, the less you'll hear problems.
</P>
<P>
   For an honest assessment of a problem, seek out bad news. And
when it comes, appreciate it (visibly!).
</P>
<P>
   However, messages are magnified as they travel down the
hierarchy. For example, if you look pained during a presentation,
everyone will ``know'' you hated the presentation (or worse _ the
presenter).
</P>
<P>
   To prevent rumors, use plain, simple language. End meetings by
reviewing your reactions and next steps. ``I enjoyed your analysis,
Chris. The sales trend is disturbing _ let's follow up on
Wednesday.''
</P>
<P>
   MIXING BUSINESS AND FRIENDSHIP COMMUNICATION
</P>
<P>
   Confine friendship and business interactions to separate
meetings. If you must mix them, make the boundary clear. ``Let's
stop talking business for a minute and just talk as friends.''
</P>
<P>
   When it comes to contentious topics, keep it 100 percent
business in the office. An executive remarked to a friend at a
trade show that a new hire was extremely capable _ and good-looking
too. Bad move. Such comments at work can hurt credibility or turn
into a discrimination lawsuit.
</P>
<P>
   UNDERESTIMATING YOUR AUDIENCE'S INTELLIGENCE
</P>
<P>
   It's tempting to gloss over issues because ``people won't
understand.'' Why explain a reorganization when you can simply say,
``Here's the new org chart''?
</P>
<P>
   But that's a cop-out. Frontline employees may not be masters of
organizational design, but they deserve to know the rationale
behind changes that affect their lives. It's your job to help them
understand.
</P>
<P>
   CONFUSING PROCESS WITH OUTCOME
</P>
<P>
   In goal-setting, compensation and evaluation, it's easy to
confuse process with outcome. For example, you promise your team a
10 percent raise, but then the board caps raises at 5 percent. You
fight to raise the number, and compromise on 7 percent. But your
people don't appreciate it.
</P>
<P>
   You want your team to honor how hard you tried _ to love you for
your process, not for your outcomes.
</P>
<P>
   When setting goals or evaluation criteria, communicate and
measure both the outcomes and processes involved. Motivation comes
from setting ambitious goals, especially if people are free to
choose how to reach them. To build a strong organization, however,
evaluation should include effort, learning and improvement _ all
process measurements _ to reinforce effective behavior.
</P>
<P>
   USING INAPPROPRIATE FORMS OF COMMUNICATION
</P>
<P>
   Different communication channels work best for different topics.
</P>
<P>
   E-mail is great for conveying information, but don't use it for
emotional issues; e-mail messages are too easy to misconstrue.
</P>
<P>
   Phone calls and face-to-face meetings are inefficient media for
disseminating information, but great for discussing emotional
topics. You can handle the listener's reaction, and you can use
your tone of voice and facial expressions to control your message.
</P>

&HT;     ABORTION RIGHTS GROUP WANTS PRO-CHOICE REPUBLICANS TO SUPPORT
GORE 
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 &HT;     By JENNIFER A. DLOUHY  
 &HT;     c.2000 Hearst Newspapers  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ A national abortion rights organization announced
Tuesday that it is launching a $5-million, 15-state campaign to
persuade pro-choice independent and Republican voters to support
Democrat Al Gore.
</P>
<P>
   The National Abortion and Reproductive Rights Action League
(NARAL) will target two million voters who favor abortion rights.
NARAL President Kate Michelman said the organization will use
direct mail, Internet advertising and phone calls ``to mobilize the
pro-choice vote.''
</P>
<P>
   ``This election will be won on the ground, voter by voter,
neighborhood by neighborhood district by district from
congressional races all the way up to the presidency,'' Michelman
told a news conference.
</P>
<P>
   NARAL also released its list of House candidates who the group
believes are unlikely to support abortion rights. In those
districts, NARAL will lobby for the pro-choice alternatives,
Michelman said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Defeating these candidates will enable us to pick up key seats
in the House, returning leadership to the hands of House members
committed to protecting a woman's right to choose,'' Michelman
said.
</P>
<P>
   Texas Gov. George W. Bush, the Republican presidential nominee,
is at the top of the NARAL's ``worst choice list.''
</P>
<P>
   Targeted Republican or independent voters will be contacted
between four and seven times before the Nov. 7 election, Michelman
said.
</P>
<P>
   She said NARAL is targeting voters in California, Florida, Iowa,
Michigan, Missouri, Minnesota, Montana, New Hampshire, New Mexico,
Ohio, Pennsylvania, New Jersey, New York, Washington and Wisconsin.
</P>
<P>
   Michelman said NARAL has compiled its list of pro-choice
Republican or independent voters from previous get-out-the vote
drives and from records of campaign contributors.
</P>
<P>
   NARAL joins Emily's List, another abortion rights advocacy
organization, in seeking support of undecided women voters to elect
pro-choice Democratic women to Congress.
</P>
<P>
   Women hold unprecedented power as a voting bloc, said Ellen
Malcolm, president of Emily's List, a political action committee.
</P>
<P>
   ``Women are going to determine the outcome of this election,''
Malcolm said. ``Women make up the vast majority of the undecided
electorate.''
</P>
<P>
   According to an Emily's List-sponsored poll earlier this month,
12 percent of registered women voters were unsure who they would
vote for president, compared to 6 percent of male voters.
</P>
<P>
   In congressional races, 24 percent of women were undecided,
compared to 17 percent of men. The survey of 1,267 voters had a
margin of error of plus or minus 2.9 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Emily's List is working to mobilize female voters likely to
support women and Democratic candidates with a $10 million
campaign. In 1998, the organization sent nearly 8 million pieces of
mail and made over two million telephone calls to 3.4 million women
in 26 states as part of its get-out-the-vote initiative. In 1998,
members of the organization contributed $7.5 million to Democratic
women candidates.

 &HT;    Canned pumpkin fills the bill for many busy hometown cooks
 &HT;    By Ann Heller
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   DAYTON, Ohio - My mother always made pumpkin pie from scratch,
using the little pumpkins my father grew. She did it even when she
made 20 pies for the church circle meeting.
</P>
<P>
   With apologies to Mom, I'll admit I keep a couple of cans of
pumpkin puree on the shelf.
</P>
<P>
   I use it for my Thanksgiving pie (my excuse is that most of the
pumpkins are gone by then). And canned pumpkin is good for a quick
pumpkin bread.
</P>
<P>
   Now everyone has a recipe for pumpkin bread, that cheap, quick
bread that's a fall staple. I call this one Not Your Mother's
Pumpkin Bread. It's adult bread that includes sherry. It is not as
sweet, and the spicing is more delicate.
</P>
<P>
   And nut oil, either walnut or hazelnut, adds heady flavor. Yes,
that oil is expensive but this is a quick bread to serve with tea
or sherry rather than feed the troops. You can use cheap sunflower
oil, but the aroma and taste will be more neutral.
</P>
<P>
   I added nuts for more texture. Use walnuts with walnut oil,
hazelnuts with hazelnut oil.
</P>
<P>
   This is a big recipe, and the batter will nearly fill your
largest mixing bowl. Expect some splatters while you mix.
</P>
<P>
   NOT YOUR MOTHER'S PUMPKIN BREAD
</P>
<P>
   Makes 3 loaves
</P>
<P>
   2 cups sugar
</P>
<P>
   1 1/4 cups light brown sugar
</P>
<P>
   1 26-ounce can pumpkin
</P>
<P>
   4 eggs
</P>
<P>
   1 cup walnut or hazelnut oil
</P>
<P>
   4 2/3 cups unbleached all purpose flour
</P>
<P>
   1 tablespoon baking soda
</P>
<P>
   1 1/2 teaspoons each ground cinnamon, cloves and coriander
</P>
<P>
   1 teaspoon salt
</P>
<P>
   1/2 cup cream sherry
</P>
<P>
   1 1/2 cups walnuts or hazelnuts
</P>
<P>
   Preheat oven to 350 degrees.
</P>
<P>
   Grease three 8-by-4-inch loaf pans.
</P>
<P>
   In a large bowl combine the sugars, pumpkin, eggs and nut oil.
Beat with an electric mixer one minute.
</P>
<P>
   In another bowl combine the flour, baking soda, spices and salt.
</P>
<P>
   With a large spatula combine the wet and dry mixtures and beat
until smooth. Stir in the cream sherry. Beat with an electric mixer
until thoroughly blended, 1 to 2 minutes. Mix in nuts.
</P>
<P>
   Scrape the batter into the loaf pans, filling each no more than
3/4 full.
</P>
<P>
   Bake immediately in the center of the preheated oven for 65 to
75 minutes, until a cake tester inserted into each center comes out
clean. Let stand 5 minutes in the pans before turning out onto a
rack to cool completely.
</P>
<P>
   Wrap tightly in plastic wrap and let set at room temperature
overnight. The loaves can be kept at room temperature for as long
as 4 days, or frozen.

</P>
<P>
   When it comes to convenience, canned pumpkin isn't my only
culinary sin. Although it's true you can save the pumpkin seeds
from a pumpkin, cleaning them is just too much trouble for the
rewards. I'd rather buy green pumpkin seeds (found with bulk nuts
in some stores) and take just a few minutes to fix this addictive
appetizer.
</P>
<P>
   SPICY PUMPKIN SEEDS
</P>
<P>
   Makes 2 cups
</P>
<P>
   2 tablespoons olive oil
</P>
<P>
   4 cloves garlic, halved
</P>
<P>
   1/2 pound hulled green pumpkin seeds
</P>
<P>
   1/4 to 1/2 teaspoon cayenne
</P>
<P>
   1/4 teaspoon salt
</P>
<P>
   Place the oil and garlic, cut side down, in an 8-inch skillet.
Heat, lightly browning the garlic. Remove garlic from the oil.
</P>
<P>
   Add the pumpkin seeds to the skillet and stir to coat well with
the oil. Sprinkle the cayenne over the seeds and stir to mix. Cook,
stirring frequently, until the pumpkin seeds have popped and begun
to turn brown, about 8 minutes.
</P>
<P>
   Drain the seeds on paper towels, then place in a medium bowl.
Sprinkle with salt. These can be made as long as a week ahead.
</P>
<P>
   Approximate nutritional analysis per serving: 101 calories, 6.5
g fat, no cholesterol, 70 mg sodium.
</P>
<P>
   When I want a pumpkin pie taste without the trouble, I dig out
an old recipe for pumpkin custards. This version, from Short &AMP;
Sweet by Melanie Barnard (Houghton Mifflin, $25) is even easier.
You do need to bake the custards in a water bath for the proper
texture, but that's actually easy. Use a large baking pan or
roaster, fill halfway with hot water, and place the filled cups in
the bath to bake.
</P>
<P>
   SPICED PUMPKIN CUSTARDS
</P>
<P>
   Makes 6 servings
</P>
<P>
   1 1/4 cups half and half
</P>
<P>
   2/3 cup unsweetened pumpkin puree
</P>
<P>
   2 large eggs
</P>
<P>
   1/2 cup packed dark brown sugar
</P>
<P>
   1 teaspoon pumpkin pie spice or ground ginger
</P>
<P>
   2 tablespoons bourbon or dark rum, optional
</P>
<P>
   ginger lemon cream
</P>
<P>
   Preheat oven to 350 degrees. In a small saucepan, bring the half
and half to a simmer.
</P>
<P>
   In a mixing bowl whisk together the pumpkin, eggs, brown sugar,
spice and bourbon or rum. Slowly whisk the hot cream into the egg
mixture until well blended.
</P>
<P>
   Divide the custard among 6 custard cups. Place the cups in a
high-sided baking pan half filled with hot water. Bake the custards
in the water bath until they are nearly set in the center, about 25
to 30 minutes. Remove the cups from the water bath (it's easy if
you use sturdy tongs). Let cool for a few minutes to serve warm, or
refrigerate for as long as 8 hours.
</P>
<P>
   Serve with ginger lemon whipped cream.
</P>
<P>
   Whip 1 1/2 cups cream, add the grated zest of one lemon and 2
tablespoons minced ginger or crystallized ginger.
</P>
<P>

g fat, 89 mg cholesterol, 50 mg sodium.

   ByAUSTIN, Texas - Update: A couple of readers called to say they
had seen the frozen peanut butter and jelly sandwiches in the
freezer case at Sam's Clubs. The sandwiches were mentioned in this
column last week, but Smucker's had said they were not yet in
Texas, only the Midwest.
</P>
<P>
   Pyle on the veggies: Star Canyon's Stephan Pyles serves up his
favorite vegetarian recipes in a brand new cookbook that gives a
southwestern flavor to most of the dishes. But face it, you just
can't keep this fifth-generation West Texan down on the ranch, so
expect a few departures like Eggplant-Roasted Garlic Curry With
Lentils in ``Stephan Pyles Southwestern Vegetarian'' (Potter, $30).
Some of the recipes are fiveingredient simple; others, like the
Tortilla Vegetable Napoleon, go up to 40 ingredients (and beg for a
photograph.)
</P>
<P>
   Pyles acknowledges that he is still a card-carrying carnivore
and that these recipes could be served as entrees or side dishes.
Wonder which ones will appear on the menu at his Austin Star
Canyon, slated to open at the Stephen F. Austin Hotel in December?
</P>
<P>
   Tapioca tea: Sounds strange, but the San Jose Mercury News
reports that this cold drink is on the rise. Also known as pearl
tea or frothy milk tea, the mixture is shaken like a cocktail so
the resulting drink has a froth on top and pearls, or tapioca
balls, on the bottom. Made from yams and soaked in brown sugar, the
tapioca balls are slightly chewy and slippery, sucked up through an
oversized straw. The drink was introduced in Taiwan more than a
decade ago.
</P>
<P>
   With a Spanish accent: Cooking Light, the country's largest food
magazine, has announced that it will publish a new magazine geared
toward the Hispanic market. Gusto! will be out in April,
reflecting, like Cooking Light, both food and lifestyle. The editor
will be Cuban-born Viviana Carballo, whose work has appeared in the
Miami Herald and El Nuevo Herald.
</P>
<P>
   Dot-Com Combo: In Austin, we tend to find most foodstuffs we
need. For those who have not, however, maybe this new partnership
will help. Dean &AMP; Deluca, that well-known New York food retailer,
has hooked up with Epicurious.com, one of the country's top food
Web sites to offer some 800 items. Click on a food and Epicurious
will tell how to cook or serve it. A nice touch, but cooks can get
similar information by going directly to deandeluca.com. (FYI: The
price of Beluga caviar (2.2 pounds) is $2,350 at both sites.)
</P>

   Items for this column are drawn from wire reports, mail,
personal observation and comments from readers. To pass on a

   A 6-pound pumpkin sitting on the kitchen counter can be an
intimidating ingredient.
</P>
<P>
   So when the recipe calls for ``peeled, seeded pumpkin cubes''
here's what you do:
</P>
<P>
   Forget about using a vegetable peeler. Get out a big, heavy
knife.
</P>
<P>
   Put the pumpkin on a cutting board and cut into quarters. Use a
spoon or melon baller to remove seeds. Place a quarter pumpkin cut
side down. To cut off the skin, slice down from top to bottom.
Don't worry about the waste _ this is a cheap vegetable.
</P>
<P>
   Then cut the pumpkin flesh into wedges or cubes, depending on
the recipe.
</P>
<P>
   If the recipe calls for pumpkin puree, as most desserts do,
steaming the pumpkin is better than boiling it, which can make the
pumpkin even more watery than it is naturally. Chef Diana Alspaugh
suggests oven-steaming pumpkin cubes. Put them in a large roasting
pan or a foil-lined broiling pan, add 1/2 cup of water, cover with
foil (dull side out), and roast in a 350-degree oven. Timing varies
with the density of the pumpkin. It ranges from 30-60 minutes. The
pumpkin cubes should be tender and easily pierced with the tip of a
sharp knife.
</P>
<P>
   Puree the pumpkin in a ricer or food mill. A food processor can
be used for the very smooth puree that's desirable in a pie.
</P>
<P>
   For many side dishes the cubes are seasoned and oven-roasted
uncovered until browned, adding to the flavor. Be sure to oil the
bottom of the pan and lightly oil or butter the squash cubes.

 &HT;    Don't be a pumpkin bumpkin
 &HT;    Cooking varieties are good for more than just making pies
 &HT;    By Ann Heller
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   DAYTON, Ohio - There's more to pumpkin than jack-o'-lanterns and
more to eat than pumpkin pie.
</P>
<P>
   Just ask Bonnie Mercuri of Bonnybrook Farms in Centerville.
She's been growing specialty pumpkins for four years, and this year
her harvest of cooking pumpkins ranges from an oversized
muffin-shaped blue pumpkin called Queensland Blue to tiny Wee B
Little specimens.
</P>
<P>
   And while she's not one to put down a pumpkin pie, the dish
etched in her memory is pumpkin stew.
</P>
<P>
   That's one of the dishes fixed by chef Diana Alspaugh, who's
been on the receiving end of Mercuri's cooking pumpkins in recent
years. Alspaugh rides at Bonnybrook's stables, and when the owners
found out she's a chef, they started giving her pumpkins to test.
</P>
<P>
   Alspaugh, executive chef at Sinclair Community College, has a
history of using fresh pumpkin.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I was at Kitty's (a former downtown restaurant), I
roasted pumpkin cubes and served that with sage cream on penne,''
she says. At The Courtyard, another downtown restaurant, she used
fresh pumpkin puree in cheesecake.
</P>
<P>
   Her experiments with Bonnybrook's cooking pumpkins have expanded
her repertoire.
</P>
<P>
   Not all pumpkins are good for eating. Certainly not the one sold
for the traditional jack-o'-lantern. And even some sold as cooking
pumpkins can be watery and bland. It pays to buy by name.
</P>
<P>
   In three years of cooking with specialty pumpkins, Alspaugh has
identified the best varieties.
</P>
<P>
   The deep red Rouge Vif d'Etampes, a French heirloom pumpkin,
springs to her mind first.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's all edible with low water content and not a lot of
seeds,'' she says. ``And it has flavor.''
</P>
<P>
   The Buckskin is prized for its deep orange flesh. Whangaparoa, a
gray-blue pumpkin from New Zealand, is ``outstanding,'' she says.
The Jarrahdale, another blue-skinned pumpkin from Australia,
``makes the best pies.'' Hokaido, with a fiberless and dry flesh
that's like a winter squash, is another favorite but it's not
always available.
</P>
<P>
   For most Americans pumpkin is synonymous with pie, and that's
pie made with a can of pumpkin puree. Pumpkin bread also has a
small following and pumpkin muffins show up alongside seasonal
pumpkin ice cream scooped up at Halloween.
</P>
<P>
   The key for a new attitude about pumpkin, Mercuri says, is just
thinking of pumpkin like winter squash. And chefs around the
country are adding their own spin to the native harvest. In the
past decade, various styles of pumpkin soup began showing up on the
menus of chefs who like to focus on native produce.
</P>
<P>
   They also have borrowed extensively from other cuisines, which
have taken a more imaginative approach to pumpkins and squash.
Italians may lead the way. Consider this specialty: wedges of
pumpkin, dusted with flour and sauteed, then topped with fresh
tomato sauce. Or pumpkin turned into a soup made hearty with broken
spaghetti. Or that signature dish of northern Italy, tortelli (or
ravioli), filled with a mixture of pumpkin and Parmesan, and sauced
with butter and more Parmesan cheese.
</P>
<P>
   American chefs have followed that lead, adding Indian curry to
the pumpkin soup and Sichuan peppercorns to sauteed pumpkin.
</P>
<P>
   We don't go quite that far, but we're taking pumpkin to a new
level with recipe on Page 4C for Alspaugh's pumpkin stew.

 &HT;    BUSH POUNDS EDUCATION , RAISES CASH
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   George W. Bush pressed for new incentives for math and science
teachers Tuesday in Redwood City, Calif., on the edge of Silicon
Valley, and raised money for Republicans in California, where he
trails Al Gore. Bush spent a second day on the West Coast promoting
his 10-year, $47 billion education package and reiterating his
claim that the nation is in the grip of an ``education recession.''
He also was headlining two fund-raisers in California designed to
bring $1.4 million for the state GOP.
</P>
<P>
   CHENEY HITS GORE ON CREDIBILITY
</P>
<P>
   Dick Cheney charged Tuesday that Al Gore ``has failed to speak
the truth'' about all sorts of things, from claiming he helped
invent the Internet to misrepresenting the Republican presidential
ticket's Medicare plan. In a speech at a Polish cultural center in
Troy, Mich., Cheney accused Gore of ``distorted and demagogic''
characterizations of George W. Bush's prescription drug plan for
Medicare and presented a laundry list of other Gore assertions that
he called ``not true. False.'' Cheney said seniors would be much
better off with Bush's Medicare plan, saying Gore's proposal ``is
not leadership; it's gimmickry.'' Cheney also was visiting Detroit
and Philadelphia today.
</P>
<P>
   SERIOUS QUESTIONS FOR GORE ON MTV
</P>
<P>
   ``Boxers or briefs'' is so yesterday, so Bill Clinton. For Al
Gore, MTV was the place today to talk about more substantive
issues. Gore promised that a ban on the police practice of racial
profiling will, if he is elected president, ``be the first civil
rights act of the 21st century.'' He made the pledge at the
University of Michigan during a taping of the hip cable channel's
``Choose Or Lose'' program, to be broadcast at 8 p.m. tonight. En
route to Michigan from Florida, Gore appeared flummoxed when a
reporter asked if he was prepared to answer ``boxers or briefs?''
``Oh, God. I'd better . . . work on that one,'' he moaned. MTV
representatives said George W. Bush has been invited to make a
similar appearance, but has not yet accepted.
</P>
<P>
   WORKING TO SOLIDIFY LEAD IN NEW JERSEY
</P>
<P>
   Joe Lieberman took a swipe at George W. Bush's claim that he
offers ``real plans for real people,'' telling senior citizens
Tuesday that Bush's Medicare package is ``a real problem for real
seniors.'' In an address to about 300 senior citizens in Union,
N.J., Lieberman said that with the prices of prescription drugs
increasing and the number of baby boomers entering the Medicare
system expected to skyrocket, ``That's not just a price crisis in
my opinion; it is a prescription for a humanitarian crisis.'' The
Democrats hoped that Lieberman's appearance before seniors -- and
later, before union bricklayers in Atlantic City -- will help
solidify the Democratic lead in New Jersey. The state, with 15
electoral votes, favors the Gore-Lieberman ticket, according to
recent polls.
</P>
<P>
   PRESSURE ON TO EXIT SENATE RACE
</P>
<P>
   With Democrats growing increasingly hopeful about their chances
of regaining control of the Senate this fall, several of Joe
Lieberman's colleagues are pressuring him to let another
Connecticut Democrat seek his Connecticut Senate seat so that the
party won't lose it if he becomes vice president. Among those
Senate colleagues are Harry Reid (Nev.), Byron Dorgan (N.D.) and
Robert Torricelli (N.J.). Under state law, Lieberman is permitted
to run for both offices at the same time. But if he wins both, he
would give up his Senate seat and Gov. John Rowland, a Republican,
would be able to appoint his replacement. Lieberman's rival for the
vice presidency, Dick Cheney, took a shot Tuesday, saying
Lieberman's decision to stick with the Senate contest shows a lack
of confidence in his vice- presidential bid.
</P>
<P>
   NARAL TO TARGET VOTES IN 15 STATES
</P>
<P>
   The National Abortion and Reproductive Rights Action League is
about to announce plans for a $5 million, 15-state grass-roots
campaign designed to affect the outcome of the presidential race as
well as key Senate and House contests by targeting independent and
Republican voters who support abortion rights. The organization has
established a ``worst choice'' list of candidates that the
organization will be ``aggressively seeking to defeat,'' beginning
with George W. Bush, said NARAL President Kate Michelman. Beyond
the presidential race, NARAL hopes to affect the outcome of nine
Senate races and about two dozen House contests.
</P>
<P>
   APPEAL MADE TO FOLLOW N.Y. LEAD ON SOFT MONEY
</P>
<P>
   The Senate's leading supporters of campaign finance legislation
appealed to Al Gore and George W. Bush to follow the lead set in
New York's Senate race and ban soft money ads in their battle for
the White House. ``In the same spirit that motivated the
Lazio-Clinton agreement, we respectfully encourage you to attempt
to make a similar agreement in your race,'' wrote Sens. John McCain
(R-Ariz.) and Russell Feingold (D-Wis.). ``Specifically, we urge
you . . . to reject any efforts by political parties to use soft
money to run independent radio or television advertisements in an
attempt to influence your race, and to appeal to independent
organizations to refrain from doing the same.'' Similar letters
were sent to all candidates for the House and Senate.
</P>
<P>
   CLINTON WILL STILL HELP RAISE SOFT MONEY
</P>
<P>
   Hillary Clinton said that she'll continue to help raise soft
money for the Democratic Party even though she's agreed with her
opponent, Rick Lazio, not to allow advertisements in their New York
Senate race paid for with the largely unregulated contributions.
Clinton said that she had helped raise money over the years for
Democratic candidates and that she had promised the party she'd
participate in additional fund-raising activities before the
election on Nov. 7 _ a pledge, she said, not affected by her deal
with Lazio to ban the use of soft money in their television and
radio advertising. Campaign officials said Clinton would be out of
the state on Thursday and Friday raising money. Clinton said that
she would have no say in how the soft money she raised would be
spent.
</P>
<P>
   GOP SPENDING IN DEMOCRATIC-LEANING STATES
</P>
<P>
   The Republican National Committee contributed at least $1
million to nine different state parties last month, Federal
Election Commission records show. Besides giving millions to state
parties in Ohio and Michigan, the RNC also made seven-figure
transfers last month to California and Washington state, both of
which voted Democratic in recent presidential elections and where
close races for seats in Congress are being waged this year. The
RNC transferred $2.3 million to Pennsylvania, $2.2 million to Ohio
and $1.7 million to Michigan last month, three key battlegrounds.
The RNC also gave $1.7 million apiece to the Washington and
California state parties. Recent polls give Gore a double-digit
lead in the Golden State, and a slight edge in Washington state.
</P>
<P>
   DRUG COMPANY DONATIONS TO GOP
</P>
<P>
   Three major pharmaceutical companies contributed $600,000 to
Senate Republican campaign coffers in a 13-day period in August as
Democrats in a number of tight Senate races stepped up promotion of
a prescription drug benefit opposed by the industry. The three
$200,000 ``soft money'' contributions, from Eli Lilly,
Bristol-Myers Squibb and Pharmacia &AMP; Upjohn Co., indicated growing
concern by the companies and the GOP that the prescription drug
issue is proving a potent one for Democrats in a number of close
races. Campaign reports for August filed with the Federal Election
Commission also show contributions to the Republican National
Committee of $100,000 and $107,200, respectively, from
Bristol-Myers and another pharmaceutical giant, Schering-Plough.
</P>
<P>
   PLOT THICKENS IN PURLOINED TAPE CASE
</P>
<P>
   While aides to George W. Bush say there may be a mole in their
midst, Texas Democrats are blaming the Republican campaign's top
dog for leaking sensitive information to the enemy camp. At issue:
How a debate preparation tape and confidential campaign documents
made it into the hands of a confidant of Al Gore. The FBI is
investigating. The Bush camp suggested the Gore campaign had
planted a spy in Austin. But Molly Beth Malcolm, Texas Democratic
chairman, offered up a different scenario: Karl Rove, Bush's chief
political consultant, manufactured the incident to create a
distraction from a campaign struggling to regain its footing.
``This has Karl Rove's fingerprints written all over it,'' Malcolm
said. She offered no proof to back up her contention.
</P>
<P>
   SUBLIMINAL REACTION FROM MAGAZINE
</P>
<P>
   The cover of The New Republic's Oct. 2 issue looks a lot like
any other cover of the weekly political magazine. But careful
readers might notice something different. In the solid red bar that
appears on cover of every issue are these barely visible words:
Don't Trust Arafat. But inside, there is no article on Palestinian
leader Yasser Arafat. What gives? Editor Peter Beinart said he ran
the hidden headline as ``a response to the media obsession with
subliminal advertising,'' referring to the brouhaha that erupted
after the barely visible word ``RATS'' flashed in an ad for George
W. Bush, intentionally or otherwise.
</P>
<P>
   ``If everyone was suddenly venting their deepest darkest
obsession in subliminal ways,'' said Beinart, ``why not us? It's a
humorous caricature of our position.''
</P>
<P>
   HOPING THAT PRACTICE MAKES PERFECT
</P>
<P>
   George W. Bush jokes that the problem with engaging in mock
debates with Sen. Judd Gregg of New Hampshire is that often ``he
wins.'' Gregg has been playing the role of Al Gore in practice
sessions with Bush. And while Bush likes to give the impression
that he isn't putting much time or energy into such rehearsals, the
preparation has been under way for months. With the first debate a
week away (Oct. 3), Bush was heading to Austin on Wednesday for a
practice session. And at least one full 90-minute session with a
moderator and formal trappings is planned for the weekend. But
there's a danger in rehearsing too much, Bush says: ``Either you're
ready or you're not ready.'' He thinks he is.
</P>
<P>
   GORE AND BUSH: BACK TO BACK
</P>
<P>
   Joe Menichini, owner of the Keystone Massage Therapy Center in
Kingston, Pa., gave massage therapy to both George W. Bush and Al
Gore on successive days this month, according to the Wilkes-Barre
Citizen's Voice. Menichini said he was approached by Secret Service
agents on Sept. 5, then introduced to Bush. The masseur said he was
``nervous,'' but that Bush was ``really nice.'' The very next day,
Gore received a massage from Menichini's therapy center. The Gore
campaign had booked an appointment weeks before. Menichini said
Gore ``talked for the first five minutes, but he was really tired
and just relaxed because it was late.''
</P>
<P>
   DEMOCRATIC WIVES ON THE ROAD
</P>
<P>
   Hadassah Lieberman, wife of the vice-presidential nominee, and
Hillary Clinton visited Riverdale Young Men's and Young Women's
Hebrew Association in the Bronx, N.Y. They met with local seniors
to discuss providing a voluntary prescription drug benefit for
seniors on Medicare, extending the solvency of Medicare and
modernizing Medicare. Tipper Gore, wife of the presidential
candidate, was campaigning in Cincinnati and Paducah, Ky.
</P>
<P>
   PORNOGRAPHERS FOR GORE?
</P>
<P>
   Comedians and competitors have made Al Gore sorry for claiming
credit in the birth of the Internet. Now online pornographers are
being encouraged to show their gratitude to the candidate. Reuters
new agency reports that a featured speaker at a trade show for the
Internet adult entertainment industry said a Gore presidency would
be good for business. ``The big message from the Gore camp has been
that there should be no control over the content of speech, but
control over access to the speech by individuals who are
underage,'' attorney Paul Cambria was quoted as saying at the
gathering. He labeled George W. Bush the pro-censorship candidate.
</P>
<P>
   NO HOLDS BARR-ED IN GEORGIA
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Bob Barr, a Georgia Republican, is airing his first TV spot
against Democrat Roger Kahn. The Barr camp, in a prepared
statement, described the ad as ``a lighthearted look'' at Kahn's
``recent move to the Seventh District.'' Barr calls Kahn a
carpetbagger, saying he moved to the district only last year. Kahn
previously lived in Key West, Fla., and the Buckhead section of
Atlanta before moving to Bartow County, according to the Barr
campaign. Barr, himself, is originally from Iowa.
</P>
<P>
   CANCER SURGERY FOR N.D. GUBERNATORIAL HOPEFUL
</P>
<P>
   North Dakota Democratic gubernatorial candidate Heidi Heitkamp,
the state attorney general, underwent cancer surgery, five days
after doctors discovered the cancer in her right breast. The
operation is normally accompanied by weeks of follow-up treatment,
including chemotherapy and radiation, but campaign manager Denise
Lawson said Heitkamp, 44, intends to continue her run for governor.
Her Republican opponent, John Hoeven, said he was ``deeply
concerned about Heidi's health. We wish her a full and speedy
recovery, and will keep her and her family in our prayers.''
Hoeven, a banker, had ordered his campaign ads on radio and
television pulled for a few days after Heitkamp's diagnosis was
announced.
</P>
<P>
   REFORM PARTY'S FOSTER LINKED TO STRESS ILLNESS
</P>
<P>
   Reform Party vice-presidential candidate Ezola Foster was
prescribed an anti-depressant drug for most of 1997 and took breaks
from her job as a Los Angeles schoolteacher several times during
bouts of depression dating to the 1970s, according to records of
the state workers' compensation appeals board. The records indicate
Foster filed for workers' compensation three times, twice claiming
that she was mentally unable to return to a hostile work
environment. The reports were released to the Los Angeles Times
after a workers' comp judge denied Foster's request to seal her
file. Foster, an outspoken black conservative, is Reform Party
presidential nominee Pat Buchanan's choice for a running mate.
</P>
<P>
   YOUNG VOTERS: HIGH INTEREST, LOW INTENT
</P>
<P>
   Young voters are very interested in the top political issues,
but that doesn't appear to translate into plans to vote. Fewer than
half of adults ages 18 to 24 say they definitely will vote in
November, a new poll says. The survey, sponsored by the Kaiser
Family Foundation and MTV, noted that 64 percent of all adults say
they plan to vote, while only 46 percent of those younger than 25
say they are ``absolutely'' certain to vote in November. ``Voting
participation has been lower for young adults ever since the
18-year-olds got the right to vote in 1972,'' said Vicky Rideout,
who directed the survey. ``It's been going down every year except
for 1992. And we're on track again for low participation of young
voters.''

 &HT;    CENSUS BUREAU REPORTS RISING INCOMES, FALLING POVERTY
 &HT;    530&AMP;add.
 &HT;    With CENSUS-DATA.
 &HT;    By CHARLES W. HOLMES
 &HT;    c.2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The typical American family broke the $40,000
barrier last year as the humming economy pushed income levels to
record highs and poverty rates to record lows, the Census Bureau
reported Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Americans enjoyed income gains for a record fifth consecutive
year in 1999, with inflation-adjusted earnings rising to a median
$40,816, its highest level since the survey began measuring income
data in 1967. Half of all households made more than the median
amount, and half made less.
</P>
<P>
   The strong economy also drove the poverty rate to its lowest
level in two decades, with the number of poor people last year
falling by 2.2 million compared to 1998. It was the third straight
year that the nation's poverty rate declined, to 11.8 percent from
12.7 percent in 1998. However, the rate remained above the historic
low of 11.1 percent set in 1973.
</P>
<P>
   In 1999, a total of 32.3 million people lived below the poverty
line, defined as $17,029 for a family of four and $13,290 for a
family of three.
</P>
<P>
   The effect of the rolling good times were widely felt by whites,
blacks, Hispanics and Asians, according to the income and poverty
data. However, poverty among foreign-born residents remained
unchanged.
</P>
<P>
   Poverty in the South remained statistically unchanged from 1998,
but still at its all-time low of 13.1 percent.
</P>
<P>
   The 1999 median household income reached record levels in the
South, at $37,422, and in the Midwest, but remained unchanged from
1998 in the Northeast and West.
</P>
<P>
   While the numbers were positive _ median inflation-adjusted
income up 2.7 percent from $39,744 in 1998 _ the 1999 figure was
only about $2,000 higher than the level in 1989, or about a $4 a
week increase in earnings when averaged over the decade.
</P>
<P>
   Overall household earnings did not grow as fast in 1999 and they
did the previous year, and did not keep pace with the overall
growth of the economy. Incomes rose 2.7 percent from 1998 to 1999,
compared to a 3.5 percent jump from 1997 to 1998.
</P>
<P>
   ``What we have here is evidence that wage growth is actually
slowing in an economy that has been growing,'' said Jared Bernstein
of the labor-backed Economic Policy Institute.
</P>
<P>
   The institute, a Washington research group, calculates that
middle-income families had to work 33 more hours in 1999 to
maintain the same standard of living.
</P>
<P>
   The government's annual snapshot of wealth and poverty, based on
a survey of 50,000 American households and released each year in
late September, provided fodder for Democrats and Republicans just
six weeks before the election.
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton immediately hailed the report as ``another
economic milestone'' for the Clinton-Gore administration. ``This is
a good day for America,'' Clinton said. ``We have proved that we
can lift all boats in a modern, global, information-based
economy.''
</P>
<P>
   Congressional Republicans credited the welfare reforms they
endorsed and enacted in 1996 with lowering the numbers of poor
people. Rep. E. Clay Shaw, R-Fla., a member of the House Ways and
Means Committee, said that without welfare reform, there would be
``more children in poverty and more adults getting a welfare check
instead of a paycheck.''
</P>
<P>
   (Story can end here. Optional add follows.)
</P>
<P>
   Except for whites, the poverty rate for the nation's major
racial and ethnic groups set or equaled historic lows, the Census
Bureau said. The rate for African-Americans was 23.6 percent;
Hispanics, 22.8 percent; Asian and Pacific Islanders, 10.7 percent;
and non-Hispanic whites, 7.7 percent.
</P>
<P>
   While some regions fared better than others, no state saw income
fall or poverty increase from 1998 levels, based on comparisons of
two-year averages.
</P>
<P>
   The decline in poverty was concentrated in major cities, while
poverty rates in suburbs, small towns and rural areas changed only
slightly. Poverty dropped in just seven states and the District of
Columbia, while remaining at 1998 levels elsewhere.
</P>
<P>
   Economic analysts said the report was positive, but pointed to
some trouble signs:
</P>
<P>
   _ The poverty rate for children, 16.9 percent, was the lowest
since 1979, with 1.4 million fewer children classified as poor in
1999. Yet children remain particularly vulnerable, since they make
up 26 percent of the total population, but 38 percent of the poor.
The news is worse for children under the age of 6 living with a
mother but no father. Their poverty rate last year was 50.3
percent, more than five times the rate for children living in
two-parent families.
</P>
<P>
   _ After reaching an all-time high in earnings compared to men in
1996, women's income relative to men is backsliding slightly.
Full-time working women earned 74 cents on the dollar compared to
men in 1996, and 72 cents last year.
</P>
<P>
   _ While the report says the poorer are not getting poorer, the
Census Bureau figures do not fully calculate just how much richer
the rich are becoming.
</P>
<P>
   The study defines wealthiest Americans as households earning
more than $1 million, but does not analyze further what is
occurring at the upper reaches of that group, where other economic
surveys show that wealth as grown in recent years as a result of
the booming economy and gains in equity markets. Also, the Census
Bureau measures income based on wages, and not income from capital
gains, dividends and other sources.
</P>
<P>
   ``For what's happened in this country since 1993, it doesn't
tell us much. The top group (of earners) has done amazingly well
and the census data simply doesn't pick it up,'' said Isaac
Shapiro, an economist with the Washington-based Center on Budget
and Policy Priorities.
</P>
<P>
   Only a more detailed economic analysis using data from income
tax returns and other sources would give a more reliable picture of
the nation's affluent, said Daniel Weinberg, chief of the housing
and household economic statistics division of the Census Bureau.
</P>
<P>
   The Census Bureau, the Office of Management and Budget and other
federal agencies are conducting a long-term study on other possible
measures which could revise the way income and poverty are
measured. The current formulas have changed relatively little since
the system was created in the mid-1960s as part of President Lyndon
Johnson's ``war on poverty.''

<P>
   WESTPORT, Mass. _ To most outsiders, the southeastern coast of
New England is a stretch of tranquil countryside, a blur of old
stone fences and shady country roads on the way to Cape Cod. A
place where ospreys nest along the tidal Westport River, and where
black and white cows graze in pastures all the way down to the
shoreline.
</P>
<P>
   But the region is also blessed with the longest growing season
in all of New England and a sunny temperate climate like that of
northern France. And like that part of France, it is the source for
oysters so fine that they are sold by name, and wines that are
served in some of the leading restaurants in Boston and New York.
One of the best American blue cheeses is made here, not far from
centuries-old apple orchards and farms that are experimenting with
cutting-edge technology in fish farming.
</P>
<P>
   All of the region's exceptional bounty is the result of hand
labor on the kind of small farms that were on the verge of
disappearing just a few years ago. Like other small farms around
the country, they are being rescued by agricultural artisans who
have learned to offer the quality that satisfies a more
appreciative and sophisticated America.
</P>
<P>
   In Westport, there is a plan that is beyond ambitious: to
preserve the rural coastline and make the region as famous for its
food and wine as Sonoma County in California or the Hudson Valley
in New York state.
</P>
<P>
   A group of preservationists has named the region the Heritage
Farm Coast, a designation that includes Westport, Dartmouth,
Fairhaven and Marion in Massachusetts, and Tiverton and Little
Compton in Rhode Island. The center of the revitalization efforts
is Westport, still the most rural of all the towns along the coast
and ripe for overdevelopment. Until the end of World War II,
Westport was a thriving farming and fishing community and the bread
basket for New Bedford and Fall River, large towns that have
themselves fallen on hard times.
</P>
<P>
   Right now, the big question for the area is ``how to promote our
uniqueness, the fishing, farming, food and wine,'' said Bob
Russell, who with his wife, Carol, is the de facto leader of the
preservation movement. Their winery, Westport River Vineyards, sits
on land that has been farmed since 1652. The Russells started the
winery in 1982. They bought a nearby farm five years ago, to
prevent it from becoming a housing development. Now, it is the site
of their latest effort, Buzzards Bay Brewery.
</P>
<P>
   The Russells' vineyard is one of three in the area, the best
known being Sakonnet Vineyards, which was started in 1975 in Little
Compton. Situated on one of the most beautifully manicured
vineyards in the United States _ the land around the vineyards
could be croquet courts _ its wines are served at places like Mesa
Grill in Manhattan.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a great food wine,'' Mollie Battenhouse, the general
manager of Best Cellars in Manhattan, said of Sakonnet's Vidal
Blanc. ``It's crisp with a high acid content and a little residual
sugar.''
</P>
<P>
   Sparkling wines from Westport Vineyards have been getting high
marks and some visibility at the White House, and even on the
television series ``West Wing.'' They will be on the menu of
Olives, the restaurant that Todd English is opening in New York
this fall.
</P>
<P>
   Beyond wines, the Farm Coast produces a dream list of
high-quality ingredients, but most of what is grown here never
leaves home. Marketing has always been the biggest stumbling block
for farmers, but those who have learned that it is essential are
making a living. A few, like Tim and Tina Stone of Great Hill
Dairy, are doing very well.
</P>
<P>
   The Stones couldn't earn a living as dairy farmers, so they
looked for something more, what is called in business a value-added
product.
</P>
<P>
   ``We got into cheese because we couldn't make it otherwise,''
said Stone, a tall, lanky man, who leases his land, part of 500
magnificent acres on the shore of Buzzards Bay in Marion once owned
by his great-grandfather. ``When our two sons were born, we knew we
wanted to find another way to stay here and live on a farm.''
</P>
<P>
   Stone gave up a career as an engineer to make Great Hill Blue, a
fine aged blue cheese with a full, mellow flavor and a national
reputation. ``The Marion General Store was the first place that
bought our cheese,'' he said. ``I peddled it myself.''
</P>
<P>
   Now, it has a following that includes Kevin Tyldesley, who
chooses the cheeses for Gramercy Tavern in Manhattan. ``This is a
lot more subtle than Roquefort,'' he said, ``but it's not a dumbed
down cheese. It's very complex.''
</P>
<P>
   In 1993, the Stones sold 12,000 pounds of the rich raw milk
cheese; they expect to top 52,000 pounds this year.
</P>
<P>
   Eva Sommaripa, a former potter, is considered the most
successful farmer in the area _ even though she tills all of two
acres. Her amazingly fragrant herbs are cut to order for some of
Boston's top chefs.
</P>
<P>
   Her business, Eva's Garden, has been growing organic herbs for
more than 20 years in Dartmouth, including basil that you cannot
resist the temptation to pluck and rub between your fingers. Not
content to grow the ordinary, Sommaripa has recently leased some
additional land to experiment with growing herbs in high shade in
the forest.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of chefs have our name on their menus, so a lot of
people come to visit,'' Sommaripa said. ``There is a basic
satisfaction feeling connected to the earth and the source of your
sustenance.''
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Chris Schlesinger, a chef and an occasional contributor to the
Dining Section, is one of the few local representatives of the
restaurant side of the farm-chef equation. His Westport restaurant,
the Back Eddy, features local ingredients. ``Right now, there are
just baby steps between chefs and growers,'' he said. ``Other than
Eva's Garden, no growers are being asked to grow for chefs, but we
are starting and that's the break. That's the critical mass.''
</P>
<P>
   Early on, Coll Walker, whose roadside stand in Little Compton
has been a fixture for 30 years, realized he would not survive
selling wholesale. ``I saw retail as the only way to go,'' he said.
``Rather than being at the mercy of the middleman, we really stress
quality.''
</P>
<P>
   In addition to the sparkling fresh greens and corn whose silks
are still damp, Walker sells his own fruit preserves, honeys and
relishes. He has shared his roadside space with a popular coffee
shop and bakery, Olga's Cup and Saucer, for 13 years.
</P>
<P>
   The aromas drifting from the shop draw people who might not even
have been thinking about a half-dozen ears of corn for that night's
dinner. With open fields across the road and the Sakonnet River
just down the hill behind the stand, it's the perfect spot to
linger over a cup of espresso and a warm croissant.
</P>
<P>
   At Noquochoke Orchards, Sue and George Smith and their four
children raise 95 varieties of heirloom apples with names like
Rhode Island greenings, Baldwins, Northern Spy and Winesaps, as
well as other fruits and vegetables. They also have a roadside
stand, which is often untended and on the honor system.
</P>
<P>
   Their 79-acre farm runs down to the water's edge and has been in
the family since 1899. Even though developers offered them $1.5
million for the land, Smith couldn't bear to see it turned into
house lots. ``George's father and mother worked too hard for
that,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   As we toured the orchards, with old trees that require ladders
for picking, dwarf trees that can be picked from the ground, and
the latest, trees trellised like grapevines, Smith was eager to
talk about her efforts to reduce the use of pesticides by spraying
only when necessary. Her husband says he likes it because it's
cheaper.
</P>
<P>
   Some people, eager to stay in the region and farm, have gone
down more unusual paths.
</P>
<P>
   On his farm, Jim Munger is growing hydroponic tomatoes and
raising striped bass; the water in which the fish swim is filtered
and mixed with other nutrients and then fed to the tomatoes.
``Farming is in my blood,'' said Munger, who is a retired teacher.
``So, as soon as I was able, I bought a farm and taught chemistry.
I combined my vocation and avocation and brought my students out
here to teach them environmental science.''
</P>
<P>
   The striped bass effort is still just beginning. ``I'm sure you
can make a living at this,'' he said, ``but it has to be on a large
scale.''
</P>
<P>
   At 10 one perfect sunny morning, Jimmy Wood was dumping bushel
after bushel of just-picked corn onto tables at his vegetable stand
in Westport. Even though there are two other vegetable stands close
by, Wood managed to increase his business 25 percent this summer.
The trick was simple enough, paving over a patch of land to make a
parking lot. He paid for it with a grant of $20,000 that
Massachusetts provides to farmers who guarantee they will stay in
business for a certain number of years. Next year, he's adding a
cooler to keep the produce fresher and an ice cream stand.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can make a good living,'' said Wood, whose wife, Joan,
manages the stand during the summer. ``But to run a very successful
stand is more demanding than anyone can imagine. It's 10 to 12
hours a day, seven days a week.''
</P>
<P>
   Westport once had more dairy farms than any other town in the
state. Today, there are only 12 left. Dairy farmers all over New
England have fallen on hard times, and even though those in
Westport get very little money for their milk, most of them are
reluctant to start making ice cream or yogurt or cheese. These are
the farmers most tempted to sell their land to developers _
especially when they are offered millions of dollars an acre for
waterfront property.
</P>
<P>
   Westport was also once an important fishing port, but
overfishing of the Westport River and the bay took a drastic toll.
Seth Garfield, who has summered on Cuttyhunk Island for all but
three of his 43 years, has been leasing a 30-acre saltwater pond
there since 1981, and raising oysters from seed. We met on a dock,
at the end of the day. Sun- and wind-burned, in the fashion of
people who are outside all day, Garfield said his least favorite
time of the day is the three hours when he makes his rounds seeing
his customers. He'd rather be with his oysters.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I started it, no one was doing it,'' he said. Even with
competition, he says, he could sell four times as many oysters as
he raises. In the summer, his company delivers oysters, clams and
cooked shrimp directly to boats from his floating raw bar.
</P>
<P>
   A part-time school teacher, he is taking a sabbatical this year
to concentrate on his oyster business. Active in the Coalition for
Buzzards Bay, he is one of the people trying to reduce the
pollution from the runoff of the farms, a problem that sometimes
puts farmers and fishermen at odds.
</P>
<P>
   Oysters from his Cuttyhunk Shellfish Farms are highly prized and
are on the menu at the Oyster Bar in Grand Central Terminal in
Manhattan, among many other East Coast restaurants. Sandy Ingber,
the executive chef at the Oyster Bar, said he had been buying them
for many years. ``They have a nice crisp briny flavor,'' he said,
``and I have people coming in asking for them.''
</P>
<P>
   Not everyone wants to save the coastal area by making it a
culinary destination. There is a strong anti-regulatory streak in
New Englanders, as in ``You can't tell me what to do with my
land,'' and many zoning boards are more than happy to let the
developers put up cheek-by-jowl houses. Preservation efforts by the
state and private organizations are working hard to keep that from
happening. But turning the Heritage Farm Coast into Sonoma East
would certainly be a big help.
</P>
<P>
   Though Westport's population of 13,000 increases by several
thousand during the summer, when vacationers come to kayak and
fish, there are only two restaurants in town that use local
ingredients. Accommodations are limited to a chain motel and a
small bed and breakfast without private baths. At every level the
Heritage Farm Coast idea is in its infancy, and it's far too soon
to tell whether the effort will succeed.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nothing happens fast in agriculture,'' Bob Russell said. ``I'm
very cautious about saying we have been successful. But we are not,
yet, losing farms.''

WITH HERBS AND MORE HERBS, VINAIGRETTE GOES BEYOND SALAD 
</HEADLINE>
  (EDS: This is the seventh column of a series by Eberhard Mueller,
who is the executive chef and owner of Lutece; this was written
with JACK BISHOP.) 
 By EBERHARD MUELLER 
  
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Home cooks rarely think of vinaigrette as a sauce. In most
kitchens, vinaigrette has only one use: as a dressing for salad
greens.
</P>
<P>
   But if you bulk up oil and vinegar with plenty of good mustard
and fresh herbs, the familiar vinaigrette turns into something else
entirely, with a consistency almost like pesto. That shouldn't be
such a surprise: vinaigrette is a cold sauce, after all, just like
pesto, aioli and tapenade.
</P>
<P>
   My favorite herb vinaigrette calls for as much minced herbs as
oil. This sauce is too thick for drizzling over lettuce, but it
naps a piece of poached fish perfectly.
</P>
<P>
   For my herb vinaigrette, I use bits of every herb growing behind
my farmhouse. Minced basil, mint, chervil, garlic chives, parsley,
cilantro and chives create a vibrant sauce bursting with fresh herb
flavor.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, you can trade some complexity for simplicity and use
fewer herbs. Substitute more of another herb with similar intensity
if you can't track down every herb in the market. And remember that
freshness is as important as variety. Dull herbs make a dull
dressing.
</P>
<P>
   Another key to great herb flavor is a good mincing technique.
The first thing I teach young cooks in my restaurant is how to
handle herbs. Most cooks rock a chef's knife through herbs,
grinding them down into the board. This motion bruises the cell
structure and causes flavorful oils to be lost. If your cutting
board is dyed green every time you mince herbs, you're doing
something wrong. You want that flavor in your food, not the cutting
board.
</P>
<P>
   When I mince or chop herbs, I use a slicing motion. I pull the
front of the knife backward through a pile of herbs, rather than
pressing down and pushing the knife forward. (Using the front of
the knife is important. When most cooks mince, they grind the herbs
with the heavy back end of the knife.) I keep slicing the herbs
until they reach the texture I'm looking for. When I'm done, my
cutting board is clean.
</P>
<P>
   Minced this way, herbs have tremendous clarity of flavor. Even
though my vinaigrette calls for seven herbs, you can taste each
one.
</P>
<P>
   Because halibut is lean but meaty, it is the perfect fish for
this sauce. I poach the halibut, rather than grill or saute it, so
you can really taste the herbs. The poaching liquid is a quick
broth flavored with vegetables as well as white wine and vinegar
for acidity.
</P>
<P>
   You can easily play around with the vegetables in the broth,
adding fennel, celery, tomatoes, or even lemon grass. Or subtract
vegetables to make things simpler: just leeks, carrots and a bay
leaf will do, if that's all you have on hand. The idea is to use a
fair amount of vegetables _ as well as wine and vinegar _ so that
the broth is strong enough to flavor the fish. &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
POACHED HALIBUT WITH HERB VINAIGRETTE
</P>
<P>
   Time: 2 hours
</P>
<P>
   2 medium leeks, white and light green parts only, halved
lengthwise, cleaned and cut crosswise into several pieces
</P>
<P>
   2 medium carrots, peeled
</P>
<P>
   1 medium onion, sliced thick
</P>
<P>
   1 medium garlic clove, peeled
</P>
<P>
   2 tablespoons kosher salt
</P>
<P>
   15 white peppercorns
</P>
<P>
   1 bay leaf
</P>
<P>
   1 cup white wine
</P>
<P>
   1/3 cup white vinegar
</P>
<P>
   Several sprigs each fresh thyme and basil
</P>
<P>
   2 tablespoons Dijon mustard
</P>
<P>
   1 tablespoon sherry vinegar
</P>
<P>
   1{ teaspoons red wine vinegar
</P>
<P>
   Salt and freshly ground white pepper
</P>
<P>
   1/3 cup extra virgin olive oil
</P>
<P>
   3 tablespoons grapeseed oil
</P>
<P>
   Lemon juice to taste
</P>
<P>
   4 tablespoons minced chives or garlic chives or a mixture of
both
</P>
<P>
   2 tablespoons minced parsley
</P>
<P>
   2 tablespoons of mixture of 2 to 4 minced herbs: basil, mint,
cilantro and chervil
</P>
<P>
   4 skin-on halibut fillets, 8 to 9 ounces, about 1{ inches
thick. &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   1. Combine leeks, carrots, onion, garlic, kosher salt,
peppercorns and bay leaf in medium casserole with 6 cups water.
Bring to a boil, reduce heat, cover, and simmer until vegetables
are soft, about 20 minutes. Add wine and white vinegar, cover, and
cook 10 minutes. Add thyme and basil sprigs. Turn off heat and cool
to room temperature. Strain broth.
</P>
<P>
   2. Whisk mustard, sherry and red wine vinegars, and salt and
pepper to taste with 4 teaspoons water in bowl. Whisk in oils until
dressing is emulsified. Add a few drops of lemon juice. Whisk in
herbs. Let stand at least 10 minutes. (It can be covered and set
aside for 1 hour.)
</P>
<P>
   3. Pour broth into large deep skillet. Add the halibut. (Liquid
should just cover pieces; if not, add water.) Bring to a simmer
over medium heat; by then the fish should be opaque and firm. (If
not, turn off the heat and cover pan.) Peel off the skin. Divide
the fish among 4 plates, and spoon vinaigrette over. Yield: 4
servings.

SCALLOPS WITH SNAP 
</HEADLINE>
   By MARK BITTMAN    
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   A crisp edge on scallops really brings out their sweetness. It's
easy to achieve when you saute them: dredge them in flour, cornmeal
or bread crumbs before adding them to the hot pan. But if you give
the crunchy crust an intense flavor, they're even better.
</P>
<P>
   The most basic technique is to season the flour or cornmeal with
herbs or spices. But it's even easier to skip the flour and dredge
the scallops in spices. It can't be done with dried herbs, which
don't get crisp, or with spices that are too strong to use in
quantity. But it works perfectly with curry powder, which also
seasons whatever is cooked with the scallops' sauce. I add chopped
tomatoes, which liquefy to make a light sauce that is wonderful
over rice.
</P>
<P>
   Curry powder is not really a spice itself but a mixture of
cumin, turmeric, coriander, pepper and other spices. Since you're
using a large quantity, two tablespoons, it should not be super-hot
or the dish will be fiery. I prefer a mild, sweet curry powder. It
should also be fairly fine; if it is too coarse, the crust will be
gritty rather than crisp.
</P>
<P>
   Once the scallops are very lightly dredged in the curry powder,
you sear them quickly. They brown in just a minute or two, and you
don't want to cook them longer than that: scallops are best rare.
The dish is finished with the tomatoes, lime juice and cilantro or
another herb.
</P>
<P>
   I like to add a little fresh or sour cream or yogurt to the
sauce, which turns it pink and creamy. If you use yogurt, the sauce
must not boil after you add it or it will curdle; a minute after
adding the tomatoes, turn the heat down to a minimum and just let
the yogurt warm gently in the pan.
</P>
<P>
   You could also use chili powder or any other spice mix in place
of curry powder.
</P>
<P>
   As for the herb, cilantro marries perfectly with the lime and
curry, as does mint. But basil, especially the fragrant, minty Thai
basil, is a more surprising and equally delicious option.
</P>
<P>
   CURRIED SCALLOPS WITH TOMATOES
</P>
<P>
   Time: 20 minutes
</P>
<P>
   3 medium tomatoes
</P>
<P>
   1 tablespoon peanut or vegetable oil
</P>
<P>
   1{ to 2 pounds large sea scallops
</P>
<P>
   Salt and freshly ground black pepper
</P>
<P>
   2 tablespoons curry powder, or to taste
</P>
<P>
   { cup heavy cream, sour cream or yogurt, optional
</P>
<P>
   Juice of 1 lime
</P>
<P>
   { cup chopped fresh cilantro, Thai basil or mint.
</P>
<P>
   1. Core tomatoes, and squeeze and shake out their seeds. Chop
flesh into {-inch pieces and set aside. Heat the oil in a 12-inch
nonstick skillet over medium heat about 3 minutes. While it heats,
sprinkle scallops with salt and pepper, and spread curry powder on
a plate.
</P>
<P>
   2. When oil is hot, work quickly to dredge scallops lightly in
curry powder, and add to pan. About 2 minutes after you add first
scallop, turn it; it should be nicely browned. (If not, raise heat
a bit.) When scallops are all browned and turned, cook a minute
longer, and add tomatoes and heavy or sour cream if you're using
it. (If you are using yogurt, lower heat immediately; it must not
boil.)
</P>
<P>
   3. Heat tomatoes through. Taste and add more salt and pepper if
necessary. Sprinkle with lime juice, stir in herb and serve.
</P>
<P>
   Yield: 4 servings.

cc,78p3  Changing the way TV and Web interact 
(For use by New York Times News Service clients) 
 
By DAVID KRONKE 
c. 2000 Los Angeles Daily News 
<TEXT>
<P>
   ``Big Brother'' has changed the way reality television and new
media can interact.
</P>
<P>
   Don't laugh. As godawful as what you've seen on TV has been,
Internet viewers were granted an occasionally compelling moment.
What's more, Netizens changed both the dynamic in the house and the
TV show's content. In other words, audiences of the Internet feeds
literally wrested control of the show from its unimaginative
producers and, on rare occasions, created drama for TV viewers.
</P>
<P>
   ``Although I agree with the description of this show as a 'train
wreck,''' cracks Lauri Hoese of Austin, one of the Internet
conspirators, ``I'm searching for a better metaphor. You see, train
wrecks are interesting.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a cliche to joke about how it's like watching paint dry,
but when the final history of TV is written, 'Big Brother' will be
considered more important than the better and the more highly rated
'Survivor,''' declares Robert Thompson, founding director of
Syracuse University's Center for the Study of Popular Television.
</P>
<P>
   ``'Big Brother' provided a model that Internet users and TV
users might actually use, like no other convergence idea, like
'Enhanced TV,' did. Viewers took over the show, affecting
storylines, and carved out a powerful set of lessons that will be
applied in the future.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a new way of watching a television show. In the past,
someone made it, they showed it to us, we watched,'' Thompson
continues. ``Now they can create programs that are jumping-off
points, that can become a lifestyle. You watch the show, go to the
Internet and follow it some more, and use the Internet to plot and
become part of it. It takes control from out of the hands of the
people making the show and into the hands of who knows who.''
</P>
<P>
   Even George, the portly, high-strung roofer banished last week,
admitted he got his idea for a dramatic, if briefly considered,
mass walkout from one of the banners Hoese and Jeff Oswald, known
collectively as Media Jammers, flew over the Big Brother compound.
Even though the potential rebellion was quelled the day it began,
CBS milked the potential walkout for drama for four episodes.
</P>
<P>
   None of it might have happened had those responsible for ``Big
Brother'' been so incompetent. While it's been a hit in every
country it's aired in since debuting last year in the Netherlands,
everything, it seems, went wrong for ``Big Brother'' in America:
</P>
<P>
   Casting was a botch, heavy on trailer-park personalities,
self-absorbed 20-somethings and/or passive-aggressive sorts, a
group so self-conscious that few arguments and even less romantic
intrigue resulted inside the Studio City pressure cooker. Host
Julie Chen was initially seen as a cynical gambit to promote ``The
Early Show'' but emerged as worse miscasting than the houseguests.
</P>
<P>
   Viewers torpedoed CBS by voting out the show's most provocative
personalities, ensuring the house's general level of somnolence. In
fact, when the show offered the final six contestants $50,000 to
exit the house, the group valued their comraderie more than the
money: hardly the sort of dynamic the network had hoped to foster.
</P>
<P>
   Also perplexing was the producers' avoidance of potentially
provocative moments Eddie's racist jokes, Cassandra's vivid
description of an African trip, the houseguests' first disgusted
talk of rebellion and the airplane banners, which became so
ubiquitous, CBS finally couldn't ignore them.
</P>
<P>
   Whereas ``Big Brother'' preferred to pretend its producers were
in control, another reality series, BBC America's ``Castaway
2000,'' transforms its production woes into drama. ``Castaway,''
stranding 36 strangers on an island, documented the production's
inability to get the compound built in time for the show's kickoff
and its accidental destruction of some participants' belongings, as
well as the subsequent irate walkoff by key cast members.
</P>
<P>
   ``'Castaway' is really avoiding 'Big Brother's' mistake,''
Thompson points out. ``Here, they chose to bury the conflicts
between 'Big Brother' and the people in the house as if it would
harm the show, when in fact that could've made that show. And that
got the Internet dimension mad at the program itself. One of the
places where great drama can occur, which 'Big Brother' didn't
recognize, is in the conflicts between these innocent naives who
come into the show-business world only to be exploited by the evil
network. You can bet if CBS does 'Big Brother' again, things will
be very, very different.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, a ``BBII'' is virtually guaranteed, given impending
actors and writers strikes. Who wouldn't want to watch ordinary
folks struggling and even join in the battle against producers who
would gleefully posit themselves as corporate Richard Hatches, the
scheming ``Survivor'' champion, in an effort to show that Davids
can still best mega-media-conglomerate Goliaths? After all, reality
TV is all about getting its participants to squirm; who's to lose
if a show invites viewers to turn the tables?
</P>
<P>
   Though a bust on TV, ``Big Brother'' has been a boon to the
Internet. Its official Web site, Bigbrother2000.com, recorded 4.25
million user hits in July, the highest among new Web sites. Viewers
to that site, late on the night of Aug. 14, witnessed a revolution
sputter to life in Studio City. The houseguests were all cranky,
having been forced to perform a profane 'roast' with scripted gags
that insulted one another.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was angry that CBS edited the second roast to make it appear
as if the houseguests themselves had come up with those horrible
'jokes,''' says Kaye Mallory, known to the houseguests as Megaphone
Lady. (She tipped them off to the network's impending offer of
money to leave the house, allowing them to steel themselves against
looking greedy on-air, and encouraged them during their recent
potential rebellion.) ``So when George and Britt talked about
walking out together, I was in total agreement. That started the
whole thing. I had to get a megaphone and let them know I was
behind them.''
</P>
<P>
   Also appalled was the group at Salon.com's ``Big Brother'' Table
Talk thread, where Hoese, Oswald and others exchanged ideas of how
to sabotage the show until 5 the next morning.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had been joking for some time that we wished we could
'banish' the producers,'' recalls Hoese. ``Then, the option of the
houseguests leaving all together was raised. We in Internet land
were galvanized and cheering this subversion on, when it was
abruptly ended by the suggestion of pancakes. The houseguests
drifted away from the idea, but we seized on it, and after a short
period of smart-ass talk about revolution and breakfast foods, flew
our first banner.''
</P>
<P>
   Others began flying banners over the house, and Hoese and Oswald
created a Web site mediajammers.org that details its grievances
with ``BB,'' including serious allegations that in manipulating the
show's reality, the producers are breaking laws that were set in
place after the quiz-show scandals of the 1950s.
</P>
<P>
   Curiously, the houseguests' attitudes toward the banners have
ranged from confusion to contempt, while they openly called for
Mallory.
</P>
<P>
   ``Ms. Megaphone was able to be almost immediately responsive to
the houseguests,'' Hoese notes. ``They felt like they were
interacting with her, whereas the banners felt more like criticism
and made them defensive. It's interesting, though, that once we
flew a banner explaining CBS had chased Ms. Meg off, the
houseguests stopped asking for her. It's a sign of how anxious they
are to please the show's powers-that-be. They're terrified that
they're being negatively portrayed, so they try to avoid doing
anything they think might result in retaliation.''
</P>
<P>
   Nonetheless, the effects of Media Jammers and the Megaphone Lady
contributed to what could have been great television, had CBS been
clever enough to understand that, and what will probably be
processed by more clever producers in the future.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's an amazing thing that people have had such an impact on
the show,'' says Mallory. ``If I were CBS, I'd glom onto the
outside 'interference' and capitalize on the publicity. Publicity
means that people are paying attention! I just don't think that CBS
gets that about this show. It's a new type of genre, so there have
to be new rules.'' &QL;

CONGRESS WEIGHS LIMITING STATE FOOD-SAFETY MEASURES 
</HEADLINE>
  
(ATTN: Calif.)  By   MARIAN BURROS   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Before Congress adjourns next month it may vote on a bill that
would prohibit state and local governments from passing food safety
laws that are tougher than federal laws. The food industry has
tried since 1986 to persuade Congress to pass this legislation, and
this year it may succeed through legislative maneuvering.
</P>
<P>
   The industry wants federal and local laws to be uniform because,
it says, conflicting laws confuse consumers. Yet 16 state attorneys
general who oppose the bill insist, with other opponents, that the
regulation of health and safety has historically been left up to
the states.
</P>
<P>
   The proposed legislation, called the national uniformity for
food bill, would void laws like a New Jersey prohibition on the
sale of the herbal supplement ephedra to anyone under 17. About a
dozen other states and local jurisdictions also have laws governing
the sale of ephedra, a stimulant that the Food and Drug and
Administration says has been responsible for at least 17 deaths,
many among young people.
</P>
<P>
   As a result of pressure from the dietary supplement industry,
the federal government has no law banning the sale of ephedra to
young people. In fact, the federal government barely regulates
dietary supplements. In July the General Accounting Office, the
investigative arm of Congress, said consumers may be buying
potentially unsafe ingredients because the Food and Drug
Administration has never issued safety standards for dietary
supplements. A law passed by Congress in 1994 prevents it from
doing so.
</P>
<P>
   If the current bill is passed it would also pre-empt states from
passing any other food safety measures under consideration, like
requiring the labeling of genetically modified foods, because the
federal government does not believe such labeling is necessary. The
recall last week of Kraft Taco Bell taco shells made with
genetically modified corn not approved for human consumption has
heightened interest in such labeling.
</P>
<P>
   Opponents of the new legislation say it would also void a New
York state law requiring that frozen food that has previously been
offered as fresh be so labeled, as well as other local laws
requiring warnings about the safe storage of eggs in the shell and
the proper handling of smoked fish and raw shellfish. Proponents
say that warning labels on raw shellfish would be exempt, but the
bill's wording is unclear. The bill would allow states to petition
the Food and Drug Administration to allow exemptions.
</P>
<P>
   Most important, the bill would void California's Proposition 65,
passed in 1986, which requires warning labels on products
containing ingredients that may cause cancer or birth defects. In
two instances companies chose not to sell foods in California
because they would have had to carry warnings. Proposition 65 was
instrumental in forcing manufacturers to change their products to
avoid the labels: taking lead-soldered food cans off the market,
for example, as well as removing lead in dishware and drastically
reducing the amount of lead in calcium supplements and antacids.
</P>
<P>
   The Grocery Manufacturers Association, which is leading the
fight for the new bill, acknowledged that Proposition 65 had not
resulted in label changes for any food sold in California. But
Brian Folkerts, vice president of government affairs for the
National Food Processors Association, said that ``if one state
imposed a warning requirement not adopted by other states, there is
pretty clear linkage that could lead to considerable confusion.''
Consumers might question the safety of certain products, Folkerts
said.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to the 16 state attorneys general (including those
of New York and Connecticut, but not of New Jersey), others
strongly opposed to this legislation include the Association of
Food and Drug Officials, made up of state and federal officials;
the Consumer Federation of America; and the Center for Science in
the Public Interest.
</P>
<P>
   Similar bills had never been voted out of committee before, but
this year's was approved by the Senate Agriculture Committee
without any hearings. Sen. Barbara Boxer, D-Calif., has blocked it
from a vote by the full Senate, but its sponsors are trying to
attach it as a rider to an appropriations bill, and it could pass
unnoticed in the last weeks of Congress, when so much legislation
is pushed through.
</P>
<P>
   David Roe, a senior attorney for the Environmental Defense Fund,
describes the efforts to attach the bill as a rider as ``a nasty
little sneak attack.'' The bill's sponsors, he said, ``managed to
get it through without one single hearing.'' He contends that ``it
would muzzle all the states in advance forever.''
</P>
<P>
   The Food and Drug Administration acknowledges that it does not
have the ability to deal with all food safety issues, but it has
not taken a position on the bill.

 &HT;    PEGASUS SOARS IN OCTOBER SKIES(a) 
 &HT;    (Duplication warning: in ``A'' and ``L'' categories)

<TEXT>
<P>
   Pegasus, the flying horse of Greek mythology, is well-placed for
evening viewing as it soars through the skies of October.
</P>
<P>
   The legends say Pegasus was created by Poseidon, the god of the
sea, from sand and sea and the blood of Medusa, the snake-haired
monster slain by Perseus. The arrogant hero Bellerophon tried to
ride Pegasus up to Mount Olympus, but Zeus intervened and sent him
crashing down to earth. Pegasus arrived riderless on Olympus and
stayed to fetch Zeus his lightning and thunderbolts.
</P>
<P>
   The Great Square of Pegasus, one of the most prominent patterns
in the sky, is easy to find in October. Just face south and look
high overhead three or four hours after sunset. Though the corners
of the square are not overwhelmingly bright, they are easy enough
to pick out.
</P>
<P>
   Only three of the four stars that mark the corners of the great
square actually belong to Pegasus. Alpheratz, in the northeast
corner, is a part of the constellation Andromeda.
</P>
<P>
   The great square is a good marker of celestial longitude, called
right ascension by astronomers. The east side of the square lies
very nearly on the 0 hour mark, the west side on the 23 hour mark.
And the stars of the west side point the way to the bright star
Fomalhaut in the south, the brightest member of the constellation
Piscis Austrinus.
</P>
<P>
   In the southwest corner of the square is Markab (''the
saddle''), the brightest star of Pegasus, a little more than 100
light-years away. Scheat, the northwest corner, is a huge, red
variable star, about 150 times bigger than our sun. More than 200
light-years distant, Scheat slowly and irregularly changes its
brightness.
</P>
<P>
   The southeast corner of the square, Algenib, is also a giant
star, about 570 light-years away.
</P>
<P>
   Enif, from the Arabic (beginitalic)Al-Anf(enditalic), ``the
nose,'' is about 780 light-years away, and is a handy guidepost to
one of the finest globular clusters in the sky. M15, about 4
degrees northwest of Enif, is a ball of hundreds of thousands of
stars 35,000 to 40,000 light-years away. Through binoculars it is a
small, faint patch of light, easily overlooked. But even a small
telescope reveals its true nature. Astronomers calculate that M15
is about 130 light-years in diameter.
</P>
<P>
   Another interesting object can be found about 4 and  &QC;  degrees
north of Eta Pegasi, and just slightly west of it. NGC7331 is a
spiral galaxy about 50 million light-years away. It's faint, but
you can make out its oval shape with backyard telescopes.
Long-exposure photographs display its true splendor, however. The
beautiful spiral arms and dark dust lanes that wrap around
NGC7331's central core give us a good idea of what our own Milky
Way galaxy would look like if we could view it from the depths of
intergalactic space.
</P>
<P>
   ELSEWHERE IN THE SKY ------
</P>
<P>
   Closer to home, Jupiter and Saturn rise early enough in October
to be observed in the east by late evening, but best views are
still during the wee hours of the morning. The planets, high
overhead before sunrise, form a distinctive triangle with the
bright star Aldebaran.
</P>
<P>
   Though Mars rises a couple of hours before the sun, it is so dim
it's not easily seen.
</P>
<P>
   After sunset on Oct. 29, take a look at the crescent moon, just
to the right of Venus, in the western sky. By next evening the moon
has slipped to the left of Venus.

   ``CHERRY''
</P>
<P>
   By Mary Karr
</P>
<P>
   (Viking, $24.95)
</P>
<P>
   ``I am not very successful as a little girl,'' Karr wrote in her
diary when she was 11. ``When I grow up, I will probably be a
mess.'' But look at the stories she has to tell. This sequel to her
acclaimed 1995 memoir, (beginitalic)The Liars' Club(enditalic),
takes her from a scrappy adolescent to a bored and rebellious
teenager about to leave for California with a truck full of boys,
her ticket out of the dreary Texas refinery town that had held her
captive for so long. Though she tries to make us think otherwise,
Karr's life in this book has an air of stability. Both parents are
finally under one roof for good (Karr's mother was married seven
times, twice to Mary's father), and her adolescent longings are not
so different from those of a thousand other girls. But if it's less
harrowing than (beginitalic)The Liars' Club(enditalic), its appeal
is the same: Karr is a born storyteller. Mary's voice is funny,
irreverent, profane, defiant and irresistible. And just think.
She's in her 40s. There might be more memoirs to come.

   He called her things like ``Nancy Pants'' and ``Nancy Poo'' and
``First Mommie'' in his letters, and they are so guileless and
unabashedly adoring that it seems almost voyeuristic to read them.
Over the years she kept them in a shopping bag, of all things, and
when Alzheimer's disease began to destroy his memory and his
ability to write anything at all, she took the letters out and
found solace in them. Now Nancy Reagan has written a biography of
her marriage and sprinkled it with her husband's letters. Many are
reproduced as he wrote them, some on White House stationary. The
book ends with a photograph of the couple on his birthday in
February, and with her thoughts on seeing her husband through this
last, difficult chapter of his life. Alzheimer's is truly a long
goodbye, she writes, ``but it's the living out of love.'' Royalties
will go to the Alzheimer's Foundation and to the Ronald Reagan
Library and Museum. To read a letter from the book, log on to azcen

   ``I don't have a title yet, or even a subject,'' a young man
tells his publisher. ``All I have is the price: twenty-three
ninety-five in hardcover.'' An agent gives his happy client the
news that ``Oprah is definite, Barnes and Noble is giving you front
windows, and Norman Mailer has agreed to a feud.'' A wife reminds
her husband that ``you may very well be from Mars, but the children
and I are from Westchester.'' And Charles Dickens squirms as an
editor waves the first page of his manuscript and says, ``I wish
you would make up your mind, Mr. Dickens. Was it the best of times
or was it the worst of times? It could scarcely have been both.''
We are cursed with the task of describing this book without benefit
of the drawings, so we'll cut to the chase: It's great fun. Our

   ``KANGAROO DREAMING''
</P>
<P>
   By Edward Kanze
</P>
<P>
   (Sierra Club, $25)
</P>
<P>
   This was their plan: They would have no plan. Inspired by the
writings of Ralph Waldo Emerson (''The health of the eye seems to
demand a horizon.'') to dump their dreary office jobs and travel
unfettered, and drawn to Australia by Kanze's recurrent dream about
kangaroos, they pulled up stakes and followed their noses. Kanze
and his wife were naturalists. Setting out to make the acquaintance
of Australia's wildlife, they met up with monitor lizards, snakes,
crocodiles and quicksand, as well as some friendlier natural
wonders. They spent nine months driving around the country. That's
a lot of Australia for readers to absorb, but our appetite for it
is big right now. And Kanze? He overplays his role as a latter-day
Odysseus, but there's something engaging about a man who deplanes
in Melbourne and says to his wife, ``We're not in Kansas anymore.''
And what do you know, he's still dreaming about kangaroos.

` BROTHER ' : KEEPING CODE OF HONOR, ON 2 CONTINENTS
</HEADLINE>
   (Eds.: Production notes are at end of review.) 
 By ELVIS MITCHELL   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ It's probably fitting that Takeshi Kitano goes by the
nickname Aniki in his yakuza spectacular ``Brother'' because he
stirs up some serious anarchy on the Los Angeles crime scene.
Kitano directed, edited and wrote ``Brother'' (aniki is Japanese
for brother), and his style of close-to-the-vest brutality travels
extremely well.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps it's because he's sharp enough to use the two settings
of the picture _ Los Angeles and Tokyo _ for their physical and
spiritual connotations. Los Angeles is wide open spaces. Tokyo is
dense and intimate, with gangsters seemingly nose to nose. (The
orchestral jazz score by Joe Hisaishi, has the roomy lilt of the
compositions by Maria Schneider; it's lovely and powerful.) And
Tokyo is where Yamamoto (Kitano) is far more demonstrative and
angry than he is when he's in America.
</P>
<P>
   The mournful Kitano, who goes by the sobriquet Beat Takeshi,
actually looks more like that nickname than ever; he's exhausted by
the burden of keeping the code of honor in the underworld on two
different continents. It's the way that screen icons age to become
more vivid versions of themselves, and Kitano's evolution has
demanded that he reduce himself even more, given that he's
channeling Clint Eastwood through Toshiro Mifune with a little bit
of Buster Keaton thrown in to keep the mix from crashing under its
own ponderous weight.
</P>
<P>
   At this rate, one wonders if Kitano will even bother to open his
eyes in his next movie (though in films directed by others, he
doesn't rely chiefly on the tortured minimalism). By this time, his
right cheek jumps like Michigan J. Frog, a twitch that shows the
strain in containing his own sad implacability while mayhem goes on
about him. (He's often the cause of the mayhem.) Kitano walks with
his head down slightly; it's not a retiring gait, but rather a
guarded one that says if you're looking for trouble, you've come to
the right place.
</P>
<P>
   Aniki ends up in the United States, fleeing waves of trouble
left in his wake in Japan, where the murder of his boss has caused
a gang war. Packing up his steamer trunk of black Yohji Yamamoto
wool crepe suits and silk work shirts _ which make him look like
the world's most malevolent agent _ he transplants himself to Los
Angeles, where his half-brother Ken (Claude Maki) is a small-time
drug dealer who runs with a crew of lowlifes who seem to be even
worse at a criminal lifestyle than he is.
</P>
<P>
   Soon, Aniki has raised the roof on Ken's drug business _
eliminating the competition with breathtaking cruelty _ and has
shown his younger sibling that, yes, loosely translated, ``yakuza''
means gangsta. Aniki and his new world pickup crew are dropping
some old world vengeance on any pack of criminals in their way and
setting into motion the kind of forces that will demand addressing.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the violence in his films, Kitano is a rigid moralist,
and a karmic retribution usually takes place in most of his work.
That Zen-like attention to the cosmic scales can feel a little
monotonous and too heavily worked out _ a Post-It carved in stone.
Though this is territory that Kitano has covered before, he
underlines the differences between Japan and the United States to
make dramatic points and give his solemn toughness a context. And
at the oddest times, a noise somewhere between a chortle and giggle
escapes from his lips and a twinkle dances in his manly squint.
</P>
<P>
   He lightens up as he becomes closer to Ken and like a brother to
Ken's mates, and gets very close to Denny (Omar Epps). Their bond
becomes a source of humor, given the unusual way they met. When
Kato (Susumu Terajima) goes to Los Angeles to join Aniki, the
``family'' is complete and he takes to dressing them in Yohji
finery as well. Unfortunately, they get the kind with contrasting
lapel highlights that make them look like part of a Color Me Badd
reunion tour.
</P>
<P>
   Kitano often plays around with the theme of the only man left on
earth with a shred of integrity _ a Gary Cooper who shoots first _
and in ``Brother'' he's so distanced that he barely speaks; he has
no dialogue in the first five minutes of the film. That's probably
because much of the movie takes place in English, a language he's
obviously uncomfortable with. The American actors are left, it
seems, to improvise their own dialogue around the framework Kitano
gave them.
</P>
<P>
   This works well more often than not. The scenes between Kato and
Jay (Royale Watkins), who develop a competitive and squabbling
relationship, have a goofy warmth. The basketball scenes are
especially good, although there are other times when the actors
stand around, unsure of what to do.
</P>
<P>
   Kitano's scenes with Epps have an intriguing give-and-take, with
the exception of an extended last scene that is all too clearly _
and badly _ improvised by Epps alone. If the film had ended a
couple of scenes earlier, on a touch that's a tribute to Westerns
and showdowns, Kitano would have finished things off beautifully.
But that's a minor quibble.  &QL;

   NATIONAL FORECAST
</P>
<P>
   An exceptionally dry weather pattern will develop across most of
the nation for the next few days. High pressure moving southeast
from central Canada will keep most of the East unusually cool, with
areas of early morning frost. Meanwhile, a warming trend will occur
in much of the West.
</P>
<P>
   Warmer air will temporarily reach the Northeast Wednesday as
sunshine and breezes from the southwest prevail ahead of a cold
front. The front will produce clouds and a few light showers from
extreme northern New England to the eastern Great Lakes Wednesday
afternoon. Cooler air will spread over the Northeast Wednesday
night in the wake of the front.
</P>
<P>
   Sunshine will be plentiful over a large area from the West
through the Plains to the Southeast. Clouds and a few showers will
occur in the mountains of Arizona and New Mexico.
</P>
<P>
   FOCUS: FIRST FROST
</P>
<P>
   During the next few mornings, the first frosts of the fall
season will occur in many areas of the upper Middle West and
Northeast. However, local effects will make some spots more prone
to freezing temperatures than others. Large bodies of water, which
act as reservoirs of warmth, protect nearby locations from chill.
Heat generated by human activities in cities helps stave off early
frost. In some metropolitan areas, the first frost in the suburbs
is up to 30 days earlier than in the city. Also, on calm nights in
rolling terrain, the cold, dense air drains toward the low spots
keeping nearby ridge tops warmer.

   PODOLSK, Russia _ Forget Marat Safin.
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. Open tennis champion from Russia may yet prove a flash
in the pan. Forget, too, president and judo expert Vladimir Putin.
Smirking about last month's sinking of the nuclear submarine Kursk
with 118 sailors aboard during a recent CNN interview isn't likely
to improve his stature.
</P>
<P>
   No, for a country desperate to restore its former greatness and
grasping for a unifying symbol, Olympic wrestler Aleksandr Karelin
_ a.k.a. ``The Experiment'' _ is the closest thing Russia has to a
national hero.
</P>
<P>
   Entering Wednesday's medal round at the Sydney Olympics, the
32-year-old Karelin boasts one of the most astounding records in
international sports competition: 12 European championships, nine
world championships and three Olympic gold medals. The 285-pound,
6-foot-four-inch superheavyweight from Siberia has not lost a match
since 1987.
</P>
<P>
   He is the unquestioned favorite to win in the 130-kilogram
(286-pound) superheavyweight division, as he always is.
</P>
<P>
   With roots still deep in rural Russia, Karelin provides a rare
glimmer of pride in a nation that even now, almost 10 years after
the fall of communism, can't agree on words for its national anthem
and whose economy barely outranks Belgium's.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's a bear. He's unbeatable. And he's ours,'' says Anatoly
Manedov, a 55-year-old cab driver in Moscow.
</P>
<P>
   Probably no one's shoulders are broad enough to bear the burden
of Russia's pent-up aspirations. Yet Karelin, whose boyhood
ambition was to become a truck driver like his father, may come as
close as anyone.
</P>
<P>
   Start with his physique. No, chuckled Karelin during a recent
pre-Olympic tournament south of Moscow, he wasn't created in a mad
scientist's laboratory. Still, the tax policeman and member of
Russian Parliament easily could be mistaken for a menacing giant.
</P>
<P>
   His cauliflowered ears flair from his shaven head like bent
wings. His jutting brow topples into eye sockets hollowed by months
of three-a-day practices. His face, like a battered catcher's mitt,
is furrowed by years of encounters with flying elbows, gouging
fingers and the polyurethane wrestling mat.
</P>
<P>
   Yet what's remarkable about Karelin is not his shoulders that
slope like the sides of a mountain or his chest that spreads like a
river delta. It's his hulking hands, which resemble in thickness
and length the steel claws of an earth-mover. With those hands, he
once lifted a refrigerator twice his size and carried it up eight
floors to his apartment. Human opponents fare worse.
</P>
<P>
   ``I grew up in Wyoming and wrestled with cows. When Karelin
grabs you, it's kind of the same thing,'' says Rulon Gardner, the
U.S. Olympic team's superheavyweight and a top challenger for the
gold medal. ``He basically grabs you the way he wants.''
</P>
<P>
   Upper-body strength is key in Greco-Roman wrestling, which bars
moves below the waist, and Karelin sports a trademark move that
matches his power with the nimbleness of a far lighter wrestler.
Benignly called the ``reverse body lift,'' it is anything but
friendly: He grips his arms around the waist of his 286-plus pound
opponent, hoists him off the ground and hurls him over his head.
</P>
<P>
   Karelin is not the move's only practitioner, but in a weight
class where fat is usually a friend and girth no enemy, he's
unique. ``It's a beautiful move,'' says Karelin, who likens a
wrestling match to a four-line couplet of poetry.
</P>
<P>
   Not surprisingly, the move's beauty _ much less the rhyme _ are
lost on Karelin's foes. Alexey Kolesnikov, the No. 3
superheavyweight on the Russian team who has sparred with Karelin
in practice for eight years, says every bout with Karelin ``is like
the last.''
</P>
<P>
   ``They prefer to be pinned rather than wrestle him. I've seen
the fear in their eyes many times,'' says Anatoly Nazarenko, an
assistant U.S. Olympic team coach and a former Olympian and
three-time world champion from Kazakhstan.
</P>
<P>
   The fear is well-founded. Indeed, Karelin's finest moment on the
mat may have come when he wasn't even at full strength. After
rupturing a chest muscle, he won the gold medal at the '96 games in
Atlanta wrestling largely with one arm.
</P>
<P>
   Even referees are awed.
</P>
<P>
   Asked what advice he received from his colleagues before
officiating a Karelin match, Kevin Maxwell of Utica, N.Y., sounded
less like a referee than an air-traffic controller: ``Just stand
back and get out of the way.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Comic book stuff,'' huffs Karelin when the subject of his
fear-stricken opponents comes up. He dismisses as fluff the
suggestion he's a shoo-in to win the gold medal.
</P>
<P>
   ``My opponents are obviously very generous to me with their
predictions, but they're totally different on the mat. They are not
at all peaceful there.''
</P>
<P>
   Karelin wears his celebrity like a badly-fitted suit. He insists
he has done nothing extraordinary, shies away from adoring fans and
said he struggles not to get ``blown up like a balloon with pride''
_ self-effacing statements that only enhance his popularity
further.
</P>
<P>
   Part of Karelin's aura here stems from his enduring ties to
Siberia, not usually included in Top-10 lists of the world's garden
spots. While many Russian sports stars now live abroad _ Anna
Kournikova in Florida, Safin in Spain and swimmer Alexander Popov
in Australia _ Karelin still lives with his wife and three children
in his hometown Novosibirsk, where his upbringing was by all
accounts Lincolnesque: besides being the son of a truck driver, he
grew up chopping firewood and fetching water from an outdoor well.
</P>
<P>
   ``Karelin is humble, not like those other superstars. That makes
him unique,'' says Manedov, the cab driver.
</P>
<P>
   (EDs: Story can end here. Optional add follows.)
</P>
<P>
   Russian politics still lags behind the media slickness of its
Western counterparts, but it wasn't difficult to see Karelin was a
political consultant's dream. Putin's Unity party, needing a boost
in the polls in the run-up to last year's parliamentary elections,
recruited him to run on its slate. He and Unity won handily.
</P>
<P>
   Viktor Kuznetsov, Karelin's longtime coach, denies the wrestler
had any interest in politics before the high-level Kremlin
officials came knocking on his door.
</P>
<P>
   ``He never chased it but he couldn't refuse the offer. They just
used his name,'' says Kuznetsov, who refused to identify the
officials.
</P>
<P>
   For all his professed distaste of the limelight, Karelin has
profited from it. The vaunted Soviet sports machine, like so much
other infrastructure in Russia since communism's collapse in 1991,
is a rusty wreck that can no longer shower athletes with perks. Yet
Karelin is by all accounts well-off financially. His image adorns
fruit-juice packages, billboards and T-shirts.
</P>
<P>
   And one vestige of the machine remains: government bonuses.
While U.S. sportswear manufacturer Reebok is the Russian Olympic
team's sponsor, Putin has promised the team's athletes US$50,000
for a gold medal, US$20,000 for a silver and US$10,000 for a
bronze.
</P>
<P>
   Karelin laughs off rumors of presidential ambitions after, as
expected, his Olympic career ends in Sydney with another gold
medal. But with more success will no doubt come pressure to take on
the mantle of the Russia's frustrated dreams.
</P>
<P>
   It's not coincidental that the Russian media's latest nickname
for Karelin is the pet name of both of his political party and the
West's symbol for the once-feared Soviet Union: ``The Bear.''

`BEST IN SHOW': DOG OWNER EAT DOG OWNER KIND OF WORLD 
</HEADLINE>
  (Production notes at end of review) 
 By STEPHEN HOLDEN    
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   If you thought yuppie arrogance and entitlement had been
satirized to death, you haven't met Hamilton and Meg Swan (Michael
Hitchcock and Parker Posey), the hysterically doting dog owners who
have the funniest scenes in Christopher Guest's dog-show
mockumentary, ``Best in Show.'' When we first meet these monsters,
both lawyers from Illinois who cooingly recall first locking eyes
from behind the windows of adjacent Starbucks coffee shops, they
are in the middle of a tense therapy session.
</P>
<P>
   After they complain to the therapist that their child's jealousy
has ruined their sex life, the camera pulls away to reveal the
offending brat, none other than their moody, overprivileged pooch,
Beatrice, a pure-bred Weimaraner. Sprawled languorously on a couch,
wearing an expression of utter disdain, Beatrice momentarily turns
her head toward the camera, then looks away in abject disgust.
</P>
<P>
   As we quickly discover, the Swans are the sort of pet owners who
throw tantrums and threaten lawsuits in airports when someone
stoops to pet their precious but extremely hostile animal. They
also scream at the help in stores that don't happen to carry exact
replicas of their little darling's favorite squeaky toy. And when
these rage-oholics have no one left to terrorize, they savagely
turn on each other. Before the movie is over, Beatrice aggressively
asserts her independence at the Mayflower Kennel Club Dog Show, the
canine pageant that draws the film's major characters and their
prized pets to Philadelphia. It is a most satisfying comeuppance.
</P>
<P>
   ``Best in Show'' reunites many of the same brilliant comic
actors who appeared in Guest's last movie, the cult comedy classic
``Waiting for Guffman.'' In its hip, condescending way, the new
movie is every bit as funny as the earlier film, which painted an
amusing but patronizing portrait of a Missouri town staging a tacky
historical pageant with Broadway pretensions. As before, the actors
improvising from a bare-bones screenplay (by Guest and Eugene Levy)
riff off one another like jazz musicians to create what may be the
cleverest on-the-spot caricatures since the heyday of Mike Nichols
and Elaine May.
</P>
<P>
   The Swans are nearly matched in nasty hilarity by Gerry and
Cookie Fleck (Levy and Catherine O'Hara), a milquetoasty men's wear
salesman who was literally born with two left feet, and his
hotblooded wife, a woman with a checkered past. At every turn, the
Flecks keep running into Cookie's ex-lovers, none of whom she
recalls but who to Gerry's excruciating chagrin remember her all
too well and excitedly begin recalling their encounters in clinical
detail. Arriving in Philadelphia with their Norwich terrier Winky,
Gerry and Cookie, who have driven all the way from Fern City, Fla.,
discover at the hotel desk that their credit cards are invalid and
are ceremoniously ushered to a utility closet.
</P>
<P>
   From New York City come Scott Donlan (John Michael Higgins), a
flouncing gay dog breeder with a sartorial weakness for ruffles,
and his more sedate older partner, Stefan Vanderhoof (Michael
McKean), with their prized Shih Tzu, Agnes (after Agnes Moorhead).
Next, in descending order of humor, are Leslie Ward Cabot (Patrick
Cranshaw), a doddering-unto-death millionaire and his buxom trophy
wife (Sherri Ann Cabot), and Christy Cummings (Jane Lynch), the
upwardly mobile lesbian trainer of the May-December couple's
standard poodle, Rhapsody in White.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, we have Harlan Pepper (Guest), the owner of a
fly-fishing shop in Pine Nut, N.C., and his beloved bloodhound,
Hubert. Harlan is an aspiring ventriloquist who, when not
practicing with a dummy, gets into the heads of his dogs and starts
talking for them. The role is a huge and successful stretch for
Guest, whose last screen character, Corky St. Clair, a gushy,
petulant small-town theater director (and exile from Off Off
Broadway) supplied ``Waiting for Guffman's'' biggest laughs.
</P>
<P>
   Although Guest's brand of comedy has been called ``deadpan,'' it
was only the first of his three movies, the rock spoof ``This Is
Spinal Tap,'' that kept its tongue firmly in its cheek. ``Best in
Show,'' like ``Waiting for Guffman,'' is a subtly smirking gallery
of caricatures, most of whom don't seem to belong to a particular
region or class.
</P>
<P>
   The humor of Guest and his cast emanates from the
post-collegiate baby boomer belief in an elite ``hipoisie'' who,
unlike everyone else, know what's cool and what's not. And dog show
habitues, small-town Midwestern chamber of commerce boosters and
even successful second-level rock groups are definitely not cool.
</P>
<P>
   The movie's weaknesses are inextricable from its form. For
``Best in Show'' is essentially a well-organized, exquisitely
nuanced skit comedy, ``Saturday Night Live''-style sketches loosely
stitched together and refined to the Nth degree. Although the movie
pretends to have narrative structure, it doesn't really go much of
anywhere. It is futile to look for deeper patterns in this kind of
storytelling. The whole point is to savor the moments. This comic
jigsaw puzzle is crammed with deliriously funny little bits.
</P>
<P>
   My favorite joke is the running commentary by two antagonistic
television announcers, a reserved, erudite Englishman named Trevor
Beckwith (Jim Piddock) who is well versed in dog show protocol and
his loutish know-nothing partner, Buck Laughlin (Fred Willard), who
finds a smutty innuendo in every dog-show maneuver. Buck reaches a
height of flailing yahooism in a garbled monologue that imagines
the Mayflower piloted by Christopher Columbus landing at Plymouth
Rock in 1492. Or something like that. When ``Best in Show'' focuses
on a character like Buck, its aim is deadly.
</P>
<P>
   Rating: ``Best in Show'' is rated PG-13 (Parents strongly
cautioned). The screenplay is loaded with off-color humor and
sexual innuendo.
</P>

&HT;     ACCUSED NAVY SPY TO GET GRAND JURY HEARING 
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     (ATTN: Ohio)

<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ A Navy sailor, accused of giving the Russians
secrets about the U.S. submarine fleet, is scheduled to go before a
judge Wednesday for the first time since his arrest nearly a year
ago.
</P>
<P>
   Petty Officer 1st Class Daniel King, an intelligence analyst who
is being held in the U.S. Marine Corps brig at Quantico, Va., faces
one count of espionage and two counts of improperly disclosing
classified information. He could receive the death penalty if
convicted.
</P>
<P>
   Wednesday's proceeding is called an ``Article 32'' hearing,
which is the equivalent of a grand jury in the civilian system.
Navy Cmdr. Roxie Merritt described the session as ``a pre-trial
hearing.'' Essentially, the court will determine whether the
evidence against King is strong enough to proceed to a trial. The
proceeding could last several weeks.
</P>
<P>
   King worked as a cryptography, or code, expert at the National
Security Agency at Fort Meade, Md. Investigators believe that King
gave the Russians a computer disk containing U.S. submarine data in
1994.
</P>
<P>
   An 18-year Navy veteran and a native of Elyria, Ohio, King was
arrested in the Washington, D.C., area by the Naval Criminal
Investigative Service last Oct. 28 and accused of espionage a week
later. He has been held in the Quantico brig ever since.
</P>
<P>
   Pentagon officials have said that King, 40, confessed to
espionage after failing a lie detector test.
</P>
<P>
   King's lawyers counter that he is innocent and that during his
interrogation, King referred to the confessions as ``dreams'' and
``fantasies.'' His lawyers also accuse the Navy of ``outrageous
misconduct'' by interrogating King for unusually long sessions of
19 hours or more.
</P>
<P>
   King only now is going before a judge because of a controversy
over how the Navy has handled the case.
</P>
<P>
   In March, Vice Adm. Joseph S. Mobley, commander of the U.S.
Atlantic Fleet's Naval Air Force, issued a highly unusual
protective order barring all contact between the defendant and his
lawyers unless a Navy security officer was present at the meetings.
The Navy said some of King's attorneys lacked high-security
clearance called ``special access,'' reserved for some of the
nation's most guarded secrets, higher than ``top secret.''
</P>
<P>
   King's lawyers objected, asserting that the order violated
attorney-client privilege.
</P>
<P>
   The National Institute of Military Justice, a private
organization that monitors military courts, agreed that the
security officer ``seemingly shatters the concept of
confidentiality and the attorney-client relationship along with it.
In our corporate experience and research, such an order is
completely without precedent.''
</P>
<P>
   Similarly, the National Association of Criminal Lawyers said
that the protective order ``raises grave and fundamental
constitutional concerns.''
</P>
<P>
   ``How is counsel to prepare for cross-examination, to know what
defense witnesses and evidence is available if they cannot
communicate with the accused with a certainty of privilege,'' the
group asked. The Navy has ``functionally barred the effective
assistance of counsel.''
</P>
<P>
   King's civilian defense lawyer, Jonathan Turley, a George
Washington University law professor, appealed to the military's
highest court, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Armed Forces, to
strike the protective order and won. But the order had the effect
of preventing King from meeting with his lawyers for nearly six
months, from March to August.
</P>
<P>
   In a statement, Turley's office said that King ``has now been
held for a period longer than the scientist Wen Ho Lee,'' the
Energy Department scientist accused of spying for China. Lee, who
was incarcerated for nine months though never tried, faced 59
felony charges accusing him of downloading nuclear secrets from
Energy Department computers. Lee was freed Sept. 13 after pleading
guilty to one felony count of mishandling weapons secrets.
</P>
<P>
   ``King, unlike Lee, however, has never been formally charged or
given an opportunity to appear before a trial judge to secure his
release,'' Turley's statement said.

<P>
   The campaign season often gives rise to dumb ideas. Weeks ago,
the FBI released statistics showing that youth and school violence
is at its lowest level in more than a decade. Yet, members of
Congress chose this month to blame the film and television
industries for rising teen violence.
</P>
<P>
   The message to Hollywood: Get rid of the violence on your own,
or we'll pass legislation that does it for you. The political
chorus was joined by Democratic candidate for president Al Gore,
his running mate, Joseph Lieberman, and Lynne Cheney, wife of
Republican vice presidential nominee Dick Cheney.
</P>
<P>
   Politicians don't believe that the American people can find the
off button on their television sets. They want the government to
make decisions about what adults and children will be allowed to
watch. Never mind parental decisions. Never mind the First
Amendment. The threat of congressional legislation is real. The
Senate Commerce Committee passed a bill on Sept. 20, that will ban
television shows containing graphic bloodshed or violence during
daylight hours when children might be watching _ from 6 a.m to 10
p.m. Presumably, news reports are excluded from the ban.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Ernest Hollings, D-S.C., who sponsored the bill, wants a
``safe harbor'' for children during the time when they watch
television. Hollings doesn't believe that the much heralded V-chip
technology, required by law in all new TV sets larger than 13
inches, has worked.
</P>
<P>
   The V-chip can be used by parents to block violent or sexual
material. But many parents don't want technology making choices for
them, so they don't use it. That should be a clue to Hollings. If
parents don't want a V-chip making judgments for them, they
certainly don't want the government doing it.
</P>
<P>
   This political attack on Hollywood has been fueled by a phony
report recently released by the Federal Trade Commission that
pretends to show that violence in the media causes teen violence in
the streets and schools. But even the FTC report did not claim that
violent programs and violent video games cause aggression. It
couldn't.
</P>
<P>
   The report hedged by noting statistical ``correlations'' between
violent media fare and teen violence. Correlations can indicate
some relationship between two different kinds of events _ or
correlations can indicate absolutely nothing. If one were to chart
birds singing before dawn with the rising of the sun, one would
find an almost perfect correlation. But to then suggest that bird
songs cause the sun to rise would be patently ridiculous. Yet the
correlation is unmistakably present.
</P>
<P>
   A correlation between the 100 best books in English and the 100
most frequently challenged books in the past decade, as compiled by
the American Library Association's Office of Intellectual Freedom,
would be very high. Perhaps someone could argue from the
correlation that the better a book is, the more likely it is to be
attacked.
</P>
<P>
   No credible scientific evidence exists that shows a
cause-and-effect relationship between watching violent programming
and aggressive behavior.
</P>
<P>
   But the politicians will beat their chests and act holier than
thou as they try to drum up votes. These same politicians, if they
are over 50 years old, were likely raised on the often frightening
fairy tales by Jacob and Wilhelm Grimm and sad tales like Hans
Christian Andersen's ``The Little Match Girl'' and ``The Steadfast
Tin Soldier.'' Few would claim such stories twisted the psyches of
those who read them.
</P>
<P>
   In the last decade, the Grimm Brothers' adaptation of ``Little
Red Riding Hood,'' by the way, was attacked by teachers and parents
in the United States for being too violent.
</P>
<P>
   This is also Banned Books Week _ the week that the American
Library Association set aside to celebrate our freedom to read.
It's an appropriate time to read a banned book, if you haven't
already in the past month.
</P>
<P>
   J.K. Rowling's Harry Potter series received the dubious honor of
being the most frequently challenged books in 1999. The attempts to
ban the series were based on charges that it encourages a belief in
the occult, wizardry and magic.
</P>
<P>
   The number of books that were targeted for banning last year,
according to the list compiled by the Office of Intellectual
Freedom, dropped to 472. Challenges to books have been dropping
steadily since 1995 and since the Internet has become a major focus
of censorship attempts.
</P>
<P>
   The majority of the attempts to ban books are reported by public
libraries, public schools and school libraries. And most challenges
to books are initiated by parents, library patrons and school
administrators.
</P>
<P>
   If you haven't read one of the books on the list of the American
Library Association's Ten Most Challenged Books of 1999, you
haven't been reading: John Steinbeck's ``Of Mice and Men'' is sixth
on the list; Maya Angelou's ``I Know Why the Caged Bird Sings`` is
seventh; Margaret Atwood's ``The Handmaid's Tale'' is eighth; Alice
Walker's ``The Color Purple'' is ninth; and in 10th place, David
Guterson's ``Snow Falling on Cedars.''
</P>
<P>
   These classics were challenged because some folks were offended
by the strong language and the realistic sexual scenes.
</P>
<P>
   It is somewhat comforting to know that ``Of Mice and Men'' still
shocks some readers. Books should shock us out of our complacency,
should make us uncomfortable with their truths. Shake us a little.
They should make us think, or even reevaluate our lives or issues.
</P>
<P>
   One finds Mark Twain's ``The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn''
high on the list of books most frequently challenged in the past
decade. Authors like J.D. Salinger, Maurice Sendak, Toni Morrison,
Harper Lee, Aldous Huxley, Kurt Vonnegut, Richard Wright, William
Golding and Isabel Allende have books on that list.
</P>
<P>
   Stumped for a good book to read during those winter months when
the snow is high against your door? Call your local library or
bookstore and ask what book has been banned recently, then go down
and get a copy. It's bound to be worth reading.

 &HT;    DISPATCHES FROM DREAMSVILLE: Chicken thieves outfox sheriff
 &HT;    (''Dispatches from Dreamsville'' is an occasional series in
which readers share with Cox Newspapers senior writer Joe Murray
their memories of growing up in small-town America. Back then, or
at least the way we remember it, life was like a dream.)
 &HT;    
 &HT;    By Dale Denney
 &HT;    c. 2000 Special to Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   The chicken thieves had hit again in our small community in the
middle of Oklahoma in the 1930s.
</P>
<P>
   And they left this poem:
</P>
<P>
   ``We steal from the rich, we steal from the poor. We leave you a
hen and rooster, to raise some more.''
</P>
<P>
   Everybody knew it was the Montrose brothers doing it, Elzie and
Alfred. Elzie was tall and skinny; Alfred, short and fat. Both were
red-headed.
</P>
<P>
   They always seemed to have money, keeping themselves supplied
with expensive Beech Nut chewing tobacco and paying cash for it.
</P>
<P>
   Nor were they chinchy about sharing. They generously passed the
package along to anybody who might be standing around.
</P>
<P>
   Most everybody liked Elzie and Alfred. Their daddy was a poor
sharecropper who housed his large family in a small, two-room
clapboard shack.
</P>
<P>
   Once in a while Elzie and Alfred would actually work, helping
their daddy on the farm, but mostly they slept late.
</P>
<P>
   At first people thought the poems were a good joke, but times
were hard and chickens were chickens _ meat for the table, eggs for
cooking and feathers for mattress ticking.
</P>
<P>
   The county sheriff was determined to catch Elzie and Alfred,
preferably in the act.
</P>
<P>
   He appointed a committee of the more prosperous farmers and made
a map of the area. Then they put the date the chickens were stolen
on all the hen houses.
</P>
<P>
   Thus, they came up with a pattern, and it was decided that the
Williams place would be the next chicken house hit.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'll teach them a thing or two about stealing chickens'' the
sheriff declared. ``I'll fix me a bed in the chicken house and have
my loaded shotgun handy. A good dose of bird shot in their behinds
will put an end to their chicken stealing.''
</P>
<P>
   The sheriff took the rear seat out of his car and hauled it to
the chicken house to use as a bed.
</P>
<P>
   But it was such a good bed that he went to sleep and didn't wake
up until sunrise when the old red rooster was crowing in his ear.
</P>
<P>
   The sheriff sat bolt upright and grabbed for his gun. But the
gun was gone.
</P>
<P>
   Pinned to his vest was a piece of paper with writing on it. He
ripped it off and read what it said:
</P>
<P>
   ``We steal from the rich, we steal from the poor. We came for
the chickens, but your shotgun is worth more.''
</P>
<P>
   And since it was worth more, it was almost a year before folks
lost anymore chickens.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the people thought swapping a county shotgun for a year
free of chicken thieves was a pretty darn good trade.

SON OF MICROWAVE: FAST AND CRISP 
</HEADLINE>
   By FLORENCE FABRICANT   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   It sounds impossible: an oven that can cook as fast as a
microwave but delivers the crisped, well-browned results of a
conventional oven.
</P>
<P>
   Yet, that is exactly the claim behind a new generation of ovens
now arriving on the market with considerable fanfare and the
endorsement of some top chefs.
</P>
<P>
   The makers of these ovens _ which combine microwave technology
with other heating systems _ boast that a rack of lamb will be done
in as little as 7 minutes, and a perfect crisp-skinned roast
chicken in only 20.
</P>
<P>
   Four companies are now manufacturing seven of the ovens, which
are engineered to cut cooking times by up to 80 percent through a
combination of conventional heating, convection blowers,
microwaves, broiling elements or even super-hot halogen or quartz
bulbs. The microwaves, which cook the interior of foods by
vibrating water molecules within them, also enhance the penetration
of other heating elements, which brown the surface.
</P>
<P>
   I tested three of the fastest ovens on the market:
</P>
<P>
   _ General Electric's Advantium, which was introduced early last
year and uses halogen light bulbs and microwaves.
</P>
<P>
   _ Maytag's Jenn-Air Accellis 5XP, which uses microwaves and
high-intensity convection heating.
</P>
<P>
   _ Thermador's CJ, which combines high-intensity convection
heating and microwaves.
</P>
<P>
   I prepared an array of foods in each of them, including rack of
lamb, roast chicken, salmon fillets, baked potatoes and lemon
poundcake. The results were often nothing short of amazing. In
fact, roast chicken and salmon were better in the Thermador CJ and
the Jenn-Air than in a conventional oven. Some foods, like rack of
lamb and poundcake, actually cooked more evenly in one oven, the
Advantium, than in either of the two others or a conventional oven.
</P>
<P>
   I'm not alone in my amazement.
</P>
<P>
   ``It blew my mind,'' said Dean Fearing, the chef at the Mansion
on Turtle Creek in Dallas, who recently tried Jenn-Air's Accellis
5XP wall oven as part of a television appearance. ``I was skeptical
until I saw it in action and it made the best chicken I ever had,
and in about 11 minutes.''
</P>
<P>
   Combination microwave and convection ovens have been around for
years, but rely on microwaves as the source of heat _ not
high-speed convection or halogen lamps. The new generation of
high-speed models bring to home cooks technology once available
only in professional kitchens.
</P>
<P>
   The manufacturers say these high-speed ovens, which start at
$1,300 and, for a two-oven unit, go to $5,200, succeed where
microwaves failed because of the combined technology. ``When the
microwave oven was introduced 30 or so years ago it was supposed to
be the savior,'' said Bill Deter, the vice president and general
manager for cooking products at Maytag. ``But it only had speed,
not the quality of the cooking. People were not willing to
compromise.''
</P>
<P>
   Other major manufacturers are moving into the technology as
well, including Whirlpool and KitchenAid.
</P>
<P>
   Deter said Maytag sees speed as the overriding concern for
consumers, which is why it is investing in this electric technology
even though 40 percent of all ovens in the United States run on
gas. ``People want dinner in half an hour,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The ovens also function as regular microwave ovens. The
Advantium can be used without preheating. All cook in a fifth to a
quarter of the time of a regular oven.
</P>
<P>
   But there are drawbacks. The ovens are quite small _ forget
about a 20-pound turkey. The Advantium must be used with a
turntable, like a microwave oven, which further limits the space
for food. As with regular microwave ovens, the number of items
being cooked can slow things down in the Jenn-Air and the
Advantium. Only the Thermador does not require microwave-safe glass
or ceramic cookware. Conventional metal baking sheets, cake tins
and casseroles cannot be used during speed cooking in the others,
which come with special broiling and crisping pans.
</P>
<P>
   All the ovens have control panels for entering details like the
type of cooking function (speed cooking, microwave or convection),
the kind of food to be cooked and, often, its size. As a result of
surveys of what people usually cook, the manufacturers have
programmed the time and temperature for many standard dishes, like
chicken, baked potatoes and brownies. But there can be problems
with a dish that has not been programmed, like poundcake in a loaf
pan. The user must consult a manual, find a similar dish and hope
for the best.
</P>
<P>
   Fortunately, the cooking can be interrupted to check the food.
With the Thermador CJ, once the food category has been selected,
only the conventional cooking time has to be entered; the oven
automatically converts it to the speed-cooking equivalent. The
Jenn-Air also provides automatic conversion, and it has a warning
beeper so the food can be checked shortly before the cooking cycle
ends, to help avoid overcooking. (A minute or two can make a big
difference.)
</P>
<P>
   With the Advantium, separate settings are needed for the upper
and lower heating elements and the microwave function. Recipes from
the manual are preprogrammed.
</P>
<P>
   I had the best overall results with the Jenn-Air and the
Thermador CJ. Ordinary three-pound supermarket chickens emerged
after 20 minutes with the skin beautifully crisped, yet with the
breast meat exceptionally juicy. Salmon fillets on a bed of leeks,
cooked in 3 minutes to an internal temperature of 120 degrees, or
medium rare, were excellent in these ovens. Even when the fish was
left in long enough to register about 140 degrees, as ovens were
programmed for, it was still delectably moist, especially in the
Jenn-Air.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Not everything turned out as good as the chicken and salmon. A
rack of lamb cooked in the Thermador CJ was perfectly done inside
but tasted more steamed than roasted, and its crumb and mustard
crust was not sufficiently browned. A souffle cooked in the same
oven was too rubbery. On the other hand, this oven did a great job
with beef short ribs braised in a covered metal casserole. And
baked potatoes turned out fine, while a poundcake was delicious,
browned, yet with perfect texture.
</P>
<P>
   With the Jenn-Air, timing a poundcake turned out to be somewhat
hit-or-miss, and the skin of baked potatoes remained soft. I did
not try the souffle or short ribs in this oven.
</P>
<P>
   For comparison's sake, I also tried the $1,300 Maytag 2X, a
free-standing range with a full-size oven, which combines
conventional cooking with microwaves, cutting normal cooking time
in half. Most of the food cooked somewhat unevenly and was a trifle
dry, especially the poundcake, the chicken and the salmon when it
was not medium-rare. Thermador also has a full-size, slower model,
the CM, which was not available for testing.
</P>
<P>
   As for the Advantium, though the crust on the rack of lamb was
underbrowned, the meat was excellent. This oven also did the best
job with baked potatoes, though they had to be turned once during
baking. The chicken and salmon were not as moist as in the other
ovens. The poundcake was a trifle dry; as with the Jenn-Air, the
timing was a guesstimate.
</P>
<P>
   In a well-equipped kitchen, the ovens would best be auxiliaries
to a full-size oven.
</P>
<P>
   The technology evolved from commercial equipment. For example,
the speed of the Jenn-Air oven depends on a concentrated forced-air
convection system that is similar to the one used in the company's
Blodgett line for restaurant kitchens, but not so powerful.
Developed by Turbo Chef, it can cook in a tenth of the time a
conventional oven takes. But at that speed it's too noisy for a
home kitchen. Deter said that in adapting the technology for home
use the company also added features like self-cleaning.
</P>
<P>
   The halogen system in the Advantium was first developed in the
early 1990s in California and used in pizza ovens. Called
Flashbake, it is still sold commercially but has also been licensed
to Vulcan-Hart, a manufacturer of professional equipment, and to
General Electric for residential use. Brad Blackburn, the vice
president of marketing for Vulcan-Hart, said that halogen bulbs
produce a broad spectrum of light, which both browns and penetrates
the food to heat it.
</P>
<P>
   This month, Whirlpool will introduce KitchenAid's Ultima Cook,
as well as a similar Whirlpool version. It had no demonstration
models available, so I was unable to test either. The company said
both ovens combine microwave, convection, broiling and quartz heat
but have slightly different designs. For many foods, there will be
special instructions, like one requiring that the cook dust a
chicken with flour and put it in a crisper bag.
</P>
<P>
   When microwave ovens first appeared, cooks were often in the
dark about how to use them. This time around, the oven companies
are lining up professional chefs to help promote and explain the
products. Jenn-Air has a contract with Charlie Trotter, and is
holding a cooking contest for chefs at the Culinary Institute of
America at Greystone in the Napa Valley next month. Thermador's
ovens have been in use at the French Culinary Institute in New
York.
</P>
<P>
   General Electric, which is advertising the Advantium heavily
during the Olympics, has arranged with Nestle to have Advantium
cooking instructions included with its line of Stouffer's Oven
Sensations frozen meals. ``The microwave oven finally took off when
appliance companies and food companies began to work together,''
Wood said. ``That's why we went with it right away.''
</P>
<P>
   The company has also hired Marcus Samuelsson of Aquavit, who
plans to use the oven in his new Scandinavia House restaurant,
where there will not be a full kitchen.
</P>
<P>
   I am not giving up on my regular oven just yet, but one of these
would be great to have. And I'd use it for more than just 20-minute
chicken.

<P>
   (UNDATED) The pharmaceutical industry's war against the state of
Maine is intensifying.
</P>
<P>
   In the wake of Maine's groundbreaking price-control legislation,
two more companies _ Bristol-Myers Squibb Co. and AstraZeneca Plc _
have shifted their distribution business out of state in the past
month. Until now, SmithKline Beecham Plc had been the only drug
maker known to have made such a move.
</P>
<P>
   The action underscores what is going to be a fierce and closely
watched battle. In mid-August Maine became the first state to
require drug makers to negotiate lower prices or face price
controls in 2003. The law allows the state to purchase medicines on
behalf of 325,000 residents who lack insurance coverage for
prescription drugs.
</P>
<P>
   Drug makers, which have endured intense criticism over their
pricing policies this election year, argue that price controls
would limit revenue and cap the profits that can be plowed back
into research and development. The industry raises the same point
in the national debate over competing proposals to provide a
prescription-drug benefit to Medicare recipients.
</P>
<P>
   ``We look at the law as having a detrimental impact,'' said Pat
Donohue, a Bristol-Myers spokesman. ``It discourages investment in
new medicines.''
</P>
<P>
   Rachel Bloom, an AstraZeneca spokeswoman, called the shift ``a
business decision.''
</P>
<P>
   Although Maine is mostly rural and sparsely populated, the
legislation may have national ramifications. The drug industry
fears other states will follow Maine's lead, particularly in New
England where residents have access to cheaper drugs in Canada.
Many senior citizens have fueled the controversy by taking bus
trips to Montreal and other points to buy medicine.
</P>
<P>
   Similar bills have been introduced in a number of states and
others are conducting hearings and studies, said Marjorie Powell,
assistant general counsel at the Pharmaceutical Research and
Manufacturers of America, an industry trade group that sued Maine
last month, saying the legislation is unconstitutional.
</P>
<P>
   ``Price controls aren't the answer,'' she said. ``We think they
don't work and will ultimately hurt patients.''
</P>
<P>
   Critics of the industry, however, charge that profits are too
high; that the cost of researching and developing new drugs is
overstated; and that a large amount of resources is actually spent
on advertising, influencing doctors' prescribing trends or lobbying
the federal government for patent extensions and other favorable
legislation.
</P>
<P>
   The issue is being debated across the nation and figures
prominently in the presidential campaign. But in the absence of
federal legislation, it's playing out, for now, in Maine, where
roughly one in four people lack some type of insurance for
prescription drugs.
</P>
<P>
   Many Maine legislators argue that the pharmaceutical industry
has employed scare tactics in the hopes of first defeating the
legislation and now turning popular support against the politicians
who forged it. Chellie Pingree, the Maine legislator who
spearheaded the law and has been touring the country touting its
provisions, accused the drug makers of scaring senior citizens into
thinking their drugs won't be available.
</P>
<P>
   ``We wrote this law anticipating some reluctance from the
pharmaceutical manufacturers. So I'm not surprised,'' she said.
``But I'm not pleased. It's really just a threat. And it's actually
kind of silly, because I don't think it will stop lawmakers from
proceeding with what we know is a good idea.''
</P>
<P>
   One reason the drug makers are shifting their distribution out
of state is to avoid a provision in Maine's new law. This requires
drug makers selling medicines in the state through any public
assistance program, such as Medicaid, to offer rebates to the
purchasing program created by the Maine law. By shifting their
distribution to facilities outside Maine, the drug makers are
hoping to avoid this provision.
</P>
<P>
   The drug makers, however, insist their products will remain
available in Maine, because they say medicines will now simply be
trucked from warehouses in nearby states. In each case, the
warehouses are owned by the same distributor, Bindley Western
Industries Inc. The manager of Bindley's Maine facility didn't
return telephone calls seeking comment, but a company official and
spokespeople for the drug makers confirmed the arrangement.
</P>
<P>
   The drug makers deny that the distribution shift will result in
higher prices. But one Maine legislator, Joe Bruno, who also owns
10 pharmacies in the state, said any additional shipping costs
would likely be borne by retailers. In some instances, he said,
this could result in higher prices.

`PERSIAN MIRRORS': FINDING THE SEEDS OF HOPE IN A SOCIETY OF
PARADOXES 
</HEADLINE>
   (Eds: Publication notes at end of review ;  Ira M. Lapidus,
professor emeritus at the University of California at Berkeley, is
the author of ``A History of Islamic Societies.'' ) 
 By IRA LAPIDUS   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   For many Americans, Iran conjures up the hostage crisis,
terrorism, the crowds chanting ``death to America'' and the fierce
Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini denouncing the United States and
Israel.
</P>
<P>
   Elaine Sciolino shows a different Iran. More than 20 years of
visits, interviews, encounters and analyses have given Sciolino, a
senior correspondent in the Washington bureau of The New York
Times, her deep and wide-ranging insights. Her perceptive book
``Persian Mirrors: The Elusive Face of Iran'' conveys the diversity
of Iranians and the subtleties, dilemmas and contradictions of
their society today.
</P>
<P>
   Iran is not easy to know well, but Sciolino knows it intimately.
Its people are warm and welcoming, but do not reveal themselves
readily. Conversation, she reports, is full of politeness,
self-abnegation, hypocrisy and lying, all to avoid offense and loss
of face. What happens can be accepted, but talking about it is
taboo if it strips away dignity and honor. Sciolino succeeds
because she has unraveled a difficult code of cultural
expectations.
</P>
<P>
   She is particularly sensitive to Iranian women. ``There is an
unspoken bond among us that transcends culture, history,
nationality and language,'' she writes. She shows both their
helplessness and their power. In public life Iran's women must not
be visible. Their heads and bodies must be covered. They may be
beaten for violations of these rules.
</P>
<P>
   In private and family matters, Islamic law puts them at a
disadvantage. Although it is easy for a man to obtain a divorce, a
woman can get one only in extreme circumstances, and the husband is
given custody of all but the youngest children. Husbands can also
take second wives or arrange ``temporary marriages,'' which are
religiously acceptable.
</P>
<P>
   Nonetheless, women fill almost all the roles of a modern
society. More than half of Iranian university students are women.
Women work, drive, own property, have access to birth control and
vote. Moreover, the book notes, women ``are experts in finding ways
around the constraints of the male-dominated system.'' Sciolino
found everything from gender-segregated parties to beauty salons to
a woman who ran a gambling business in her apartment, where women
in low-cut dresses drank and danced to heavy-metal music.
</P>
<P>
   This activity is very dangerous. There is always the possibility
of an unexpected intrusion by the morals police, perhaps just to
extort a bribe, perhaps to arrest the participants. The insecurity
is deeply resented.
</P>
<P>
   Women also show extraordinary courage in fighting the system.
Azam Taleghani, the publisher of the weekly newspaper Payam-e
Hajar, is committed to Islam and the revolution but challenges
clerical ideas of male supremacy and promotes a more feminist
interpretation of the Koran. Another activist, Faezeh Hashemi,
published a newspaper until it was banned and now promotes sports
programs to combat depression among women and to encourage them to
fight for their rights.
</P>
<P>
   Minorities do not fare well at all, but are nonetheless loyal to
the Iran of their ideals. Zoroastrians and Christians are barely
tolerated. Jews are accepted in business, medicine, engineering and
law, but anti-Semitism is widespread, and the government maintains
incessant anti-Israeli propaganda. Bahais are persecuted
relentlessly. Their marriages are not recognized by the state.
Their property has been confiscated. They have been expelled from
the universities and many have been executed.
</P>
<P>
   But even under this pressure, the religious minorities are
loyal. Jews _ Persian is their native language _ feel profoundly,
truly Iranian. And a Bahai engineer says: ``I am Iranian. I love
this country.''
</P>
<P>
   Courage and love are essential because the authorities are
powerful and oppressive. The clerical establishment, headed by the
supreme leader, now Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, controls the judiciary
and large sectors of the economy. A vast apparatus of military,
police, intelligence officers, morals enforcers and organized
vigilantes is used to crush drugs, gambling, homosexuality,
prostitution, rape, murder, spying, counter-revolutionary
activities and ``sowing corruption on earth.'' Above all, it
punishes women for being improperly dressed in public. Recently
Iranian journalists and students have been beaten and killed.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the authorities have not been able to check the demand
for a transformation of the Islamic Republic into an Islamic
democracy. There is a vigorous though embattled press. Guardedly,
young people, women and intellectuals, including many liberal
clerics, struggle for the future.
</P>
<P>
   Recent elections gave 70 percent of the seats in parliament to
liberals, but they are still paralyzed by the powers of the
conservatives, and it is not yet clear who will win. Although the
struggle is sometimes framed as a conflict between Persian and
Islamic identities, religion and popular culture, clerical rule and
freedom, dictatorship and democracy, in this supple and
sophisticated country even liberals accept the Islamic state.
Looking beneath the surface, Sciolino makes us aware of deeper
currents flowing toward political compromise and synthesis.
</P>
<P>
   Iranians, she points out, have a love-hate relationship with the
United States. In politics it is the Satan that opposed Iran in the
war with Iraq, shot down a civilian airliner, orchestrated an
embargo and sides with Israel. Yet America, avidly consumed on
television, audio and videocassettes and computer software, is the
country of Iranian dreams. It embodies their fantasies of a good
life. American relations with this fascinating nation hold
unanticipated possibilities.
</P>
<P>
   Through Sciolino's eyes, we see a culture of paradoxes: a nation
that is open and welcoming but remains hidden and mysterious; a
clerical dictatorship but one of the Middle East's liveliest
democracies; a puritanical regime but a people who love everyday
life; a severe orthodoxy but an expressive cinema and an
argumentative press; a state that makes control of women its first
concern but whose women are powerful as personalities and even
subversive; a revolution that has rejected secularism but a nation
heading toward a fusion of Islamic and Persian identities.
</P>
<P>
   First and foremost, Sciolino shows Iranians as human beings
trying to cope with an unusual and very difficult situation. For
this wise perspective the reader is grateful.

AMERICAN BASEBALLERS HEAD FOR GOLD-MEDAL GAME 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DAN SHAUGHNESSY  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   SYDNEY _ USA Baseball waited eight years for this opportunity.
Waiting a few more hours was no big deal.
</P>
<P>
   The rag-tag American baseball team will finally get to play a
gold-medal game against the Cubans Wednesday night. After eight
years of disappointment and frustration, the Yanks are where they
want to be _ playing one game for world supremacy against the Sons
of Fidel who act as if they invented our national pastime.
</P>
<P>
   Cuba won its medal-round game, beating Japan, 3-0, Tuesday
afternoon. The Americans played Korea in the nightcap and _ after
waiting through a two-hour rain delay _ won it, 3-2, on a
post-midnight, ninth-inning, walk-off homer by first baseman Doug
Mientkiewicz.
</P>
<P>
   Just a week earlier, Mientkiewicz hit an eighth-inning grand
slam to beat Korea. He called that the biggest homer of his life.
</P>
<P>
   Not now.
</P>
<P>
   ``They asked me if I had one more in me,'' said Mientkiewicz,
who played with the Minnesota Twins in 1999. ``I can't take much
more of this. But my country is playing for a gold medal now.''
</P>
<P>
   American manager Tommy Lasorda was his usual buoyant self. At
the postgame press conference early Wednesday, he unveiled a
patriotic stuffed creature that resembled an Uncle Sam snowman.
When Lasorda activated the toy, it played ``Stars and Stripes
Forever,'' and announced, ``America. Home of the free and the
brave. USA. No. 1!''
</P>
<P>
   ``We had it in the dugout all night,'' said the Hall of Fame
skipper. ``And we'll have it in the dugout tomorrow night. We know
we're the underdog. We're just a bunch of youngsters with not much
experience. But we're hoping just maybe we can turn it around.''
</P>
<P>
   Beating Korea assures the Yanks of at least a silver medal, but
it didn't come easily. After two weeks of perfect weather, Sydney's
spring roared back early this week and it was raining lightly when
the ubiquitous Dawn Fraser threw out the first ball.
</P>
<P>
   The Americans again had problems solving Korean submarineballer,
Chong Tae-hyon. Our lads looked like the Baltimore Orioles trying
to hit Kent Tekulve in the 1979 World Series. In the first week of
competition, Chong pitched seven shutout innings against the
Americans, only to watch Mientkiewicz's granny against Korean
reliever Park Seok-Jin in the bottom of the eighth.
</P>
<P>
   Chong was on his game again Tuesday. He held the Yanks hitless
in the first three innings and was staked to a 2-0 lead in the
third when American starter Roy Oswalt gave up a walk, a pair of
doubles, and a sac fly. Chong warmed up in front of his team's
dugout during the long inning.
</P>
<P>
   The US struck back in the bottom of the fourth when center
fielder Brad Wilkerson led with a double to right and scored on a
double to center by John Cotton.
</P>
<P>
   Ryan Franklin came on to pitch the seventh for the Americans and
he teamed with Todd Williams to shut down Korea the rest of the
way.
</P>
<P>
   The US chased Chong and tied the game, 2-2, in the bottom of the
seventh. Mike Kinkade reached on a bunt single (questionable call
at first), moved to third on a single to right by Mientkiewicz, and
scored on a sac fly by Marcus Jensen.
</P>
<P>
   Them came the weird stuff. In the bottom of the eighth, American
second baseman Brent Abernathy led with a double down the
left-field line. He went to third on a ground out. At this point,
thunder rocked the stadium. With the count, 2-1, on Mike Neill and
lightning flashing all around, Cuban home-plate umpire Cesar Valdes
pulled the teams off the field.
</P>
<P>
   Incredibly, they had a tarp. It got especially raw and windy
during the delay, but Olympic baseball officials insisted the game
would be resumed. After the delay (Kitty Litter was spread around
the infield), Neill returned to the plate and was intentionally
walked (the Koreans had a lot of time to think about the move).
Then Ernie Young was hit by a pitch to load the bases and Cotton
hit a grounder to third. The Korean third baseman fired home to
erase Abernathy.
</P>
<P>
   Abernathy had other ideas. Already out, he delivered a crackback
block to the Korean catcher. It was a cheap shot and the ump
immediately called a double play. Lasorda argued. Not Tommy's
finest moment.
</P>
<P>
   On to the ninth. Kinkade led and was hit by a pitch. Travis
Dawkins pinch ran and was picked off while Mientkiewicz was
batting. It appeared the US would do anything to avoid scoring.
</P>
<P>
   Then Mientkiewicz struck.
</P>
<P>
   And so Lasorda and his boys get their wish. It could be the
fullfillment of an American dream that began in 1992 when baseball
was first played as a medal sport in the Olympics. The '92 US team,
which included Nomar Garciaparra and Jason Varitek, lost to Cuba
but advanced to the bronze-medal game and lost to Japan.
</P>
<P>
   We lost to Cuba again in Atlanta in '96, but won a bronze,
beating Nicaragua in the consolation medal game. Cuba, meanwhile,
went 9-0 in both Olympiads and came to Australia intent on winning
gold again.
</P>
<P>
   The Cubans were beaten by the Netherlands, 4-2, in the first
round of the 2000 games, but have been otherwise perfect. They
crushed Lasorda's men, 6-1, in a combustible joust that featured
one bench-clearing episode and several other contentious incidents.
Americans accused the Cubans of playing dirty. US cleanup hitter
Young is still smarting from a Jose Ibar pitch that nailed him on
the shoulder.
</P>
<P>
   Cuban manager Servio Borges announced he'll start Norge Luis
Vera (don't count on it). Ben Sheets, a 22-year-old righty from the
Brewers system, gets the ball for the US. There've been no
sightings of Fidel Castro in Sydney. The Cubans are 25-3 lifetime
against America in international competition, 25-1 overall in three
Olympiads.
</P>
<P>
   Mientkiewicz said, ``If we play them the way we played Australia
and let it hang out a little, we'll give them a better game.''

LINDLAND'S OLYMPIC SAGA ENDS EARLY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By BOB RYAN  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   SYDNEY _ On first viewing the man, there is but one thought in
your head.
</P>
<P>
   John Malkovich wrestles? It is astonishing. It
(itals)is(unitals) John Malkovich, albeit with two spectacular
cauliflower ears.
</P>
<P>
   But this much we know: If and when a movie entitled ``Being Matt
Lindland'' ever appears on the big screen, it's unlikely that
anyone from the USOC will be queuing up for a ticket. For them,
Matt Lindland represents mounds of paper, innumerable phone calls,
and lawyers' fees.
</P>
<P>
   Lindland's Olympic saga ended Tuesday evening, with the man who
litigated his way to Sydney and then wrestled his way to the
championship match falling short of the ultimate goal. Mourat
Kardanov of Russia defeated Lindland by a 3-0 score to take home
the gold in the 76 kg (167 1/2 lb.) division of Greco-Roman
wrestling.
</P>
<P>
   ``I came in second to a Russian,'' Lindland said. ``That's not a
bad place in the Olympic Games. But it's not what I wanted. I
wanted to be first.''
</P>
<P>
   For all the aggravation he has caused the USOC in the past few
months, no one in authority is about to refuse the medal. We are
talking Greco-Roman wrestling, after all, and medals for the US in
this sport do not fall from the sky too often. Top 10 finishes are
rare enough, let alone medals. We're still looking for our first
non-boycott Olympic gold, and so if any of our lads can provide the
squad with something as prestigious as a silver medal, that's
breaking-out-the-bubbly time in Colorado Springs.
</P>
<P>
   Lindland certainly made news this summer. It all began when he
lost to Keith Sieracki in the 76 kg Olympic trials finals. But for
Mr. L., it was definitely not over. Arguing that Sieracki had
benefitted from an illegal leg lift (in this branch of wrestling,
there are no holds allowed below the legs and the legs themselves
cannot be used for anything other than support and balance),
Lindland protested. The fun was just beginning.
</P>
<P>
   The battle raged on, right up to the time the American squad
embarked for Sydney in early September. Sieracki kept prevailing
via the official USOC internal arbitration system. Lindland kept
winning via the American judicial system. It actually went all the
way to Supreme Court Justice John Paul Stevens, who declined to
hear the case.
</P>
<P>
   In the middle of it all there was a curious arbitration-mandated
re-match in Colorado Springs, which an unhappy Sieracki
participated in under his own protest and against his better
judgment. Lindland won this one, 8-0, and in his mind that should
have settled everything, once and for all.
</P>
<P>
   It was so ridiculous that the wrestling team was forced to take
two official team photos, one with Sieracki and one with Mal . . .
er . . . Lindland.
</P>
<P>
   Even now, there are Sieracki guys and Lindland guys. There are
people who think Lindland was right to protest and those who think
Sieracki won, fair and square. It just turned out to be a tedious,
boring, and damn near interminable process. Suffice it to say that
the summer of 2000 will not be fondly recalled by either the USOC
or USA Wrestling.
</P>
<P>
   The 30-year-old Lindland has remained outwardly unflappable
throughout the whole thing. He appears to be almost righteous in
his belief that all he did was rectify a clear wrong by utilizing a
process available to anyone. If anyone makes him out to be a bad
guy, and he can't possibly understand why, that's too bad. To his
way of thinking, the silver medal is proof that justice has
prevailed.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm sorry I had to get on the team that way, and that things
went the way they did,'' he shrugged, ``but I think the best guy
got on the team, and that's that. I got here because I was a better
wrestler than Keith was. I beat him in the re-match. It was 8-0 and
that's hard to get. So what people think won't bother me.''
</P>
<P>
   Asked what he'd like to say to Sieracki, he seemed almost
bewildered anyone would be interested. ``To Keith?'' he inquired.
``I'd just say good luck to you, and God bless you. I don't know
what else to say to him.''
</P>
<P>
   This is, quite clearly, a hard guy, and one quite capable of
focusing on the task at hand. He refused to allow the summer's
proceedings to interfere with his training, and it was obvious to
everyone he was very well prepared by the way he wrestled his way
to that gold-medal opportunity.
</P>
<P>
   As for the gold-medal match, he quickly fell behind, 3-0, when
he was turned in the first period, and when he couldn't capitalize
on his one good scoring opportunity in the second three-minute
period, he was done.
</P>
<P>
   ``The key was who got on top early,'' he explained. ``You want
to do it early if you can, because it's much slipperier in the
second period. But I knew he'd be tough. I hadn't wrestled him
before, but the Russians are always tough. Every time you wrestle a
Russian, it's a battle.''
</P>
<P>
   He insisted that his teammates held nothing against him and
understood that he was only trying to seek justice. ``We're a close
team,'' he declared. ``The Greco-Roman community is very close in
the US. Actually, worldwide.''
</P>
<P>
   But it must be reported that there were more than a few rolled
eyes in USOC circles this past week or so whenever the name of Matt
``The Litigator'' was brought up. They're accepting the medal while
holding their nose.
</P>
<P>
   And guess what? He's not going anywhere.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know what I'm going to do,'' he said. ``I'll be
talking it over with my wife. But I enjoy it, and I don't see why I
wouldn't want to continue. I'm not old. I'm not hurt. So why not?''
</P>
<P>
   So there it is, USOC. You've still got Matt Lindland, which
means your dangerous liaison will continue to keep you in the line
of fire.

2 PHOTOGRAPHY CENTERS JOIN TO FORM A VAST COLLECTION 
</HEADLINE>
  By CELESTINE BOHLEN   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Two major photography institutions _ the George
Eastman House in Rochester and the International Center of
Photography in New York City _ have entered an alliance that will
give New Yorkers more access to one of the world's greatest
collections of photographs and motion pictures.
</P>
<P>
   ``One organization has the advantage of location,'' said Willis
Hartshorn, director of the International Center of Photography,
which has galleries in New York and runs the city's largest
photography school. ``The other has the advantage of an
extraordinary collection. In terms of the public, the benefit is
mostly access.''
</P>
<P>
   Ronald H. Fielding, board chairman at the George Eastman House,
said that the alliance, which is not a merger, would result in a
series of operations _ from joint cataloging to a Web site _ to
benefit both institutions and the public.
</P>
<P>
   ``The educational programs are very complementary,'' Fielding
said. ``The ICP is very strong in degree programs for photographic
creation, whereas the strong point at Eastman House is preservation
and conservation.''
</P>
<P>
   With more than 5 million objects related to photography and film
in its 50-year-old collection, the Eastman museum owns 400,000
photographs by 8,000 photographers going back to the art form's
earliest years. Its collection of 25,000 motion pictures is a rival
to that of the Cinematheque in Paris and its library of
photographic books and journals is one of the world's most
encyclopedic.
</P>
<P>
   The International Center of Photography's collection
concentrates on the 1950s through the '70s, with special emphasis
on photojournalism. There will be a regular exchange of
exhibitions. The first program in an eight-part series called ``New
Histories of Photography'' is to open on Nov. 3 at the center's
expanded gallery space at 1133 Avenue of the Americas, at West 43rd
Street (reopening on Nov. 3 after renovations). The show, called
``Daguerreotypmania!,'' will feature rare artifacts connected with
the early years of photography.
</P>
<P>
   A show of photographs by Alfred Stieglitz donated to the Eastman
House by Georgia O'Keeffe and now on tour in Cologne, Germany, will

   ``Obviously a purpose of a nonprofit museum is to make its
collection available to the public,'' Fielding said. ``The Web does
that, but in terms of physical access, New York has a zillion more
people visiting museums as well as more funding resources.''
</P>
<P>
   Although it is one of the top tourist attractions in Rochester,
the Eastman museum, named after the founder of the Eastman Kodak
Co., who produced the first mass market amateur camera, has been
stretched thin financially as it struggled to maintain its
collection. After a proposal to transfer the collection to the
Smithsonian Institution in Washington was quashed by local
protests, an endowment drive began that collected $35 million,
helping to build a modern archive building next to the original
George Eastman mansion.
</P>
<P>
   By teaming up with the ICP, the Eastman museum seeks to
strengthen its fund-raising, exchange information and staff, and
expand the opportunity for research. Filing jointly for their first
shared grant, the two institutions have already received $120,000
from the National Endowment for the Arts.
</P>
<P>
   For the center's 5,000 students, most of them enrolled in
continuing education classes, the arrangement will provide a wealth
of material for research.
</P>
<P>
   The Web site, to be running next spring, will include 10,000
images from the museums' collections as well as material on the
history of photography.

`TWILIGHT: LOS ANGELES, 1992': MAGIC OF STAGE MEETS REALITY IN
CLIPS 
</HEADLINE>
 (Eds.: Production notes are at end of review.) 
 By DAVE KEHR   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   With ``Twilight: Los Angeles,'' the documentary and video maker
Marc Levin has transformed Anna Deavere Smith's much-honored
performance piece ``Twilight: Los Angeles, 1992'' into something
both more and less than itself.
</P>
<P>
   More in that Levin has introduced documentary clips of the 1992
Los Angeles civic disturbances that are the subject of Smith's
play, and less in that the added images diminish the impact of
Smith's extraordinary skills as an actor.
</P>
<P>
   In the stage piece, Smith shifts seamlessly among dozens of
characters, moving from the bored complacency of a Beverly Hills
real estate agent to the explosive syntax and hammering gestures of
a South-Central teen-ager. Drawing her text from hundreds of
interviews she conducted after the videotaped police beating of
Rodney King in 1991, Smith creates a vocal symphony of amazing
range and power, a chorus of widely different voices placed in
precise and revealing counterpoint.
</P>
<P>
   It is an extraordinary piece of journalism and a virtuoso
display of technique, as if Smith had turned her whole body into a
kind of recording machine, able to reproduce an encounter and its
smallest nuances with breathtaking fidelity. At one moment Smith is
the bitter widow of a Korean grocer killed in the looting after the
acquittal of the police officers in the case; at another she is the
Los Angeles police chief, Daryl Gates, lamely explaining why he
left police headquarters to attend a fund-raising party on the
first night of disturbances; at another she is Charlton Heston,
grinning as he remembers his liberal friends calling him in the
hope of borrowing a spare shotgun.
</P>
<P>
   It seems strangely deflating, then, when the real Gates appears
in a news clip or turns up for a conversation with Smith and a
community activist seven years later. At these moments, the smeary
video images seem much less evocative and much less precise than
Smith's full-bodied impersonations.
</P>
<P>
   ``Twilight: Los Angeles, 1992,'' relies heavily on cinematic
montage techniques: Smith's transitions between characters are
unmarked and perfectly fluid, as if she were simply cutting from
one close-up to another. On film, Levin, whose ``Slam'' was a
sensation on the festival circuit in 1998, has decided to identify
the shifting characters with subtitles, both to underline the
moments of transition and to provide background information. The
Rodney King video is played repeatedly, and there is a wide
selection of news clippings of jubilant looters and smoldering
buildings.
</P>
<P>
   These intrusions end up making the movie seem less cinematic
than the stage production. Levin has clearly been faced with a
dilemma: to simply record Smith's stage work in the manner of a
concert film like ``Kings of Comedy'' would leave too much of the
material out of context and unexplained. But to make a straight
documentary on the 1992 disturbances would be to obliterate Smith's
amazing artistry.
</P>
<P>
   The resulting compromise does not produce a perfect film, but it
is a fine record of a classic production and an important reminder
of an event that has not stopped echoing in American culture.

&HT;     REPORT GIVES 13 STATES FAILING GRADES ON TEACHING EVOLUTION 
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 &HT;     By DAN FREEDMAN  
 &HT;     c.2000 Hearst Newspapers  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Seventy-five years after the Scopes ``Monkey
Trial'' in Tennessee, a scientist's report issued Tuesday gave 13
states failing grades for neglecting to teach evolution.
</P>
<P>
   Many states do not use the word ``evolution'' in science
standards and one _ Kansas _ has deleted all references to the age
of the Earth or universe.
</P>
<P>
   The report by Lawrence Lerner, a professor emeritus in the
physics and astronomy department at California State University in
Long Beach, was sponsored by the Thomas B. Fordham Foundation.
Although nonpartisan, the foundation has supported the education
ideas of Republican presidential nominee George W. Bush.
</P>
<P>
   Lerner presented the paper _ ``The Teaching of Evolution in U.S.
Schools: Where Politics, Religion and Science Converge'' _ at a
day-long forum of the American Association for the Advancement of
Science.
</P>
<P>
   Evolution ``is not a controversial issue among scientists, nor
among most of the world's educated persons,'' Lerner wrote in the
report. The controversy over evolution ``is not really about
science, but about religion and politics,'' pitting science
educators against those ``who assert that evolution has not taken
place (and) that it is `only fair' to present creationist views to
students in tandem with evolution.''
</P>
<P>
   In the report, Lerner called creation science ``a
pseudoscientific rival to evolution that the courts have repeatedly
held to be thinly veiled religion.''
</P>
<P>
   Creation science is teaching that supports the view that the
Earth and humankind were created by God. Evolution, on the other
hand, stems from the scientific theories of 19th century British
naturalist Charles Darwin.
</P>
<P>
   At a news conference, Lerner said that despite continuing
controversy over evolution, ``the situation is very much in flux I
have high hopes for the future.''
</P>
<P>
   The education standards enacted in recent years are likely to
lead to competition among the states, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``The states tend to vie with each other,'' he said. ``They say
`Jeez, you know, we don't have as high standards as our neighboring
state, let's do something about it.'''
</P>
<P>
   Speaking at the same news conference, Eugenie Scott, executive
director of the National Center for Science Education Inc., said
the lack of evolution teaching in a state seriously hampers the
scientific education of students in its schools.
</P>
<P>
   ``Evolution is a basic organizing principle in several
sciences,'' she said. ``It's fact of the universe that change has
taken place; this is shown in astronomy, geology and biology. You
really can't consider yourself to be fully educated if you don't
understand evolution as a part of science.''
</P>
<P>
   The Lerner report assigns a grade to each state based on how
thoroughly or scantily it treats evolution in science education
standards.
</P>
<P>
   California, Connecticut, Indiana, New Jersey, North Carolina and
Rhode Island each scores 100. Among other states, Washington
receives an 86 (``brief, straightforward account of evolution'')
and Michigan an 84 (``a well-organized treatment of evolution'').
Both are Bs.
</P>
<P>
   New York gets a 68 (``this otherwise satisfactory document
suffers from sloppy organization and inclusion of creationist
jargon'') and Texas a 64 (``brief but satisfactory no human
evolution.''). Both are Cs.
</P>
<P>
   The report reserves its most scathing reviews for states
receiving an ``F'': Wyoming, Maine, Ohio, Oklahoma, New Hampshire,
Florida, Alabama, North Dakota, Georgia, Mississippi, West
Virginia, Kansas and Tennessee.
</P>
<P>
   ``It seems the Scopes trial is still under way in Tennessee,''
the report says. ``None of the sketchy biology coverage makes
sense.''
</P>
<P>
   The Lerner gives its lowest grade _ F-minus _ to Kansas. The
state's educational standard ``avoids all discussion of the age of
the Earth or the universe, or any other topic touching on the
history of the Earth or universe,'' the report says.
</P>
<P>
   The Kansas board of education voted to drop evolution from state
science standards last year. But board elections this November are
very likely to change the panel from support of creationism to
support of evolution.
</P>
<P>
   Asked about the report's ranking of Kansas, state education
department spokeswoman Kathy Toelkes said ``I don't have any
comment on it other than I don't think we're surprised.''
</P>
<P>
   The famous trial of science teacher John Scopes took place 75
years ago in Dayton, Tenn. With fiery orator and ex-presidential
contender William Jennings Bryan as prosecutor and celebrated
Chicago lawyer Clarence Darrow for the defense, the trial came to
symbolize the clash between modern scientific ideas and traditional
religion in 20th Century America.
</P>
<P>
   Scopes deliberately violated a Tennessee state law that barred
the teaching of evolution. Despite Darrow's impassioned defense,
the teacher was convicted of violating the law. But the conviction
was overturned on appeal. Scopes died in 1970.

 &HT;    PARENTS WANT MORE SEX EDUCATION IN SCHOOLS, SURVEY FINDS
 &HT;    By KAVITA KUMAR
 &HT;    c.2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Parents want public schools to offer more
information on sex education topics such as birth control,
abortion, rape, and sexual orientation, the Kaiser Family
Foundation reported Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   The group's survey revealed a seeming contradiction: While most
parents want their children to abstain from sex, they also want
them to be taught about birth control and safer sex.
</P>
<P>
   Even among the one-third of parents who said they wanted their
school's main message to be abstinence until marriage, most said
educators should teach about how to get tested for HIV/AIDS and
other sexually transmitted diseases (STD), how to use condoms, and
where to get and how to use other birth control.
</P>
<P>
   ``What comes from this study is that parents looks to schools to
prepare their children for real life,'' said Tina Hoff, director of
the Foundation's public education program. ``Their concerns are
practical, not political.''
</P>
<P>
   Of students surveyed, small majorities said they want to learn
more about what to do in cases of rape or assault or how to get
tested for STDs, and 46 percent said they want more information on
how to discuss birth control and STDs with a partner.
</P>
<P>
   In a panel discussion that followed release of the report,
Michael Nesbitt, an 11th-grade student in the nation's capital,
said there's no alternative to talking about safe sex and birth
control in schools.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think they said the average age of marriage is 25 or 28,''
Michael said. ``That's a long time, and it's not realistic for many
to wait that long'' to have sex.
</P>
<P>
   Michael's mother, Deborah, said she would welcome a
comprehensive sexual education program for her three sons.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think the most information they can get could not be any
harm to them,'' she said. ``I'd rather they learn it in a school
environment and from what I enforce at home rather than other
ways.''
</P>
<P>
   But some, like Liz Alston, chair of the Charleston County (S.C.)
School District's board of trustees, said it is hard to reconcile
parents' desire to protect their children and their willingness for
schools to teach more about sex.
</P>
<P>
   ``Parents want their cake and to eat it too. They want it both
ways.'' said Alston, who is a proponent of abstinence-only sexual
education. ``You can't talk about things like sexual orientation
(in the classroom), because then people will start questioning
their identity.''
</P>
<P>
   There are two basic models of sexual education used in the
United States: ``abstinence-only'' and ``comprehensive.''
</P>
<P>
   In abstinence-only curricula, the message is that students
should wait until they are married to have sex. Comprehensive
programs, which are more prevalent, follow the philosophy that
young people should wait to have sex, but if they don't, they
should use birth control and practice safe sex.
</P>
<P>
   The survey shows that in practice, the lines between the two
types of sex education blur in the classroom. Abstinence-only
classes often discuss birth control, while comprehensive programs
usually stress abstinence and address pressures to have sex.
</P>
<P>
   Susan Soule is a teacher in Silver Spring, Md., for 15 years,
said that three of the 18 weeks in her 10th-grade health class are
spent dealing with sexual education.
</P>
<P>
   ``The buck stops here,'' Soule said. ``This is 10th grade, and
this is the only place students are going to get this information.
It might be the last time they get it in their lives.''
</P>
<P>
   While Soule stresses abstinence in her class, she says she's
wary of dictating a norm to her students, many of whom have parents
who are not married. And while she has a comprehensive program, she
can't introduce the topics of abortion or sexual orientation
because of local school policies. But she can answer questions
about those issues if students raise them, and they inevitably do,
Soule said.
</P>
<P>
   The Kaiser foundation, an independent health care organization
based in California, surveyed more than 4,000 students, parents,
teachers and principals in public schools, grades 7 through 12,
about the status and needs of current sexual education programs.
</P>
<P>
   Fieldwork for the report, titled ``Sex Education in America: A
View from Inside the Nation's Classrooms,'' was completed between
February and May, 1999. Responses to questions in the survey have a
margin of error of three to six percentage points.

   OLY-SOCCW-ADV _ The United States women's soccer team arrived
here after weeks of training and playing at satellite venues and
will face Norway Thursday in the gold medal match. It would be hard
to find more evenly matched, or familiar, rivals at these Olympics
in any sport. The U.S. squad, the reigning Olympic and World Cup
champions, began this tournament by beating Norway 2-0 even before
the Olympic torch was lit. ``After we played them I knew we would
see them again,'' said U.S. star Mia Hamm, now an Austin resident.

   OLY-WRESTLER _ SYDNEY _ From Amarillo to Australia. It's not a

But Brandon Slay is here at the Olympics. Born and bred in a state

   OLY-SOFT-GEORGE 27 _ BLACKTOWN, New South Wales _ There is
crying in softball. Tuesday night's Olympic gold medal game, won by
the U.S. on a dropped fly ball in extra innings, started a flood
for both teams. For the American women, who lost their air of
invincibility in this tournament but not their prize, and for the
Japanese, who won every game but this one, this was as wrenching as
any World Series, as dramatic as any trumped-up movie scene. ``I
fought for this country the best way I can and that is on the
softball field,'' said Lisa Fernandez, who clouded up during
interviews last week when the U.S. was in the midst of a shocking
three-game losing streak and did it again Tuesday when the
four-year mission to repeat as Olympic champions had reached it
successful conclusion. (George, Palm Beach Post).

Open tennis champion from Russia may yet prove a flash in the pan.
Forget, too, president and judo expert Vladimir Putin. Smirking
about last month's sinking of the nuclear submarine Kursk with 118
sailors aboard during a recent CNN interview isn't likely to
improve his stature. No, for a country desperate to restore its
former greatness and grasping for a unifying symbol, Olympic
wrestler Alexander Karelin _ a.k.a. ``The Experiment'' _ is the
closest thing Russia has to a national hero. Entering the Sydney
Olympics, the 32-year-old Karelin boasts one of the most astounding
records in international sports competition: 12 European
championships, nine world championships and three Olympic gold
medals. The 285-pound, 6-foot-four-inch super heavyweight from
Siberia has not lost a match since 1987. (Nelson, Special to Cox
News Service).

   PROVISIONAL _ Plans to scrap the provisional admission program
at UT-Austin have raised questions over why the University of Texas
can't say no when it comes to Longhorn wannabes. While colleges
across the country have eliminated their second chance admissions,
UT is likely the last holdout. Some say it's the longheld Texas
belief that graduating from UT is every Texan's right. Others say
it's time UT is realistic about getting a hold on its numbers. The
proposal has sparked lots of debate just as UT System regents are
to consider the plan this month. (Jayson, Austin

   TAX-PENSIONS _ WASHINGTON _ You'll be able to put a lot more
money into your tax-protected IRA or 401(k) retirement savings
account, if the Senate can get its act together in the next two
weeks. Twice, the House has voted overwhelmingly for the bipartisan
pension reform/tax-cut plan assembled over three years by Reps. Rob
Portman, R-Ohio and Ben Cardin, D-Md. The Clinton administration
would like to see some fine-tuning. But the basic problem is that
the Senate GOP leadership can't find time to consider the bill,
even though it could help many millions of rich and middle-class
Americans, while hurting only a few million working-class
employees. (Mollison, Cox News Service). With Textbox.

   POLIO _ This summer, world health officials - including the CDC
- acknowledged they would not meet an oft-stated goal of ridding
the world of polio by the end of this year. Today, (Sept. 27), many
of those officials leading the fight will join Ted Turner and other
big spenders who are helping to fund the effort, in a ``polio
summit'' to explore why the fight is not being won on time. The NYC
meeting is intended to redirect attention away from the
public-health failure and focus media attention on the last push to
eradicate polio - which WHO hopes to accomplish shortly. To set up
the conference, we take a look at why 15-20 of the 30 countries
which had polio at the end of 1999 still do and ask ``What's taking
so long?'' (McKenna, The Altanta Journal-Constitution)

   HISPANIC _ The music was loud and Latino. The message was
custom-made for the crowd packed into Miami's Coconut Grove
Convention Center for a GOP rally. ``We Hispanics have become the
most important electoral block in the country,'' said George P.
Bush, the Mexican-American nephew of the Republican presidential
nominee. But barring large-scale, last-minute population shifts,
George P. is overstating the case in the current presidential race.

   CENSUS-POVERTY _ WASHINGTON _ WASHINGTON _ Americans enjoyed
substantial income gains for a record fifth consecutive year in
1999, with inflation-adjusted earnings rising to $40,816 for a
typical family, its highest level since income data were first
recorded in 1967, the Census Bureau reported Tuesday. The strong
economy also drove the poverty rate to its lowest level since 1979
-- with the number of poor people falling by 2.2 million compared
to 1998. The effect of the rolling good times were felt equally by
whites, blacks, Hispanics and other ethnic groups, according to the
income and poverty data. A national story with state inserts.

&HT;     ABORTION RIGHTS GROUP WANTS PRO-CHOICE REPUBLICANS TO SUPPORT
GORE 
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     (EDS: News grafs 8-10 with anti-abortion group's response.)  
 &HT;     (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 &HT;     By JENNIFER A. DLOUHY  
 &HT;     c.2000 Hearst Newspapers  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ A national abortion rights organization announced
Tuesday that it is launching a $5-million, 15-state campaign to
persuade pro-choice independent and Republican voters to support
Democrat Al Gore.
</P>
<P>
   The National Abortion and Reproductive Rights Action League
(NARAL) will target two million voters who favor abortion rights.
NARAL President Kate Michelman said the organization will use
direct mail, Internet advertising and phone calls ``to mobilize the
pro-choice vote.''
</P>
<P>
   ``This election will be won on the ground, voter by voter,
neighborhood by neighborhood district by district from
congressional races all the way up to the presidency,'' Michelman
told a news conference.
</P>
<P>
   NARAL also released its list of House candidates who the group
believes are unlikely to support abortion rights. In those
districts, NARAL will lobby for the pro-choice alternatives,
Michelman said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Defeating these candidates will enable us to pick up key seats
in the House, returning leadership to the hands of House members
committed to protecting a woman's right to choose,'' Michelman
said.
</P>
<P>
   Texas Gov. George W. Bush, the Republican presidential nominee,
is at the top of the NARAL's ``worst choice list.''
</P>
<P>
   Targeted Republican or independent voters will be contacted
between four and seven times before the Nov. 7 election, Michelman
said.
</P>
<P>
   She said NARAL is targeting voters in California, Florida, Iowa,
Michigan, Missouri, Minnesota, Montana, New Hampshire, New Mexico,
Ohio, Pennsylvania, New Jersey, New York, Washington and Wisconsin.
</P>
<P>
   Michelman said NARAL has compiled its list of pro-choice
Republican or independent voters from previous get-out-the vote
drives and from records of campaign contributors.
</P>
<P>
   An anti-abortion advocacy group _ the SBA List Candidate Fund _
responded to the NARAL announcement by issuing a statement claiming
that ``NARAL'S success will be measured by how deceptive'' it is to
voters because most voters support a ban on late-term abortions, a
ban vehemently opposed by NARAL.
</P>
<P>
   The SBA group _ named after Susan B. Anthony, the crusader for
women's suffrage and abortion opponent _ also accused NARAL of
being ``deceptive'' in claiming that abortion rights would be
terminated if Republican presidential candidate George W. Bush wins
the election and nominates anti-abortion U.S. Supreme Court
justices.
</P>
<P>
   If the Supreme Court then reversed the Roe Vs. Wade abortion
decision, it would mean that abortion policy would once again be
the responsibility of voters in the states, ``rather than in the
hands of nine justices in Washington,'' the SBA List statement
asserted.
</P>
<P>
   NARAL joins Emily's List, another abortion rights advocacy
organization, in seeking support of undecided women voters to elect
pro-choice Democratic women to Congress.
</P>
<P>
   Women hold unprecedented power as a voting bloc, said Ellen
Malcolm, president of Emily's List, a political action committee.
</P>
<P>
   ``Women are going to determine the outcome of this election,''
Malcolm said. ``Women make up the vast majority of the undecided
electorate.''
</P>
<P>
   According to an Emily's List-sponsored poll earlier this month,
12 percent of registered women voters were unsure who they would
vote for president, compared to 6 percent of male voters.
</P>
<P>
   In congressional races, 24 percent of women were undecided,
compared to 17 percent of men. The survey of 1,267 voters had a
margin of error of plus or minus 2.9 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Emily's List is working to mobilize female voters likely to
support women and Democratic candidates with a $10 million
campaign. In 1998, the organization sent nearly 8 million pieces of
mail and made over two million telephone calls to 3.4 million women
in 26 states as part of its get-out-the-vote initiative. In 1998,
members of the organization contributed $7.5 million to Democratic
women candidates.

 &HT;     Commentary 
 &HT;     By JAMES LILEKS 
 &HT;     c.2000 Newhouse News Service 
<TEXT>
<P>
   (UNDATED) It's been an interesting week for Al Gore _
``interesting'' in the sense that watching someone saw your legs
off is interesting, if you're sufficiently sedated. The race has
tightened, as everyone knew it would; the issues are taking second
place to vague perceptions about the candidates, as they usually
do. Some highlights from Gore's week of weakening numbers:
</P>
<P>
   1. The Union Lullaby Gaffe. Appearing before some union folks,
Gore touted his lifelong union credentials and shared a warm
recollection of hearing a union jingle as a lullaby. Unfortunately,
the jingle wasn't used until Gore was in his mid-20s. Perhaps Pappy
sang some other union jingle at baby's bedtime _ ``Kill the Bosses!
Grind Their Bones! Drink Their Blood! Burn Their Homes!'' was a
popular number in those days, but it gave children nightmares.
</P>
<P>
   Watching the video, you can almost see Gore struggling with the
anecdote, as if he has a nagging suspicion that it's actually
false. Anyone who's seen ``Blade Runner'' knows exactly what's
happening here: It's the point where he realizes he is a synthetic
being, programmed with the memories of other people. No one's tried
the Android Defense yet, but they've dragged out the usual excuses:
He was tired. He was misquoted. He was caught by surprise. He was
hopped up on goofballs. He will lie about anything, to anyone,
anywhere, to achieve and maintain power. Hah! Just kidding about
that last one. No, it was the cold medication.
</P>
<P>
   The press has a good chuckle and moves along to the job at hand:
debating whether George W. Bush is stupid, dim, congenitally daft,
or just charmingly ``tetched'' like the small-town lunatic who
lives in a shack behind the gas station and SEEMS harmless until he
strangles eight little girls.
</P>
<P>
   That's the real story, don't you know.
</P>
<P>
   2. The Mole in Bush's Camp. Gore's people have allegedly
inserted an operative into the Bush camp, and this guy is feeding
Gore inside info. Stories like this make the media nervous; where's
the Bush-Is-Stupid angle here? Ah: too stupid to catch a spy under
his own nose! Can't trust him with national security. Why, it would
have taken Bush twice as long to mishandle the Wen Ho Lee case.
</P>
<P>
   Besides, Richard Nixon broke into Watergate _ that's right,
Nixon. He slipped away from a state dinner, slipped into a black
ninja outfit, slipped into the Watergate from the roof, greased
himself with oil and slid through the ventilation ducts,
chloroformed the guard, stole the Democratic secrets, lasered a
hole in the window, rappelled to freedom and ran back to the White
House in time for the second course. Tricky Dick? You don't know
the half of it.
</P>
<P>
   So ... even if Gore had a mole in Bush's camp, Nixon was first
and Nixon was worse. But even if it's true, and even if laws were
broken, isn't it time we moved beyond the politics of hate? The
politics of division? The politics of prosecuting people for laws
they've broken?
</P>
<P>
   3. Winter's coming; demand for heating oil has risen; prices
follow. To quote a variety of tenured economists: Duh. Gore regards
this as a calamity and petitions President Clinton to release a
laughably minuscule amount of oil from the strategic reserves. This
gave the nation a reminder of Gore's energy policy:
</P>
<P>
   A. Don't nobody drill for nothing nowhere ever, amen. Doesn't
matter if people freeze _ better Granny in Boston has blue lips to
match her hair than one Alaskan elk get the runs from licking
grease off an oil well.
</P>
<P>
   B. Support alternative energy. Examples of successful
replacements for gas: welllll ... none. So far. But only because we
haven't spent enough! If we spend just a few hundred billion more,
a perpetual motion machine will magically appear from the eighth
dimension. Besides, Big Oil probably has assassins that stifle any
successful new technology. That's how it is in the movies, anyway.
</P>
<P>
   Training the population to think that government can micromanage
markets is short-sighted, since the people will expect government
to do it again. The price of bread goes up? Why, tap the Strategic
Bread Reserve. Anyone deluded enough to think this will work
deserves a president who holds them in such contempt _ which is why
it was heartening to see Gore lose numbers. He may think we're
stupid; he depends on it. But not everyone seems to be as stupid as
he needs them to be.

&HT;     RENO AND FREEH DEFIANTLY DEFEND U.S. TREATMENT OF LEE 
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)   
 &HT;     By MARK HELM  
 &HT;     c.2000 Hearst Newspapers   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Attorney General Janet Reno and FBI Director Louis
Freeh offered no apologies on Tuesday for their treatment of Wen Ho
Lee _ including holding him in solitary confinement _ and insisted
that the nuclear scientist was a ``national security risk.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The FBI believed solitary confinement was needed to restrict
Dr. Lee's ability to pass information through intermediaries that
could have the consequence of disseminating the nuclear secrets he
had stolen,'' Freeh told a joint meeting of the Senate intelligence
and judiciary committees investigating the case.
</P>
<P>
   He added that Lee's lawyers never complained about their
client's treatment while in jail. ``We were not aware of this being
a factor,'' Freeh said.
</P>
<P>
   Reno said: ``Dr. Lee was a national security risk and needed to
be treated carefully.''
</P>
<P>
   She said Lee was kept in manacles during exercise periods and
when being transported ``because that was the treatment of all
prisoners in the area where he was being held, and we didn't want
to have Dr. Lee treated differently from the others.''
</P>
<P>
   In December, Lee, a physicist at the nuclear weapons laboratory
in Los Alamos, N.M., was indicted on 59 counts alleging the
scientist of transferring huge amounts of secret atomic research
data from the classified computer system at Los Alamos weapons lab.
</P>
<P>
   But earlier this month, Lee pleaded guilty to a single felony
count of mishandling information at the laboratory. Under terms of
the plea bargain, the 58 other counts of breaching national
security Lee faced were dropped and he was sentenced to 278 days _
essentially the time he's served since his arrest last December.
Lee also agreed to tell FBI agents what he did with seven missing
computer tapes.
</P>
<P>
   During Lee's sentencing hearing, the case's presiding judge,
James A. Parker, apologized to the scientist for what he said was a
questionable indictment. Parker also said the FBI ``misled'' him
about Lee's supposedly deceptive behavior and ignored his urgings
that the government ease the ``demeaning, unnecessarily punitive
conditions'' under which Lee was being held.
</P>
<P>
   On Tuesday, several senators echoed Parker's remarks.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Arlen Specter, R-Penn., questioned whether the government's
treatment of Lee was an attempt to pressure the scientist into
admitting to crimes he never committed.
</P>
<P>
   `` The manacles, the false testimony given by the FBI raise a
possible inference _ and I say only possible _ that these were
pressures to compel a guilty plea,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Richard Bryan, D-Nev., while acknowledging that Lee broke
the law, said the scientist's treatment ``far exceeded legitimate
measures designed to prevent the possible compromise of
information, including, we are told, his shackling and a light in
his cell 24 hours a day, even shackling when he was performing his
authorized exercise each day.''
</P>
<P>
   Despite the harsh criticism, neither Freeh nor Reno refused to
back away from their handling of the case, saying Lee put the
entire world at risk.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was not careless. It was not innocent,'' said Freeh, adding
that Lee deliberately transferred nuclear weapons secrets that
``could change the global strategic balance'' to computers open to
anyone on the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   Reno said: ``Dr. Lee is no hero, he is no absent-minded
professor.''
</P>
<P>
   The attorney general also staunchly denied charges that Lee _ a
Taiwanese-born naturalized citizen _ was a victim of racial
profiling. ``There was no effort on anybody's part to target him
because of his race,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Freeh repeatedly insisted that the FBI could have successfully
prosecuted Lee if the case had gone to trial. ``Each of those
counts could be proven in December 1999, and each one of them could
be proven today,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Freeh said that the government sought a plea bargain to settle
the case only to avoid disclosing nuclear secrets in court and to
find out what Lee did with seven tapes he made of secret material
taken from Los Alamos computers.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Department of Justice and the FBI concluded that this
guilty plea, coupled with Lee's agreement to submit to questioning
under oath and to a polygraph, was our best opportunity to protect
the national security by finding out what happened to the seven
missing tapes, as well as to the additional copies of the tapes
that he now admitted to have made,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   According to Freeh, Lee came under investigation in 1982 and
1994 for contacts he made with foreign scientists, including
China's top nuclear scientist, but his security pass was not lifted
because he passed polygraph tests.
</P>
<P>
   Freeh said that it was not until last year that FBI agents and
Los Alamos computer engineers concluded that Lee deliberately
worked from 1994 to 1999 to get around Los Alamos security systems
to transfer classified files from secure Energy Department
computers to computers open to the public and to computer tapes.
</P>
<P>
   ``At least seven _ and possibly 14 or more _ tapes containing
vast amounts of our nation's nuclear secrets remain unaccounted
for. This is not rhetoric. It is a simple, frightening fact,'' a
joint statement by Reno and Freeh said.
</P>
<P>
   Bryan called the probe ``a Keystone Kops investigation,'' saying
lab officials should have taken away Lee's top secret security
clearance ``years ago.''
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Richard Shelby, R-Ala., chairman of the Senate Intelligence
Committee, said he would call Reno and Freeh to a closed session of
the committee to provide further details of what secrets were lost.
</P>
<P>
   Shelby said the government has yet to resolve the central
question of how China obtained some of America's most sensitive
secrets on how nuclear bombs are made and assembled.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier this year, a select House committee, chaired by Rep.
Christopher Cox, R-Calif., charged that China had stolen
information on every warhead in the U.S. ballistic missile arsenal.

CHINA PROTESTS VATICAN'S PLAN TO CANONIZE MISSIONARIES 
</HEADLINE>
   By ERIK ECKHOLM   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   BEIJING _ China stepped up its attacks on the Vatican Tuesday
for its plans to canonize 120 Catholics who were killed in China
between 1648 and 1930.
</P>
<P>
   Though the Vatican considers them martyrs for their faith, a
Chinese government spokesman contended that many had ``committed
monstrous crimes against the Chinese people,'' and he accused the
Vatican of glorifying Western imperialism.
</P>
<P>
   ``The majority of these people were executed for violation of
Chinese laws during the invasion of China by imperialists and
colonialists, or were killed for bullying Chinese people during the
Opium War or the invasion by the eight allied powers,'' the
spokesman, Sun Yuxi, said on Tuesday at a foreign ministry news
conference.
</P>
<P>
   The dispute appears to reflect a recent worsening of relations
between China and the Vatican, despite reports of secret talks
during the past year apparently aimed at reconciliation.
</P>
<P>
   European invasions of the 19th century _ the Opium War of
1839-42, which forced China to allow sales of the drug, and the
invasion by Western powers in 1900 to suppress the anti-foreign
Boxer movement _ are remembered bitterly here as national
humiliations.
</P>
<P>
   The Vatican's recently announced plan to give sainthood to 87
Chinese Catholics and 33 European missionaries, many of whom were
killed during those events, has touched a raw nerve among political
leaders, who say the Roman Catholic Church itself helped to
subjugate China in the past and plotted against the Communist
revolution.
</P>
<P>
   The Vatican has scheduled the canonization ceremony for Oct. 1,
which is the anniversary of the founding of the People's Republic.
Vatican officials say the date was selected simply because it is
the feast of St. Theresa of Lisieux, patron of missions.
</P>
<P>
   In a statement issued late Tuesday, Joaquin Navarro Valls, the
Vatican's spokesman, said, ``Next Sunday's ceremony has no
political motivation and is not directed against anyone.'' The
missionaries to be canonized, he said, had sacrificed ``to serve
the Chinese people,'' and he accused Chinese officials of a
``unilateral reading of history.''
</P>
<P>
   The Chinese spokesman's attack and another stinging denunciation
of the Vatican on Tuesday by China's official Patriotic Catholic
Church, which does not accept the authority of the pope, were
featured on the television news here Tuesday night.
</P>
<P>
   China and the Vatican broke ties in 1951 and Chinese Catholics
have been split ever since. Today, the official Patriotic Catholic
Church says it has 70 bishops and 4 million followers. Vatican
officials have estimated that 8 million Chinese, along with many
priests and bishops, remain loyal to the pope in a parallel illegal
church that faces frequent police harassment.
</P>
<P>
   Apparently in an effort to minimize the provocation of Beijing,
the Vatican did not include any Catholics killed under Communist
rule in its new list of prospective saints.
</P>
<P>
   But Vatican leaders were angered in January when China made a
show of ordaining several new bishops of its official church on the
same day the pope was to ordain bishops.
</P>
<P>
   Last week a top Vatican official, Cardinal Roger Etchegaray, 77,
made a rare public visit to Beijing to attend a conference, giving
rise to speculation about a possible breakthrough in relations.
</P>
<P>
   But there was little sign of that this week when Etchegaray, in
an interview in Rome, said that in his meetings with church
officials here, he had ``protested energetically against a new wave
of arrests of the faithful, even of bishops, which took place when
I was in China.''
</P>
<P>
   The official church in China issued a statement on Tuesday
accusing the Vatican of attempting ``to distort and tamper with
history'' and of ignoring traditionally stringent requirements for
sainthood.
</P>
<P>
   ``Quite a few of those to be canonized are notorious,'' the
official church's statement said, calling them ``accomplices of
imperialists.''

FOR SOME, HIP-HOP SHOW IS NOT HIP ENOUGH 
</HEADLINE>
   By NINA SIEGAL   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ David Bett, an art director for a hip-hop music
label, drove to the Brooklyn Museum of Art on Saturday with his
wife and three children, playing L.L. Cool J on the car stereo to
prepare them for what they were about to witness.
</P>
<P>
   Orvil M. Minott, 24, a rock and hip-hop musician, walked to the
museum with a group of ``at risk'' teen-agers he works with at a
nonprofit group in nearby Flatbush. And Joe Correale, 28, who as a
teen-ager in the Bronx took part in ``park jams,'' where DJs and
MCs spun the first fledgling raps, arrived by subway to see how his
borough's history was being displayed.
</P>
<P>
   The patrons of the Brooklyn Museum's new exhibition, ``Hip-Hop
Nation: Roots, Rhymes and Rage,'' listening to rap music in
educational kiosks, watching videos about subway graffiti artists
and marveling over the enormity of the rap star Biggy Small's
sweatsuit, looked markedly different from the museum's typical
weekend crowd. They were younger and more ethnically diverse, and a
striking number said they had a personal connection to the material
on display, whether they were record company executives, former
graffiti writers, young aspiring DJs or teen-agers who simply said
they had never known life without hip-hop.
</P>
<P>
   And although many praised the museum for presenting the show,
the first of its kind in a major American museum, and said they
enjoyed its vitality and its comprehensive approach to the music,
some walked out with the lingering feeling that the hip-hop they
saw on the walls was quite different from the hip-hop they knew
from the streets.
</P>
<P>
   The show, originally mounted by the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame
in Cleveland and changed only minimally (a few graffiti art pieces
were added) by Kevin Stayton, a curator at the Brooklyn Museum, was
sponsored in part by Def Jam Records. It features hundreds of items
_ including rappers' clothes, concert posters and historical
memorabilia linking hip-hop to older cultural touchstones _ and
several video displays, all in four galleries on the first floor.
The exhibition focuses primarily on music icons and commercial
aspects of the culture, but is tame in its approach, presenting
some information on gangsta rap without addressing the harsh lyrics
and videos that have given rap its troublesome reputation.
</P>
<P>
   But because there was little material about break-dancing and
only a handful of graffiti paintings, some patrons said they were
disappointed that the exhibition did not reflect more deeply the
various forms that gave birth to the genre.
</P>
<P>
   ``Especially right here in our neighborhood, I was hoping it
would be something we could come to and feel connected to,'' Minott
said. ``But I don't feel connected. This is giving us the glamour
of hip-hop, but it doesn't give any of the political message and
the political struggle that the music is about.''
</P>
<P>
   That view was echoed by other artists who consider themselves
part of hip-hop's history. Aaron Goodstone, 34, who has been a
graffiti artist for 20 years and goes by the name Sharp, said that
the exhibition placed too much emphasis on music and did not
adequately represent the two other essential components of the
culture, the visual arts and dance.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was all focused on people who rap,'' Goodstone said. ``I
think it's so unfair that because rap is already an industry, all
the other people who contributed to the movement and the arts in it
were cast in shadow behind the rappers.''
</P>
<P>
   But others said they felt that the exhibition paid appropriate
homage to the pioneers of the genre, highlighting the links to jazz
musicians like Cab Calloway, funk artists like George Clinton and
spoken-word innovators like the Last Poets.
</P>
<P>
   ``They definitely kept it real,'' said Courtney E. Beatty, 26, a
warehouse foreman from Amityville who is a hip-hop MC and music
producer in his spare time. ``Especially where they went to the old
school, like Kurtis Blow and Grandmaster Flash. They took us back
to the roots, and that was cool.''
</P>
<P>
   There was also much debate about the kind of audience the
exhibition was intended to attract.
</P>
<P>
   Alex Reyes, a musician and graphic designer from Los Angeles who
goes by the name Sketch, said that the show was a primer on hip-hop
culture, touching on only its most basic aspects.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's oriented for a mainstream viewer _ who's popular now,
who's making money,'' he said. ``But I would have liked to see
alternative artists mentioned, people who really made an impact in
creating the culture.''
</P>
<P>
   But others who consider themselves mainstream viewers, like Jan
Girard, 54, a home furnishings designer from the Williamsburg
section of Brooklyn, said they thought that the exhibition was
created with hip-hop fans in mind.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm probably too old for this,'' she said. ``I think it was
more about people who are already familiar with it.'' Girard said
she took her friend and her friend's teen-age son to the museum
because it was one exhibition she knew the boy could tolerate.
</P>
<P>
   Roberto Resto, 19, a high school student from Williamsburg, was
thrilled to find an exhibition he could relate to. ``It's
definitely cool, because I've never seen anything like this in a
museum before,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   And Bett, who has designed several covers for rap albums in the
past, said he thought the subject matter was tame enough for his
children and unlikely to spawn the kind of conflict stirred last
year by ``Sensation,'' the Brooklyn Museum's exhibition of works by
young British artists that included animals suspended in
formaldehyde and an image of the Virgin Mary decorated with bits of
cow dung.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is trying to be very positive,'' he said. ``Hip-hop is so
deep, it's hard to get into all of it, and so much of it is still
underground. For mainstream hip-hop, it does a good job.''
</P>
<P>
   Yet the dearth of controversial material and the abundance of
commercial artifacts in the show upset some viewers. Miguel
Nogueres, 33, an art director for an advertising agency from the
Pelham Bay section of the Bronx, said he grew up in the Throgs Neck
public housing projects, where he had a front row seat on the
emergence of hip-hop culture in the 1970s.
</P>
<P>
   ``I guess it's not as intimidating now as it used to be,'' he
said. ``People thought it belonged to gangsters and drug dealers,
though it never really did. It was a form of expression, language
and art and dance. I don't really think clothing and photographs
will ever do it justice, because it's such a lively and energetic
form. This exhibit is like one color in the palette of hip-hop.''

 &HT;    SUPREME COURT DECLINES DIRECT APPEAL OF MICROSOFT CASE
 &HT;    680&AMP;add. Moving in (w) Washington and (f) financial categories.
 &HT;    By BRUCE HIGHT
 &HT;    c.2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Microsoft Corp. won a significant tactical victory
in its antitrust battle Tuesday when the U.S. Supreme Court
declined to take the Justice Department's case against the software
giant on direct appeal.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, the company's fight to keep from being split into two
independent units will now go to the U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals
for the District of Columbia, which has sided with Microsoft in
past rulings. Whoever loses there can still appeal to the Supreme
Court.
</P>
<P>
   The court's vote Tuesday was 8-1. Justice Stephen Breyer
dissented, saying that ``speed in reaching a final decision may
help create legal certainty.''
</P>
<P>
   The Supreme Court also refused to take up a related case against
Microsoft brought by 19 state attorneys general in support of the
Justice Department.
</P>
<P>
   The Court of Appeals moved quickly, acting on its own motion
Tuesday afternoon to order Microsoft to submit by Monday its
proposed schedule for handling the appeal. The court also said
Microsoft and the government could submit a joint proposal.
</P>
<P>
   ``We look forward to presenting our case to the court of appeals
as expeditiously as possible,'' said a Justice Department
spokeswoman, Gina Talamona.
</P>
<P>
   A Microsoft spokesman, Jim Cullinan, said the court's ruling
means the company will now ``get a chance to challenge what we
believe were a significant number of legal, factual and procedural
errors committed by the District Court which we think, in the end,
will result in this judgment being reversed.''
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft stock finished up 1 7/16 at $62 11/16 in trading
Tuesday on the NASDAQ stock exchange. Its 52-week high was $119
15/16, hit late last year.
</P>
<P>
   The Justice Department won a landmark victory this year when
U.S. District Judge Thomas Penfield Jackson ruled that Microsoft,
with annual revenues of about $23 billion, had illegally used its
market power to protect a monopoly on its Windows operating system
software for personal computers.
</P>
<P>
   At the government's urging, Jackson ordered the company divided
in two, with one taking Windows, the other getting applications
such as the Word processor and Excel database programs.
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft moved to appeal, but the Justice Department wanted to
skip the intermediate appeals court and go directly to the Supreme
Court.
</P>
<P>
   Although such a direct appeal is rare, the Justice Department
argued that ``the sooner a meaningful remedy is in place, the
better it will be for consumers and the marketplace by providing
increased innovation, more choices and better products.''
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft, however, argued for the usual route through the court
of appeals.
</P>
<P>
   William Kovacic, a professor of law at George Washington
University Law School who has tracked the case, said the high
court's refusal to hear the case on direct appeal means that the
chances that Microsoft will actually be broken up ``were
extinguished today.''
</P>
<P>
   The Court of Appeals will not vindicate Microsoft completely,
Kovacic predicted, but ``the government now has to run a very
demanding gantlet, and I don't think they'll pass through that
gantlet unscathed.''
</P>
<P>
   Kovacic said that as time passes, ``the logic of a breakup might
be far from apparent, as the industry itself changes.''
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, he said, the government case already has had an
impact, as seen in ``a somewhat chastened Microsoft, a somewhat
more emboldened group of competitors.''
</P>
<P>
   The high court's decision, announced without explanation, also
gives Microsoft more time to weigh the impact of two changes that
could affect its appeal: the presidential election and the
impending departure of Assistant Attorney General Joel Klein, the
Justice Department prosecutor who as head of the antitrust division
successfully pushed the government's case against Microsoft. Klein
leaves at the end of the week.
</P>
<P>
   Cullinan said the Supreme Court will benefit from the appeals
court's taking ``an initial review of this case to clear out that
legal and factual underbrush'' and focus on the most important
issues.
</P>
<P>
   (Story can end here. Optional add follows.)
</P>
<P>
   Neither of the major party presidential candidates, Vice
President Al Gore and Gov. George W. Bush of Texas, has said much
about antitrust issues, though some have theorized that Bush's more
pro-business record suggests he would be less interested in forcing
Microsoft to break up.
</P>
<P>
   However, Cullinan said the presidential election won't affect
the case because it ``is already in the appellate process. We think
that the issues are clear, and we think we are going to win on the
merits of our appeal. We believe wholeheartedly that this issue
will be decided in the court system.''
</P>
<P>
   Despite the rise in Microsoft's stock price Tuesday, some
experts said that the ruling may hurt the company because it
postpones the day when markets will know the company's likely
future standing.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think the marketplace, and the stock market in particular,
would like an earlier resolution of this case,'' said Steven Salop,
an economist who teaches antitrust law at Georgetown University Law
School. ``They wish Microsoft could just get the case behind it.
This means it's going to take longer.''
</P>
<P>
   In a step related to the court's Microsoft order Tuesday, Chief
Justice William H. Rehnquist said he would not stay out of the
Microsoft case despite his son's position as a partner in a Boston
law firm employed Microsoft in another case.
</P>
<P>
   ``My son's personal and financial concerns will not be affected
by our disposition of the Supreme Court's Microsoft matters,'' the
chief justice said.

<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ As the presidential campaign heats up, both major
candidates are offering what sound like ironclad guarantees that
Americans now getting Social Security and Medicare benefits and
those who'll soon qualify need fear no cuts whatsoever, and that no
new taxes will be necessary.
</P>
<P>
   But demographics, actuarial tables and economics say such
promises cannot be kept for succeeding generations.
</P>
<P>
   When the tidal wave of baby boomers rolls in, new taxes, benefit
cuts or massive federal borrowing will be necessary, experts say.
And when politicians and their policy advisers finish saving these
two entitlement programs, which cover every American, it's a good
bet that both will look quite different than they do today.
</P>
<P>
   For now, Democrat Al Gore and Republican George W. Bush have
made only cautious proposals in the direction the country will be
forced to go. Their rhetoric promises ``lock boxes'' to safeguard
the surpluses that both programs are generating for the moment. And
they back plans to pay down the national debt as a strategy for
``protecting and strengthening'' Social Security and Medicare in
the future.
</P>
<P>
   Beware.
</P>
<P>
   Voters are being offered ``lock-boxes'' much as they were once
offered ``trust funds,'' a concept they have been told they can no
longer trust. The ``lock-box'' is a law Congress would pass to
ensure that funds dedicated to Social Security and Medicare would
not be spent for any other purpose.
</P>
<P>
   And while paying down the national debt may be a good idea,
doing so could just as easily be described as a way of ``protecting
and strengthening'' national defense, education, farm programs or
any of the nation's other high-priority concerns.
</P>
<P>
   The dilemma facing Social Security and Medicare is not hard to
understand. Payroll taxes on today's workers support both retiree
programs. In 1950 there were seven workers to every retiree. By
2030, the ratio of workers to retirees will be less than three to
one.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; (FIRST OPTIONAL TRIM BEGINS) &LR;
</P>
<P>
   Social Security and Medicare, therefore, face real long-term
financing problems that unattended will build to crisis proportions
over time.
</P>
<P>
   These problems can be erased painlessly if the nation has a new
run of economic growth even longer and stronger than that of the
past eight years, a possibility that few reputable economists are
forecasting.
</P>
<P>
   Nor would currently imagined budget surpluses be sufficient to
balance the books. Medicare, Social Security and the appetite for
increased spending on defense and other national needs will devour
them.
</P>
<P>
   ``Under the most plausible long-term scenarios, the government
faces an annual fiscal deficit, not a surplus,'' economists Alan J.
Auerbach of the University of California, Berkeley, and William G.
Gale of the Brookings Institution declare in a recent report. As a
result, they warn, the ``current frenzy of proposals for allocating
the surplus to additional spending and tax cuts is misplaced.''
</P>
<P>
   &UR; (FIRST OPTIONAL TRIM ENDS) &LR;
</P>
<P>
   If the president elected in November gets two terms, he will
leave office just as the baby boomers start to retire. The big
fiscal challenge will be finding ways to pay their Social Security
and Medicare benefits during their lengthening life expectancies.
</P>
<P>
   Experts say Social Security is the less difficult problem to
solve, requiring only small increases in taxes, raising the
retirement age slightly and reducing benefits a touch _ providing
that these things are done soon.
</P>
<P>
   But neither Gore nor Bush proposes this. Instead, both
candidates would sweeten the retirement packages for seniors.
</P>
<P>
   Gore would rely on surpluses that may not materialize, and Bush
would rely on private profits that may not materialize.
</P>
<P>
   Both postpone tough decisions about higher taxes, benefit cuts
or new deficit spending that will have to be made later.
</P>
<P>
   Gore acknowledges Social Security's double-barreled problem:
Retirees will claim an increasing share of gross domestic product,
and payroll taxes will be inadequate to finance the present benefit
structure.
</P>
<P>
   Alan Blinder, Gore's economic adviser, says that both can be
solved ``without doing what I certainly thought four years ago was
going to be necessary: cutbacks in benefits or a higher payroll
tax.''
</P>
<P>
   Using current budget surpluses to pay down the debt should lead
to lower interest rates, more business investment and faster
productivity growth, he said. ``With a bigger pie you can pick out
a bigger slice for seniors, and if the pie can grow fast enough,
there won't be any pain at all,'' Blinder said.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, Gore intends to credit the Social Security trust fund
with the money the government saves in interest on the national
debt, thereby eliminating half _ but only half _ of the program's
projected fiscal shortfall. And while this accounting device makes
the books look better, it does not actually set aside the money
that will be needed to pay benefits. For that, the government would
still eventually have to divert money from other programs, raise
taxes or borrow.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, Gore would raise benefits for mothers, widows and
widowers.
</P>
<P>
   Parents would be eligible for credit toward Social Security for
as long as five years spent raising children, if during that time
they could work only part time or not at all. The child-raising
years would be counted as if the caregiver had earned one-half the
average national wage over the period.
</P>
<P>
   Eliminating the so-called motherhood penalty would provide an
average additional benefit of $600 annually to 8 million Americans,
mostly women.
</P>
<P>
   Gore also proposes to raise the widow/widower benefit to 75
percent of the combined couple's benefit, capped at the average
Social Security retirement benefit. More than 3 million widows and
widowers would see their benefits rise by as much as $4,100
annually under Gore's plan.
</P>
<P>
   On top of that, Gore seeks to match and even surpass Bush's
promises of greater wealth for all retirees by creating a new
program to subsidize personal investment savings accounts, so that
families may build tax-free nest eggs to supplement Social Security
benefits.
</P>
<P>
   Under Gore's plan, ``Retirement Savings Plus,'' a married couple
earning up to $30,000 could put $500 a year from each spouse into a
special private account. The federal government would add $1,500
per spouse, for a total of $4,000.
</P>
<P>
   Couples earning between $30,000 and $60,000 would get a maximum
$1,000 per person; those earning up to $100,000 would get $500 per
person.
</P>
<P>
   Bush's Social Security solution envisions a major change in the
program's structure, allowing younger workers to invest an
unspecified portion of their Social Security payroll taxes in
private accounts.
</P>
<P>
   In the stock market, this money will earn a higher rate of
return and generate wealth, Bush predicts. It also presumably
cushions against future reductions in Social Security benefits,
although Bush does not indicate whether he would propose such cuts.
</P>
<P>
   This is an approach favored by many Democrats as well as
Republicans. But unanswered is how Bush would protect checks
flowing to current retirees if taxes on younger workers, which now
support those benefits, are diverted to private retirement
accounts.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, Bush's plan is far less defined than Gore's, and that is
no accident, said Lawrence Lindsay, Bush's chief policy adviser.
</P>
<P>
   ``People say, why don't we spell out the exact program we are
going to enact? The answer is straightforward. If you did, it
wouldn't be enacted,'' Lindsay said.
</P>
<P>
   Savvy operators get things done differently in Washington, he
says.
</P>
<P>
   ``What you do is come to town as flexible as possible with a
mandate to do something,'' Lindsay said.
</P>
<P>
   Then you set up a bipartisan commission: ``You get the relevant
players in a room and you take away the key to the bathroom until
they get their heads together and come up with a plan.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush, Lindsay said, would go into such negotiations pushing six
principles:
</P>
<P>
   _ No changes in benefits for retirees and near-retirees.
</P>
<P>
   _ Current Social Security tax surpluses must be protected by a
lock box.
</P>
<P>
   _ Social Security payroll taxes must not be increased.
</P>
<P>
   _ The government itself must not invest Social Security funds in
the stock market.
</P>
<P>
   _ Modernization must preserve the Social Security disability and
survivors' benefit programs.
</P>
<P>
   _ Modernization must include individually controlled voluntary
personal retirement accounts.
</P>
<P>
   The plans offered by Gore and Bush have disappointed many
objective policy analysts, like the bipartisan Concord Coalition,
which has sounded alarms for several years about the fiscal train
wreck awaiting Social Security.
</P>
<P>
   ``What we are left with is a choice between two free lunch
proposals,'' the Concord Coalition reported recently. ``That kind
of political debate, which rules out changes in current benefit
promises or tax rates, is perhaps worse than no debate at all
because it locks the new president into an indefensible position.
The window of opportunity for phased-in modest changes is beginning
to slide shut.''
</P>
<P>
   Even more imposing are Medicare's problems.
</P>
<P>
   Today, Medicare serves 39 million beneficiaries, everyone over
65 and many disabled. Those numbers will more than double to 80
million as the boomers retire. As with Social Security, there will
be relatively fewer workers paying taxes to support the program.
</P>
<P>
   Medicare's financing is more daunting given the rising cost of
health care itself, the result of both inflation and medical
advances that generate new, better and often more expensive
treatments.
</P>
<P>
   Gore and Bush offer dramatically different solutions.
</P>
<P>
   Both would add benefits for seniors, including prescription drug
coverage not now available under Medicare.
</P>
<P>
   Gore's plan would expand the 35-year-old government-run Medicare
program by adding prescription drugs to its standard benefits,
requiring most _ but not the poorest _ beneficiaries to pay a $25
monthly premium.
</P>
<P>
   The drug benefit would pay half the cost of all prescriptions up
to $5,000. Beneficiaries would be solely responsible for the next
$1,500 in costs, but 100 percent of prescriptions after that would
be government-paid.
</P>
<P>
   Gore also proposes to reinforce Medicare financing with
accounting devices that he claims would extend the solvency of the
Medicare trust fund to 2030, after which further adjustments would
be necessary.
</P>
<P>
   Bush would overhaul Medicare, encouraging seniors to shift from
the government program to subsidized private health insurance plans
that include drug coverage. Seniors could elect to remain in
traditional Medicare, with the option of buying a subsidized
prescription drug plan. Those choosing to leave Medicare would get
subsidies to buy government-approved private health insurance that
would vary in costs and benefits. The elderly themselves would pay
extra for more generous benefit packages if they so desired.
</P>
<P>
   Bush also promises to cover the full cost of drug coverage for
the low-income elderly, and add an entirely new and important
benefit for all seniors. Bush would have the government pay for all
catastrophic medical expenses, defined as those costs above $6,000
a year.
</P>
<P>
   Since Bush believes his changes will take several years, he
would set up a temporary program giving states $48 billion in
grants for immediate needs _ to subsidize prescription drug
coverage for the low-income elderly and those with unusually large
drug bills.
</P>
<P>
   But neither Bush nor Gore offers a reliable solution to
Medicare's long-term financing problem.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; (SECOND OPTIONAL TRIM FOLLOWS) &LR;
</P>
<P>
   The Bush plan raises twin problems that ``we don't know yet how
to solve,'' said Henry Aaron, an economist at the Brookings
Institution.
</P>
<P>
   By giving people funds to buy private health insurance and
telling them that if they want a more expensive plan they must pay
for it themselves, Bush encourages them to shop for economy, Aaron
said. Insurers, however, would have a powerful incentive to
``cherry pick,'' enrolling only the healthiest, lower-cost
beneficiaries, Aaron said. To offset that consequence, policymakers
must find a way to make payments to insurance companies vary with
the risks. ``But we don't know how to do that,'' Aaron said.
</P>
<P>
   A second problem with the Bush plan, Aaron warned, is that many
seniors may not be able to handle the aggressive sales techniques
of private insurers or process complete information about alternate
benefit packages. ``We would need a regulated market to assist
people in making intelligent decisions,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   In Aaron's view, the Gore plan has its own defects, the worst
being that it ducks the problem of long-term financing.
</P>
<P>
   Estimates of that deficit have been volatile in recent years.
Today's projection is two-thirds smaller than it was three years
ago as a result of cutbacks in payments to health care providers,
the strong economy and easing in the growth of health care costs.
</P>
<P>
   ``All that could turn around,'' Aaron said. ``The fact is that
Medicare is inadequate insurance, and making it adequate is going
to cost more. Eventually we have got to find more money either by
raising the payroll tax, or more general revenue transfers.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are not in the end going to walk away from Medicare and
therefore there will be some painful choices made down the road.
It's not the sort of thing we want to talk about, but it's the
truth.''

AT CORDIAL DINNER PARTY, ARAFAT AND BARAK REGAIN MOMENTUM FOR
PEACE 
</HEADLINE>
   By DEBORAH SONTAG    
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   RAMALLAH, West Bank _ It was just a little suburban dinner
party, nothing fancy. The host and his guest of honor cracked
jokes. They strolled in the garden for an intimate chat. And then
the host kissed his guest goodbye, walked him to a waiting Israeli
military helicopter and waved as the guest, wearing his trademark
kaffiyeh, flew back to Gaza City.
</P>
<P>
   A senior adviser to Yasser Arafat said the late-night supper, at
Prime Minister Ehud Barak's private home in Kochav Yair on Monday,
was the single best meeting ever between the Palestinian and
Israeli leaders.
</P>
<P>
   The adviser, Nabil Shaath, said Tuesday that it had been ``very
cordial,'' even congenial. He noted that the two men had walked
together to the balcony twice _ ``and both came back.''
</P>
<P>
   Similarly, Barak said the evening had been ``warm and open.''
</P>
<P>
   How did the two leaders move from tense, strained relations to
hugs in a single evening? Only their advisers know. Has improved
chemistry shortened the distance from a deadlock to a permanent
peace treaty? Probably not.
</P>
<P>
   Nothing substantive was discussed.
</P>
<P>
   But Tuesday both sides were willing to declare fresh momentum
and, as their negotiators were landing in the United States, to
move forward once more into yet another ``decisive'' phase of
peacemaking.
</P>
<P>
   ``Yesterday, in my home in Kochav Yair,'' Barak said Tuesday,
``we met with Arafat and the entire Palestinian leadership for a
warm, open meeting that I believe will help us in our efforts to
renew the negotiations. I would say that we are at the entrance to
a very intensive effort and, in a way, to the last effort in this
round to reach a breakthrough.''
</P>
<P>
   Such an intimate meeting between Arafat, once Israel's mortal
enemy, and an Israeli leader would have been unthinkable just years
ago. Arafat only made one previous visit to an Israeli prime
minister's home, and that was to pay condolences to the family of
Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin after he was assassinated by a Jewish
extremist in 1995.
</P>
<P>
   Shaath said the Kochav Yair meeting had been engineered by an
American Jewish businessman, S. Daniel Abraham. Abraham, founder of
the Slim-Fast Food Companies, is a leading contributor to the
Democratic Party's election campaigns this year and a backer of
Israeli-Arab peace efforts through the Washington-based Center for
Middle East Peace and Economic Cooperation, which he co-founded.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   And shortly before Arafat flew off to see Barak, the Palestinian
leader met with a separate contingent of 15 American Jewish leaders
in Gaza City. Michael Sonnenfeldt, chairman of the dovish Israel
Policy Forum, said the Americans had visited Arafat to declare that
American Jews were probably more centrist than he imagined, and
willing to support both sides in the peace effort.
</P>
<P>
   ``We told him that the American Jewish community, which is
committed to Israel's longterm security, understands that a peace
agreement will bring security in region only if a Palestinian state
takes hold,'' Sonnenfeldt said.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   While Barak and Arafat made an effort at developing a
relationship last fall and earlier this year, they never clicked.
Since the Camp David peace talks ended two months ago, they have
not communicated directly, although they did shake hands at the
United Nations gathering of world leaders earlier this month.
</P>
<P>
   The 15-day meeting at Camp David, presided over by President
Clinton, did not produce a permanent peace accord to end 52 years
of bitter conflict, as planned. But it provoked substantive debate
on all of the issues and something close to a meeting of the minds
on the key issues of territorial division, water resources and
security cooperation.
</P>
<P>
   After Camp David, though, both sides say the momentum evaporated
and they lost ground on those issues. In a rare news conference by
a senior Palestinian official Tuesday, Shaath, the minister of
planning and international cooperation, blamed the Israelis for
focusing too much on the most difficult issue, the future status of
the holy site known to Jews as the Temple Mount and to Muslims as
Haram al Sharif.
</P>
<P>
   ``We can live without turning our feuds into religious issues,''
he said. ``And the stalemate cannot be broken if we just
concentrate on Haram al Sharif. It wouldn't be at all bad if
instead where we are close we made things closer. Trust would be
created if on five to seven issues we could measure some
progress.''
</P>
<P>
   In Washington, Israeli and Palestinian negotiators are to meet
separately with American mediators to review a bridging proposal
that seeks to reconcile conflicting demands on all of the key
issues on the negotiating table.
</P>
<P>
   Shaath said President Clinton first reviewed a final copy of the
document on Friday and suggested summoning the parties to review it
rather than making it public, to the risk of provoking further
discord.
</P>
<P>
   ``The man is agonizing over it,'' Shaath said, referring to
Clinton, ``because he doesn't want another failure.''
</P>
<P>
   The Palestinians do not feel the same sense of urgency as Barak,
who will face a possible dissolution of his minority government
when the Israeli Parliament reconvenes at the end of October.
</P>
<P>
   Shaath said Barak could find a way to reconstitute his
coalition. He also said the Palestinians thought that there were
advantages to dealing with a ``lame duck'' American president after
the November elections.
</P>
<P>
   The Palestinians will not be setting any new dates for a
declaration of Palestinian statehood after two deadlines were
broken, Shaath said.
</P>
<P>
   If no agreement can be reached this fall, he said, the
Palestinians will ask the Israelis to fulfill their unfulfilled
commitments under the most recent interim agreement _ for example,
another land transfer _ ``to create a safety net and prevent
confrontation.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The Israelis are trying to create a mental picture of
Palestinians like croupiers at a casino pocketing all the chips and
not giving anything in return,'' he said. ``I think the giving has
already happened.
</P>
<P>
   ``Israel has had a great two years'' because of
Israeli-Palestinian security cooperation that has reduced
terrorism, he said.

SELES SATISFIED WITH THE BRONZE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By BUD COLLINS  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   SYDNEY _ The medal will be bronze, and that is just fine with
Monica Seles.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've never had a medal in my life, and I had to fight hard for
it. I'm just happy that I won a medal.''
</P>
<P>
   After turning down two Olympics, and faltering in another, Seles
got her medal by beating the raw, gloomy weather plus 10,000 folks
who wanted her to lose because she was in the paved rectangle with
one of them _ Aussie Jelena Dokic, 6-1, 6-4.
</P>
<P>
   It could be zinc rather than bronze, and Seles would be just as
happy because ``I take nothing for granted since the stabbing.''
There was something about the dastardly Guenther Parche plunging a
knife into her back seven years ago that makes Seles fully
appreciate everything that comes her way.
</P>
<P>
   Tuesday it was a bronze medal, the prize for winning a playoff
with the much-admired ingenue, Dokic, a townie, and the youngest
kid on the Olympic tennis block at Homebush. They were losing
semifinalists, Dokic to the Russian, Elena Dementieva.
</P>
<P>
   After Seles took her best shot at Venus Williams and gold _
close, but no succor _ she was ``really down. I didn't even know
about the playoff thing, and when I found out about it I didn't
want to play at all. That's how depressed I was.
</P>
<P>
   ``But a nice thing happened. My good friend Mary Joe Fernandez
phoned me from the US, and she told me how fantastic it would be to
win a bronze. She won one at Barcelona in 1992. That kind of got me
going. I said, OK, I'm really going to come back and fight for
this. You know, to get all the way from a chance at gold to have
the bronze is good.''
</P>
<P>
   Seles knew she'd have to go for a quick kill. Giving away nine
years and a Dokic-supporting cast of 10,000 voices, she was still
tinged with weariness, emotional as well as physical, from her 6-1,
4-6, 6-3, civil war 24 hours before against Williams.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was so difficult mentally to play against a teammate. But
it was tough with the crowd and Jelena.''
</P>
<P>
   Venus and Serena Williams won their doubles semifinal by beating
Els Callens and Dominique Van Roost of Belgium, 6-4, 6-1. Their
opponents in the final Thursday will be Kristie Boogert and Miriam
Oremans of the Netherlands.
</P>
<P>
   ``Winning a gold medal would be a fantastic thing for sure,''
Serena said.
</P>
<P>
   Though the good burghers of Sydney filling the silver oval
stadium Tuesday weren't hostile, they were homers of a
high-decibelic order. Their men _ Patrick Rafter, Lleyton Hewitt,
Mark Philippoussis _ had been as big a bust in singles as the lower
quality American guys, but now their girl could be a 17-year-old
heroine cast in bronze.
</P>
<P>
   Their cheers went only to her, whether Dokic made a point on a
Seles error or her own merit. Seles sometimes heard her coaches,
Billie Jean King and Zina Garrison, yelling encouragement through
the tumult, but it was her job to mute the mob as often as
possible.
</P>
<P>
   She was swift about it, as she needed to be: 56 minutes. Off the
blocks like Marion Jones, Seles darted hither and yon, firing her
double-barrelled groundies zestfully from both sides to stun the
kid by taking the first nine points, and a 3-0 lead.
</P>
<P>
   Dokic, a slight but whippy blonde, is, however, a fighter, too.
She rebounded in the second _ and with her the patrons _ as she
bottled Seles at 4-4. There a double fault to 15-30, an opening the
canny old pro used well. She'd been through so much, and knew what
to do. She'd been a better 17-year-old than Dokic _ probably better
than anyone else ever of that age, holder of four major titles
before her 18th birthday.
</P>
<P>
   Seles jerked Dokic from sideline to sideline, squeezing mistakes
from her to dash ahead, 5-4, then 30-0. Dokic, undaunted, countered
with a drop shot and won a long rally. Thirty-all. Seles was tired.
She couldn't lose this game. A third set was unthinkable.
</P>
<P>
   There were only two things to do. Don't let Dokic hit another
ball or a vocal spectator hit another high note. She had never
ended a match in the big league like this _ perfect knockout
swings. But Seles, narrowing her vivid blue eyes, went for it. She
raised her left arm and cranked an ace, kicking it wide beyond
Dokic's forehand. It felt so good that she did it again. Curling
the ball out of reach, Seles had hooked her bronze.
</P>
<P>
   Silence. Then the respectful, sporting applause that she
deserved from the 10,000.
</P>
<P>
   They shook hands. A portrait of two kids born in the Balkans _
the crumbling Yugoslavia _ whose perceptive fathers, the kindly
Karolj Seles and the erratic Damir Dokic, had spirited them off to
better places to grow: Monica to the US, Jelena to Australia.
</P>
<P>
   At 14, then 18 after settling in Florida, Seles was invited to
represent Yugoslavia in the Olympics.
</P>
<P>
   ``At that time I felt that tennis didn't belong in the Olympics.
But,'' Seles says, ``by 1996 I was a US citizen, and my father
thought it would be wonderful to represent my new country. I could
see he was right. It is such an honor, one of the few times you get
to do that.''
</P>
<P>
   She went to Atlanta, the favorite, only to lose in the quarters
to Czech Jana Novotna, who seized the bronze.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wanted to be on that victory stand. Now I will, along with
Venus who, hopefully, will win the gold.''
</P>
<P>
   Bronze, worked by artists as noteworthy as Rodin, comes in all
shapes, sizes, and prices. Seles is a rich woman, but the small
disc is all the more precious because it cannot be purchased _
except with sweat, heart, and skill.

   (UNDATED) There's no war to protest. The economy is chugging.
There's no national strife to mobilize the masses.
</P>
<P>
   For the most part, the country's youngest eligible voters have
known only prosperity. They haven't lived through wartime drafts,
crippling economic depression or widespread blatant discrimination
against women and minority groups.
</P>
<P>
   And, for the most part, they don't vote.
</P>
<P>
   Numerous recent studies show that people younger than 30
generally don't care about casting their ballots. They don't see
why it's important or what difference it makes.
</P>
<P>
   But organizations that promote voting are beginning to craft
creative ways to capture their interest.
</P>
<P>
   The flashier programs say that voting is not only the right
thing to do, it's the cool thing to do. Cable's pioneering music
video channel MTV is urging its viewers to ``Choose or Lose.'' With
trademark shouting and muscle, the World Wrestling Federation is
pushing fans to ``Smackdown Your Vote!''
</P>
<P>
   And despite documented cynicism among young voters, some states,
including California, Florida, Massachusetts, Minnesota and Oregon,
have entertained lowering the voting age from 18 to as young as 12.
</P>
<P>
   While turnout in the United States is down overall _ less than
half the country's eligible voters went to the polls in the 1996
presidential election _ it's lowest within the youngest group. Four
years ago, 32 percent of 18- to 24-year-olds voted, according to
census figures. More than twice that share, 67 percent, of people
65 and older voted.
</P>
<P>
   The common explanation for the difference is that people develop
more interest in voting as they settle down, buy homes and raise
families.
</P>
<P>
   ``Older voters have always shown up more; that's nothing new,''
said Andrew Kohut, director of the Pew Research Center for the
People &AMP; the Press. ``What's happening is the gap is getting wider
and wider.''
</P>
<P>
   This summer the Pew Center issued a report saying people younger
than 30 don't vote because they're adverse to politics and don't
think it matters who's president.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have other things on our minds,'' Sara DiFiore, an
18-year-old from Whiting, Ind., said at a recent WWF event. ``I
don't really think about whoever's president. Whoever wins, wins.''
</P>
<P>
   That attitude is common among a generation that grew up with the
overwhelming offerings of cable TV and the Internet, said Thomas
Patterson, a principal investigator with the Vanishing Voter
Project at Harvard University.
</P>
<P>
   The project reported that almost three times as many people ages
18 to 29 knew who won this year's Super Bowl than who won the
highly publicized New Hampshire Republican primary.
</P>
<P>
   ``This generation is very much tied into the media. There's no
question about that,'' Patterson said. ``What they're not tied into
is the news media.''
</P>
<P>
   As young people's interest in politics has waned, several
organizations are aiming to make voting feel as natural as turning
on the television. The philosophy is: Get them while they're young
_ real young.
</P>
<P>
   Kids Voting USA, based in Tempe, Ariz., offers a curriculum to
teach children as young as kindergartners about informed voting.
Schools across the country, including those in Springfield, Mass.,
Newark, N.J., and Saginaw, Mich., use the program, which includes
mock elections and classroom discussions on civics.
</P>
<P>
   ``They'll vote for things like ice cream and recess. Who
wouldn't want to have ice cream and recess?'' said Paula Case, a
Kids Voting USA project manager. ``But then they find out it's `no
recess' and `garlic ice cream' and learn why research is
important.''
</P>
<P>
   Kids Voting USA even sets up cardboard voting booths at official
polling sites so children can vote alongside their parents. ``The
reason to start so young is so the voting place becomes a familiar
place, not a scary place, so voting becomes a habit,'' Case said.
</P>
<P>
   The Internet is helping to spread the word.
</P>
<P>
   Across the country, state legislatures have put up Web pages in
simple language to teach children about government. Youth-e-Vote
allows students to vote a week before the election for president,
governor and policy issues. And the Council for Excellence in
Government and its partners are promoting a ``Take Your Kids to
Vote'' campaign, suggesting activities for children and parents
counting down to the election.
</P>
<P>
   During every presidential election since 1992, MTV has peppered
the music of the day with its ``Choose or Lose'' series. This year,
four people in their 20s are traveling the country for MTV, talking
to young people about voting.
</P>
<P>
   Erica Terry, 27, one of the ``Choose or Lose'' correspondents,
said young people feel the presidential candidates don't address
them in their speeches or promises.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's really hard for the kids to see the connection between
what's going on in their day-to-day lives and the larger picture,''
she said.
</P>
<P>
   On Monday, MTV and the Kaiser Family Foundation released
``Youth, Voting and the 2000 Election,'' a report based on a survey
of 800 18- to 24-year-olds. The report said that while at least
three out of four young people surveyed supported restrictions on
gun buying, funding for sex education in schools and helping the
uninsured receive health coverage, just 46 percent said they
planned to vote. The top explanations: They didn't know enough
about the candidates; they felt they could have more impact being
involved in their communities than by voting; and they felt
politics was ``all about money and lying.''
</P>
<P>
   On Tuesday, Democratic presidential nominee Al Gore answered
questions from young people at a ``Choose or Lose'' forum taped in
Ann Arbor, Mich. Republican candidate George W. Bush has not yet
accepted MTV's invitation to appear.
</P>
<P>
   The World Wrestling Federation hoisted the youth voting banner
in August, kicking off ``Smackdown Your Vote!'' with a nonpartisan
coalition called Youth Vote 2000. Two of the WWF's most recognized
wrestlers, the Rock and Chyna, made saucy appearances at the
national conventions in August. Later that month, the WWF announced
that it had registered about 40,000 people during the voting
drive's first three weeks.
</P>
<P>
   At a September WWF event in Rosemont, Ill., a Chicago suburb,
young fans crowded around a table with voting and registration
information.
</P>
<P>
   Leaning against a concrete wall in the arena, Erich Zilai of
Chicago pressed a pen to a blank registration form, turned to his
friend and said, ``'Cause the Rock told me to, I've got to vote
now.''
</P>
<P>
   He wasn't kidding.
</P>
<P>
   The 20-year-old hard-core wrestling fan said he wouldn't have
registered if his favorite wrestler hadn't told him to and if the
WWF hadn't made it easy.
</P>
<P>
   ``The candidates aren't speaking to me or other young people,''
Zilai said. ``I didn't think it was important before to vote, but
the Rock convinced me.''
</P>
<P>
   Another Rock admirer, Donnita Hathaway, 24, of Chicago, said she
had registered before but didn't feel moved to vote for president
in 1996.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's important to me now, now that I'm paying taxes, thinking
about raising a family,'' she said. ``I hate to say this, but kids
are young and dumb. I was. But now that I'm older, it just makes
sense for me to vote.''
</P>
<P>
   Several eager fans who ran up to the table walked away dejected
when they learned they weren't old enough to vote.
</P>
<P>
   Those young wannabe-voters have supporters. The past decade has
seen several proposals to lower the voting age at the local, state
and federal levels.
</P>
<P>
   The voting age was 21 until 1971. A constitutional amendment to
lower the age to 18 came amid protests of the Vietnam War;
18-year-olds could be drafted to fight but could not vote. In
1972's presidential election, the first with the younger voting
age, 50 percent of 18- to 24-year-olds voted. Participation in that
age group has dropped every presidential election year since.
</P>
<P>
   Efforts to lower the age even further all have fizzled.
</P>
<P>
   Minnesota State Rep. Phyllis Kahn, a Democrat who has pushed a
younger age for nearly 10 years, said she wanted to spark
discussion about young people and voting. In 1991, she suggested
reducing the age to 12, choosing that age because government
pamphlets are written at the reading level of a 12-year-old.
</P>
<P>
   ``I got an enormous amount of attention, including a lot of
ridicule, but a fantastic interest from kids,'' Kahn said.
</P>
<P>
   Kahn now suggests a voting age of 16. ``We let our kids drive
when they're 16, when an irresponsible driver can do much more harm
than an irresponsible voter,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Jim Fouts, a councilman from Warren, Mich., tried to lower the
voting age to 17 for the 1999 city election. His fellow council
members didn't buy it.
</P>
<P>
   Fouts, who teaches government at Sterling Heights High School,
said young people need to feel included in the election process and
warned that their cynicism was simmering.
</P>
<P>
   ``Students pick up on the phoniness,'' he said. ``They think
Bush and Gore will say anything it takes to get elected, but they
are making decisions today that will affect them for decades to
come.''
</P>
<P>
   Americans for a Society Free From Age Restrictions, a national
youth-driven advocacy group, supports a younger voting age. After
all, members say, young people pay taxes, are citizens and should
have a say in their government.
</P>
<P>
   The group's president, Eric Anderson, a 21-year-old from St.
Louis, said age doesn't determine an informed voter: ``There are
people over 18 who don't know what they're doing.''
</P>
<P>
   &UR; (OPTIONAL TRIM FOLLOWS) &LR;
</P>
<P>
   Young people don't vote because ``there's a feeling out there
that we're choosing between the lesser of two evils,'' he said.
``But there are alternate parties young people should know about.''
</P>
<P>
   Take Minnesota Gov. Jesse Ventura, for example. In 1998, he
campaigned as a member of the Reform Party like a rock star _
pumping music and gritty slogans during campaign stops. Young
people rallied around him, and he has credited their support for
helping him win.
</P>
<P>
   Known during his wrestling days as Jesse ``The Body'' Ventura,
he has agreed to moderate the ``Smackdown Challenge,'' a debate in
which the World Wrestling Federation has urged the Democratic and
Republican candidates to participate.
</P>
<P>
   But whatever the tactic employed to get young people to vote,
experts looking at the numbers say the turnout is likely to slump
until some national issue inspires action.
</P>
<P>
   ``All of these things help, but to be honest with you, I think
large societal forces change these things,'' said Kohut, of the Pew
Center. ``It's going to take changes in our national condition to
change these attitudes. It will happen. The economy is not going to
keep on rocking. Things won't be sedate all the time.''

&HT;     RIVALS BATTLE OVER ISSUES AND HIT TALK SHOWS  
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)   
 &HT;     By STEWART M. POWELL   
 &HT;     c.2000 Hearst Newspapers   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Republican George W. Bush and Democrat Al Gore clashed Tuesday
over rival plans to strengthen education and overhaul Medicare
before limbering up for the opening presidential debate with
televised question-and-answer sessions.
</P>
<P>
   Bush pressed his claim of an ``education recession'' during the
Clinton-Gore years, at an appearance at a public school in Redwood
City, Calif., adjacent to Silicon Valley before joining his wife,
Laura, for a scheduled appearance on CNN's Larry King Live
interview talk show.
</P>
<P>
   Gore challenged Bush on education during an appearance at Wayne
State University in Detroit, and spotlighted differences with Bush
over rival blueprints to overhaul Medicare, the federally
subsidized health care coverage that benefits nearly 40 million
elderly and disabled Americans.
</P>
<P>
   Gore later fielded questions from young people invited to the
Music Television network's ``Choose or Lose 2000'' program, a town
hall-style question-and-answer session.
</P>
<P>
   The candidates worked the campaign trail as the bipartisan
Commission on Presidential Debates, host of every presidential
campaign debate since 1988, prepared to announce that the first
debate on Oct. 3 will include only Bush and Gore.
</P>
<P>
   Commission chairs Paul Kirk and Frank Fahrenkopf said
third-party candidates such as the Green Party's Ralph Nader and
the Reform Party's Pat Buchanan would be invited to attend only if
they had garnered the support of 15 percent of the voters in the
six nationwide surveys used to determine admission to the
nationally televised debates. Nader and Buchanan remained in single
digits in recent polls.
</P>
<P>
   The last time a third-party candidate won admission was in 1992
when Texas billionaire Ross Perot, with public support as high as
30 percent, joined President Bush and then-Arkansas Gov. Bill
Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   This week, nationwide surveys showed Bush retaining a slight
edge over Gore in the popular vote, with his margin ranging from 2
percentage points to 6 percentage points.
</P>
<P>
   Gore led in the state-by-state battle for electoral votes, with
public opinion polls giving him the edge in 26 states with 307
electoral votes. Bush led in 22 states with 180 electoral votes,
according to the daily summary maintained by the National Journal's
Hotline political newsletter.
</P>
<P>
   A candidate needs to win enough states to capture 270 electoral
votes to win the White House.
</P>
<P>
   On the campaign trail in California, Bush told 200 teachers,
students and supporters at a high school that his $48-billion,
10-year plan could bolster literacy, provide college scholarships
and help states create and implement standards to judge public
schools' annual performance. Parents of children at failing schools
would get $1,500 per child per year to pay for other schooling.
</P>
<P>
   ``I believe there are better days ahead for America _ and it
starts with making sure every kid gets educated in America,'' Bush
said. Citing statistics showing U.S. students' test scores trailing
many other industrialized democracies, Bush said that ``if America
doesn't lead the world in math and science, the next generation may
not lead the world.''
</P>
<P>
   Gore belittled Bush's education plan, saying the Texan's
proposed overhaul would give parents of children attending failing
public schools ``little tiny bits (of money) _ not nearly enough to
pay the tuition at a private school.''
</P>
<P>
   Gore said his 10-year, $115-billion education blueprint would
renovate crumbling schools, cut class size, hire 100,000 new
teachers and bring in new principals and ``turnaround'' teams at
troubled schools.
</P>
<P>
   The vice president continued to showcase disagreements with Bush
over Medicare a day after he reminded voters that Bush had
supported the proposed $270-billion cut to Medicare fashioned by
then-House Speaker Newt Gingrich, R-Ga. President Clinton twice
vetoed the GOP-backed measure before accepting a compromise $112
billion plan to cutback Medicare as part of a deal that balanced
the federal budget for the first time since 1969.
</P>
<P>
   Gore contrasted his proposed $338-billion overhaul of the
middle-class entitlement and his plan to protect the program's
projected 10-year, $360-billion surplus with Bush's plan for a tax
cut.
</P>
<P>
   The vice president, mindful that the Clinton-Gore ticket had
rallied young voter turnout to win in 1992, tried to revive
interest among 18 to 24 year olds during the taped 90-minute MTV
town hall meeting at the University of Michigan in Ann Arbor.
</P>
<P>
   Gore offered vivid warnings that next president will have the
opportunity to fill as many as four seats on the U.S. Supreme Court
that are expected to open up in the next four years.
</P>
<P>
   Gore, dressed in an open olive-colored shirt, told the invited
guests that the high court jurists will interpret the Constitution
``for the next 30 or 40 years _ until you're my age,'' adding:
``You have a lot riding on whether or not civil rights, equal
rights, women's rights are protected in the philosophical choices
made by the next president.''
</P>
<P>
   The MTV video introduction of Gore said, in part: ``He listened
to rock, rode a motorcycle and even smoked the herb.''
</P>
<P>
   Gore has said in the past that he occasionally smoked marijuana
in his younger days.
</P>
<P>
   Bush has been invited to make a similar appearance but has not
yet accepted, an MTV spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
   A recent poll for MTV found that only 46 percent of Americans
aged 18 to 24 said they planned to vote on Nov. 7 _ compared to 64
percent of older Americans.
</P>
<P>
   The MTV website featured a click-and-vote poll offering
respondents a chance to answer the question: ``Al Gore most reminds
me of? The choices included: ``My high school guidance counselor;
my Dad; the captain of my school's debate team; a traveling
salesman; or other.''
</P>
<P>
   To bolster their barnstorming, Bush and Gore launched competing
campaign ads. Bush's ad said that 58 percent of 4th grade students
in the nation's low-income schools ``can't read,'' calling that
evidence of ``an education recession in America.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush, the 54-year-old second term governor of Texas told voters
in the ad that ``if we really want to make sure no child gets left
behind in America, we need the courage to raise standards.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush's ad builds upon an campaign ad being aired in 17 states by
the Republican party.
</P>
<P>
   Gore hit the television airwaves as well with a new 30-second
advertisement entitled ``Veteran'' that highlights the 52-year-old
Tennessean's service in Vietnam and his devotion to his wife of 30
years and his four children. The ad cites Gore's support to a tax
break for college tuition, welfare reform, a crime victims' bill of
rights and protecting children from violence ant the Internet,
added: ``Al Gore, he'll put his values to work for us.''

well.
</P>
<P>
   __ GOP running mate Dick Cheney said in Troy, Mich., that Gore
had ``failed to speak the truth'' on a variety of subjects _
particularly by offering ``distorted and demagogic''
characterizations of Bush proposal to provide prescription drug
coverage to senior citizens. Cheney's latest attack followed his
criticism of Gore on Monday for an alleged conflict of interest
because the vice president had favored continuing a moratorium on
royalties that U.S. companies pay to drill for natural gas in the
Gulf of Mexico. A Gore family trust owns stock in the Occidental
Petroleum Corp., a firm that benefits from the moratorium, said
Cheney, the former head of the oil field services firm Halliburton
Corp. Gore spokesman Douglas Hattaway rejected Cheney's criticism,
saying: `When the facts about the issues aren't convenient to the
Bush campaign, they resort to negative personal attacks.''
</P>

the Democrats' message of the day in Union, N.J., telling senior
citizens at a facility that serves 700 seniors a week that a

another 30 years'' and provide senior citizens ``more choices for
their health care so they are never left powerless and broke.''

AT LABOR CONVENTION, BLAIR ACCEPTS BLAME FOR PARTY'S DROP IN
POLLS 
</HEADLINE>
   By WARREN HOGE   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   BRIGHTON, England _ Prime Minister Tony Blair took personal
blame Tuesday for government actions that have sent the Labor
Party's resilient poll ratings plummeting this month, but he urged
the party to have confidence that it would defeat the Conservatives
and win a second term in the election expected in the next year.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm the prime minister that's supposed to be the great reader
of public opinion,'' he said at the party's annual convention in
this English Channel resort in a speech aimed at restoring his
battered reputation. ``After the events of two weeks ago, it's no
wonder the government has taken a knock. It happened on my watch,
and I take responsibility.''
</P>
<P>
   Blair was referring to a spontaneous fuel price protest by
farmers and truckers that attracted widespread public support and
provoked broad criticism of Blair _ who has long been credited with
having his finger on the public pulse _ for being highhanded and
out of touch. ``I am listening,'' he said pointedly, ``I hear, and
I will act.''
</P>
<P>
   He also conceded that two other high-profile moves had been
mistakes: a 75 pence ($1.10) increase last year in the weekly state
pension, which was scorned by recipients as miserly, and the
government's pet Millennium Dome project in London, which has drawn
far fewer people and cost far more money than expected.
</P>
<P>
   ``75p,'' he said, uttering the words that have become the
protest chant of pensioners, who now make up nearly 25 percent of
the British electorate. ``I tell you now,'' Blair said, ``we get
the message.''
</P>
<P>
   As for the dome, he commented, ``Hindsight is a wonderful thing,
and if I had my time again I would have listened to those who said
governments shouldn't try to run big visitor attractions.''
</P>
<P>
   The delegates to what was supposed to have been a rally to kick
off an election campaign have been bewildered at their party's
swift loss of public approval, and they enthusiastically greeted
Blair's unaccustomed expressions of contrition. ``Yes,'' he said to
an outburst of applause, ``there are things we have done that have
made people angry and we should be open enough, honest enough to
admit it.''
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Blair delivered his address vigorously, with sweat visibly
staining the front of his blue shirt and running down his forehead.
He spoke with the furrowed-brow intensity, distant visionary gaze
and trembling voice that have roused the faithful in the past while
bringing scorn from critics who mock his oratorical skills as more
suitable for the pulpit than the stump.
</P>
<P>
   The mood in the hall was upbeat, with delegates clapping their
hands before Blair's arrival to the rhythmic conference theme song,
Canned Heat's ``Let's Work Together.'' Many of them had been
dismayed at reports of cabinet infighting and bickering between
Blair and Chancellor of the Exchequer Gordon Brown, the
second-most-powerful man in the government.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Blair is expected to call the next election for May, and
Tuesday's speech was filled with campaign-style attacks on the
Tories, who have found themselves ahead of Labor in the polls this
month for the first time since 1992. The Conservative leader,
William Hague, has sought to capitalize on the recent Labor
blunders, but Blair dismissed the sudden gains as transitory.
``Opportunism always knocks for Mr. Hague,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Blair proclaimed a long list of social progress accomplishments
by Labor and contended that the Conservatives had opposed all of
them and would reverse them if voted back into power. He portrayed
himself as a ``unifier, a builder of consensus'' and Hague as
someone seeking short-term advantage by dividing.
</P>
<P>
   ``If people want me to go out and exploit the asylum issue for
reasons of race,'' he said in a biting reference to Conservative
calls for immigration restrictions, ``then vote for the other man,
because I won't do it.''
</P>
<P>
   Since Labor's rout of the Tories in 1997, Blair has devoted his
conference addresses to warning the party of the responsibilities
of managing success and the dangers of triumphalism and
complacency. Tuesday, he had the very different mission of
restoring Labor's confidence in its prospects for re-election _
considered a certainty until the recent fall in popularity _ and
repairing his own standing with the growing number of critics,
including many in his own party, who find him smug and
sanctimonious.
</P>
<P>
   He said it was not arrogance but the need to make tough choices
that held him back from responding directly to the fuel protesters'
demand for tax breaks and the pensioners' call for greater
participation in Britain's current prosperity. He said he would
never sacrifice public services for a voter-pleasing tax cut.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not an arrogant government that chooses priorities,'' he
said. ``It's an irresponsible government that fails to choose.''

 &HT;    Cuban star gives Bennett a pounding
 &HT;    By Tom Archdeacon
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   SYDNEY - He had just fought Felix Savon _ the Cuban icon who may
well be one of the greatest heavyweights of all time _ and now
Michael Bennett was being asked if along with the punches he had
felt the historical and social weight of the bout.
</P>
<P>
   That's heady stuff for a boxer, but Bennett did his best.
</P>
<P>
   ``History does play a part, you know,'' the American heavyweight
said after his 91-kilogram quarter-final. ``When (President)
Kennedy had the option of pushing the button, I consider that a lot
of pressure. He didn't push the button and we're all here today.
And because of it, I'm happy and blessed and I was able to do
battle with a great warrior today.''
</P>
<P>
   Bennett, the 29-year-old, smooth-domed captain of the U.S.
boxing team, and Savon, the two-time Olympic gold medalist and
six-time world champ, met Tuesday afternoon in what was billed as
one of the marquee match-ups of the Games.
</P>
<P>
   The bout wasn't two minutes old when Bennett realized he had his
own Cuban Missile Crisis. He was feeling the pressure as the
6-foot-6 Savon peppered him with jabs, stood him up with some solid
right hands and quickly built a big lead.
</P>
<P>
   Bennett needed to push the button and could not. Because of it,
he is not here today.
</P>
<P>
   The fight was stopped with three seconds left in the third round
after Savon went head 23-8 and the referee invoked the 15-point
rule.
</P>
<P>
   With Bennett eliminated, Savon is a step closer to becoming only
the third Olympic boxer in history to win three gold medals.
Hungarian middleweight Lazlo Papp did it a half century ago and
Cuban heavyweight Teofilo Stevenson ruled in 1972, 1976 and 1980.
</P>
<P>
   Like Stevenson, the 33-year-old Savon towers over Cuban boxing
and life in his sports-fueled nation. Long ago, Fidel Castro
learned the athletic fields and arenas were the one level
battlefield where Cubans could compete with the arch enemy ``Yankee
Imperialists.''
</P>
<P>
   Sports became a source of pride, propaganda and proficiency in
communist Cuba. It was best shown in baseball, though boxing has
run a close second. Since the 1972 Olympic Games in Munich _ and
that's with boycotting the 1984 and 1988 Olympics _ the island
nation has won 23 gold medals in boxing, including seven of 12 in
Barcelona and four in Atlanta in 1996.
</P>
<P>
   Savon was the star of the past two Olympiads, which is why
Castro held a special ceremony at the Karl Marx Theater in Havana
last month. Presenting the heavyweight with the national flag he
wanted him to carry into the Opening Ceremonies in Sydney, the
Cuban president called Savon ``a true revolutionary warrior.''
</P>
<P>
   At the World Championships in Houston in July 1999, it was Savon
who led a ringside protest after fellow Cuban Juan Hernandez lost
the title to a Russian on a terrible decision. Although ready to go
into the ring for his own title fight against Bennett, Savon
grabbed a Cuban flag and led his teammates in a march around the
ring
</P>
<P>
   Savon refused to fight unless the outcome was changed. It was
not, so Savon forfeited to Bennett. Five months later, the decision
was reversed. Hernandez got his title and the judges of the bout
were suspended for four years.
</P>
<P>
   Castro holds the heavyweight in special favor because he
continually refuses to be lured by foreign promoters trying to get
him to defect and turn pro. While he admitted he never has held as
much as $1,000 in his hands, he wanted nothing to do with Mexican
fight brokers who reportedly offered him $10 million to fight Mike
Tyson. In 1993, he was offered $5 million to defect in Puerto Rico.
In Atlanta, he was offered more and promoter Don King is said to
have a standing multimillion-dollar offer for him.
</P>
<P>
   ``Money is not everything,'' Savon has said in Cuban newspapers.
``He who abandons his fatherland has no love for anything in life
and there is no more beautiful family than the country where you
were born.''
</P>
<P>
   As has been well-documented, that mindset isn't always shared by
fellow Cubans. Whether it was due to political oppression,
barebones living conditions or the lure of money just 90 miles
away, many athletes have fled Cuba in the past decade. Several
defectors are now playing Major League Baseball and a few others
are dotting the rosters of various other Olympic teams here.
</P>
<P>
   Prior to the 1996 Olympics, two top boxers _ Olympic gold
medalist Joel Cassamayor and world champ Ramon Garbay _ fled the
Cuban team. At the 1999 Pan American Games in Winnipeg, 11 athletes
and a coach defected.
</P>
<P>
   That's why the 241 Cuban athletes headed to Sydney were given a
special warning before leaving the island. As was reported by
foreign journalists, Felix Perez Roque, the Cuban foreign minster,
told the team: ``Each one of you must get ready to face aggression,
harassment, blackmail attempts and bribery. If anyone is thinking
of betraying his people, stabbing the fatherland, now or later,
that person will be incapable of looking us in the eyes.''
</P>
<P>
   Bennett had a lot to gain with a victory. Not only would an
upset of Savon propel him toward the gold medal and launch a
much-hyped pro career, it would turn his life story into an instant
movie. Few athletes have a more colorful storyline than the
one-time small college football player from Chicago
</P>
<P>
   In 1991, he hooked up with a shotgun carrying buddy, who robbed
a Toys-R-Us store. The other guy was caught and turned in Bennett,
who was dubbed ``The Toy Store Bandit.'' He got a 26-year prison
sentence that appeals reduced to 15 years. Good behavior got him
released after seven years.
</P>
<P>
   During his incarceration, he learned how to box and some 19
months after his July 1998 release, he was named the captain of the
U.S. Olympic boxing team.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've been given a second chance and I'll make the most of
it,'' he promised when he got to Sydney.
</P>
<P>
   Before the bout, U.S. coach Tom Mustin said he felt Savon was
slipping, a claim that made Cuban coach Alcides Sagarrin laugh:
``Bennett is not a problem. The Americans did a lot of talking
before Atlanta and Barcelona, too.''

 &HT;    U.S. to face old nemesis Norway for women's soccer gold
 &HT;    By John Maher
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   SYDNEY _ The U.S. women's soccer team arrived here after playing
at satellite venues and will face Norway
</P>
<P>
   today in the gold-medal match. It would be hard to find more
evenly
</P>
<P>
   matched, or familiar, rivals at the Olympics in any sport.
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. squad, the reigning Olympic and World Cup champion,
began this
</P>
<P>
   tournament by beating Norway 2-0 before the Olympic torch was
even lit.
</P>
<P>
   ``After we played them I knew we would see them again,'' said
U.S. star
</P>
<P>
   Mia Hamm. ``They're a championship team, they
</P>
<P>
   have a lot of pride. They have a lot of personality players, and
it's no
</P>
<P>
   surprise to me that they've made it to the final. It's going to
be a
</P>
<P>
   difficult game, a hard-fought game.''
</P>
<P>
   The earlier Olympic win for the United States merely evened the
score
</P>
<P>
   for the year at 3-3-1 between the two teams. The all-time series
stands
</P>
<P>
   14-13-2 in favor of Norway, the only team in the world to enjoy
an edge
</P>
<P>
   on the much publicized U.S. women. With each team knowing each
other's
</P>
<P>
   style and players so well, you might expect a chess match on
grass, but
</P>
<P>
   Hamm doesn't.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can throw all the tactics out the window,'' Hamm said. ``I
think
</P>
<P>
   it's going to come down to 90 minutes of who wants it more.
We've seen
</P>
<P>
   everything there is to see out of each other ... This game is
not
</P>
<P>
   about preparation; it's not about tactics. It's about will.''
</P>
<P>
   The United States certainly has done fine in that department.
The squad was lumped in the so-called ``Group of Death''
</P>
<P>
   bracket with Norway, China and Nigeria. China was the odd soccer
super
</P>
<P>
   power out as the United States and Norway advanced to the
semifinals to
</P>
<P>
   face teams from the easier bracket, one that contained a
disappointing
</P>
<P>
   Australian team. Norway beat Germany 1-0, and the United States
had its
</P>
<P>
   typically contentious match with Brazil in the other semifinal.
</P>
<P>
   That game produced 41 fouls, four yellow cards for each team and
only
</P>
<P>
   one goal. Hamm's record 127th goal in international play was the
edge,
</P>
<P>
   but the Brazilians made her pay for it. Three of their four
yellow cards
</P>
<P>
   were picked up trying to contain _ or intimidate _ her.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a physical game and at different levels you're going to
have to
</P>
<P>
   expect that, and you're going to have to deal with it,'' Hamm
said.
</P>
<P>
   ``There were times it rattled us, but I think for the most part
we kind
</P>
<P>
   of endured and we got the result we wanted. It wasn't the
prettiest
</P>
<P>
   soccer, but we're in the final game. Hopefully we can just put
things
</P>
<P>
   together for one more game and get the result that we want.''
</P>
<P>
   She added, ``I feel good. I think we've been very fortunate with
the
</P>
<P>
   health of everyone through this tournament so far. We need
everyone
</P>
<P>
   healthy to compete against Norway.''
</P>
<P>
   Although goalkeeper Siri Mullinix had only two saves against
Brazil, in
</P>
<P>
   the 70th minute she was able to deflect an attempt by Roseli,
knocking
</P>
<P>
   it wide.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had one big save I had to make, and I made it'' Mullinix
said. ``I
</P>
<P>
   think that's what goalkeeping is about at the international
level.''
</P>
<P>
   Other than the absence of retired Michelle Akers, Mullinix
</P>
<P>
   may be the most noticeable on-field change from the squad that
won the
</P>
<P>
   World Cup. She's replaced Briana Scurry as the starter in goal
and
</P>
<P>
   teammates seem to have accepted that.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think the big thing that helped was that I was with the team
in '99
</P>
<P>
   training for the World Cup. At least they knew what I could do;
they
</P>
<P>
   knew who I was. They'd seen me play, at least in training,''
Mullinix
</P>
<P>
   said.
</P>
<P>
   She has already played several games against Norway and in one
had an
</P>
<P>
   outstanding performance. She said, ``They're a very direct style
team and
</P>
<P>
   they have two great forwards. They play a lot of long balls so
we're
</P>
<P>
   going to be aware of that, but we've worked with that all
year.''
</P>
<P>
   Norway's Marianne Pettersen has two goals this tournament but
U.S.
</P>
<P>
   coach April Heinrichs has heaped praise on Hege Riise, saying
``Riise is
</P>
<P>
   a winner and the kind of player I would have on my team any day.
She
</P>
<P>
   finds ways to win. She's thoughtful and crafty, and I love the
way she
</P>
<P>
   plays.''
</P>
<P>
   She's also impressed with Norway's keeper, Bente Nordby.
</P>
<P>
   The United States., which beat Brazil in Canberra, is only now
getting to Sydney and experiencing the Olympic atmosphere.
</P>
<P>
   Heinrichs said, ``There's a certain part of me that likes the
fact that
</P>
<P>
   at times it doesn't feel like the Olympics because we're on the
</P>
<P>
   outskirts. Then, it's just like any other tournament. Then it's
us
</P>
<P>
   against Norway. The outside factors don't come into play. As a
coach,
</P>
<P>
   those are some of the things you don't want to come into play.''
</P>
<P>
   Hamm added, ``It's been difficult for us to feel the Olympic
fever
</P>
<P>
   because we've been at a satellite venue. But we've been watching
and
</P>
<P>
   following all the athletes involved. It's an athlete's dream to
</P>
<P>
   participate in the Olympics.''
</P>
<P>
   Although the U.S. team is finally in Sydney, it's not in the
athletes'
</P>
<P>
   village.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have 20 players and we could only have one house,'' said
midfielder
</P>
<P>
   Julie Foudy. ``We like each other, but not that much.''
</P>
<P>
   Instead, the team is staying in a hotel. The veteran Foudy
played every
</P>
<P>
   minute in the team's march to gold in Atlanta. Of the 1996
</P>
<P>
   Olympics she said, ``It was wonderful for us because that was
like a
</P>
<P>
   coming out party. It kind of started things.''
</P>
<P>
   The team now feels a responsibility to keep that momentum going
and to
</P>
<P>
   promote the sport.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our team, the Norwegian team, the Chinese team, want to
display the
</P>
<P>
   game the best way we know how. I think you're seeing a higher
level of
</P>
<P>
   soccer every single year, and not just from a couple of teams
but from a
</P>
<P>
   wide variety of teams,'' Hamm said.
</P>
<P>
   But two teams, the only ones to ever win a Women's World Cup,
have
</P>
<P>
   proved the class of the field. It's Norway vs. the U.S. Again.

 &HT;    Start-ups shopping for attention at Networld
 &HT;    By Michael E. Kanell
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA - More than 550 companies this week set up shop at
Networld+Interop, hawking their wares _ hard and soft _ with loud
music, giveaways and multimedia presentations as part of the show
drawing an estimated 50,000 to the Georgia World Congress Center.
</P>
<P>
   At the far corner of the East Wing, down a ways from Cisco
Systems, Lucent Technologies and other multibillion-dollar
behomoths, is ``Start-Up City,'' a collection of low-rent booths.
</P>
<P>
   Despite their modest status, all want to be household names _ at
least in the homes of executives who buy technology.
</P>
<P>
   But what's in a name? Any company wants a name that will say
something about what it does, the service or product it hopes will
dominate some multibillion-dollar-a-year market. But you would also
love to have a name that grabs attention.
</P>
<P>
   YottaYotta Inc. thinks it has both.
</P>
<P>
   With about 40 employees, Kirkland, Wash.- based YottaYotta is
making storage systems for networks and companies that must handle
and stockpile huge amounts of data. YottaYotta has designed a
system meant to work faster as the amount of data increases.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's our hardware, our software and our secret sauce,'' said
marketing chief Cindy Salazar.
</P>
<P>
   The advantage at Massachusetts-based OpenReach, said Vice
President David Kelly, is software that lets smaller companies have
the advantages of privacy when communicating among various
locations. Of course, OpenReach is not averse to a little
gratuitous attention either. Company employees at Networld+Interop
were wearing black T-shirts matched with mock camouflage pants of
orange, black and yellow.
</P>
<P>
   A range of technologies is on display in the East Wing.
</P>
<P>
   Radiata, for example, is a 45-worker San Jose, Calif., company
that is designing chips to be used in wireless networking devices.
Cereva is a Massachusetts company preparing a launch of optical
networking products.
</P>
<P>
   Giants like Cisco are often just looking to make sales, but what
newer entrants need more is exposure, said Jerry Caron, publisher
of Tele.com, a publication that covers the industry. ``Being seen
as participants, to say they are not still in the garage _ that is
very important. The see-and-being-seen is a soft benefit, but it's
tangible.''
</P>
<P>
   The cooling of Internet ardor has not dampened investor desire
for companies whose equipment and software makes Net commerce
easier or more efficient, he said. Cereva, for example, has raised
$66 million in two years. OpenReach has been given $21 million in
10 months since birth. And YottaYotta has drawn $24 million in less
than a year.
</P>
<P>
   That fervent interest in Net commerce is shared by $42
billion-a-year Hewlett-Packard, said chief executive Carly Fiorina,
who kicked off the conference Tuesday as keynote speaker. Ticking
off HP products, she told several thousand attendees that HP has
set out to adapt to the technology changes. ``We said that any
process, any asset, any application that could be digitized would
be and delivered over the Web.''
</P>
<P>
   Fiorina, perhaps the highest-profile and most celebrated female
high-tech executive this year, said the moment is critical for all
the companies at Networld+Interop. ``I believe we are entering a
fundamentally different era in the Internet economy. I believe we
are entering the Renaissance of the Internet.''

 &HT;    Secret of browning put mid-century doughboys in the black
 &HT;    By Noah Bierman
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. - The story of a classic American comfort
food begins with a false fire alarm, makes its way through a
Dumpster and is retold _ 51 years after it started _ in a suburban
Lantana kitchen by a retiree who helped create a minor baking
phenomenon.
</P>
<P>
   ``We should almost know they're ready by the smell,'' said Jules
Jacobsen, agreeing to brown 'n serve a batch of Brown 'N Serve
dinner rolls. ``They should begin to smell like fresh bread baking.
Then you got it.''
</P>
<P>
   Seven to 10 minutes later, Jacobsen pulls a pan from the oven,
raises one of the crisp rolls to his nostrils and breaks it open.
It looks and smells right, but it's too brittle. The package,
supplied by his guests, has no expiration date printed on it.
</P>
<P>
   ``Take 'em back. Get your money back,'' he says, disappointed.
</P>
<P>
   It's a rare moment of bread-related frustration for Jacobsen,
who used the soft white rolls to secure a small place in American
culinary history.
</P>
<P>
   When the story begins, in 1940s America, there was no microwave
popcorn, no Taco Bell Chalupas. Only 25 percent of married women
worked outside the home, compared with 62 percent now.
</P>
<P>
   Jacobsen, an Air Force gunnery instructor, made friends with a
cook named Joe Gregor. After they were discharged, both men settled
in Avon Park, a small town northwest of Lake Okeechobee where they
had been stationed during service.
</P>
<P>
   Gregor, a former milkman, opened a bakery, but he was attracting
only five or six customers a day. His rolls cooled too quickly,
customers told him. People wanted them hot for dinner.
</P>
<P>
   Night after night, Jacobsen and Gregor would discuss ways to
cook the rolls partially, using chemicals or shorter cooking times.
Nothing worked. The gluten _ needed to keep the dough from folding
_ didn't have time to set if the rolls weren't cooked long enough.
</P>
<P>
   Then Gregor, a volunteer firefighter, heard an alarm. He threw
his apron aside and yanked some half-baked rolls from the oven. It
was a brush fire, so the other firefighters said he could forget
about it and return to the bakery.
</P>
<P>
   On his work table, he found what he and Jacobson had been
searching for: partially cooked rolls that browned easily with a
few more minutes in the oven.
</P>
<P>
   But the two men couldn't figure out why the rolls held their
form _ until they bought an oven thermometer.
</P>
<P>
   The oven was leaking more than 100 degrees of heat, they
discovered, cooking the rolls only at 275 degrees instead of the
typical 450.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is the whole secret,'' Jacobsen said.
</P>
<P>
   At this temperature, the gluten sets, but the sugar doesn't get
hot enough to caramelize and turn brown.
</P>
<P>
   ``Too simple. It was an accident,'' Jacobsen says, still smiling
at the memory. ``It wasn't brilliance.''
</P>
<P>
   Jacobsen, a promoter and advertiser, became Gregor's partner. He
packaged and gave out samples of ``Pop-N-Oven'' rolls to grocery
store clerks and their bosses, newspaper reporters, customers and
the Publix supermarket chain.
</P>
<P>
   In 1949, 18 months after they started, the men were selling all
the rolls they could fit in the rumble seats of their cars, baking
two days a week and delivering on the other five. The regional
sales director for General Mills, who lived in nearby Tampa, sent a
batch to headquarters in Minneapolis.
</P>
<P>
   ``They looked at these pale, anemic-looking rolls in their
kitchen and threw them out,'' Jacobsen said.
</P>
<P>
   The salesman called quality control and demanded the product
testers dig the rolls out of the Dumpster, brown them and eat them.
</P>
<P>
   By the time negotiations with General Mills ended, Jacobsen and
Gregor sold rights to the rolls for $60,000. Jacobsen recalls a
period of intense secrecy. General Mills called the rolls ``Project
49'' and made the few employees with knowledge sign secrecy
pledges, according to a 1949 issue of the Minneapolis Sunday
Tribune.
</P>
<P>
   Jacobsen said the phone company told him his phone was being
tapped. A rival bread company? Jacobsen thinks so, but acknowledges
he can't prove it.
</P>
<P>
   Company executives spirited the men to Atlanta for three days of
intense questioning. They couldn't sit together on the plane or
leave their hotel for meals. When it was over, they went to a
department store where executives bought Gregor's wife a pearl
necklace and Jacobsen's a silver dinner set.
</P>
<P>
   General Mills used the men's story to promote the new product in
ads and national newspaper stories. The company took professional
pictures of their happy, suburban families eating Brown 'N Serve
rolls.
</P>
<P>
   But the images faded when Gregor filed suit, claiming the rolls
were his idea and Jacobsen didn't deserve half the proceeds. The
friendship ended.
</P>
<P>
   Jacobsen said company executives testified on his behalf, and,
after an 18-month trial, a judge awarded Gregor $31,000 and
Jacobsen $29,000. Gregor has since died, and the court records
could not be obtained.
</P>
<P>
   General Mills did not keep its Brown 'N Serve monopoly. Instead,
the company sent thermometers and instruction books on how to make
the rolls to commercial bakers around the country, hoping to boost
flour sales. Company archivist Katie Dishman said General Mills
probably stopped selling its own Brown 'N Serve rolls in the 1960s
or 1970s, but she could not pinpoint an exact date. Supermarkets
and several national companies continue to package their own brands
of Brown 'N Serve rolls. The rolls, in some small way, helped
change America. They were among the first products that allowed
regular people to serve restaurant-quality food at home without
labor-intensive baking, said David Pursglove, a Washington, D.C.,
analyst who has predicted food trends since 1963.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's right in there along with the microwave oven,'' Pursglove
said.
</P>
<P>
   Jacobsen, 81, went on to make a lot more money on another trend
_ suburban newspaper publishing. He sold the weekly North Jersey
Suburbanite in 1986 for millions. (He won't say how many.)
</P>
<P>
   He moved to Manalapan 27 years ago, then the Lantana area last
year. He admits he doesn't eat Brown 'N Serve rolls on a regular
basis, but every now and again he'll pick up a package.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's All-American. It really is. A couple of GI's, pretty
stupid, dumb, falling into something like that.''
</P>
<P>
   Staff researchers Sammy Alzofon and Geni Guseila contributed to
this story.

 &HT;    BUY ME, BUY ME, BUY ME!
 &HT;    By Staci Sturrock
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. - Three seconds.
</P>
<P>
   She figures that's how long she's got to grab you by the collar
and make you reach for your wallet. She uses the big guns: direct
eye contact, a bewitching smile and whispered promises of money,
power and sex. If she's successful, you leave the store with her
under your arm _ a glossy women's magazine.
</P>
<P>
   The first magazine that shoppers pick up is more than likely the
one they end up buying, says Mandi Norwood, Mademoiselle's new
editor in chief. ``Your covers have to be making so much more noise
than anyone else's.''
</P>
<P>
   And not just more visual racket than fellow women's titles such
as Glamour, Marie Claire, Jane or Cosmopolitan. ``Everything with a
front and back cover is a competitor. We live in such a
time-deprived world.''
</P>
<P>
   Norwood joined Mademoiselle earlier this year after editing
three British magazines. She felt that Mademoiselle had devolved
into something generic. There was nothing unique, irresistible or
compelling about it, she said.
</P>
<P>
   And so she and her colleagues gave the 65-year-old magazine _
the magazine credited with creating the makeover _ a makeover. It
joins Harper's Bazaar, National Geographic, Mother Jones and George
on the list of titles that have recently gone under the X-Acto
knife. Here are some of the tweaks the Mademoiselle team made to
its cover:
</P>
<P>
   The Magazine for Your Me Years _The target readership of
Mademoiselle ranges from 18 to 35, with a focus on 20- to
30-year-olds who are living in their ``Me Years.'' Those are the
years after college but before family, ``when you have time and
money to spend only on yourself,'' says the 35-year-old Norwood,
who is married and has two children. ``This time is absolutely
unique, and I felt like there wasn't a magazine out there
addressing it.''
</P>
<P>
   99% guilt free _ ``I like it because it gives the cover a
three-dimensional feel.'' Plus, it's a joke on women's obsession
with fat-free foods.
</P>
<P>
   The choice of model _ Mademoiselle has moved away from using
pure entertainers on its covers (its three previous cover subjects
were Minnie Driver, Neve Campbell and members of pop group TLC) to
models who act or host TV shows, ``multidimensional girls,''
Norwood says. James King has three starring roles in three new
movies.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a lot to be said for a picture of a girl who kind of
embodies the spirit of your magazine rather than a celebrity who
looks miserable,'' Norwood says. ``She has an ease about her, a
confidence. She looks sexy, she looks positive.
</P>
<P>
   When she's selecting a cover shot, Norwood looks for the
``tingle factor,'' she says. ``It's when you look at a picture and
it makes the sides of your face tingle.''
</P>
<P>
   Change of typeface _
</P>
<P>
   The new typeface ``looks cleaner, warmer, happier, friendlier,''
Norwood says. Its more rounded lines are like ``a happy smiling
face.... The appeal of magazines works on so many different
levels.''
</P>
<P>
   Use of numbers _ ``It certainly beats putting, `Inside, a lot of
stuff.' It's a way of being really specific, and it gives a feeling
of value.''
</P>
<P>
   Naughty phrases _ The new Mademoiselle comes with a new attitude
of cheekiness, Norwood says. Cover lines from the last three
issues: ``14 rules we want you to break _ today!'' ``Be very bad
and get away with it every time'' and ``You got a promotion!
Coincidence or bitchcraft?''
</P>
<P>
   ``I love that there's a sense of mischief. Each one of us has
our own sense of playfulness and mischief. It just makes life more
fun. This gives people permission to live by their own rules.
</P>
<P>
   ``It assumes a certain amount of self-confidence to start with.
Some other magazines perpetuate the myth of women analyzing and
agonizing. Women out there know what they want. They're getting up
in the morning and saying, 'Hello, world!'''
</P>
<P>
   The Sex Best Thing _ ``Young women are having sex, so it would
be ridiculous for us to do a magazine that didn't address sex
because it would be ignoring an important part of a woman's life,''
says Norwood, adding that magazines are the biggest and best
communicators of information on sex. She feels it's Mademoiselle's
duty to address those issues, with responsibility. ``Can you ever
know too much about sex? Probably not.'' However, Mademoiselle is
``not about the nitty-gritty of sex.... We like to be a little more
creative with our sex coverage.''
</P>
<P>
   Million-dollar hair for under $30 _ Using a dollar amount is
another way to convey value, Norwood says. ``During the Me Years,
you want more bang for your buck. You want every single dollar to
go a million miles.''
</P>
<P>
   The use of ``you'' and ``me'' _ Using the words ``you'' and
``me'' makes the cover as personal as possible. ``Magazines are
very intimate purchases, almost like underwear,'' Norwood says.
``You don't want to feel like everyone's tried it on before you.''
</P>
<P>
   Peep Show _ ``We like men. Men are good,'' Norwood says. ``Women
are fascinated at this time in their lives with what men are
thinking. 'What is he doing when he's not with me?'''
</P>
<P>
   Wed Dreams _ Different approaches to tired topics, a focus on
lively writing. ``For a long time, women's magazines have been
accused of not having a sense of humor. If I can make people smile
or giggle, that's going to keep them coming back for more,''
Norwood says. ``Although perish the thought that we would be a
female Maxim.''

   YUGO-ELECTIONS (Belgrade, Yugoslavia) _ The
government-controlled Federal Election Commission announced on
Tuesday night that President Slobodan Milosevic had won enough
votes to force a second-round runoff for the presidency against
challenger Vojislav Kostunica, challenging Kostunica's claim of an
outright victory in the first round of voting on Sunday. Opposition
leaders immediately called the commission figures fraudulent and
said they would insist that Kostunica had won without the need for
a runoff, which would take place on Oct. 8. By Steven Erlanger.

SUPPORTING THE EURO 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   LAST WEEK'S coordinated effort by central banks to shore up the
exchange value of Europe's new currency, the euro, confirms the
importance attached to stabilizing rates among the major
currencies. The effort, combining American and Japanese purchases
of the euro along with those of the European Central Bank, was at
least temporarily effective. Still, systemic changes will have to
be made in the European economy to place the euro on a sounder
base.
</P>
<P>
   In less than two years of existence, the euro has fallen more
than 25 percent, from $1.17 when it was launched at the beginning
of 1999 to 85 cents just prior to the intervention. The decline was
unexpected because Europe's economy is performing reasonably well.
Unemployment rates, while high in Germany and other countries in
comparison with America, are coming down. Inflation is low.
Business is generally brisk.
</P>
<P>
   Although Europeans have embraced new technology, elements in the
economy remain fairly rigid. Labor mobility _ willingness (or
necessity) to move from job to job _ has not matched American
performance and is hampered by cultural and language barriers that
make such moves more difficult.
</P>
<P>
   This helps explain the export of European capital to purchase
assets elsewhere that look more attractive than others at home. The
shift of assets deprives Europeans of maximum efficiencies and
simultaneously puts further pressure on the value of the euro. Much
of the outflow has come to America _ more than $80 billion in 1999,
immediately following arrival of the euro, and only slightly less
is forecast for all of this year.
</P>
<P>
   In the near term, Americans benefit from the flow of capital. It
means more investment in job-producing industries and businesses
and, above all, in further technological gains. In the long term,
however, Americans have to worry about a weak euro because it
inhibits Europeans' ability to buy American goods and services and
makes European goods and services more competitive in other
markets. Hence the American willingness to try to bolster the
exchange rate of the euro.
</P>
<P>
   Europe is a long way from facing a crisis, though political
reaction to rising petroleum prices, exacerbated by the decline in
the euro, was quite strident. Making basic adjustments is a slow
process under the best of circumstances. But a strong European
economy is good for everyone, and a strong euro is both an
indicator and a contributor to it, just as a strong dollar has
helped both expand the American economy and shield it from
inflation during its long expansion. The central banks'
intervention may be most important for reminding everyone of those
fundamental facts.

ENDING POLIO 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   THE ERADICATION of polio is so close that it would be a tragedy
for humankind if this crippling disease were allowed to linger in
isolated pockets of the world. The United Nations agencies and
private organizations involved in the campaign need to redouble
their efforts to make sure the new 2005 deadline is met.
</P>
<P>
   The United Nations had announced that the disease would be gone
by the end of this year, but that projection was premature. A
meeting will be held at UN headquarters Wednesday to plan the
climactic phase of the campaign.
</P>
<P>
   ``Other things intervened _ conflicts, HIV/AIDS, debilitated
health systems,'' said Carol Bellamy, executive director of UNICEF,
explaining the missed deadline. If the UN and other international
organizations can eliminate smallpox, as they did in 1977, then
they can find the resources and the will to destroy the polio
virus.
</P>
<P>
   War is the prime reason for the failure to vaccinate children in
Angola and the Congo. Fighting is episodic, however, and
vaccination campaigns can go forward despite the poor highway and
communication systems. With enough money, personnel, and diplomatic
acumen to encourage combatants to declare a truce for polio
vaccination, the campaign ought to succeed.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're going to win despite all the warring factions in the
world,'' said Bill Sargent of Rotary International, which has made
polio eradication a priority since 1988. ``Even they claim to be
concerned about children.'' A majority of the victims are under age
5.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike the intractable AIDS epidemic, polio is an easily
solvable problem. The disease has been eradicated in the Western
Hemisphere, and only 1,148 cases were reported so far this year in
Asia and Africa. UNICEF and the World Health Organization are
committed to the campaign, as well as the US Centers for Disease
Control, the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation, and Rotary
International. Together these organizations have the clout and the
expertise to wipe out polio.
</P>
<P>
   In advance of the UN meeting, the World Health Organization has
laid out an agenda for success. It calls for a series of National
Immunization Days, investigation of any paralysis cases for links
to polio, and mop-up immunization campaigns. The price of this
initiative exceeds $1 billion, and $450 million has yet to be
committed.
</P>
<P>
   Participants at the UN meeting will make a fund-raising appeal
to foundations and other private donors Wednesday. The US
government, which has been generous in its support of the campaign
in the past, ought to make up any shortfall so that the 2005
deadline can be met. It's time to give polio a final push to
oblivion.

&HT;     GIANTS ARE AIMING FOR THE WORLD SERIES 
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 &HT;     By JOHN SHEA  
 &HT;     c.2000 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ The Giants want it all now. The World Series or
bust. If it's not a Fall Classic, in their minds, it'll be a
classic fall.
</P>
<P>
   After clinching the National League West last week, the Giants
made it known they wouldn't settle for anything less than a final
showdown with the New York Yankees, or any other team the American
League submits.
</P>
<P>
   But first there's this tiny matter of getting there, of winning
the first two rounds of the playoffs, of advancing past the mighty
Atlanta Braves, who appeared in five of the last eight World
Series.
</P>
<P>
   The Giants, who play at Dodger Stadium the next three nights,
are relatively new to October ball, especially late-October ball.
They made the 1997 playoffs but got bounced immediately. They were
in the 1989 World Series, but the only player from that team still
with the Giants is now their first-base coach, Robby Thompson.
</P>
<P>
   When it comes to World Series experience, the Giants rank last
among the National League's four playoff teams _ pitchers Livan
Hernandez and Robb Nen played for the 1997 Florida Marlins, and
reliever Alan Embree was with the 1995 Cleveland Indians.
</P>
<P>
   The New York Mets list six players who appeared in a World
Series. The St. Louis Cardinals seven. The Braves have the most of
course, with 16.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's important,'' manager Dusty Baker said. ``That's why the
Braves and Yankees have an advantage over everybody.''
</P>
<P>
   At least the Giants can say they have 13 players who've
participated in the playoffs (eight with their '97 team), but only
three have reached the World Series. In fact, the team has more
World Series rings on the coaching staff _ Baker, Thompson, Gene
Clines and Dave Righetti _ than the active roster.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a dream you don't want to wake up from,'' said Embree,
whose Indians fell to Atlanta in six games. ``From the first time I
began warming up, the adrenaline rush didn't end. I could tell you
everything about each of my (four) appearances. What happened, who
I faced, what the count was, who went in after me.
</P>
<P>
   ``The only bad thing about a World Series is it goes by so fast,
you hardly realize you're in it. When it's over, you ask, 'What do
you mean it's over?'''
</P>
<P>
   Baker has great World Series memories of his three appearances
with the Dodgers, all against the Yankees, but he has no plans to
throw the Baseball Encyclopedia at his players. He'd prefer they
savor it themselves. And if anyone should say anything, it should
be the three pitchers who've been there.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it's easier for them to relay the feelings than for
me. They've been there more recently,'' Baker said. ``It helps if
you've had pitchers in the World Series because pitchers have the
most control of a game, and we have three. That's huge. i don't
want to psyche them out. I'd prefer to let them experience it. It's
like going to Vietnam. If you've never been there, no one can tell
you about it. You'd have to experience it for yourself. Until you
get to a World Series and feel the energy and vibrations, you have
no idea.''

&HT;     POLITICIANS WANT TO MEDDLE WITH PROMISING MEDICAL RESEARCH 
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     Commentary  
 &HT;     (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 &HT;     By MARIANNE MEANS  
 &HT;     c.2000 Hearst Newspapers  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The political struggle over abortion intrudes once
again on an issue crucial to the health of millions of Americans,
pitting reverence for undeveloped, unborn human tissue against
potential advances in medical treatment for living men, women and
children.
</P>
<P>
   In this case it is not the mental and physical well-being of a
pregnant woman that is endangered but that of victims suffering
from Parkinson's and Alzheimer's diseases, diabetes and other
serious illnesses.
</P>
<P>
   Where should compassion lie? With inanimate, nonbreathing
embryonic stem cells or disabled and sick friends and family
members needing medical help?
</P>
<P>
   No contest, I say. Save the living.
</P>
<P>
   Scientific evidence indicates that biomedical research on human
embryonic stem cells could lead to remedies for all sorts of
life-threatening human afflictions not now curable. Scientists do
not consider the cells themselves to be embryos because they can be
extracted and isolated and have not yet grown into the specialized
matter that makes up muscles, nerves, blood and organs. The
potential for unprecedented medical miracles by replacing diseased
tissue with stem cells is astonishing.
</P>
<P>
   But anti-abortion activists don't care about reality. They
equate the cells with an intact, full-term fetus and demand the
same legal rights for the cells as those granted a living person.
</P>
<P>
   ``Stem cell research is immoral,'' thunders Sen. Sam Brownback,
R-Kan., a leading anti-abortion crusader who believes an embryo is
``a person fully deserving of dignity.''
</P>
<P>
   Sens. Arlen Specter, R-Pa., and Tom Harkin, D-Idaho, define
dignity and morality differently. They say that stem cell research
holds so much potential that ``it is morally wrong'' to keep
scientists from pursing it. Their priority is in giving millions in
pain the chance for a life-saving cure.
</P>
<P>
   Caught in the emotional clamor are federal regulations, issued
in August, that require all stem cell research to be conducted
under strict ethical guidelines.
</P>
<P>
   Under the rules, the microscopic clumps of cells must come from
embryos created in clinics for fertility treatment, and are due to
be discarded because they are no longer needed. Extra embryos are
often created for multiple in-vitro pregnancy attempts.
</P>
<P>
   Unless implanted in a woman, the tissue cannot grow into a
fetus. Using these spare embryos does not amount to killing babies.
</P>
<P>
   This has become a presidential campaign issue because the Senate
is considering a bill to allow government-sponsored scientists the
freedom to engage in embryonic stem cell research, so long as they
follow the new guidelines. For five years Congress has banned the
use of taxpayer funds for research that directly involves embryos.
The basic progress in this area has been made by privately
sponsored scientists.
</P>
<P>
   Specter and Harkin have held seven hearings on the issue and
Senate Majority Leader Trent Lott has promised a vote on the bill
before Congress adjourns this fall.
</P>
<P>
   As with other abortion-related issues, Vice President Al Gore
and Gov. George W. Bush are on opposite sides.
</P>
<P>
   Gore firmly puts the disabled and ill first, favoring the
extension and funding of embryonic stem cell research. He does not
believe that life begins at conception but rather when the fetus
``quickens'' and has the potential of living outside the mother.
Consequently he supports the concept that abortion should be an
issue between a woman and her doctor.
</P>
<P>
   Bush, by contrast, believes in life at conception and is firmly
anti-abortion, except if necessary to save the life of the mother.
This places him in the camp that opposes embryonic stem cell
research.
</P>
<P>
   But Bush says he supports the concept of federal help to expand
medical studies. He promised to ``fund and lead a medical moon shot
to reach far beyond what seems possible today and discover new
cures for age-old afflictions.'' He said if elected president he
would spend $91 billion to promote federal research on a variety of
diseases, including Alzheimer's.
</P>
<P>
   His promise is a fraud, however, if he refuses to let scientists
pursue the most promising avenue to a ``medical moon shot'' _
embryonic stem cell research.
</P>
<P>
   Do we live in a modern world of technological breakthroughs or a
medieval fortress trapped in religious dogma and intellectual
ignorance? To stop medical research on the grounds of ethical
considerations not shared by everyone would be a tragedy for those
with diseases, but also for all the rest of us.

 &HT;    Female executives are common on the `soft side' of business
 &HT;    By Caroline Hubbard
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ As Trisha Harris arranged name tags before a
PTEKVentures networking party, she noticed only a few women's names
in the pile.
</P>
<P>
   Harris, vice president of communications at PTEK Holdings, was
surprised, despite being the only woman corporate vice president at
PTEK. She knows that PTEK's venture arm has yet to invest in a
woman entrepreneur. She knows that almost every woman she meets in
the Atlanta technology scene is in marketing, public relations or
human resources _ the ``soft'' side of the technology industry.
</P>
<P>
   Still, she was surprised.
</P>
<P>
   In the ``new economy'' _ where executives are younger, dress
hipper and make decisions at Internet speed _ it is easy to forget
that one thing is pretty much the same: women's roles.
</P>
<P>
   Women for the most part aren't running Atlanta's new technology
companies or investing in them.
</P>
<P>
   The reasons for this phenomenon are hard to nail down. Some cite
discrimination, albeit subtle. Others argue that most women just
aren't interested in technology.
</P>
<P>
   The PTEK configuration is mirrored at technology companies all
over town. At Internet consulting firm iXL Enterprises, women head
public relations and human resources. But the chief executive,
chief operating officer and chief technology officer are all men.
</P>
<P>
   When Jeff Levy launched trendy incubator eHatchery last year, he
did it with men as chief operating officer, chief technology
officer and chief financial officer. Women were in charge of
facilities management, public relations and human resources.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the executives who are successfully launching their own
ventures also are men. Nationally, women headed only 4 percent of
IT companies that raised venture capital in 1999, according to
research group VentureOne. Just 40 percent of the IT companies that
raised capital in 1999 had at even one woman on their managment
teams.
</P>
<P>
   Though VentureOne doesn't break its gender data down by region,
experts suspect that Atlanta has even fewer female entrepreneurs
and start-up executives than other high-tech hotbeds.
</P>
<P>
   In Silicon Valley, established technology companies churn out
female executives qualified to start their own companies, said Amy
Millman, executive director of the National Women's Business
Council. ``They have just been doing it longer,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   More women are entrepreneurs in places like San Francisco and
Boston because female venture capitalists hand out money in those
cities.
</P>
<P>
   Denise Brosseau, president and co-founder of the Foundation of
Women Entrepreneurs in San Francisco, said that men are more likely
to fund men. She points to a study from National Foundation of
Women Business Owners that says 67 percent of female investors have
invested in women-led companies, versus only 40 percent of men
investors.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you think about how the process is done, venture
capitalists fund people they know, people in their network, people
they went to school with, people they play basketball with,'' she
said. ``The good news is that once investors fund a woman-led
company, they are twice as likely to fund another.'' VentureOne
recently put out a list of the 33 most active female venture
capitalists in the country. No one from Atlanta made the list.
</P>
<P>
   Only a few female venture capitalists are in Atlanta, and none
are at the city's big firms.
</P>
<P>
   Bonnie Herron is at Intelligent Systems, which typically invests
small chunks of money in early-stage companies.
</P>
<P>
   She's been investing in technology companies on behalf of
Intelligent Systems since 1990 and would like to mentor young
women. But, Herron said, she would not invest in a company based on
the gender of its founders.
</P>
<P>
   As a venture capitalist, Herron has never felt men were
discriminating against her, she said. ``Sometimes, (being a women)
is an advantage because you stand out, as long as you are
credible.''
</P>
<P>
   Many of Atlanta's top venture capitalists _ men like Alan Taetle
at Noro-Moseley Partners and Stephen Fleming at Alliance Technology
Ventures _ say they don't discriminate against women and, in fact,
wish there were more female entrepreneurs.
</P>
<P>
   Cheryl King, who is bucking the gender trend as chief financial
officer at software company Alogent, said she never feels openly
discriminated against. She gets plenty of calls from recruiters
trying to lure her to other companies. Still, she thinks being a
woman in a man's world is difficult.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is hard to be one of only a handful,'' she said. ``When you
go to networking events, it is harder to go start conversations
when you are the only woman.''
</P>
<P>
   Women in Atlanta may voluntarily steer clear of technology
because it is such a male-dominated world, she said. ``It still
feels like an old-boys' network in some respects. It is always who
you know in this town.''
</P>
<P>
   Catherine Tabor, who is trying to raise money for her
Atlanta-based online concierge service, Sparkfly, said men consider
a woman chief executive to be ``politically correct.''
</P>
<P>
   But ``from a credibility standpoint, there have been
challenges,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Some experts argue women don't get into technology because they
aren't encouraged in math and science in school. Many studies have
shown that girls tend to lose interest in such subjects during
middle school. At the Georgia Institute of Technology, the number
of female students still lags the number of males.
</P>
<P>
   Levy at eHatchery said he would love to hire more women but has
found few interested in becoming programmers or holding other tech
jobs. ``(The discrepancy) probably relates to the number of women
in graduate and undergraduate technology-based degree programs,''
he said.
</P>
<P>
   Some women say they have stuck with ``soft'' jobs because they
don't want the hours that top executives typically work.
</P>
<P>
   Whatever the reasons, women are a lot less likely to hold the
jobs with big salaries and large equity stakes.
</P>
<P>
   At a typical technology company in the IPO stage, the chief
executive officer makes $200,000 to $225,000 a year, and the chief
technology officer earns $140,000 to $165,000, according to Jim
Reda, a compensation consultant at Arthur Andersen in Atlanta.
Compare that to the corporate vice president of marketing, who
typically earns $105,000 to $130,000 and a vice president of human
resources who probably makes $70,000 to $90,000.
</P>
<P>
   The new economy soon may be more gender-balanced, experts agree.
Millman points back to the VentureOne statistics. In 1999, 40
percent of companies that got venture capital funding had at least
one woman on the management team. In 1997, that figure was 24
percent.

<P>
   ``That is a huge changeover,'' she said. ``In the next five
years, we are going to see a lot more women in (top) positions.''
</P>
<P>
   Herron said she sees more quality business plans from female
entrepreneurs in Atlanta these days. Some of these women likely
will be successful and will become role models and possibly
investors, she said.
</P>
<P>
   Some technology leaders say they will work hard to encourage
more women to become entrepreneurs and high-tech executives. They
say women make good managers and that diverse management teams are
better at solving problems.
</P>
<P>
   Others claim to be gender-blind.
</P>
<P>
   Levy describes recruiting as a balancing act.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it is critical to have a diverse management team in
every respect,'' he said.

 &HT;    Worldspan flying high as travel sites flourish
 &HT;    By Nancy Fonti
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ As online travel agencies race to turn themselves into
flashy brands and household names, one Atlanta company is working
quietly behind the scenes and cashing in as more travelers turn
into Netheads.
</P>
<P>
   If you've ever shopped for or bought an airline ticket through
the Web, chances are good you've visited a site powered by the
Worldspan booking engine, a massive hub of computers that processes
airline, hotel and rental-car reservations.
</P>
<P>
   Housed in a secret location in Atlanta, the Worldspan system now
handles 30 million airline reservations a year booked through
online agents, according to Worldspan, which also has headquarters
here. That's over half of all airline reservations made through
online agents.
</P>
<P>
   It's difficult to verify who leads in online agency bookings;
all data are supplied by the companies. Nonetheless, Worldspan's
client roster vouches for its claim. It books reservations for the
two most-visited travel sites: online agency Expedia.com and
name-your-own-price mammoth priceline.com.
</P>
<P>
   Newcomer Orbitz, the travel agency owned by five top U.S.
airlines, will book via Worldspan after its launch next year. In
addition to the online agents, Worldspan powers the sites of its
three airline owners _ TWA, Northwest Airlines and Atlanta-based
Delta Air Lines.
</P>
<P>
   The Internet arrived as Worldspan needed a growth avenue apart
from its core business of supplying reservations systems and
services to traditional travel agents.
</P>
<P>
   The company was created in 1990 when Delta, Northwest and TWA
combined their scheduling and booking distribution systems. By that
time Sabre Inc. _ the largest computer reservations system company
based on revenue _ already had a head start among traditional
travel agents.
</P>
<P>
   Because Worldspan was slower to the starting gate, it was left
with just a sliver of the global travel agent market. The company
served 17,900 travel agencies locations worldwide, compared with
40,669 for Sabre as of June 1999, according to Global Distribution
Systems: Outlook for the 21st Century. In 1998, the Worldspan
system booked just 12 percent of all reservations made by travel
agents.
</P>
<P>
   ``We saw the Internet as a clean slate,'' said Paul J. Blackney,
Worldspan president and chief executive. ``At one point, travel
agents booked between 80 and 85 percent of travel ... but business
is shifting to other channels that tend to be electronic. We wanted
to to be in the emerging part of the market.''
</P>
<P>
   Eyeing the top spot, the company pounced on this new breed of
customers. The first big client was Expedia; later priceline
decided to use the Worldspan system to sift through the fares of
its airline partners.
</P>
<P>
   Here's how the Worldspan engine works online: a cybershopper
logs on to an online agent, types in her destination and travel
dates and then hits enter. The site connects with Worldspan, which
searches through all participating airline itineraries for fares.
Within 10 seconds, the information is listed for the traveler, who
then selects the itinerary. Once a flight is chosen, Worldspan
books the ticket with the airline and creates an itinerary.
</P>
<P>
   As Worldspan was busy signing up online customers for its
reservation systems, competitors were creating their own travel Web
sites. Sabre, for instance, built a powerhouse in Travelocity.com.
Though Worldspan toyed with the idea of starting its own booking
site, it ultimately decided to stay in the back-engine business
because it wouldn't have to compete with the Web sites it powered.
</P>
<P>
   ``They elected not to build their own brand, and that gave them
a real edge,'' said Chicke Fitzgerald, a consultant to Worldspan
and other computer reservations companies and author of Global
Distribution Systems. ``You don't have to spend to promote the
brand. It's a really prudent business model.''
</P>
<P>
   Worldspan employs 3,450 workers, 1,950 in Atlanta. The company's
corporate offices are in the Galleria, but it never discloses the
location of its computer systems. The massive spread of
refrigerator-sized computers is so vital to Worldspan there is no
logo on the windowless red brick building where it is housed.
</P>
<P>
   In 1998, Worldspan took in $637.3 million in revenue, according
to Global Distribution Systems: Outlook for the 21st Century.
Because it is privately owned, Worldspan isn't obligated to release
earnings information. Blackney said it has posted profits for at
least six years with margins in the double digits.
</P>
<P>
   Rumors have had the company preparing for an initial public
offering, but according to Blackney the company ``has no definite
plans for an IPO.'' He declined to comment further other than to
add, ``I think it is fair to say every company at some point in
time would like access to the public capital markets.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, last year, when any company with remote Internet ties
held an initial public offering, Worldspan kept a low profile. With
what seems to be a solid financial situation and ties to the
Internet, Wall Street would likely welcome an offer.
</P>
<P>
   ``They could certainly sell it to the public at a good price,
and there is no question what the story would be,'' said Nick
Moore, a money manager with California investment firm Jurika &AMP;
Voyles, which has invested in Sabre.
</P>
<P>
   However, Moore added that Worldspan isn't without risks because
some travel sites are structured in a way that would allow them to
switch reservation systems.
</P>
<P>
   Blackney has led Worldspan for just under a year, but he is no
stranger to the travel industry or to technology. He spent 31 years
at United Airlines, where he helped build Apollo, the airline's
computerized reservation system, and was named chief executive of
the division in 1992.
</P>
<P>
   Apollo later merged with rival Galileo, and with that, Blackney
decided to retire from the travel industry. His retirement was
short-lived; in the middle of a 10-month stint as a senior vice
president at the American Medical Association, a recruiter called
with an offer from Worldspan.
</P>
<P>
   ``I saw this as a tremendous opportunity to be there for one
more turn of the screw and one more revolution,'' he said. ``It was
just too good to pass up.''
</P>
<P>
   But as in any revolution, some players are sure to die off.
Competition, access to funding and lack of brand awareness could
push 80 percent of travel Web sites out of business within five
years, according to Bear Stearns.
</P>
<P>
   Blackney agrees the market will weed out some of those clients
but thinks the big names, like priceline and Expedia, are survivors
_ and presumably so is Worldspan.
</P>
<P>
   The market, he said, will continue to shift to online bookings.
``It's up to the consumer to decide how they want to purchase
travel,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We knew the business was going to change, and we could embrace
it or we could fight it.''

 &HT;    Hispanic vote not key in battleground states
 &HT;    By Ken Herman
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   The music was loud and Latino. The message was custom-made for
the crowd packed into Miami's Coconut Grove Convention Center for a
GOP rally.
</P>
<P>
   ``We Hispanics have become the most important electoral block in
the country,'' said George P. Bush, the Mexican-American nephew of
the Republican presidential nominee.
</P>
<P>
   But barring large-scale, last-minute population shifts, George
P. is overstating the case in the current presidential race.
</P>
<P>
   After months of speculation about the Hispanic impact on the
race for the White House, the final six weeks of the battle will be
played out in states _ mostly in the Midwest _ where the Hispanic
vote will be miniscule.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a demographic reality,'' said Rodolfo de la Garza, a
University of Texas government professor and vice president of
research for the Tomas Rivera Policy Institute.
</P>
<P>
   Save for New Mexico, which has only five electoral votes, and
Florida, which has 25 electoral votes and an atypical Hispanic
community, the battleground states are among those with the lowest
percentage of voting-age Hispanics.
</P>
<P>
   Seventy-five percent of the nation's growing Hispanic population
is clustered in five states: California, Texas, New York, Florida
and Illinois. Of those, only Illinois offers anything close to the
dynamic once viewed as a crucial factor in the election: the
ability of Republican George W. Bush to move traditionally
Democratic Hispanics into his column.
</P>
<P>
   Polls show California, New York and Texas are not in play as the
campaign moves into its most critical phase. Democrat Al Gore has a
solid lead in New York, and Bush will probably carry his home
state. Although Bush is battling for California, where the
voting-age population is 28 percent Hispanic, surveys indicate he
is a long shot at best.
</P>
<P>
   The race is much closer in Florida, where Bush is counting on
his brother Jeb, Florida's governor, to help deliver the state.
Florida's voting-age population is 15 percent Hispanic, but it is
atypical because of a large Cuban American population with
longstanding ties to the Republican Party and the Bush family.
</P>
<P>
   Matthew Dowd, who studies poll numbers for the Bush campaign,
notes that demographic changes in Florida's Hispanic community have
made it more difficult for a Republican to carry that state. New
immigration patterns have resulted in a major change in Florida's
Hispanic population: Non-Cuban Hispanics now outnumber Cuban
Hispanics.
</P>
<P>
   Nationwide, People with Cuban background-- make up only 5
percent of the nation's 32 million Hispanics, but they vote
Republican. A recent national poll by Hispanictrends.com, which
gave Gore a 59 percent to 28 percent overall lead among Hispanics,
showed Bush with a whopping 83 percent to 10 percent lead among
Cuban Americans.
</P>
<P>
   Gore, however, has huge leads among Hispanics of Mexican, Puerto
Rican, Dominican, Central American and South American descent.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Hispanic population is not predominant'' in the
battleground states, said a top Bush adviser, adding, however, that
the nominee will continue to try to lure Hispanic votes to show he
is a different kind of Republican. ``It's something we are going to
continue to communicate and talk about no matter where we are.''
</P>
<P>
   That message is important for people such as Jeremy Gonzalez
Ibraham of Philadelphia, who is trying to help the GOP make inroads
in Pennsylvania's growing, though still relatively small, Hispanic
population.
</P>
<P>
   ``Clearly, the strategy we have here in Pennsylvania looks
beyond Nov. 7,'' he said, acknowledging that the Hispanic vote in
his state is relatively small, though potentially powerful. ``To
have an impact doesn't necessarily require you to have large raw
numbers. The question is how many of those numbers you can motivate
to get to the polls and vote for your candidate.''
</P>
<P>
   Dan Fee, spokesman for the Pennsylvania Democratic Party, said
Hispanics are becoming more important in state politics, but can
only make a difference this year if the presidential race in
Pennsylvania is razor thin.
</P>
<P>
   De la Garza, a student of Hispanic voting trends, says that's
generally the case in the battleground states.
</P>
<P>
   ``You've got to have a very, very tight election for small
groups to influence them,'' he said. ``The Anglos would have to be
divided 49.8-49.8. If the majority population is going in one
direction overwhelmingly Latinos don't make much of a difference.
It's only when the majority is divided can Latinos realistically
hope to influence the outcome.''
</P>
<P>
   But de la Garza believes Hispanics _ through Bush's message _
already have effected the presidential race.
</P>
<P>
   ``Issues of cultural division were killed off when Bush reached
out to Latinos,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The ``different kind of a Republican'' tag Bush has hung on
himself has been a crucial part of his campaign since day one.
Depending on whose numbers you believe, Bush carried one-third to
one-half of the Hispanic vote in Texas in his 1998 re-election
campaign.
</P>
<P>
   Bush has continued that effort in the presidential race,
speaking Spanish on the campaign trail, airing Spanish-language
advertisements and distancing himself from GOP immigration
positions unpopular among Hispanics
</P>
<P>
   Though the messageweek gave Gore a 57 percent to 25 percent edge
among Hispanics.
</P>
<P>
   In 1992, the elder George Bush captured only 19 percent of the
Hispanic vote when he was ousted by Democrat Bill Clinton. In 1996,
GOP nominee Bob Dole pulled an anemic 13 percent of the Hispanic
vote.For in-depth reporting, opinion and cartoonists visit the Cox

MICROSOFT CATCHES A BREAK WITH OK ON APPEAL 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By HIAWATHA BRAY  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   The world's richest software company has bought itself some
time.
</P>
<P>
   Tuesday, the US Supreme Court court declined to immediately
review the high-stakes antitrust case filed against Microsoft Corp.
by the US Justice Department and 19 state attorneys general.
Instead, eight of the nine justices agreed the case should follow
the normal appellate process.
</P>
<P>
   That means Microsoft will get two chances to reverse the
stunning defeat handed the company by US District Judge Thomas
Penfield Jackson.
</P>
<P>
   First, Microsoft will get to make its case before the DC Circuit
Court of Appeals, a respected legal panel that has taken
Microsoft's side in earlier skirmishes. Then, Microsoft or the
government can appeal to the Supreme Court, once the lower court
has ruled. In any case, the entire process could delay resolution
of the case by a year or more.
</P>
<P>
   A company spokesman, Jim Cullinan, denied that Microsoft was
eager to drag out the case.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have said all along that, honestly, we believe our appeal
is very strong,'' Cullinan said, ``and think whether it was heard
by the Court of Appeals or the Supreme Court, the District Court's
ruling would be reversed.''
</P>
<P>
   But a Boston antitrust lawyer, Lisa Wood, said Microsoft has
good reason to keep the process moving in slow motion.
</P>
<P>
   ``That gives them longer to compete in an unregulated form,
maybe taking advantage of the business practices that the judge
found problematic,'' Wood said.
</P>
<P>
   She also noted that the computer industry is changing so rapidly
that every month of delay will help Microsoft argue that the
original case against it is no longer relevant.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier this year, Jackson found that Microsoft was a predatory
monopoly that used unfair business practices to crush rival
companies. As punishment, Jackson chose the corporate equivalent of
the death penalty: the breakup of Microsoft into two separate
companies.
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft appealed, but the Justice Department, eager to see
Microsoft's power curbed, wanted to speed up the appeals process.
Citing a rarely used provision of the antitrust laws, Justice
Department lawyers asked the Supreme Court to short-circuit the
usual appeals process and hear the case directly.
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft countered that the case should follow the normal
process. Tuesday, the high court agreed, with only Justice Stephen
Breyer dissenting.
</P>
<P>
   Chief Justice William Rehnquist, in a written statement attached
to the court's brief order, noted that his son works as a partner
for a Boston law firm that is defending Microsoft against private
antitrust lawsuits. But Rehnquist said that he would not recuse
himself because there is ``no reasonable basis to conclude that the
interests of my son or his law firm will be substantially affected
by the proceedings currently before the Supreme Court.''
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft critic Ed Black, president of the Computer &AMP;
Communications Industry Association, a major trade group, said he
was only slightly disappointed by the ruling.
</P>
<P>
   ``We clearly had a preference to have this case go to the
Supreme Court,'' Black said, partly because it would have meant a
quicker end to the matter. ``We'd like to have certainty for the
industry and a positive outcome for consumers.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, Black added, ``at the end of the day, it will not matter
that much, as long as the decision of the trial judge is upheld and
an effective remedy is imposed.''
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft supporter Jonathan Zuck, president of the Association
for Competitive Technology, who expects Microsoft to prevail, said
he was pleased the procedual issue had been settled. ``I'm just
happy that we've gotten through the legal wrangling and we're going
to back to the substance of the case,'' Zuck said.
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft has done well in previous outings at the Appeals
Court. In 1995, the court upheld a consent decree worked out
between Microsoft and the Justice Department to resolve an earlier
antitrust dispute. US District Judge Stanley Sporkin had rejected
the decree, saying it was too lenient toward Microsoft.
</P>
<P>
   In 1998, the Appeals Court overturned a decision by Judge
Jackson, who had ruled that the 1995 consent decree barred
Microsoft from incorporating Internet browsing software in its
Windows operating system. The ruling cleared the way for Microsoft
to begin selling its Windows 98 software.
</P>
<P>
   In a controversial part of the ruling, two of the three judges
wrote that Microsoft had a right to add new features to its
products, even if this harmed competitors, if the new features also
benefitted customers.
</P>
<P>
   The Justice Department had argued that because Microsoft has a
virtual monopoly on desktop computer operating system software, the
inclusion of powerful new features at no charge was simply a way
for Microsoft to crush rivals. The Appeals Court ruling has been
touted by Microsoft as a major blow to the government's case,
evidence that Microsoft is likely to prevail on appeal.
</P>
<P>
   But Wood, an executive of the antitrust section of the American
Bar Association, isn't so sure.
</P>
<P>
   ``What the Appeals Court was responding to before was a very
limited factual record,'' she said. ``This is a very different
situation now. You have a very extensive trial record (and)
detailed fact-finding.''
</P>
<P>
   Wood said the appeals court could well back away from its
previous ruling and uphold Jackson.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, Wood predicted the Appeals Court will hear the case
on an expedited schedule, thus limiting Microsoft's ability to
delay the process.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think the standard, routine schedule is going to apply
to this case,'' Wood said. ``There's nothing standard or routine in
this case.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, the Appeals Court immediately ordered the two sides to
file proposed schedules by Monday, with responses scheduled for
Oct. 5 and final filings by Oct. 10.

 &HT;    SENATE CLEARS HURDLE ON BILL TO EXPAND FOREIGN VISAS
 &HT;    Moving in (w) Washington and (f) financial categories.
 &HT;    By MARILYN GEEWAX
 &HT;    c.2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The U.S. Senate voted 94-3 on Tuesday to advance
legislation that would dramatically increase the number of visas
for high-skilled foreign workers.
</P>
<P>
   Democrats stalled a final vote by continuing to debate a broad
range of immigration issues. But given the nearly unanimous support
on the cloture vote to limit debate on the bill, the expansion of
so-called H-1B visas appears headed for passage in the Senate.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's time we get to a conclusion and have a vote, and I
predict that the final vote on this bill ... will be 90 to 10,''
said Senate Majority Leader Trent Lott, R-Miss.
</P>
<P>
   Passage in the Senate could give the bill the momentum it needs
to become law before Congress adjourns, perhaps as soon as next
week.
</P>
<P>
   The House was awaiting Senate action on the measure, which would
boost the current annual cap on H-1B visas to 195,000 from 115,000.
Tech companies say they need more foreign computer programmers and
engineers to fill numerous vacancies.
</P>
<P>
   ``The House is looking at what is going to happen in the
Senate,'' said Marc Brailov, a spokesman for the American
Electronics Association, a trade group that has been working
vigorously for the bill's passage.
</P>
<P>
   Lott forced the cloture vote, which ended with 40 Democrats
joining 53 Republicans. Lott had already blocked Democrats from
adding their immigration amendments to the bill, so the vote to
limit debate and move toward final passage guaranteed a ``clean''
bill with no controversial riders.
</P>
<P>
   The visa bill is the technology industry's top remaining
priority in Washington for this year at a time when both political
parties are competing for financial backing of the tech industry.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the lopsided cloture vote, Democrats spent hours
discussing other immigration issues, such as granting amnesty to
more than 500,000 mostly Hispanic undocumented immigrants.
</P>
<P>
   Republicans charged that the other immigration issues were being
tossed into the H-1B visa debate to make GOP presidential
candidate, Gov. George W. Bush of Texas, look bad in the eyes of
many Hispanic voters.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think we ought to quit playing politics and do what's right
for this country'' by focusing on raising the visa cap, said Sen.
Orrin Hatch, R-Utah. He said that Democrats did not bring up the
immigration amnesty issue until late July, when Democratic
presidential candidate Al Gore was doing poorly in the polls.
</P>
<P>
   Frustrated with the numerous speeches by Democrats after they
had voted for the procedural motion, Sen. Phil Gramm, R-Texas,
lashed out. ``I don't understand it, you're either for it or
against it,'' he said. ``Let us vote on it. ``
</P>
<P>
   The continuing debate on immigration issues has put the bill in
``never-never land'' on the question of when final Senate passage
will take place, said Lott's spokesman, John Czwartacki. But he
said he believed the bill would come to a vote late this week.

 &HT;    SENATE CLEARS HURDLE ON BILL TO EXPAND FOREIGN VISAS
 &HT;    Moving in (w) Washington and (f) financial categories.
 &HT;    By MARILYN GEEWAX
 &HT;    c.2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The U.S. Senate voted 94-3 on Tuesday to advance
legislation that would dramatically increase the number of visas
for high-skilled foreign workers.
</P>
<P>
   Democrats stalled a final vote by continuing to debate a broad
range of immigration issues. But given the nearly unanimous support
on the cloture vote to limit debate on the bill, the expansion of
so-called H-1B visas appears headed for passage in the Senate.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's time we get to a conclusion and have a vote, and I
predict that the final vote on this bill ... will be 90 to 10,''
said Senate Majority Leader Trent Lott, R-Miss.
</P>
<P>
   Passage in the Senate could give the bill the momentum it needs
to become law before Congress adjourns, perhaps as soon as next
week.
</P>
<P>
   The House was awaiting Senate action on the measure, which would
boost the current annual cap on H-1B visas to 195,000 from 115,000.
Tech companies say they need more foreign computer programmers and
engineers to fill numerous vacancies.
</P>
<P>
   ``The House is looking at what is going to happen in the
Senate,'' said Marc Brailov, a spokesman for the American
Electronics Association, a trade group that has been working
vigorously for the bill's passage.
</P>
<P>
   Lott forced the cloture vote, which ended with 40 Democrats
joining 53 Republicans. Lott had already blocked Democrats from
adding their immigration amendments to the bill, so the vote to
limit debate and move toward final passage guaranteed a ``clean''
bill with no controversial riders.
</P>
<P>
   The visa bill is the technology industry's top remaining
priority in Washington for this year at a time when both political
parties are competing for financial backing of the tech industry.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the lopsided cloture vote, Democrats spent hours
discussing other immigration issues, such as granting amnesty to
more than 500,000 mostly Hispanic undocumented immigrants.
</P>
<P>
   Republicans charged that the other immigration issues were being
tossed into the H-1B visa debate to make GOP presidential
candidate, Gov. George W. Bush of Texas, look bad in the eyes of
many Hispanic voters.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think we ought to quit playing politics and do what's right
for this country'' by focusing on raising the visa cap, said Sen.
Orrin Hatch, R-Utah. He said that Democrats did not bring up the
immigration amnesty issue until late July, when Democratic
presidential candidate Al Gore was doing poorly in the polls.
</P>
<P>
   Frustrated with the numerous speeches by Democrats after they
had voted for the procedural motion, Sen. Phil Gramm, R-Texas,
lashed out. ``I don't understand it, you're either for it or
against it,'' he said. ``Let us vote on it. ``
</P>
<P>
   The continuing debate on immigration issues has put the bill in
``never-never land'' on the question of when final Senate passage
will take place, said Lott's spokesman, John Czwartacki. But he
said he believed the bill would come to a vote late this week.

PRAGUE TAKEN ABACK BY FEROCITY OF DEMONSTRATORS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By BRIAN WHITMORE  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   PRAGUE _ From the middle of their street, Martin Palan and Honza
Novak stood stunned Tuesday as black-clad demonstrators pelted
police with rocks and firebombs, set barricades ablaze and later
smashed windows at a McDonald's, banks and a Mercedes dealership.
</P>
<P>
   The whir of police helicopters and wafting black smoke and
teargas was reminiscent of protests past in Prague, broken up by
Soviet tanks or ending in triumph with the fall of the hated
communist rulers.
</P>
<P>
   But Tuesday, as up to 9,000 people, mostly foreign, sought to
prolong the cry against global capitalism, Palan and Novak felt
outrage and anger toward those who were stripping the cobblestones
from Prague's historic streets to hurl at police. By Tuesday night,
scores of people were injured.
</P>
<P>
   ``I respect everybody's right to express their opinions,'' said
Palan, a 20-year-old student, ``but people should not come here, to
our country, to destroy things.''
</P>
<P>
   Those protesting Tuesday's opening of an International Monetary
Fund and World Bank meeting included environmentalists, human
rights activists, and labor groups. But also present _ and much
more visible _ were radicals of various stripes including
anarchists, communists and right-wing skinheads.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is a paradox. A decade ago our people demonstrated
peacefully and successfully against Communism. Now there are
foreigners coming here waving Communist flags demonstrating
violently against capitalism, '' said Novak, 20. ``They don't know
what it means to live under Communism.''
</P>
<P>
   The number of protesters was less than half the 20,000 that
organizers had hoped to gather. Authorities, determined to prevent
the violence that erupted at world trade talks in Seattle last
year, kept hundreds of people with arrest records from entering the
country.
</P>
<P>
   In trying to storm the financiers' meeting, activists pelted
police with bottles, rocks and firebombs. Police fought back with
teargas and water cannons. Several stick-wielding protesters got
within yards of the Prague Congress Center, where the meetings are
being held, injuring a Japanese and Russian delegate. They also
stormed a hotel, pelting delegates with rocks until
truncheon-wielding police repelled them.
</P>
<P>
   Protesters had hoped to barricade IMF and World Bank officials
inside their meetings. But at the end of the day, police herded the
delegates into a subway station, where they boarded specially
prepared trains.
</P>
<P>
   President Vaclav Havel, a playwright who led a bloodless
revolution that overthrew Czechoslovakia's Communist government in
1989, called on protesters to end the violence. IMF and World Bank
officials said the annual meetings, which conclude Thursday, would
continue on schedule.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're really disappointed. We were really hoping for a
non-violent protest on the basic issues of the IMF and the World
Bank. But instead now the focus has shifted,'' said Chelsea Mosen,
of the Initiative Against Economic Globalization.
</P>
<P>
   Other demonstrators said the violence should show Czechs _ and
the world _ how angry people are about the policies of IMF and the
World Bank. The two organizations, they say, perpetuate poverty in
developing countries by forcing them to cut social programs in
order to receive loans.
</P>
<P>
   ``Today people trashed some sidewalks and broke some windows.
The IMF destroys entire countries, '' said Genevieve Moore, 23, a
native of Seattle and a veteran of the Seattle protests.
</P>
<P>
   But most locals were unimpressed by such logic.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am so frustrated that I could just kill them,'' said Andrea
Macurova, 25, wiping tear gas from her eyes and tried to make her
way home around police barricades. ``They are a bunch of idiots and
they should just leave our city.``

NBA SECURITY MONITORING PIERCE STABBING 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By PETER MAY  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   The investigation into the stabbing of Celtics guard/forward
Paul Pierce will be closely monitored by NBA security. While many
of the league's security personnel are in Sydney for the Olympics,
the NBA maintains a security presence in all of its cities,
generally people with a background in law enforcement.
</P>
<P>
   League spokesman Seth Sylvan said the customary procedure after
an incident such as the Pierce stabbing would be for the security
person to check in with the local police. The individual would have
access to police records and reports and would update the league as
the investigation proceeds.
</P>
<P>
   When Pierce recovers, there also is the likelihood that the NBA
will talk to him, Sylvan said &UR;  &LR; Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   The Celtics notified the league once they learned of the
stabbing but have had no further contact with NBA officials, said
Rich Pond, the team's chief financial officer. But Pond noted that
neither the league nor the team can do much, given that the
incident occurred at a nightclub.
</P>
<P>
   ``Ultimately,'' Pond said, ``the player is responsible for
himself. If we get any further information, we'll funnel it to
them.''
</P>
<P>
   Pond also noted that the scarcity of medical information being
dispensed is a direct outgrowth of the Reggie Lewis situation.
After Lewis's death, the NBA amended its bylaws to give players the
final say in the dispensing of private medical information. (This
does not include injuries suffered in a game.)
</P>
<P>
   As of Tuesday, the Pierce family did not want to disclose any
medical information.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's in their hands,'' Pond said. ``If there is any
information to be released, we will be the conduit.''
</P>
<P>
   The NBA Players Association also is keeping an eye on the
investigation, but from afar, as its chief security man is in
Sydney. When he returns, he will check with league security
officials and the Boston Police in a routine followup procedure,
said union spokesman Dan Wasserman.

&HT;     CELEBRATION COSTS NINER A WEEK'S PLAY 
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 &HT;     By MICHELLE SMITH  
 &HT;     c.2000 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SANTA CLARA, Calif. _ With steely eyes and a furrowed brow, San
Francisco 49ers coach Steve Mariucci resembled a disappointed
father forced to mete out a painful punishment to his wayward
child.
</P>
<P>
   But Terrell Owens didn't lose the keys to the car or the
privilege of playing with his video games for a week. He paid a
much heftier price for his nationally televised misbehavior in
Sunday's 41-24 win over Dallas.
</P>
<P>
   Owens has been grounded. The 49ers' leading receiver has been
banned from the team for one week. No practices. No meetings. No
film sessions. No game on Sunday against the Arizona Cardinals. And
no paycheck for that game.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a decision based on how we intend to conduct ourselves
here as football players and represent this organization,''
Mariucci said Monday in announcing Owens' banishment, which will
cost him $24,294.
</P>
<P>
   It is not technically a suspension because Owens will not be
removed from the 53-man roster. But semantics aside, the message
was clearly communicated: Behavior such as Owens' will not be
tolerated.
</P>
<P>
   The entire 49ers organization is recoiling from the backlash of
a display that was fodder for highlight reels and sport talk shows
around the nation on Sunday night and Monday morning.
</P>
<P>
   There it was, for everyone to see, replayed over and over thanks
to the magic of videotape _ Owens' two blatantly antagonistic
touchdown celebrations on the big blue star in the middle of Texas
Stadium, as well as his postgame statements, in which he showed an
utter lack of contrition. In fact, he said he would do it again,
despite the clear disapproval of his coach and many of his
teammates.
</P>
<P>
   Mariucci said Owens' suspension was a result of his actions on
the field but that his postgame statements ``certainly didn't help
matters.''
</P>
<P>
   Owens apologized to his teammates in the locker room after the
game. And then, in speaking with reporters, he refused to offer
regret for his actions. Mariucci was asked if Owens explained that
contradiction.
</P>
<P>
   ``Not well enough,'' he said shortly.
</P>
<P>
   Owens angrily left the team facility after his meeting with
Mariucci, according to team officials, and headed home to Alabama.
He released a statement through his agent, David Joseph. It did not
include an apology.
</P>
<P>
   Owens said he ``felt badly'' that his actions ``detracted from
what was a great team victory over the Cowboys.
</P>
<P>
   ``As most of you know, I am an intense and emotional player who
is driven to succeed. I also want to make clear that my actions
were not intended to taunt or insult the Dallas Cowboys
organization; rather I was simply tying to provide my team with a
positive spark. Finally, after the game, I stated that I would do
the celebration again, but by making that statement, I simply
intended to show that I believed my action would be a positive to
the team.''
</P>
<P>
   Owens' teammates were informed of the team's decision before
Monday's afternoon practice.
</P>
<P>
   ``That came as a shock to me,'' said rookie linebacker Julian
Peterson, who added he didn't think Owens should be penalized. ``I
had no idea he was going to get suspended or anything like that.
It's tough. All he was doing was going on emotion, but I guess it
was considered taunting.''
</P>
<P>
   Other players saw it as a decision made by the people with
offices upstairs.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wasn't really surprised, but I can't speak for anybody
else,'' tight end Greg Clark said. ``In a way, it's good they are
putting their foot down and saying how they want the organization
to be run.''
</P>
<P>
   Owens will probably not be punished by the NFL. The team
informed the league about its action, and this will likely be the
extent of it. According a league spokesman, it is a violation of
the collective bargaining agreement for a player to be fined twice.
Thus, it would appear the 49ers got to Owens before the NFL could.
</P>
<P>
   Owens will not be in uniform when San Francisco hosts Arizona on
Sunday. Owens leads the 49ers with 23 catches, 328 yards and four
touchdowns. His absence may be costly for a team that has won just
one game in four tries but has a good chance on its home field
against a 1-2 Arizona team.

COMPAQ BETTING $100 MILLION ON GENOMICS INDUSTRY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By NAOMI AOKI  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Compaq Computer Corp. will invest $100 million in early-stage
life sciences companies in hopes of capitalizing on the genomics
industry's burgeoning demand for high-performance computing.
</P>
<P>
   As the first part of that investment, Compaq said it has already
dedicated a ``significant'' sum to Applied Genomic Technology
Capital Fund, a Cambridge, Mass. venture capital fund specializing
in genomics and bioinformatics start-ups. It did not disclose the
amount of the investment.
</P>
<P>
   Compaq will put some of the $100 million directly in companies
and some in venture capital funds like AGTC that target the
genomics and bioinformatics fields. The company said its goal is to
spur the growth of discovery in life sciences and strengthen the
company's foothold in the industry.
</P>
<P>
   ``This field is truly a revolutionary field,'' said Ty Rabe, the
company's director of high-performance technical computing
solutions. ``Not only is there a huge focus in the near term to
develop drugs, diagnostics, and therapeutics, but in the long-term
there will be applications for crops, materials, and information
technology.''
</P>
<P>
   Rabe said he believes many of those advances will come from
today's start-ups. Celera Genomics, the Maryland company that
earlier this year announced it had decoded the human genome,
started with one Compaq high-performance system and grew to a
network of 700 systems in less than 18 months, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Compaq, one of the world's largest suppliers of computing
systems, provides high-performance computing, data storage, and
information management products and services. The company began
working with genomics companies and research institutions more than
four years ago and now has relationships with renowned groups like
Celera, the Sanger Centre in England, and the Whitehead Research
Institute in Cambridge.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have established a leadership position working with large
research institutions and companies,'' Rabe said. ``But we needed a
more aggressive and proactive way to reach start-ups in the
field.''
</P>
<P>
   Rabe said start-up companies would be expected to purchase
Compaq's systems and services when Compaq invests in them. No such
agreement is required when Compaq invests in companies indirectly
through venture capital funds, Rabe said.
</P>
<P>
   As the genomics field has advanced, it has become increasingly
dependent on computing systems that can process, store, and analyze
massive amounts of data at breakneck speeds. Analysts estimate that
spending by genomics companies on information technology will match
or exceed the industry's revenue growth.
</P>
<P>
   ``Biology is now largely an information science,'' said Noubar
Afeyan, managing partner of the AGTC fund. ``It faces significant
computational challenges.''
</P>
<P>
   Celera's work to map the human genome is a good example, Afeyan
said. The company took human DNA, chopped it up into millions of
pieces, examined them, and then put them back together like pieces
of a puzzle. The company used computers, he said, to systematically
match each piece to millions of other pieces to see which
overlapped.
</P>
<P>
   Other companies, Afeyan said, are using computers to identify
gene variations that affect how individuals respond to drugs and
other medical treatments. Until a couple of years ago, he said,
researchers didn't even know the variations existed. Now, he said,
they are scanning more than 3 billion segments of DNA to spot the
roughly 5 million variations that distinguish one person from
another.
</P>
<P>
   ``All of this and more is being feverishly developed in the
industry,'' Afeyan said. ``We can help Compaq identify the up-
and-coming companies, give them access and visibility in the field.
And Compaq can help the companies by providing leading- edge IT
solutions to these significant computational challenges.''

NORTH AND SOUTH KOREA AGREE TO LIMITED REOPENING OF DEMILITARIZED
ZONE 
</HEADLINE>
   By HOWARD W. FRENCH   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   CHEJU, South Korea _ North and South Korea agreed Tuesday to a
limited reopening of the demilitarized zone that separates the
countries to repair a railway link that has been severed for more
than 50 years.
</P>
<P>
   The agreement, announced at the first talks between the two
sides' defense ministers since the Korean War, is the highest level
confirmation of the reconciliation between the two countries since
a historic summit meeting in June in Pyongyang, the North Korean
capital.
</P>
<P>
   Seeming to overcome the initial reticence of the North to
include anything other than rail reconstruction on the agenda for
these talks, the defense ministers, Gen. Kim Il Chol for the North
and Cho Seong-tae for the South, agreed to ``working level''
military talks. Those talks are to start next month, followed in
November by a second round of ministerial meetings in Pyongyang.
</P>
<P>
   Lt. Gen. Kim Hee-sang, a spokesman for the South Korean defense
forces, said the two sides had agreed to discuss in future meetings
the creation of a hot line that would link the two military
commands. South Korea had also pushed for mutual notification of
major troop movements and for observations of each other's military
exercises.
</P>
<P>
   At another meeting held simultaneously in Seoul, finance
ministers from both countries reached an accord on legal
protections for South Korean companies that invest in the
economically devastated North. Additionally, South Korea said it
would provide the North with 600,000 tons of food aid, in loans, in
the next year. The aid, worth $97 million, is the latest of several
grants of economic assistance from the South since the two
countries' presidents met in June.
</P>
<P>
   Reopening the long-severed railway has emerged as one of the
reconciliation's few potential short-term economic payoffs for the
South. Seoul has already committed $444.8 million to repair the
track and build a 12-mile-long highway across the 4-mile-wide DMZ.
Cooperation from the North Korean military is indispensable,
though, because the 4-mile-wide area has up to 1 million land
mines.
</P>
<P>
   ``Getting these links open would be a big boost to the process
of reconciliation,'' one diplomat said. ``It would prove there is a
real willingness to work on common problems, and furthermore it
would give South Korea its first land link with the rest of Asia.''

GORE TARGETS THE MTV GENERATION 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By LYNDA GOROV  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   ANN ARBOR, Mich. _ She is a business marketing major who sings
lead with an alternative rock band named Joygirl, a college senior
who complains that politicians cater too much to older folks. Sara
Sonstein said she wants them to address her concerns, too.
</P>
<P>
   Tuesday, at least briefly, Vice President Al Gore did.
</P>
<P>
   Before returning to his stump speech staples of late _ Medicare,
Social Security, prescription drug payments _ Gore stopped at the
University of Michigan campus to tape an MTV program called ``Total
Request Live,'' part of the network's ``Choose or Lose'' campaign
to get young people to vote. The hourlong program gave Gore a
chance to connect with a group of eligible voters who often don't
vote, feeling too busy, too bored, or too disconnected to bother.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think people my age feel really helpless that politicians
don't speak to us, that they don't talk about what we care about,''
Sonstein, who attends Eastern Michigan University, said before the
taping. ``I don't think my vote doesn't matter, but a lot of young
people don't vote so there isn't any unity to give us the power
that would make politicians pay more attention to us.''
</P>
<P>
   That political Catch-22 was cited again and again by many of the
175 or so students waiting to question Gore on the University of
Michigan at Ann Arbor campus. Less than a third of eligible
18-to-24 year olds voted in the 1996 presidential election, census
studies show. Less than half of them plan to cast a ballot in
November, according to a recent survey by MTV and the Kaiser Family
Foundation. Turnout, already low and apparently dropping, tends to
render young people invisible as a voting target, whether the
candidate is Gore or his opponent George W. Bush, who is weighing a
similar MTV appearance.
</P>
<P>
   ``The national debt does apply to us, but not on a daily basis,
not in a way we think about a lot,'' said James Farchone, 20, a
Bush supporter who is majoring in mechanical engineering. ``So does
Social Security, I guess, but that's not what we're thinking about
right now.''
</P>
<P>
   Added James Henaham, 20, another Bush backer and engineering
major, ``I feel sometimes they're not in touch with us and then
when they do try to talk to us, they try too hard. The age gap is
just way too huge.''
</P>
<P>
   The students, however, did accept some of the blame for
themselves.
</P>
<P>
   One after another said many of them can't find the time to pay
attention to politics. They're too busy doing homework or
downloading music over the Internet or generally contending with
the demanding business of being young, they said.
</P>
<P>
   As Rachel Stiegel, a 20-year-old who calls herself a libertarian
and plans to vote for Gore, put it, ``Some people think politics
just isn't cool. There are so many other, better things to do with
your time.''
</P>
<P>
   Said Daniel Allen, 20, another aspiring mechanical engineer who
wants Bush in the White House, ``They do try to talk about
education, but I'm so busy with education that I haven't had a
chance to follow what they're saying.''
</P>
<P>
   Almost everyone raised what many called the ``disconnect''
between national politics and their own lives in dormitories or
small off-campus apartments. Allen, for instance, said local or
campus involvement can yield more direct and visible results. Sarah
Loope, a 24-year-old law student who supports Gore's pro-choice
stance, noted that the young often feel their votes would make no
difference in the country's direction. She said she feels hers
does.
</P>
<P>
   ``People basically feel that politicians are out for older
people and not the people of this generation,'' said Benjamin
Madden, 18 and undecided on his major but certain that he will vote
for Gore. ``I guess we haven't done a good job of making ourselves
heard.''
</P>
<P>
   The students, Democrat and Republican alike, applauded Gore's
willingness to stand before students and give unscripted, if not
unexpected, answers to their prescreened questions. The death
penalty, gay rights, environmental protections, racial profiling by
police, abortion rights, the legality of the music file-sharing
service known as Napster, and the high cost of a college education
were all raised.
</P>
<P>
   No one asked whether Gore preferred boxers or briefs _ a
question put to President Clinton when he appeared on the in 1994 _
but Sonstein, part of the prescreened audience, did raise the issue
of classroom inequities between rich and poor districts. Gore, in a
sage green dress shirt but no tie, responded with talk of raising
teachers' pay, holding them accountable, and providing the
resources that would let them do their job.
</P>
<P>
   If elected, Gore promised to hold regular ``youth forums''
around the country. He vowed to make a ban on racial profiling
``the first civil rights act of the 21st Century.'' He said he
supports civil unions for gays, but declined to say whether he
would give foreigners who fall in love with gays in the United
States the same emigration rights afforded heterosexuals who marry.
He called Napster ``a terrific innovation,'' but said artists'
rights have to be protected. He reitereated his opposition to
censorship while noting that he abhors rap and other lyrics that
demean certain groups or promote violence.
</P>
<P>
   The audience also learned Gore's grocery checkout preference: He
prefers paper over plastic. His CD collection includes Sister
Hazel, a mainstream pop group and a safe choice. Working the crowd
before the cameras went on, he declined to sign a young woman's
arm, saying ``I don't sign skin.'' Gore laughed when a brief filmed
biography described the convention kiss between him and his wife as
a PDA _ public display of affection. But a mention that he once
smoked ``the herb,'' or marijuana, brought no smile, only silence.
</P>
<P>
   The students were polite, clapping at times, laughing at others.
But the enthusiasm was tepid compared with the greeting Green Party
candidate Ralph Nader recently received in nearby Flint. Almost 850
people turned out to hear him speak. One student even asked Gore
whether a vote for Nader would in fact be a vote for Bush. Gore
said he could not answer that one.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of young people are mad that there are only two
parties'' in the presidential debates,'' Stiegel said. ``The
Democrats and Republicans are like Coke and Pepsi. Young people
really want another channel to tune into.''

YUGOSLAV PRESIDENT SAYS VOTE REQUIRES RUNOFF 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JOHN DONNELLY  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Despite assertions by the Yugoslav opposition and
by world leaders that Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic lost
Sunday's vote, his electoral machinery insists he and challenger
Vojislav Kostunica would head into a runoff vote in two weeks.
</P>
<P>
   Opposition candidate Vojislav Kostunica, however, stuck to his
claim of outright victory and rejected a runoff vote as an
``insult'' to voters. In cities across Yugoslavia Tuesday night,
thousands of people agreed with Kostunica, banging pots and pans
and shouting anti-Milosevic chants in spontanteous street protests
against the government commission's decision.
</P>
<P>
   Despite his angry tone and the nationwide protests, Kostunica
said the opposition would avoid ``careless moves which could raise
tensions in society. ... The truth is obvious and we will defend it
by all nonviolent means.''
</P>
<P>
   The Clinton administration and European governments rejected the
electoral commission's estimates and the runoff declaration.
</P>
<P>
   ``The failure to award a first-round victory for the opposition
is highly suspect, given the other credible reports that came out
of the polling,'' White House spokesman Joe Lockhart told
reporters.
</P>
<P>
   Milosevic and his administration ``are not yet ready to give up
the ghost, but they haven't yet figured out what to do,'' said a
senior US official, speaking on condition of anonymity.
</P>
<P>
   Nonetheless, the surprising announcement, which came only hours
after the regime's State Election Commission said there would be no
results until Thursday, further weakened Milosevic. Some said it
foreshadows his end.
</P>
<P>
   ``The basic fact from all of this is that Milosevic is
finished,'' said Eric Gordy, a Clark University sociology professor
and author of ``The Culture of Power in Serbia.'' ``The only thing
we don't know is how long that will be clear to the people in
power.''
</P>
<P>
   Charles A. Kupchan, a senior fellow at the Council on Foreign
Relations, basically agreed. ``I'm convinced that Milosevic is on
the way out because things are flying apart all around him,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   Even among those who still believed Milosevic had some room to
extend his 13 years in power, the next few days were seen to be
critical in determining whether he still had the support of the
police and army.
</P>
<P>
   The commission asserted that Kostunica, a university law
professor, received 48 percent of the vote and Milosevic 40
percent. The commission called its results ``preliminary.'' It said
64 percent of registered voters cast ballots, compared to estimates
of 74 percent by the opposition.
</P>
<P>
   If a runoff is held, the momentum has clearly swung against
Milosevic, analysts agree. And after giving the opposition and
independent election monitors time to collect their own tallies _
both give Kostunica roughly 55 percent of the vote _ it was unclear
how Milosevic would fare better in a second vote.
</P>
<P>
   ``It sounds as though he's trying to practice politics of the
previous era, and foster some sort of division between the
opposition,'' said Andrew C. Hess, professor of diplomacy at Tufts
University's Fletcher School of Law and Diplomacy. ``He's stalling
for time to figure out if it's possible to do that.''
</P>
<P>
   Tuesday that option seemed unlikely.
</P>
<P>
   Said Vladan Batic, leader of the Serb Democratic Christian
Party: ``There is no second round of presidential elections ...
because our candidate won in the first round. We have material
evidence to prove it.''
</P>
<P>
   Added Zoran Djindjic, president of the Democratic Party: ``The
preliminary results are but a provocation made by the regime.''
</P>
<P>
   In addition, Serb Orhtodox Church Patriarch Pavle met with
Kostunica and said afterward: ``I hope that the ruling parties will
accept the electoral will of the people.''
</P>
<P>
   More pointedly, he also appealed to the army and police to
``defend the interests of people and state, and not of an
individual.''
</P>
<P>
   In Washington, just minutes before the commission anounced its
results, President Clinton said it was clear that the opposition
had won.
</P>
<P>
   ``Despite the government's attempts to manipulate the vote, it
does seem clear that the people have voted for change,'' Clinton
said in a speech at Georgetown University.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton reiterated his administration's offer _ echoed by
European governments Tuesday _ that sanctions would be lifted
against the Serbian people if the election results were upheld.
</P>
<P>
   ``If the will of the people is respected, the doors to Europe
and the world will be open again to Serbia. We will take steps with
our allies to lift economic sanctions, and the people of Serbia,
who have suffered so much finally will have a chance to lead normal
lives,'' Clinton said.
</P>
<P>
   The sanctions,include blocking international bank loans to
Yugoslavia, an oil embargo and denying visas to Yugoslav officials.
</P>
<P>
   But with the opposition party's disagreement with US and NATO
policy in Kosovo, where a NATO air war dislodged Serb troops more
than a year ago, Clinton said it would take time for a new
democratic government in Yugoslavia to establish normal relations
with the West.
</P>
<P>
   The US administration carefully worded its reaction to the
electoral commission. Lockhart said the administation would wait
until vote numbers were final and ``take a cue from the opposition
to see what their intentions and plans are.''
</P>
<P>
   In the the Yugoslav republic of Montenegro, however, the
pro-Western government didn't hesitate at all to criticize the
announcement of a runoff election.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's buying time but I think everything will be in vain and
that the opposition would be making a huge, huge mistake by
accepting,'' deputy Prime Minister Dragisa Burzan told Reuters.

PROTESTERS DISRUPT IMF MEETING IN PRAGUE 
</HEADLINE>
   By   JOSEPH KAHN   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   PRAGUE, Czech Republic _ Black-masked protesters hurled
cobblestones ripped from Prague's medieval streets and attacked
police with homemade gasoline bombs on Tuesday, trying desperately
_ but unsuccessfully _ to shut down the global finance meeting
here.
</P>
<P>
   The riot police had to escort government ministers attending the
annual conference of the International Monetary Fund and the World
Bank into special subways cars to whisk them away from their
meeting at the end of the session, though by evening, normal access
had been fully restored.
</P>
<P>
   The violence, which both police and many protesters said was
provoked by squadrons of European anarchists and communists, did
not stop the meetings.
</P>
<P>
   But it did train the media spotlight on the protesters, who had
vowed to re-create the blockade of the trade talks last year in
Seattle.
</P>
<P>
   Inside the halls, financial leaders who are here to discuss aid
policies tried to show that they are at least as passionate about
the poor as the protesters are. Many pledged to re-dedicate
themselves to fighting poverty, even to inspiring a new
spirituality.
</P>
<P>
   Everyone seemed to cite the statistic that 3 billion people live
on $2 or less a day.
</P>
<P>
   ``Something is wrong when the richest 20 percent of the global
population receive more than 80 percent of the global income,''
James D. Wolfensohn, the president of the World Bank, said in his
keynote address. ``Our challenge is to make globalization an
instrument of opportunity and inclusion _ not fear.''
</P>
<P>
   The leaders of the World Bank and the IMF, and finance ministers
from some rich nations that back them, promoted new plans. They
said they would speed up debt relief, allow poor countries to have
more say in how lending programs are designed and consider
replacing some loans with outright grants.
</P>
<P>
   But by afternoon, protesters had stolen the show, at least as
far as the television cameras were concerned. The demonstrators
included Czech anarchists, Italian Communists, British
schoolteachers and German truck drivers, many of whom contended
that the lending agencies are the problem, not the solution.
</P>
<P>
   The Prague police had prepared for a siege, with 11,000 officers
stationed around the city. In the end, police estimated there were
6,000 demonstrators. The protesters, who once expected 20,000,
claimed they actually had 10,000. Even if they were right, they
still failed to match police one for one, and they fell short of
the tally in Seattle and at some other recent anti-globalization
protests.
</P>
<P>
   Early in the day, in what has become a signature act of
vandalism, several people smashed the windows and tore up the
interior of a McDonald's in Wenceslas Square, the site of the
peaceful protests during Czechoslovakia's Velvet Revolution in
1989.
</P>
<P>
   Near the hilltop Congress Center, where the meetings were held,
a small group of demonstrators hurled fist-sized stones at the
police. Some protesters wore black masks and carried the
red-and-black flag of anarchists. Several threw Molotov cocktails,
igniting the uniforms of officers stretched in a line across the
street.
</P>
<P>
   The police responded with repeated shots of tear gas and sprayed
water from cannons to disperse the crowd, while armored personnel
carriers raced into position to close off the streets.
</P>
<P>
   Police said as many as 65 people were taken to hospitals with
injuries, most of them officers. There were dozens of arrests. A
few demonstrators were hurt by the police who seized them, with one
man bleeding from the face after four officers threw him to the
ground.
</P>
<P>
   The skirmishes spread to the valley below the meeting hall,
where demonstrators burned barricades of wood and tires to keep
police back, then smashed windows and destroyed a car. An American
flag was burned, while protesters yelled, ``No new world order.''
</P>
<P>
   Tomas, a 19-year-old from the Moravia region of the Czech
Republic, threw plastic bottles at the police. ``I hate the police
and they hate me,'' he said. ``I would like some real fighting to
happen.''
</P>
<P>
   A 23-year-old man from Berlin who refused to give his name
carried several cobblestones as he prepared to rush police lines.
He removed his black mask to reveal his face, seared red from
pepper gas.
</P>
<P>
   ``To fight them for me is symbolic of fighting the IMF, which
will never change on its own,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   But many protesters decried the violence.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're really disappointed,'' said Chelsea Mosen, an organizer.
``We were really hoping for a nonviolent protest on the basic
issues of the IMF and the World Bank, but instead now the focus has
shifted to the streets of Prague.''
</P>
<P>
   Though they attracted less attention, delegates at the meetings
from developing countries also challenged the lending agencies and
wealthier governments to improve their policies.
</P>
<P>
   Trevor A. Manuel, South Africa's finance minister and the
honorary chairman of this year's meetings, scolded the
representatives of wealthy nations for pressuring poor nations to
embrace free markets while often protecting their own markets from
the goods that developing countries produce.
</P>
<P>
   ``The robust state of the global economy is due in no small
measure to the success of the fundamental reforms undertaken by
developing countries,'' Manuel said. ``Their boldness needs to be
matched by the richer countries.''
</P>
<P>
   U.S. Treasury Secretary Lawrence Summers, who addressed the
opening ceremonies early in the day, prodded the World Bank to
spend more on human development projects, including education. Such
proposals have met some resistance on the bank's board.
</P>
<P>
   It was left to Vaclav Havel, the Czech president and former
dissident, to try to reconcile the demands of protesters with the
money controlled by the ministers. He asked whether all the
proposals to increase material well-being had obscured the task of
improving spiritual health.
</P>
<P>
   ``We often hear about the need to restructure the economies of
the poorer countries and about the wealthier nations being duty
bound to help them accomplish this,'' Havel said. ``But I deem it
even more important that we should begin also to think about
another restructuring _ a restructuring of the entire system of
values that forms the basis of our civilization today.'' &QL;

SEC CHANGES RULES ON INSIDER STOCK SALES
</HEADLINE>
 By GEANNE ROSENBERG   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The crests and troughs in the AVT Corp.'s stock price are enough
to bring on a bad case of sea sickness.
</P>
<P>
   That complicates life for Roger Fukai, the company's interim
chief executive, whose fortunes have been tied to AVT, a maker of
communications software in Kirkland, Wash., ever since he left the
safety of a large corporation in 1988 for ``plenty of risk'' and a
boatload of stock options.
</P>
<P>
   Like many corporate insiders at small high-technology companies,
Fukai, AVT's longtime chief financial officer, eventually found
himself with most of his wealth in his company's securities but
with many restrictions on how and when he could turn them into
cash.
</P>
<P>
   Fukai was only allowed to trade during ``window periods'' that
lasted for just a few weeks after the release of quarterly
financial results, and only when no major market-affecting news
like an acquisition was on the horizon. Trading before such
knowledge becomes public can violate federal insider trading law.
</P>
<P>
   Now, a little-noticed Securities and Exchange Commission rule
that will go into effect next month should make it easier for Fukai
and others like him to sell their companies' stock without running
afoul of insider-trading law. The rule will allow insiders and
other investors, such as top executives, board members or key
advisers, to buy or sell stock in their companies no matter how
much inside information they have.
</P>
<P>
   The catch: the trades must be made under plans created before
the investors knew about developments that could push up or drag
down the stock.
</P>
<P>
   While the new provision could theoretically affect many of the
estimated 16 million Americans who own shares in the companies they
work for, its biggest impact will be on senior managers eager to
unlock the wealth of their stock-and-options riches without veering
into legal trouble.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Fukai, for one, welcomes the change. ``Insiders will be able to
spend their time managing their business rather than explaining
normal wealth-diversification trades to outside investors,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   And the investing public should also gain, securities law
experts say, because illegal insider trading should be easier to
prosecute. ``The new rule lets the commission go after the people
who really do have evil in their hearts,'' said John F. Olson, a
senior partner in the Washington office of the law firm of Gibson,
Dunn &AMP; Crutcher.
</P>
<P>
   The plan must either specify the number of shares to be bought
or sold on specified dates, or else provide a written formula or
computer program for future trading. An insider can also relinquish
control over trading decisions to someone who does not have inside
information.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   For example, an executive could put in writing his intention to
sell 100 shares of company stock the first trading day of every
month to pay for his children's college educations. Then, even if
he later learned of merger negotiations that could make the stock
soar, or of possible accounting irregularities that could pummel
it, the sales would be legal.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   The new rule was approved by the SEC in August as an addition to
the regulations that fall under the Securities Exchange Act of
1934. It is the first SEC rule that specifically addresses illegal
insider trading. Until now, the agency has relied upon a more
general rule on securities fraud coupled with case law, said Meyer
Eisenberg, the SEC's deputy general counsel.
</P>
<P>
   Christian J. Mixter, a former chief litigation counsel for the
SEC's enforcement division, said of the new arrangement, ``If you
comply, you're OK.''
</P>
<P>
   The trading plans could allow corporate insiders to bolster
their chances of getting more cash for their securities over time
by providing for the sale of more shares when prices are higher and
fewer when prices are lower, said David Furbush, a lawyer with
Brobeck, Phleger &AMP; Harrison in Palo Alto, Calif.
</P>
<P>
   Corporate lawyers, company compliance officers and others are
only now beginning to consider the ramifications.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   At the Intel Corp., management intends to look at the
alternatives under the new rule ``and decide whether they'll be
willing to let people take advantage of them,'' said spokeswoman
Cary I. Klafter. Securities firms are also studying the potential
applications.
</P>
<P>
   The interest is perhaps strongest in Silicon Valley, where
overnight Internet millionaires are especially eager to cash out
some of their holdings. ``We've had a lot of interest in selling
plans by management and founders of companies,'' said Furbush of
Brobeck, Phleger.
</P>
<P>
   ``I absolutely see it as giving birth to an industry,'' said
David Priebe, a partner at Wilson Sonsini Goodrich &AMP; Rosati, also
in Palo Alto.
</P>
<P>
   The rule has not received much attention partly because it was
overshadowed by a related provision that banned companies from
giving important information and specific guidance on future
developments to analysts and professional investors before
releasing it to the public.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   The SEC's new stipulations for trading plans could inspire
companies to release executives and other employees from the
``window of opportunity'' approach that many adopted to avoid even
the appearance of illegal insider trading. (Some executives have
previously given up control of their trading through trusts and
other legal devices to avoid facing insider charges, but could
never be sure that the arrangements would give them 100 percent
legal protection.)
</P>
<P>
   Now, as long as selling plans are set up properly, the window
``becomes irrelevant and people ought to be able to sell on a
regular basis throughout the year,'' Furbush said.
</P>
<P>
   But it is not just senior managers who stand to benefit from the
new rule, which takes effect on Oct. 23. In the more relaxed
atmosphere of many high-technology companies, it sometimes seems
that practically everybody working at them knows what research
breakthroughs or corporate deals are in the works.
</P>
<P>
   Pia Chon, director of product marketing at RadView Software in
Burlington, Mass., said that virtually all employees ``are privy to
future technology, future acquisitions and revenue'' and other
important company information. The company has an insider trading
policy for all employees, she noted.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   As more and more lower-level people own stock in their
companies, they, too, are subject to insider-trading rules. To
escape any suspicion, experts said, they too might want to consider
setting up an SEC-approved selling plan.
</P>
<P>
   Selling plans that meet the new SEC specifications could also
have the effect of reassuring shareholders, analysts say.
Currently, the publicly announced sale of a large stake by a senior
executive is often viewed as a management bailout, whatever the
real motive, they say, while a pattern of selling according to a
prearranged formula would be more likely to be viewed as a
diversification strategy.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   The trading plans being authorized by the SEC hold another
potential benefit: ridding the market of any doubt about whether an
executive who sells his company's stock knows more than he is
letting on about his company's prospects. No matter how honest
senior executives are, said Bob Gabele, director of insider
research at First Call/Thomson Financial, they certainly have a
keener understanding than the public of their companies' general
outlook. And, he believes, illegal trading in which insiders have
more specific inside information about an important company
development is not all that uncommon.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are a large number of insider actions that cross the
line, and I'm not surprised when I see them,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   There is a loophole in the new rule for those who set up plans
and then watch in horror as their company's stock price tanks, but
it comes at a price. They can cancel a trade without breaking the
law, said John C. Coffee, a professor and securities law expert at
Columbia, but they would then be unable to hide behind their
trading plan in the future.
</P>
<P>
   The new rule has elicited little controversy, though some
securities lawyers have complained that it is vague and exceeds the
SEC's authority. Others believe the rule will help the SEC fortify
its enforcement powers while giving insiders some guidance on how
to comply with the law.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Some have long argued that untrammeled insider trading would
more quickly lead to stock prices that accurately reflect
companies' intrinsic value.
</P>
<P>
   Others, including the SEC, have long contended that lax insider
restrictions would create an unfair playing field that would damage
the integrity of the public markets.
</P>
<P>
   But over the last few years, the SEC. has been losing legal
ground in court battles against illegal insider trading. The new
rule is a response of sorts.
</P>
<P>
   ``They are essentially adopting this rule to reverse a couple of
court of appeals decisions,'' Coffee said. ``I think it's going to
place us back to where we were three or four years ago, while
providing insiders the ability to sell more.'' &QL;

<P>
   Sometimes _ recent days offering splendid examples _ one can't
help but conclude politics might better have been named (ITAL)
contradictions. (UNITAL)
</P>
<P>
   A poll released Monday is a fine demonstration. We are told
people ages 18 to 24 have strong opinions about the presidential
election, but less than half intend to vote. We get our first clue
right off the bat when it is reported only half of the 800 young
adults surveyed said they were registered to vote, and a mere 46
percent said they would vote.
</P>
<P>
   Here we are in the middle of a presidential political race so
close not even the professional pundits can stick with which major
party candidate they expect to win. Young Americans, however,
supposedly have strong opinions about the election; it's just that
only half of them are even registered to vote and not even that
many say they will vote.
</P>
<P>
   What's even goofier is the list of five reasons a published
account gives for their not planning to vote. Those reasons are: a
lack of information on the candidates; a belief that more can be
accomplished by community action than by voting; a sense that
politics is too driven by money and lies; a sense the country is
moving in the ``right direction''; and the sense of having little
in common with a major political party.
</P>
<P>
   Good grief. These have to be about the most unreasonable bunch
of reasons ever cited. Furthermore, they are a terrific display of
ignorance _ not just political ignorance, but pure ignorance.
Besides being dumb on individual face value, they also contradict
one another. Young folk believe the country is moving in the
``right direction,'' but they have no use for the politics and
politicians who certainly helped get it moving that way.
</P>
<P>
   As for there being a lack of information on the candidates, not
even those who love and thrive on hating the (ITAL) big (UNITAL)
media suggest it's not easy to get a lot of information on the
candidates. How else could they conceivably justify their myriad
complaints about what they maintain is incorrect information
constantly presented in the mainstream press?
</P>
<P>
   While this may not be super big in the school of contradictions,
it surely, correctly can be considered rather contradictory. Even
the most ideological of publications agree with the reports in the
so-called big media a whole lot of the time.
</P>
<P>
   If going from screaming bloody murder to not saying anything
counts as a contradiction, then, boy, do we have one on the topic
of presidential debates.
</P>
<P>
   When Republican George W. Bush dared, just had the unmitigated
gall, to suggest holding a couple of the three presidential debates
in formats that tended to restrict their airing to one major
regularly broadcast network for one and to a cable network for the
other, oh, my gosh, you'd have thought he was proposing to steal
from the handicapped.
</P>
<P>
   Oh, no. How awful, screamed the camp of Democrat Al Gore and a
great chunk of the political press and opinion writers.
</P>
<P>
   Gosh, it was declared, these debates must be broadcast on all
four major networks so we can be sure a lot of people will watch
them. It would be wrong, we were told, not to have them on all the
big networks _ else there could, and likely would, be entertaining
competition for the attention of sluggards who didn't really want
to watch any debates.
</P>
<P>
   OK, Bush and his camp got the formats he generally wanted and
Gore and his campaign and a lot of the press won by ensuring all
the debates will be available to ABC, CBS, NBC and Fox.
</P>
<P>
   Oops, little problem here. NBC says it won't carry next week's
debate because it'll be broadcasting a baseball game, and Fox says
it'll only air that debate on its cable network because it wants to
screen a two-hour premiere of a science-fiction adventure series,
made by the same guy who made the movie ``Titanic,'' on its regular
network.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe all those who saw the original contradiction have been
stone-quiet about NBC and Fox's no-debate decisions because they've
learned CBS will provide all the debates in Spanish for those who
have SAP. That, by the way, is Second Audio Program.
</P>
<P>
   Or, maybe, it's just that the last ones to see a contradiction
are those whose screaming caused it.
</P>
<P>
   In which case, maybe instead of concluding (ITAL) politics
(UNITAL) well might have been called (ITAL) contradictions,
(UNITAL) one might more correctly decide the better conclusion
might be (ITAL) contradictions, (UNITAL) should have been named
(ITAL) politics (UNITAL). &QL;

   VIOLENCE-HOLLYWOOD (Los Angeles) -- In preparation for
Wednesday's congressional hearing on whether Hollywood is marketing
violence to youngsters, studios have agreed to several steps, MPAA
head Jack Valentia announced Tuesday, such as omitting previews for
R-rated films in videos of G-rated movies, and asking theater
owners not to show previews for R-rated films during G-rated
movies. But the plan, which does not mention TV ads, was blasted by
critics who call it insufficient. G-rated films are less than 5
percent of all releases rated by the MPAA. By Bill Hillburg. (Will

   PALO ALTO, Calif. _ Education reformers of conservative or
libertarian stripe are already hanging crepe for the school voucher
initiative on the California ballot next month. It will be a major
blow to their movement nationally if voters in the most populous
state reject, for the second time in less than 10 years, the idea
of giving public money to parents to help students escape public
schools.
</P>
<P>
   Vouchers are an intellectually interesting but largely untested
article of faith for many in the camp that correctly diagnoses the
poor state of public education but then often fixates on teachers
unions, vehement opponents of vouchers, as the taproot of a problem
that has far more diverse causes.
</P>
<P>
   The California initiative, Proposition 38, would give parents
$4,000 for every school-age child that could be spent for any form
of currently sanctioned education _ including parochial, secular
private, charter school, home schooling. It's the brainchild of
high-tech venture capitalist Tim Draper, a guy with more money than
political skill.
</P>
<P>
   Draper unwisely rejected pleas of some voucher supporters to
target the proposal for the poor or on demonstrably wretched
schools (which are virtually one and the same thing). He also did
not seek to insulate the measure from criticism that helped doom a
similar California initiative in 1993, especially a lack of rules
to guarantee equity and access in private education.
</P>
<P>
   Draper has pledged to spend up to $20 million on the campaign.
And with the issue tanking, he has offered Hawaiian vacations,
computers and shopping sprees to folks who'll sign up supporters.
But it seems a lost cause, Stanford political scientist _ and
voucher supporter _ Terry Moe told a Hoover Institution seminar
staffed by what the professor called ``a small band of
nonconformists.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Who is supporting this? No one,'' Moe said. ``It's a bump
along the road that didn't have to be there.''
</P>
<P>
   The most recent statewide survey of the Public Policy Institute
of California showed more than a majority of likely voters already
oppose Prop. 38 _ a near-fatal standing for a ballot initiative a
month before an election. The PPIC analysis is that the measure
``faces an uphill battle in large part because it is not viewed as
a solution to improving schools or student performance.''
</P>
<P>
   A similar fate may await a voucher initiative next month in
Michigan, where even Republican Gov. John Engler opposes the
proposal, which at heart is a repeal of the state's constitutional
ban on public aid to private schools. The Michigan plan would
provide just over $3,000 of state money per child in districts that
graduate less than two-thirds of their students _ a formula that
would include the giant (and egregiously problem-ridden) Detroit
system and about 30 others statewide.
</P>
<P>
   Among the initiative's biggest backers is the self-interested
Roman Catholic Church, operator of the state's largest private
school system. Model sermons are being drafted for pre-election
exhortations.
</P>
<P>
   The National Education Association, the nation's largest
teachers union, is, as usual, playing tough. At its national
convention in July, the NEA instituted a &QL; 
$5-a-member assessment to fight voucher programs, $3 of which (or
some $6 million) is earmarked for the ``no'' campaigns in
California and Michigan.
</P>
<P>
   Only about 50,000 students are in voucher programs, meaning
suggestions of success are anecdotal at best and provide far too
sketchy findings on which to base wholesale changes in the nation's
education system, even as troubled as it admittedly is.
</P>
<P>
   Given vouchers' political baggage and the prospect of
approaching bad luck at the polls, it seems that incremental
advances with smaller, experimental programs, for vouchers as well
as other proposals, would be a better way to go. But that
suggestion from the Hoover audience drew what seemed to be an
unappreciative sneer from some of the crusading ``nonconformists.''
</P>
<P>
   Chester Finn, a Vanderbilt professor and Manhattan Institute
fellow who was a Reagan administration Education Department
official, said that reaching for something bold and extreme
sometimes allows the merely interesting to bubble up. That could be
a desirable cause and effect, but there is little evidence that
it's actually occurring.

BUSH CAMP CALLS FOR FBI PROBE OF TAPE THEFT 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By ANNE E. KORNBLUT  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   REDWOOD CITY, Calif. _ The Bush campaign, clearly rattled by
questions about how a mock debate videotape ended up in the
possession of Al Gore, Tuesday demanded the FBI investigate the
vice president's campaign to determine who infiltrated their
operation and obtained the tape.
</P>
<P>
   George W. Bush has avoided mentioning the matter so as not to
distract voters from his daily message. But the mysterious mailing,
arguably the strangest event of the campaign, had by Tuesday
evolved into a political issue, as Bush communications director
Karen Hughes all but accused the FBI of failing to fully
investigate Gore.
</P>
<P>
   ``Any thorough investigation into how Bush campaign proprietary
materials ended up in the hands of the Gore campaign involves not
only the Bush campaign but also the Gore campaign,'' Hughes said.
``The Gore campaign has obviously had a problem, because they have
had to suspend one of their employees for boasting about the
presence of a mole. We think that is something that is very serious
and that ought to be looked at.''
</P>
<P>
   The tape, mailed anonymously but with an Austin postmark, was
sent along with a debate briefing book to former New York
Representative Tom Downey earlier this month. Downey, a Democrat
who was playing the role of Bush in mock debates with Gore, said he
viewed only 60 to 90 seconds of the tape before realizing it was
highly confidential and turning it off. He then turned it over to
the FBI.
</P>
<P>
   Since then, both sides have speculated wildly _ but not publicly
_ about who might be responsible, with each campaign insisting it
is not involved. Last weekend, the Gore campaign suspended a junior
staff-member, Michael Doyne, 28, for admitting he joked in an
e-mail to a friend about a well-placed Bush ``mole'' _ a turn of
events the Bush campaign quickly seized upon.
</P>
<P>
   But the matter has now become more than a whodunnit. Despite
concerns about letting the issue become a distraction, the Bush
campaign Tuesday nudged it into the political spotlight, implying
the FBI is not doing enough to resolve the matter and is perhaps
even showing some favoritism to Gore.
</P>
<P>
   Bush officials were especially piqued that, as of Tuesday
morning, they had not received a return phone call from FBI
Director Louis Freeh, despite at least two phone calls from Bush
campaign manager Joe Allbaugh over the last three days. Hughes said
a lower-level employee returned the call, ``but our campaign
manager conveyed to him that he did not feel that was satisfactory,
and he would like to talk to the director.''
</P>
<P>
   Justice Department officials and FBI investigators also opened
themselves up to charges of political maneuvering last weekend,
Hughes said, when news that FBI officials suspected a traitor
within the Bush campaign was anonymously leaked.
</P>
<P>
   The FBI gave ``the appearance, at least, of playing politics in
the midst of a presidential campaign,'' Hughes said, calling even
such appearances ``wrong and inappropriate.''
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, the Bush campaign dismissed accusations from
the head of the Texas Democratic Party that a senior Bush
strategist, Karl Rove, was somehow involved.
</P>
<P>
   Molly Beth Malcolm, the leading Democrat in Bush's home state,
was quoted in Tuesday's edition of the Austin American-Statesman as
saying the mystery had ``Karl Rove's fingerprints all over it.''
Hughes dismissed the charge as ``totally ridiculous,'' urging
reporters to ``consider the source.'' Rove, a legendary figure in
Texas politics with a reputation for devilish tactics, did not
return a call for comment.
</P>
<P>
   The Gore campaign refused to address any of the issues raised by
the Bush aides. Douglas Hattaway, a Gore spokesman, simply said:
``This matter is in the hands of professional investigators at the
FBI. We are comfortable with that. For some reason, the Bush
campaign apparently is not.''
</P>
<P>
   Hughes vehemently denied any high-ranking staff member was
involved, and said aides would be willing to take a lie-detector
test to prove it.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know the people who have access to the tape. They are my
friends, they are my co-workers, they have worked with me for
years,'' she said. ``It's so ridiculous, I don't think it merits a
denial. What you are talking about here are people who have worked
tirelessly for years to elect Governor Bush president. We are not
interested in helping Al Gore in his debate preparations.''

   KODAK-EARNINGS (Undated) _ The Eastman Kodak Co., citing a
sudden and as-yet-unexplained sales decline in every one of its
businesses, warned investors Tuesday that its third-quarter
earnings would be as much as 25 cents below expectations, and that,
if sales do not pick up, fourth quarter earnings might disappoint
as well. No one seems certain if the drop is a one-time blip or a
sign of long-term woes, but investors clearly expect the worst. By

US SUES HARVARD, 4 INDIVIDUALS IN RESEARCH FUNDING CASE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By PATRICK HEALY  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ The U.S. Justice Department sued Harvard University and
four individuals Tuesday for up to $120 million for allegedly
mismanaging and defrauding a government-funded project to help
overhaul the Russian economy.
</P>
<P>
   The civil lawsuit, filed in U.S. District Court, charges that
Harvard and its two project managers billed the government for $40
million in work that was biased by insider dealings and investments
of the managers and their wives.
</P>
<P>
   Named in the suit were Andrei Shleifer, a well-known Harvard
economics professor, and his second-in-command, Jonathan Hay, a
legal expert and graduate of Harvard Law School. The lawsuit
alleges that the two ``abused their positions as high-level and
trusted advisers to and on behalf of the United States in Russia.''
</P>
<P>
   Harvard's $57 million Russia project, which ran from 1992 to
1997, was one of the U.S.'s top foreign-aid programs to westernize
the former Soviet financial system. The university was responsible
for giving impartial advice to Russian officials and policing
conflicts of interest among the Harvard advisers helping to
privatize state-controlled assets.
</P>
<P>
   But, according to the civil suit, Shleifer and his wife, Nancy
Zimmerman, invested $200,000 in gas and utility companies, such as
Gazprom, that were influenced by the plans he was helping to shape.
</P>
<P>
   Shleifer and Hay allegedly also used their employees to research
Russian oil stocks, and soon after bought hundreds of thousands of
dollars' worth, in a relative's name.
</P>
<P>
   ``The advice and services, even if of value and assistance to
Russia, were still fundamentally tainted by the financial self
dealing,'' said U.S. Attorney Donald K. Stern at a news conference.
``For its part, Harvard failed miserably in its obligations to
adminster this overseas project.''
</P>
<P>
   Harvard officials denied responsibility for the alleged abuses.
Calling the privatization effort ``first rate,'' they said they met
all of their obligations to the U.S. Agency for International
Development, which funded the project.
</P>
<P>
   If improper conduct did occur, university officials added, the
blame lay with the managers.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're a stand-up institution that takes our ethical standards
and contractual obligations very seriously,'' said Anne Taylor, the
university's general counsel. ``We know virtually nothing about
this alleged private conduct.''
</P>
<P>
   Taylor said the university wants to review the government's
evidence, and then may consider settlement talks. An earlier round,
before the suit was filed, did not reach a resolution.
</P>
<P>
   Lawyers for the project managers also denied wrongdoing.
</P>
<P>
   Hay _ who was fired by Harvard in 1997 after an initial federal
inquiry found problems with the project _ was accused of investing
in the oil stocks and, with Elizabeth Hebert, his then-girlfriend
whom he later married, creating a real estate firm to conduct
business that touched on his work with the project.
</P>
<P>
   Professor Shleifer, meanwhile, was accused of making the
oil-stock purchases with Hay, as well as investing money with his
wife in Russian companies.
</P>
<P>
   But Shleifer's attorney, Earl Nemser, said his client was not
bound by the project's ban on investments and conflict of interest
because Shleifer was technically a consultant to the project, not
an employee. Nemser said Shleifer always remained an employee of
Harvard, even during a year when he was on a leave of absence to
lead the project.
</P>
<P>
   ``As a consultant, there were no restrictions,'' Nemser said.
</P>
<P>
   The Russia project was once a jewel in Harvard's
international-development efforts, which offer high-profile and
lucrative opportunities to faculty stars there. Several Harvard
professors continue to lead projects, some government related, to
help modernize or reform national economies.
</P>
<P>
   Shleifer served as principal investigator and project manager on
the Russia project, which was funded in 1992 and again in 1995
under two cooperative agreements between Harvard and USAID. Such
pacts typically assign responsibilities to all partners, unlike
pay-for-service contracts, where the grant recipient is accountable
for meeting the terms of the agreement.
</P>
<P>
   USAID was not a target of the government's action. Rather, the
agency initially blew the whistle on the Russia project, finding in
an audit that the two managers had ``gained influence'' over
Russian financial markets and had ``abused the trust of the United
States government.''
</P>
<P>
   USAID cut off funding in 1997, after Harvard had removed
Shleifer and Hay from the project, university officials said.
</P>
<P>
   But Harvard officials said that under the cooperative agreement,
USAID had as much of a role to play in overseeing the project as
the university. They noted that USAID had a Moscow office but was
not aware of misconduct within the project.
</P>
<P>
   Taylor also pointed out an acknowledgement by the U.S.
Attorney's Office that Shleifer and Hay were allegedly trying to
cover up their investments.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think a reasonable person would understand that it would be
very, very difficult to catch this kind of private conduct,''
Taylor said.
</P>
<P>
   But Stern emphasized that Harvard was the chief guarantor of the
integrity of the project, and not USAID. Even if the managers'
advice to the Russians was sound, he said, the endeavor was
compromised. The lawsuit, he added, reflected heightened government
scrutiny of grant management by universities and other recipients.
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. Attorney's Office began both civil and criminal probes
of the project three years ago. No criminal charges have been
filed, and Stern said that the evidence at this point might not
meet the standard of proof needed for criminal convictions.
</P>
<P>
   The suit is based on the federal False Claims Act, which
increases penalties on those found defrauding the U.S. government.
Under the law, damages are tripled if fraud is proven. If the
government wins this case, the $40 million in alleged false claims
would grow to $120 million in damages.
</P>
<P>
   Asked whether Harvard was named because of its deep pockets _
which grew even deeper Friday, with the announcement that its
endowment stood at $19 billion _ Stern demurred, just barely.
</P>
<P>
   ``We do think Harvard will be good for the judgment,'' he said.

LAWYERS ARGUE REOPENING OF LEWIS SUIT APPEAL 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By SACHA PFEIFFER  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ Saying that his client has been put through ``absolute
torture both personally and professionally,'' a lawyer for Dr.
Gilbert H. Mudge Jr. Tuesday asked a judge to reject Donna
Harris-Lewis's request that her appeal of a jury verdict clearing
Mudge of medical malpractice be reopened.
</P>
<P>
   ``It has to stop, your honor,'' said William J. Dailey Jr., the
attorney for Mudge, who was the chief cardiologist for Celtics
captain Reggie Lewis at the time of Lewis's 1993 death. ``It has
been an absolute nightmare what he has gone through.''
</P>
<P>
   Dailey's entreaty capped a 3 1/2-hour hearing at which
Harris-Lewis, represented by a new team of lawyers, maintained that
her former lawyer, Neil Rossman, failed to pursue her appeal and
never told her it was at risk of being dismissed.
</P>
<P>
   Superior Court Judge Thayer Fremont-Smith tossed out
Harris-Lewis's appeal in July after she missed a filing deadline
required to continue it.
</P>
<P>
   Taking the stand Tuesday, Rossman, who represented Harris-Lewis
in the retrial of the lawsuit she brought against Mudge, said he
searched for issues to appeal but found none. Rossman also said he
delayed filing appellate documents in order to give Harris-Lewis
time to find a new lawyer.
</P>
<P>
   And he produced letters he wrote to Harris-Lewis in which he
warned her that she was ``running out of time'' to pursue her
appeal and cautioned that ``you are wasting your money in
prosecuting any appeal.''
</P>
<P>
   But under questioning by one of Harris-Lewis's new lawyers,
Pamela Harris-Daley, Rossman conceded that he never gave
Harris-Lewis a specific deadline for continuing her appeal, even
though she had sent him a letter asking for that information.
</P>
<P>
   Harris-Daley argued that, as a result, Harris-Lewis did not know
the appeal was at risk of being dismissed and is entitled to have
the appeal reopened.
</P>
<P>
   Responding to Dailey's argument that Harris-Lewis effectively
waived her right to appeal when she missed a filling deadline,
Harris-Daley said that ``it is unreasonable and illogical to
suggest that one could knowingly and intelligently waive a right
that one doesn't understand.''
</P>
<P>
   Fremont-Smith took the matter under advisement.

 JUSTICES ACCEPT 4th AMENDMENT CASE ON USE OF HEAT DETECTION By LINDA GREENHOUSE   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ While the Supreme Court's decision not to hear the
Microsoft case grabbed the headlines, the justices were also busy
on another front Tuesday, adding a dozen new cases to their docket
for the new term that opens on Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Culled from the hundreds of appeals that accumulated over the
summer recess, the new cases present a wide range of issues, from
criminal law to immigration law, from questions of prison inmates'
free-speech rights to interpretations of federal civil rights,
labor and disability law.
</P>
<P>
   One new case, in particular, assured the new session's status as
an unusually important term for the Fourth Amendment law of search
and seizure, already the subject of three cases the justices had
previously scheduled for argument during the coming weeks. The new
case raises the question of whether the use by police of a thermal
imaging device to detect heat patterns inside a home is a search
that requires a warrant.
</P>
<P>
   Because high-intensity lights are often used for cultivating
marijuana plants indoors, thermal imagers, which translate heat
patterns into a visual design, are increasingly popular law
enforcement tools for detecting marijuana-growing operations.
Defendants often challenge the use of the device as an
unconstitutional search, and the lower courts have reached
conflicting results.
</P>
<P>
   In the case the justices accepted Tuesday, the federal appeals
court in San Francisco affirmed the conviction of an Oregon man for
growing marijuana in his home. A suggestive heat pattern was
detected by a device called an Agema Thermovision 210, enabling
police to then obtain a warrant to search Danny Lee Kyllo's house.
The house was not randomly chosen for surveillance; Kyllo's wife
had been arrested on a drug charge, and the police suspected that
the couple were part of a conspiracy to grow and distribute
marijuana in the area.
</P>
<P>
   Kyllo conditionally pleaded guilty while challenging the use of
the imager as an unconstitutional search. He initially won his case
before the 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals, but the appellate
court changed its mind after one judge retired and issued a new
opinion declaring that thermal imaging was not a search. The device
``intruded into nothing'' and did not violate any reasonable
expectation of privacy, the 1999 opinion said.
</P>
<P>
   In his Supreme Court appeal, Kyllo v. United States, No.
99-8508, Kyllo said that to the contrary, his case ``raises the
fundamental question of whether the Fourth Amendment's guarantee of
personal security in one's home must yield to scientific advances
that render our traditional barriers of privacy obsolete.'' He said
the appeals court's approach ``subjugates the security and privacy
of a citizen's home to advancing technological development.''
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   This is not the first time that the Supreme Court has been faced
with applying the Fourth Amendment's prohibition of unreasonable
searches in the context of technological development. In a landmark
1967 case, Katz v. United States, the court ruled that the
placement of an electronic listening device on the outside of a
telephone booth was a search, even though there was no physical
intrusion on private space. In a 1984 case, United States v. Karo,
the court ruled that the government's placement of a beeper inside
a can, to track the can's movements, was a search.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Opposing the court's review of Kyllo's case, the Justice
Department told the justices that the use of the imager ``did not
intrude on any expectation of privacy that society is prepared to
recognize as reasonable.'' The government's brief said the imager
revealed ``only amorphous hot spots, not intimate details'' of
activities within the house.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   The Kyllo case is the fourth significant Fourth Amendment case
the court has agreed to review during the new term. On Tuesday, the
justices will hear arguments in City of Indianapolis v. Edmond, No.
99-1030, on whether a drug-interdiction checkpoint on a city
street, during which a drug-detecting dog sniffs the stopped cars,
violates the Fourth Amendment.
</P>
<P>
   On Oct. 4, in Ferguson v. City of Charleston, No. 99-936, the
court will hear arguments on whether drug tests of the urine of
pregnant women who came to a municipal hospital for care, with
positive results to be turned over to the police, were
unconstitutional searches. And in December, in Atwater vs. City of
Lago Vista, Texas, No. 99-1408, the court will hear arguments on
whether a full-scale custodial arrest _ including handcuffs,
booking, and an hour in a jail cell _ for driving without a
seatbelt amounted to an unconstitutional seizure when the offense
carried a maximum penalty of $50 under Texas law.
</P>
<P>
   The 12 new cases the court accepted Tuesday brought the number
of granted cases to 47, filling the court's argument calendar into
early February. The justices will add more cases as the new term
proceeds.

</P>
<P>
   These were among the day's other highlights.
</P>
<P>
   Discrimination Suits
</P>
<P>
   In a potentially important civil rights case, the court agreed
to decide whether individuals can sue state agencies for
administering federal grants in a manner that has the effect of
discriminating on the basis of race or national origin.
</P>
<P>
   The case is an appeal by the state of Alabama, where a
requirement that drivers' license tests be administered only in
English was successfully challenged in a class-action lawsuit on
the ground that the requirement had a discriminatory impact on
foreign-born drivers. The case was brought under Title VI of the
Civil Rights Act of 1964, which bars discrimination in programs
that receive federal money _ as all state motor vehicle departments
do.
</P>
<P>
   While it is clear that Title VI bars intentional discrimination,
the law is unsettled on whether Congress intended to authorize
private lawsuits against agencies for policies that have a
discriminatory impact, regardless of intent.
</P>
<P>
   This seemingly arcane distinction between intent and effect is
important in discrimination law, because the court has interpreted
the Constitution's equal protection guarantee as prohibiting only
intentional discrimination. The extent to which Congress can define
rights more expansively than the Constitution itself is a focus of
increasing scrutiny by the court. This case, Alexander v. Sandoval,
No. 99-1908, is an appeal from a ruling by the 11th U.S. Circuit
Court of Appeals, in Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
   Citizenship Rights
</P>
<P>
   The court agreed to decide whether a distinction in federal
immigration law between out-of-wedlock children born overseas to
American mothers and those born to American fathers amounts to
unconstitutional sex discrimination. Under the law, those whose
unmarried mothers are U.S. citizens are deemed themselves to be
U.S. citizens at birth, a privilege denied those whose mothers are
foreign nationals and whose fathers are the U.S. citizens. The
American father must act to formally acknowledge paternity before
the child is 18.
</P>
<P>
   Two years ago, the court split deeply in a case that raised this
issue and failed to resolve it, although five justices indicated
their belief that the law was unconstitutional. The latest case,
Nguyen v. INS, No. 99-2071, was brought by a Vietnamese-born son
and the American father who raised him. Deemed a noncitizen, the
son is facing deportation to Vietnam following conviction on an
assault charge. The father did not make a formal declaration before
the son, now 31, turned 18, and the Board of Immigration Appeals
refused to consider DNA evidence that proves paternity. The 5th
U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals, in New Orleans, upheld the law,
which the father and son are challenging as embodying ``sex
stereotypes relating to men's and women's parenting roles.''

<P>
   NEW YORK _ Boxing has always provided an apt metaphor for films
about struggle and redemption. The troubled young man from the poor
background is locked in the frame with his adversary, the sweat
flies, there are close-ups of agonized faces and the architecture
of oiled and muscled bodies. As more and more women, including
Muhammad Ali's daughter, Laila, and Joe Frazier's daughter, Jacqui
Frazier-Lyde, take up the sport, it is almost inevitable that films
about women who box should follow, too.
</P>
<P>
   Now comes ``Girlfight,'' a first feature by Karyn Kusama, which
opened Friday. It is the story of a sullen, gum chewing, muscular
girl from the underclass, played by Michelle Rodriguez, who
literally fights her way into the ring.
</P>
<P>
   ``The idea was to take the classic boxing story, put a female
protagonist in it and subvert the form,'' said Kusama, 32.
</P>
<P>
   Like more traditional boxing movies before it _ ``The Champ,''
with Wallace Beery, ``Champion,'' with Kirk Douglas, or `Raging
Bull'' and ``Rocky'' _ ``Girlfight'' is about ``an outsider who
enters a world where she does not belong and finds a place for
herself,'' Kusama said. In fact, that description could apply to
Kusama: she had to struggle to get financing for the film from
reluctant studios.
</P>
<P>
   Movie companies wanted her to make her character a white girl,
``a celebrity starlet in an environment of material comfort,'' said
Kusama, who described trying to raise money for the film as ``a
nightmare.''
</P>
<P>
   ``A woman in a traditional male role is really scary for
people,'' she said. ``People felt she would be unappealing,
unbelievable.''
</P>
<P>
   Kusama added: ``I wasn't thinking of the movie in sociopolitical
terms. I thought it would be fresh.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Girlfight,'' which shared the Grand Jury Prize at the Sundance
Film Festival with ``You Can Count on Me'' and which also won the
Director's Award, provides a rare film portrait of the lives of
Panamanians and Dominicans, as well as Puerto Ricans, who inhabit
the world of boxing. ``It's modern, urban Latino,'' said Kusama.
Most movies about Latinos feature primarily Puerto Ricans, Kusama
said, but Latino ``doesn't mean one thing.''
</P>
<P>
   In ``Girlfight,'' the protagonist, Diana _ hair slicked down in
corn rows, with a strand falling over her eyes _ is prone to
starting fights in high school. There are sorrows buried in Diana's
family, including a mother who had committed suicide after being
physically abused by Diana's father (played by Paul Calderon).
Meanwhile, the father has pinned his hopes on her brother (Ray
Santiago), whom he wants to be a boxer but who really wants to be
an artist.
</P>
<P>
   When Diana goes to the neighborhood gym in search of her
brother, she decides she wants to box, too. But the trainer tells
her: ``You can't. Girls don't have the same power as boys.'' She
asks her father to pay for her training, but he won't hear of it.
So she steals from him and pawns her mother's locket. Soon she
meets another young fighter, Adrian (Santiago Douglas), and they
fall in love. When Diana takes a punch in the eye, she asks Adrian,
``Do you still like me with my black eye?''
</P>
<P>
   ``I think I like you more,'' Adrian replies.
</P>
<P>
   At first, when the lovers spar, Adrian can't bear to hit her.
``I love you, I really do,'' she tells him as they are locked in
combat.
</P>
<P>
   ``They say love kills you in the ring,'' one of the boxers says.
</P>
<P>
   Then, in what the gym owner bills as New York's ``first
gender-blind amateur boxing event,'' Diana and Adrian are paired
against each other. But Adrian is reluctant. ``If you don't fight
me in this match,'' Diana says, ``you're less of a man than you
think you are.''
</P>
<P>
   Kusama admits that the idea of women and men fighting each other
in boxing competition is unlikely at the moment. But ``10 year ago
boys and girls wouldn't wrestle each other,'' she said. ``Now they
do it in high school and college championships. And the girls
sometimes win.''
</P>
<P>
   Kusama was drawn to boxing in 1992, when a friend took her to
Gleason's Gym in Brooklyn. A chain smoker, she hoped sparring would
curb her habit. She came to love the sport. ``I realized what an
intimate situation it is.'' It was as if the two people in the ring
had invaded each other's sense of space and time, she said. ``It
made sense to me that young boys from very, very troubled
backgrounds would seek out the physical contact and the emotional
contact with the trainers.''
</P>
<P>
   Of course, you can really get hurt. On one occasion, Kusama was
knocked out by ``a really good woman boxer,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can wear a breast plate, but it's not very effective to
punch someone on the breast. It makes more sense to go for the
organs or the brain, the liver, the kidneys.''
</P>
<P>
   For Kusama, ``There's a sort of decorum to the violence of
boxing that I took to be an idealized version of the world.'' Only,
she added, ``where in life do you have a referee?''
</P>
<P>
   ``Boxers are the most courageous people in the world, oh my
God,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   The story for ``Girlfight'' grew partly out her own ``general
sense of isolation and alienation growing up,'' Kusama said.
</P>
<P>
   She was raised in St. Louis, where her father, a
Japanese-American, is a child psychiatrist and her mother an
educational psychologist. Kusama attended New York University Film
school and won the Mobil Prize for ``Sleeping Beauties,'' a 15-
minute short about two sisters with a telepathic connection.
</P>
<P>
   After graduating from NYU, Kusama became, she said, ``the queen
of odd jobs,'' adding, ``I've tried to just get through life.'' She
met the filmmaker John Sayles through a baby-sitting job and became
his personal assistant. She was impressed by Sayles's commitment to
his art. She watched him develop his 1996 movie ``Lone Star'' from
inception to release.
</P>
<P>
   When Kusama wrote the script for ``Girlfight,'' Sayles's
longtime companion, Maggie Renzi, and her business partner Sarah
Greene, agreed to produce it, along with Martha Griffin. The budget
was $1 million. But all the film companies, including Sony Classics
Pictures, Fine Line Features, Miramax, passed.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, in 1999, Kusama secured a backer. But two days before
pre-production began, the backer pulled out. Sayles came to the
rescue with a check for $1 million. Later, the Independent Film
Channel chipped in $300,000, which went to Sayles to offset his
investment.
</P>
<P>
   Sayles said he had never doubted that the film would get a
distributor. He liked the idea of a woman as the main character in
a boxing movie. ``She doesn't want to be a `girly-girl,''' he said
on the phone recently. ``She's in chaos. Once in that world, there
is a kind of belonging.'' (MORE)
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
   Kusama found her star, Rodriguez, at an open casting call. A
self-described ``Jersey City girl'' who is half Dominican and half
Puerto Rican, she grew up in a rough neighborhood. Members of her
family are Jehovah's Witnesses. She dropped out of high school and
later got her high school equivalency diploma at age 17. ``Life
educated me, honey,'' Rodriguez said in a phone interview.
</P>
<P>
   Rodriguez had decided to pursue acting because she hated the
idea of a 9-to-5 job. She then signed up with ``some cheesy agency
that, like, robs you for money,'' she said. The agency took photos
of her but failed to get her a job. Then she saw the notice for the
``Girlfight'' call in Backstage. ``I got there about one and a half
hours late, as always,'' she said. ``I'm pretty irresponsible.''
</P>
<P>
   There were 350 other contenders for the part. ``She read
lines,'' said Kusama. ``It was a disaster. She had no concept of
what this process was. She didn't know that when you make a mistake
you don't berate yourself in the middle of the tape and roll your
eyes.''
</P>
<P>
   But ``we could not find anyone who could come close to her in
physical power,'' Kusama said. ``Michelle projects a lot of
intelligence, more like an animal intelligence.'' The director
decided to take a chance.
</P>
<P>
   The production hired an acting coach, and sent Rodriguez, who
had never boxed before, to a gym to get in shape. ``After a week
they said I was ready to spar,'' Rodriguez said. ``I turned into an
animal.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I looked like I was on steroids because I was so buff.''
</P>
<P>
   The film was shot in Jersey City and New York. It was accepted
at the Sundance competition, and suddenly all the companies that
had rejected it began competing to buy it, Kusama said. Finally,
Screen Gems purchased it for $3 million. Kusama also made a deal
with Capitol Records to release the distinctive soundtrack with its
blend of hip-hop, flamenco and hand clapping.
</P>
<P>
   Kusama herself has given up boxing. She lives in the Fort Greene
section of Brooklyn with three roommates and is writing a new
script, which she describes as ``bio-fiction.'' She doesn't have a
production deal, but, with the release of ``Girlfight,'' she said,
she believes it will be far easier to get money for a movie this
time around.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now,''she said, ``I will be playing a different kind of
game.''

   YUGO-ELECTIONS (Belgrade, Yugoslavia) _ The
government-controlled Federal Election Commission announced on
Tuesday night that President Slobodan Milosevic had won enough
votes to force a second-round runoff for the presidency on Oct. 8
against challenger Vojislav Kostunica, challenging Kostunica's
claim of an outright victory in the first round of voting on
Sunday. Opposition leaders immediately called the commission
figures fraudulent and said they would insist that Kostunica had
won without the need for a runoff. By Steven Erlanger.

Freeh defended their actions Tuesday, asserting that Lee had
committed a serious crime when he removed atomic weapons data from
a classified computer system at Los Alamos lab. At the hearing on
Tuesday, a joint session of the Senate Judiciary and Intelligence
committees, none of the senators disputed the seriousness of the
information that Lee was accused of placing at risk. But several
assailed the Justice Department and the FBI for lapses in the
investigation and for their insistence on keeping Lee in solitary

<P>
   Q: How bad is it to rely on those pre-packed lunch meals with
mini pizzas, tacos, etc?
</P>
<P>
   A: It's no surprise that many of the pre-packed lunches are
relatively high in fat and sodium compared to something like a
turkey sandwich. But it's not necessarily any worse if the
alternative would have been a sandwich of high-fat lunch meat or
``junk'' food. This is especially true for children and teens,
whose calorie needs are high enough to allow room for some high-fat
foods. Just be sure other meals and snacks are relatively lean.
</P>
<P>
   The biggest problem may be what goes with the lunch: Where are
the vegetables and fruits so vital for good health? A meal finished
off with sugar-laden desserts or beverages-like the so-called
``juice drinks'' containing little or no juice-leaves a lot to be
desired. And that's true for meals that are pre-packaged or made at
home.
</P>
<P>
   If you prefer pre-packed lunches, look for those without the
less nutritious fillers and add your own fruit, raw vegetables and
whole-grain bread. But you might question whether it's worth paying
more for a nutritionally incomplete, pre-packaged meal that you
must then supplement.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Is couscous a whole grain?
</P>
<P>
   A: Couscous may look like a whole grain such as bulgur or brown
rice, but it is really just another form of pasta. Couscous is
commercially prepared by mixing coarsely ground semolina with water
and salt to form a dough that is rolled into tiny balls and dried.
A fast and delicious addition to a meal, couscous is steam-cooked
until fluffy. Most couscous is made of an enriched refined grain, a
good source of complex carbohydrates and vitamins, but not quite as
nutritious as a whole grain. Whole grains generally contain more
fiber than enriched grain products, as well as several vitamins,
minerals and natural phytochemicals. A few companies offer whole
wheat couscous.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Is it true that rye bread is healthier than wheat bread?
</P>
<P>
   A: You probably heard about a study published in the Journal of
Nutrition that reported that people who ate rye bread lowered their
blood cholesterol. However, there's more to this story. The study
was conducted in Finland, where rye bread is a dark, whole-grain
version not commonly seen in this country. American rye bread is
usually a refined grain product that is not nearly as high in
fiber. In the Finnish study, men who ate large amounts of this
whole-grain rye bread (about 20 percent of their daily calories),
dropped their LDL (''bad'') cholesterol about 12 percent in four
weeks. For some reason, however, the same diet did not affect the
blood cholesterol of women in the study.
</P>
<P>
   What we can infer from this and several other studies is that
whole grains_ whether rye, wheat or other grains_ are linked with a
variety of health benefits. People who eat more whole grains have a
lower risk of heart disease.
</P>
<P>
   These Ask a Dietitian questions were answered by Karen Collins,
M.S., R.D. of the American Institute for Cancer Research.

   TO TAX OR NOT TO TAX: California Gov. Gray Davis vetoed a bill
that would have forced the state's retailers to collect sales tax
on Internet transactions. Davis also signed a bill calling for a
three-year moratorium on Internet access taxes. The push in Georgia
to tax e-commerce sales, however, continues. This year the Georgia
Senate and House passed resolutions asking Congress to allow states
to tax Internet sales. Legislators believe Net sales are a
substitute for bricks-and-mortar sales and that sales tax receipts
will fall as e-commerce increases. They also say omitting
e-commerce taxes is ``unfair'' to other merchants. Opponents,
however, argue that e-commerce retailers and their employees
already pay property, income and other state and local taxes where
they are based. Critics also say taxing Internet transactions will
hurt efforts to attract high-tech industry to the state.

<P>
   VOICE WEB ACCESS: Intel Corp. says it will eventually sell
technology that allows companies to offer consumers voice access to

Intel made the announcement at the Networld +Interop show in

merchants. The goal is to improve security on the Web to attract
more consumers and reduce costs associated with fraud. Merchants

<P>
   WASHINGTON _ As executives of movie studios prepared to testify
at a Senate hearing on Wednesday, industry officials announced
steps Tuesday to limit the marketing of adult-rated movies to
children.
</P>
<P>
   Jack Valenti, president of the Motion Picture Association of
America, said at a news conference that major movie-making
companies had established a ``goal of not inappropriately
specifically targeting children in its advertising of films rated R
for violence.''
</P>
<P>
   He said the film makers had agreed not to include children under
17 in focus groups used to test movies rated R because of violence
unless the children were accompanied by a parent or guardian. And
he said previews for such movies would no longer be shown before
G-rated movies in theaters.
</P>
<P>
   The new steps are voluntary and include no enforcement
mechanism. Valenti said the association each year would review
compliance.
</P>
<P>
   Under the guidelines, children under 17 are not supposed to be
allowed in R-rated movies unless they are with an adult. Movies
rated G are supposed to be suitable for children. There are two
ratings in between, PG (warning parents that some material may not
be suitable for children) and PG-13 (warning that some material may
be inappropriate for children under 13).
</P>
<P>
   Valenti said the industry was responding to criticism from a
report by the Federal Trade Commission, released Sept. 11, that
most adult-rated movies, recordings and electronic games were
marketed to children.
</P>
<P>
   Two days later, executives of companies that make and sell
recordings and video games testified before the Senate commerce
committee and were sharply criticized by senators. Representatives
of companies that make movies had refused to appear on such short
notice, so the panel's chairman, Sen. John McCain, R-Ariz., called
a new hearing and summoned the movie executives.
</P>
<P>
   Valenti said executives from the eight largest studios would
testify. They are the Walt Disney Co., DreamWorks SKG,
Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer Studios, Paramount Pictures, Sony Pictures
Entertainment, 20th Century Fox Film Corp., Universal Studios and
Warner Bros.
</P>
<P>
   He suggested that some of them would announce efforts to limit
marketing that went further than those that the industry could
agree on.
</P>
<P>
   Studies of the relationship between violence in entertainment
and actual violent conduct are inconclusive. But polls show that
more than 80 percent of American adults believe there is a
connection, a popular view not lost on politicians.
</P>
<P>
   The commission report had led the industry ``to take a fresh new
look at the way we market films,'' Valenti said.
</P>
<P>
   At the hearing two weeks ago, senators were especially critical
of the practice cited in the report of using children as young as
12 in groups that test-marketed R-rated movies.
</P>
<P>
   Valenti indicated, though he did not say directly, that this
practice would be abandoned. He said children under 17 would
participate in focus groups only if accompanied by adults, and he
said some material that might be acceptable for 15- and
16-year-olds should not be shown to much younger children.
</P>
<P>
   He said the movie makers would also begin explaining the reasons
particular movies received an R rating _ whether for violence,
nudity, bad language or sexual content _ in print advertising and
on official movie Web sites and would include this information in
videocassettes.
</P>
<P>
   He rejected the suggestion that the movie companies should
simply stop all marketing of R-rated movies to children. Some
movies with an R rating because of violent scenes like ``Saving
Private Ryan'' are not only acceptable but worthwhile for some
children, Valenti said. He suggested that it was reasonable to try
to get children to persuade their parents to take them.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, he said, movie companies should be allowed to
advertise during popular programs like the Super Bowl, even though
many children would be watching.
</P>
<P>
   ``How on earth,'' he asked, ``can you advertise anything that
some kids won't be watching?''

   LOS ANGELES _ Dick Wolf eschews the expensive sports clothes and
open-necked shirts that are de rigueur for rival television kings
like Steven Bochco and David E. Kelley. Instead, with his
slicked-back hair, cuff-linked off-white shirt, expensive tie and
sleek suit, Wolf resembles a very successful businessman.
</P>
<P>
   Which he is.
</P>
<P>
   The busiest writer-producer on television, the 53-year-old Wolf
will have four shows on the air this fall _ including the
longest-running dramatic series on television, NBC's ``Law and
Order.'' A fifth Wolf show is planned for early next year.
</P>
<P>
   ``What I love about television is you write it and six, seven
weeks later you're watching it,'' said Wolf, seated in the
commissary of Universal Studios, where his shows are written. ``And
nobody at any movie studio is making the kind of socially aware or
socially provocative feature films that you see almost every night
on television. Nobody. It's a genre that's disappeared. Except on
television.''
</P>
<P>
   Especially on Wolf's shows.
</P>
<P>
   His most anticipated new show is NBC's ``Deadline'' (Mondays,
9-10 p.m.), which starts Monday. In this drama series, Oliver Platt
plays a crusading columnist for a New York tabloid newspaper who
recruits graduate students to help uncover what the city's power
brokers often want to keep buried. The columnist, according to
Platt, is a kind of composite of Jimmy Breslin, Mike McAlary,
Murray Kempton and Mike Royko (although it's unlikely that these
columnists used graduate students to help them).
</P>
<P>
   Platt, a skilled 40-year-old character actor (``Bulworth,''
``Dr. Dolittle''), had been sought for years by television
producers. He even turned down the Dylan McDermott role on ``The
Practice.'' But last year Platt told a friend, David Kissinger,
president of programming at Studios USA Television, which is Wolf's
producing partner, that he was weary of traveling to movie sets and
missed his wife and three children in New York. Was there a New
York-based television series available?
</P>
<P>
   Kissinger told Wolf, who had been thinking of a newspaper
series. The role of the columnist was quickly designed for Platt.
The cast of ``Deadline'' also includes Tom Conti as the media mogul
who owns the tabloid and Bebe Neuwirth as an editor, as well as
Hope Davis and Lili Taylor.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've always wanted to do a newspaper show,'' Wolf said. ``I
liked `Lou Grant.' I loved `Front Page.' And what I wanted to do
was deal with a columnist, not a reporter. The knock on newspaper
shows is that a reporter reports. He's a passive protagonist. He
has to wait for things to happen. A columnist doesn't. A columnist
is not limited by objectivity. A columnist can smell something and
say, `This is what I want to do.' A columnist can drive the action,
which is the essence of drama.''
</P>
<P>
   Platt said his only concern in taking the job was signing a
commitment for five years. ``It's scary,'' he said. ``But then
again you have the opportunity to collaborate with a guy like Dick
Wolf, to build a character from the ground up and establish a world
and spin it out. The oversimplified personal question I had was, Do
I want consistently good writing and to sleep in my own bed and be
with my family and have a steady gig, or do I want wildly erratic
writing and to sleep in hotels and come home exhausted from a film
set? Was there any doubt?''
</P>
<P>
   The series starts the same night another new Wolf show, ``Arrest
and Trial,'' is to make its debut on Channel 9 in New York. This
nationally syndicated show, to be seen five days a week on 170
stations, blends reality with dramatic re-creations as it follows
highly charged and violent criminal cases from the police
investigation to the verdict. Interviews with law enforcement
officers are interspersed with scenes enacted by actors portraying
victims and killers. Brian Dennehy, who won a Tony Award last year
as best actor for his performance in ``Death of a Salesman,''
serves as the host.
</P>
<P>
   ``What's really fascinating for me is using real cops and real
prosecutors as well as file footage and some re-creations,'' said
Wolf, who is producing the show with Robert Port, president of
Maury Povich's Mo Po Entertainment. In contrast to successful
reality shows like ``Cops,'' the new series explores a crime by
re-enacting it through the use of often grainy film and tape that
seeks to blur the line between reality and fiction.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm a crime junkie,'' Wolf said. ``Cops and prosecutors are
kind of unsung heroes. And this is a chance of getting real people
on camera and seeing who they are.''
</P>
<P>
   Wolf has been obsessed with cops and prosecutors for 25 years.
He grew up relatively affluent in Manhattan, the son of an
advertising executive. He attended Phillips Academy in Andover,
Mass., and the University of Pennsylvania, where he majored in
English. After graduation he worked in advertising for eight years.
``I did landmark advertising campaigns _ `Can't beat Crest for
fighting cavities!' Remember that?''
</P>
<P>
   By the time he reached 30, Wolf wanted to quit advertising and
write screenplays. In 1977, at the height of the skateboard craze,
he sold his first script to Universal: ``Skateboard,'' which was
made into a movie starring Leif Garrett. ``A memorable movie,''
Wolf said dryly. But he had a talent for writing commercial films,
and three were made: ``No Man's Land'' (1987), ``Masquerade''
(1988) and ``School Ties'' (1992), about anti-Semitism at a fancy
prep school. None of the films were especially successful (although
``School Ties'' is notable for featuring a cast of young actors who
later went on to become stars, among them Matt Damon, Ben Affleck,
Chris O'Donnell and Brendan Fraser).
</P>
<P>
   ``It took 11 years to get made and then made 11 cents,'' Wolf
said of ``School Ties.'' He added: ``I deserted the movie business
because of frustration. You can really get old waiting for pictures
to get made.''
</P>
<P>
   By the early 1980s, Wolf and his family had moved to Los Angeles
from New York. While writing film scripts, he also began working on
such television shows as ``Hill Street Blues'' and ``Miami Vice.''
In the meantime, he developed ``Law and Order'' for Fox, but it was
rejected by Barry Diller, who then ran the company. (Ironically,
Diller has now taken over Studios USA, which is producing the
show.) CBS also rejected it. Brandon Tartikoff, then the
entertainment chief at NBC, reluctantly agreed to take ``Law and
Order'' on the condition that Wolf also develop and work on a
series called ``Nasty Boys,'' about a Las Vegas police unit. To the
surprise of NBC, ``Nasty Boys'' died quickly. ``Law and Order,''
after a slow start, began building an audience.
</P>
<P>
   Cast turnover has marked the show _ partly because Wolf wants to
keep altering the characters to keep the series fresh, and partly
because some actors, like Benjamin Bratt, have wanted to move on to
film careers. In the new season, Steven Hill, who has long played
the grumpy district attorney, Adam Schiff, is being replaced by
Dianne Wiest.
</P>
<P>
   The actors on Wolf's shows speak of him with a bit of awe. ``I
get along with him fine, but I don't think he's an easygoing guy,''
said Jerry Orbach, whose career before ``Law and Order'' was, like
that of most of the actors on that show, on the New York stage.
``He's kind of a type A personality, on the phone a lot.''
</P>
<P>
   Orbach added: ``I think Dick's special talent is that he crosses
a lot of lines and always surprises you. Some guys are good with
the police, some guys are good with the legal stuff, some have a
sense of humor, some are serious. Dick seems to have a little bit
of everything, and that's unusual.''
</P>
<P>
   Like ``Law and Order'' and its spinoff, ``Law and Order: Special
Victims Unit'' (Fridays, 10-11 p.m.), which is in its second year,
``Deadline'' is set and filmed in New York. But its writing staff,
under Wolf, is based in Los Angeles at Universal Studios, whose
television division was sold to Studios USA.
</P>
<P>
   A fifth Wolf show, another spinoff of ``Law and Order,'' is also
in the works for NBC. Filming will probably start in December, with
13 episodes ready by the early summer, before the start of
threatened actor and writer strikes.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
   Wolf's skills _ and his ambition _ are a bit grandiose, almost
like those of an old-time movie mogul. He is constantly on the run
between his home near Santa Barbara, where he lives with his wife
and three children, and the studio in Universal City, as well as
New York.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's always in evidence, whether he's in person or not,'' said
Platt. ``He's very hands-on. He's very collaborative. And he picks
extraordinarily talented people to run his shows.''
</P>
<P>
   To oversee ``Law and Order'' this season, for example, Wolf has
hired the 78-year-old Arthur Penn, the director of such celebrated
films as ``Bonnie and Clyde'' and ``The Miracle Worker,'' to serve
as the new executive producer. He replaces Ed Sherin, who had been
on the job for seven years and wanted to take a break.
</P>
<P>
   The appointment of Penn is a modest breakthrough for older
people on television, an industry where age discrimination is
notorious and writers, producers and directors over 50 or even 40
try to hide how old they are. Wolf is also using the 69-year-old
Ted Kotcheff, director of ``North Dallas 40,'' as executive
producer of ``Law and Order: Special Victims Unit.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It's ridiculous,'' Wolf said. ``People are dropping off
credits on their resumes. They don't list `MASH' anymore because it
shows that they're older.''
</P>
<P>
   The fact that Wolf is blunt, energetic, a bit irascible and
independent-minded _ as well as highly successful _ seems to dazzle
and almost intimidate network executives. ``Dick's a bit of a
character; he's bigger than life,'' said Garth Ancier, president of
NBC Entertainment. ``He runs his organization like a well-oiled
machine. He has a very strong organization and has very, very good
taste in casting. He's shrewd. He gets you involved. He'll call and
say: `I have a great idea. Oliver Platt. I believe in him.' And
before you know it you're having breakfast with Oliver Platt. And
once you get Oliver Platt, you get Tom Conti and Bebe Neuwirth.
</P>
<P>
   ``You get a call from Dick saying, `I want to bring in a new
D.A. on ``Law and Order,'' and I want to get Dianne Wiest.' How can
I complain about that?''
</P>
<P>
   Kissinger, the Studios USA Television executive, said: ``Happily
for us, he's married his talent with an insatiable ambition. Dick's
just not content to have one show on the air. He views himself as
building a company. His ambition is to try to duplicate the days of
MTM, which in some ways he's doing.'' (MTM, run by Grant Tinker and
Mary Tyler Moore, was a top television producer in the 1970s).
</P>
<P>
   Certainly ``Law and Order,'' entering its 11th season, has
stamped Wolf's career. Now that the show is the longest-running
drama series on network television, he has hopes of seeing it match
``Gunsmoke,'' which ran for 20 years, as the longest-running
prime-time drama series ever ``I want to beat `Gunsmoke,''' he
said. ``We're renewed until 2005. It'll be a shame if we don't go
for the record.''
</P>
<P>
   By contrast to the characters on ABC's flashier ``NYPD Blue,''
officers and prosecutors on ``Law and Order'' are notable for their
absence of histrionics. Perhaps that is why ``Law and Order,''
although successful, has won only one Emmy as best drama series, in
1997, and why longtime cast members like Orbach and Sam Waterston
have never won.
</P>
<P>
   Wolf is plainly annoyed. ``We've been wildly underappreciated by
the Emmys and the Writers Guild,'' he said. ``It's not flashy. It's
not showy. It's not that type of writing. Jerry Orbach keeps
saying, `Can't you guys put someone dying in my arms so I can cry
and take a long time and maybe win an award?'''
</P>
<P>
   Despite such complaints, Wolf says he's doing exactly what he
wants to do, although the breakneck speed of television can leave
him bewildered and frustrated. ``I just try to hire extremely
obsessive people,'' he said. ``Otherwise it's so easy to get to
Episode 14, with eight to go. And you say, `Well, it's good
enough.' And once you say `it's good enough,' then it's bad, really
bad.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's like running a marathon. To churn out really A-level
work, it takes really obsessive-compulsive people.'' He laughed.
``Like me.''

REFUGEE LIBERIANS FACE DEPORTATION 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (a and i coding)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By CINDY RODRIGUEZ  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   The notices, terse as they always are, came in this week's mail:
``We are writing to inform you that your employment authorization
expires on the 28th of September.''
</P>
<P>
   Once again, 30-year-old Susan Shahda of Boston is worried about
how she'll provide for her two sons.
</P>
<P>
   ``Come Friday I won't have a job,'' Shahda said. ``What can I
do? I'm scared to death.''
</P>
<P>
   Shahda is one of the more than 10,000 Liberians who fled their
war-torn homeland in 1989 and have been living in refuge in the
United States ever since. They will lose their jobs Friday when
they become undocumented immigrants.
</P>
<P>
   Emigres from the troubled West African nation, including an
estimated 4,000 living in New England, were granted temporary work
permits until conditions are safe for them to return. Though civil
strife continues in Liberia, their right to live and work in the
United States will become uncertain unless Congress or the White
House intervenes.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't like that we have to live our lives like this. I can't
plan my life,'' said Mabel Dweh, who lives in Brockton, Mass. with
her two grown sons and daughter. ``We can't go back. Just by our
(tribal) name we would be killed.''
</P>
<P>
   For Dweh, the notice of job termination in the mail is part of
an annual ritual, where each year at this time the president issues
a last-minute reprieve. A White House source said Saturday that
President Bill Clinton is likely to extend the Deferred Enforced
Departure for Liberians for another year.
</P>
<P>
   In doing so, Clinton would put Liberians in limbo for a 12th
year, even as they've watched Europeans and Asians who have
emigrated to the United States under similar conditions leapfrog to
become US residents.
</P>
<P>
   ``To say year after year, `We're going to send them back,' is an
aggravation of the trauma we've experienced,'' said Torli Krua,
president of the Liberian Community Association of Massachusetts.
``Another extension is a difficult thing. We are grateful, but
people can't live this way.''
</P>
<P>
   A majority of the Liberians who fled to the United States are
educated professionals who could afford the trans-Atlantic flight.
The United States didn't recognize them as refugees, so they
emigrated instead and were given Temporary Protected Status.
</P>
<P>
   But the seven-year civil war that displaced half of the Liberian
population and resulted in the deaths of more than 150,000 people
kept the United States from sending the Liberians back home.
</P>
<P>
   Today, in much of the country there is no electricity,
unemployment hovers at about 85 percent, political foes are still
in prison, and the government of President Charles Taylor remains
unstable. In fact, much of the West African region is in chaos:
Sierra Leone is in the midst of a bloody civil war, and warring
factions have destroyed much of Guinea and the Ivory Coast. A State
Department advisory warns Americans against traveling in the
region.
</P>
<P>
   During the past decade, as America _ particularly Rhode Island
and Massachusetts _ provided a safe haven for Liberians, they have
bought homes and raised children. While some say they would like to
return to their homeland one day, they say they know what going
back would mean.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is no safety in the country,'' Dweh said. ``There is an
organized government but they have no control over the warring
factions.''
</P>
<P>
   When the civil war ended in 1997, US Attorney General Janet Reno
changed the status of Liberians from Temporary Protected Status to
Deferred Enforced Departure, a term that signaled they would
eventually have to leave. But Clinton has given extensions each
year since then because of the instability of the region.
</P>
<P>
   In the meantime, however, Congress granted residency to others
who had been here under Temporary Protected Status. According to an
aide of Rhode Island Senator Jack Reed, Congress in recent years
has allowed 4,996 Poles, 150,000 Nicaraguans, 200,000 Salvadorans,
and 52,968 Chinese to adjust their status to permanent residency.
</P>
<P>
   For that reason, Reed sponsored a bill this session that would
allow Liberians to also become US residents. Reed said he will try
to attach the bill as a provision to one of several bills that will
be voted on before the session ends in early October.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a matter of simple justice. They are good people. They've
come here and they've worked hard,'' Reed said. ``They face an
uncertain prospect, if not fatal prospect, if they return to
Liberia.''
</P>
<P>
   Reed doesn't believe that racism is an underlying issue that has
kept US policy toward Liberian emigres intact. It has more to do
with avoiding setting a precedent, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``These people deserve the opportunity to live more than year to
year,'' Reed said. ``Every year they worry that this year will be
their last in the US.''

DISPUTE OVER VIDEOTAPE UPSETS FRANCE
</HEADLINE>
  By SUZANNE DALEY   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   PARIS _ The polite, if strained, cooperation that has long
marked the relationship between France's two leaders _ President
Jacques Chirac and Prime Minister Lionel Jospin _ came apart on
Tuesday, as their supporters hurled accusations of corruption and
political manipulation at each other.
</P>
<P>
   Each side said the other was trying to wiggle away from its role
in the growing scandal springing from a videotaped confession that
charges Chirac with running a illicit fund-raising scheme when he
was mayor of Paris and the leader of his conservative Rally for the
Republic party.
</P>
<P>
   While it is Chirac who is directly accused in the videotape, the
scandal has also engulfed Jospin since it became known on Monday
that his former finance minister had the tape for two years without
turning it over to authorities. On Tuesday night, authorities
officially placed the former minister, Dominique Strauss-Kahn,
under investigation.
</P>
<P>
   But the parties seemed to be competing to tar each other with
the scandal, even as new evidence emerged suggesting that the man
who made the tape, a former party official who died of cancer last
year, was paid off not to go public with his story.
</P>
<P>
   Leading members of Chirac's party lashed out at Jospin for
denying any knowledge of the tape, which had been given to
Strauss-Kahn, in the summer of 1998. Jospin has said he knew
nothing of the tape until he read transcripts from it in the daily
Le Monde last week.
</P>
<P>
   ``I find it astonishing that the prime minister, as soon as
there is a problem, never has any knowledge of it,'' said Michele
Alliot-Marie, the current president of Chirac's party. ``I find
that astonishing, even worrying.''
</P>
<P>
   Jospin, at a Socialist meeting in Lyon, did not refer to Chirac
by name, but said that the uproar over Strauss-Kahn should not
overshadow the ``serious nature of the cases being investigated.''
</P>
<P>
   Jean-Marc Ayrault, the Socialist floor leader in the National
Assembly, went further, reminding Chirac that he would not always
enjoy presidential immunity. ``He should think twice about what
happens afterward, when justice can take its normal course.''
Ayrault said.
</P>
<P>
   Chirac has denied the charges on the tape made by Jean-Claude
Mery, a developer who was a member of the Rally for the Republic
governing committee in the 1980s. According to transcripts
published in Le Monde, Mery gave a detailed description of how he
ran a huge network of kickback schemes that netted the party
millions of dollars a year. On the tape, he says he worked under
the instructions of Chirac, and that he was even present one day
when Mery gave a Chirac aide about $700,000 in cash.
</P>
<P>
   Mery, who had already spent five months in jail while a
magistrate pursued his investigation of the party for illicit
fund-raising, said on the tape that he was making it to protect
himself and because promises made to him had not been kept.
</P>
<P>
   The tape emerged when a journalist, Arnaud Hamelin, who had
helped Mery make the tape, took it to Le Monde. Mery had wanted the
tape to be made public if he died under suspicious circumstances.
The journalist was authorized to do what he wanted with the tape if
he died, as he did, of natural causes.
</P>
<P>
   On Tuesday, Le Monde said that investigators searching a bank
vault had found two letters Mery had written addressed simply to
``Mr. President.'' In them, he complained that he had only been
paid about $13,000 for staying quiet. The paper said one letter
appeared to be an original, suggesting it had never been sent.
</P>

   Despite searching the home and office of Strauss-Kahn on Monday
night, investigators have not yet found the original copy of the
Mery videotape. The weekly magazine L'Express, which first reported
that Strauss-Kahn had the tape, said it had been given to him by a
lawyer, who helped Mery make his tape, in exchange for a tax break
for one of his other clients, Karl Lagerfeld, the fashion designer.
Lagerfeld denied any impropriety in the handling of his taxes.
</P>
<P>
   Strauss-Kahn, who was forced last year to resign his ministerial
post after allegations of false accounting at his law firm, also
denied all wrongdoing. He said Lagerfeld had eventually paid about
half of what he owed in a negotiated transaction that was a routine
way of handling such cases.
</P>
<P>
   Strauss-Kahn urged everyone to focus on the real issue: the
implication of the chief of state in a scandal. ``The tree must not
hide the forest,'' he said Tuesday on Europe 1 radio.

   CHENEY-PROFILE _ Troy, Mich. - No one is suggesting that Dick
Cheney is winning votes left and right with his stem-winding
oratory. The former Defense Secretary is so reserved that even when
he is on the attack, he peppers his remarks with ``if you will''
and ``it seems to me.'' The Cheney who is best at campaigning is
not Dick, but his wife, Lynne, who tries to humanize her husband
when she introduces him. (Sherman, The Altanta

   LIEBPROFILE _ ORLANDO, Fla. _ C-Span's cameras are rolling,

of television interviews via satellite. Kiki McLean, his press
secretary, interjects, ``You're on C-Span, sir.'' Lieberman is a

sprinkling Yiddish into his talks, always making sure to remind
listeners of the economic growth of the past eight years. (Sherman,

others like it, profound changes are already rippling through the

3COM'S REPORTED LOSS IS LESS THAN ANTICIPATED 
</HEADLINE>
   By LAWRENCE M. FISHER   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ 3Com Corp. reported a smaller-than-expected
first-quarter loss Tuesday, citing a reorganization that included
its exit from the analog modem and network router businesses in the
previous quarter.
</P>
<P>
   For the quarter ended Sept. 1, 3Com posted a loss of $59.2
million, or 17 cents a share, compared with earnings of $137.5
million, or 38 cents a share, in the period a year earlier. Sales
fell 23 percent, to $933.8 million from $1.21 billion.
</P>
<P>
   Sales included $127.5 million from the businesses it left.
Excluding that revenue, 3Com's continuing businesses accounted for
$806.3 million in sales, a rise of 20 percent over comparable sales
in the fourth quarter.
</P>
<P>
   Excluding one-time charges and gains as well as income from
discontinued operations, 3Com's quarterly loss was $41.3 million,
or 12 cents a share. Analysts had expected a loss of 33 cents a
share, according to First Call/Thomson Financial.
</P>
<P>
   Before 3Com reported its results, its shares closed at $13.94,
down 6 cents, in Nasdaq trading. In after-hours trading, however,
3Com rose more than 15 percent, climbing as high as $16.06.
</P>
<P>
   Shares of 3Com had retreated from a 52-week high, reached before
the divestiture in July of Palm Inc., which many analysts
considered the most valuable part of the company. 3Com now has a
market value of $4.86 billion, while Palm, which handily beat
analysts' earnings estimates, is valued at $31.36 billion.
</P>
<P>
   ``The close of our first quarter marks the completion of our
restructuring,'' said Eric Benhamou, the chairman and chief
executive of 3Com, in a statement. ``The transformation milestones
and business objectives set forth in March 2000 and reaffirmed last
quarter were completed on or ahead of schedule.''
</P>
<P>
   In the wake of the spinoff of Palm and the reorganization, 3Com
is focused primarily on broadband products and wireless devices for
consumers and small businesses, and infrastructure equipment for
companies that provide telecommunications and Internet services.
The move cedes much of the market for corporate networks to Cisco
Systems Inc., which has proved to be the more aggressive
competitor.
</P>
<P>
   3Com said that, excluding sales from the exited businesses,
first-quarter sales for its commercial and consumer networks
business were $639.1 million, a 24 percent increase over the fourth
quarter. First-quarter sales for its carrier networking business
were $167.2 million, a rise of 7 percent compared with sales of
$156.7 million in the fourth quarter.

REFUGEE LIBERIANS FACE DEPORTATION

<P>
   The notices, terse as they always are, came in this week's mail:
``We are writing to inform you that your employment authorization
expires on the 28th of September.''
</P>
<P>
   Once again, 30-year-old Susan Shahda of Boston is worried about
how she'll provide for her two sons.
</P>
<P>
   ``Come Friday I won't have a job,'' Shahda said. ``What can I
do? I'm scared to death.''
</P>
<P>
   Shahda is one of the more than 10,000 Liberians who fled their
war-torn homeland in 1989 and have been living in refuge in the
United States ever since. They will lose their jobs Friday when
they become undocumented immigrants.
</P>
<P>
   Emigres from the troubled West African nation, including an
estimated 4,000 living in New England, were granted temporary work
permits until conditions are safe for them to return. Though civil
strife continues in Liberia, their right to live and work in the
United States will become uncertain unless Congress or the White
House intervenes.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't like that we have to live our lives like this. I can't
plan my life,'' said Mabel Dweh, who lives in Brockton, Mass. with
her two grown sons and daughter. ``We can't go back. Just by our
(tribal) name we would be killed.''
</P>
<P>
   For Dweh, the notice of job termination in the mail is part of
an annual ritual, where each year at this time the president issues
a last-minute reprieve. A White House source said Tuesday that
President Bill Clinton is likely to extend the Deferred Enforced
Departure for Liberians for another year.
</P>
<P>
   In doing so, Clinton would put Liberians in limbo for a 12th
year, even as they've watched Europeans and Asians who have
emigrated to the United States under similar conditions leapfrog to
become US residents.
</P>
<P>
   ``To say year after year, `We're going to send them back,' is an
aggravation of the trauma we've experienced,'' said Torli Krua,
president of the Liberian Community Association of Massachusetts.
``Another extension is a difficult thing. We are grateful, but
people can't live this way.''
</P>
<P>
   A majority of the Liberians who fled to the United States are
educated professionals who could afford the trans-Atlantic flight.
The United States didn't recognize them as refugees, so they
emigrated instead and were given Temporary Protected Status.
</P>
<P>
   But the seven-year civil war that displaced half of the Liberian
population and resulted in the deaths of more than 150,000 people
kept the United States from sending the Liberians back home.
</P>
<P>
   Today, in much of the country there is no electricity,
unemployment hovers at about 85 percent, political foes are still
in prison, and the government of President Charles Taylor remains
unstable. In fact, much of the West African region is in chaos:
Sierra Leone is in the midst of a bloody civil war, and warring
factions have destroyed much of Guinea and the Ivory Coast. A State
Department advisory warns Americans against traveling in the
region.
</P>
<P>
   During the past decade, as America _ particularly Rhode Island
and Massachusetts _ provided a safe haven for Liberians, they have
bought homes and raised children. While some say they would like to
return to their homeland one day, they say they know what going
back would mean.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is no safety in the country,'' Dweh said. ``There is an
organized government but they have no control over the warring
factions.''
</P>
<P>
   When the civil war ended in 1997, US Attorney General Janet Reno
changed the status of Liberians from Temporary Protected Status to
Deferred Enforced Departure, a term that signaled they would
eventually have to leave. But Clinton has given extensions each
year since then because of the instability of the region.
</P>
<P>
   In the meantime, however, Congress granted residency to others
who had been here under Temporary Protected Status. According to an
aide of Rhode Island Senator Jack Reed, Congress in recent years
has allowed 4,996 Poles, 150,000 Nicaraguans, 200,000 Salvadorans,
and 52,968 Chinese to adjust their status to permanent residency.
</P>
<P>
   For that reason, Reed sponsored a bill this session that would
allow Liberians to also become US residents. Reed said he will try
to attach the bill as a provision to one of several bills that will
be voted on before the session ends in early October.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a matter of simple justice. They are good people. They've
come here and they've worked hard,'' Reed said. ``They face an
uncertain prospect, if not fatal prospect, if they return to
Liberia.''
</P>
<P>
   Reed doesn't believe that racism is an underlying issue that has
kept US policy toward Liberian emigres intact. It has more to do
with avoiding setting a precedent, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``These people deserve the opportunity to live more than year to
year,'' Reed said. ``Every year they worry that this year will be
their last in the US.''

AS JAPANESE COMPANIES FALTER, A SURGE IN CRISIS MANAGEMENT  
</HEADLINE>
   By MIKI TANIKAWA    
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   TOKYO _ The Tokyo Chamber of Commerce and Industry thought it
might be a good idea to prepare a handbook for member companies
interested in learning how to cope more effectively with the media
during a crisis.
</P>
<P>
   Its idea was so good the chamber badly underestimated the
demand. The 1,000 copies it had printed in mid-July sold out in a
day. To catch up, it printed an additional 37,000, then 5,000 more.
</P>
<P>
   Corporate Japan has suddenly awakened to the need for crisis
control. Unsettled because of the public relations blunders
committed by big Japanese companies like Bridgestone, Mitsubishi
Motors and Snow Brand in recent weeks, Japanese managers are
scrambling to learn how to avoid the appearance of looking
irresponsible and uncaring.
</P>
<P>
   Officials in charge of general affairs or public relations are
collecting books and literature on crisis management, calling
consultants for seminars and training sessions, and rethinking the
way their companies handle public crises.
</P>
<P>
   Tatsumi Tanaka, a Tokyo crisis management consultant, said his
firm had been swamped with requests for lectures and seminars _ 10
times the requests he had been getting before July, when
revelations of corporate skulduggery seemed to start coming all at
once.
</P>
<P>
   First there was a scandal at Snow Brand, a leading producer of
milk and dairy products, which was held responsible for a food
poisoning that sickened more than 10,000 people. Then Mitsubishi
Motors admitted it had concealed customer complaints about faulty
automobiles for more than two decades. More recently, Bridgestone
has been criticized in the Japanese media over the defective tires
sold by the company's Firestone subsidiary, mostly in the United
States. Bridgestone officials, who at first seemed to treat the
scandal as a minor event in a foreign country, are now grappling
with public relations damage here in Japan.
</P>
<P>
   Nihon Keizai Shimbun, Japan's leading economic daily,
editorialized recently that while Ford conducted a highly effective
public relations campaign that blamed the tires, ``Bridgestone's
silence strategy failed in that it only bred mistrust in consumers
and investors.''
</P>
<P>
   Glen Fukushima, president in Japan of the consulting firm Arthur
D. Little, said: ``PR is not considered all that important. You can
see that from the fact that public relations is not a big industry
here.''
</P>
<P>
   There are about 200 public relations firms in Japan, a fraction
of the number in the United States, and the majority of them are
one-man operations. Most public relations work at these firms
revolves around product and service promotions and rarely deals
with crisis management.
</P>
<P>
   A survey done by the Tokyo Chamber of Commerce of member
companies showed that only 11 percent of the respondents said they
would contact a public relations firm or an advertising agency when
a major crisis hit their company.
</P>
<P>
   ``Dealing with the media in a crisis is where Japanese companies
are the weakest,'' said Atsushi Kuse, a crisis management expert.
Consequently, he said, their response to the public often deviates
wildly from what the public perceives as right.
</P>
<P>
   Companies implicated in scandal often admit to only a small
portion of what later turns out to be a systematic flaw in the
company's products or quality control, as was the case with
Mitsubishi and Snow Brand.
</P>
<P>
   Sometimes, chief executives utter inadvertent remarks as they
flounder through news conferences. When Snow Brand's president,
Tetsuro Ishikawa, who resigned in disgrace in July, was confronted
with a reporter asking him why he decided to cut short the news
conference, Ishikawa replied under the gaze of TV cameras: ``You! I
haven't even been sleeping these days.'' The nationally televised
scene was broadcast repeatedly.
</P>
<P>
   Corporate attitudes toward public relations in Japan have been
shaped partly by the country's postwar economic boom, when
manufacturers mass-produced quality products at what were
considered fair prices, industrial companies grew and people's
standard of living rose.
</P>
<P>
   The small number of consumer complaints were ignored or
suppressed.
</P>
<P>
   But the sensibilities of Japanese consumers have changed
drastically in recent years. Their tastes have diversified and they
are armed with information tools that they can use to compare
products.
</P>
<P>
   ``Japan's society is changing,'' Tanaka said. ``Companies
haven't realized that.''
</P>
<P>
   Even when Tanaka is called in by a scandal-hit company to
consult, he said, the management often remains dishonest. ``First,
they lie to me,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Another new variable is the gradual demise of Japan's lifetime
employment. The readiness of many big companies to shed unwanted
workers is spawning a growing number of disgruntled workers who no
longer display the loyalty to their employers they once did.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, the Mitsubishi cover-up scandal came to light when an
insider tipped off transport ministry officials about the car
company's practices.

CLINTON PROMISES BUDGET VETO OVER IMMIGRATION ISSUE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By SUSAN MILLIGAN  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ President Clinton is threatening to veto a
multibillion-dollar spending bill unless Republicans agree to
include a provision allowing certain Latinos and other immigrants
to stay in the country, the White House confirmed Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   The immigration matter is of great importance to Hispanic
voters, a constituency that could make the difference in the
presidential race as well as in several races for the House, where
the Republicans' thin majority is under siege.
</P>
<P>
   Congressional Democrats called it a question of basic decency,
saying a bureaucratic glitch has prevented otherwise eligible
immigrants from gaining permanent residency status. The measure,
sponsored by Senator Edward M. Kennedy, Democrat of Massachusetts,
would grant green cards to qualified immigrants who have been
living in the United States since before 1986.
</P>
<P>
   But Clinton's veto threat had Republicans complaining of a White
House pattern of making policy to assist Vice President Al Gore in
what is shaping up as the closest presidential race in recent
history.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's all about electoral politics,'' said John Czwartacki,
spokesman for Senate Majority Leader Trent Lott, Republican of
Mississippi.
</P>
<P>
   ``They are completely shameless,'' fumed John Feehery, spokesman
for House Speaker J. Dennis Hastert, Republican of Illinois.
</P>
<P>
   Gore spokesman Doug Hattaway denied the charge. ``The president
is doing his job, and administering policies to help the American
people,'' Hattway said.
</P>
<P>
   On Monday, Clinton announced a $1.7 million grant to fight
domestic violence in New Mexico, a competititve state in the
presidential contest.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, Clinton announced he would release 30 million barrels
of oil from the Strategic Petroleum Reserve, a move intended to
ease home heating oil costs. The annoucement came the day after
Gore called for the release of oil from the emergency reserve, and
is likely to benefit homeowners in the battleground states of the
industrial Northeast.
</P>
<P>
   There's no ambiguity who would benefit from the immigration
measure, titled The Latino and Immigrant Fairness Act. Hispanics
are a key voting groups in Florida, perhaps the most important
presidential battleground state. In California, Latinos could make
the difference in several House races _ contests the Democratic
Congressional Campaign Committee says could tip the balance of
power in the House from Republican to Democrat.
</P>
<P>
   ``When it comes to the Latino community, immigration issues hit
close to home,'' said Alejandro Perez, executive director of the
Congressional Hispanic Caucus. ``You can get a sense of who is for
you and who is not. This will come up (in the campaigns), and the
records of Democrats and Republicans will be highlighted,'' Perez
said.
</P>
<P>
   Congressional Democrats met with Clinton last week, winning a
promise that he would veto more than $36 billion in funding for
programs administered by the Commerce, State and Justice
Departments if the immigration measure was not included. Clinton
demanded that Democratic leaders prove they had the votes to
sustain the threatened veto, a test the congressional Democrats met
Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   The veto threat is a powerful tool. Since the agencies must get
funded, Congress could be forced into an unwanted, post-election
session to finish the spending bill.
</P>
<P>
   ``We'll back them up,'' confirmed White House spokesman Jake
Siewert.
</P>
<P>
   Representative Luis Gutierrez, Democrat of Ilinois, denied that
the pressure to pass the immigration bill was meant as a political
ploy. But he did hint at the potential for political fallout,
adding: ``If you want to show Latinos that you mean what you say,
this is the way to do it.''
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, the immigration dispute threatens to hold up passage
of a widely supported bill to extend special visas for skilled
workers, a measure Massachusetts techology firms say they
desperately need to fill job openings.
</P>
<P>
   House Democrats charge that the Republican leadership is
refusing to bring the visa bill up for a vote, afraid that
Democrats would try to attach the immigration language to it and
force the Republicans into an up-or-down vote on an issue so
important to Hispanics.
</P>
<P>
   ``What we're afraid of is charges of racism by the Democrats,
who like to charge racism any chance they get,'' Feehery said.

<P>
   ATLANTA _ His album ``Aaron's Party (Come Get It)'' hit stores
Tuesday morning. And Aaron Carter, the younger brother of
Backstreet Boy Nick Carter, hit the parking lot of Wal-Mart in
Roswell, Ga., on Tuesday afternoon.
</P>
<P>
   Twelve-year-old Aaron isn't yet the magnet for teeny-boppers
that his brother is. But he does pretty well with
teeny-tiny-boppers _ fifth-graders, say _ several dozen of whom
turned out for a brief concert near the tire and lube wing of the
giant retail store or waited in line for autographs in the garden
center.
</P>
<P>
   ``My 11-year-old daughter is supposed to be at cheerleader
practice,'' said Teresa Adams, 41, of Cumming. ``I don't think
she'll make it.'' Adams stood first in line for autographs while
daughter Samantha waited by the makeshift stage.
</P>

   Charlie Guerraro, 43, of Alpharetta, brought his daughters
Marianna, 5, and Andrea, 9, who agreed in chorus about Aaron:
``He's cute.''

   The kids were eager to see the boy singer, but this was not,
say, the Beatles at Shea Stadium. Carter's fans are, well, young.
When the singer's appearance was delayed an hour due to a late
plane, the grade-schoolers made use of the time by jumping over
plastic cones in the parking lot.

   TECH GAP: The thing that concerns parents more than the
commercial exploitation of children is the impact of technology,
says Enola Aird, director of the Motherhood Project at the
Institute for American Values. ``It is changing the experience of
childhood,'' says Aird. ``All the traditional boundaries that
protected children from the adult world are coming down.'' Some say
it is arguably the most significant demarcation between generations
in history. Says Mary Kay Blakely, author of ``American Mom:''
``Not only are we being bumped off the demographic map,'' but
teenagers are ``bringing along a culture that we know diddly-squat
about. It's unseemly. We can't hand them the baton; they already
have the baton. They're inventing the baton.''
</P>
<P>
   THAT'S ENTERTAINMENT? Netheads who want to be in pictures are
going online to raise more than $500,000 for an upcoming feature
film that has no title, script or major studio behind it. Since
June, a Yahoo-sponsored Web site has been auctioning
``sponsorships'' to star, produce or play bit roles in the flick.
Adam Rifkin (``Mouse Hunt,'' ``Small Soldiers'') is writing a
script to display the diverse personalities of the online bidders
who already have been cast, including a kick-boxing champ, a
General Motors employee, a florist and a psychic. The auction
continues until Oct. 10 to fill four other acting roles and two
producing positions. A band to score the movie also is being
sought. The total budget, including online auction proceeds, is
$1.5 million, most of which was raised by four companies
underwriting the project.

   E-GIVING: Have a big heart, feel like a big spender, hang out
with bigwigs. That's the concept behind Stargiving.com, a new Web
site that mixes fame with philanthropy. Visitors can click on icons
of ex-NBA star Magic Johnson, Darius Rucker of Hootie &AMP; the
Blowfish, supermodel Niki Taylor or boxing legend Muhammad Ali.
When they do, the site's corporate sponsors kick in a donation (up
to a dime per visit) to the celebrity's favorite charity. The
celebrity with the most clicks wins, and his or her charity gets a
corporate donation. Visitors also can enter a raffle for a chance
to spend face time with their favorite celeb (hoops with Magic,
golf with Rucker, etc.). The only catch: To qualify for a celebrity
``experience,'' you must be at least 18 and submit you name and
phone number in case you win.

REFUGEE LIBERIANS FACE DEPORTATION

<P>
   The notices, terse as they always are, came in this week's mail:
``We are writing to inform you that your employment authorization
expires on the 28th of September.''
</P>
<P>
   Once again, 30-year-old Susan Shahda of Boston is worried about
how she'll provide for her two sons.
</P>
<P>
   ``Come Friday I won't have a job,'' Shahda said. ``What can I
do? I'm scared to death.''
</P>
<P>
   Shahda is one of the more than 10,000 Liberians who fled their
war-torn homeland in 1989 and have been living in refuge in the
United States ever since. They will lose their jobs Friday when
they become undocumented immigrants.
</P>
<P>
   Emigres from the troubled West African nation, including an
estimated 4,000 living in New England, were granted temporary work
permits until conditions are safe for them to return. Though civil
strife continues in Liberia, their right to live and work in the
United States will become uncertain unless Congress or the White
House intervenes.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't like that we have to live our lives like this. I can't
plan my life,'' said Mabel Dweh, who lives in Brockton, Mass. with
her two grown sons and daughter. ``We can't go back. Just by our
(tribal) name we would be killed.''
</P>
<P>
   For Dweh, the notice of job termination in the mail is part of
an annual ritual, where each year at this time the president issues
a last-minute reprieve. A White House source said Tuesday that
President Bill Clinton is likely to extend the Deferred Enforced
Departure for Liberians for another year.
</P>
<P>
   In doing so, Clinton would put Liberians in limbo for a 12th
year, even as they've watched Europeans and Asians who have
emigrated to the United States under similar conditions leapfrog to
become US residents.
</P>
<P>
   ``To say year after year, `We're going to send them back,' is an
aggravation of the trauma we've experienced,'' said Torli Krua,
president of the Liberian Community Association of Massachusetts.
``Another extension is a difficult thing. We are grateful, but
people can't live this way.''
</P>
<P>
   A majority of the Liberians who fled to the United States are
educated professionals who could afford the trans-Atlantic flight.
The United States didn't recognize them as refugees, so they
emigrated instead and were given Temporary Protected Status.
</P>
<P>
   But the seven-year civil war that displaced half of the Liberian
population and resulted in the deaths of more than 150,000 people
kept the United States from sending the Liberians back home.
</P>
<P>
   Today, in much of the country there is no electricity,
unemployment hovers at about 85 percent, political foes are still
in prison, and the government of President Charles Taylor remains
unstable. In fact, much of the West African region is in chaos:
Sierra Leone is in the midst of a bloody civil war, and warring
factions have destroyed much of Guinea and the Ivory Coast. A State
Department advisory warns Americans against traveling in the
region.
</P>
<P>
   During the past decade, as America _ particularly Rhode Island
and Massachusetts _ provided a safe haven for Liberians, they have
bought homes and raised children. While some say they would like to
return to their homeland one day, they say they know what going
back would mean.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is no safety in the country,'' Dweh said. ``There is an
organized government but they have no control over the warring
factions.''
</P>
<P>
   When the civil war ended in 1997, US Attorney General Janet Reno
changed the status of Liberians from Temporary Protected Status to
Deferred Enforced Departure, a term that signaled they would
eventually have to leave. But Clinton has given extensions each
year since then because of the instability of the region.
</P>
<P>
   In the meantime, however, Congress granted residency to others
who had been here under Temporary Protected Status. According to an
aide of Rhode Island Senator Jack Reed, Congress in recent years
has allowed 4,996 Poles, 150,000 Nicaraguans, 200,000 Salvadorans,
and 52,968 Chinese to adjust their status to permanent residency.
</P>
<P>
   For that reason, Reed sponsored a bill this session that would
allow Liberians to also become US residents. Reed said he will try
to attach the bill as a provision to one of several bills that will
be voted on before the session ends in early October.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a matter of simple justice. They are good people. They've
come here and they've worked hard,'' Reed said. ``They face an
uncertain prospect, if not fatal prospect, if they return to
Liberia.''
</P>
<P>
   Reed doesn't believe that racism is an underlying issue that has
kept US policy toward Liberian emigres intact. It has more to do
with avoiding setting a precedent, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``These people deserve the opportunity to live more than year to
year,'' Reed said. ``Every year they worry that this year will be
their last in the US.''

POLICE SEEK SUSPECT IN STABBING OF BASKETEBAL STAR 
</HEADLINE>

 c.2000 The Boston Globe

<P>
   BOSTON _ Police are looking for a local rap artist in the early
Monday stabbing that left Boston Celtics star Paul Pierce
recovering from numerous stab wounds, a police source said.
</P>
<P>
   As investigators Tuesday night sought to question 27-year-old
Michael McNeill _ a rapper with a history of arrests and ties to
the controversial rap group Made Men _ a close friend of Pierce who
helped drive him to the hospital adamantly denied media reports
that the stabbing was a revenge attack.
</P>
<P>
   ``Paul does not know any of these guys, period,'' said Derrick
Battie, speaking publicly for the first time since he and his
brother, Tony Battie, witnessed the stabbing and intervened to stop
it. ``Neither does Tony, neither do I. . . . We've never had a
confrontation, ever, with anybody.''
</P>
<P>
   On Monday, two members of Made Men acknowledged being at the
party at the Buzz Club that Pierce had attended with two close
friends, but denied any involvement in the knifing.
</P>
<P>
   But a police source said the investigation was now focusing on
McNeil, whose ties to Made Men date back at least four years.
</P>
<P>
   Two years ago, McNeill recorded songs with Made Men front-man
Raymond ``Ray Dog'' Scott for the record ``Wiseguys,'' a
collaboration of rappers and former rivals from Boston's infamous,
hard-core gangs.
</P>
<P>
   McNeill recorded the track ``Manhood'' for the album, which
Scott promoted in 1998 as preaching unity and urging youth to
reject the hustle of guns, drugs and turf.
</P>
<P>
   But as recently as July, McNeill was arrested for driving a
stolen car and driving without a license. And in 1996, he and three
other defendants were charged with kidnapping and assault in a
brutal case in which they allegedly pulled in front of a hous in
the city's Roxbury section, dragged a bound and gagged man into an
apartment and held him prisoner until he broke through a window,
bleeding and screaming for help.
</P>
<P>
   Among the others arrested in that incident was Robert Daniels,
whom witnesses then identified as a member of Made Men.
</P>
<P>
   An associate of Made Men, Leroy Peoples, said he knew McNeill,
but that the rapper was not a member of the rap group.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's from the industry,'' Peoples said. ``But he's not one of
Made Men.''
</P>
<P>
   Battie, whose brother, Tony Battie, plays for the Celtics, said
he had spent most of the day Monday at New England Medical Center,
where Pierce was recovering from stab wounds to the neck, face and
back.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's been a long, tedious 48 hours,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Battie said that he, his brother and Pierce often go out and
spend time together, and are careful to steer clear of trouble.
</P>
<P>
   Of Pierce, he said, ``I don't think Paul was a target. I would
not say any guys we hang out with are targets. It's just one of
those ignorant situations where someone gets unruly.''
</P>
<P>
   The Boston Herald reported the attack on Pierce stemmed from a
confrontation Pierce had had the night before outside another
lounge. Other broadcast reports said that the assault was tied to a
dispute over a woman.
</P>
<P>
   While denying that Pierce was deliberately targeted, Battie did
not offer an alternative scenario of what happened to spur an
attack that seemed intensely personal.
</P>
<P>
   As police continued the investigation into the stabbing and the
nightclub where it occurred, Boston Police spokeswoman Mariellen
Burns said the Buzz Club was cited for assault with a dangerous
weapon on their premises and failing to notify police in a proper
manner.
</P>
<P>
   Police sources have said that the club's manager wrapped
makeshift bandages around Pierce's wounds but did not call police.
The sources said the manager later denied knowing about the
stabbing when police interviewed him.
</P>
<P>
   Burns said more citations may be forthcoming pending an
investigation into the troubled nightclub.
</P>
<P>
   The club's manager, Robert LaBerge, said he was not aware of the
citations and had not been contacted by police.
</P>
<P>
   Sources close to Pierce said the top draft pick from Kansas
changed rooms and was up and walking around. Hospital officials
upgraded his condition from fair to good.

THORNTON, SAMSONOV ARE BACK WITH BRUINS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By NANCY MARRAPESE-BURRELL  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ In the end, it was a meeting of the minds that got it
done.
</P>
<P>
   When push came to shove, the agents for Sergei Samsonov and Joe
Thornton pooled their resources in the form of a conference call
with Bruins assistant general manager Mike O'Connell and the sides
came to agreement on three-year, $5.35 million contracts Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   The forwards are expected to have their physicals Wednesday
morning and join their teammates for practice at the FleetCenter.
</P>
<P>
   Both Thornton and Samsonov are scheduled to be paid $1.55
million this year, $1.75 million next year, and $2.05 million in
the final year. There are also achievable bonuses built into the
deals, provided both 21-year-olds have quantifiably better years
than they've had in their first three.
</P>
<P>
   Tuesday's deals leave right wing Anson Carter as the Bruins'
lone restricted free agent still unsigned, and he said this has
little effect on his situation.
</P>
<P>
   ``The circumstances are a little bit different in that they
signed their deals without having arbitration rights,'' said Carter
from Los Angeles. ``The fact that they've signed, I don't think it
changes anything.''
</P>
<P>
   Thornton, who was represented by Mike Barnett, was thrilled and
relieved to get it over with.
</P>
<P>
   ``Finally,'' said Thornton from his family's home in St. Thomas,
Ontario. ``I'm happy. I just wanted to play, and that's the bottom
line. I was kind of sick of sitting out. I just wanted to get it
done and start the season with the guys.
</P>
<P>
   ``(Barnett) told me to hang in there. I knew what we were going
for, he knew I wanted to play, so I think he hurried it up a little
bit. It was quite a surprise. Mike phoned me (Monday night) and
said we were pretty close. Other than that, I thought we were a
long ways away. I wasn't ready at all. I'm ready now.''
</P>
<P>
   Thornton, who was scheduled to fly in Tuesday night, said he's a
bit older and wiser as a result of the process. He said he
understood that being in the first class of entry-level players
under the initial rookie salary cap meant his second contract was
going to be tough sledding.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now I've been through this, I think the rest of it will be a
piece of cake,'' he said. ``We kind of were feeling it out for the
rest of the guys. I think that's why it lasted so long. The guys
coming up, they're definitely going to look at our contracts so
we'll see what happens.''
</P>
<P>
   He hopes to play in one or two exhibition games.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think I've missed a lot, but I don't think I'm up to
that condition of just throw me in right away, because it's a
different pace,'' said Thornton, who had been skating with the
London (Ontario) Knights junior team. ``It might take me a couple
of days.''
</P>
<P>
   Neil Abbott, who represents Samsonov, said the fact that the
sides never really stopped talking helped the process.
</P>
<P>
   ``As testy as it ever got, there were never too many gaps in
communication of some kind and that was positive,'' said Abbott.
``To a certain extent, we also saw what was happening around the
market and it influenced them and influenced me. We both started to
accept a few points the other side had to make, which I think is
important from our standpoint, that's for sure and we got there.
But it was a tough one because of the ages of the players and maybe
the climate in terms of the business.''
</P>
<P>
   Abbott said if there was one word to describe what they had all
gone through, it would be ``arduous.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The earlier you turn professional, the more arduous it is and
the more difficult it is because of the requirements of how long
you have to play before you get things like arbitration,'' said
Abbott. ``It was an intense process. We exchanged a lot of ideas, a
lot of proposals, there was a lot of disagreement, but we kept at
it. We got to a point where I think both sides are pretty
comfortable.''
</P>
<P>
   The fact that Thornton and Samsonov were given identical deals
made a certain amount of sense to Abbott, considering Thornton was
taken at No. 1 overall and Samsonov No. 8 as well as what they've
done in their first three years of the NHL.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're both young players, both drafted the same year, both
play for the team and are both top 10 picks,'' said Abbott.
``Statistically, they're not that far apart depending how you look
at it. Sure, there is an influence there.''
</P>
<P>
   Carter, meanwhile, said he hadn't lost hope.
</P>
<P>
   ``We pretty well believe in the numbers we've been looking
for,'' said Carter. ``Unless there is an offer on the table that
really piques our interest, then it's the status quo. I really
don't think anything has changed. There's still a difference in
philosophy.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've talked a lot in the last week, moreso than in the past.
That's always a good sign but we're no closer to a deal.''

OPPENHEIMER INVESTS IN FOLIO COMPANY 
</HEADLINE>
  (Eds: Substitute brackets for double parenthesis in Folio((fn))

 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The Oppenheimer Funds has made a small investment in a new
company that is creating an alternative to mutual funds.
</P>
<P>
   The new company, PersonaFund, will offer its own version of
folios _ securities that are packaged and sold in batches, or
baskets. Several companies already offer or plan to offer such
products. Perhaps the best known, Folio((fn)), sells customized
stock portfolios and charges customers a flat monthly fee to trade
them.
</P>
<P>
   Though many mutual fund executives question the appeal of
folios, Oppenheimer, the nation's 13th-largest manager of mutual
funds, is not the first prominent mutual fund manager to enter the
business. American Century Investments has invested in Folio((fn)).
</P>
<P>
   Instead of stocks, PersonaFund will offer baskets of
exchange-traded funds, from which customers can choose, based on
their investment goals. The folios of mutual fund-like products
that trade like stocks will carry a 0.5 percent yearly fee on top
of their own fees.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you add them together, it's still well under the fees of an
actively managed mutual fund,'' said Manoj Narang, chief executive
of Tradeworx, a year and a half old financial technology company
that is the majority owner of the venture.
</P>
<P>
   Oppenheimer bought a 15 percent stake in PersonaFund for less
than $5 million and has an option to buy another 15 percent, people
at both companies said. While Oppenheimer will not provide advice
from its equity fund managers, it will offer its fixed-income funds
and commodity investment products for use in the folios, since
exchange-traded funds are not available in those areas.
</P>
<P>
   PersonaFund, which will sell its folios through brokers, expects
to open for business in four to six months.

MICROSOFT READY TO FIELD SERVER OPERATING SYSTEM 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By ALEX PHAM  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ Hey there, big spender. Microsoft Corp. wants
you.
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft, a colossus in the desktop software market, Tuesday
kicked off a major effort to enter the lucrative world of high-end,
big-ticket computing.
</P>
<P>
   While the software giant has locked up the market for software
for personal computers and more powerful ``servers'' capable of
crunching large amounts of data, Microsoft has yet to penetrate the
most powerful echelons of computing.
</P>
<P>
   That market _ currently dominated by Sun Microsystems Inc.,
Hewlett-Packard Corp., Oracle Corp. and IBM _ is critical to
Microsoft, which must reach beyond its core desktop market and win
over users of ultrapowerful servers to keep up its historically
white-hot sales growth.
</P>
<P>
   Steve Ballmer, chief executive of the Redmond, Wash., company,
said his company was ready to enter the field with an arsenal of
software, including a high-end operating system called Windows 2000
Datacenter Server, and a suite of business applications such as
Exchange 2000 Server, a messaging program, and SQL Server 2000, a
database program.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is the broadest product launch in Microsoft's history,''
said Ballmer, who conducted the launch like a two-hour pep rally.
</P>
<P>
   To succeed, however, Microsoft must overcome a common perception
that its software is crash-prone, vulnerable to malicious hackers,
and has difficulty handling large-scale computers, analysts and
engineers say. Reliability, security, and the ability to
accommodate ever-larger computers are the three attributes most
prized by the kinds of customers Microsoft craves _ corporations
that pay top dollar to maintain large databases and complex Web
sites.
</P>
<P>
   Scott McKay, a senior engineer for a Cambridge Internet
start-up, calls it ``bulletproof'' computing. ``One of the things
Microsoft would have to demonstrate is that it can securely operate
under hostile conditions'' 24 hours a day, seven days a week, said
McKay.
</P>
<P>
   Persuading programmers like McKay will be key to Microsoft's
success in this market, said Al Gillen, research manager for system
software at International Data Corp. in Framingham.
</P>
<P>
   At the launch event, Ballmer did his best to do just that.
</P>
<P>
   ``Reliability is the area we've been pushed in the most,'' said
Ballmer. ``That should be completely dispelled by the work we're
talking about today. . . . We're putting a lot of emphasis on
reliability. A lot, a lot, a lot.''
</P>
<P>
   Even if Ballmer gets his message across, analysts believe
Microsoft is unlikely to persuade companies to switch to Windows
from their current systems from Sun, HP, or Linux _ all of which
are flavors of the Unix operating system. One reason is the time
and expense involved in converting existing complex computer
systems, said Gillen, who thinks Microsoft will have better luck
selling its software to new users with nothing yet in place, or to
companies looking to add computing capacity.
</P>
<P>
   ``Will Microsoft start displacing existing high-end Sun servers?
Not likely,'' said Gillen. ``Will they be competitive for new
purchases? You bet.''
</P>
<P>
   Sun, whose Solaris operating system competes with Windows 2000
Datacenter Server, conceded nothing.

   ``We've got what they want,'' said Andy Ingram, vice president

   &QL;  Lieberman Third Senator on Ballot Twice in Last 100 Years
</P>

</P>
<P>
   WASHINGTON, Sept. 26 - If Sen. Joseph I. Lieberman, the
Democratic vice presidential nominee, stays on the Connecticut
Senate ballot, he would be the third U.S. Senator to run for two
offices at the same time in the past hundred years, according to
the Senate Historian's Office.
</P>
<P>
   The first time a senator put his name before the voters twice on
the same ballot was in 1960 when Sen. Lyndon B. Johnson, D-Texas,
ran for vice president with Sen. John F. Kennedy, D-Mass., the
Democratic presidential nominee.
</P>
<P>
   Then, in 1988, Sen. Lloyd Bentsen, D-Texas, ran for vice
president on the Democratic ticket headed by Gov. Michael Dukakis,
D-Mass.
</P>
<P>
   Johnson won both votes, giving up his Senate seat.
</P>
<P>
   Bentsen was re-elected, but the Dukakis ticket fell to then-Vice
President George H. Bush and Sen. Dan Quayle, R-Ind.
</P>
<P>
   The Senate Historian's Office said the practice of holding dual
offices was once common, in the 19th Century, but there are no
Senate records at hand to show who did and who didn't.

   BRITAIN: PEER CHARGED
</P>
<P>
   The millionaire author and peer Jeffrey Archer was charged with
perjury and perverting the course of justice in a case that has
pursued him since the 1980s. The charges result from claims that he
asked a friend to provide a false alibi for him in a libel trial he
won 13 years ago against a London tabloid, which had reported that
he slept with a prostitute and bought her silence. Lord Archer, 60,
had to step down as Conservative candidate for mayor of London last
year when the accusation surfaced. The formal charges came hours
before he was to make his stage debut in the role of a suspected
criminal in a play he wrote called ``The Accused.''

POLICE SEEK SUSPECT IN STABBING OF BASKETEBAL STAR

<P>
   BOSTON _ Police are looking for a local rap artist in the early
Monday stabbing that left Boston Celtics star Paul Pierce
recovering from numerous stab wounds, a police source said.
</P>
<P>
   As investigators Tuesday night sought to question 27-year-old
Michael McNeill _ a rapper with a history of arrests and ties to
the controversial rap group Made Men _ a close friend of Pierce who
helped drive him to the hospital adamantly denied media reports
that the stabbing was a revenge attack.
</P>
<P>
   ``Paul does not know any of these guys, period,'' said Derrick
Battie, speaking publicly for the first time since he and his
brother, Tony Battie, witnessed the stabbing and intervened to stop
it. ``Neither does Tony, neither do I. . . . We've never had a
confrontation, ever, with anybody.''
</P>
<P>
   On Monday, two members of Made Men acknowledged being at the
party at the Buzz Club that Pierce had attended with two close
friends, but denied any involvement in the knifing.
</P>
<P>
   But a police source said the investigation was now focusing on
McNeil, whose ties to Made Men date back at least four years.
</P>
<P>
   Two years ago, McNeill recorded songs with Made Men front-man
Raymond ``Ray Dog'' Scott for the record ``Wiseguys,'' a
collaboration of rappers and former rivals from Boston's infamous,
hard-core gangs.
</P>
<P>
   McNeill recorded the track ``Manhood'' for the album, which
Scott promoted in 1998 as preaching unity and urging youth to
reject the hustle of guns, drugs and turf.
</P>
<P>
   But as recently as July, McNeill was arrested for driving a
stolen car and driving without a license. And in 1996, he and three
other defendants were charged with kidnapping and assault in a
brutal case in which they allegedly pulled in front of a hous in
the city's Roxbury section, dragged a bound and gagged man into an
apartment and held him prisoner until he broke through a window,
bleeding and screaming for help.
</P>
<P>
   Among the others arrested in that incident was Robert Daniels,
whom witnesses then identified as a member of Made Men.
</P>
<P>
   An associate of Made Men, Leroy Peoples, said he knew McNeill,
but that the rapper was not a member of the rap group.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's from the industry,'' Peoples said. ``But he's not one of
Made Men.''
</P>
<P>
   Battie, whose brother, Tony Battie, plays for the Celtics, said
he had spent most of the day Monday at New England Medical Center,
where Pierce was recovering from stab wounds to the neck, face and
back.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's been a long, tedious 48 hours,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Battie said that he, his brother and Pierce often go out and
spend time together, and are careful to steer clear of trouble.
</P>
<P>
   Of Pierce, he said, ``I don't think Paul was a target. I would
not say any guys we hang out with are targets. It's just one of
those ignorant situations where someone gets unruly.''
</P>
<P>
   The Boston Herald reported the attack on Pierce stemmed from a
confrontation Pierce had had the night before outside another
lounge. Other broadcast reports said that the assault was tied to a
dispute over a woman.
</P>
<P>
   While denying that Pierce was deliberately targeted, Battie did
not offer an alternative scenario of what happened to spur an
attack that seemed intensely personal.
</P>
<P>
   As police continued the investigation into the stabbing and the
nightclub where it occurred, Boston Police spokeswoman Mariellen
Burns said the Buzz Club was cited for assault with a dangerous
weapon on their premises and failing to notify police in a proper
manner.
</P>
<P>
   Police sources have said that the club's manager wrapped
makeshift bandages around Pierce's wounds but did not call police.
The sources said the manager later denied knowing about the
stabbing when police interviewed him.
</P>
<P>
   Burns said more citations may be forthcoming pending an
investigation into the troubled nightclub.
</P>
<P>
   The club's manager, Robert LaBerge, said he was not aware of the
citations and had not been contacted by police.
</P>
<P>
   Sources close to Pierce said the top draft pick from Kansas
changed rooms and was up and walking around. Hospital officials
upgraded his condition from fair to good.

GORE OUT OF LUCK FINDING PRE-DEBATE LODGING 
</HEADLINE>

   WASHINGTON _ Al Gore wanted to spend the weekend at Cape Cod,
really he did.
</P>
<P>
   Unfortunately for the vice president, so do a lot of other
people. And they made their reservations first.
</P>
<P>
   Gore was planning to arrive on the Cape Friday night, spending
the next four days preparing for his debate against Republican
nominee George W. Bush.
</P>
<P>
   But when the Democrat's staff started making the arrangements,
it turned out there wasn't enough hotel space to accommodate the
200-250 reporters and staff who travel with the Gore campaign.
</P>
<P>
   ``Um, well, I guess the weather's been pretty good'' on the
Cape, and a lot of folks decided it would be a nice place to spend
a fall weekend, said Gore spokesman Doug Hattaway. The campaign
scoured both Boston and the Cape, and couldn't cobble together
enough rooms, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Gore will definitely spend Tuesday night _ the night of the
debate _ in town. But as for the weekend debate preparation locale,
``we're back to the drawing board,'' Hattaway said.
</P>
<P>
   The debate will include only Gore and Bush, as the bipartisan
commission organizing the event decided Tuesday to exclude all
minor candidates. The ruling means Green Party candidate Ralph
Nader and Reform Party candidate Pat Buchanan will not be allowed
to participate.
</P>
<P>
   The Commission on Presidential Debates had said previously that
the debates would be open only to candidates whose names were on
the ballot in enough states to theoretically win the election, and
who were getting at least 15 percent of voter support in national
opinion polls.
</P>
<P>
   ``Of this group, solely George Bush and Al Gore were found to
have achieved the criteria's requisite level of support in the
selected national public opinion polls,'' the commission said in a
statement.

 &HT;    Beating polio likely with right funding
 &HT;    By M.A.J. McKenna
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW DELHI, India _ Vikas was already wailing, a piercing cry of
fright and exhaustion, when his father carried the limp toddler
into the office of Dr. Bina Ahuja The two had traveled more than
350 miles, by train and sardine-packed bus, to reach the
concrete-walled cubicle at Kalawati Saran Children's Hospital.
Kelosh had carried his son the entire way; for four weeks now, the
boy had been unable to walk.
</P>
<P>
   Switching fluently between Hindi and English, the diminutive
specialist coaxed a medical history from Kelosh. On one day, the
4-year-old could walk normally; on the next, he could no longer
stand up. Now he could sit, if someone propped him in position, but
one arm no longer worked, and his legs were floppy from the hips
down.
</P>
<P>
   A final piece of information made her frown. Vikas had received
eight immunizations against polio, three more than the minimum
necessary to protect a child in the developing world. Yet tests
confirmed he had the disease.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is not uncommon,'' said Ahuja, digging her fists into the
pockets of the white coat covering her sari. ``We are having many
cases of polio who have been immunized.''
</P>
<P>
   This morning at the United Nations in New York City, world
political and public health leaders will gather to commit their
countries and organizations to the last stages of the battle
against polio. The goal is to stop new cases of the virus within
two years, and to maintain that result for three years so that in
2005, the world can be declared polio-free.
</P>
<P>
   Third World roadblocks
</P>
<P>
   The goal is in sight, if not yet within reach. In 1988, when the
World Health Organization launched the global eradication effort,
polio was regularly infecting children in 125 countries. It has
been eliminated from about 100. But in the rest, the campaign faces
significant roadblocks: political unrest, natural disasters, lack
of funding and failures in the network that carries vaccine to
children like Vikas.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is like a marathon,'' said Dr. Jeffrey Koplan, the
director of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, who is
attending the U.N. meeting. ``We've gotten to mile 22. Now's the
time to rally the team _ not to stop and have a picnic at the side
of the road.''
</P>
<P>
   The Atlanta-based CDC is one of four organizations coordinating
the polio effort, along with the WHO, UNICEF and the service
organization Rotary International. Their leaders will speak this
morning: Kofi Annan, secretary-general of the U.N.; Gro Harlem
Brundtland, director-general of the WHO; Carol Bellamy, executive
director of UNICEF; Frank Devlyn, president of Rotary; and Donna
Shalala, secretary of Health and Human Services, who oversees the
CDC.
</P>
<P>
   They will be joined by Ted Turner, whose U.N. Foundation is
distributing $1 billion to international efforts that include
health campaigns, and who is expected to announce a new
fund-raising initiative for polio.
</P>
<P>
   Deadline missed
</P>
<P>
   The summit meeting is billed as the launch of ``the race to
reach the last child'': Every child in the world younger than 6
must be immunized before polio can be considered beaten. Organizers
haven't specified what they are racing against _ but there is clear
concern that attention and funding will lapse before the job is
done.
</P>
<P>
   ``The purpose of this summit is to focus attention both on how
far we have come, and how important it is not to risk losing
everything by letting up,'' said Dr. Stephen Cochi, the chief of
CDC's polio effort. ``There's such a temptation to go on to other
priorities, because polio is disappearing.''
</P>
<P>
   But not fast enough. The campaign has missed one major deadline:
WHO had hoped to eradicate polio by this year. At the end of 1999,
30 countries still showed evidence of polio transmission; in May,
WHO conceded that only 10 of them would eliminate the disease by
December.
</P>
<P>
   Missing the 2000 goal is a minor embarrassment that throws the
faults in the current effort into high relief.
</P>
<P>
   ``Many health initiatives are late on deadline,'' said Dr. Jon
Andrus, a professor of international health at University of
California-San Francisco who has worked in polio for CDC and WHO.
``Usually, it's an indication that not all the factors were taken
into account.''
</P>
<P>
   Poorest fare worst
</P>
<P>
   The factors are formidable. The countries where the disease
still circulates are among the world's poorest and most unstable.
Most lack basic infrastructure: In some areas, the vaccine must be
carried by animal or on foot because there are no roads, and must
be kept cold even when there is no electricity.
</P>
<P>
   Parts of Afghanistan, one of the problem countries, are
snowbound for months every year. Parts of Bangladesh are regularly
inundated by monsoons that trigger chaotic migrations. Large areas
of some African countries such as Angola are in the hands of rebels
who will not give passage to vaccination teams. Heads of state in
some countries have declined to make polio a national priority,
leaving the immunization campaigns vulnerable to political
jockeying.
</P>
<P>
   Even in countries with solid health systems, there are
difficulties. India, which in 1999 had half the remaining known
cases of polio, has developed thorough surveillance systems, a top
priority since polio can be detected only through the paralysis
that strikes one case out of every 200. Yet a recent CDC report
said 40 percent of the surveillance posts in the most problematic
Indian province, Bihar, are empty.
</P>
<P>
   And children who ought to be adequately immunized continue to
develop the disease. The oral vaccine that is used in the
developing world is less effective in tropical countries, possibly
because children are already infected with other bugs that blunt
its efficacy. So more doses of vaccine are needed to protect a
child.
</P>
<P>
   But if local manufacturing has produced a less-potent vaccine _
or if the ``cold chain'' of vaccine transport has been broken, as
happened two years ago in two Indian states _ children remain
vulnerable.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, world attention is turning to funding other health
problems: HIV/AIDS, which so far has killed more than 18 million
people worldwide and infected an additional 34 million;
tuberculosis, which kills almost 2 million people each year; and
malaria, which annually kills more than 1 million and infects up to
300 million.
</P>
<P>
   In contrast, there were only 7,000 proven cases of polio in
1999, though the actual number is probably closer to 20,000. And to
eliminate the disease by 2005 will require $450 million more.
</P>
<P>
   Yet those in the polio campaign argue that the job must be
finished. Unlike other diseases bedeviling the world, it is
theoretically extinguishable: It has no reservoir other than
humans, it is preventable by vaccine and its elimination does not
require trained health care workers, expensive equipment or radical
changes in behavior.
</P>
<P>
   If polio cannot be eradicated, they predict, no other disease is
likely to be.
</P>
<P>
   ``It will be such a black mark if we don't do this,'' Andrus
said. ``If we can't eradicate polio, we will have lost all our
credibility.''

MILOSEVIC TRAILS IN FIRST ROUND OF DISPUTED YUGOSLAV ELECTIONS 
</HEADLINE>
   By STEVEN ERLANGER   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   BELGRADE, Yugoslavia _ The government-controlled Federal
Election Commission announced Tuesday night that President Slobodan
Milosevic was trailing his challenger, Vojislav Kostunica, but
rejected Kostunica's claim to an outright victory.
</P>
<P>
   The commission said the opposition candidate had fallen short of
the 50 percent required for a first round-win and called for a
runoff to take place on Oct. 8.
</P>
<P>
   Opposition leaders immediately called the commission's figures
fraudulent and said they would not take part in a runoff. They said
that Kostunica had won almost 55 percent of the votes.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is an offer that must be rejected,'' Kostunica said in a
statement. ``The victory is obvious, and we will defend it by all
nonviolent means. The people have given their political `no' to
Milosevic and his policies. Our first duty is to carry out that
verdict.''
</P>
<P>
   The state television broke into the main evening news program
with the announcement that Milosevic, with 40.23 percent, had come
in second to Kostunica, with 48.22 percent, with a turnout of about
64.65 percent. Opposition members of the commission said they had
not been involved in the tallying.
</P>
<P>
   The opposition said that by its own figures, gathered from
election monitors in each constituency who had signed the returns
before they had been shipped to Belgrade for final approval by the
Federal Election Commission, Kostunica was beating Milosevic, 54.66
percent to 35.01 percent. The opposition said that the turnout had
been 74 percent, and that its monitors had counted more than 98
percent of the votes.
</P>
<P>
   Accordingly, Kostunica declared that a second round was
unnecessary. ``There is no single reason, not moral or political,
by which we would accept such trampling on the electoral will of
the people,'' he said. But Kostunica promised to avoid ``careless
moves that could raise tensions in society, that could lead to
unforeseeable consequences.''
</P>
<P>
   The opposition has called for rallies in Belgrade and other
cities for Wednesday night to defend Kostunica's apparent victory _
rallies that could prove to be confrontational, depending on the
response of the police.
</P>
<P>
   The risk for Kostunica is that if the popular will proves
insufficiently forceful, the boycott of a second round could allow
Milosevic to claim an unopposed victory and to remain president.
</P>
<P>
   In 1996 thousands of Belgrade citizens marched for three months
to defend the opposition's victory in local elections, which
Milosevic had challenged in the courts, before he relented.
</P>
<P>
   On Tuesday night, Belgrade's squares were largely empty,
although some people were out on their terraces banging pots and
pans, and an independent radio station, Radio Indeks, said its
telephone lines were clogged by angry listeners. About 9 p.m., its
signal was jammed.
</P>
<P>
   On the street, Ljiljana Zivkovic, 50, an accountant, said
simply: ``They can't steal the votes anymore. We'll make them
leave.''
</P>
<P>
   But in the opposition strongholds of Cacak and Novi Sad, large
spontaneous rallies were reported Tuesday night, with 15,000 and
5,000 gathering respectively, to protest the commission
announcement.
</P>
<P>
   In an important message, the leader of the Serbian Orthodox
Church, Patriarch Pavle, met Kostunica on Tuesday and urged
Milosevic ``to accept the electoral will of the people and
contribute to the welfare of the nation and the state.''
</P>
<P>
   The official announcement on state television that Milosevic was
trailing Kostunica was already an extraordinary admission that the
regime's campaign had gone badly wrong. It followed what officials
in the government have described as a furious debate about how to
handle the first electoral defeat Milosevic has ever suffered.
</P>
<P>
   Proposals that Milosevic simply declare outright victory for
himself in the first round were apparently rejected as too
confrontational and risky.
</P>
<P>
   A second round, especially with Milosevic trailing, at least
kept his options open and could be taken by some Serbs as
democratic and nonconfrontational. It will be harder for Kostunica
to claim his victory has been stolen, given what would appear to be
near certainty that he would win a second round.
</P>
<P>
   Most important, the tactic sought to buy time for the regime to
consider its next step, and perhaps to bargain for a secure exit,
especially with some Western governments sending word to Milosevic
that his position is untenable and he must consider how to save
himself from a system that could crumble rapidly.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a big fraud,'' said Zoran Djindjic, leader of the
coalition that backs Kostunica, speaking of the call for a second
round. ``In last two days, we knew that they were preparing
something to get Milosevic into the second round. But we have proof
of our figures, and we will defend the people's vote to the end.''
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, Djindjic urged patience. He said the
opposition would demand to see the commission's figures, and
compare them with their own.
</P>
<P>
   The commission has 28 members, two from each coalition, but with
a majority appointed by the government. Opposition representatives
say they have been locked out of any counting.
</P>
<P>
   This year, the government has already conceded a massive defeat
in local elections _ the opposition will rule nearly 100 towns and
cities in Serbia _ but now Milosevic's own future is at stake, and
for the regime, the issue is an existential one.
</P>
<P>
   While a chilly Belgrade was quiet Tuesday night, with no rally
scheduled, people were angry. Snjezana, a 32-year-old shop
attendant, said: ``I'm not afraid. They can say whatever they want.
But they are defeated _ history. If we have to defend our victory
on the street, we'll do that. We've had enough.''
</P>
<P>
   A lawyer of 35, Branomir Misic, said: ``We were out on the
street so many times. And this time we will be there again. There
is no way out for them.''  &QL;

</P>
<P>
   In the presidential election, Milosevic and Kostunica had three
other competitors _ Tomislav Nikolic of the ultranationalist
Serbian Radical Party, who got 5.1 percent of the vote according to
the election commission; Vojislav Mihailovic of the Serbian Renewal
Movement, who got 2.59 percent; and Miodrag Vidojkovic of the
Affirmative Party, who got 0.8 percent.
</P>
<P>
   People also voted for both houses of the federal parliament.
Although the opposition won more seats than Milosevic's ruling
coalition, he will control both houses and can form a federal
government with no other partners.
</P>
<P>
   He will do so because his allied party won the seats reserved
for Serbia's sister republic, Montenegro, after the election
boycott urged on citizens by Montenegrin President Milo Djukanovic.
Djukanovic broke with Milosevic in 1997, but chose not to contest
these elections as unconstitutional.
</P>
<P>
   In Montenegro itself, fears of a Milosevic move on Djukanovic
were receding. Special police troops remained on alert and were
guarding state buildings dressed in full combat gear and helmets,
but Deputy Prime Minister Dragisa Burzan said in an interview that
he believed that government fears that Milosevic might order the
Yugoslav army to take over government institutions or impose a
state of emergency in the rebellious republic were receding.
</P>
<P>
   `'If he survives he will be very dangerous,'' Burzan said of
Milosevic. ``But now he cannot influence the generals as he could
even yesterday. Some generals will hesitate now. He can make a mess
but nothing like on the scale we expected.''

REVISITING `ALL ABOUT EVE' 
</HEADLINE>
   (For release Sunday, Oct. 1)  
 By MEL GUSSOW   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Fifty years ago this month, the movie ``All About Eve,''
starring Bette Davis as Margo Channing _ a quintessential actress,
both celebrated and temperamental _ opened at the Roxy in New York
and became an instant classic. The film won six Academy Awards,
including two for Joseph L. Mankiewicz, as screenwriter and
director (the same prizes he had won the previous year for ``A
Letter to Three Wives'').
</P>
<P>
   ``All About Eve'' stands as an acerbic satire on ambition and
the egocentricity of those who dominate show business. It is also a
salute to the indomitability of actresses like Bette Davis (and
Margo Channing); to an ensemble cast, and to the wit and
sophistication of Mankiewicz.
</P>
<P>
   In a newly restored 50th-anniversary print, the movie will be
shown for one week, starting Friday at the Film Forum in Manhattan.
</P>
<P>
   The story behind ``All About Eve'' has been told often _ in
books that include my 1971 biography of Daryl F. Zanuck, ``Don't
Say Yes Until I Finish Talking,'' ``More All About Eve'' (1972),
which Mankiewicz wrote in collaboration with Gary Carey, and ``All
About `All About Eve','' by Sam Staggs, which was published earlier
this year. Next in line may be ``More Than You Want to Know About
`All About Eve.'''
</P>
<P>
   In the movie, Margo finds her life invaded by Eve Harrington
(Anne Baxter), a worshipful fan whose ingenuousness barely conceals
her own deep ambition. Eve wants to be Margo, and with the help of
the cynical theater critic Addison DeWitt (George Sanders) she will
do anything to reach her goal. At a party, Margo finally confronts
the challenge. ``Fasten your seat belts,'' she warns her guests.
``It's going to be a bumpy night.'' This is just one of the film's
famous lines from a script filled with imperishable dialogue.
</P>
<P>
   Having talked over the years to Mankiewicz, Davis and Zanuck,
who produced it, I'm convinced that the making of the film was not
``a bumpy night,'' although there were twists and turns, a natural
result of Hollywood during the days of the old studio system and of
the sizeable personalities involved.
</P>
<P>
   The character of Margo started out as Margola Channing, the
protagonist in a short story called ``The Wisdom of Eve,'' written
by Mary Orr and published in May 1946 in Cosmopolitan magazine.
Earlier that year, Orr had heard the true story behind the fiction
while visiting the actress Elisabeth Bergner. Bergner told her
about Martina Lawrence, a young woman who stood outside her stage
door for months during the run of the play ``The Two Carrolls.''
</P>
<P>
   Mankiewicz told me his version: ``They brought the girl inside,
and she became the secretary. The play had closed down, and they
were recasting. When it came time to do a reading, she did the
reading and even Bergner's husband, Paul Czinner, said she was
remarkable. In her memoirs, Bergner says, `Three weeks later I was
at the hairdresser and someone gave me a copy of this Hearst
magazine, and there was the whole story I told Mary Orr.'''
</P>
<P>
   After Orr dramatized the story as a radio play, it came to the
attention of Mankiewicz, and he and Zanuck agreed it would be his
next movie. The title was changed from ``The Wisdom of Eve'' to,
briefly, ``Eve Harrington,'' then ``Best Performance,'' and,
finally, ``All About Eve.''
</P>
<P>
   When he was head of production at Twentieth Century-Fox, Zanuck
referred to the screenwriter on a movie as ``the present writer,''
to differentiate him from all future writers who might be called
upon to replace him or to supplement his work. This was not the
case with Mankiewicz, who in his years at Fox rose to and remained
a writer and director with creative control.
</P>
<P>
   Mankiewicz (who died in 1993) left behind a legacy of films he
made within and sometimes against the studio system. While many of
his peers were making movies according to formula, he became a
maverick insider in Hollywood. By his own measure, his films were
``a continuing comment on the manners and mores of contemporary
society in general and the male-female relationship in
particular.''
</P>
<P>
   In his script for ``All About Eve,'' he took the premise _ the
understudy who tries to steal the life of a star _ and created his
own story, adding and changing characters. On March 7, 1950, Zanuck
finished reading Mankiewicz's script and immediately shot off a
memo:
</P>
<P>
   ``Without any question of a doubt you have done a remarkable
job. The holes that were present in certain sections of the
original treatment have disappeared.'' Then he said he was writing
a more detailed memo but wanted to make it clear that the script
was 50 pages too long. ``By that,'' he said, ``I mean it has the
equivalent of 50 pages of too much story.'' He reminded Mankiewicz
that he, Zanuck, had improved ``A Letter to Three Wives'' by
excising one of the wives (it had been ``A Letter to Four Wives'').
</P>
<P>
   In his follow-up memo, Zanuck said he had tried to edit the
script of ``All About Eve'' as he would ``if I were in the
projection room.'' Many of his suggestions worked their way into
the final script, most of them about speeding up the story. (``I am
not the least bit interested in the details of how Eve went to work
for Margo. I am way ahead of you and so will the audience be.'')
</P>
<P>
   Zanuck also suggested the elimination of a line of dialogue on
Page 32: ``I think the use of my name in a picture I am associated
with will be considered self-aggrandizement. I believe you can cut
it with no loss.'' After Bill Sampson (Gary Merrill), the director
of the play within the movie, says he has to get to Hollywood soon
because Zanuck needs him, Margo Channing snaps, ``Zanuck, Zanuck,
Zanuck! What _ are you two lovers?'' Mankiewicz kept the line in
the movie.

 UNDATED: in the movie. 
<TEXT>
<P>
   When all the many credits are distributed, one should go to
Claudette Colbert for not playing Margo Channing. She had been
signed for the role, but hurt her back and had to withdraw from the
cast. With ``Eve'' about to go into production, Zanuck and
Mankiewicz were desperate to find their star.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier they had considered Marlene Dietrich (Zanuck's choice)
and Gertrude Lawrence (Mankiewicz's choice). But now they turned to
Davis, whose career was at an ebb. She read the script and leaped
at the opportunity.
</P>
<P>
   Years later in an interview with me, Davis freely referred to
herself as ``Colbert's replacement.'' ``Joe told me that 10
directors called him and said he was crazy to work with me, that it
would be suicide. One call said you're going to have the most fun
of your life. I knew that was from Willie Wyler. All the others
were from directors I had to save.''
</P>
<P>
   Mankiewicz remembered all those warnings, including one from the
producer Edmund Goulding, who predicted that Davis would come on
the set, pencil in hand and rewrite the dialogue. To his surprise
and pleasure, he found the opposite was true: ``And not one
syllable is different on the screen than in the screenplay.''
</P>
<P>
   When I told Bette Davis the obvious, that the public identified
her with Margo, she argued strenuously at the differences: ``I'm so
unlike Margo Channing as a person that it isn't even funny. She is
a thorough actress on and off. I forget I'm an actress when I'm not
working. There is an image of me, which is not me _ at all. If you
really are a bitch, you wouldn't play those parts.''
</P>
<P>
   Then, sounding very much like Margo, she said that there were
three actresses, ``who shall remain nameless,'' who never played
such parts: ``They'll play ladies and nothing else until they
die.''
</P>
<P>
   Later, when I asked Mankiewicz what the difference would be if
another actress had played the role, he said: ``That part seems to
have been absolutely written for Bette Davis. People used to ask
me, How could you possibly ask Claudette Colbert to play that part?
Years ago, I asked Claudette to read the line: `Fasten your seat
belts. It's going to be a bumpy night.' She did it and it was
darling.'' In stark contrast, when Davis spoke the lines, he said,
it was ``hoisting storm warnings.''
</P>
<P>
   In two casting choices, Mankiewicz won over Zanuck: Zanuck
wanted Jeanne Crain to play Eve Harrington and Jose Ferrer as
Addison DeWitt; Mankiewicz insisted on Anne Baxter and George
Sanders. He also played a pivotal role in the choice of a sexy
actress to portray Caswell, whom DeWitt identifies as ``a graduate
of the Copacabana School of Dramatic Art.'' The agent Johnny Hyde
asked Mankiewicz to give the part to his protegee Marilyn Monroe,
even though Zanuck had let her go from Twentieth Century Fox.
</P>
<P>
   Mankiewicz said he would hire her, but having won battles with
Zanuck over major roles, he did not want to fight for an actress in
a cameo. Hyde persuaded Zanuck about Monroe, and Mankiewicz gave
his OK on Monroe's presence in the film, which, coming after her
walk-on in ``The Asphalt Jungle,'' jump-started her career.
</P>
<P>
   The movie proved to be a high point for both the director and
Davis. At the same time, it resonated as an expression of
Mankiewicz's own love of the theater. In a different life, he might
have been a playwright. In 1929, at the age of 20, he had been
summoned to Hollywood by his brother Herman, already a successful
screenwriter.
</P>
<P>
   If he had not gone, he said: ``I would have written three or
four good plays and two or three good books. I would have a solid
piece of work which was mine, where today I am at the mercy of
people with cassettes.'' I suggested that if he had written ``All
About Eve'' as a play instead of as a movie, Margo could have been
played by Davis, Colbert, Tallulah Bankhead, Marlene Dietrich and
Gertrude Lawrence _ a long line of actresses. Snapping his fingers,
he seemed tantalized by that possibility, but agreed it was better
to have the definitive performance preserved forever on film.
</P>
<P>
   Throughout his career, Mankiewicz was adamant about ending
movies with ``a zinger,'' to cap a film with one final striking
image. At the end of ``All About Eve,'' a young woman invades Eve
Harrington's apartment. She puts Eve's elegant cape around her
shoulders, holds her Sarah Siddons trophy and stands before a
mirror. As Mankiewicz said, ``She bows and an exponential number of
Eves are seen in the mirror.'' He added, ``The world is full of
Eves.''

FOR REGISTER.COM, HITTING BOTTOM MEANS NOWHERE TO GO BUT UP  
</HEADLINE>
   By ALEX BERENSON  
c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Things have not been working out so well lately for
Register.com.
</P>
<P>
   The company, a New York-based venture that registers Internet
domain names for companies and individuals, sold shares to the
public on March 3, just as the frenzy for Internet companies
peaked. Within weeks, Register stock soared from $24 to $116,
giving the fledging company a market capitalization of $5 billion.
</P>
<P>
   It's been downhill from there. First, Internet fever broke. As
the Nasdaq plunged, Register shares fell to $30 by mid-June, wiping
almost $4 billion off the company's valuation. The shares bounced
around the $30s for about a month, until Register's management
decided to offer an additional 4 million shares to investors.
Making matters worse, the company was selling only 500,000 of the
shares, with the remaining 3.5 million coming from executives and
other shareholders.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, the company released second-quarter results
showing that its share of the market for registering new domain
names had fallen from 18 percent to 13 percent in the second
quarter, with registrations plunging from 923,000 to 710,000.
</P>
<P>
   The culprit: an explosion in the number of companies competing
to register domain names. Sixty-three companies are now accredited
to register names, and 100 more have applied to enter the business,
according to Verisign Global Registry Services, which runs the
servers that look up names. Many of the new competitors have
undercut Register's standard price of $35 to register a name for a
year.
</P>
<P>
   A few months before, Wall Street might have shrugged off the bad
news and lapped up the new shares. But not after April's meltdown.
In essence, investors said that if Register's management did not
want to own its stock, they did not either. In the two weeks after
the announcement of the secondary offering, Register shares lost
almost half their value.
</P>
<P>
   The secondary offering created ``a confidence issue,'' said
Richard D. Forman, Register's chief executive, who filed to sell
more than 800,000 shares. ``People believed that we were prepared
to sell even as the stock price continued to drop.''
</P>
<P>
   Finally, on Aug. 9, the company withdrew the secondary offering.
But the damage had been done. Over the last two months, Register
shares have continued to slide. They closed Tuesday at $6.75, a new
low. At that level, Register's total market valuation is a meager
$297 million.
</P>
<P>
   So why bother with Register? Because at these prices, the
company might be worth another look.
</P>
<P>
   Sure, just because a stock has fallen 94 percent does not mean
it is cheap. Faced with mounting losses and questionable business
plans, many Internet stocks have lost 90 percent or more of their
value in the last few months.
</P>
<P>
   But Register has a couple of things many Internet companies do
not have. Its balance sheet is loaded with cash, about $180 million
at the end of the second quarter. Even more important, it is likely
to turn slightly profitable in the fourth quarter and be solidly
profitable for all of 2001, analysts say.
</P>
<P>
   After losing about 10 cents a share this year, Register is
expected to earn 21 cents a share next year, according to IBES,
which tracks analysts' estimates. As a result, Register can survive
without having to raise new cash. ``They have a business model that
doesn't have debt, and they don't need access to the capital
markets,'' said Todd Weller, an Internet analyst at Legg Mason.
</P>
<P>
   That gives the company a crucial advantage over money-losing
competitors that must overcome investors' current skepticism about
Internet companies to raise cash. And if Register's rivals wither,
the pressure the company faces on prices and market share may ease.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, the market for new domain names, which rose from
500,000 in the third quarter of 1998 to 1.5 million in the third
quarter of 1999 to 5.6 million in the second quarter of this year,
is about to get another lift.
</P>
<P>
   By the end of the year, domain names will be available in
non-English characters, greatly widening the international market
for new names. And by sometime in 2001, the nonprofit body that
supervises the Internet is expected to add between two and six new
``top-level domains,'' like .shopping or .bank, to the current
group, which includes .com, .org and .net.
</P>
<P>
   That could lead to an explosion in the number of names
registered, said Chuck Jones, a Salomon Smith Barney analyst. Most
analysts predict that about 150 million domain names will be
registered over the next several years, but Jones said the new
characters and domains could swell that total to 500 million.
</P>
<P>
   The ultimate impact of the new top-level domains on Register is
hard to quantify. But it will not be negative, said Jordan Rohan,
an analyst at Wit Soundview. ``The company is poised for a rebound
in the fourth quarter as investors begin to speculate about the
impact,'' Rohan said.
</P>
<P>
   And with all that cash in the bank, and profits on the near
horizon, Register looks much better at $6.75 than it did at $116.

c. 2000 Los Angeles Daily News 
<TEXT>
 &QL;
<P>
   Back in 1947, ``Little'' Georgie Benson was 4 and already a
budding r&AMP;b singer the first time he heard his guitar-playing
stepdad plug in and play jazz, Charlie Christian-style.
</P>
<P>
   Five decades later, Benson regularly straddles the pop, r&AMP;b and
jazz charts with a guitar sound that still owes a little something
to Christian, the jazz guitar pioneer.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, none of Benson's considerable success could have come
without his smooth-as-silk vocal delivery. Equally accomplished
guitarists such as Wes Montgomery, Blue Note session giant Grant
Green or even rocker Jeff Beck, for example, never broke through on
Benson's scale largely due to the fact that they don't sing.
</P>
<P>
   Benson was already well on his way to a singing career in his
native Pittsburgh when Green spotted him and advised him to become
a studio guitarist. The dividends were immediate, and Benson was
soon working in organ trios with Jimmy Smith and Brother Jack
McDuff.
</P>
<P>
   ``The thing about those organ groups -- and they were extremely
popular in the clubs and bars at the time -- there was room to
really solo,'' Benson, 57, recalled from his home in New Jersey.
``The band leaders wouldn't tell you what to play. The idea was to
keep a groove going which meant more people were buying drinks. You
learned the 'heads' (the tune's melody); then you just went to
town.''
</P>
<P>
   Benson, who appears Friday at the Greek Theatre with jazz-r&AMP;b
chanteuse Brenda Russell opening, has been seeing a lot of activity
lately.
</P>
<P>
   A new album, ``Absolute Benson'' (GRP), highlighted by a
Latin-tinged remake of Donny Hathaway's ``The Ghetto,'' recently
topped the jazz charts while a two-disc career-spanning anthology
from Rhino/Warner Archives has just hit stores.
</P>
<P>
   ``The George Benson Anthology,'' compiled partly by Benson,
includes 32 vocal and instrumental tracks cut between 1964 and
1998, including the Top 10 hits ``Give Me the Night,'' ``On
Broadway,'' ``This Masquerade'' and ``Turn Your Love Around,'' as
well as signature solo sides like ``Breezin','' ``Love Ballad'' and
a striking cover of the Beatles' ``The Long and Winding Road.''
</P>
<P>
   North Hollywood-based jazz guitarist Phil Upchurch, who played
on Benson's epochal ``Breezin' '' album and tour in the '70s,
recalls watching Benson move from clubs to the arena level as the
record took off.
</P>
<P>
   ``Breezin','' featuring Benson's languid Stevie Wonder-like
vocals -- which he sometimes used to scat along with single-string
solos -- sold more albums than any other jazz record before or
since and won a truckload of Grammys.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was exciting to see him grow from playing in pickup bands
to being a big star,'' Upchurch said. ``And he hasn't changed a
bit. My top favorite guitarists of all time are George and Wes. Wes
played the sweet stuff and George has the fire. You can't outburn
George Benson.''
</P>
<P>
   An incredibly versatile musician, Benson can play in any style
with supreme taste, a rounded tone, terrific speed and always the
urge to swing. Yet his voice has proved to be far more marketable
to the public than his guitar.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think that's understandable -- and I know it always upsets
the critics when I say that,'' Benson said. ``People will always
want to hear songs. Not everyone understands what a great guitar
solo is or where a complicated chord chart comes from or what it
takes to play tastefully. Pop songs will always be around.''
</P>
<P>
   On stage, though, Benson can be counted on to reaffirm his jazz
guitar credentials.
</P>
<P>
   Shadow Hills resident Michael O'Neill, who has held down the
rhythm guitar chair in Benson's touring ensemble since 1981, says
playing with Benson is ``like being paid to go to the highest-level
music university in the world. It's a direct hit of a master.''
</P>
<P>
   Along with cutting his new album, Benson was a visitor to
sessions for organist Jimmy McGriff's recent ``McGriff's House
Party'' disc. The guitarist's back-to-basics funk playing marked a
return to the early days of his 1966 release, ``The George Benson
Cookbook,'' still considered a jazz guitar touchstone.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't play clubs anymore, but I sometimes miss those days,''
Benson said. ``The era of the multinight engagement -- you'd come
into a city and set up somewhere for a week. People would drop by
to jam. I mean, there was a lot of joy in jazz then. It wasn't big
business -- it was about playing.''

CONGRESS SEEKS TO PREVENT GOVERNMENT SHUTDOWN 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By KAREN MASTERSON 
c.2000 Houston Chronicle
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Congress on Tuesday moved toward preventing a
government shutdown and making less expensive medications from
Canada and Mexico available to all U.S. consumers.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, however, Republicans and Democrats moved
further apart on the more difficult task of providing the elderly
with an affordable prescription drug plan, frustrating Houston-area
lawmakers.
</P>
<P>
   In a vote of 415-2, the House passed what is called a continuing
resolution, which would extend funding for federal agencies and
programs to Oct. 6, nearly a week beyond the Oct. 1 start of the
new fiscal year.
</P>
<P>
   As the resolution passed the House _ and as the Senate agreed to
take up the measure this week _ both parties admitted they may need
even more time and that another continuing resolution to Oct. 13
may be necessary.
</P>
<P>
   ``We'll stay as long it takes and we'll pass continuing
resolutions as long it takes,'' Senate Majority Leader Trent Lott,
R-Miss., said of both parties' attempts to complete their
legislative business and go home. ``I hope it's sooner rather than
later.''
</P>
<P>
   Lawmakers, at the very least, must pass 11 unfinished spending
bills that would fund everything from the U.S. Department of the
Interior, which controls federal lands and keeps national parks and
museums open, to the U.S. State Department, which conducts U.S.
foreign policy and runs embassies overseas. So far, only two
spending bills have been signed into law, both for the Department
of Defense.
</P>
<P>
   When lawmakers adjourn and turn full-time to their re-election
campaigns, they may have a prescription drug plan to boast about.
</P>
<P>
   However, it is unlikely to be the hotly contested plan for the
elderly now at the center of partisan bickering on Capitol Hill and
between presidential candidates Al Gore and George W. Bush.
</P>
<P>
   Presently, drug companies sell drugs approved by the Food and
Drug Administration overseas at discounted prices. But U.S. import
laws prevent wholesalers from buying them back to sell to U.S.
consumers at a discount.
</P>
<P>
   Congress and the White House agreed in letters exchanged earlier
this week to support a Senate-passed proposal that would remove the
so-called ``reimportation'' restrictions.
</P>
<P>
   The provision _ currently a part of a U.S. Department of
Agriculture spending bill _ would eliminate the reimportation
restriction and provide $23 million for FDA to make sure the
incoming drugs are safe.
</P>
<P>
   ``The battle's not over,'' Sen. Byron Dorgan, D-N.D., said at a
news conference Tuesday. ``The pharmaceutical industry has deep
pockets and they're going to spend a fortune on defeating this.''
</P>
<P>
   Roughly $112 billion will be spent on prescription medication
this year, according to the U.S. Department of Health and Human
Services. Dorgan said if market competition moderates prices by
just 10 percent, consumers would save $11.2 billion.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Gene Green, D-Houston, has been pushing prescription drug
plans for seniors for years. A September 1999 survey of his
district, conducted by the staff of the House Government Oversight
Committee, found that in some cases, drugs cost three times as much
in Houston as they do in Mexico, and twice as much as they cost in
Canada.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had seniors who paid for their trips to Mexico by getting
prescription drugs for their neighbors,'' he said. A new boarder
restriction, Green said, prevents people from transporting
pharmaceuticals for anyone but themselves.
</P>
<P>
   Green, a member of the Commerce Subcommittee on Health and the
Environment, and Rep. Jim Turner, D-Crockett, planned a news
conference today to push for a prescription drug plan for senior
citizens.
</P>
<P>
   Both of the Houston-area Democrats support a House plan, and a
similar plan proposed by the Gore presidential campaign, that would
expand Medicare health insurance for the elderly to include
prescription drug coverage.
</P>
<P>
   Republicans support a plan to subsidize commercial prescription
drug insurance for senior citizens making under $14,600.
</P>
<P>
   In a letter to President Bill Clinton earlier this week, Lott
and House Speaker J. Dennis Hastert, R-Ill., said ``the fundamental
disagreement over providing broad prescription drug coverage will
lead to inaction this year on this important issue.''
</P>
<P>
   While leaders of both parties said they would continue trying to
work out their differences, neither said they were hopeful.

 &HT;    Hispanic vote not key in battleground states
 &HT;    By Ken Herman
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   The music was loud and Latino. The message was custom-made for
the crowd packed into Miami's Coconut Grove Convention Center for a
GOP rally.
</P>
<P>
   ``We Hispanics have become the most important electoral block in
the country,'' said George P. Bush, the Mexican-American nephew of
the Republican presidential nominee.
</P>
<P>
   But barring large-scale, last-minute population shifts, George
P. is overstating the case in the current presidential race.
</P>
<P>
   After months of speculation about the Hispanic impact on the
race for the White House, the final six weeks of the battle will be
played out in states _ mostly in the Midwest _ where the Hispanic
vote will be miniscule.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a demographic reality,'' said Rodolfo de la Garza, a
University of Texas government professor and vice president of
research for the Tomas Rivera Policy Institute.
</P>
<P>
   Save for New Mexico, which has only five electoral votes, and
Florida, which has 25 electoral votes and an atypical Hispanic
community, the battleground states are among those with the lowest
percentage of voting-age Hispanics.
</P>
<P>
   Seventy-five percent of the nation's growing Hispanic population
is clustered in five states: California, Texas, New York, Florida
and Illinois. Of those, only Illinois offers anything close to the
dynamic once viewed as a crucial factor in the election: the
ability of Republican George W. Bush to move traditionally
Democratic Hispanics into his column.
</P>
<P>
   Polls show California, New York and Texas are not in play as the
campaign moves into its most critical phase. Democrat Al Gore has a
solid lead in New York, and Bush will probably carry his home
state. Although Bush is battling for California, where the
voting-age population is 28 percent Hispanic, surveys indicate he
is a long shot at best.
</P>
<P>
   The race is much closer in Florida, where Bush is counting on
his brother Jeb, Florida's governor, to help deliver the state.
Florida's voting-age population is 15 percent Hispanic, but it is
atypical because of a large Cuban American population with
longstanding ties to the Republican Party and the Bush family.
</P>
<P>
   Matthew Dowd, who studies poll numbers for the Bush campaign,
notes that demographic changes in Florida's Hispanic community have
made it more difficult for a Republican to carry that state. New
immigration patterns have resulted in a major change in Florida's
Hispanic population: Non-Cuban Hispanics now outnumber Cuban
Hispanics.
</P>
<P>
   Nationwide, People with Cuban backgrounds make up only 5 percent
of the nation's 32 million Hispanics, but they vote Republican. A
recent national poll by Hispanictrends.com, which gave Gore a 59
percent to 28 percent overall lead among Hispanics, showed Bush
with a whopping 83 percent to 10 percent lead among Cuban
Americans.
</P>
<P>
   Gore, however, has huge leads among Hispanics of Mexican, Puerto
Rican, Dominican, Central American and South American descent.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Hispanic population is not predominant'' in the
battleground states, said a top Bush adviser, adding, however, that
the nominee will continue to try to lure Hispanic votes to show he
is a different kind of Republican. ``It's something we are going to
continue to communicate and talk about no matter where we are.''
</P>
<P>
   That message is important for people such as Jeremy Gonzalez
Ibraham of Philadelphia, who is trying to help the GOP make inroads
in Pennsylvania's growing, though still relatively small, Hispanic
population.
</P>
<P>
   ``Clearly, the strategy we have here in Pennsylvania looks
beyond Nov. 7,'' he said, acknowledging that the Hispanic vote in
his state is relatively small, though potentially powerful. ``To
have an impact doesn't necessarily require you to have large raw
numbers. The question is how many of those numbers you can motivate
to get to the polls and vote for your candidate.''
</P>
<P>
   Dan Fee, spokesman for the Pennsylvania Democratic Party, said
Hispanics are becoming more important in state politics, but can
only make a difference this year if the presidential race in
Pennsylvania is razor thin.
</P>
<P>
   De la Garza, a student of Hispanic voting trends, says that's
generally the case in the battleground states.
</P>
<P>
   ``You've got to have a very, very tight election for small
groups to influence them,'' he said. ``The Anglos would have to be
divided 49.8-49.8. If the majority population is going in one
direction overwhelmingly Latinos don't make much of a difference.
It's only when the majority is divided can Latinos realistically
hope to influence the outcome.''
</P>
<P>
   But de la Garza believes Hispanics _ through Bush's message _
already have effected the presidential race.
</P>
<P>
   ``Issues of cultural division were killed off when Bush reached
out to Latinos,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The ``different kind of a Republican'' tag Bush has hung on
himself has been a crucial part of his campaign since day one.
Depending on whose numbers you believe, Bush carried one-third to
one-half of the Hispanic vote in Texas in his 1998 re-election
campaign.
</P>
<P>
   Bush has continued that effort in the presidential race,
speaking Spanish on the campaign trail, airing Spanish-language
advertisements and distancing himself from GOP immigration
positions unpopular among Hispanics
</P>
<P>
   Though the message remains important to Bush, the numbers sho
the appeal to Hispanics may not be numerically crucial in the
campaign's closing weeks. The battleground states in which Bush and
Gore are concentrating their time and resources include 10 _ with a
total of 134 of the 270 electoral votes needed for victory. The
Hispanic voting-age population in these states is less than 3
percent.
</P>
<P>
   At the other end of the battleground spectrum are New Mexico,
which, at 38 percent, has the highest proportion of voting-age
Hispanics, Arizona (19 percent) and Florida (15 percent). Those
states offer a total of 38 electoral votes.
</P>
<P>
   Most polling in recent weeks has shown Gore leading Bush among
Hispanics. But new numbers released by New York pollster John Zogby
showed the candidates tied at 44 percent among Hispanics. The poll
was completed last week.
</P>
<P>
   A Reuters/Zogby national poll completed earlier last week gave
Gore a 57 percent to 25 percent edge among Hispanics.
</P>
<P>
   In 1992, the elder George Bush captured only 19 percent of the
Hispanic vote when he was ousted by Democrat Bill Clinton. In 1996,
GOP nominee Bob Dole pulled an anemic 13 percent of the Hispanic
vote.

 &HT;    Drug case is complex affair
 &HT;    By Steve Hummer
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   SYDNEY - Big guys do cry. And when they do, when they drop that
man-mountain act and show their gooey center, it can be more
convincing than a head slap or a hammerlock.
</P>
<P>
   Normally about as soft as slate, C.J. Hunter became a 330-pound
puddle when he began the public portion of his defense against
steroid charges. Those tears ran like a rivulet across a boulder.
</P>
<P>
   The lab has not yet determined whether Hunter's tears tested
positive for sincerity. The USOC will release those results
sometime after the 2004 Athens Olympics.
</P>
<P>
   That one scene, as Hunter double-clutched on his words while
considering the impact on wife Marion Jones, likely will go much
farther in the court of public opinion than all the nanograms of
science the international drug police can muster. We too often
judge with the heart. Look at how one kiss might turn a
presidential race.
</P>
<P>
   Shame on you, you drug-testing bullies. You made C.J. cry.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Ms. Jones is back on the track, attempting a feat
that would have been difficult enough even with a clear head. Now
if she does not win her five Olympic golds it will be because of
the politics of drugs and a hounding press. When all along it could
have been simply because she had taken on too much, the long jump
didn't suit her or the U.S. relay teams were depleted.
</P>
<P>
   On the other hand, if Jones does go for five under these
circumstances, she will cast in stone her status as one of the
greatest single-minded athletes in Olympic history.
</P>
<P>
   Never has so much Olympic drama played out around someone not
even in the Olympics. If only Hunter had married beneath him, none
of this would be a raging issue.
</P>
<P>
   Just in case the teary appeal didn't work, Hunter had Johnnie
Cochran in his corner ready to spring to litigation. C.J. O.J.
Doesn't anyone on his client list go by a full name?
</P>
<P>
   When Hunter proclaimed, ``I don't know what has happened, but I
promise everybody I'm going to find out,'' a person couldn't help
but wonder, too, how O.J.'s search for the real killer is going.
</P>
<P>
   If the urine is unfit, you still must acquit.
</P>
<P>
   Cochran has a long-standing relationship with Hunter, by
marriage. Back when she was 16, Jones was briefly suspended for
missing a mandatory drug test. Her mother sought out Cochran who
successfully brokered her reinstatement when it was all put off to
some mishandled paperwork.
</P>
<P>
   Hunter paints himself as a shot putter too indifferent to even
consider performance-enhancing drugs. An interesting approach, one
that future generations of suspects may keep in mind. Call it the
``Oh I'm just doing this until my application to beauty school gets
accepted'' defense.
</P>
<P>
   ``Track and field is not that important to me, not to the point
that I'd do something like this,'' he said. That must be reassuring
to all the people he beat along the way.
</P>
<P>
   For all the world knew before this, Hunter was the glowering,
protective presence around Jones. Now, suddenly, he's the modern,
sensitive man, wanting nothing more than his wife to be fulfilled
and his children to be happy. The media consultant sitting to his
left must have been pleased.
</P>
<P>
   You thought this Olympic drug business was a confusing mess
before. Get ready to be really turned inside-out. The experts are
lining up on both sides of a case ready to explode beyond
proportion. Here a highly placed member of the International
Amateur Athletic Federation says Hunter once tested out at 2,000
nanograms of nandrolone per milliliter _ 1,000 times the permitted
amount. There a nutritional expert produced by Hunter says it was
all a byproduct of taking an over-the-counter iron supplement.
</P>
<P>
   If there are any obvious innocents to all this, they have yet to
step forward.
</P>
<P>
   Not certain factions of the international athletic community,
which ambushed the Jones home team with this test result at a
critical juncture of the Olympics.
</P>
<P>
   Not the United States Olympic Committee, whose policy of secrecy
naturally leads to charges of a cover-up. Pretending to be clean
and righteous doesn't make it so.
</P>
<P>
   Not Hunter himself. He springs from the dirtiest event of track
and field, so it is difficult to buy the fact he would be careless
with anything he'd ingest. Crying is not a defense. Besides, there
aren't enough tears to wash away the dirt this has thrown on his
wife's moment.

 &HT;    There are tears in softball
 &HT;    By Dave George
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   BLACKTOWN, New South Wales _ There is crying in softball.
</P>
<P>
   Tuesday night's Olympic gold medal game, won by the U.S. on a
dropped fly ball in extra innings, started a flood for both teams.
For the American women, who lost their air of invincibility in this
tournament but not their prize, and for the Japanese, who won every
game but this one, this was as wrenching as any World Series, as
dramatic as any trumped-up movie scene.
</P>
<P>
   ``I fought for this country the best way I can and that is on
the softball field,'' said Lisa Fernandez, who clouded up during
interviews last week when the U.S. was in the midst of a shocking
three-game losing streak and did it again Tuesday when the
four-year mission to repeat as Olympic champions had reached its
successful conclusion.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not content,'' said Japan's Mariko Masubuchi, one of eight
pitchers to make it through this nine-day tournament without
allowing an earned run.
</P>
<P>
   The others were from China and Australia and Italy, along with
Michele Smith, Christa Williams and Lori Harrigan of the U.S. So
evenly matched were these teams that the gold-medal Americans, easy
winners at the original Olympic softball competition four years
ago, stumbled into Sydney's semifinals as the fourth-ranked team
with a mediocre 4-3 record.
</P>
<P>
   Even the medal ceremony was a close call. A driving thunderstorm
blanketed Blacktown Olympic Center just 10 minutes after the U.S.
had closed out a 2-1 comeback victory in eight innings. Do you
throw a tarp over an entire team and direct them to take the medal
stand in a monsoon?
</P>
<P>
   Thankfully the answer was no, but the half-hour delay in hearing
the national anthem was one more reminder to the Americans that
nothing is ever going to come easy in this game again.
</P>
<P>
   ``Since '96, play has excelled in all countries,'' said Dot
Richardson, one of eight double-golden gals who debuted softball as
an Olympic sport at the Atlanta Games. ``It's just excellent
softball.''
</P>
<P>
   Enough to make one ache for Shiori Koseki. She is an office
clerk back home in Japan, not a softball pro. The sole ambition
listed on her Olympic biography sheet is ``To get the victory in
the Sydney Olympics.'' Tuesday night, when Laura Berg whistled a
spinning line drive toward her in left field, Koseki got flattened
by fate instead. Backpedaling and twisting on slippery grass, she
got a glove on the ball but couldn't keep it there. As Koseki
landed on her back, the ball popped out and Jennifer McFalls was on
her way home from second base, shutting the Olympic tournament down
by default.
</P>
<P>
   Watching Koseki sob after the game, wrapped in the embrace of
Japanese teammates at first and then several of the U.S. players,
you knew that way too much guilt was going to haunt her for way too
long. Unfair that she was charged with an error, given the lunging
effort. Unbelievable that the Americans won at all, given the mess
they made of their dominating reputation.
</P>
<P>
   The first meeting with Japan last week during the round-robin
games was an 11-inning loss made worse by four U.S. errors and 20
runners left on base. Thereafter followed a 2-0 loss to China in 14
innings and a 2-1 loss to Australia in 13. Just to make it to the
championship game, the Americans had to beat China and Australia on
the same day.
</P>
<P>
   Even former Palm Beach Community College star Crystl Bustos, who
hit three home runs in the tournament's first two games, ran into a
psychological wall. Tuesday's clincher, played in a 58-degree chill
with light rain falling throughout, featured one hit for the
winners and a comeback that began with Smith taking an 80-mph pitch
in the back for the team.
</P>
<P>
   The whole game turned when the Americans realized that Japan was
stealing catcher Stacey Nuveman's signs to Fernandez. That's how
Lisa's changeup, considered the best softball pitch in the world,
got smoked over the center-field fence for a home run in the fourth
inning. Here again Smith's savvy paid off in discovering the
problem. Four times she's been the MVP of Japan's professional
softball league. She speaks fluent Japanese, and apparently thinks
it, too.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can't tell you how supportive the girls were,'' Fernandez
said. ``They kept telling me, 'Keep fighting, Lisa. Stay with us.
We're gonna get you the runs.' Everyone had the emotion, all the
way down to the end.''
</P>
<P>
   To the end of the game and beyond, actually. Berg, for instance,
immediately called her twin sister, asleep at 3 a.m. in California,
to scream and laugh and describe exactly what a 2000 Olympic gold
medal looks like. Bustos thought about how good it will feel to get
home to California herself, and how sad it will be, too, with the
realization that a favorite grandfather died there during the
Sydney softball tournament. Fernandez took the medal off her neck
and placed it on U.S. coach Ralph Raymond, a quiet man who led the
Raybestos Brakettes women's softball team of Stratford, Conn., for
26 years but never imagined himself on the other side of the world
bringing honor to his country.
</P>
<P>
   Oh, there are tears in softball, all right. A good cry, in this
case, for the resilient Americans and a pillow-soaker for the
devastated Japanese.
</P>
<P>
   A sign that softball, you might say, can be hardball, too.

   While the doping controversy surrounding C.J. Hunter is
unfortunate for the Games in general, and track and field in
particular, a side effect for NBC could be even more interest in
the pursuit of five gold medals by his wife Marion Jones, whose
efforts in the qualifying rounds of the 200 meters and the long
jump will be featured on tonight's prime-time telecast. Australian
heroine Cathy Freeman, fresh off her gold medal in the 400 meters,
is also running in the 200; while Gail Devers' attempt to get that
elusive gold medal in the 100-meter hurdles will be shown as well.
Stone Mountain resident Sharon Crouch is among the challengers to
Devers, who lives in Alpharetta. Two-time Tour de France champion
Lance Armstrong will get some air time, too, as the American
cyclist seeks his first medal in his third Olympics, while Georgian
Teresa Edwards and a host of players from the WNBA will anchor the

 &HT;    Trouble in Tuscaloosa as AD declines DuBose's resignation
 &HT;    By Tony Barnhart
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA - This summer, most Alabama football fans assumed that
Sept. 30 would be a day of celebration. It would be the season's
first game on campus, and the Crimson Tide would be 4-0 and well on
the way to a national championship.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, when South Carolina comes to Tuscaloosa on Saturday,
the dominant moods in Bryant-Denny Stadium will be despair about
the present and uncertainty about the future.
</P>
<P>
   Alabama, which returned 18 starters from the 1999 SEC champions
and was ranked No. 3 in the preseason, has a record of 1-3. In the
lone win, Alabama needed 18 points in the fourth quarter to beat
Vanderbilt 28-10. In two of the losses, Alabama was dominated, by
UCLA 35-24 and by Southern Miss 21-0. The other loss came when
Arkansas drove 80 yards and scored with 64 seconds left to win
28-21 Saturday night in Fayetteville.
</P>
<P>
   Crimson Tide fans, not known for their patience, want to know
why. The vocal ones blame coach Mike DuBose, who survived efforts
to oust him a year ago and went on to be named SEC coach of the
year.
</P>
<P>
   Alabama is 1-1 in the conference and can make another recovery.
If the Tide can win its six remaining conference games and if
Arkansas (3-0, 1-0 SEC) loses twice, Alabama can make it back to
Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
   ``Just because it's not there (for the national title) doesn't
mean you don't have other goals,'' DuBose said. ``There's still the
possibility of winning the conference championship.''
</P>
<P>
   But every day, another story indicates problems in Tuscaloosa.
For example:
</P>
<P>
   After the season-opening beating at UCLA, with 30,000 Crimson
Tide fans in the Rose Bowl, DuBose was perplexed by the team's
performance, and his staff seemed baffled, too.Coaches,
particularly on the offensive staff, were second-guessing each
other in news reports.
</P>
<P>
   Neil Calloway has the title of offensive coordinator, but
quarterbacks coach Charlie Stubbs calls the plays. DuBose also has
heavy input when it comes to personnel matters and the game plan.
One radio report said that Stubbs, whose BYU-style passing offense
conflicts with the physical run-oriented style of Calloway, would
be leaving out of frustration at the end of the season. Both DuBose
and Stubbs denied the report.
</P>
<P>
   Various television analysts, including ESPN's Lee Corso and John
Mackovic, suggested that the Tide's three-headed approach to
offense has caused uncertainty and ineffectiveness.
</P>
<P>
   ``Most of those guys who have all those ideas have been
fired,''DuBose said, bristling. ``So I'm not sure they really have
the expertise to make those statements.''
</P>
<P>
   Tuesday's editions of the Birmingham News and Tuscaloosa News
reported that DuBose offered his resignation, effective at the end
of the season, to athletics director Mal Moore after the loss to
Southern Mississippi on Sept. 16.
</P>
<P>
   DuBose confirmed the conversation with Moore but said it was a
private talk. Several assistants had been in the room, according to
the newspaper report. ``It was an emotional thing after the game,''
Moore said in that account. ``In a dressing room like that, it is
not an official meeting in that context, and I certainly took it
that way.''
</P>
<P>
   But the fans don't understand why a team that was so good a year
ago and lost only four starters can be so bad now. Alabama relied
heavily on the running game against Arkansas and looked more
confident in its approach. Maybe the Crimson Tide found its
identity in the loss, but the fans want to know why it took four
games into the season to figure out what the offense can and cannot
do.
</P>
<P>
   The defense has been struggling with its tackling since the
opener with UCLA, when running back DeShaun Foster gained 187 yards
on 42 carries. On Saturday, with Alabama clinging to a 21-20 lead,
Arkansas drove the length of the field with a third-team tailback
to score the winning touchdown. The fans don't understand why
Alabama, with three nationally ranked recruiting classes in a row,
has only one win in September.
</P>
<P>
   Moore did not accept DuBose's resignation on Sept. 16. But he
said that DuBose, along with other members of the coaching staff,
will be evaluated at the end of the season, as usual. ``I think my
job is to support the team during the season, and we evaluate every
team and every coach at the end of their respective season,'' Moore
said. ``That will be done here. I'm supporting these guys.''
</P>
<P>
   After Alabama won the SEC championship in 1999, DuBose received
a contract extension though the 2004 season. His annual
compensation is just over $500,000. The university would have to
reach a settlement on those four remaining years if it made a
change.
</P>
<P>
   But for now, DuBose will do what he did last September, when it
appeared certain that his days as the head coach at Alabama were
numbered.
</P>
<P>
   ``Press on. Press on. It's the only thing I know to do,'' said
DuBose, who played for Alabama 1972-74. ``I'm accountable. I'm not
trying to sidestep anything.''

<P>
   Before Disney released the R-rated Sylvester Stallone movie
``Judge Dredd,'' about urban anarchy and street war, the studio
tested the film before a focus group that included more than 100
youths ages 13 to 16.
</P>
<P>
   MGM/United Artists tested commercials for ``Disturbing
Behavior,'' an R-rated horror thriller about troublemaking
teen-agers transformed into upstanding citizens, before more than
400 12- to 20-year-olds. A survey reported that they felt the
``standout scene'' was one of a blonde bashing her head into a
mirror.
</P>
<P>
   Columbia Tristar's researchers interviewed 50 children ages 9 to
11 to evaluate concepts for the sequel to ``I Know What You Did
Last Summer,'' a tale of a serial slasher equipped with an outsized
ice hook.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is evidence to indicate that attendance in the original
movie dipped down to the age of 10,'' explained a memorandum from
the National Research Group, the dominant market research
organization for major studios. ``Therefore, it seems to make sense
to interview 10- to 11-year-olds.''
</P>
<P>
   These incidents and others are recorded in confidential
marketing documents submitted by nine movie studios to the
government commission that investigated the marketing of violent
entertainment to children. Those documents show that some of the
biggest companies in Hollywood routinely recruited scores of
teen-agers and children as young as 9 to evaluate story concepts,
commercials, theatrical trailers and rough cuts for R-rated movies.
</P>
<P>
   Tuesday, the movie industry's trade association, the Motion
Picture Association of America, announced steps to restrict its
marketing of R-rated films to under-age children. Among them is a
pledge not to use children under 17 in test screenings unless they
are accompanied by an adult. An R-rated movie requires that anyone
under 17 be accompanied by an adult because of explicit violent or
sexual content. The rating, like all movie ratings, is the
industry's own standard, subject only to its own policing.
</P>
<P>
   Jack Valenti, the MPAA chairman, said a report by the Federal
Trade Commission had prompted studios to take ``a fresh new look at
the way we market films.''
</P>
<P>
   The industry's program is the latest consequence of the FTC's
sharply critical report on marketing practices in the movie, music
and video-game industries. Citing regulations prohibiting it from
releasing trade secrets, the report did not reveal the names of the
entertainment companies involved or the details of the marketing
campaigns.
</P>
<P>
   Those are contained in the supporting documents, which were
obtained by The New York Times.
</P>
<P>
   Eight movie studio executives are scheduled to testify Wednesday
before the Senate Commerce Committee about their policies. At the
first committee hearing, two weeks ago, Valenti conceded that
perhaps marketing people ``stepped over the line'' but argued that
the location of that line was ``ill lit, hazily observed.''
</P>
<P>
   Valenti maintained that ``we are not dealing with Euclid's
geometry where the equations are pristine and explicit.''
</P>
<P>
   When asked about the confidential marketing reports Tuesday,
Valenti said, ``I didn't know it was happening.'' He added that the
``practice of going to 10- and 12-year-olds is really not
acceptable.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   In their own marketing plans submitted to the FTC the major
movie studios offered a window into practices that can begin almost
as soon as a movie is conceived. Preliminary test screenings are
conducted months before films appear in theaters.
</P>
<P>
   Recruiters hunt for moviegoers in the lines outside cinemas or
malls offering free tickets to people who match the age and ethnic
profile set by the studios. And the results ultimately can shape
promotions, advertising and decisions for a movie sequel.
</P>
<P>
   In some of the memorandums describing marketing strategy, movie
studios and video-game makers acknowledged that while they have
publicly identified 18- to 34-year-olds as their primary audience
for restricted movies and games, they needed the support of young
teen-agers. Toy tie-ins to PG-13 movies, which caution that violent
material may be ``inappropriate'' for children under 13, broaden
the promotion of those films to children as young as 4.
</P>
<P>
   The main company that gathers marketing information for major
movie studios is National Research Group of Los Angeles. Joseph
Farrell, the company's co-chairman, said that information is
gathered in a variety of ways, including telephone surveys and test
screenings of movies, commercials and theatrical trailers.
</P>
<P>
   ``All of the specifications that we carry out, including the
methodology involving focus groups, are prescribed by the
studios,'' said Farrell, who noted that no one under 12 is
``approached or interviewed or involved in discussions without a
parent's permission.''
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   For test screenings, younger people are accompanied by parents,
Farrell said. He described the process of gathering information
from focus groups of younger children as unusual.
</P>
<P>
   In its report, the FTC examined 44 R-rated films and 20 violent
PG-13 films distributed by the nine major studios over a four-year
period ending in 1999. Thirty-three of the 44 R-rated films or
advertisements for them were screened for under-age teen-agers and
children as young as 9.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know anything about that,'' Farrell said of that
conclusion.
</P>
<P>
   In the fall-out from the FTC report, Disney announced earlier
this month that it would not show R-rated films from any of its
units to focus groups with participants under 17 and would urge
theaters to more strictly enforce age restrictions.
</P>
<P>
   But marketing plans from the company's units, Touchstone and
Hollywood Pictures, show that the studio has turned to younger
children for market research on R-rated films.
</P>
<P>
   In the case of ``Judge Dredd,'' Hollywood Pictures tested the
1995 film with a broad group that included a subset of 13- to
16-year-olds. The participants were asked to rate everything from
the movie's music and action to the film's ending and its hero,
played by Stallone. Participants also rated every movie scene, from
a robot ripping off a man's arms to a prison plane crash.
</P>
<P>
   Later, the company's researchers tested the movie's five
commercials before 1,800 people, who included participants as young
as 12. And those surveys, along with the earlier movie ratings,
detected a clear pattern of enthusiasm among one age group: young
teen-agers, particularly males.
</P>
<P>
   In 1998, Disney's Touchstone Pictures also turned to younger
viewers to test the appeal of trailers for an R-rated thriller,
``Enemy of the State,'' which starred Will Smith. One focus group
of 300 people included participants ages 12 to 14, according to a
research report. In addition, the company gathered a second group
of 300 African-Americans, which also included participants as young
as 12. The aim of the survey was to test the power of the movie's
trailers. That information would then provide critical insight
about which people were most likely to go to the movie.
</P>
<P>
   Marketing plans for other films show the meticulous efforts made
by major movie studios to gauge the tastes of younger, often
under-age moviegoers.
</P>
<P>
   When Columbia Tristar tested concepts for the 1998 teen slasher
sequel, ``I Still Know What You Did Last Summer,'' it commissioned
research from a sample group of 500 people who had seen the
original movie.
</P>
<P>
   The sample was made up of 500 people 12 to 24. Of those, 100
were 9 to 11. In addition, researchers interviewed a group of 150
Latinos and African-Americans ages 12 to 24, and 50 more ages 9 to
11.
</P>
<P>
   The goal, as outlined in a memorandum from National Research
Group, was plain: ``to determine who are the most intense fans of
the movie by age, gender, ethnicity, et cetera, and what drives
their zeal. The results will help define the primary and secondary
targets and what about the movie most appeals to them. It will also
provide information on the key aspects of the original movie most
liked and guidance for direction of the second movie.''
</P>
<P>
   In 1997, Columbia was even more aggressive about targeting a
younger audience for the futuristic science-fiction thriller ``The
Fifth Element,'' a PG-13 film starring Bruce Willis as a 23rd
century cabdriver turned galactic hero.
</P>
<P>
   The studio sought to advertise the movie on the children's
network Nickelodeon. MTV Networks, which oversees Nickelodeon,
refused to allow an advertisement because it considered the movie
inappropriate for its viewers, who are mostly under 12.
</P>
<P>
   (NOTE LANGUAGE IN FOLLOWING GRAF)
</P>
<P>
   ``There are several gun battles, a couple of fight sequences and
some devastating bomb blasts,'' an MTV executive wrote to
representatives of Columbia. ``Finally the sexual situations are
well removed from Nickelodeon's sphere _ the talk show host
performing cunnilingus on a female singer.''
</P>
<P>
   The studio then unsuccessfully appealed the ban, arguing in part
that the science-fiction genre required a suspension of belief and
that the violence would be suspect to ``the children of today who
are more sophisticated.'' In addition, they noted in a memorandum:
``This film needs the audience that Nickelodeon provides to be
successful.''
</P>
<P>
   The quest for the under-17 market reflects certain realities of
moviegoing habits. Studies from the Motion Picture Association of
America indicate, for example, that the group ages 12 to 17
accounts for 17 percent of movie audiences, a figure
disproportionate to their actual share of the population, which is
10 percent.
</P>
<P>
   When MGM/United Artists was preparing to release its R-rated
film ``Disturbing Behavior'' in 1998, researchers started tracking
the interest and awareness among a sample of 331 10- to
20-year-olds and a broader group of 400 12- to 59-year-olds.
</P>
<P>
   Later, the studio screened two 30-second commercials among 438
moviegoers 12 to 20. In a scene-by-scene rating of the commercials,
viewers evaluated such fleeting moments as a ``needle toward
clamped eye'' and a girl bashing her head into a mirror.
</P>
<P>
   ``The stand-out scenes continue to be the blonde hitting her
head in the mirror,'' the researchers reported, ``Also enjoyed are
scenes of Holmes in confrontation with a strange man being menaced.
All of these factors lead to stronger performance of the
commercials among 15- to 17-year-olds. Those 18 to 24 remain
hesitant about the horror focus of the story.''
</P>
<P>
   A year ago, Universal Studios outlined its preparations to
promote the PG-13 movie ``The Mummy,'' which includes elements of
suggested violence, like a knifing murder in the shadows and the
mummy's theft of the eyeballs and tongue of a hapless victim.
</P>
<P>
   The movie's target audience consisted of two groups: frequent
moviegoers 12 to 34 and male fans of action films 10 to 24. To
reach the ``tweens,'' as the memorandum labeled the younger set,
the company created a plan to advertise on television shows that
attract extremely young viewers, like ``Pokemon,'' ``Power
Rangers'' and ``Spiderman.''
</P>
<P>
   The target market for Universal's ``Mummy'' merchandising
program was even younger: boys 4 to 14. The company developed plans
to distribute 6-inch action figures and 12-inch collector mummies
at Toys R Us, K-Mart and Target.
</P>
<P>
   To cap the marketing blitz, Universal Studios in Florida built a
haunted house maze for Halloween last year that included a mummy
character. The marketing report noted the potential impact:
``250,000 kids expected.''
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps the most blunt and candid appraisal of the youthful
audience for violent entertainment comes in two marketing
memorandums for restricted video games called ``Turok'' and ``Duke
Nukem Zero Hour,'' which features a foul-mouthed alien-annihilator
who, according to promotional material, is notable for ``spitting
more one-liners than Rodney Dangerfield while building the body
count.'' Both carry an ``M'' rating, which bars their sale to
children under 17.
</P>
<P>
   Advertising recommendations for ``Duke'' from GT Interactive
Software's 1998 marketing plan observe that because of the
restricted M rating for the video the target audience is identified
as males 17 to 34. ``The true target is males 9 to 34,'' the report
adds.
</P>
<P>
   A year after the memorandum was prepared, GT Interactive was
acquired by Infogrames Inc., a French company with offices in San
Jose, Calif.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's not the way we approach the marketing of mature
games,'' said Tom Richardson, a spokesman for Infogrames, ``That
doesn't reflect our philosophy. We make every effort to market
mature themes to mature audiences 17 and over.''
</P>
<P>
   In another marketing plan, Acclaim Entertainment, the makers of
the M-rated ``Turok'' series, explains why the primary audience for
the video remains males aged 12 to 17, even though these consumers
cannot buy the material by themselves. The ``Turok'' series has
sold more than 3 million units on the strength of weapons features
like the ``all-powerful Chest-Burster.''
</P>
<P>
   ```Turok' has an M rating, which may discourage parents from
buying the game and hinder clearance of a commercial airing in
shows primarily for children under 12,'' observed the marketing
report. ``However, the younger the audience, the more likely they
are to be influenced by TV advertising. Adults are more likely to
evaluate software purchases based on more extensive research.''

RENO SAYS DR. LEE IS NO HERO 
 

</HEADLINE>
 HO LEE-HNS  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By MICHAEL HEDGES 
c2000 Houston Chronicle
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Attorney General Janet Reno and FBI Director Louis
Freeh admitted to a string of mistakes in the Wen Ho Lee case
Tuesday, while seeking to puncture the image of Lee as a martyr of
selective prosecution and racism.
</P>
<P>
   In testimony to a joint hearing of the Senate Judiciary and
Intelligence committees, Reno said, ``Dr. Lee is no hero. He is not
an absent-minded professor. He is a felon.''
</P>
<P>
   Freeh also refused to back off the depiction of Lee as a serious
threat to U.S. security. ``The Department of Justice and the FBI
stand by each and every one of the 59 counts in the indictment of
Dr. Lee. Each of those counts could be proven in December 1999 and
each of them could be proven today,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Neither Lee nor his attorney, Mark Holscher, could be reached
for comment Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   The testimony by Reno and Freeh did not assuage congressional
critics. Sen. Richard Bryan, D-Nev., said he continued to feel,
``the investigation was very poorly handled.'' And Sen. Richard
Shelby, R-Ala., who chairs the Senate Intelligence Committee,
called the FBI probe, ``a gravely flawed exercise.''
</P>
<P>
   After the open Senate hearing Tuesday, Reno and Freeh testified
at a closed hearing before a House select committee on
intelligence.
</P>
<P>
   Freeh and Reno Tuesday laid out the unclassified portion of
evidence they said proved Lee's guilt.
</P>
<P>
   That included a detailed depiction of the steps involved in
Lee's transferring and copying of classified nuclear weapons data.
</P>
<P>
   But the hearing left major questions unanswered, including what
happened to seven of the 10 tapes Lee created from classified
nuclear secrets and who, if not Lee, leaked to China nuclear
warhead information.
</P>
<P>
   And the Reno and Freeh testimony failed to explain how Lee, who
was identified as a potential security risk as early as 1982, could
have kept his access for many years to what one senator called,
``50 years and hundreds of billions of dollars worth of hard-earned
nuclear knowledge.''
</P>
<P>
   Lee, a former scientist at the top secret Los Alamos laboratory
in New Mexico, pleaded guilty earlier this month to mishandling
classified information, one count from what had originally been a
59-count indictment issued in December.
</P>
<P>
   The 60-year-old Lee had faced life in prison, but was sentenced
to only the nine months already served and was released Sept. 13
after the guilty plea.
</P>
<P>
   Lee had been held in isolation since his indictment. At one
point, Lee was threatened with execution if he failed to cooperate.
He remained shackled for part of his time in jail.
</P>
<P>
   The government's sudden reversal in the Lee case sparked outrage
from supporters and criticism from President Clinton, who made
public comments questioning how Lee could be a ``serious risk one
day'' and be released the next.
</P>
<P>
   The answer, according to Freeh's and Reno's Tuesday testimony,
is that the plea agreement was the government's best chance to
recover still missing tapes made by Lee.
</P>
<P>
   Under the plea agreement, Lee must cooperate with federal
investigators for a year, including aiding efforts to recover
missing computer tapes containing classified information. Lee must
also submit to polygraph tests.
</P>
<P>
   A trial for Lee raised too much risk that nuclear secrets would
be pried loose by his defense attorneys during pretrial discovery.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Department of Justice and the FBI concluded that this
guilty plea, coupled with Lee's agreement to submit to questioning
under oath and to a polygraph, was our best opportunity to protect
the national security,'' said Freeh.
</P>
<P>
   Reno reacted strongly to the suggestion that Lee, a U.S. citizen
born in Taiwan, was a victim of anti-Asian bias. ``Dr. Lee was
investigated and prosecuted based on his actions, not his race,''
Reno said.
</P>
<P>
   The attorney general also sought to deflect a charge that Lee
was abused while held in confinement for nine months. Reno said Lee
was treated like other prisoners in the New Mexico facility where
he was held.
</P>
<P>
   And she produced a memo from a monitor of the Santa Fe County
jail who said in March, when Lee had been held for three months,
Lee claimed the jail staff was treating him ``very well.''
</P>
<P>
   While denying racism and unfair treatment of Lee, Freeh and Reno
admitted to several mistakes during the Lee case, including:
</P>
<P>
   Lead FBI agent Robert Messemer exaggerated evidence at an early
bond hearing for Lee that damaged the credibility of the
prosecution.
</P>
<P>
   The FBI focused on Lee as early as 1996 because he was
identified in a Department of Energy inquiry as a potential leak
candidate without doing its own review to eliminate other suspects.
</P>
<P>
   In March, while trying to wring a confession from Lee, FBI
agents reminded Lee that atomic spies Julius and Ethel Rosenberg
had been electrocuted.
</P>
<P>
   ``Confrontational interviews often call for tough statements,
but that implication was inappropriate,'' Freeh said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   But the most critical failure of federal law enforcement was in
not barring Lee from access to classified information sooner,
Senate critics said.
</P>
<P>
   Lee has been on the FBI radar screen since 1982, when he
``contacted a suspected agent of a foreign power (China) who was
the subject of an ongoing FBI counterintelligence investigation.''
</P>
<P>
   When confronted about that, Lee lied, the FBI said. In 1994, Lee
met with a senior Chinese weapons designer whom he'd met with on
trips overseas, furthering the FBI's belief that he had the
``opportunity, means and motivation'' to compromise nuclear weapons
secrets, according to Freeh.
</P>
<P>
   All that was known before it was discovered that Lee moved and
copied 400,000 pages of what the FBI insisted was ``extremely
sensitive nuclear weapons files.''
</P>
<P>
   At Tuesday's hearing, Reno and Freeh outlined Lee's methods,
which basically consisted of renaming classified files as
unclassified, calling the laboratory's computer help desk for
advice on moving those files and then borrowing a colleague's
computer terminal to download the now unclassified material onto a
tape.
</P>
<P>
   With those simple keyboard strokes, ``Lee created his own
secret, portable, personal trove of this nation's nuclear weapons
secrets,'' said Freeh.
</P>
<P>
   Still unanswered is whether Lee shared that treasure trove of
secrets with the People's Republic of China, according to Tuesday's
testimony.
</P>
<P>
   The FBI only found out moments after Lee agreed to enter a
guilty plea that he had copied the seven tapes still missing,
meaning ``there could be 14 or more'' tapes unaccounted for, Freeh
said. &QL;

   STORRS, Conn. _ Casinos are dotted across America, but there is
only one state where customers can bet legally on college sports
events. When gambling on amateur sporting events was banned by a
1992 federal law, an exemption was given to Nevada.
</P>
<P>
   A bill now pending in Congress would close the Nevada loophole,
stopping all legal betting on college athletics. I stand with my
fellow coaches of National Collegiate Athletic Association Division
I teams in endorsing this legislation.
</P>
<P>
   As coaches from across the country know, student athletes can
encounter a multitude of gambling pressures during a playing
season: People may approach them for inside information or try to
pay them to miss a few shots or to in some way influence the
outcome of a game.
</P>
<P>
   Each season I coach my players on how to handle such situations,
but they shouldn't have to be put in that position. As the amount
of money legally wagered on these kids escalates, so do the
pressures on them _ and on the integrity of college sports.
</P>
<P>
   Nevada officials know this; the state prohibits casino betting
on its own teams even as it provides a home for betting on others.
</P>
<P>
   Yet the leadership of the Republican-controlled Congresss has
stymied efforts to close the Nevada loophole. The Senate bill has
21 co-sponsors and was was adopted unanimously by the Commerce
Committee in April.
</P>
<P>
   Leaders from both parties agree that it would be adopted
overwhelmingly if it were to be considered on the Senate floor. But
numerous attempts by the sponsors, Republican Senators John McCain
of Arizona and Sam Brownback of Kansas, to bring it to a vote have
failed.
</P>
<P>
   In the House, where the bill has 80 co-sponsors and has been
approved by the Judiciary Committee, Republican Lindsey Graham of
South Carolina and Democrat Tim Roemer of Indiana, the main
sponsors, say they are optimistic that a floor vote can be
scheduled over the objections of the leadership.
</P>
<P>
   Why don't the leaders of Congress want this bill on the
calendar? Some, like Tom DeLay of Texas, the House majority whip,
say it's a states' rights issue.
</P>
<P>
   Well, it's true that Nevada doesn't want this legislation. But
what about the rights of other states not to have their sports
programs tainted by Nevada's exemption?
</P>
<P>
   When the NCAA sent a letter to the Nevada Gaming Control Board
asking that the state allow the same protections from gambling for
colleges and universities in other states that it provides to those
at home, it was rebuffed. NCAA schools asked to be allowed to
petition the board to have a particular university removed from the
sports betting boards. The response was no. This issue is clearly
about an exception to federal law that hasn't worked, not states'
rights.
</P>
<P>
   Some opponents of closing the loophole argue that it won't ease
the problem of college sports gambling because curbing legal
gambling only fuels illegal betting. But the evidence is to the
contrary. Many college coaches have said publicly that recent
point-shaving scandals would not have happened if not for the
presence of Nevada's betting.
</P>
<P>
   The gambling industry has made generous contributions to both
parties, and these may be having an effect. The legislation to
close the loophole is being held up even though the National
Gambling Impact Study Commission, a bipartisan group selected by
Congress and the White House, recommended it.
</P>
<P>
   This position has wide support from sports and educational
groups. What unites them is a belief that betting endangers the
future _ and tarnishes the integrity _ of college sports.
</P>

<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Republicans and conservatives around the country
desperately want Rick Lazio to beat Hillary Rodham Clinton in the
New York Senate race.
</P>
<P>
   Yet the Lazio campaign is forcing them to rethink two of their
most cherished dogmas: Republican faith in soft money, the
unrestricted donations to political parties and outside groups that
are used to help campaigns, and conservative aversion to campaign
finance reform.
</P>
<P>
   Hillary Rodham Clinton's reluctant acceptance Saturday of a
soft-money ban was a victory for Lazio. The New York Senate 2000
Committee, an arm of the Democratic senatorial campaign
organization that has been advertising on behalf of Clinton, was
spending more than $1 million a week of soft money on TV ``issue
ads,'' with a lot more to come.
</P>
<P>
   Lazio has raised more hard money (that is, individual
contributions directly to the campaign, which are limited to $1,000
a person) than Clinton. If the agreement to ban soft money more or
less holds, as pressure from the media may ensure, Lazio should
have an advertising advantage in the last month of the campaign.
</P>
<P>
   So much for Republicans' belief that soft money is their friend.
Republicans, of course, as a pro-business party, have raised their
share of soft money. But the Democrats have now caught up and, in
fact, are moving ahead.
</P>
<P>
   Soft-money raising, focused on economic interests and
unconstrained by any legal limit on contributions, is particularly
suited to the Democratic Party of the Bill Clinton era _ a party
that is at once pro-business and pro-government and that is willing
to approach corporate interests with the prospect that government
policies can help or harm their industries. That's why the
committees that aid Democratic candidates for Congress are in their
best position in decades relative to their Republican counterparts
_ despite the Republicans' majorities in Congress.
</P>
<P>
   Most competitive Republican candidates, on the other hand, have
an advantage in $1,000 donations and an even bigger advantage in
smaller contributions. Isn't it in Republicans' interest to revive
the hard money system by increasing individual limits and curbing
the soft money system? Rick Lazio thinks so. And others are coming
around to this view.
</P>
<P>
   Why did Clinton agree to a limit that could hurt her campaign?
Because she thought that not agreeing would harm her even more. She
was probably right.
</P>
<P>
   Conventional wisdom in Washington, especially conservative
conventional wisdom, is that campaign finance reform doesn't matter
as an issue. Conservatives resolutely refuse to learn any lesson
from John McCain's thumping of George W. Bush in New Hampshire,
when he made campaign reform his central theme _ or from McCain's
subsequent defeat after he veered from that message.
</P>
<P>
   But campaign reform turns out to have surprising political
salience. Conservatives should welcome this fact, since they have
no stake in the current system.
</P>
<P>
   The great conservative triumphs of our time came, after all,
before the rise of soft money: Ronald Reagan's near-victory, fueled
by small-dollar, hard-money donations, in his primary challenge of
1976; the conservative gains in the congressional elections of 1978
and 1980; and Reagan's winning presidential campaign of 1980. The
full flowering of the soft money system in 1996 has coincided with
a period of conservative political and policy retreat.
</P>
<P>
   Is it too much to ask our fellow Republicans and conservatives
to rethink their self-defeating defense of the current corrupt
campaign finance system, and shape campaign reform legislation that
would be good for them and for the country?

<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The Census Bureau reported Tuesday that median
household income topped $40,000 for the first time last year and
that the percentage of households living in poverty dropped to the
lowest point in more than two decades. It was the fifth straight
increase in median income, the first time that has happened since
the bureau started keeping track of household incomes since 1967.
</P>
<P>
   In its annual reports on income and poverty, the bureau noted
that median household income rose by 2.7 percent in 1999, to
$40,816, from $39,744 the prior year. It reported that 11.8 percent
of the population lived below the poverty line in 1999, down from
12.7 percent the year before. The poverty rate in 1999 was defined
as a household income of $17,029 for a family of four.
</P>
<P>
   Over the long term, the bureau's reports describe an economy
that is merely returning the country to where it was at the
beginning of the 1990s. But they also present a vivid picture of
sharp gains that occurred last year as the economic recovery
reached further down the income scale. For example:
</P>
<P>
   _ Median income for black ($27,910), Hispanic ($30,735), as well
as non-Hispanic white ($44,366) households reached the highest
levels ever recorded.
</P>
<P>
   _ Households in the bottom fifth of the income scale saw their
household earnings rise by 5.4 percent, the largest of any
quintile.
</P>
<P>
   _ The number of people living in extreme poverty, defined as
having incomes that are less than 50 percent of the official
poverty line, dropped to 4.6 percent of the population, from 5.1
percent.
</P>
<P>
   _ More than 80 percent of the 2.2 million households that moved
above the poverty line in 1999 lived in the inner cities.
</P>
<P>
   _ While seven states _ Arizona, Arkansas, California, New York,
South Dakota, Utah and Virginia _ and the District of Columbia saw
their overall poverty rates decrease, no state saw a statistically
significant rise in poverty.
</P>
<P>
   ``What's so striking about these numbers is that it shows that
the economic progress is not just restricted to Silicon Valley or
to the stock market,'' said Martin Bailey, chairman of President
Clinton's Council of Economic Advisers after reviewing the census
data.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Still, 1999 was only the second year in a row that median income
topped the $38,837 level of 1989.
</P>
<P>
   Released six weeks before the election, the eagerly awaited
report often provides fodder for political campaigns. The Clinton
administration and Vice President Al Gore's campaign immediately
claimed credit for the robust results.
</P>
<P>
   ``This certainly shows that progress has been made over the last
eight years,'' said Douglas Hattaway, a Gore spokesman. ``But the
central question of this campaign is how we build on our prosperity
to make new progress and to benefit everyone, not just a few.''
</P>
<P>
   Gov. George W. Bush of Texas also sought to claim credit for the
economic progress that has been made in his state during the past
few years, pointing out that Texas' two-year average median income
rose 3.5 percent, higher than the 3.1 percent increase for the
country as a whole.
</P>
<P>
   The Bush campaign attributed the growth in income to policies he
pushed as governor, like the ``two biggest tax cuts in Texas
history.''
</P>
<P>
   The average two-year median income did rise faster than the
national rate and more than several states, including Alaska,
Georgia, Kentucky and Louisiana. But Texas' income growth was less
than that of states like Arkansas, Rhode Island and New York, and
the District of Columbia.
</P>
<P>
   There were, however, some downturns in the Census Bureau's
upbeat news. For the second year in a row the earnings gap between
men and women increased. Median income for women who work
full-time, year-round, fell slightly to $26,324 from $26,433, while
median income for men working full time rose to $36,376 from
$36,126.
</P>
<P>
   Median household income is the level at which half the 120
million households in the country bring in more money and half
bring in less. It is considered a more accurate measure than
average household income, which can be skewed by a relatively few
super-wealthy families.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, for the sixth year in a row, the gap between the
rich and the middle class and the poor did not change, and there is
a dispute among economists as to whether it may have increased.
</P>
<P>
   The bureau's calculations of income do not take into
consideration some government benefits like the earned-income tax
credit, which has directed billions of dollars of cash assistance
to poor people who work. Census officials say factoring the tax
credit in would cause a closing of the income gap between the rich
and the poor.
</P>
<P>
   On the other hand, the bureau does not factor in capital gains
earnings on the sale of stocks or property when calculating income
figures. Since the information on income is gathered from telephone
interviews, Census officials say people are generally not asked
about their capital gains income, since most people do not have
that information at their fingertips.
</P>
<P>
   Some economists say including capital gains income would greatly
widen the income gap between the affluent and the poor. They note
that the IRS reports that capital gains income rose to $427 billion
in 1998 from $163 billion in 1993, and that the great bulk of those
earnings went to tax filers with incomes over $200,000.

   ``One begins to worry that inequality has stabilized at a
historically high level,'' said Jared Bernstein, an economist at
the Economic Policy Institute, a liberal research organization. ``I
don't see any good reason in an economy as strong as ours, at this
point in the business cycle, that we don't seem to be nudging
income inequality down.'' &QL;

COLLEGE STUDENTS GRILL GORE ON ABORTION, MUSIC 
 

</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
   ANN ARBOR, Mich. _ They spared him the dreaded underpants
question, but college students Tuesday grilled Democratic
presidential candidate Al Gore on everything from abortion rights
to his music preferences.
</P>
<P>
   In a town hall meeting at the University of Michigan, broadcast
Tuesday night on MTV's ``Choose or Lose'' cable television program,
Gore urged young people to resist disillusionment and vote on Nov.
7. Recent polls indicate that fewer than half of registered voters
under age 25 will do so.
</P>
<P>
   ``Don't let anyone tell you that it doesn't make a difference
and that you cannot change the world,'' Gore told 150 students
selected by MTV and Time magazine to ask questions during the
90-minute taping. ``You can change the world.''
</P>
<P>
   Gore, who also has made recent television visits with talk show
hosts Oprah Winfrey, Jay Leno and David Letterman, watched as the
audience was shown his MTV-produced biography.
</P>
<P>
   Gore laughed as the reporter noted that the vice president was
``into PDA'' (public displays of affection) as a video rolled of
the now-famous big kiss he shared with wife, Tipper, on the stage
of the Democratic National Convention.
</P>
<P>
   But most of the questions Gore fielded were dead serious.
</P>
<P>
   He explained to an anti-abortion woman student why he supports
abortion rights and promised a black male student that he would
make a ban on racial profiling ``the first civil rights act of the
21st century.''
</P>
<P>
   MTV also has invited Republican nominee George W. Bush to
participate in a similar forum. He has so far not accepted.
</P>
<P>
   One student revealed that he was leaning toward voting for Green
Party nominee and consumer activist Ralph Nader. ``How can you
convince me that a vote for Al Gore is a conscientious vote and not
simply a vote for the lesser of two evils?'' he asked.
</P>
<P>
   Gore went to work trying to earn the man's vote, and rattled off
a list of his own causes that are also popular with Nader
followers, including his support for the environment, consumers and
working families, and his push for campaign finance reform.
</P>
<P>
   ``I want you to vote your heart,'' he said, ``but I want to
convince you that I will do the kind of job that will make you
proud of our process and make our country the kind of place that
you want it to be.``
</P>
<P>
   Another student told Gore he was ``mad as hell'' that because he
is gay, he and his life partner won't get to enjoy the same
benefits and rights of marriage that straight couples have. Gore
responded that discrimination against gays and lesbians is
``indefensible,'' and there should be some way of legally
recognizing unions between gay couples.
</P>
<P>
   Gore also said he opposes legalization of medicinal marijuana,
and took the side of musical artists' intellectual property rights
in the debate over free music distribution by such Internet
companies as Napster.
</P>
<P>
   In 1994, a similar MTV forum posed the famous ``boxers or
briefs'' question to President Clinton, which he deigned to answer
(``Usually briefs'') to mixed reviews.
</P>
<P>
   Gore was not subjected to any question that personal, but
students wanted to know what music was on his CD player (Sister
Hazel) and who might perform at his inauguration if he's elected
(Lenny Kravitz). &QL;

BUSH ATTACKS GORE OVER LAGGING STUDENT TEST SCORES 
 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By CLAY ROBISON 
c.2000 Houston Chronicle
<TEXT>
<P>
   REDWOOD CITY, Calif. _ Education reform may be a top priority of
Gov. George W. Bush's presidential campaign, but the Republican
nominee passed the buck on three key educational issues on Tuesday
because, he said, he also believes in local control of public
schools.
</P>
<P>
   For the second day in a row, Bush attacked Democratic rival Al
Gore over lagging student test scores during the Clinton-Gore
administration and vowed to use the White House to help other
states score the educational improvements that Texas has seen
during Bush's tenure as governor.
</P>
<P>
   ``If American students don't lead the world in math and science,
the next generation of Americans may not lead the world,'' Bush
said in an appearance at Sequoia High School in this Silicon Valley
community.
</P>
<P>
   But when three of his first four questioners tried to pin down
the Texas governor on tax vouchers for private schools, teacher pay
and classroom size, he insisted those issues should be decided by
state, not federal, officials.
</P>
<P>
   Bush unsuccessfully tried to convince the Texas Legislature last
year to establish a limited voucher program for students from
low-performing schools.
</P>
<P>
   ``If the state of California wants to do that, the state of
California can,'' he said. ``I believe in local control. I don't
believe in (federal) mandates.''
</P>
<P>
   Asked about teacher pay, he replied, ``You can't pay a good
teacher enough money,'' but added: ``I believe that teacher
salaries are the prerogative of the state governments.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The states have the most responsibility for public education.
Therefore, I would suggest you write your governor and make sure
that he makes public education the No. 1 funding priority in
California, like I made education the No. 1 funding priority in the
state of Texas.``
</P>
<P>
   Bush noted that last year teachers in Texas got a $3,000-a-year
pay raise, an accomplishment for which both the Republican governor
and Democratic legislators have claimed credit.
</P>
<P>
   Gore has proposed raising teacher pay by as much as $5,000 in
some areas and supports $10,000 raises for teachers with special
certification.
</P>
<P>
   Although the federal government provides only about 7 percent of
public education funding, Bush would use part of that money as a
hammer to force schools to improve student performance.
</P>
<P>
   Public schools that are low-performing three years in a row
would lose part of their federal Title I funds for disadvantaged
students. The money, about $1,500 a year, would be given to
parents, who could use it to transfer their children to other
public schools or private or parochial schools. &QL;

U.S. SEEKS MILLIONS IN SUIT AGAINST ADVISERS TO RUSSIA 
</HEADLINE>
  (Eds: Also being filed in `i' category.) 
 By CAREY GOLDBERG   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ Federal prosecutors filed a civil suit Tuesday
contending that two Harvard University advisers who helped mold
Russia's economic reforms in the mid-1990s misused their
government-financed positions in pursuit of personal gain for
themselves and their wives.
</P>
<P>
   The two advisers, Andrei Shleifer, a prize-winning economics
star and tenured Harvard professor, and Jonathan Hay, a former
Harvard legal expert, deny any wrongdoing. Harvard University, too,
rejects the accusation that it failed in its obligation to
supervise the advisers.
</P>
<P>
   Tuesday, the university's general counsel called the request for
damages of up to $120 million from Harvard and the defendants far
out of proportion to any harm possibly done.
</P>
<P>
   The case, which has been under investigation for more than three
years, concerns advisers who worked for the Harvard Institute for
International Development, which spearheaded U.S. efforts to help
Russia make the transition from communism to a market economy in
the 1990s, and received more than $40 million in government grants
to finance its efforts.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. Attorney Donald K. Stern, who announced the suit Tuesday,
said in a statement: ``The United States paid Harvard for impartial
and unbiased economic advice, both in fact and in appearance.
Despite clear prohibitions against investing in Russia, Harvard
advisers abused their positions and attempted to tip the playing
field to their own private financial advantage.''
</P>
<P>
   The main accusations concern the advisers and their wives _
Nancy Zimmerman, Shleifer's wife, and Elizabeth Hebert, who was
then Hay's girlfriend and is now his wife. Both women are financial
professionals and were actively working on investments and funds in
Russia. The four are accused of making prohibited purchases that
include investments of hundreds of thousands of dollars in Russian
companies and the creation of a real estate company. Prosecutors
also accuse the advisers of using the staff and offices financed by
the U.S. Agency for International Development to make private
investments.
</P>
<P>
   Hay's lawyer, David M. Zornow, issued a statement on Hay's
behalf Tuesday, saying: ``Mr. Hay's actions were lawful and proper.
Indeed, at the time Harvard's program was in effect, the highest
levels of the U.S. government recognized that it was enormously
successful.''
</P>
<P>
   In fact, prosecutors are not asserting that the Harvard advice
given the Russians was bad. But, Stern said Tuesday, the situation
was something like an investment counselor who has promised a
client unbiased advice and then pushes shares in a company in which
he owns shares. The client may make money, but a contract has been
broken.
</P>
<P>
   Harvard's general counsel, Anne Taylor, emphasized Tuesday that
the advisers did not simply have a contract from the aid agency;
they were working in cooperation with it, and under its supervision
as well.
</P>
<P>
   In any case, ``all the services the government contracted for
were delivered,'' Taylor said. ``The government's own evaluation of
the project over the years rated it extremely highly.''
</P>
<P>
   Furthermore, Taylor said, the government's complaint against the
advisers said they worked to conceal their private investing,
adding: ``If there's active concealment, it seems to us
unreasonable to expect that we could have caught this. Nobody with
administrative authority knew about this. Nobody.''
</P>
<P>
   Shleifer appears to be taking a different tack in his defense;
his lawyer, Earl H. Nemser, issued a statement Tuesday saying that
Shleifer and his wife were glad the matter was finally going to
court, and that the accusations against them ``are meritless as a
matter in law.''
</P>
<P>
   ``In the main,'' it said, ``the complaint proceeds from the
false premise that Professor Shleifer and his wife were prohibited
from investing in Russia.'' But ``as a consultant to the project,
as opposed to an employee of the project, Professor Shleifer had a
specific consulting contract which did not restrict his investment
activities or those of his wife.''
</P>
<P>
   Though prosecutors are not criticizing the Harvard advice given
Russia, it does seem clear that the accusations, which were first
publicly raised by U.S. officials in 1997, harmed both the image of
U.S. aid in Russia and the reformers whom the Americans were trying
to help.
</P>
<P>
   ``When the accusations were first made, there were Russians who
said, `You see, the Americans said they would come and be a big
help and be selfless, and here they were just like everybody else,
dipping in the pot,''' said Marshall Goldman, associate director of
the Center for Russian Studies at Harvard, who has also challenged
the wisdom of the substantive advice that the Shleifer team gave.
``That has caused deep harm.''
</P>
<P>
   Early this year, Harvard decided to disband the Harvard
Institute for International Development, which had 159 employees
and provided technical assistance around the world, saying it had
strayed too far from the university's central missions of teaching
and research. The Russian case was not a central reason, Harvard
officials say, but was illustrative of problems the institute
raised.
</P>
<P>
   Previous talks about a settlement between Harvard and the
federal government failed, but the prospect for a settlement
remains.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are always amenable to reasonable discourse with the
government,'' Taylor said.

FOR VENEZUELA'S PRESIDENT, OIL PRICING ON A SOAPBOX  

</HEADLINE>
   By LARRY ROHTER 
 
c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   CARACAS, Venezuela _ With oil prices at their highest level in a
decade and the United States and other industrial countries calling
for relief, heads of state and oil ministers from the 11 members of
the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries are to begin a
two-day summit meeting here on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Since the group is more united than in the recent past, and
several of its members, including the host, Venezuela, anticipate
record oil revenue this year, the mood of the gathering promises to
be both celebratory and unbending.
</P>
<P>
   The meeting also offers President Hugo Chavez, who has played an
important role in the tripling of world oil prices over the last 18
months, a chance to step onto the world stage as a critic of the
rich and defender of the poor.
</P>
<P>
   ``OPEC has risen again,'' Chavez exulted in a televised speech
to his country on Monday. He described the price of crude oil,
which last week soared at one point to nearly $38 a barrel before
retreating some, as ``fair and just'' and said that with ``the
equilibrium of the universe hanging in the balance,'' he wanted the
oil producers' group to use its power to create ``a more just
world.''
</P>
<P>
   ``For a century, they took millions of barrels of oil at
giveaway prices,'' Chavez said Sunday on his weekly radio program,
referring to the ``bad habits'' of industrial nations in another
preview of the arguments he is likely to make during the
conference. ``How nice it would be if they also lowered the prices
of things they sell to us, lowered the prices of computers,
medicine, cars and the interest rates on the foreign debt,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   Ali Rodriguez Araque, who is the president of OPEC and
Venezuela's oil minister, said no decision on a production increase
by OPEC would be made during the conference. The cartel's members
account for three-quarters of the world's proven oil reserves and
more than 40 percent of output.
</P>
<P>
   Consumer nations have been calling for such a step, but
Rodriguez said it would not be discussed until an OPEC ministers'
meeting on Nov. 12.
</P>
<P>
   The gathering here begins, though, with cartel members unsure
how to respond to the Clinton administration's decision last week
to release 30 million barrels of crude oil from the U.S. reserve.
</P>
<P>
   Since Thursday, after Vice President Al Gore's call for the
release of oil from the Strategic Petroleum Reserve, prices have
fallen by about $4 a barrel. Tuesday in Washington, Energy
Secretary Bill Richardson said the administration would consider
releasing more oil in 30 days if prices do not stay down.
</P>
<P>
   Oil prices were little changed Tuesday in New York, where the
November delivery price fell 7 cents, to $31.50 a barrel.
</P>
<P>
   Saudi Arabia, OPEC's biggest producer, initially dismissed
Clinton's move as ``an election ploy requested by Al Gore,'' but
upon arrival here Monday, Oil Minister Ali al-Naimi said the
American action ``will stabilize the price of oil.''
</P>
<P>
   Algeria's oil minister, Chakib Khelil, criticized the American
move as ``a very short-term measure that may give the wrong signal
that OPEC doesn't have enough capacity'' to meet market demand.
</P>
<P>
   His Libyan counterpart, Abdullah Salem el-Badri, said the action
by the United States ``comes at the wrong time.''
</P>
<P>
   During the conference, OPEC members are also expected to
increase criticism of the calls made by industrial nations at the
International Monetary Fund talks in Prague over the weekend for
OPEC to contain the price of oil.
</P>
<P>
   OPEC members argue that the main sources of high prices at the
gasoline pump are high demand and exorbitant taxes in industrial
nations.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have done our part'' by increasing production by a total of
3.2 million barrels a day this year, OPEC's general secretary,
Rilwanu Lukman of Nigeria, said at a news conference here Monday.
``If they want to bury their heads in the ground over the heads of
their citizens, that's up to them,'' he added, referring to
European nations that have led the call for lower oil prices as
many of their people have blocked roads and otherwise engaged in
public protest.
</P>
<P>
   For his part, Rodriguez argues that OPEC is already producing 2
million barrels a day more than the world economy needs and that
speculators are benefiting at the expense of consumers. In the last
six months, he said, ``OPEC was supplying the market more than was
required, and that means stocks are building somewhere.''

 CARACUS, Venezuela: building somewhere.'' 
<TEXT>
<P>
   This week's gathering here is only the second in OPEC's 40-year
history intended to bring heads of state of member countries
together, the other having been a 1975 meeting in Algeria. Efforts
to organize similar events have foundered in the past, in 1980
because of war between Iran and Iraq and in 1990 with of Iraq's
invasion of Kuwait.
</P>
<P>
   Venezuela was chosen as the site in part because it holds OPEC's
rotating presidency, but also because OPEC's founding was largely a
Venezuelan initiative. On Sept. 10, 1960, with the price of oil
falling, Venezuela's energy minister at the time, Juan Pablo Perez
Alfonso, persuaded four Mideast nations to join him in ``securing a
steady income to the producing countries.''
</P>
<P>
   Over the years, though, Venezuela, which has the largest
reserves of oil outside the Middle East, earned a reputation in the
cartel as a quota buster, almost always willing to raise production
in an effort to compensate for falling prices. As the price of
crude oil fell below $10 a barrel and OPEC members drifted deeper
into debt, those complaints intensified.
</P>
<P>
   Since taking office in February 1999, Chavez has become one of
the leading hawks within OPEC, creating the possibility of conflict
with more cautious members such as Saudi Arabia. Venezuela produces
2.65 million barrels a day, more than six times its domestic
consumption. Chavez hopes to use the windfall resulting from
expected petroleum revenue of $26 billion this year, up more than
$10 billion over last year, to help finance an ambitious $2.1
billion social works program he announced earlier this month.
</P>
<P>
   ``OPEC has increased its production this year much more than is
necessary,'' he said recently. ``We must never allow ourselves to

<P>
   Hoping to expand OPEC's influence further, the Venezuelan
president has also made it clear that he would like to see new
members enter the group. Early this month he invited Russia to
join, and he has said that the door is also open to Latin American
producers such as Ecuador, Colombia and Mexico.

   ``This meeting isn't only about oil,'' Chavez, a former army
colonel who in 1992 led an unsuccessful coup attempt, said on
Monday. He said it was also necessary for the oil group to take the
lead in discussing issues of ``poverty, inequality in the world,
foreign debt and the autonomy of nations.''

BRUINS SUSPEND GOALTENDER WHO BROKE ANKLE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)

 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ If you think the Bruins have had a rough battle in
terms of signing their free agents, that could pale in comparison
to the fight they're likely to have on their hands with backup
goaltender John Grahame.
</P>
<P>
   Grahame broke an ankle under mysterious circumstances last
Saturday night/Sunday morning, and he has been suspended without
pay for being in violation of Article 5B of his contract.
</P>
<P>
   In general terms, the provision says that if a player can't
fulfill his contract for reasons that have nothing to do with his
job, the club doesn't have to pay him. Grahame could forfeit half
of his $500,000 salary.
</P>
<P>
   The National Hockey League Players Association is expected to
file a grievance on Grahame's behalf, but the Bruins appear to be
within their rights. Article 5B reads: ``If the player in the
judgment of the club's physician is disabled or is not in good
physical condition at the beginning of the season or any subsequent
time during the season so as to render him unfit to play skilled
hockey, it is mutually agreed that the club shall have the right to
suspend the player for such a period of disability or unfitness and
no compensation shall be payable for that period under this
contract.''
</P>
<P>
   NHLPA spokesman Tim Wharnsby said, ``Our lawyers are still
looking into the matter. We don't have all the facts. We've talked
with (Grahame's agent) Don Baizley, but he has yet to get back to
us on the facts of the incident.''
</P>
<P>
   Grahame returned home to Colorado, where he was expected to
undergo surgery that will sideline him three months. Because of the
suspension, Grahame is not insured under the Bruins, but his
medical care is covered under the NHLPA.
</P>
<P>
   This is not a case of apparent willful disregard for the rules,
such as when former Canadiens defenseman Vladimir Malakhov took his
family skiing while he was supposed to be sidelined by a serious
injury or when Red Wings defenseman Uwe Krupp went sled-dog racing
when he was out of the lineup with an injury.
</P>
<P>
   In Grahame's case, the circumstances of what happened late
Saturday night have yet to come to light.
</P>
<P>
   ``We haven't got all the facts yet,'' said Bruins assistant
general manager Mike O'Connell. ``We've got to go by the letters of
the law. We're pretty sure what happened. I don't want to say
anything until I'm 100 percent sure.''
</P>
<P>
   O'Connell said he notified Grahame of the suspension before the
player headed west.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think he was upset,'' said O'Connell. ``I think he was upset
the whole thing happened.''
</P>
<P>
   The Bruins want Grahame back once he is able to play, but it's
clear they are playing hardball. They have used the tools of the
collective bargaining agreement to limit the escalation of player
salaries, and now they're using it to suspend (and therefore not
pay) Grahame.
</P>
<P>
   The club is in the hunt for another goaltender, perhaps Wrentham
native Garth Snow, but O'Connell said they will likely wait until
after Friday's waiver draft to see who is available.

 &HT;    Petit no small race to fans
 &HT;    By Kent Mitchell
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Some of the top factory teams in the world will compete Saturday
in the third Petit Le Mans at Road Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
   The 45-car field will feature teams from Audi, BMW, Panoz, Dodge
Viper, Cadillac and Corvette. The cars will be driven by many of
the same drivers who compete in the world's most famous endurance
race, the 24 Hours of Le Mans.
</P>
<P>
   The Petit, the first event licensed to use the Le Mans name
outside France, has become America's jewel in the crown. About
65,000 fans are expected.
</P>
<P>
   ``Ticket sales are through the roof,'' said Mike Swaine,
executive raceway director at Road Atlanta. ``Through today, we've
sold close to as many tickets in advance as we did totally
before.''
</P>
<P>
   Drivers would not have guessed in June 1998 that the circuit
would have this success. That month was when Don Panoz announced
his grand plan for the 10-hour, 1,000-mile race and the formation
of the new series.
</P>
<P>
   At the time, sports-car racing was in shambles. Drivers and
owners were demoralized, and they were in no mood to believe any
more promises; but they hoped.
</P>
<P>
   ``To be honest, when the concept first came up, I was a bit
dubious,'' said world champion driver Butch Leitzinger of State
College, Pa. ``In the last 10 years, there have been a lot of
investors and buyers come in and talk big and then within a year
leave with tails between their legs.''
</P>
<P>
   Panoz, who owns Road Atlanta and formed the American Le Mans
Series, ignored the naysayers. ``I was chided back then, but the
fans backed me with their feet by marching to the race track,'' he
said. ``I felt strongly if you gave the fans the best cars,
drivers, technology, they would come.''
</P>
<P>
   They came. The race drew approximately 45,000 fans last year.
</P>
<P>
   ``Panoz did everything he said he was going to,'' Leitzinger
said. ``I really do have to give it to him. He's done a good job.
It's not pie-in-the-sky ambition. He just wants sports-car racing
to grow.''
</P>
<P>
   Because of the success of the Panoz venture, Leitzinger is
driving for the Cadillac factory team. Leitzinger said he knew it
would take ``a lot of effort, a lot of work and a lot of money,''
but he did not know that Panoz would move a mountain, literally, to
get the job done.
</P>
<P>
   That mountain is directly across the track from the old paddock
area near the starting line.
</P>
<P>
   Officials had to dig 385,000 square feet from the mountain to
make room for new garage areas, pit access and room for fans to
move.
</P>
<P>
   In a little less than four months, millions of tons were moved
and cement was poured. The new paddock was ready barely in time for
the first Petit.
</P>
<P>
   It was an important face-lift for the 31-year-old, 700-acre
facility. Road Atlanta, hurting from a decade of neglect, was
revitalized and alive.
</P>
<P>
   The drivers were in awe. ``When we came back and saw what had
been done, it was quite a shock,'' Leitzinger said.
</P>
<P>
   Twenty-nine cars competed in October 1998. It was a small field
but a strong start.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is the series the drivers and factory teams take
seriously,'' said Scot Allan McNish, the circuit's top driver in
the Audi R8. The ALMS had an eight-race schedule in 1999, two of
them at Road Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
   This year, there are 12 races, including two in Europe. Next
season, the number of races is up to 15, with additions in Europe
and Asia.

 &HT;    U.S. beats rain delay, South Korea to reach gold medal baseball
game
 &HT;    By Curtis Bunn
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   SYDNEY - After an hour and 55-minute rain delay Tuesday, the
United States completed a come-from-behind victory over South Korea
with a dramatic ninth-inning solo home run by Doug Mientkiewicz to
advance to the gold-medal game against Cuba.
</P>
<P>
   Mientkiewicz, a first baseman in the Minnesota organization, hit
a towering shot over the right-field wall to give the U.S. a 3-2
victory.
</P>
<P>
   The Americans face the imposing Cubans today for the gold medal.
It was more difficult for Team USA to get to the title game than it
was for Cuba, which beat Japan 3-0 Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Both teams go into the title match with one defeat in eight
games. Cuba, which easily defeated the U.S. team last week 6-1,
dropped its first Olympic game ever, to the Netherlands.
</P>
<P>
   Tuesday, America rode the clutch performance of pitcher Roy
Oswalt in a steady downpour and were fortunate to get Korean
sidearm pitcher Tae-Hyon Chong out of the game.
</P>
<P>
   Korea broke through in the third inning against Oswalt. Oswalt
walkedthe leadoff batter and gave up a double to Jin-Man Park,
putting runners at second and third with no outs. Soo-Keun Jung
followed with a sacrifice fly to left, and Byung-Kyu Lee hit a
double to left to drive in the other run.
</P>
<P>
   It was 2-0 Korea, and its contingent made much noise. But Oswalt
settled into a groove and kept the Americans close. After the third
inning, he retired 15 of 16 batters going into the ninth.
</P>
<P>
   The United States scored its first run in the fourth inning:
Brad Wilkerson led off with a double to the right-field corner. He
was on third with two outs when John Cotton lined a double to
left-center field to drive him in.
</P>
<P>
   But the United States trouble with Chong continued. And it
seemed a break that he was taken out of the game with one out and a
runner on first in the seventh inning for lefthander Jin-Woo Song.
</P>
<P>
   Song gave up a single to right to Mientkiewicz, moving Mike
Kinkade to third. Kinkade was driven home on a sacrifice fly by
catcher Marcus Jensen to tie the game at 2-2.
</P>
<P>
   Because of rain, the players were pulled off the field in the
eighth inning with the U.S. at bat, a runner on third, and one out.
When play resumed, the Americans loaded the bases with one out but
failed to get a run across.
</P>
<P>
   But no worries, as they say here. Mientkiewicz came through.
</P>
<P>
   Cuba 3, Japan 0
</P>
<P>
   New tournament format, same result. Orestes Kindelan drives in
runs and Cuba plays for the baseball gold.
</P>
<P>
   Kindelan, the cleanup hitter on Cuba's two gold medal teams,
drove in three runs with a pair of singles for a victory over Japan
in the semifinals.
</P>
<P>
   Wearing its all-red uniforms, the Big Red Machine of Olympic
baseball advanced to its third consecutive title game.
</P>
<P>
   International baseball leveled the field by switching from metal
to wood bats and allowing professionals in the Olympic tournament
for the first time. Cuba had its 21-game winning streak snapped and
had two more close calls _ a pair of one-run wins _ during the
preliminaries.
</P>
<P>
   A team featuring 13 gold medal players was at its best when the
gold was on the line.
</P>
<P>
   ``Probably they have better concentration and their pitching is
probably better than ours,'' Japan manager Kozo Ohtagaki said.
</P>
<P>
   Japan, which sent eight top players from its major leagues to
the Olympics, got outhit, outpitched and _ during the game's
turning moment _ outcoached.
</P>
<P>
   Jose Ariel Contreras, Cuba's top pitcher, held a lineup
featuring four Japanese major leaguers to six hits while striking
out nine. Contreras, who mixes a 90 mph fastball with a nasty
breaking ball, allowed only four balls out of the infield in the
first six innings.
</P>
<P>
   ``We think Japan's hitters were very good, but we have a saying
in baseball: good pitching stops good hitting,'' Cuba manager
Servio Borges said.
</P>
<P>
   The game was delayed by rain for 68 minutes in the first inning.
</P>
<P>
   Japan, which lost the gold medal game to Cuba in 1996, chose not
to use top starter Daisuke Matsuzaka, who had only two days of rest
after his nine-inning start against South Korea.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, it went with Tomohiro Kuroki, who took Hideki Irabu's
place as the top starter for the Chiba Lotte Marines three years
ago. Kuroki lost because he couldn't handle Kindelan.
</P>
<P>
   Kindelan's line-drive single to left drove in a run for a 1-0
lead in the fourth. A strategic mistake gave Kindelan a chance to
break the game open in the sixth.
</P>
<P>
   Luis Ulacia reached on an infield single and took second on
Yasser Gomez's single. Kindelan came up with two outs, and both
runners advanced on Kuroki's first-pitch wild pitch.
</P>
<P>
   Even though first base now was open and Cuba's top run-producer
was at bat, the Japanese chose to pitch to him. The 36-year-old
power hitter lined the next pitch to left with a resounding
``Whack!'' for a two-run single, spinning and pumping his arm after
he rounded first.
</P>
<P>
   The Japanese knew first-hand that Kindelan was dangerous _ he
hit a three-run homer and drove in four runs Sunday in Cuba's 6-2
preliminary-round win over Japan.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was prepared for him,'' Kuroki said. ``I got the ball up and
he got a hit. He's the best in the world, so it's not easy.''

PERU CLOSING BRIBERY CASE OF TOP AIDE NOW AN EXILE 
</HEADLINE>
   By DAVID GONZALEZ   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   PANAMA CITY, Panama _ As Panamanians denounced the arrival of
Peru's disgraced intelligence chief to seek asylum, a prosecutor
announced in Peru on Tuesday that she was closing the bribery case
against him.
</P>
<P>
   The intelligence chief, Vladimiro Montesinos, was seen on
videotape apparently handing $15,000 to an opposition member of
Congress, presumably to win his support. News reports from Lima
said the prosecutor's decision, subject to review by superiors, was
made on the grounds that there was no official misconduct because
the congressman had not yet been sworn into office.
</P>
<P>
   Montesinos, who had been a close adviser to President Alberto
Fujimori, arrived here early Sunday and has been given a 90-day
tourist visa as officials review his asylum request. He is said to
be staying in the home of the Peruvian consul.
</P>
<P>
   It is unclear how the prosecutor's decision will affect his
asylum claim. It was not unexpected among political experts in
Lima, who had said Montesinos is the master of too many secrets
that touch Peru's highest levels of political and military power.
Many opposition politicians, who had accused him of murder, torture
and human rights violations, had made his arrest and trial a
nonnegotiable step toward any dialogue on Fujimori's call for
elections next year, a contest in which he will apparently not run.
</P>
<P>
   ``This will only create more of a crisis,'' said Fernando
Llovera, a spokesman for Alejandro Toledo, who made a strong
showing against Fujimori in the first round of the recent
presidential election, before contending that the vote was fixed
and dropping out of the race. ``There are now several groups who
will no longer take part in any dialogue.''
</P>
<P>
   Several opposition legislators arrived here on Monday to ask
President Mireya Moscoso to deny asylum on the grounds that
Montesinos was fleeing criminal judgment, not political
persecution.
</P>
<P>
   Panamanian human rights groups held a modest protest Tuesday on
the same street where in 1979 they denounced an asylum request by
the deposed shah of Iran. The demonstrators said they wanted to
show their opposition to Montesinos' presence and their country's
reputation as a haven for political pariahs.
</P>
<P>
   The government Tuesday expelled seven Peruvians who arrived here
soon after Montesinos, including high-ranking military officers who
are his allies.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Over the years, Panama has been the home in exile to, among
others, the shah, Gen. Raoul Cedras of Haiti and a former
Guatemalan president, Jorge Serrano Elias.
</P>
<P>
   ``The feeling I have is the same as 21 years ago, that of
indignation and impotence,'' said Miguel Antonio Bernal, a
political expert who said police nearly beat him to death in the
protests against the shah. ``Once again, Panama has been used as a
garbage dump and latrine for this type of rat. The truth is that
Panama is a business, not a country. These people come here with
money to do business.''
</P>
<P>
   Foreign Minister Jose Miguel Aleman said his office was
reviewing the asylum request, which he said was political because
of Montesinos' role as an adviser and intelligence chief. Aleman
acknowledged that the decision to admit Montesinos was made only
after U.S. officials and numerous Latin American presidents had
called Moscoso to warn her that it was the only way to avoid a
bloody coup in Peru.
</P>
<P>
   ``This was a sacrifice by the Panamanian people to help the
Peruvian people attain an open democracy,'' Aleman said. ``So it
fell to us to receive Montesinos. We are a political party that was
itself persecuted by the army. It was hard for us to make this
decision. But we did it for a brother country.''
</P>
<P>
   Ricardo Arias Calderon, a vice president in the '90s, said other
countries had more resources and room for Montesinos. ``Why haven't
the Latin American presidents explained why they were so eager for
Panama to accept him?'' he asked. ``We no longer wish to be the
little country where they send dictators.''
</P>
<P>
   Some political experts said that Panama might have been hoping
to get off an American blacklist for not having done enough to
fight money laundering. ``This was a matter of hemispheric
cooperation to promote democracy in keeping with international
accords,'' Aleman said. ``I hope that is valued in some way. But
there was no quid pro quo.''
</P>
<P>
   Panama's sometimes troubling role as a haven may bring unwanted
costs, said Robert A. Pastor, a political scientist at Emory
University and a former member of the National Security Council.
</P>
<P>
   ``Panama has made its own democratic transition, and it is
moving to consolidate the rule of law,'' Pastor said. ``So to
excuse somebody who may have committed crimes in another country
does not do much to consolidate the rule of law in a hemispheric
context.''

DUCKS PICK UP SIZE WITH NAZAROV
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By FRANK WELCH  
 c.2000 San Gabriel Valley Tribune  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ANAHEIM, Calif. _ In an effort to bolster their size up front,
the Anaheim Mighty Ducks acquired occasionally feisty right wing
Andrei Nazarov from the Calgary Flames on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   The Ducks also will receive a second-round draft pick in 2001.
In exchange, Calgary gets the rights to 20-year-old promising
defenseman Jordan Leopold. Leopold, a junior at the University of
Minnesota, was Anaheim's second-round choice in 1999. He was the
44th overall selection in that draft.
</P>
<P>
   The trade for the 6-foot-5, 230-pound Nazarov figures to benefit
Anaheim's second, but more likely, its third line. The team was
able to part with the developing Leopold because it feels fairly
secure with its number of NHL-ready young defensemen.
</P>
<P>
   ``He (Nazarov) is a big and aggressive guy who has an edge,''
said Anaheim general manager Pierre Gauthier. ``We said we wanted
to be bigger. He's had his ups and downs, but we're getting him at
the right age.''
</P>
<P>
   The 26-year-old forward set career bests last season in games
played (76), assists (22) and points (32) in his seventh NHL
season.
</P>
<P>
   Nazarov, a native of Russia, is remembered among local fans,
perhaps, for his stick-swinging incident with the Kings' Matt
Johnson a few years ago when Nazarov was a member of the San Jose
Sharks. But Nazarov, who totaled 22 penalty minutes during the
1996-97 season, cut that total to 78 minutes last season.
</P>
<P>
   ``We think he is going to help us immensely,'' Ducks coach Craig
Hartsburg said. ``We needed to add size and grit and this guy can
play on one of the top three lines. He's still at an age where we
think he can get better and better.''
</P>
<P>
   The Ducks roster, with the addition of Nazarov, is now at 29
players (three goalies, nine defensemen and 17 forwards). Anaheim
might reassign as many as six players before the regular-season
opener on Oct. 6, against Minnesota.
</P>
<P>
   Anaheim sent defensemen Dean Malkoc, Chris O'Sullivan, and Peter
Podhradsky, right wing Maxim Balmochnykh, and goalie Gregg Naumenko
to Cincinnati of the American Hockey League during its second round
of roster cuts Monday.

<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Attorney General Janet Reno and FBI Director Louis
Freeh defended their handling of the Wen Ho Lee case on Tuesday,
asserting during a Senate hearing that Lee had committed a serious
crime when he removed what they called a portable library of atomic
secrets from the weapons lab in Los Alamos, New Mexico.
</P>
<P>
   The two officials said they remained convinced that had Lee's
case gone to trial federal prosecutors would have prevailed on each
of the 59 counts of the indictment against him. But they agreed to
a plea bargain, they said, based on a number of factors,
principally that the government was the victim of ``graymail'', a
defense strategy that would have forced prosecutors to reveal
``extremely sensitive'' nuclear secrets if they brought Lee to
trial. They said that Lee disclosed shortly before the plea bargain
that he had not only downloaded the information onto computer
tapes, but had made copies of the tapes _ a disclosure that Reno
and Freeh said they regarded as ``frightening'' because it meant
``that at least seven and as many as fourteen or more tapes
containing vast amounts of our nation's nuclear secrets remain
unaccounted for.''
</P>
<P>
   Reno and Freeh admitted at the hearing that the government had
made mistakes in the investigation, but neither expressed regret
nor doubts about the case, which ended two weeks ago when Lee
pleaded guilty to a single felony charge of mishandling classified
nuclear weapons data. He was freed after nine months behind bars.
</P>
<P>
   In an unusual joint statement that was written at the FBI, Reno
and Freeh presented what was, in effect, their most complete and
detailed rebuttal to date in response to complaints from the
federal district judge in the case, James A. Parker, and President
Clinton about whether the government had treated Lee unfairly.
</P>
<P>
   At the joint session of the Senate Judiciary and Intelligence
committees, none of the senators disputed the importance of the
information that Lee downloaded nor did they question the
seriousness of the crime to which he pleaded guilty.
</P>
<P>
   But the debate over the information that Lee was accused of
placing at risk continued on Tuesday outside the hearing room when
a former top government nuclear weapons designer who testified in
Lee's defense only last month said that his remarks had been
misinterpreted.
</P>
<P>
   In a detention hearing for Lee, the designer, John L. Richter,
said that 99 percent of the data that Lee downloaded was
unclassified.
</P>
<P>
   But on Tuesday, Richter, one of several scientific experts who
testified that the downloaded material was widely known, said in an
interview that he meant his comments to apply only to the software
and physics that underlie the computer codes that Lee downloaded.
</P>
<P>
   Richter said his comments did not apply to other data that Lee
removed, including information about the dimensions of weapons and
about the physical properties of bomb materials.
</P>
<P>
   Still, lawmakers in both parties assailed Reno and Freeh for
what they characterized as mismangement of the case, missed
opportunities in the investigation and for their insistence on
keeping Lee in solitary confinement _ and sometimes shackled _ in
the months before the plea bargain.
</P>
<P>
   Richard H. Bryan, D-Nev., was sharply critical of the
government. ``This is a case in which there is very little, if any,
good news to tell and plenty of blame to go around,'' he said.
``The FBI, the Energy Department, the Justice Department all share
the responsibility for the poor handling of this matter from the
beginning, dating back to the early 1980s.''
</P>
<P>
   The complaints followed criticism from Parker, who presided over
the Lee case and called it a national embarrassment and from
Clinton, who said last week that he was quite troubled by the
government's insistence on pretrial detention.
</P>
<P>
   Some Republicans expressed skepticism about Clinton's comments.
Richard C. Shelby, R-Ala., chairman of the intelligence panel said,
``The President's statements criticizing the conduct of the
presecution, as if it was conducted by an entity beyond his
control, was bizarre to say the least. The President knew exactly
what was going on.''
</P>
<P>
   Reno and Freeh disputed the conclusions of some senior nuclear
weapons experts who have accused the government of exaggerating the
case against Lee because, they say, the information that Lee copied
onto computer tapes was known throughout the rarified circles of
nuclear weapons research.
</P>
<P>
   ``Dr. Lee created his own secret portable, personal electronic
library of this nation's nuclear secrets,'' Reno and Freeh said in
their joint statement. ``At the very least in doing so, he placed
these secrets at extraordinary risk.''
</P>
<P>
   The two officials said that the material that Lee downloaded
onto 10 computer tapes contained the ``electronic blueprints of the
exact dimensions and geometry of this nation's nuclear weapons.''
</P>
<P>
   The data, they said, represented the ``complete nuclear weapons
design capability of Los Alamos at the time _ approximately 50
years of nuclear weapons development, at the expense of hundreds of
billions of dollars.''
</P>
<P>
   Reno and Freeh sought to portray Lee as a scientist who, for
still unexplained reasons, downloaded through a series of computer
systems a vast amount of data that was unrelated to his work. When
he fell under suspicion, they said, he tried to conceal what he had
done by deleting files from the lab's computers.
</P>
<P>
   ``Dr. Lee is no hero,'' Reno said. ``He is not an absent-minded
professor. He is a felon. He committed a very serious calculated
crime and he pled guilty to it.'' Reno said that she would
elaborate on her remarks in a closed session, which Shelby said
would be scheduled for a later date.
</P>
<P>
   After the hearing, Lee's lawyers issued a statement in his
behalf: ``Nothwithstanding the egregious pretrial conditions that
were imposed on him, he still still believes that our system of
justice will prevail and he remains fully committed to honoring his
obligations under the plea agreement with the government.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS) &QL; 
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   (MORE) &QL; 
</P>
<P>
   Freeh, who read parts of the statement, said said that when Lee
realized he was the subject of a criminal investigation, he took
several steps that heightened suspicion.
</P>
<P>
   He removed classification markings from documents and repeatedly
tried to enter secure areas of the lab after his security clearance
was revoked to engage in what the officials said was an effort to
conceal his misuse of Los Alamos computers.
</P>
<P>
   ``In order to achieve his ends, Dr. Lee had to override default
mechanisms that were designed to prevent any accidental or
inadvertent movement of those files,'' the statment said. ``His
downloading process consumed nearly 40 hours over 70 different
days.''
</P>
<P>
   Richter's comments came after T.J. Glauthier, the deputy Energy
Secretary, said at the hearing that the scientist's assertion in
court that 99 percent of the data the former Los Alamos scientist
had downloaded was unclassified was wrong.
</P>
<P>
   ``That statement is not correct when applied to the totality of
these files,'' Glauthier said of Richter's characterization of the
computer data.
</P>
<P>
   While physics and mathematical aspects of Lee's downloaded data
do appear in the open literature, he added, ``the way they are
assembled along with classified physical databases and specific
weapons configurations, which are also on the tapes, is highly
classified,'' Glauthier said.
</P>
<P>
   The tapes, he conceded, ``are not a complete recipe for
designing and building a nuclear bomb.'' But the data ``represent
the design know-how and physics information developed by our
nuclear labs over a period of 50 years and over 1,000 nuclear
tests.''

HOUSE REPUBLICAN LEADERS BACK DRUG RE-IMPORT BILL 
</HEADLINE>
   By LIZETTE ALVAREZ and ROBERT PEAR   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ A proposal to allow imports of low-priced
prescription drugs won support from House Republican leaders on
Tuesday, making it all but certain President Clinton will sign it
into law.
</P>
<P>
   Although the pharmaceutical industry has lobbied furiously
against the measure, the House Republican leaders announced that
they would approve the Senate-passed version of the bill, which
Clinton also supports. Their decision to make the bill a priority,
just six weeks before the elections, suggests how potent the cost
of prescription drugs has become as a political issue on the
campaign trail.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are comfortable with the Senate bill,'' Rep. Dick Armey of
Texas, the majority leader, said on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   A White House spokesman, Jake Siewert, said the bill ``may well
emerge from the rubble,'' and added, ``If they want to do the
Senate bill, it's fine with us.''
</P>
<P>
   The measure, drafted by Sen. James Jeffords, R-Vt., addresses
the disparities that force American consumers to pay two or three
times as much for some American-made drugs as do people in Canada,
Mexico and some other countries. Canada, for example, regulates the
price of drugs and does not allow retailers to charge more than set
amounts.
</P>
<P>
   The measure would allow pharmacies and wholesale distributors to
buy prescription drugs abroad at discount prices, re-import them
and then sell them to consumers at a lower cost. Although the
measure is designed to reduce drug prices in a roundabout way, it
is not likely to do so for about two years. That is how long it is
expected to take for the FDA to write new regulations that would
govern this new business. Experts say it it is too early to know
with any accuracy what volume of sales might flow through such a
route.
</P>
<P>
   The Senate bill, which was approved on July 19 by a vote of
74-21, also includes safeguards to protect consumers, something the
Food and Drug Administration said was necessary. It would require
the importer to provide large amounts of data to the FDA to ensure
that the drugs were authentic and complied with federal standards.
Tests would be conducted by the pharmacist, the wholesaler or the
manufacturer.
</P>
<P>
   ``We think there is something that should be done there,'' said
Sen. Trent Lott of Mississippi, the majority leader. ``We do want
to make sure about the safety aspects, and that's one of the things
that concerned the industry. The potential for fraud is very
strong, and you want to make sure that our people are not being
duped.''
</P>
<P>
   Lott said Congress may want to tighten up the safety provisions
``a little bit.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton on Tuesday praised the Republican leadership for
agreeing ``in the face of the drug companies' opposition, to give
Americans access to prescription drugs that are cheaper in other
countries.''
</P>
<P>
   Speaking on Tuesday morning at an event celebrating the economic
expansion, the president continued, ``I think it's wrong when drug
companies sell the same drugs for a much higher price at home than
they do overseas, even when those drugs are manufactured right here
in America.''

MAJOR GENE PREDISPOSING MEXICAN-AMERICANS TO DIABETES IDENTIFIED 
 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By TODD ACKERMAN 
c.2000 Houston Chronicle
<TEXT>
<P>
   An international research team led by scientists at University
of Texas Health Science Center at Houston has identified a major
gene that predisposes Mexican-Americans to adult-onset diabetes, a
discovery that promises earlier and better treatment.
</P>
<P>
   The finding pinpoints a new and unexpected pathway leading to
type 2 diabetes, the most common form of diabetes and the seventh
leading cause of death in the United States. The Hispanic frequency
of the disorder is triple that of the nation's overall frequency.
</P>
<P>
   ``To understand what happens in diabetes, the interaction of
genetic and lifestyle factors, you have to have a gene,'' said
Craig Hanis, a UT-Houston professor of biological sciences and
principal study investigator. ``Now that we have a gene, we can
find out what goes wrong and target those defects rather than the
symptoms.''
</P>
<P>
   The discovery marks the first time an analysis encompassing the
entire human genome has led to the identification of a gene
responsible for a complex, common disorder caused by genes and
lifestyle factors, a groundbreaking technique that could enable
other researchers to find genes that make people susceptible to
common chronic illnesses, such as hypertension, asthma and
psychiatric diseases.
</P>
<P>
   The discovery is the product of 19 years of research in Starr
County, Texas, a predominantly Hispanic county where the rate of
diabetes is higher than anywhere else in the state and several
times the national rate. Hanis' team studied blood samples from 346
sibling pairs from the county.
</P>
<P>
   Type 2 diabetes afflicts an estimated 135 million people
worldwide, including 15 million Americans. It is caused by insulin
deficiencies that allow a dangerous build-up of the sugar glucose
in the blood that can lead to stroke, blindness, heart disease,
kidney failure and limb amputations. It costs the United States $98
billion a year to treat and its frequency is on the rise worldwide,
mostly because of obesity.
</P>
<P>
   Hanis said he thought it would be 5 to 10 years before the
discovery leads to better treatment and longer than that before it
leads to treatment that prevents type 2 diabetes from occurring
Treatment options currently include insulin injections, pills and
diet and exercise recommendations.
</P>
<P>
   The newly identified gene accounts for about 14 percent of the
prevalence of type 2 diabetes in the Mexican-American population
(and about 4 percent of Europeans, a sample of whom were also
involved in the study.) But Hanis said he thinks the team will be
able to explain about 50 percent of the genetic component for
diabetes when it identifies another gene that works in conjunction
with the newly discovered one.
</P>
<P>
   The research was published in the October issue of the journal
Nature Genetics, which came out Tuesday. Submitted 1 1/2 years ago,
its publication was delayed by requests by journal editors for a
series of supporting studies to verify the discovery, so surprising
were the results. In the interval, another diabetes gene discovery
was published.
</P>
<P>
   ``Bell and colleagues' accomplishment is a `tour-de-force,' ''
said Dr. Allen Spiegel, director of the National Institute of
Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases in Phoenix. ``Actually
identifying susceptibility genes for diseases such as diabetes with
complex as opposed to simple (hereditary phenomena) has proved
exceedingly difficult.''
</P>
<P>
   In an unusual development, the team found that the variation in
the gene that causes diabetes susceptibility occurred in the ``junk
DNA'' that scientists previously thought separates functional
portions of a gene. Hanis said the discovery serves as a lesson
that scientists need to stop ignoring such sequencing, even though
it will make discovery more difficult.
</P>
<P>
   The newly discovered gene, called CAPN10, tells the body how to
make a protein called calpain-10, which breaks down other proteins,
activating or inactivating them. Hanis said the team never would
have thought to consider the calpain family if it had merely
searched for genes using the conventional technique.
</P>
<P>
   The team used a technique called ``positional cloning.'' It
exploits statistical analysis and landmarks along chromosomes to
zero in on target genes without prior knowledge about what the
genes normally do.
</P>
<P>
   In 1996, the team demonstrated a link between increased risk of
diabetes among the 346 Starr County siblings and a gene located
near one end of chromosome 2. No one studying a genetically complex
disease had then been able to take the next step of identifying the
specific gene indicated by the linkage.
</P>
<P>
   Hanis has conducted research and screened Starr County residents
for diabetes through the UT-Houston field office in Rio Grande City
that he and colleagues established in 1981. The team collected
family histories, clinical data and DNA samples while alerting many
residents for the first time that they had the disease.
</P>
<P>
   Hanis said his team will continue working with the Starr County
group, investigating what happens with diet and insulin changes and
searching for other genes. He said he expects other team members
and scientists will follow up with laboratory work, including
research into the discovery's pharmaceutical potential.
</P>
<P>
   Other authors of the paper included researchers at the Virginia
Mason research Center in Seattle, the University of Chicago, Tokyo
Women's Medical University, the University of Lund in Sweden and
Technical University in Germany. &QL;

KEY WITNESS IN LOCKERBIE TRIAL FAILS TO LINK SUITCASE, BOMB AND
FLIGHT 
</HEADLINE>
   By DONALD G. McNEIL Jr.   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   CAMP ZEIST, Netherlands _ The Libyan double agent considered the
most crucial witness in the Lockerbie trial testified Tuesday that
the two defendants brought a brown Samsonite suitcase to Malta like
the one believed to contain the bomb that destroyed Pan Am Flight
103.
</P>
<P>
   But if the prosecution was anchoring its case on the witness,
Abdul Majid Giaka, as it had indicated, it may have been
disappointed. He never said he saw a bomb put in the suitcase or
the suitcase put aboard a flight.
</P>
<P>
   Nor did he say that either defendant made any admission to him
about the bombing, which killed 270 people in the bombing over
Lockerbie, Scotland, in 1988.
</P>
<P>
   Giaka, who became an informant for the CIA just four months
before the bombing, spent only half a day testifying, mostly before
the prosecution. He will resume testifying, under defense
questioning, on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it's all over,'' Robert Black, a University of
Edinburgh law professor who has closely followed the trial, said of
the prosecution's case. ``They didn't get the damaging evidence,
the actual smoking gun. They needed him to say `I saw them putting
the bomb in the suitcase.' ''
</P>
<P>
   Scottish prosecutors do not outline their cases in opening
statements and do not update the press on how they're doing, so it
is difficult to tell what they hope to accomplish with each
witness. But the British press was once full of speculation that
Giaka, as a former intelligence agent, would firmly link the two
accused to the bomb plot.
</P>
<P>
   The trial, which began in May, is taking place in the
Netherlands under Scottish law, under a deal worked out with the
Libyan leader, Col. Moammar Gadhafi, who agreed to surrender the
two defendants only if they would not be tried in Britain or the
United States.
</P>
<P>
   Giaka, who at the time of the bombing was the deputy station
manager for Libyan Arab Airlines at the Malta airport, said that he
had discovered that his desk's drawers contained 25 pounds of TNT.
</P>
<P>
   He said his boss, the defendant Lamen Khalifa Fhimah, who shared
the desk and kept the key, told him it had been given to him by the
chief of airline security, who is the second defendant accused of
blowing up Pan Am 103, Abdel Basset Ali al-Megrahi. Fhimah and
Megrahi, both Libyans, have denied the charges against them.
</P>
<P>
   The purpose of the TNT was never explained; Pan Am 103 was not
blown up with TNT.
</P>
<P>
   Giaka also testified that in 1986, shortly after American jets
based in Britain bombed Libya, he wrote a report saying it would be
possible to slip an unaccompanied suitcase aboard a British plane
at the airport where he worked. Megrahi found out about the report,
Giaka testified, and cautioned him: ``Don't rush things.''
</P>
<P>
   It became clear Tuesday that Giaka was not a high-level
operative. He said he joined Libya's secret service in 1983 as an
auto mechanic, resigned two years later and was rehired as a file
clerk. Even at the Malta airport, despite his ``deputy station
manager'' title, he spent his time checking passenger lists and
helping Libyan VIPs clear customs.
</P>
<P>
   He did have one conversation about the bombing with Fhimah in
1991, he testified. In it, Fhimah angrily denounced America for
bombing Libya in 1986, and said, ``They never looked at the
possibility of a reaction,'' Giaka recalled. But he said nothing
that clearly indicated he had bombed Pan Am 103. Fhimah never even
admitted being an intelligence agent, Giaka said.
</P>
<P>
   One lingering mystery was not explored Tuesday: if Giaka, as he
testified, became a turncoat by walking into the U.S. Embassy in
Malta in August 1988, four months before the bombing, why didn't he
tip anyone off about it?
</P>
<P>
   Even if he hadn't known in time to thwart it, why did American
and Scottish investigators spend a whole year thinking their chief
suspects were a group of Syrian-backed Palestinians in Germany?
</P>
<P>
   Giaka's testimony was considered the prosecution's best chance
to link the two defendants to the bomb itself. Other witnesses have
established that the two were in Malta when the bomb was put on a
Malta Air flight that connected to Pan Am 103, and that Megrahi had
in earlier years bought Swiss bomb timers.
</P>
<P>
   Another witness, a Malta clothing store owner, was asked to
confirm that Fhimah had bought clothes that were later found,
singed, in the plane's debris, but his identification, 12 years
after the sale, seemed shaky.
</P>
<P>
   Because he has been given a new identity in the U.S. federal
witness protection program, Giaka's face was not seen Tuesday
except in the court itself. A white screen covered the glass wall
of the public gallery, and the closed circuit TV carrying the trial
reduced his face to a jumble of black and yellow squares. His voice
was electronically distorted until it sounded like Darth Vader
speaking Arabic slowly. Speaking on condition of anonymity, someone
who saw him said he wore a gray suit, was not masked and has
``Pavarotti-like jowls.''
</P>
<P>
   Published reports have said he is so afraid of being
assassinated that he agreed to meet prosecutors recently only on a
moving bus while wearing what was described as ``a Shirley Bassey
wig.''
</P>
<P>
   Giaka's testimony was supposed to begin last month, but the
defense and prosecution fell into a dispute over 25 CIA cables
about interviews with him between August 1988 and 1991, when he was
spirited aboard a United States warship off Malta and given asylum.
</P>
<P>
   The defense was given copies with whole pages blacked out; the
CIA claimed those parts would jeopardize American security. After
the defense protested and the court agreed, the agency handed over
less edited transcripts and 36 more cables.
</P>
<P>
   These gave the defense a wealth of material for attacking
Giaka's credibility. Apparently, after he was hired but before he
emerged in the bomb case, his CIA debriefers _ one of whom worked
undercover as a baggage handler _ became worried that he was an
opportunist and possibly a fraud.
</P>
<P>
   He approached the U.S. Embassy in August 1988 out of fear, he
testified today. He had been ordered back to Tripoli to explain an
incident in July.
</P>
<P>
   He said Fhimah, his boss, had made what was interpreted as a
sexual advance on an 18-year-old woman passenger, an Egyptian who
turned out to be a very angry relative of the late Egyptian
president, Gamal Abdel Nasser.
</P>
<P>
   Rather than be recalled to Libya for questioning, Giaka wanted
to defect to America. But the agency asked him to become a double
agent and paid him $1,000 a month, hoping he could penetrate upper
levels of the secret service in Libya. He also asked the CIA to pay
for sham surgery on his arm that would leave a scar and to provide
certification that he was unfit for military duty.
</P>
<P>
   Tuesday he said the agency helped pay for a $2,000 operation,
explaining that his doctor broke his arm and had it treated at a
Malta hospital. He also asked for a $30,000 loan to start a car
rental agency in Malta. Defense lawyers have said the CIA thought
he had another $30,000 that he might have made by using his job for
low-level smuggling.
</P>
<P>
   By 1990, the agency was considering cutting him off. He had
little information and the arm surgery also made him ineligible for
intelligence agency service, which his handlers then suspected had
been his real reason all along.
</P>
<P>
   Tuesday afternoon, William Taylor, a defense lawyer, lashed into
him on cross-examination, beginning by asking ``You aren't required
to be very bright to mend cars, are you?'' and demanding when the
witness got confused, ``Would you agree with the statement that a
liar has to have an excellent memory?''

   WORCESTER, Mass. _ Quickly and surely, the dating game is going high tech.
</P>
<P>
   Men and women in droves are using the Internet to make social connections
these days. Some people want a long-term partner. Others seek friends who
can share entertainment activities and sports. And there are those who are
perfectly satisfied with a pen pal.
</P>
<P>
   Four people from Central Massachusetts agreed to talk about the pros and
cons of high-tech dating. All are members of The Right One and Together, a
dating service billed as the largest in the nation that is increasingly
turning to computerized methods to make matches. Those interviewed are
identified only by their first names.
</P>
<P>
   Tony, who works as a consultant in quality assurance engineering at Compaq,
spends his days at a computer. And it is to the computer that he has turned
in an effort to find that special someone.
</P>
<P>
   Tony, 45, wants to meet a woman who is a doer, not a homebody. He prefers to
be with someone who is athletic and competitive. It will be a plus if she
plays golf; he is a devotee of the sport.
</P>
<P>
   Separated for 17 months and about to be divorced, Tony says he will keep
looking until he finds a permanent relationship, and high-tech methods might
shorten the search.
</P>
<P>
   ""It's another mechanism that gets you out to meet people,'' he says
matter-of-factly.
</P>
<P>
   The Web is now home to hundreds of sites that hold out the possibility of
finding love online. Some charge a fee, while others are free. Many of them
are crammed with personal ads. One more sophisticated site that's now 14
years old, Matchmaker.com, claims it has 2.6 million registered members and
25,000 people signing up each week.
</P>
<P>
   The sites range from the staid to the bizarre. One site allows a user to set
up a blind date between two people by sending e-mails inviting them to meet
at a certain time and place. Neither knows the other's name. The e-mail
message instructs each recipient to wear a small flower as an identifier.
The site reminds the cyberspace matchmaker: ""After that ... it's up to love
to decide.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, use of the Internet as a social negotiator has become so popular
that The Right One and Together, with roughly 100 bricks-and-mortar sites
across the country, is about to launch its own online division.
</P>
<P>
   Up to now, the organization, which has an office in Worcester, has used its
enhanced computer databases, with their reams of personal information on
each individual, solely as a resource for its ""relationship consultants''
to pair members. The service costs $1,000 to $3,000, depending on the number
of matches it guarantees in a certain period of time.
</P>
<P>
   But in the next couple of months, members who pay an additional fee will be
able to gain direct access to the databases _  secure sites protected from
public scrutiny _  and then select an appealing profile and arrange a date
by e-mail through a consultant.
</P>
<P>
   The company also is melding its regional databases into a national online
file that will allow users to find companionship while traveling on business
or on vacation, says Paul A. Falzone, chief executive officer.
</P>
<P>
   The explosion in Internet use over the past three years has compelled the
company to develop the ""user-friendly key to romance,'' as Falzone calls
it, or get frozen out of the matchmaking business.
</P>
<P>
   ""We're in a drive-through mentality society,'' Falzone says. ""People want
immediate results.''
</P>
<P>
   Tony says that before joining The Right One and Together, he used a Web site
that allowed him to post his photograph and to describe himself and the
criteria he was seeking in a mate. He quickly connected with a woman whom he
initially found appealing. As the relationship progressed, she became more
and more dependent, he says, telling him he was the love of her life. He
broke it off.
</P>
<P>
   ""She was clinging to me,'' he remembers. ""I felt suffocated.''
</P>
<P>
   Beverly, a 45-year-old divorcee, used a similar Web site. She came away
disillusioned.
</P>
<P>
   ""I did meet several men, but I found that through the Internet, people
misrepresent themselves,'' she says. ""They are shorter and 10 to 15 pounds
heavier than they say.
</P>
<P>
   ""I'm honest and out there,'' she adds. ""I assume people are what they say
they are _ and they're not.''
</P>
<P>
   Those experiences come as no surprise to Norman P. Tonelli, a West
Brookfield therapist. He says that while the online world can be helpful to
people who are not comfortable with the night life scene, it also comes with
risks. They can range from connecting with a person who is dangerous to one
who is socially inept, a characteristic that does not necessarily come
across in an exchange of e-mails.
</P>
<P>
   The kind of disappointment expressed by Beverly is not uncommon, Tonelli
says. In describing themselves, people often embellish their looks and
accomplishments to make up for real or perceived shortcomings.
</P>
<P>
   ""They are making up for the fact that face to face they are not skilled,''
Tonelli says. ""People meet and there are certain things that never came
across online. The Internet has its limitations.''
</P>
<P>
   Falzone says that part of the problem involves unrealistic expectations. He
recalls a 72-year-old man who didn't want to date anyone over 50, claiming
he was too full of life for an older woman.
</P>
<P>
   And there's the movie star pipe dream.
</P>
<P>
   ""I have to tell some women, "Tom Cruise isn't in our membership,' ''
Falzone says.
</P>
<P>
   Yet those waiting to find a soul mate seem to remain upbeat about their
prospects.
</P>
<P>
   Company consultants, for their part, plumb the depths to arrive at an
accurate picture of each member.
</P>
<P>
   To join the service, an applicant must submit to a 90-minute interview and
complete a form containing about 100 questions on a broad range of personal
attributes and interests. The company performs background and criminal
record checks. With the aid of a computer program, members are matched on
one dozen or more characteristics in common.
</P>
<P>
   James, 26, a software engineer, joined two months ago and has had one date.
It didn't work out, he says, but he describes the pairing as ""a valiant
try.''
</P>
<P>
   ""The more things you try that you have a chance at, the better off you'll
be,'' he remarks.
</P>
<P>
   Half a dozen women have come and gone from Tony's life since he joined The
Right One and Together. With little effort, he can reel off a precis of each
encounter.
</P>
<P>
   He dated the first woman for three months. Then she got nervous about his
presence in her life while her divorce was in the works. He is frank to
admit that the second woman was not impressed with him. The third was very
nice, he says. But there was no chemistry.
</P>
<P>
   And so it went.
</P>
<P>
   Nonetheless, Tony was eagerly anticipating the next date, which already had
been arranged.
</P>
<P>
   The concerns expressed by Tonelli are echoed by 56-year-old Bob. He has
spent his entire professional life in the computer business, but has little
interest gaining access to the dating company's database. A computerized
list of member profiles is just that _ a list, he points out.
</P>
<P>
   Falzone concedes that he has yet to develop a formula that will guarantee
that spark between two people who in many other ways appear likely to hit it
off.
</P>
<P>
   Beverly says it is just that lack of certainty that has led her to suspect
that computer dating may not address her needs after all. She has been
matched with seven men; none went beyond the second date.
</P>
<P>
   Several of the men were compatible enough, she says, but the chemistry was
missing.
</P>
<P>
   ""It's too planned,'' she reflects. ""I like the idea of eyeing someone
across a room.''

MICROSOFT, IN A TACTICAL VICTORY, GETS CASE RETURNED TO APPEALS
COURT 
</HEADLINE>
  (See also MICROSOFT-OUTLOOK, MICROSOFT-COURT) 
 By STEPHEN LABATON  
c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The Supreme Court handed a major tactical victory
to the Microsoft Corp. on Tuesday when it rejected the government's
plea to immediately hear the appeal of its landmark antitrust case
and instead returned the proceeding to a lower court.
</P>
<P>
   The decision gives Microsoft greater breathing room to pursue
its appeals, relieves the company of any pressure to return any
time soon to the bargaining table and, in the absence of a
settlement, could have the effect of prolonging a final court
judgment by a year or longer.
</P>
<P>
   It returns the case to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the
District of Columbia, which in the past has shown a greater
receptivity to Microsoft's legal defenses than the trial judge. And
it is virtually certain to have the effect of leaving the
supervision of the federal case in the hands of the next
administration, which Microsoft executives hope will be open to
reconsidering both the merits of the lawsuit and the order to break
up the company.
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft executives applauded Tuesday's decision.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm happy that we're moving on with the process,'' said Steven
A. Ballmer, the chief executive of Microsoft, in an interview in
San Francisco, where the company was announcing an alliance aimed
at capturing the high-end of the corporate computing world. ``We
are confident in our case on appeal.''
</P>
<P>
   For their part, Justice Department officials on Tuesday began
the process of preparing for a new round of court appearances. ``We
look forward to presenting our case to the court of appeals as
expeditiously as possible,'' said Gina Talamona, a department
spokeswoman.
</P>
<P>
   Before Tuesday's decision, the government had tried to
short-circuit the uncertainties associated with bringing the case
to the Court of Appeals by going directly to the Supreme Court
instead.
</P>
<P>
   Arguing that the case against Microsoft involved issues of
``immense importance to our national economy,'' the Justice
Department had urged the Supreme Court to invoke a rarely used
procedural rule to bypass the appeals court, quickly review the
case and uphold the order issued by Federal District Judge Thomas
Penfield Jackson three months ago to slice Microsoft into two
smaller companies. After a 78 day trial, Jackson ruled in April
that Microsoft, the world's largest software maker, had repeatedly
violated federal antitrust law, bullied rivals and stifled
competition and innovation. In June, Jackson ruled that the company
should be broken up but stayed that order pending appeal.
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft had opposed the government's request for immediate
Supreme Court review, saying it ``would impose an extraordinary
burden on the court'' and that there was no reason to depart from
the normal procedure of using the appeals court to narrow the
complex legal issues and voluminous trial record.
</P>
<P>
   On Tuesday, the Supreme Court, in a perfunctory three-sentence
order, agreed. It directed that the case be sent to the court of
appeals. The appeals court had already decided that seven judges _
not the usual three-member panel _ would hear the proceeding and
that it would move quickly. The full court has 10 members, but
three have recused themselves from this case for undisclosed
reasons.
</P>
<P>
   Within hours of the Supreme Court's announcement, the court of
appeals ordered the government and Microsoft to submit scheduling
proposals for its proceeding by Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Following its usual practice when it denies reviews, the Supreme
Court did not announce the actual vote among the nine justices. But
in a published dissent from Tuesday's decision, Justice Stephen G.
Breyer said he had voted to hear the appeal because the case
``significantly affects an important sector of the economy.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Speed in reaching a final decision may help create legal
certainty,'' Breyer wrote. ``That certainty, in turn, may further
the economic development of that sector so important to our
nation's prosperity.''
</P>
<P>
   For now, though, the court's decision dramatically reshapes the
contours of the case and is a big legal win for Microsoft on
several levels. Foremost among them is the timing of the case.
</P>
<P>
   For both Microsoft and the government, the timeline is crucial.
Experts have raised concerns that fast-paced changes in both the
technology and the marketplace may make the proposed remedy of
splitting Microsoft both irrelevant and unnecessary.
</P>
<P>
   Government officials have long feared that it was to Microsoft's
advantage to stretch out the time of the case as long as possible.
For its part, Microsoft has denied that it is interested in delay,
maintaining that its primary goal is getting the case dismissed as
quickly as possible.
</P>
<P>
   As he has in the past, Ballmer denied Tuesday that the company
had opposed immediate review by the Supreme Court in an effort to
slow down the legal process.
</P>
<P>
   ``For us the best resolution will be a court decision that
allows us to continue to innovate,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The appeals court includes two judges who in 1998 handed a legal
victory to Microsoft in a separate but related case. They ruled
that Jackson was wrong on the law when he ordered Microsoft to
immediately unbundle its Windows operating system and its Internet
Explorer Web browser. Earlier this year Jackson took the unusual
step of criticizing the appeals court ruling, saying that it
ignored antitrust precedents laid down by the Supreme Court.
</P>
<P>
   After they deliberate over the next few months, the seven judges
on the appeals court have a wide range of options, including
sending the case back to Jackson for further proceedings consistent
with their ruling, a process that could further delay a final
resolution.
</P>
<P>
   After the court of appeals rules, the case could still go to the
Supreme Court. But, since the Supreme Court is under no obligation
to review the eventual decision of the appeals court, that court
could have the last word, although that may not be known until some
time in 2001 or later.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, Tuesday's decision virtually assures that the
government's case will wind up under the control of a new
administration that could, if it wanted, either drop the federal
lawsuit or seek to rekindle settlement negotiations on less-onerous
terms than those offered by the Clinton administration. It remains
to be seen how closely the next administration would work with the
attorneys general in the 19 states who have brought a parallel
antitrust case against Microsoft.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   In an unusual statement attached to Tuesday's decision, Chief
Justice William H. Rehnquist defended his decision to participate
in the Microsoft case even though his son, James C. Rehnquist, is a
Boston lawyer representing Microsoft in private antitrust
litigation that could be affected by the outcome of the
government's antitrust lawsuit.
</P>
<P>
   Rehnquist said his son had no financial interests in the outcome
of the case, and that he did not believe that his impartiality
``might reasonably be questioned.''
</P>
<P>
   ``A decision by this court as to Microsoft's antitrust liability
could have a significant effect on Microsoft's exposure to
antitrust suits in other courts,'' Rehnquist said. ``But, by virtue
of this court's position atop the federal judiciary, the impact of
many of our decisions is often quite broad. The fact that our
disposition of the pending Microsoft litigation could potentially
affect Microsoft's exposure to antitrust liability in other
litigation does not, to my mind, significantly distinguish the
present situation from other cases that this court decides.''

BAZE STRETCHES ADVANTAGE
</HEADLINE>

 c.2000 San Gabriel Valley Tribune  
<TEXT>
<P>
   POMONA, Calif. _ Tyler Baze doesn't look old enough to drive a
car, but he knows how to handle thoroughbreds in traffic.
</P>
<P>
   The smiling 17-year-old extended his riding lead over jockey
Martin Pedroza at Fairplex, shifting gears down the stretch aboard
Warren's Whistle to capture the $50,000 Black Swan Stakes for
2-year-old fillies over the 1 1/16-mile course Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   It was Baze's second winner of the afternoon. He now has 21
victories at Fairplex, three ahead of Pedroza's 18.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's going to be the next California sensation,'' trainer
Melvin F. Stute said of Baze. Stute saddled Warren's Whistle.
``Only problem is if he doesn't get too big (in the head). He's a
young boy and a fast learner. He catches on so quick.
</P>
<P>
   ``The very first day he rode for me here, everyone was knocking
at the way he rode. It just took him one day to get the feel of
this track and ever since, he's been going.''
</P>
<P>
   Warren's Whistle's had to chase down the favorite, Madame Roar,
which had a clean trip for Pedroza. Warren's Whistle looked liked
she would run into traffic, but the rail opened up and she sped
right through. It was her second career victory after capturing a
$47,000 race at Del Mar on Aug. 5.
</P>
<P>
   ``It took some maneuvering, but we got her around there,'' Baze
said. ``I watched her (Madame Roar); she was getting tired and they
(the field) were really going slow at the end. I guess she
(Warren's Whistle) just had more in the tank.''
</P>
<P>
   Stute didn't know if she would get through, but he had his
fingers crossed.
</P>
<P>
   ``This wasn't a sterling field that she beat,'' he said. ``But
she's getting better. I actually didn't think Tyler had enough
horse left to catch the filly. But darned if he got her home.''
</P>
<P>
   Stute said a Cal-bred stakes at Oak Tree is probably the next
stop for Warren's Whistle.
</P>
<P>
   __ Weak field: Beau Brummel stakes winner Meetyouathebrig was a
late scratch for today's $50,000 Gateway to Glory Stakes, leaving a
weak field for the 1 1/16 mile event.
</P>
<P>
   Santa Ana Park, a maiden after four starts but a second-place
finisher to Meetyouathebrig in the Beau Brummel, figures to draw
the most wagering. But keep an eye on Al Rock, trained by Scott
Craigmyle, who has had success at this track. Another to pay
attention to is first time starter Rare Find.

MILITARY CHIEFS TO PRESS FOR ADDITIONAL FUNDING FOR EQUIPMENT,
TRAINING

 By STEVEN LEE MYERS and ERIC SCHMITT   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The nation's senior commanders will warn Congress
on Wednesday that the armed services are struggling with aging
equipment, shortages in spare parts and shortfalls in training that
will require billions of dollars in new spending, officials said on
Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Gen. Henry H. Shelton, the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of
Staff, and the commanders of the Army, Navy, Air Force and Marines,
will argue that the nation's front-line combat forces remain ready
to fight.
</P>
<P>
   But they will also warn that the readiness of some support units
has fallen, despite two years of budget increases approved by
President Clinton and Congress, officials familiar with their
prepared testimony said on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Beyond the state of today's military, the chiefs will also focus
much of their testimony on tomorrow's forces. They plan to argue
that the Pentagon's procurement budget, the money for new weapons
and equipment, has not risen quickly enough to begin replacing
aging weapons and equipment built during the Reagan years in the
1980s.
</P>
<P>
   The chiefs' testimony comes in the middle of a highly charged
political debate over the American military, and the officials said
that the warnings would offer ammunition to both sides.
</P>
<P>
   Their argument that readiness remains high among combat forces
undercuts accusations from some Republicans, including Gov. George
W. Bush of Texas, that American military might is fraying. At the
same time, their warnings about other readiness problems and aging
weapons echo many made by Bush and by other military officials in
recent weeks and months.
</P>
<P>
   The officials said the chiefs will use Wednesday's hearings to
begin making the case for increases in spending and the size of the
force, now at 1.4 million troops, although they may not propose
specific figures.
</P>
<P>
   While the Clinton administration has increased the procurement
budget to $60 billion, from $43 billion three years ago, the chiefs
believe they need at least $70 billion or more as new weapons
arrive in the years ahead, a senior defense official said. Others
have suggested the number should increase to nearly $100 billion.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've got an aging force structure _ in terms of airplanes,
ships, tanks, et cetera _ where obsolescence will start to come
into play,'' an official familiar with the chiefs' prepared
testimony said on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we don't accelerate the pace of replacing ships and
airplanes,'' the official added, ``we are not going to maintain the
steady-state requirements to keep the age of the force at the
current level _ not to mention modernizing it.''
</P>
<P>
   Debates over the Pentagon's budget have always been political
ones, but the hearings before the Armed Service committees of the
House and the Senate on Wednesday are expected to cast this year's
debate in an increasingly partisan hue.
</P>
<P>
   Congress has already adopted a $295 billion defense budget for
the fiscal year that begins on Sunday, and Clinton has signed it.
That has prompted administration officials to complain that the
timing of the hearings in the weeks before Election Day was simply
a partisan effort to force the chiefs into voicing readiness
concerns being raised by Bush and his running mate, Dick Cheney.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Carl Levin of Michigan, the senior Democrat on the Senate's
Armed Services Committee, said he had urged that the hearing be
postponed until after the election, only to be overruled by the
committee's Republican chairman, Sen. John W. Warner of Virginia.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think we should put the chiefs in a position where
they're caught in a political crossfire,'' Levin said. ``I don't
know how it's avoided in this setting, given the timing.''
</P>
<P>
   The chiefs appear intent to use the hearings as a platform to
begin making their case for increased defense spending under the
new administration, regardless of who wins in November.
</P>
<P>
   Both candidates have proposed increasing defense spending, with
Bush calling for $45 billion more over the next decade and Vice
President Al Gore going even further to propose spending another
$80 billion over the same period.
</P>
<P>
   While the officials said the chiefs have not yet completed
specific budget requests, it was clear that the shortfalls they
cited would cost more to fill than the $4.5 billion and $8 billion
annually the two candidates have proposed.
</P>
<P>
   ``The chiefs' appetite will be larger than anybody can
satisfy,'' a senior defense official said in an interview on
Tuesday. ``We are going higher, but they want to go higher still.''
</P>
<P>
   The current debate over the military's readiness _ and its
budget _ began two years ago when the chiefs at the time appeared
before similar hearings and warned that the reductions in forces
and spending after the Cold War had left them strapped.
</P>
<P>
   At the time, Clinton proposed increasing Pentagon spending by
$112 billion over six years. With additional funding from Congress
and emergency supplements to cover peacekeeping operations like the
one in Kosovo, the Pentagon's budget is now projected to grow by
nearly $160 billion, rising from the newly adopted budget of $295
billion to $332 billion by 2005.
</P>
<P>
   With the debate over spending intensifying, the administration
recently increased the Pentagon's future budgets by another $19.5
billion.
</P>
<P>
   The officials said the chiefs would emphasize steady
improvements in readiness, citing gains in morale, among other
things, following increases in pay and benefits. One official said
that the real impact will be felt in the year ahead as spare parts
and other equipment the budget increases paid for begin reaching
bases around the country.
</P>
<P>
   However, the chiefs are expected to argue that current readiness
continues to face strains because of the high pace of operations
overseas, which forces the services to give a lower priority to
those forces not deployed.
</P>
<P>
   One official said that a fighter wing based in Italy, for
example, can maintain peak performance, but it comes at the cost
for similar units in the United States, which must make do with
scarce parts and less money for training.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   In recent weeks, senior military officers have warned of
readiness problems. In testimony before a subcommittee last week,
the Army said it needed $4.6 billion to purchase new weapons, from
Abrams tanks to Apache helicopters. The Navy's inspector general
warned in a report released last week that the readiness of the
service's aircraft had declined because of shortages in spare parts
and training.
</P>
<P>
   As he stepped down as commander of forces in the Persian Gulf in
August, Gen. Anthony C. Zinni, warned of growing strains on
American troops. In an interview he, too, warned that the military
is stretching the life out of aging equipment _ a point the current
commandant of the Marine Corps, Gen. James L. Jones, is expected to
make on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   ``I climbed in a CH-46 helicopter when I was a lieutenant in
Vietnam,'' Zinni said. ``My son is a lieutenant and he climbs into
the same helicopter.''
</P>
<P>
   With increasing warnings about readiness from the senior ranks,
Secretary of Defense William Cohen met with the chiefs early this
month and cautioned them not to use politically charged debate as a
means to argue for increasing their budgets.
</P>
<P>
   The Pentagon's spokesman, Kenneth H. Bacon, said Cohen told them
``not to beat the drum with a tin cup in hand to try to generate
more pressure for defense spending but, on the other hand, to talk
honestly about pressures they face.''

c.2000 Houston Chronicle
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The U.S. Supreme Court will consider a Houston
father's argument that men should have the same rights as women in
gaining citizenship for their foreign-born children.
</P>
<P>
   A high-court decision in Joseph Boulais' favor could lead to
American citizenship for his Vietnam-born son, which would block
deportation proceedings.
</P>
<P>
   The justices, acting six days before the official start of their
new term, also said Tuesday that they will decide whether the PGA
Tour can require disabled golfer Casey Martin to walk the course
during professional tournaments, as his competitors do.
</P>
<P>
   In a case from Alabama, the court will determine if
non-English-speaking residents can sue a state agency to force it
to administer driver's license tests in foreign languages.
</P>
<P>
   The high court, which begins its new term Monday, is expected to
decide these cases by July.
</P>
<P>
   Boulais, who never married the Vietnamese mother of his son,
Tuan Anh Nguyen, argues that the federal Immigration and
Nationality Act's stricter requirements for American fathers
seeking U.S. citizenship for their children violates the
constitutional requirement that laws treat men and women equally.
</P>
<P>
   Fathers must establish their foreign-born child's paternity
according to state regulation, by acknowledging fatherhood in a
sworn written statement or getting a court decree before the
offspring reaches age 18. Mothers, to secure their child's U.S.
citizenship, must show that they gave birth to the child.
</P>
<P>
   Assuming that Nguyen was an American automatically by virtue of
his American father, Boulais did not prove his son's paternity
until it was too late to secure him U.S. citizenship. The
Immigration and Naturalization Service had classified Nguyen, who
fled Vietnam before the fall of Saigon in 1975, as a legal
immigrant.
</P>
<P>
   The INS, which seeks to deport Nguyen because of a
sexual-assault conviction, says the law is valid in making it
easier for mothers to gain their child's citizenship. Motherhood is
easier than fatherhood to document legally because mothers must be
present at the birth, the INS says.
</P>
<P>
   Congress, in passing nationality laws, also has broad
constitutional authority to set citizenship rules, the INS said.
</P>
<P>
   The New Orleans-based 5th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals agreed
with the INS in April, prompting Boulais to appeal to the Supreme
Court.
</P>
<P>
   The golf case concerns whether a federal law banning bias
against disabled people applies to professional sports leagues and,
hence, requires the Professional Golfers' Association of America to
accommodate Martin's disability, a congenital vascular condition
that makes walking painful.
</P>
<P>
   Martin says the Americans with Disabilities Act requires the PGA
to accommodate his disability by allowing him to use a golf cart
during competition.
</P>
<P>
   But the PGA counters that the disability law does not apply to
sports leagues, which must have one set of rules for all players to
protect the integrity of competition.
</P>
<P>
   The San Francisco-based 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals ruled
against the PGA in March, saying a golf course is a public
accommodation that the federal law requires be made accessible to
disabled people.
</P>
<P>
   The PGA, in its appeal to the Supreme Court, says the ADA was
never intended to require a professional sport to ``waive a
legitimate competitive rule to enable a would-be participant,
disabled or not, to more successfully compete.''
</P>
<P>
   The rule the tour is defending requires golfers to walk the
course during tournaments.
</P>
<P>
   In the Alabama case, the state Department of Public Safety says
the federal 1964 Civil Rights Act does not allow
non-English-speaking residents to legally challenge the agency's
policy of testing applicants for driver's licenses in English only.
The state, while defending its English-only test as important to
road safety, says the 1964 law requires residents to take their
grievance to the U.S. Transportation Department, which is
responsible for providing funds to the state agency.
</P>
<P>
   Plaintiffs in Alabama argue that the English-only tests
discriminate on the basis of national origin in violation of the
1964 law, which prohibits state agencies that receive federal funds
from discriminating.
</P>
<P>
   The Atlanta-based 11th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals agreed. In
other cases:
</P>
<P>
   The justices agreed to consider whether the Constitution permits
police, without a warrant, to use high-tech heat-detecting
equipment to discover whether criminal activity is occurring in
someone's home.
</P>
<P>
   Oregon police, using a thermal imaging device, detected high
heat levels being emitted inside Danny Lee Kyllo's home, a possible
sign that high-intensity lights were being used to grow marijuana.
Kyllo was arrested and convicted of intentionally manufacturing
marijuana. Because of his otherwise clean record, his 63-month
prison sentence was reduced to one month.
</P>
<P>
   Kyllo appealed his conviction, arguing that the thermal imaging
of his home violated his Fourth Amendment protection from
unreasonable police search.
</P>
<P>
   The justices will consider whether Montana prison officials can
prevent prisoners from providing lawyerly assistance to fellow
inmates.
</P>
<P>
   The prisoners argue that Montana's policy violates their First
Amendment right to free speech. The state counters that its
compelling safety need to monitor prisoners' correspondence trumps
their constitutional right.
</P>
<P>
   In November, the 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals agreed with
the inmates  &QL;

<P>
   ANN ARBOR, Mich. _ He did not have to choose between boxers or
briefs. But in a lengthy MTV forum that was broadcast Tuesday
night, Vice President Al Gore did reveal that he had a compact disc
by the alternative rock band Sister Hazel in his CD player right
then, that he would probably write for a living if he were not
otherwise employed next year, and that he coveted Air Force I more
than any other White House perquisite.
</P>
<P>
   Between hip cultural references about Napster and the World
Wrestling Federation (``Smackdown!'' Gore exclaimed when the topic
was raised), the vice president explained his support for civil
unions between homosexuals, his opposition to the legalization of
medical marijuana and his distaste for misogynistic music. He was
not asked about his underwear preference, as President Clinton was
in a now infamous 1994 MTV forum (``Usually briefs,'' he
responded).
</P>
<P>
   Gore said little in the 90-minute session that he had not said
previously during the campaign. But he clearly relished the
opportunity to take his case directly to 150 students in an
auditorium at the University of Michigan and to a youthful
nationwide television audience. A recent poll by MTV found that
less than half of those ages 18 to 24 said they planned to vote
this year, compared with 80 percent of older Americans.
</P>
<P>
   Wearing khaki Dockers and a sage shirt, Gore pledged to commit
more money to college financial aid, to protect the environment and
to safeguard abortion rights. But the drama of the session was
provided by the students' ability to personalize questions on
subjects the Gore campaign is accustomed to addressing in position
papers and statements.
</P>
<P>
   A black student asked Gore about racial profiling by telling how
he was recently surrounded by six police cars while driving with
four black friends. A gay man asked why his heterosexual friends
should be able to drive to Las Vegas and marry someone they barely
know when he cannot form a legal union with a longtime, committed
partner. A woman who opposes abortion rights asked about that issue
by pointing out that her friends sometimes use abortion as a form
of birth control.
</P>
<P>
   Responding to the question about profiling, Gore pledged to sign
a ban on the practice as ``the first civil rights act of the 21st
century.''
</P>
<P>
   On gay rights, he said he strongly favors ending discrimination
against gays and lesbians. ``I just think we've come to the point
in our nation's history where it's time to take that step,'' he
said. ``It's indefensible. Let's just leave people alone and stop
discriminating against them because of who they fall in love
with.''
</P>
<P>
   Gore said he supported civic unions like those recently approved
in Vermont.
</P>
<P>
   On abortion, the vice president said that RU-486, the abortion
pill, should be made available once the Food and Drug
Administration determines it is safe. He also agreed that the
practice should not be used as a form of birth control.
</P>
<P>
   ``But I think that it's not for the government to make that
choice,'' Gore said. ``I deeply respect your view and I think
actually the pro-life and pro-choice forces in this country have
more in common than either side is willing to acknowledge. Both
sides would like to see a reduction in the number of abortions, and
the way to do that is to reduce the number of situations where
women feel like they have to make that choice.''
</P>
<P>
   Gore also took questions on popular culture and the
entertainment industry, which has been a focus of his campaign this
month.
</P>
<P>
   He said he did not support censorship. But he also did not
hesitate to offer his personal view that Americans should protest
entertainment that advocates homophobia, violence against women or
racial discrimination. ``I don't go along with the notion that if
material like that becomes widely accepted and nobody thinks a
second thought about it that there are no consequences to it,'' he
said. ``I think that what we listen to and enjoy and spread around
in our culture does have an effect on us.''
</P>
<P>
   One student told Gore he was tempted to vote for Ralph Nader,
the Green Party candidate, and challenged him to ``assure me that a
vote for Al Gore is a conscientious vote, not simply a vote for the
lesser of two evils.'' Gore cited his support for tough
environmental enforcement and consumer protections.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think anybody wants to feel like they have no
options,'' Gore said. ``At the same time, they don't want to cast a
meaningless vote that doesn't have an impact on the outcome.''

BILL TO ALLOW MORE FOREIGN HIGH TECH WORKERS STALLS 
 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By JENNIFER HOYT 
c.2000 HOUSTON CHRONICLE
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The Senate agreed Tuesday to consider legislation
expanding the number of high-tech foreign workers allowed to work
in the United States, but the measure has been caught up in a
partisan dispute.
</P>
<P>
   Democrats want to expand the bill to lower immigration barriers
for almost a million people, including amnesty to hundreds of
thousands living in the United States illegally.
</P>
<P>
   Republicans have blocked the proposal, which has White House
support, and accused Democrats of playing politics in an election
year.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Democrats said they want to add the lower immigration
barriers to a bill to fund the Commerce, State and Justice
departments in 2001 and warned Republicans that without the changes
President Clinton would veto the spending bill.
</P>
<P>
   The Senate bill, a top legislative priority for the nation's
high-tech industry, would increase the number of H-1B visas for
highly skilled foreign workers from the current 115,000 a year to
195,000 annually through 2002.
</P>
<P>
   With employment at an all-time high, computer companies and
allied services say there are not enough American workers for all
the high-tech vacancies now. This year's visas had been allocated
by the end of March and under current law the number of high-tech
visas for foreign workers is set to drop over the next few years.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's critical to our information technology age; it's critical
to our high-tech companies,'' said Sen. Orrin Hatch, R-Utah.
</P>
<P>
   Hatch told Democrats on the Senate floor that the bill was
``being held hostage because you want to give amnesty to 500,000
illegal immigrants.''
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Phil Gramm, R-Texas, said, ``I think the Democrats are
embarrassing themselves by making it clear they're not really for
this bill.''
</P>
<P>
   Democrats countered that they support increasing the number of
high-tech visas, adding that fairness dictates giving a similar
break to immigrants who are unskilled or semi-skilled as outlined
in the proposed Latino and Immigrant Fairness Act.
</P>
<P>
   Republicans ``would rather risk delaying passage of the H-1B
visa bill than vote for the Latino and Immigrant Fairness Act or
risk the political consequences of voting against it,'' said Sen.
Tom Daschle, D-S.D.
</P>
<P>
   Among other things, the Latino legislation would ease
restrictions on immigrants from Guatemala, El Salvador, Honduras
and Haiti to become permanent residents. The rules were relaxed in
1997 for Nicaraguans and Cubans.
</P>
<P>
   The measure also would allow illegal immigrants who entered the
United States before 1986 to apply for permanent residency and
would reinstate a provision of immigration law that had allowed
immigrants to remain in the United States while waiting to receive
their green cards.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is pro-business and pro-family,'' Daschle said. ``It is
modest and it's long, long overdue. We do not intend to let this
Congress end until it is signed into law.''
</P>
<P>
   Senate Majority Leader Trent Lott of Mississippi said it could
be three or four days before the Senate votes on the H-1B
legislation.

BUSH STRATEGY TIES ECONOMY, EDUCATION
</HEADLINE>
  By JAMES DAO   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ For decades, political scientists have considered
the economy the single best predictor of the electorate's mood.
Good times favor incumbents, bad times insurgents. And so for Gov.
George W. Bush, one challenge has loomed high above the others in
his quest for the White House: how to defeat a sitting vice
president in good times.
</P>
<P>
   For a while, Bush led Gore in polls even as the economy hummed
along. But his lead has vanished. And the issue that once seemed to
play so well for him, character, has diminished in importance, the
polls show.
</P>
<P>
   It is largely for that reason, many political analysts say, that
Bush has adopted a new slogan: ``education recession.'' Ostensibly,
it refers to what he calls a ``crisis'' in the nation's public
schools. But at its heart, the slogan is also meant to raise alarms
about the health of the nation's economy in the not-too-distant
future.
</P>
<P>
   And in raising those red flags, the analysts say, Bush has
turned his signature issue, education, into a weapon for slashing
at the central arguments for electing Vice President Al Gore: peace
and prosperity.
</P>
<P>
   ``Gore's advantage on the economy is critical for Bush to try to
overcome,'' said Evans Witt, president of the Princeton Survey
Research, a polling firm. ``If you say we're in a recession long
enough, it certainly has an economic connotation, even if you are
using it to discuss education.''
</P>
<P>
   Karen Hughes, Bush's communications director, acknowledged as
much, saying, ``The point of this is that, while the economy is
strong, there are problems in society.''
</P>
<P>
   In his acceptance speech last month at the Republican National
Convention, Bush accused President Clinton and Gore of having
``squandered'' the opportunities of the economic boom. But during a
tour of the West Coast this week, he painted a darker picture.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are some warning signs in America,'' he told an audience
in an elementary school near Portland, Ore., on Monday. Then he
ticked them off: Gasoline prices spiraling out of control. Farmers
struggling to survive. The nation in danger of losing its
technological edge. And illiterate youths on the cusp of
criminality.
</P>
<P>
   ``In some places, there is a recession in America,'' Bush said
on Tuesday at a high school in northern California. ``In some
school districts there is a recession, and this country needs to do
something about it early, before it's too late.''
</P>
<P>
   At times he sounded like John F. Kennedy warning the nation
about a ``missile gap'' with the Soviet Union in the 1960 campaign.
</P>
<P>
   ``If American students don't lead the world in math and science,
the next generation of Americans may not lead the world,'' Bush
said.
</P>
<P>
   Raising concerns about the economy represents something of a
tactical shift for Bush, who has spent much of the campaign
attacking Gore's character and credibility. But several recent
polls indicate that voters now see little difference between the
candidates in terms of their morality and honesty.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's much harder for Bush because he can't hammer at character
anymore,'' Witt said.
</P>
<P>
   But some analysts said Bush would have trouble tapping into
voters' anxieties about the economy, because there is so little
there to tap. According to a Fox News poll taken last week, 60
percent of voters said they thought the country is headed in the
right direction, one of the highest readings since January 1998.
</P>
<P>
   And a Gallup Poll conducted in June showed that only 22 percent
of Americans said that the most important issues in the race were
economic, compared to 69 percent who felt that way in the fall of
1992.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think it makes much sense,'' said James Campbell, a
professor of political science at the State University of New York
at Buffalo who has studied the impact of the economy on
presidential elections. ``There are no obvious clouds on the
horizon.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, Frank Newport, editor in chief of the Gallup Poll, said
he could see the logic to Bush's strategy because voters care
deeply about economic issues even in good times.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not top of mind this year,'' Newport said. ``But when we
mention the economy, people say, `Oh yes, that will be very
important. How the candidates handle the economy is important.'''
</P>
<P>
   Some analysts also said that raising concerns about the economy
could strike a chord with working class voters, typically families
who earn less than $40,000 a year and live paycheck to paycheck.
Polls show those people tend to be swing voters whose allegiances
could easily change if they felt the economy were turning sour.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, aides to Bush said their internal polls had shown that
the slogan ``education recession'' had played well among
independent voters and women.
</P>
<P>
   Witt noted that many such swing voters live in the industrial
Midwestern states where the race is being most closely contested,
including Missouri, Michigan, Pennsylvania and Ohio. And they are a
group that might find Bush's plan for across-the-board income tax
cuts appealing, he asserted.
</P>
<P>
   ``Bush has hit pretty heavily on the idea that Gore's tax cut
may leave people out,'' Witt said. ``That's a point that I think
might resonate with some people in this group. Because they are on
the edge.''
</P>
<P>
   Several analysts also said they thought it was clever of Bush to
tie two issues together in a way that could undermine Gore's
support.
</P>
<P>
   ``It has a subliminal quality to it,'' said Stephen Hess, a
presidential scholar at the Brookings Institute, a nonpartisan
policy organization. ``It reminds us that there is more that can go
wrong.''

<P>
   REDWOOD CITY, Calif. _ The FBI should focus more attention on
the presidential campaign of Democrat Al Gore in investigating the
mysterious delivery to a Gore adviser of confidential
debate-preparation materials from Republican George W. Bush, a Bush
spokeswoman said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Bush Communications Director Karen Hughes said that the campaign
has been cooperating fully with the FBI since a videotape of a Bush
debate practice session and related documents turned up in the Gore
camp two weeks ago.
</P>
<P>
   She said she was sure that no one in the Bush campaign had
anything to do with compromising the materials, but she said she
didn't know if the FBI has adequately investigated the Gore
campaign.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm suggesting that a thorough investigation of how the Gore
campaign ended up with proprietary Bush campaign materials involves
not just the Bush campaign but also the Gore campaign,'' Hughes
said.
</P>
<P>
   On Sept. 13, a package bearing an Austin return address was
delivered to the Washington office of former Democratic congressman
Thomas Downey, who had been helping Gore prepare for the debates. &UR;
</P>
<P>
   &LR; After determining that the package contained Bush debate
preparation material, he turned it over to the FBI. Downey, who
said he watched part of the videotape before realizing what it was,
also withdrew from his role as a debate coach for Gore.
</P>
<P>
   The first of three debates between Bush and Gore is scheduled
for Tuesday night in Boston.
</P>
<P>
   Hughes said that only high-level Bush staffers had access to the
materials. She said the originals had been located and that the
copies had to have been prepared and provided to the Gore campaign
by ``some unethical means.``
</P>
<P>
   Bush himself later commented on the matter in an interview with
MSNBC. ``I just want to know what's happened,'' Bush said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know this: Someone who is for me for president didn't send
the material up there. I look forward to finding out what the facts
are. Somebody, I guarantee you, is sweating bullets because they
are beginning to home in on this,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Published reports last weekend quoted unnamed sources as saying
the FBI was focusing its investigation on a Bush campaign worker.
</P>
<P>
   In a story posted on its Web site Tuesday night, The Dallas
Morning News identified that worker as an Austin woman who employed
by Bush's media consultant, Mark McKinnon. She came to FBI
attention after agents obtained a security camera film of her
mailing a package, the News reported.
</P>
<P>
   Yvette Lozano, 30, told the Dallas newspaper that the package
she was photographed sending Sept. 11 from an Austin post office
contained a pair of khaki trousers her boss was returning to a
clothing chain.
</P>
<P>
   Lozano said FBI agents questioned her Thursday and Friday.
</P>
<P>
   ``They kept saying, `Those weren't pants in that package,'''
Lozano said. She denied having any knowledge about the Bush debate
package.
</P>
<P>
   Hughes said that several high-level Bush staffers have been
interviewed by the FBI.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think the more questions the FBI asks, the more nervous
people at the Gore campaign are getting,'' she added.
</P>
<P>
   The Gore campaign on Saturday announced that it had put a
staffer, Michael Doyne, 28, on paid administrative leave while Gore
officials investigated a report that Doyne had boasted about the
Democratic campaign having a mole in the Bush camp.
</P>
<P>
   Gore campaign officials said they believed Doyne's boast was a
joke, but Hughes said, ``We think that is something that is very
serious and it ought to be looked at.``
</P>
<P>
   Gore spokesman Chris Lehane responded that the FBI can decide
how to handle its investigation.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're experts in this area,'' Lehane said. ``I think people
should be careful about trying to politicize an FBI investigation.
I think if you look at the way we handled the issue, it speaks
volumes. Once Mr. Downey received this unsolicited tape, he
immediately contacted his lawyer and turned it over.``
</P>
<P>
   Hughes said the Bush campaign was still waiting for a return
phone call from FBI Director Louis Freeh to discuss the
investigation. Bush campaign manager Joe Allbaugh called Freeh on
Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   A Freeh subordinate returned the call, but that wasn't
satisfactory, Hughes said.
</P>
<P>
   Texas Democratic Chairwoman Molly Beth Malcolm said Tuesday that
she believes the Bush campaign sent the videotape to the Gore
campaign as a ``dirty trick'' to distract from issues and
potentially create a character issue if Gore kept the material.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's just absurd,'' Hughes responded. ``I ask you to
consider the source, to immediately discount that.``
</P>
<P>
   Malcom said the incident ``has Karl Rove's fingerprints all over
it,'' referring to Bush's chief campaign strategist.
</P>
<P>
   In 1986, when Rove was working on the campaign of former Gov.
Bill Clements, a private investigator reported finding an
electronic listening device in Rove's Austin office. Political
consultant McKinnon _ then working for Clements' opponent, Gov.
Mark White _ suggested that the bug created a political distraction
and that Clements' campaign had more to gain from planting it than
anyone in the White camp.
</P>
<P>
   An FBI investigation of that incident was inconclusive.

``Many animals have a lot more intelligence than they're given
credit for,'' says Irene Pepperberg, a visiting professor at MIT.
Pepperberg asks Alex, a grey parrot, to identify a green key.
Pepperberg believes her work shows animals don't merely respond to
stimulus, as behaviorists argue, but actually think. For
Pepperberg, years of testing her 23-year-old parrot, Alex, confirm
that birds with a walnut-size brain can do more than mimic or learn
rote behavior; she said her parrots reason, comprehend, and
calculate at the level of a 4-year-old child.(Wendy Maeda/The

Pepperberg believes her work shows animals don't merely respond to
stimulus, as behaviorists argue, but actually think. For
Pepperberg, years of testing her 23-year-old parrot, Alex, confirm
that birds with a walnut-size brain can do more than mimic or learn
rote behavior; she said her parrots reason, comprehend, and

``Many animals have a lot more intelligence than they're given
credit for,'' says Irene Pepperberg, a visiting professor at MIT.
Pepperberg asks Alex, a grey parrot, to identify a green key.
Pepperberg believes her work shows animals don't merely respond to
stimulus, as behaviorists argue, but actually think. For
Pepperberg, years of testing her 23-year-old parrot, Alex, confirm
that birds with a walnut-size brain can do more than mimic or learn
rote behavior; she said her parrots reason, comprehend, and
calculate at the level of a 4-year-old child.(Wendy Maeda/The

CONSERVATIVE GROUPS TOILING FOR BUSH BEHIND THE SCENES 
</HEADLINE>
   By RICHARD L. BERKE    
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ In the latest example of how Gov. George W. Bush is
going out of his way to avoid being pegged as too conservative by
moderate voters, he has decided to skip what for the last two
Republican presidential nominees was a must-stop on the election
circuit: the Christian Coalition convention that opens here on
Friday.
</P>
<P>
   But the lack of attention is not stopping the coalition and
other conservative organizations _ from anti-abortion groups to the
National Rifle Association _ from intensifying behind-the-scenes
efforts on his behalf.
</P>
<P>
   They are pouring millions of dollars into phone banks,
commercials and voter drives to help elect Bush. And they are
hammering away on issues that Bush is not addressing in his
campaign speeches, from abortion to guns to Vice President Al
Gore's character.
</P>
<P>
   Pat Robertson, the Christian Coalition chairman and founder,
said that his group would be far more active in aiding the
Republican presidential ticket than it was four years ago. In a
letter to supporters this month, he wrote, ``Our naysayers are in
for a big shock this November!''
</P>
<P>
   Another organization, the Conservative Leadership Political
Action Committee, sent out more than a million letters in the past
several days to raise money and mobilize voters in battleground
states.
</P>
<P>
   In the mailing, Lyn Nofziger, a former aide to President Ronald
Reagan, wrote: ``The reason we formed this emergency committee is
that George W. Bush and the Republican Party cannot talk clearly
and plainly about Al Gore's record of corruption and scandal
without being accused of negative campaigning. But we can. And we
are.''
</P>
<P>
   Still another group, the American Conservative Union, said it
was distributing more than 3 million copies of a book it published
that raises doubts about Gore.
</P>
<P>
   ``You know the liberal media will not tell America about Al
Gore's far-left socialist vision for America,'' David Keene, the
group's chairman, said in a letter to supporters.
</P>
<P>
   Some of the same groups that helped Bush win the South Carolina
primary after his defeat in New Hampshire have re-emerged.
</P>
<P>
   The Republican Ideas Political Committee has been running a TV
commercial in Kansas City, Mo., urging support of Republicans. It
features a woman saying she took her son out of public schools
partly because there was ``a bit more diversity than he could
handle.'' The group has ties to Grover Norquist, head of Americans
for Tax Reform, which financed commercials to help Bush during the
primaries.
</P>
<P>
   In past campaigns, conservative groups did not hesitate to
savage Republican candidates _ even at the risk of damaging the
party's prospects _ who were not viewed as sufficiently outspoken
on their causes. But conservatives have been notably quiet this
year and resisted criticizing Bush because they felt he had a clear
shot at winning.
</P>
<P>
   Even as the polls have tightened, and Bush is not viewed as much
as a sure bet, many conservatives said they were sticking with him.
</P>
<P>
   Still, while they seek to galvanize their supporters, some
prominent conservatives said they had misgivings lately about the
Bush campaign. Some complained that Bush had allowed Gore to seize
the issue of Hollywood and morality. Other said Bush should have
made more of the Supreme Court ruling supporting the Boy Scouts'
right to expel a gay assistant scoutmaster.
</P>
<P>
   The most striking comments came from Robertson, who has been
quite supportive of Bush. For the first time, he raised warnings
about the Republican nominee's strategy, saying that by declining
to address the convention he was neglecting conservatives at his
own peril.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's very risky,'' he said. ``It takes a lot of energy and
effort to get out and work precincts and lick envelopes and go to
churches. If you want the troops to go out and fall on their swords
for you, it doesn't hurt for the general to stand up and say, `I
need your help.'''
</P>
<P>
   Robertson also said that Gore's running mate, Sen. Joseph
Lieberman of Connecticut, who has been outspoken on the subjects of
values and religion, could eat into Bush's support. ``With
Lieberman, there's going to be some defection on moral issues,'' he
said, ``and they have to be aware of that.''
</P>
<P>
   Asked about Bush's prospects, Robertson said, ``They're very
iffy. They've lost the commanding lead they had. Republicans have a
marvelous facility for snatching defeat from the jaws of victory.''
</P>
<P>
   Gary Bauer, who took on Bush in the primaries and now leads the
conservative Campaign for Working Families, said he had no major
objections, but thought social issues should be better emphasized.
``The party could still do more on a variety of values issues where
the division between Gore and Bush remains substantial,'' he said,
``everything from the Boy Scouts issue to Hollywood.''
</P>
<P>
   The NRA, aware that it could be damaging if Bush is closely
identified with the group, has tentatively decided not to endorse
him. But the association is spending millions of dollars to help
him and to discredit Gore. Bush himself this month endorsed a group
connected to the NRA, but with a name not apt to stoke controversy:
the Law Enforcement Alliance of America.
</P>
<P>
   Bush's disinclination to promote his opposition to abortion was
evident at a town hall meeting in Albuquerque, N.M., about two
weeks ago, when an abortion foe looked for assurance on his stand.
The governor gave it, but only as he said that good people could
disagree on the subject.
</P>
<P>
   Such caution does not seem to bother abortion opponents like
David N. O'Steen, executive director of the National Right to Life
Committee. He said he would not press Bush to raise the abortion
issue next week during his first debate with Gore.
</P>
<P>
   O'Steen's organization is not so timid, having sent thousands of
flyers to Republicans around the country castigating Gore for his
stand on abortion. The flyer quotes a letter in 1997 from Cardinal
Roger Mahony, the archbishop of Los Angeles, who said he was
``appalled'' by the vice president's remarks.
</P>
<P>
   Ari Fleischer, a campaign spokesman, said Bush would not attend
the Christian Coalition event because it would ``conflict with our
debate preparations this weekend.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Despite his decision not to attend _ coalition officials said
Bush's running mate, Dick Cheney, also declined _ Bush has
generally drawn better treatment from religious conservatives than
Bob Dole, the Republican nominee in 1996, did.
</P>
<P>
   Dole spoke at the coalition's convention, but Robertson was
hardly supportive, telling the crowd Dole would probably lose. ``On
my personal opinion,'' he said at that time, ``there has got to be
a miracle from Almighty God to pull it out.''

 WASHINGTON: in America.''  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Despite Tuesday's accord, the bill's path to the president's
desk remains somewhat rocky. The measure is now attached to an
agriculture spending bill, which is tangled up in a dispute over
legislation to weaken the U.S. economic embargo against Cuba. That
conflict must be resolved before the bill can be voted on in the
House or the Senate.
</P>
<P>
   Still, at some point, Congress must pass a bill to finance the
Department of Agriculture, and if all goes as expected, the measure
would be tucked inside. ``If it's not done, it's as close to done
as anything can be,'' said Sen. Byron L. Dorgan, D-N.D., a
co-sponsor of the legislation.
</P>
<P>
   John P. Feehery, a spokesman for House Speaker Dennis Hastert,
said the Senate language may be ``tweaked'' a bit, but should not
pose an obstacle.
</P>
<P>
   By pushing the prescription drug reimportation bill, over
protests of the pharmaceutical industry, Republicans hope to
inoculate themselves against Democratic charges that they have done
nothing to make prescription drugs more affordable for senior
citizens.
</P>
<P>
   Drug manufacturers have lobbied vigorously to kill the drug
reimportation measure in recent weeks, running expensive television
advertisements to get their message out.
</P>
<P>
   On Monday, Hastert and Lott sent a letter to Clinton indicating
their desire to act on the drug reimportation bill, among other
things. They said time was running out for action on broader
legislation to establish prescription drug benefits for the eldely
under Medicare.
</P>
<P>
   While Democrats said they were pleased with Tuesday's
developments, they made it clear they would not back down from the
goal of securing drug coverage through Medicare.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think they are feeling the heat,'' Rep. Dick Gephardt, the
Democratic leader, said of the Republicans. ``They feel they have
got to move on something, and I'm glad they are finally moving on
something.''
</P>
<P>
   The provisions of the Senate bill would take effect only if the
secretary of health and human services certified to Congress that
the measure would ``pose no risk to the public's health and
safety,'' and that it would produce ``a significant reduction in
the cost'' of prescription drugs to American consumers.
</P>
<P>
   Ronald J. Streck, president of the National Wholesale Druggists'
Association, said, ``The demand for imported prescription drugs
could be quite high because importers will advertise low-price
imported medicines in newspapers and magazines, on television and
over the Internet.''
</P>
<P>
   The Clinton administration said the FDA would need $23 million
to develop a new system of regulating imported drugs. House
Republicans said they were willing to provide that amount.
</P>
<P>
   Under the Senate bill, importers would have to provide large
amounts of data to the Food and Drug Administration to show, for
example, that a statistically valid sample of all drug shipments
had been tested to ensure compliance with federal standards.
</P>
<P>
   Imported drugs would have to have the same color, formulation,
labeling and dosage as products approved for sale in the United
States. Importers would have to maintain records showing the
``chain of custody'' of the drugs. They would have to inform the
FDA of the ``points of origin and destination'' for imported drugs;
the wholesale and retail prices, and ``the manufacturer's lot or
control number'' for each shipment.
</P>
<P>
   Under existing law, a prescription drug made in the United
States and exported to another country may not be reimported, in
large quantities, except by the manufacturer. The law, adopted in
1988 as a consumer protection measure, sought to choke off a ``gray
market'' for drugs that were counterfeit, adulterated or too old to
be used safely.
</P>
<P>
   Congressional investigators had documented many cases in which
counterfeit drugs, including birth control pills, had been
imported. Drug companies say counterfeit drugs are still a major
problem in Mexico and many other countries.
</P>
<P>
   The National Wholesale Druggists' Association opposed the
legislation. Streck, the president of the association, said
``wholesalers do not have the experience, equipment or personnel''
to sample, test, re-label and track imported drugs.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Wholesalers also expressed concern that they could incur costly
new legal liability for the imported drugs, and they said they
would have to pass on such costs to consumers.
</P>
<P>
   It is not clear whether drug companies would cooperate in
efforts to import low-price versions of their products. ``Why would
manufacturers produce additional product in Canada, or export
additional product from the United States to Canada, so it could be
sold at a lower price in this country?''
</P>
<P>
   Streck said he feared that low-price counterfeit drugs would
flow into the United States to meet the demand not met by
manufacturers.
</P>
<P>
   John C. Rother, chief lobbyist for AARP, formerly known as the
American Association of Retired Persons, said: ``This legislation
should not be viewed as a substitute for insurance coverage. We
still need Medicare drug benefits.''
</P>
<P>
   Alan F. Holmer, president of the Pharmaceutical Research and
Manufacturers of America, said drug companies opposed the
legislation because ``it would put American patients at risk by
making it easier for counterfeit, adulterated or subpotent
medicines to enter the country.''

BOLD THEMES IN A LYNNE CHENEY NOVEL 
</HEADLINE>
   By CAREY GOLDBERG   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Dr. Elaine Showalter, an English professor at Princeton
University, was browsing a used-book stall in Paris in the early
1990s when she came upon an astonishing find: an Old West romance,
replete with whorehouses, lesbian affairs and attempted rapes,
written by an author whose name was all too familiar to academics
in the humanities.
</P>
<P>
   Showalter had stumbled across an old and obscure novel by Lynne
Cheney, who until recently was known mainly for her tenure as the
conservative chair of the National Endowment of the Humanities and
as a crusader against American educational decline,
multiculturalism and relativism. These days, she is best known for
being married to the Republican vice-presidential candidate, Dick
Cheney.
</P>
<P>
   The book, entitled ``Sisters,'' was printed in 1981 only in a
Signet Canadian paperback, Showalter said, and is now extremely
hard to find.
</P>
<P>
   In the typically hyperbolic language of romance novels, the
book's jacket promises the tale of Sophie Dymond, a beautiful,
strong-willed widow who leaves New York to investigate her sister's
death in Wyoming, and finds herself in a world ``where wives were
led to despise the marriage act and prostitutes pandered to
husbands' hungers ... where the relationship between women and men
became a kind of guerrilla warfare in which women were forced to
band together for the strength they needed and at times for the
love they wanted.''
</P>
<P>
   This week, in a scholarly review published in the Chronicle of
Higher Education, Showalter discussed what she considered some of
the more surprising aspects of ``Sisters,'' from its open-minded
attitudes toward feminism _ penned by an outspoken opponent of
women's studies programs _ to its deliciously Gothic plot elements.
</P>
<P>
   Lynne Cheney's brief biography on the official Bush campaign Web
site lists only two books to her credit: a history of the House of
Representatives she wrote with her husband, and ``Telling the
Truth,'' which argues that political correctness is breaking down
America's morality.
</P>
<P>
   She has also written two other novels, ``Executive Privilege''
in 1979 and ``The Body Politic,'' which was written with Victor
Gold in 1988 and concerns the wife of a dead vice president.
</P>
<P>
   But it is ``Sisters'' that dominates Showalter's review; she
said the book struck her in part because of the use it made of work
by several feminist historians. It showed knowledge of their work,
and also sympathy for 19th-century women's advocates, she said.
</P>
<P>
   In an interview this week, Lynne Cheney said she wrote the book
while her husband was running for Congress and said her goal was
``to write a thriller set in the 19th-century West.''
</P>
<P>
   But she had another goal too. ``In the 1970s feminists did
important work recovering women's history,'' she said. ``I tried to
do some of that myself.''
</P>
<P>
   In the book, Sophie Dymond is described as a successful magazine
publisher so savvy and strong-minded she carries about a little
lacquer box of contraceptives. She comes to Cheyenne, Wyo., in 1886
to find out how her sister Helen had died. As Showalter writes,
Sophie comes upon a group of women who are convinced of female
moral superiority and the value of powerful woman-to-woman bonds of
friendship, and she comes to understand their grievances even as
she rejects their ``lesbian ardor.''
</P>
<P>
   In one passage Showalter pointed out, Sophie watches two women
embrace in a wagon. ``She saw that the women in the cart had a
passionate, loving intimacy forever closed to her. How strong it
made them. What comfort it gave.''
</P>
<P>
   What really struck her, Showalter said, was that Mrs. Cheney
``approaches these issues in a very open-minded way, and a way very
sympathetic to the women and very sympathetic to the feminist
arguments.''
</P>
<P>
   But those qualities apparently did not appeal much to the book
buyers of the early 1980s.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think `Sisters' sold about 500 copies,'' Mrs. Cheney said.
``I hope the renewed interest in it will send it flying off the
shelves.''

   I feel a certain undeniable pride that women have taken control
of the two great male preserves of America _ politics and sports _
and ruined them.
</P>
<P>
   We finally quit fretting about piddly all-male bastions like the
Century Club and the Senate and started tearing down the very
pillars of masculinity. We are shaping the Olympics and the
presidential race _ and now we are even redecorating the
steakhouses, with silk and velvet and pink light bulbs.
</P>
<P>
   We have draped the gray steel of our leading warrior rituals in
yards and yards of chintz. We have made them so mawkish, so
hideously fluffy, so sentimental, kissy and fraught with personal
travail, that these gladiatorial contests play more like those old
Bette Davis/Joan Crawford weepies.
</P>
<P>
   This used to be guy season. Aggressive, muscular warfare focused
on winning and losing, stats, handicapping, training, strategy and
impenetrable debates on the modernization of the land-based leg of
the nuclear triad.
</P>
<P>
   Now it's girl season, soaking in sentiment, soap opera, romantic
walks along the lake, long, deep kisses on stage and guys making
Cher-like hair and wardrobe changes.
</P>
<P>
   The pols and TV execs have decided that what women want is to be
cuddled.
</P>
<P>
   In Sydney, NBC commentators get misty over a Kenyan mountain
biker's ``sad eyes,'' made so by the disappearance of his brother
into the woods in 1996. They laud the courage of the horse that
competed despite heart trouble, neighing in the face of danger.
They gush over Michael Johnson's flashing gold shoes and Elena
Prodounova's elaborately styled eyebrows. They muse that Alexei
Nemov's heart is not in Sydney, that this is ``not his everything
anymore,'' because he missed ``the first glimpse of his baby boy.''
And oh, the injuries and maladies: heart arrhythmia, chronic
fatigue syndrome, exercise-induced asthma.
</P>
<P>
   Why they keep wasting all that time with the actual contests is
beyond me. Why not just stop at the gorgeous shots of half-naked
athletes bathed in golden light, as solemn narrators describe their
triumphs over heart-wrenching adversity?
</P>
<P>
   NBC was worried that it went soft in 1996. So this time it
raised its reporting standards. ``We went out of our way,'' Dick
Ebersol, president of the network's sports division, told Newsweek,
``to substantially upgrade the disease, the injuries, the
life-threatening moments that qualify.''
</P>
<P>
   They've turned the Olympics into ``General Hospital.'' I keep
waiting for an update on the condition of the ``Agony of Defeat''
guy.
</P>
<P>
   After years of talking down to us in politics and sports,
instructing us on whom to root for, men finally figured out that
women are the uber-shoppers. We control the ballot and the clicker.
</P>
<P>
   We are the new party bosses. Our rooms are perfumed, not
smoke-filled, but we are the vetters. Even in the arena now, the
men approach on bended knee, proffering posies. Our questions are
quite different from those once asked by the Council on Foreign
Relations and the AFL-CIO. Are they good kissers? Doting hubbies
and dads? Fun-loving?
</P>
<P>
   Some of my girlfriends moan that they feel ashamed, that women
have trivialized the political race and diminished themselves by
responding to such goop. (At least the gauzy Olympics aren't
getting good ratings.)
</P>
<P>
   One convention smooch sent the women scurrying over to Al Gore's
side. Then one teary little chat with Oprah about his wife's
difficult pregnancy and his love of peanut butter and jelly
sandwiches sent the women scampering back to W.
</P>
<P>
   W. and Laura went on Larry King on Tuesday night and Al and
Tipper are going on Thursday night _ a connubial face-off to see
Who Loves His Wife More, and More Openly.
</P>
<P>
   Sure, it can all be a little much. But it has to count as
progress in our gender games.
</P>
<P>
   Alan Dundes, a folklorist and professor of anthropology at
Berkeley, has written that through history the essential theme of
all competitions has been this: ``One male demonstrates his
virility, his masculinity, at the expense of a male opponent. One
proves one's maleness by feminizing one's opponent.''
</P>
<P>
   Now, to win, men have to feminize themselves. Game over.

HEMOPHILIA DRUG WILL REQUIRE APPLICATIONS 
</HEADLINE>
  
(ATTN: Mich., Mo., Minn.)  By MELODY PETERSEN   
c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Unable to manufacture enough of a new drug for hemophiliacs, the
Bayer Corp. has taken the unusual step of asking patients to apply
for the drug through a corporate program rather than getting it
from a pharmacy or another distributor.
</P>
<P>
   Under the company's new program, patients will fill out an
application, including details of their medical history and their
insurance coverage, and submit it with a prescription. If the
patient is accepted, the program will deliver the new drug,
Kogenate FS, directly to the patients. The first ones approved will
get the drug first, with others put on a waiting list.
</P>
<P>
   Bayer and doctors who treat hemophiliacs expect that, for the
foreseeable future, demand for the new drug will greatly exceed the
amount of Kogenate FS the company is able to make.
</P>
<P>
   The new drug is a synthetic, genetically engineered version of
the naturally occurring coagulation protein that is missing or
deficient in people with hemophilia A, a condition affecting about
14,000 Americans. It can cost patients as much as $150,000 a year,
according to the National Hemophilia Foundation, the nation's
largest advocacy group for hemophiliacs.
</P>
<P>
   Bayer executives said they set up the unusual program because
they did not want extra inventory of the drug held at pharmacies
when it was in short supply.
</P>
<P>
   ``We believe that we are pioneering and finding a novel
alternative to a distribution system that does not work,'' said
Terry Tenbrunsel, vice-president of sales and marketing at Bayer's
American operations.
</P>
<P>
   But the company's new distribution program has angered doctors
and advocates for hemophiliacs at the foundation. Leaders of the
foundation said there is already a shortage of the two other
synthetic versions of the drugs, known as blood-clotting factors.
</P>
<P>
   The foundation's leaders said they feared that Bayer would
accept patients based on the strength of their insurance coverage,
which could leave out poor people on Medicaid and those without
insurance.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is going to be about who has the best insurance,'' said
Stephen E. Bajardi, the foundation's executive director.
</P>
<P>
   But Bayer denied those allegations. Tenbrunsel said the program
would evaluate the patients' applications and verify the insurance
coverage just as a pharmacy or a home-care company would.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is a blind process,'' he said. ``It doesn't matter what is
the basis of your insurance coverage.''
</P>
<P>
   Stephen W. Schondelmeyer, a professor of pharmaceutical
economics at the University of Minnesota, said Bayer's new program,
known as Bayer Direct, is unusual for the drug industry, but not
unique.
</P>
<P>
   Schondelmeyer said that when some early AIDS drugs were first
approved, the drug companies distributed them through a limited
number of mail-order companies. He said the program did not appear
unreasonable as long as it was used only in the short term. Over
the longer term, the company should be able to find a way to meet
demand, he said, and the regular distribution system should be
used.
</P>
<P>
   ``This limits the marketplace from working,'' Schondelmeyer
said. ``Consumers can't go look for the drug at pharmacies and
hospitals and get a better deal.''
</P>
<P>
   Kogenate FS is the new version of Bayer's Kogenate, a synthetic
clotting factor that has been sold for several years, and will be
priced similarly, Bayer said. Kogenate, which will be phased out,
and another synthetic clotting factor, made by Baxter, have been
popular with hemophiliacs because older drugs were made with human
blood. In the 1980s, many people with hemophilia contracted
hepatitis C, a potentially fatal liver infection, while taking the
old drugs. Many also contracted HIV.
</P>
<P>
   While Kogenate was a synthetic drug, it still contained albumin,
a human protein that comes from blood. The new drug, Kogenate FS,
contains 1,000 times less albumin than Kogenate, which the company
says will reduce the potential risk of transmitting viruses to the
patient.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Jeanne Lusher, a pediatric hematologist at the Children's
Hospital of Michigan, said many patients now get their drugs
through one of the companies that deliver drugs directly to homes.
``That has worked very well,'' said Lusher, who also sits on the
foundation's board. ``This new program is really frightening to
some patients.''
</P>
<P>
   Bayer has hired Express Scripts, a pharmacy benefit management
company in Maryland Heights, Mo., to process the applications and
deliver the drug. Bayer says that its factory, working 24 hours
each day, can now produce enough of the drug for about 700 people.
Bayer said it had applied to the Food and Drug Administration to
double the capacity of certain equipment in the factory, which
would let the company double the supply of the drug.

 &HT;    UT study yields diabetes information
 &HT;    By Mary Ann Roser
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ A 19-year study of adult diabetics in Texas has
led to a surprising breakthrough: a gene carrying seemingly useless
``junk DNA'' makes some people likely diabetes targets.
</P>
<P>
   The discovery of the mutated gene, described in an article today
in Nature Genetics, opens new pathways for preventing the disease
and possibly treating some of the nation's 15 million diabetics.
Diabetes, feared because it can lead to strokes, blindness, heart
disease, limb amputations and kidney disease, is the seventh
leading cause of death in the United States. And Texas has a bigger
problem than most other states.
</P>
<P>
   The gene carrying the junk DNA is ``not quite as junky as we
thought it was,'' said Craig Hanis, a biology professor at the
University of Texas Health Science Center at Houston. Hanis, who
works in the school's Human Genetics Center, collaborated with
Graeme Bell, a University of Chicago professor who led the study's
international team. They discovered the gene, named CAPN10, on
chromosome 2.
</P>
<P>
   They also found that the gene produces a protein called calpain
that could play a significant role in treating diabetes, Hanis
said.
</P>
<P>
   The newly identified gene interacts with other genes and
lifestyle factors, such as diet and exercise, making some people
more prone to adult-onset, or type-2, diabetes. Type-2 is the form
diagnosed in 90 percent to 95 percent of diabetics.
</P>
<P>
   ``Just because you have a particular form of the gene does not
mean you're not going to develop diabetes,'' Hanis said. ``You have
an increased risk.''
</P>
<P>
   One in 10 Texans has the disease, a proportion significantly
higher than the national rate of one in 17 Americans. The disease
also is several times more prevalent _ and more deadly _ to African
Americans and Mexican Americans than to whites.
</P>
<P>
   The gene also is more common in Mexican Americans and Pima
Indians, but Hanis expects to find it across ethnic and racial
groups.
</P>
<P>
   The Texas researchers studied a group of Mexican Americans in
Starr County, Texas' poorest county, where about 98 percent of the
population is of Mexican heritage. About half of the population has
diabetes or has a family member who does, Hanis said. Health care
workers are seeing type-2 diabetes, normally diagnosed in adults in
their 40s or older, striking children as young as 8.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's scary,'' said Maria Ofelia Saenz, who is 70 and lives in
Rio Grande City. Saenz took part in the study and has three sisters
and several aunts with diabetes. She knows others, too.
</P>
<P>
   ``My mother-in-law was a diabetic and she died of complications.
She had one leg amputated,'' Saenz said. ``I have friends on
dialysis. I get scared.''
</P>
<P>
   Saenz takes medicine to control diabetes, which produces high
levels of sugar in the blood. People with diabetes have defects in
the body's ability to produce or secrete insulin, but scientists
are just beginning to learn why.
</P>
<P>
   People with the mutant gene can reduce the risk of getting
diabetes by exercising and eating fewer fats, salts and sugars,
said Sharon Brown, UT-Austin's associate vice president for
research. Brown works with Hanis' study group to improve their
lifestyles.
</P>
<P>
   Hilda Guerra, a nurse and field manager of the Starr County
study office, said when she started with the study 19 years ago,
Starr County had no kidney dialysis centers. Now it has four, she
said.
</P>
<P>
   Guerra said she was grateful to the community for taking part in
the study and was thrilled by the discovery.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's wonderful,'' she said. ``Once you know what you're
targeting, you can get them better medication.''
</P>
<P>
   Those treatments, however, are probably five to 10 years away,
said Catherine McKeon, senior adviser for genetic research at the
National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a major discovery,'' said McKeon, manager of the
institute's $3.5 million grant to the researchers. ``It leads us to
a new set of genes ... in places to look that we haven't looked
before.''
</P>
<P>
   Researchers had not previously looked at junk DNA for a diabetes
susceptibility gene, Hanis said. This particular gene, which
carries DNA that was not believed to have any role in regulating
the body, was found to be a commonly mutated gene that can change
how other genes perform. Humans, who have nearly 3 billion units of
DNA, are 99.9 percent similar. But changes in the DNA sequence
cause mutations and produce variations among people.
</P>
<P>
   Bell and one of his colleagues, Nancy Cox, developed an analytic
technique that pinpointed the gene in 1998. But because the finding
was so unexpected, Nature Genetics asked the researchers to confirm
it with other studies.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now we know there is a genetic susceptibility to diabetes in
every population, and finding the genes that underlie that
susceptibility ... is the challenge that faces us,'' Hanis said.
``What we've done today is knocked one down.''

RECKONINGS :  A DROP IN THE BARREL? 
</HEADLINE>
   By PAUL KRUGMAN   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   The decision to release part of our Strategic Petroleum Reserve
has been widely criticized. Even many commentators with no ax to
grind seem convinced that there is something irresponsible about
the move.
</P>
<P>
   But they're wrong. We  &UR; should &LR;  be tapping our oil reserves; in
fact, the big mistake was not using them months ago.
</P>
<P>
   Put it this way: Why has OPEC, derided as irrelevant only two
years ago, suddenly become so effective again? The answer is that
now, as in the oil crises of 1973-4 and 1979-80, circumstances have
given OPEC what amounts to a temporary corner on the world oil
market. Our long-run policy should be to encourage production and
discourage consumption, so this doesn't happen again. But in the
meantime we should try to prevent OPEC from taking full advantage
of that corner. Releasing oil reserves to set a cap on prices _ and
making it clear that we are prepared to release more _ will do
exactly that.
</P>
<P>
   Successful attempts to corner markets are rare, but they happen.
A Japanese company managed to corner the entire world copper market
in the mid-1990s (though it lost it all by overplaying its hand).
The standard procedure is to surreptitiously buy up a large part of
the supply of your chosen commodity, then pull some of that supply
off the market, causing prices to soar for the rest. In effect, the
market manipulator creates a temporary monopoly position for
himself _ the market corner _ and exploits that temporary monopoly
by selling some but not all of his stockpile at very high prices.
</P>
<P>
   OPEC did not follow the classic procedure, but events have
produced much the same result. Very low oil prices a few years ago
discouraged independent producers; oil exploration fell off
sharply. Then demand for oil surged as Asia recovered from its
financial crisis and Americans bought ever more SUVs. The result is
that for the time being, even with non-OPEC production at maximum,
a few major exporting nations know that they have enormous market
power. By producing a few hundred thousand barrels a day less than
they could, they can drive prices on the oil they  &UR; do &LR;  produce to
levels not seen in many years.
</P>
<P>
   This situation won't last indefinitely. As long as we don't do
something foolish like encourage consumption by cutting taxes on
gasoline, new supplies of oil, together with falling demand in
response to high prices, will eventually eliminate that market
power. Until then the oil exporters have us, yes, over a barrel,
and are exploiting their temporary advantage with gusto.
</P>
<P>
   But if withholding a few hundred thousand barrels a day from the
market can drive prices sky-high, putting a similar amount back in
can bring them back down to earth _ as demonstrated by the sharp
drop in oil prices that followed the announcement of plans to tap
U.S. strategic reserves. And Western governments have more than a
billion barrels in reserve. Why not use those reserves to break the
market corner, or at least to limit its effectiveness?
</P>
<P>
   Some warn that if we supply more oil, OPEC will supply less.
Indeed, Libya's oil minister made that threat explicit Tuesday. But
the logic of the situation suggests that this threat isn't
credible. Oil producers know that they are getting higher prices
for their oil now than they will in a year or two; the only reason
they are not pumping as much as they can is that they believe that
holding back will keep prices high. But if they know that attempts
to drive up prices by restricting production will be offset by
increased releases from Western reserves, they will have less, not
more, reason to keep oil off the market. A credible promise
(threat?) to use our petroleum reserves to prevent prices from
going too high might well actually persuade OPEC to produce more
than it otherwise would.
</P>
<P>
   Remember that we're not talking about fundamental market forces
here. This market is already being manipulated by a handful of
exporting-nation governments _ so why shouldn't the
importing-nation governments also enter the game? We have a lot of
influence over this market, if we choose to use it. And it would be
not just a shame, but positively shameful, if we allow ourselves to
be deterred from acting in our own interest because we're afraid to
annoy the oil cartel.  &QL;

 &HT;    CONSERVATION GROUP HONORS TURNER
 &HT;    By KAVITA KUMAR
 &HT;    c.2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The League of Conservation Voters presented CNN
founder Ted Turner with a lifetime achievement award Tuesday night
to recognize his stewardship of the environment.
</P>
<P>
   ``If anyone were going to compile a list of environmental heroes
in the world, one giant on that list would surely be Ted Turner,''
said Deb Callahan, president of the national environmental
organization.
</P>
<P>
   ``Not only as a philanthropist has he done so much,'' Callahan
said, ``but he made CNN the voice in the mainstream media for
environmental and conservation issues.''
</P>
<P>
   As president of the Turner Foundation, Turner has given $50
million annually in grants to organizations that work for clean
water, clean air, renewable and efficient energy use, wildlife
protection and policies to reduce population growth.
</P>
<P>
   Through his funding of the United Nations Foundation, Turner has
also shed light on issues of sustainable energy and protecting
ecosystems and the biodiversity they contain.
</P>
<P>
   In introducing her father, Laura Turner Seydel remembered how
when she was growing up, he refused to install air conditioning in
their home, even during the brutal Southern summers.
</P>
<P>
   He taught her to pull weeds out by the roots with her hands when
she was just 7 or 8 years old, she recalled. And when driving in
the car, he would stop 10 times in a half hour to pick up a piece
of trash from the side of the road.
</P>
<P>
   ``He really walks the walk and talks the talk,'' Seydel said.
</P>
<P>
   Accepting his award before the crowd of 350, Turner said the
world is at a critical time in its development.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have information through global communications and the
Internet. And if we don't make it, we only have ourselves to blame,
because we have all the information we need to make it through,''
he said.
</P>
<P>
   Turner touched on the wide disparities between the rich and
poor, reducing military budgets, ridding the world of nuclear
weapons, the overzealousness with which the U.S. guards its border
with Mexico, and the need for family planning to control the
rapidly increasing world population.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have a huge challenge _ but we're up to it,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``And senators,'' he said, addressing the officials in the room,
``something that really bothers me is all of the trash along the
roads. If every state had deposit laws, all the poor people could
pick it up and make money doing it.''

LINDLAND'S LEGACY WILL BE GRASP OF LAW
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By KAREN CROUSE  
 c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   &LR; SYDNEY, Australia _ Remember Matt Lindland's name. You'll be
hearing it long after people have forgotten who defeated the U.S.
Greco-Roman wrestler in the 2000 Olympic final in the 167.5-pound
weight class.
</P>
<P>
   Lindland might have lost the war Tuesday to Russia's Mourat
Kardanov, but he won a battle to get here that you can bet will be
fought over and over in the coming quadrenniums.
</P>
<P>
   The 30-year-old from Lincoln, Neb., is to the U.S. Olympic
movement what Spencer Haywood was to underclassmen's flight to the
NBA, what Andy Messersmith was to baseball free agency, what Alan
Bakke was to reverse discrimination.
</P>
<P>
   Lindland lost in the final at the U.S. Trials to Keith Sieracki
and appealed the result, arguing that Sieracki had used an illegal
leg hold to win the match.
</P>
<P>
   A United States Olympic Committee arbitrator upheld Sieracki's
victory. Lindland, undeterred, unleashed his case on the U.S.
courts, which ruled in his favor (Sieracki, in a desperate last
move, appealed to the U. S. Supreme Court, which upheld the earlier
decision).
</P>
<P>
   For months, Lindland and the USOC were like Lindland and
Kardanov at the end of the gold-medal match: each was stubbornly
holding his ground, but neither was scoring any points.
</P>
<P>
   At length, a wrestle-off was held between Sieracki and Lindland,
which Lindland won 8-0. By that point, U.S. wrestling officials
could have been forgiven for wishing they had hand-picked their
Olympic team the way it is done in most other countries.
</P>
<P>
   Then again, U.S. softball did select its team after a protracted
tryout period and still was forced by a federal arbitrator to twice
juggle its Olympic roster after three players appealed the
selection process.
</P>
<P>
   Welcome to the U.S. Olympic movement in the 21st century, where
a top-rate lawyer is the next best thing to a top-rate coach (or,
we're finding out, a top-rate pharmacist).
</P>
<P>
   Just to be safe, U.S. Wrestling took two separate Olympic team
pictures before shoving off for the Summer Games _ one with
Lindland in the frame and the other with Sieracki.
</P>
<P>
   Wrestling prides itself on being a family, and sure enough, the
world is seeing it here in all its clannish dysfunction. The USOC
so wished Lindland would disappear, it left him out of its daily
newsletter Tuesday. Early deadlines and all that, we were told.
</P>
<P>
   And yet, asked late Tuesday afternoon what time Lindland was
scheduled to wrestle for the gold medal, the USOC camp continued to
draw a collective blank. We might as well have been asking when the
Swede Mikael Ljungberg was due to compete.
</P>
<P>
   The fact is, the U.S. team is divided into camps, much like the
Republicans were in the early months of the presidential primaries.
</P>
<P>
   ``There were a lot of emotional highs and lows,'' U.S. wrestling
coach Dan Chandler said, alluding to a rift, ``but the team handled
it well.''
</P>
<P>
   Lindland had a vocal following for his final. Early in the first
half of the six-minute championship match, a rousing chant of
``USA'' started in the stands.
</P>
<P>
   In the second minute, Kardanov got Lindland in a vulnerable
position and in a flurry of moves turned him. In a matter of
seconds the Russian was ahead 3-0. Lindland managed to lift his
Russian opponent off the floor in the fifth minute but couldn't
convert his advantage into any points.
</P>
<P>
   ``He got on top early when we were dry and I got on top late
when we were wet,'' Lindland said later. ``He defended when I tried
to turn him.''
</P>
<P>
   Lindland then defended the route he took to these Games.
</P>
<P>
   ``Things went the way they did,'' he said. ``I got here because
I'm a better wrestler than Keith is.''
</P>
<P>
   Lindland wasn't oblivious to the furor he created. ``I'm sorry I
had to get on the team that way,'' he said. ``I don't know if
anybody tried to dissuade me, but they sure fought hard. Their
position was the winner of the match at the Trials should stand.''
</P>
<P>
   If he's getting any cold shoulders from the U.S. Olympic family,
Lindland has enough warmth from his immediate family to get him
through the week.
</P>
<P>
   As Lindland spoke to reporters outside the interview room, he
was bouncing his daughter Robin, 6, in his arms. His son James, 8,
was tugging at the wrestler's sweat pants, his daddy's silver medal
wrapped around his neck. Wife Angie stood off to the side, holding
Lindland's award bouquet and smiling.
</P>
<P>
   An American Greco-Roman wrestler had never won an Olympic medal
in the welterweight division. So Lindland made history at these
Games in more ways than one.
</P>
<P>
   ``My goal all along was just to get the gold medal,'' Lindland
said. ``I just wanted to be the best on one day. I'm the
second-best. I came up short.''
</P>
<P>
   He won in court, though, and that's how we're sure he's destined
to be remembered.

CLINTON PRAISES THE BRAVE VOTERS OF YUGOSLAVIA
</HEADLINE>
  By JANE PERLEZ   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Surprised by the sweep of the vote for the
opposition presidential candidate in Yugoslavia, but cautious about
gloating, President Clinton praised the ``brave people'' there on
Tuesday for choosing change and sought to embolden them by offering
to lift economic sanctions if they prevail.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton, who has dealt with President Slobodan Milosevic of
Yugoslavia as a noxious central character in foreign policy
throughout his presidency, warned that although Milosevic has lost
legitimacy he may try to ``cling to power at the expense of his
people.''
</P>
<P>
   Despite the public wariness, born of watching Milosevic
manipulate his way out of seemingly impossible corners, the Clinton
administration has concluded that he has finally lost his magic.
</P>
<P>
   No longer is Milosevic invincible in the eyes of his people,
senior administration officials said, noting that signs of fissures
within Milosevic's ruling circle spelled the beginning of the end.
</P>
<P>
   Telling evidence of paralysis is appearing within the regime,
these officials said. Student leaders, who had been arrested and
harassed before the election, have been left alone by the police
and the military in the last 48 hours. The barrage of official
propaganda over state media has virtually ground to a halt as
various acolytes of Milosevic have given varying accounts of the
vote tally, creating a picture of confusion in the inner sanctum.
</P>
<P>
   And the decision on Tuesday by Milosevic to call a second round
of voting on Oct. 8 was interpreted by administration officials as
a desperate effort to buy time.
</P>
<P>
   The fact that Milosevic did not announce an outright victory
means that he either failed to set up a sufficiently swift scheme
to steal votes or that he would have had to steal too many to make
a credible claim, officials said. In contrast to Milosevic's weak
election operation, the opposition movement managed to organize a
fast parallel vote count, enabling them to announce a 54.7 percent
victory for their candidate, Vojislav Kostunica, over Milosevic's
35 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Milosevic's forces announced on Tuesday that preliminary results
showed he had finished second with 40 percent, and the opposition
had won with 48 percent. With neither side reaching more than 50
percent, a runoff was needed, the government said.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton administration officials said they hoped that in the
next two weeks the opposition would create even more of a steam
roller and that Milosevic would not be able to withstand.
</P>
<P>
   But it is also possible, Balkan experts in the administration
said, that Milosevic could try to cut a deal with Kostunica. And it
is conceivable, given his past behavior, that Milosevic could
create some kind of crisis: either an intervention in Montenegro,
the smaller republic in Yugoslavia, where the leadership boycotted
the election _ or a cancellation of the election altogether.
</P>
<P>
   And as they assessed the uncertain situation in Belgrade and
other urban centers, the administration tried to weave a delicate
balance between showing support for the opposition, which it helped
finance, and keeping a distance so as not to offend Yugoslavia's
voters.
</P>
<P>
   Kostunica, a proud Serbian nationalist, is stridently
anti-American and has repeatedly said that if he came to power he
would not allow Milosevic, who has been indicted for war crimes by
the tribunal in the Hague, to be handed over for trial. He has
strongly criticized the West's war in Kosovo and the presence of
NATO peacekeepers there.
</P>
<P>
   Extending a hand of friendship to the opposition _ and urging it
to keep its courage _ Clinton said in a speech at Georgetown
University Law Center that Serbia, the dominant republic in
Yugoslavia, would have much to gain with a change of power.
</P>
<P>
   ``If the will of the people is respected, the doors to Europe
and the world will be open again to Serbia,'' Clinton said. ``We
will take steps with our allies to lift economic sanctions and the
people of Serbia who have suffered so much finally will have a
chance to lead normal lives. I hope that day is arriving.''
</P>
<P>
   But he also acknowledged differences with the opposition, whose
forces benefited in the last year from $25 million in support from
the Clinton administration.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am under no illusions that a new government in Serbia would
automatically lead to a rapprochement between the two of us, and
any new leader of Serbia should pursue, first and foremost, the
interests of its own people,'' Clinton said.
</P>
<P>
   In Europe, the support for the opposition was unequivocal. The
French foreign minister, Hubert Vedrine, said that France, as the
current president of the European Union, would reward an opposition
victory with the rapid lifting of sanctions.
</P>
<P>
   ``The hour of change has struck in Belgrade,'' Vedrine said.
``Something has begun with this vote which is no longer to be
stopped.''
</P>
<P>
   In what administration officials saw as an encouraging sign, the
German Chancellor, Gerhard Schroeder, persuaded the Russian
president, Vladimir V. Putin, to join him in a statement in Moscow
on Monday that stressed the vitality of the Serbian opposition and
the democratic process.
</P>
<P>
   If Russia can be removed from Milosevic's camp, then his
isolation will be almost complete, officials here said. One of the
comfort factors that Milosevic has traditionally offered his top
cronies is the notion that there is always some major country for
them to turn to.
</P>
<P>
   The administration even took small cheer from the fact that
Milosevic invited election observers to come from China _ he
declined to accept them from anywhere else _ but that the Chinese
observers failed to show up.
</P>
<P>
   But as Clinton pointed out, there was no certainty that the
Yugoslav drama would end without violence.
</P>
<P>
   ``I do not underestimate Milosevic's desire to cling to power at
the expense of the people: I have witnessed it, lived with it and
responded to it first-hand,'' Clinton said, referring to the war in
Kosovo last year and NATO air raids in Bosnia in 1995.
</P>
<P>
   In some quarters, Milosevic's desire for a second round of
voting was seen as an effort to try to organize military and police
units that would fight, if necessary. ``His strategy has always
been: string them out and then beat them up,'' said one official,
recalling the scenes in 1991 when Milosevic called out tanks
against protesters in Belgrade.
</P>
<P>
   But nearly 10 years later, it seems that the Serbian people have
given more votes to a charismatic, single opposition leader,
Kostunica. And after four lost wars _ over Slovenia, Croatia,
Bosnia and Kosovo _ it seems that many in the military and the
police have voted for him.
</P>
<P>
   ``The question now is how Milosevic will go out and who he will
take out with him,'' said one administration official who has been
at the center of Balkans policy. ``Finally the people stood up.''

RESEARCHERS FIND GENE FOR TYPE 2 DIABETES
</HEADLINE>
  By NICHOLAS WADE    
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   A novel gene associated with development of Type 2, or
adult-onset, diabetes, a major and growing public health problem,
has been identified from study of Mexican-Americans in Starr
County, Texas, a population with an unusually heavy burden of the
disease.
</P>
<P>
   The finding, if confirmed, will be the first discovery of a gene
involved in the most common kind of Type 2 diabetes. Although some
5 percent of cases of the disease are caused by defects in single
genes, which are relatively easy to find, the most common kind of
Type 2 diabetes is thought to be caused by several contributing
genes.
</P>
<P>
   In multigenic diseases, which include many of the most common
afflictions like Alzheimer's, asthma, diabetes, heart disease and
schizophrenia, the contribution from every gene is so small that
each is hard to identify.
</P>
<P>
   To their surprise, the researchers at the University of Chicago
and the University of Texas Health Science Center at Houston found
the gene is one not known to have anything to do with sugar
metabolism, which is disturbed in diabetes. Its role is obscure,
they said, but once it is understood, it should reveal a new
biochemical pathway involved in diabetes.
</P>
<P>
   The diabetes finding has a broader significance in that the gene
is the first in a multigenic disease to have been identified by
scanning the whole genome _ the full complement of human DNA _ in a
systematic way.
</P>
<P>
   Though a few such genes have come to light through guesswork,
genomewide scans are the most promising method for uncovering the
roots of multigenic disease. The diabetes work was done mostly
before the human genome sequence became available, and such studies
should be much easier in future.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is the first published account of tracking down a DNA
sequence variation that appears to account for a multigenic
character'' by scanning the whole genome, said Dr. Francis Collins,
director of the National Human Genome Research Institute. ``It is a
pathway we hope to travel frequently, so it's a relief to see
someone has actually done it, albeit at great effort.''
</P>
<P>
   The Type 2 diabetes gene has been discovered through an
eight-year effort which involved comparing the DNA of patients and
their siblings unaffected by the disease.
</P>
<P>
   The gene has been named calpain-10 after a family of known genes
it resembles. Calpain-10 and other genes involved in its pathway
may provide new targets for drugs.
</P>
<P>
   The gene variations associated with diabetes were discovered
first among the Mexican-American families of Starr County, in South
Texas. They have since also been found, though at lower frequency,
in other ethnic groups, including the Pima Indians of Arizona, who
have the highest known incidence of Type 2 diabetes, and Europeans
from the Botnia region of Finland.
</P>
<P>
   The team of researchers who brought the gene variations to light
include Dr. Graeme I. Bell of the University of Chicago, who
directed the genetic analysis; his colleague Nancy J. Cox, who
devised the statistical tests to pinpoint the causative DNA
variations; and Dr. Craig L. Hanis, of the University of Texas
Health Science Center at Houston, who led the clinical analysis of
the Starr County patients. Their findings are published in
Wednesday's issue of the journal Nature Genetics.

HEMOPHILIA DRUG WILL REQUIRE APPLICATIONS 
</HEADLINE>
  (EDS: This article is part of TIMES EXPRESS. It is a condensed
version of a story that will appear in tomorrow's New York Times.) 
 By MELODY PETERSEN   
c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Unable to manufacture enough of a new drug for hemophiliacs, the
Bayer Corp. has taken the unusual step of asking patients to apply
for the drug through a corporate program rather than getting it
from a pharmacy or another distributor.
</P>
<P>
   Under the company's new program, patients will fill out an
application, including details of their medical history and their
insurance coverage, and submit it with a prescription. If the
patient is accepted, the program will deliver the new drug,
Kogenate FS, directly to the patients. The first ones approved will
get the drug first, with others put on a waiting list.
</P>
<P>
   Bayer and doctors who treat hemophiliacs expect that, for the
foreseeable future, demand for the new drug will greatly exceed the
amount of Kogenate FS the company is able to make.
</P>
<P>
   The new drug is a synthetic, genetically engineered version of
the naturally occurring coagulation protein that is missing or
deficient in people with hemophilia A, a condition affecting about
14,000 Americans. It can cost patients as much as $150,000 a year,
according to the National Hemophilia Foundation, the nation's
largest advocacy group for hemophiliacs.
</P>
<P>
   Bayer executives said they set up the unusual program because
they did not want extra inventory of the drug held at pharmacies
when it was in short supply.
</P>
<P>
   ``We believe that we are pioneering and finding a novel
alternative to a distribution system that does not work,'' said
Terry Tenbrunsel, vice-president of sales and marketing at Bayer's
American operations.
</P>
<P>
   But the company's new distribution program has angered doctors
and advocates for hemophiliacs at the foundation. Leaders of the
foundation said there is already a shortage of the two other
synthetic versions of the drugs, known as blood-clotting factors.
</P>
<P>
   The foundation's leaders said they feared that Bayer would
accept patients based on the strength of their insurance coverage,
which could leave out poor people on Medicaid and those without
insurance.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is going to be about who has the best insurance,'' said
Stephen E. Bajardi, the foundation's executive director.
</P>
<P>
   But Bayer denied those allegations.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is a blind process,'' he said. ``It doesn't matter what is
the basis of your insurance coverage.''
</P>
<P>
   Stephen W. Schondelmeyer, a professor of pharmaceutical
economics at the University of Minnesota, said Bayer's new program,
known as Bayer Direct, is unusual for the drug industry, but not
unique.
</P>
<P>
   Schondelmeyer said that when some early AIDS drugs were first
approved, the drug companies distributed them through a limited
number of mail-order companies. He said the program did not appear
unreasonable as long as it was used only in the short term. Over
the longer term, the company should be able to find a way to meet
demand, he said, and the regular distribution system should be
used.
</P>
<P>
   ``This limits the marketplace from working,'' Schondelmeyer
said. ``Consumers can't go look for the drug at pharmacies and
hospitals and get a better deal.''
</P>
<P>
   Kogenate FS is the new version of Bayer's Kogenate, a synthetic
clotting factor that has been sold for several years, and will be
priced similarly, Bayer said. Kogenate, which will be phased out,
and another synthetic clotting factor, made by Baxter, have been
popular with hemophiliacs because older drugs were made with human
blood. In the 1980s, many people with hemophilia contracted
hepatitis C, a potentially fatal liver infection, while taking the
old drugs. Many also contracted HIV.
</P>
<P>
   While Kogenate was a synthetic drug, it still contained albumin,
a human protein that comes from blood. The new drug, Kogenate FS,
contains 1,000 times less albumin than Kogenate, which the company
says will reduce the potential risk of transmitting viruses to the
patient.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Jeanne Lusher, a pediatric hematologist at the Children's
Hospital of Michigan, said many patients now get their drugs
through one of the companies that deliver drugs directly to homes.
``That has worked very well,'' said Lusher, who also sits on the
foundation's board. ``This new program is really frightening to
some patients.''
</P>
<P>
   Bayer has hired Express Scripts, a pharmacy benefit management
company in Maryland Heights, Mo., to process the applications and
deliver the drug. Bayer says that its factory, working 24 hours
each day, can now produce enough of the drug for about 700 people.
Bayer said it had applied to the Food and Drug Administration to
double the capacity of certain equipment in the factory, which
would let the company double the supply of the drug.

MICROSOFT, IN A TACTICAL VICTORY, GETS CASE RETURNED TO APPEALS
COURT 
</HEADLINE>
  (EDS: This article is part of TIMES EXPRESS. It is a condensed
version of a story that will appear in tomorrow's New York Times.) 
 By STEPHEN LABATON  
c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The Supreme Court handed a major tactical victory
to the Microsoft Corp. on Tuesday when it rejected the government's
plea to immediately hear the appeal of its landmark antitrust case
and instead returned the proceeding to the U.S. Court of Appeals
for the District of Columbia.
</P>
<P>
   The decision gives Microsoft greater breathing room to pursue
its appeals, relieves the company of any pressure to return any
time soon to the bargaining table and, in the absence of a
settlement, could have the effect of prolonging a final court
judgment by a year or longer.
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft executives applauded Tuesday's decision.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm happy that we're moving on with the process,'' said Steven
A. Ballmer, the chief executive of Microsoft, in an interview in
San Francisco. ``We are confident in our case on appeal.''
</P>
<P>
   For their part, Justice Department officials on Tuesday began
the process of preparing for a new round of court appearances. ``We
look forward to presenting our case to the court of appeals as
expeditiously as possible,'' said Gina Talamona, a department
spokeswoman.
</P>
<P>
   Before Tuesday's decision, the government had argued that the
case against Microsoft involved issues of ``immense importance to
our national economy,'' and had urged the Supreme Court to invoke a
rarely used procedural rule to bypass the appeals court, quickly
review the case and uphold the order issued by Federal District
Judge Thomas Penfield Jackson three months ago to slice Microsoft
into two smaller companies.
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft had opposed the government's request for immediate
Supreme Court review, saying it ``would impose an extraordinary
burden on the court'' and that there was no reason to depart from
the normal procedure of using the appeals court to narrow the
complex legal issues and voluminous trial record.
</P>
<P>
   On Tuesday, the Supreme Court agreed when it directed that the
case be sent to the court of appeals.
</P>
<P>
   Seven appeals court judges are to hear the proceeding. After
they deliberate over the next few months, they have a wide range of
options, including sending the case back to Jackson for further
proceedings consistent with their ruling, a process that could
further delay a final resolution.
</P>
<P>
   After the court of appeals rules, the case could still go to the
Supreme Court. But, since the Supreme Court is under no obligation
to review the eventual decision of the appeals court, that court
could have the last word, although that may not be known until some
time in 2001 or later.

KODAK STOCK PLUNGES 25 PERCENT ON SUDDEN DROP IN SALES 
</HEADLINE>
   By CLAUDIA H. DEUTSCH   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Eastman Kodak Co., citing a sudden and as-yet-unexplained sales
decline in every one of its businesses, warned investors Tuesday
that its third-quarter earnings would be as much as 25 cents a
share below expectations and that, if sales do not pick up,
fourth-quarter earnings might disappoint as well.
</P>
<P>
   ``After a strong August, we're seeing slowness everywhere,'' a
perplexed Robert H. Brust, Kodak's chief financial officer, told
analysts in a hastily arranged conference call Tuesday. ``We're
combing the woods to see what's causing this.''
</P>
<P>
   Brust said that third-quarter revenue would probably fall short
of expectations by $200 million to $300 million. Most troubling, he
said, the declines were coming at the tail end of September,
traditionally the strongest part of the quarter.
</P>
<P>
   No one seems certain if the drop is a one-time blip or a sign of
long-term woes, but investors clearly expect the worst. They sent
Kodak stock plunging $14.81 a share Tuesday, or 25 percent, to
$44.19, the lowest level in more than six years.
</P>
<P>
   Until Tuesday, Kodak had predicted earnings of $1.56 to $1.66 a
share, while the analysts' consensus was $1.60 a share.
</P>
<P>
   Many analysts lowered their earnings estimates for this year and
next by about 10 percent and pulled their buy recommendations off
the stock. ``There's clearly a loss of faith in the company,'' said
Charles L. Hill, director of research at First Call/Thompson
Financial.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts said that Kodak's announcement was particularly
shocking in that the mood among retailers at Photokina, the huge
photography exhibition in Germany that is held twice a year and
ended this week, was very upbeat.
</P>
<P>
   ``The sense we got is that demand is robust, and that Kodak's
third quarter seemed on track,'' said Jonathan Rosenzweig, an
analyst with Salomon Smith Barney.
</P>
<P>
   Theories were rife on Wall Street on Tuesday about what went
wrong. Some analysts suggested that high energy prices and the wet
summer had cut into consumer vacations, curtailing picture-taking.
</P>
<P>
   But others suggested that Kodak's retail customers were trying
to lower their inventories and might rush back with large orders in
October. They noted other photography-related companies were having
similar woes. For example, Lexmark International, which makes
photo-capable printers, also issued an earnings warning, partly
attributable to sluggish sales of inkjet printer cartridges.
</P>
<P>
   ``Trends don't change overnight, and people don't stop taking
pictures overnight,'' said Ulysses Yannas, an analyst with Buckman,
Buckman &AMP; Reid and one of the few to maintain a strong buy on Kodak
stock.
</P>
<P>
   Nor is there a universal pall over the photographic industry.
Stephen Giordano, the president of Digital Now Inc., which sells
equipment and software to convert photographs to digital images,
says he is seeing ``explosive growth'' in sales. ``Kodak's digital
business should be growing as fast as we are,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Fuji Photofilm USA recently told analysts that its film sales
were sluggish but its photographic paper sales were strong. And
Michelle Lampmann, an analyst for Infotrends Research Group, says
all digital cameras are selling well.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, until Tuesday, Kodak, which is based in Rochester, N.Y.,
seemed to be flying high, too. It had met or exceeded earnings
expectations in the last six quarters. It had not faced a price war
in film for a while, its digital losses had been greatly reduced,
and its cost-cutting programs were on track.
</P>
<P>
   It has also made headway in sales on the Internet. Just this
week it revamped its Web home page to look less corporate and more
like an Internet home for amateur photography enthusiasts. ``That
should really help them drive revenue from the Web,'' said Lia M.
Schubert, an internet research analyst at Infotrends.
</P>
<P>
   But Web sales and such will never offer Kodak the lush profit
margins of conventional film, and that means the company has less
leeway to combat setbacks. ``With a lower-margin mix of products,
film sales have to work even harder to make up for shortfalls,''
said Benjamin A. Reitzes, an analyst at PaineWebber. ``And that's
put a long-term cloud over the company.''
</P>
<P>
   In fact, Kodak's problems may be more macro than micro. Analysts
have told First Call that they expect sluggish third-quarter
earnings reports from retailers, too. And Jack L. Kelly, a

   ``Kodak's problems may represent just another dot to connect in
a picture of an economy that is slowing across the board,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   Whatever its cause, the sales decline could not have come at a
worse time for Kodak. Its raw materials prices have skyrocketed,
while a persistently weak euro caused a $50 million
currency-translation hit to third-quarter sales.
</P>
<P>
   Kodak's graphics business is struggling, as digital technologies
continue to supplant the need for Kodak films. Kodak's own digital
portfolio still loses money. And Fuji is doubling its capacity for
making films and papers in the United States early next year, a
move that many analysts expect might set off a price war.
</P>
<P>
   ``The sales decline has made it impossible for us to offset
these other issues,'' Brust said.

<P>
   Businesses owned by Latinas are a growing economic force, but
their use of traditional sources of capital has not grown in
proportion, according to a study released Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Spirit of Enterprise: Latina Entrepreneurs in the United
States'' study by the National Foundation of Women Business Owners
says nationwide there were 382,400 Latina-owned businesses
generating $67.3 billion in sales in 1996.
</P>
<P>
   The Latina market is actually the fastest growing market in the
small business sector, said Mary Rodrigues, spokeswoman for Wells
Fargo, which sponsored the study.
</P>
<P>
   ``We see this as a huge market,'' Rodrigues said.
</P>
<P>
   Between 1987 and 1996, the number of Latina-owned firms in the
United States grew by 206 percent; their sales rose 534 percent,
and their employment numbers grew 487 percent, the study found.
</P>
<P>
   Some 54 percent of Latinas surveyed started their businesses
with $10,000 or more, compared to 44 percent of all business
owners. Just over half of Latina entrepreneurs had bank credit.
</P>
<P>
   Bank capital carried by Latina business owners has not changed
drastically in the past two years. In 1998, 24 percent of Latinas
surveyed had less than $25,000 in capital available and 24 percent
had $100,000 or more. Today 22 percent have less than $25,000 and
29 percent have $100,000 or more, the study found.
</P>
<P>
   ``(Latinos) are a little more conservative and prefer to work on
internally generated capital, but you have the financial community
aggressively courting them,'' said Jack Kyser, chief economist for
the Los Angeles County Economic Development Corp.
</P>
<P>
   In 1996, California ranked first in the nation for Latina-owned
businesses, with 130,000 businesses that employed 148,400 people
and generated sales of nearly $17 billion.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is going to continue to be a very, very important
community,'' Kyser said.
</P>
<P>
   Wells Fargo has been particularly interested in Latina
businesses because of their fast rate of growth, Rodrigues said.
</P>
<P>
   Wells Fargo launched a Latino Loan Program three years ago with
a goal of lending $1 billion nationally to Latino men and women.
Last year the bank upped its goal to $3 billion over the next 10
years.
</P>
<P>
   ``At the end of 1999, we had loaned more than $500 million to
Latino business owners nationwide,'' Rodrigues said.
</P>
<P>
   Although many people think Latina businesses are new, the survey
found they have an average of 12 years in business, which makes
them considered less risky prospects for loans, Rodrigues said.
</P>
<P>
   Bruce Rosenthal, spokesman for the National Foundation for Women
Business Owners, pointed out that two-thirds of the survey
respondents were born in the United States.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were intrigued at how well-established Hispanic women are
as business owners,'' he said. ``They also retain some very strong
ties to their heritage and their families.''
</P>
<P>
   The foundation sees the study results as a kind of wake-up call.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are opportunities for Latina entrepreneurs to develop
their business plans and to approach banks with their business
needs. And it's also an opportunity for the banks,'' Rosenthal
said.

IN MICHIGAN, CHENEY IS SUDDENLY QUIET ON SCHOOL VOUCHER PLAN 
</HEADLINE>
   By MICHAEL COOPER   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   TROY, Mich. _ For weeks Dick Cheney, the Republican
vice-presidential nominee, has promoted the Bush campaign's plan to
take federal money away from failing public schools and give it to
parents to use on educational alternatives, a plan that Democrats
describe as a voucher system that would hurt public schools.
</P>
<P>
   But when Cheney came to Michigan this week _ a swing state where
a ballot initiative calling for a voucher system has become a
political minefield and drawn the opposition of the Republican
governor, John Engler _ he was virtually mum on the subject. He did
not mention it at all on Monday in a speech at an elementary school
in Traverse City, not even when he was asked to comment on vouchers
by a woman in the audience.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's for the state to decide,'' Cheney told the woman.
</P>
<P>
   Asked later why he did not mention the Bush plan, Cheney said
that he had taken the woman's question to refer to the Michigan
voucher proposal _ a debate the campaign does not wish to inject
itself in. And he said he simply did not have time to describe the
Bush plan.
</P>
<P>
   At nearly every other school stop Cheney has made, he has
promoted Gov. George W. Bush's plan, in which public schools that
fail to meet standards for three years in a row would lose their
federal Title I money, which is earmarked to educate poor and
disadvantaged students. The plan calls for giving the money to the
states, which would then give it to parents of the children in the
failing schools.
</P>
<P>
   The Bush campaign tends to avoid the term ``vouchers,'' which it
fears is politically loaded, preferring to think of the money as
``portable.''
</P>
<P>
   Asked why the campaign does not call the plan a voucher plan, he
said Tuesday: ``You can call it a voucher if you want, but it
relates to the federal funds. We haven't described it as a voucher;
it's really the most choice for the parent. They can spend it if
they want on a tutor; they can use it to send their kids to another
public school; they can use it for private school if that was their
wish.''

<P>
   &LR;  LOS ANGELES _ Cory Paus, after throwing the ball crisply and
accurately in practice Tuesday, was officially named the starting
quarterback for Saturday night's game at the Rose Bowl against
Arizona State by UCLA coach Bob Toledo.
</P>
<P>
   ``Cory's doing a nice job,'' Toledo said. ``He appears to be
throwing the ball pretty well. It's not a panic deal. I'm doing it
because he's our starting quarterback, he's healthy and ready to
play.''
</P>
<P>
   Paus, who beat out Ryan McCann in fall camp, suffered a
separated right throwing shoulder on the first play of the season
opener against Alabama. McCann quarterbacked the Bruins to wins
over Alabama, Fresno State and Michigan before they were beaten by
Oregon.
</P>
<P>
   Paus, who was cleared to begin practicing on Monday, said he is
close to where he was before the injury. For the most part, he
looked it Tuesday, displaying more pace and accuracy than McCann.
</P>
<P>
   ``At certain times, I don't have as much zip on the ball,'' Paus
said. ``There were a few throws today where I ran into a couple of
people and I felt fine. That was a major thing.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was a little less rusty today than yesterday and I'll be a
little less rusty tomorrow than I was today. You have to play full
speed and wing it, as coach (Al) Borges would say.''

ANOTHER SUIT AGAINST WORLDCOM 
 &HT;     BY TODD WALLACK
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     c.2000 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
WorldCom Inc., the nation's second-largest long-distance company,
promised customers 10 free minutes with a new calling card _ then
billed them for the calls anyway, according to a lawsuit filed
Tuesday.
<P>
   The class-action suit, filed in U.S. District Court in Los
Angeles, contends that ``many thousands'' of current and former
customers were affected.
</P>
<P>
   George Cuza of Los Angeles, for instance, received an ``MCI
WorldCom'' calling card late last year with a bright gold sticker
labeled: ``Your 10 Minutes Free.''
</P>
<P>
   The card included a written promotion promising that he would
``automatically get up to 10 FREE minutes'' on his first bill
whether he called someone in the United States or overseas.
</P>
<P>
   But after making eight one-minute calls in October, WorldCom
billed him $6.06 for the calls. WorldCom never gave him a credit
for the free minutes, the suit contends.
</P>
<P>
   Similarly, Ky Du, who also lives in Los Angeles, also received a
calling card with the promise of 10 free minutes. But Du was billed
$1.58 for her first one-minute call in October, and was billed
$9.46 for three more short calls.
</P>
<P>
   Harry Rebhuhn, one of the lawyers who filed the case, said he
signed up with WorldCom himself to find out if the problem was more
widespread.
</P>
<P>
   After receiving a calling card with the gold sticker, he said he
made a 9.5-minute call to Germany. He was billed $23.06. Like Cuza
and Du, he never received a credit for 10 minutes.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know one person who got the credit without demanding
it,'' Rebhuhn said. But Rebhuhn said he isn't sure yet how many
people were affected and how much money they lost. ``It could be a
significantly large sum of money. It could be relatively low.''
</P>
<P>
   WorldCom spokesman Leland Prince declined to comment.
</P>
<P>
   A similar case was filed in federal court last year, Rebhuhn
said. But that case was dropped because WorldCom hadn't filed any
documents with the Federal Communications Commission at the time,
outlining the promotion. (Under an arcane legal doctrine governing
telecommunications companies, firms are required to charge the
rates listed with federal regulators _ even if they promise
customers a better deal.)
</P>
<P>
   Rebhuhn said he believes this case can now go forward because
WorldCom has since notified regulators about the ``10 free
minutes'' offer.
</P>
<P>
   This is just the latest in a string of consumer lawsuits to hit
the company. California and five other states sued WorldCom in July
for a litany of charges, ranging from deceptive advertising to
switching customers' service without permission.
</P>
<P>
   And last month, Girard &AMP; Green in San Francisco and the Utility
Consumers' Action Network in San Diego accused WorldCom of billing
people for local phone service _ even after they switched to
another company, like Pacific Bell.
</P>
<P>
   ``Once again, we have a telephone company billing for more than
advertised,'' said Chris Witteman, a lawyer with the Greenlining
Institute, a San Francisco consumer group, which has been critical
of the industry in general.
</P>
<P>
   ``Neither the courts nor the (state) Public Utilities Commission
have been effective in stopping this rampant abuse of the
consumer,'' he said.

SAN FRANCISCO IS NO. 1 _ OR NO. 32  &HT;     BY PETER SINTON
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     c.2000 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
San Francisco is often smug about its climate and other natural
charms.
<P>
   The local convention and visitors bureau touts the city as
``everybody's favorite'' and this past weekend it once again topped
the list of Conde Nast Traveler magazine's top U.S. cities.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier this month, readers of Travel &AMP; Leisure magazine gave
San Francisco the edge over New York and London as their favorite
city in the world thanks to its ``red-hot restaurant scene and
booming economy.''
</P>
<P>
   Last November, Money magazine chose San Francisco as ``the best
place to live'' among the 300 biggest U.S. metropolitan areas.
</P>
<P>
   But as many Olympic stars in Sydney have discovered, clean
sweeps are difficult to achieve.
</P>
<P>
   In the seventh-annual ranking of the best U.S. cities for small
business by Dun &AMP; Bradstreet and Entrepreneur magazine, released
Friday, San Francisco placed a distant 32 out of 60 large
metropolitan areas.
</P>
<P>
   The gold, silver and bronze were won by Fort Worth-Arlington,
Texas; West Palm Beach-Boca Raton, Fla.; and Raleigh-Durham-Chapel
Hill, N.C., respectively.
</P>
<P>
   The best showing by a big Northern California city was San Jose
(No. 15), followed by Sacramento (No. 29), San Francisco and
Oakland (No. 47).
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm surprised by the results; the economy is about as robust
as one could ask for and it seems to me we have numerous
entrepreneurial startups,'' said John Marks, president of the San
Francisco Convention and Visitors Bureau.
</P>
<P>
   ``When it comes to surveys,'' he added lightheartedly, ``my
reaction is to brag a little when we come out on top and to
question the methodology when we don't.''
</P>
<P>
   Dun &AMP; Bradstreet's survey was not a popularity contest. To
determine the best cities for small-business activity, D&AMP;B first
used its credit and marketing file of 11 million U.S. companies to
segment businesses with fewer than 20 employees by metropolitan
statistical area.
</P>
<P>
   It then created rankings based on four categories: percentage of
businesses less than 5 years old, employee growth from January 1999
to January 2000, overall job growth over three years based on U.S.
Bureau of Labor Statistics and risk of bankruptcy.
</P>
<P>
   San Francisco and the other Northern California cities placed
reasonably well in job growth and getting businesses started but
lagged in keeping them going.
</P>
<P>
   D&AMP;B economist Iris Geisler said California cities rank
consistently near the bottom on the risk-of-bankruptcy scale.
(Sacramento tied with Riverside-San Bernardino as worst in this
category.) But Geisler said higher failure rates might indicate
entrepreneurs have a greater appetite for risk and not necessarily
a negative business climate.
</P>
<P>
   No city scored well in all categories. For example, Las Vegas
ranked No.1 in new business formations and three-year economic
growth and No.2 in employee growth but near the bottom in risk of
bankruptcy (No.55 out of 60).
</P>
<P>
   ``The dominance of Southern and Southwestern cities in our study
is driven by the percentage of new business starts among the entire
business population in each of these cities,'' said Geisler.
</P>
<P>
   She called the absence of any California metropolitan area from
the top 10 ``somewhat surprising'' but noted that every large
California big city did better this year than in 1999.
</P>
<P>
   San Francisco Chamber of Commerce spokeswoman Carol Piasente
said the cost of doing business in San Francisco _ such as premium
office space that goes for $100 a square foot per year, houses that
sell for a median price of $510,000 and high labor costs _ are
enough to put off many small businesses.
</P>

   MINORITY BUSINESS AWARDS: The Small Business Administration
bestowed its minority owned business of the year awards on Monday.
Business Technologies and Solutions Inc. of Beaver Creek, Ohio, was
named National Minority Small Business Firm of the Year, but nine
other businesses received regional recognition.
</P>
<P>
   The winner from Region IX, made up of California, Arizona and
Hawaii, is Ruby Caffrey, president of SMF Systems Corp. in San
Ramon.
</P>
<P>
   Caffrey and her husband, Tom, an SMF executive vice president,
have built SMF into a better than $150 million-a-year computer
products and services company over the last 15 years.
</P>
<P>
   Until 1994, the two focused on selling information technology
products and services to companies. Then they got involved in the
SBA's Section 8(a) program that helps small companies owned by
socially and economically disadvantaged persons obtain federal
government contracts.
</P>
<P>
   Today, about two-thirds of SMF's business is with federal
agencies, including the Naval Facilities Command in Washington,
D.C., and the General Services Administration in San Francisco.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of entrepreneurs have the perception that the government
is a pain in the neck to deal with, that there's a lot of red tape
and it's hard to get paid,'' said Tom Caffrey, who previously
worked for an automated manufacturing systems company called RGL
Inc. in San Francisco. ``But with the Procurement Reform Act and
e-commerce, it's become a lot easier to deal with the government.
''
</P>
<P>
   Ruby Caffrey, a Chinese American from Oakland, and Tom Caffrey,
an Irish-Japanese American from Seaside Heights, N.J., note that it
is no longer necessary to be an ethnic minority to qualify for the
Section 8(a) program. Owners of businesses in disadvantaged
economic areas also may win federal government contracts through
the SBA program.
</P>
<P>
   CORRECTION: In last week's column, I garbled the title of Edward
Tian, one of Red Herring magazine's top 10 entrepreneurs of the
year. He is co-founder of AsiaInfo and CEO of China Netcom.

MICROSOFT SERVES UP NEW PRODUCTS 
 &HT;     BY HENRY NORR
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     c.2000 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
To hear Microsoft CEO Steve Ballmer tell it, the really big news
for the software giant Tuesday was not its victory in legal
maneuvering before the Supreme Court but the launch of a family of
products designed to boost the company's share of the lucrative
``enterprise'' market.
<P>
   Microsoft took over San Francisco's Warfield Theater to announce
the release of Windows 2000 Datacenter Server, the latest version
of its business operating system, and a slew of related products
with names like BizTalk Server 2000, Commerce Server 2000 and Host
Integration Server 2000.
</P>
<P>
   The new products are designed not for desktop PCs, but for the
giant servers that power computers for major companies and Web
sites. So far, this market has been dominated by the Unix operating
system running on proprietary hardware with expensive specialized
chips made by Sun Microsystems, Hewlett-Packard and others.
</P>
<P>
   But Microsoft hopes that its new software will change the
balance. Ballmer said more than 100 enterprise customers, including
Ford, Home Shopping Network, Honeywell, Lycos, Panasonic, Radio
Shack and Turner Broadcasting, have already decided to adopt the
new Microsoft products in place of the Unix-based software they had
previously relied on.
</P>
<P>
   The event was a marked contrast to February's0 launch of the
desktop version of Windows 2000, when the company brought rock star
Carlos Santana and Star Trek's Patrick Stewart to the Bill Grahan
Auditorium to help it celebrate.
</P>
<P>
   This time, the event featured a two-hour parade of CEOs from
corporate customers, consulting companies and hardware
manufacturers. Instead of the giant mock-up of a laptop, the stage
decor this time consisted of a lineup of refrigerator-size servers
made by Compaq, Dell, Hewlett-Packard, IBM and Unisys.
</P>
<P>
   And this time, Bill Gates, Microsoft's chairman and chief
software architect, was nowhere in sight.
</P>
<P>
   The software won't be marketed through retail channels, but only
in bundles with hardware and services from such companies. Only
four of the new products are actually shipping today. The others
are due by the end of the year, or in the case of a new product
called Mobile Information 2001 Server, in the first half of next
year.
</P>
<P>
   Ballmer and his partners on stage stressed that the new programs
would provide critical ``abilities'' _ reliability, scalability and
manageability _ that earlier versions of Windows had not.
</P>
<P>
   Noting that ``reliability is where we've been pushed the most,
based on people's experience with Windows 95 and 98,'' he said
Microsoft had responded with more testing, tighter certification
programs, and an array of support programs and uptime guarantees.
</P>
<P>
   ``We put a lot of emphasis on reliability _ a lot, a lot, a
lot,'' he said. One customer, FreeMarkets.com, said it has already
achieved 99.999 percent uptime with the new software.
</P>
<P>
   Several companies used the occasion to announce new server
systems. HP CEO Carly Fiorina, appearing on videotape, and Compaq
CEO Michael Capellas, live onstage, both touted new ``32-way''
servers, each with 32 Intel processors. Later, in a panel
discussion, Unisys CEO Lawrence Weinbach said both HP and Compaq
are actually reselling his company's 32-chip server.

WATER POLO A BETTER FIT THAN BASEBALL
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By HEATHER GRIPP  
 c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Dan Hackett's childhood dreams involved making diving catches
and showing off his strong arm. The dreams just didn't involve
doing it in the water.
</P>
<P>
   Hackett envisioned growing up to be a star shortstop for the New
York Yankees. Instead, he turned into the star goalkeeper for the
U.S. national men's water polo team. The former UCLA All-American
has been a member of the national team since 1991 and is widely
regarded as one of the best in the world at his position, making
him a key part of the U.S.' hopes of reaching the medal round if
they can get by Greece today.
</P>
<P>
   ``My favorite sport was baseball,'' Hackett said. ``It just so
happened, though, that this is the sport that was best for me.''
</P>
<P>
   Hackett, 30, turned to water polo when a growth spurt in high
school left him feeling his agility wasn't as good and baseball was
out of his future. The Syracuse, N.Y., native had grown up rooting
for the Yankees and playing on Little League all-star teams.
</P>
<P>
   He didn't even start playing water polo until his freshman year
of high school, when he was looking for a way to get out taking a
standard P.E. class. Water polo seemed the best option since he
didn't like the other fall sports offered for boys.
</P>
<P>
   His days as a field player lasted less than two weeks when his
lack of a swimming background made it difficult for him to keep up
with the pace of the game.
</P>
<P>
   The size that made him abandon baseball _ even though current
Yankees shortstop Derek Jeter is 6-foot-4 _ is one of Hackett's
greatest assets as a goalkeeper. He is 6-6, with an arm span of
6-10.
</P>
<P>
   ``Taking up space is the object of the game, so that definitely
gives him an advantage,'' U.S. head coach John Vargas said.
</P>
<P>
   ``It can pose a problem for shooters,'' Hackett said of his
size. ``They may not realize how much range I have. They go for the
far post, but it doesn't take me long to cover the cage.''
</P>
<P>
   His success is a product of more than just size, though.
</P>
<P>
   Even after years of playing among the elite, Hackett continues
to diligently study the game, looking for minute aspects he can
fine-tune, how to better read his teammates or what to expect from
opponents.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's very prepared,'' Vargas said. ``He anticipates well and
knows what's going to happen before it happens. It's hard to trick
him.''
</P>
<P>
   Hackett's devotion was bred at UCLA, where he was part of a
freshman class overflowing with goalkeepers and he was the only one
without a scholarship. Hackett decided then that if he was going to
endure the rigorous workouts, he was going to do whatever it took
to make sure he got to play in the games, too.
</P>
<P>
   He earned a spot on the junior national team that summer and
gained valuable experience against European teams. When he returned
to Westwood for his sophomore year, Hackett took over as the
starting goalkeeper. By the time he left, he had played in three
NCAA national-championship tournaments.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was a great goalie back then,'' said Guy Baker, who coached
Hackett's final season at UCLA. ``Everyone knew Danny was going to
be an Olympian.''
</P>
<P>
   Hackett made the 1996 Olympic team but played just one quarter
the entire tournament as the U.S. finished a disappointing seventh.
He's not sure how much longer he'll play, so a medal in Sydney
would be the perfect way to ensure he doesn't leave another dream
unfulfilled.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's become my prime focus,'' Hackett said. ``It's one thing
to make the Olympics. To be up there on the medal stand is another
thing.
</P>
<P>
   ``It didn't hit me as hard last time because I wasn't the one
out there playing most of the time. When you're the starting
goalie, a lot rests on you. I think I'll take it a lot more
personally this time if we don't win. I want to come home with a
medal.''

ALL THE WORLD'S A STAGE FOR FAIR MERCHANTS 
 &HT;     BY CARRIE KIRBY
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     c.2000 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
To get into the business of selling high-end soap products, Sidney
Rice had to learn which ingredients make the smoothest soap and
what to charge.
<P>
   That was the easy part. The real challenge was figuring out how
to explain modern concepts like ``aromatherapy'' and ``Web site''
without breaking the illusion that her customers are shopping in a
16th century alchemist's shop.
</P>
<P>
   It's all part of doing business at the Northern California
Renaissance Pleasure Faire, where vendors try to balance the
romance of bygone times with the reality of making a buck.
</P>
<P>
   In a world where a mass-produced candy dish sells at Target for
a mere $7.99, the fair provides a venue for craftspeople to make a
living selling their handiwork.
</P>
<P>
   Each weekend during its seven-week run, 9,000 to 10,000
customers come to the fair in Vacaville off Interstate 80 to watch
jugglers, eat turkey legs and snap up banners, jewelry and other
crafts.
</P>
<P>
   All the merriment is set in 16th century England, when Elizabeth
I was on the throne and Shakespeare was on the stage.
</P>
<P>
   The ambience works. ``I couldn't imagine having 4,000 people
walk into a shop in San Diego,'' said Rice, who sometimes sells two
or three times as much soap at the Pleasure Faire as she does at
street fairs at home in Southern California.
</P>
<P>
   During the week, she scours flea markets and garage sales for
the straw baskets and heavy metal pitchers that give her booth the
look of an alchemist's workshop. The fair's &LR;   &LR; shtick _ including
fanciful product names like ``the Philosopher's Stone'' _ helps her
sell, said Rice, who also works part time for Williams-Sonoma while
she ramps up her business.
</P>
<P>
   Of the Northern California fair's 153 craft booths, many are
one- or two-person operations such as Rice's.
</P>
<P>
   A few have expanded over the years to become robust, full-time
businesses. Take Michelle and Ray Amsbury of Whittier (Los Angeles
County), who, with eight employees, have earned as much as $800,000
in a single year making decorative tiles, Christmas ornaments and
beads.
</P>
<P>
   While Michelle Amsbury and two sales assistants run a booth at
the Pleasure Faire, Ray Amsbury runs another at the Harvest
Festival in Del Mar (San Diego County). The events are part of a
year-round circuit of Renaissance and Christmas fairs in which the
couple do business.
</P>
<P>
   After more than 30 years of fairs, Michelle Amsbury has as many
costumes as most people have clothes. Over that period, she has
learned to pepper her speech with Elizabethan phrases _ a ``good
morrow'' here, and ``I thank thee'' there.
</P>
<P>
   But she drops the pretense when it's time for customers to pay.
``It's clearer to use regular English,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   The fair in Vacaville holds workshops for merchants in language,
costume and Renaissance lifestyle. If they really want to delve
into their roles, merchants can also take a ``hawking'' class,
where they learn the oldest form of advertising _ shouting the
virtues of products to any potential customers who pass by.
</P>
<P>
   Modern conveniences like credit cards are acknowledged with a
little finesse: Some shops refer to them as ``Lady Visa and Master
Card,'' and merchants hide their cellular phones and credit card
machines in the back.
</P>
<P>
   These vendors are vital to the fair's business. Not only do they
populate the make-believe English village that the whole fantasy
rests on, but economically, they contribute 20 percent of the
Northern California fair's revenue, said General Manager David
McCullough.
</P>
<P>
   The rest of the fair's income, which is expected to near $1
million for the seven-weekend run from September to mid-October,
comes from the $17.50 entry price, parking and sales of food,
drinks, games and official fair merchandise.
</P>
<P>
   Since the Vacaville site is legally a temporary one, vendors
have to build new booths from scratch each year _ building costs
range from $100 for a modest wooden cart to $5,000 for a roomy
boutique. Many artists make these booths modular so they can take
them apart and move them to another festival later.
</P>
<P>
   Artists pay $200 for a space for the full seven weeks, then cut
the fair in for 15 percent of their revenues. If merchants
demonstrate their crafts for the crowds, the fair takes a smaller
cut _ 10 to 12 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Glass blower Pete Lanigan said demonstrating has a fringe
benefit: It attracts customers by showing them why a handmade vase
is more valuable than a factory-made one.
</P>
<P>
   ``I love taking someone who thinks glass is something that comes
from Kmart and showing them how it's done,'' said Lanigan, who puts
on an elaborate demonstration at the fair.
</P>
<P>
   Crowds of 50 or more gather on the half hour to watch him
repeatedly thrust a blob of glass on the end of a pipe into a
red-hot furnace, blowing through the pipe until the blob grows into
a stylish decanter.
</P>
<P>
   Getting a booth at the fair is competitive, since only a half
dozen or so new shops are accepted each year. New merchants must
submit samples of their wares months in advance for the fair to
review.
</P>
<P>
   ``We ask that you use natural materials. We're not going to be
selling blenders,'' said fair spokeswoman Shannon Wood.
</P>
<P>
   Once they make it in, a Renaissance festival can be a
craftmaker's dream market, since about 50 percent of visitors to
the Northern California Faire buy a craft.
</P>
<P>
   ``If people are paying to get in the door, they're already ready
to spend money,'' said James Dillehay, editor of the Craft Marketer
newsletter.
</P>
<P>
   Most merchants who do fairs year round say they make a good
middle-class living, with large operations like the Amsburys'
regularly pulling in six figures in revenue.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, some merchants fail to make a satisfactory profit and
opt not to return, Wood said.
</P>
<P>
   Some merchants, including Rice, the soapmaker, have branched out
onto the Internet, where they hope customers will look for them in
the long months before the fair reopens.
</P>
<P>
   It's difficult to say whether online sales will become a major
part of their business. Some merchants say online sales don't carry
the ``now or never'' feeling of a live event.
</P>
<P>
   In the case of the Renaissance Pleasure Faire, the Internet also
can't recreate the scent of roasting turkey or the sounds of
madrigals in the air.
</P>
<P>
   For now, fair officials say they aren't worried about the impact
of the Net on its operations. ``The fair's sales experience can't
be duplicated on a Web site,'' Wood said.
</P>
<P>
   For many merchants, the best part about selling at the fair is
the constant interaction with customers. It's like an all-day focus
group _ they find out which products are most popular and get
suggestions for new ones.
</P>
<P>
   Rice says she's gotten special orders for gift baskets and
landed new wholesale accounts from customers she met at the fair.
</P>
<P>
   Artists say nothing is comparable to being there in person for
customers. ``They'd have to see me, even if I was stuffed,'' said
knifemaker and potter Jon Schulps, who after 31 years has tried
leaving his booth to his staff to run on occasion. ``It doesn't
work. Sales went way down.''

NEW-ERA PC CARD DEBUTS

<TEXT>
<P>
   A Westlake Village company has created a wireless modem that
would, for the first time, allow laptop users to connect to the
Internet at speeds faster than a conventional phone modem.
</P>
<P>
   GTRAN introduced the personal-computer card called DotSurfer on
Tuesday at Chicago's GlobalXChange exposition, although DotSurfer
might not hit the U.S. market for another year. The device has
allowed cell phone and laptop users in Korea 64-kilobaud access to
the Internet since July, but United States carriers have yet to set
up the required frequency.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's like you are on the air all the time,'' said Deepak
Mehrotra, GTRAN's chief operating officer. ``Our target market is
the Web-browsing kind of people.''
</P>
<P>
   The card, which fits into a slot in laptops and hand-held
devices, could make mobile Internet access more common, overcoming
the slow connection speeds that saddle wireless modem cards widely
available now. The company joins a small group of wireless modem
providers attempting to break the barrier.
</P>
<P>
   Industry observers, however, said that DotSurfer could be
glitch-prone until the digital network it uses becomes as
established in the United States as it is in Korea.
</P>
<P>
   Jim Douglas, editor in chief of the technology magazine T3, said
the absence of infrastructure could spell trouble for DotSurfer.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's typically true to say that hardware technology that
reaches the market before the standard is rarely as effective as
hardware that is manufactured after the standard is up and
running,'' Douglas said.
</P>
<P>
   Mehrotra said GTRAN is trying to persuade wireless service
providers like Sprint and Verizon to offer DotSurfer as a wireless
option, but the company has no clients yet. The device retails in
Korea for about $200.
</P>
<P>
   Sierra Wireless, a British Columbia company, provides Sprint and
AT&AMP;T with similar wireless modems. Company officials said they are
looking into the technology GTRAN is using but are content to keep
offering 14.4-kilobaud Internet access and see what other
next-generation technologies rise to the top of the heap.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's the market that's right for us right now in North
America,'' said Sierra Marketing Manager Phoebe Yong.
</P>
<P>
   GTRAN, split into optics and wireless divisions, employs 165
people in several locations worldwide.

DOT-COM LUNCH MIGHT BRING BUFFETT INTO INVESTING'S CYBERAGE  &HT;     BY KATHLEEN PENDER
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     c.2000 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
Wouldn't you like to be a fly in the soup at this lunch?
<P>
   Next week, eight young Bay Area dot-commers will have a private
lunch with legendary investor and self-proclaimed technophobe
Warren Buffett at Stars restaurant in San Francisco.
</P>
<P>
   Pete Budlong _ a single, 35-year-old, semiretired Internet
millionaire _ won the lunch at an auction Saturday night benefiting
Glide Memorial United Methodist Church.
</P>
<P>
   Budlong placed the winning bid of $25,000 and plans to bring
seven friends _ all Web workers in their 20s and 30s _ to the meal.
He also invited comedian Robin Williams, who cohosted the event.
Glide says Williams will attend.
</P>
<P>
   Glide made a concerted effort to reach people like Budlong this
year, and it paid off big. The fund-raiser grossed $700,000
compared with only $240,000 last year. (More on how they did it
below.)
</P>
<P>
   Budlong didn't even know Buffett was up for auction until he got
to the event at the Galleria Design Center.
</P>
<P>
   The Giants season-ticket holder originally intended to bid on a
jersey signed by right fielder Ellis Burks. But when he saw Buffett
on the block, he decided to spend ``an amount I would put into a
startup investment'' to win the lunch.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've always been a big fan of his,'' he says. ``I read a book
about him, `The Warren Buffet Way,' a few years back. I like how he
looks at intrinsic value.''
</P>
<P>
   Budlong says he wants to keep the lunch ``very informal,
conversational, not too structured. What I want to know is, what
does he think of the Internet as an investment vehicle? Is he at
all beginning to understand it?''
</P>
<P>
   Buffett has famously avoided technology stocks because he
doesn't buy what he doesn't understand.
</P>
<P>
   On his company's Web site ( &LR; www.berkshirehathaway.com &LR; ), Buffett
writes, ``Being a lifelong technophobe, I tiptoed into the computer
world only a few years ago. If you have any ideas about how we can
make these pages more useful, just drop me a line (not e-mail
though; I haven't made that much progress).''
</P>
<P>
   Budlong figures Buffett knew what he was getting into when he
agreed to the auction. ``If you open this opportunity to the
public, and put it in the heart of Multimedia Gulch, he has to know
he's going to end up with some Internet guys, and he did.''
</P>
<P>
   An electrical engineer, Budlong worked for Hewlett-Packard and
several startups before becoming the first employee of
Classifieds2000.com. In 1998, the Santa Clara company was acquired
by ExciteAtHome for $50 million in Excite stock, which was worth
$300 million a year later.
</P>
<P>
   Budlong worked at Excite until last year. Since then, he has
been investing in Net startups and is on the board of three _
Giving Circle.com, an e-commerce platform that lets retailers give
part of their sales to charity; Voter.com, a political portal; and
Cybermoola, a prepaid Internet shopping card for teens.
</P>
<P>
   He also is involved with several nonprofits, including one that
is trying to build a world-class rose garden on the grounds of the
state Capitol in Sacramento dedicated to global peace.
</P>
<P>
   Budlong admits that he would like to get Buffett interested in
his companies and charities, ``but I don't want the lunch to be one
long sales pitch.''
</P>
<P>
   He knows the odds of hooking Buffett on tech stocks are very
long. ``But if there is a chance, this is a good chance,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   As a value investor, Buffett might be happy to know he wasn't
the most-expensive item at the auction. Two people paid $30,000
each to have the Glide Ensemble, a 140-voice choir, perform at two
separate events.
</P>
<P>
   And when dinner with Robin and Marsha Williams went for $14,000,
the fun-loving couple agreed to have a second dinner with another
bidder for $14,000 and a third dinner for $20,000.
</P>
<P>
   When the winners came up to pay for their prizes, John Warner,
Glide's fund developer, asked what they did for a living, and most
of them were Internet types.
</P>
<P>
   ``We completely rebranded the event to attract a younger,
hipper, trendier crowd,'' Warner says. ``We changed the name (from
Raise Your Spirits to Soul of the City). We designed new graphics.
We moved it out of a stuffy old hotel into the Galleria.''
</P>
<P>
   For the first time, Glide marketed the shindig through e-mail
lists (such as the A List) and Web sites (including Craig's List).
That boosted attendance from 650 last year to 1,200 this year.
</P>
<P>
   A high-tech company called Lante Corp. ``completely digitized
our silent auction,'' Warner adds. ``Instead of writing your name
on slips of paper, you bid on computers. And there were people
walking around with wireless Palm Pilots, so you could increase
your bids.''
</P>
<P>
   Glide wanted to send the message: ``Hey, this is a sophisticated
nonprofit that does believe in technology, that does believe in the
digital divide. It made a huge statement.''
</P>
<P>
   And it worked. ``There were a lot more people in the room and a
lot more monied people in the room,'' Warner says. ``You know the
stereotype _ young, rich dot-commers _ there were tons of them.''
</P>
<P>
   INSIDER TRADING _ PART II: As part of its crackdown on insider
trading, the Securities and Exchange Commission is getting tougher
on the relatives of corporate executives.
</P>
<P>
   In the past, when a person traded stock on inside information
obtained from a family member, the SEC had to prove that the person
violated an explicit ``duty of trust or confidence.''
</P>
<P>
   Rule 10b5-2, which takes effect Oct. 23, assumes that a such a
duty automatically exists between insiders and their spouses,
children, parents and siblings.
</P>
<P>
   What does this mean?
</P>
<P>
   Here's an example. Suppose a husband passes company secrets to
his wife, who trades on the information and/or passes it along to
someone else, who trades on the tip.
</P>
<P>
   To prove illegal insider trading, prosecutors in the past had to
show that the husband said something like, ``Honey, this is top
secret, you have to keep it to yourself and not abuse it,'' and the
wife said, ``Sure thing.''
</P>
<P>
   In the future, prosecutors won't have to prove that such an
exchange took place. It will be up to the spouses to prove that a
duty of trust and confidence did not exist.
</P>
<P>
   ``The SEC says, when it comes to members of the immediate
family, we presume there was a duty of trust or confidence, unless
you can prove otherwise,'' says attorney Jared Kopel of Wilson
Sonsini Goodrich &AMP; Rosati.
</P>
<P>
   The SEC noted that the new rule does not automatically apply to
domestic partners, stepparents or stepchildren, although they may
be liable if they have a ``history or pattern'' of sharing
confidences.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our experience in this area indicates that most instances of
insider trading between or among family members involve spouses,
parents and children, or siblings; therefore, we have enumerated
these relationships and not others,'' the SEC writes.
</P>
<P>
   For more information on 10b5-2 and 10b5-1 _ the other new
insider trading rule I wrote about yesterday _ go to

 &HT;    Battle of the Baptists
 &HT;    By Kim Sue Lia Perkes
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ After two decades of wrangling, the Baptist
General Convention of Texas and the Southern Baptist Convention are
headed for an Olympic-size showdown.
</P>
<P>
   Which takes home the gold will be up to Texas Baptist messengers
at their state convention in late October. The messengers, under a
recommendation made by their executive board Tuesday, will decide
whether to yank more than $5 million in financial support from six
seminaries from the Southern Baptist Convention, a national group.
</P>
<P>
   The board also asked Texas Baptists to approve a budget plan
that would allow the state convention to earmark the millions of
dollars it sends to the national body for specific programs,
circumventing the historical way the money has been divided.
</P>
<P>
   It is viewed as a bold move for the moderate Texas convention,
which is risking the loss of conservative churches, to make a
statement that it does not support the national convention's
conservative theology or political agenda. The Baptist General
Convention of Texas is the largest Baptist state convention in the
nation.
</P>
<P>
   Texas Baptists contribute nearly 14 percent to the Southern
Baptist Convention's Cooperative Program, the money pool used to
finance missionary work, seminaries, Baptist agencies and
administrative costs. The national body uses a funding formula to
designate where the money goes.
</P>
<P>
   Now, the Texas convention wants to bypass that formula,
requiring its proposed $19.1 million Cooperative Program
contribution be used:
</P>
<P>
   _ Predominantly to finance the national body's mission work.
</P>
<P>
   _ For Texas students already enrolled in the six Southern
Baptist Convention seminaries, capping the state's contribution to
Southern Baptist Convention seminaries at $1 million. The majority
of that amount is expected to go to Southwestern Baptist
Theological Seminary in Fort Worth, but that would be half of the
seminary's current contribution from the Texas convention.
</P>
<P>
   _To not finance the national convention's Ethics and Religious
Liberty Commission, which currently is receiving about $750,000
from Texas Baptists. The state convention contends the agency
supports a political agenda that violates the time-honored Baptist
tradition of separation of church and state.
</P>
<P>
   _To barely help the national body's governing board by giving
$10,000, down from the current Texas Baptist contribution of about
$750,000.
</P>
<P>
   The change would benefit Texas seminaries that cropped up after
conservatives solidified their control of the national Southern
Baptist Convention and one longtime Texas school that wants to
obtain seminary accreditation.
</P>
<P>
   Under the new proposal, George W. Truett Seminary at Baylor
University in Waco would receive $1 million _ more than double its
current funding _ and Logsdon School of Theology at Hardin-Simmons
University in Abilene would get $750,000, more than seven times
what it receives now. The Hispanic Baptist Theology School in San
Antonio would get a $500,000 infusion to use toward obtaining
seminary accreditation.
</P>
<P>
   Texas Baptist leaders said they want to give money to the state
seminaries that promote ``responsible academic freedom'' instead of
what they see as the right-wing fundamentalism being taught in the
national convention's seminaries. National leaders contend Texas
leaders are more liberal than moderate and seminary teaching is
about staying true to Jesus Christ and the Bible.
</P>
<P>
   National Baptist leaders also argue the Texas convention is
going to force a split between the two organizations and that state
leaders do not reflect the sentiments of Texas Baptists in the
pews.
</P>
<P>
   Both sides agree no one can predict how the changes, which are
expected to pass at the state convention, will effect either
convention. Individual Texas churches, for instance, may decide to
send money to directly to the national body to make up the deficit.
The Southern Baptist Convention may decide it cannot take any money
from the Texas convention that does not adhere to the Cooperative
Program funding formula.
</P>
<P>
   Two things are certain: the Baptist General Convention of Texas
is at a critical crossroads and what happens here will have a
national impact.

 &HT;    Rocker's tranquil N.Y. trip
 &HT;    By Mark Bradley
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK - One man graced the back page of all three tabloids
Tuesday. That the man was Vinny Testaverde, Jets quarterback and
center of the latest Big Apple tempest, was proof that time lessens
all furors, even those involving the furious John Rocker.
</P>
<P>
   The man who required the conveyance of an unmarked police van
and the construction of a special bullpen canopy when he came here
in June was essentially left alone this trip. Upon arrival in
Manhattan on Monday, Rocker walked into the lobby of the Grand
Hyatt without escort or incident. For Tuesday's game, roughly 500
officers were on duty at Shea Stadium _ up from the usual
complement of 45 but down from the 600 of June. This show of force
seemed most benign. At 4:30 p.m., Rocker stood just inside the
stadium press entrance talking on his cell phone; there were police
all around, but they didn't appear to be guarding him.
</P>
<P>
   Approached by three New York writers before the game, Rocker was
actually sort of beguiling. Would he consent to an interview?
``Ummm,'' he said, drawing it out, pretending the suggestion had
left him torn. ``I'm going to say no today.'' Even the writers
laughed.
</P>
<P>
   Over the last 12 months, John Rocker has done his best to be
noticed. What's remarkable about the tail end of the 2000 season is
how little stir he makes apart from his pitching. And even his
critics -- this correspondent remains one -- must admit that he's
pitching splendidly. He has become the unchallenged closer for a
bullpen that is about to win the Rolaids team championship, no
small achievement.
</P>
<P>
   It is again possible to envision a World Series that ends with
John Rocker on the mound, throwing Strike 3 past Tino Martinez.
Rocker's season began with a suspension and then, in short order,
tracked a path from welcome-back ovations to on-field moonings to
an abrupt loss of pitch command to heated exchange with the writer
of the infamous Sports Illustrated article. On June 5 he was
dispatched to the minor leagues, and more than a few folks would
have bet that he'd thrown his last fastball as an Atlanta Brave.
</P>
<P>
   But an injury to Rudy Seanez forced the Braves to recall Rocker
within the week, and in the weeks since he has mostly kept quiet
and thrown strikes. Has Rocker changed? ``I don't spend a lot of
time around him, so I don't really know,'' Tom Glavine said. ``But
he's been pitching better, and he seems less volatile, more at
ease. It doesn't seem like he's waiting for someone to get on him
and then jump back at (the critic). He's less confrontational.''
</P>
<P>
   Even more remarkable than the muting of Rocker is the capacity
of this team to absorb his excesses and still position itself to
win yet another division title. In the end, professionalism trumped
one man's psychodrama. ``If there was any place it was going to
happen,'' Glavine said, ``this was it.''
</P>
<P>
   On John Rocker's first trip back to New York, he was the focal
point of the tabloids' back and front pages. The second time
through, he was just another guy come to do a job. To borrow his
words from last autumn, full-blown hysteria had become a tired act.

 &HT;    U.S. makes rainy day golden memory
 &HT;    By Mike Tierney
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   SYDNEY _ This was no day for the beach. Rain splattered against
the bundled crowd's brightly colored ponchos. High winds rendered
nearby Bondi Beach deserted except for a few incurable surfers.
Sunscreen and shades stayed inside pockets and purses.
</P>
<P>
   It was, however, a day for the U.S. beach volleyballers. On
soaked sand, Dain Blanton and Eric Fonoimoana flustered the favored
Brazilians and saran-wrapped the gold medal today.
</P>
<P>
   Final score: 12-11, 12-9. That's two men's golds in two Games
since the sport of suds, skin and sun (usually) was initiated in
Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
   ``We took one match at a time,'' said Blanton, reciting an old
bromide but a necessary one because his pair was one of the last to
qualify. They were 0-4 this year against Jose Marco Melo and
6-foot-7 Ricardo Santos.
</P>
<P>
   ``None of those four were one-sided in any way,'' reminded Melo,
whose adopted beach name is simply Ze Marco. ``Every (tournament)
is different.''
</P>
<P>
   Except for a few beach-garbed spectators who were Sydney's
version of shirtless NFL wackos in January, the only bathing-suited
types were the four players. But the atmosphere that has made this
venue popular was intact.
</P>
<P>
   Each scored point was an excuse for fans to stand and dance to
blaring pop music. Brazil followers, the party animals of any
Games, added to the festivities with horns blowing and flags
waving. Rather than medals, the ambience suggested the twosomes
were playing for a keg of beer.
</P>
<P>
   It seemed more beach than volleyball.
</P>
<P>
   But the Americans engaged in two hours of athletic give-and-take
with the formidable foes from the beach hotbed. They warded off
four set points in the opening set. The second lasted 66 minutes,
with sides rarely stringing together two points.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, Fonoimoana blocked a shot Brazil failed to return.
Blanton stood transfixed, in shock, as his teammate approached with
an embrace. They fell onto the sand and locked in a long hug.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was just a release from a lot of hard work,'' Fonoimoana
said.
</P>
<P>
   The elements made their work harder than ever. The Americans
prefer a dry course.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can't control the weather, but I was a little concerned,''
Blanton said. ``Ours is a fast game, a power game. We want the ball
to be light to serve aces. The rain was no help.''
</P>
<P>
   The Brazilians' favorite status might have been a hindrance.
``They came in with a lot of pressure,'' Blanton observed,
especially with the top-seeded Brazilian women settling for silver
Monday.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's unbelievable,'' Blanton said.
</P>
<P>
   In other words, it was some day at the beach.
</P>

 &HT;    Olympic fairy tale comes to a sad ending
 &HT;    By Mike Tierney
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   SYDNEY - The ultimate American Olympic fairy tale has come to a
sudden, sad ending.
</P>
<P>
   Taekwondo gold medal favorite Kay Poe, an Olympian only because
of her best friend's supreme act of generosity, crashed in her
first match Wednesday. Tense and passive, according to her personal
coach, Poe succumbed to Hanne Hoegh Poulsen of Denmark 5-3 in the
under 49 kg class.
</P>
<P>
   The result left Poe and her dearest pal, Esther Kim, shattered.
It was a cold splash of water to the face after a dreamy four
months during which they were hailed worldwide for Kim's decision
to bow out of the U.S. Trials finals in deference to Poe's
dislocated kneecap.
</P>
<P>
   And it frustrated Poe's coach, Jin Won Kim -- Esther's father.
He said his presence alongside the mat might have made a
difference. Only the national team coach is permitted to work the
area.
</P>
<P>
   ``When she walked in here, I could tell she was very tight from
the pressure,'' said Master Kim, who watched in horror from the
front row. ``I saw her face (and thought), 'Oh, what's wrong with
her?' I was beginning to worry.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can make her more comfortable. Tell a joke. Make her laugh.
He (Young In Cheon) is a good coach, but he probably doesn't know
her well.''
</P>
<P>
   Poe, first place at the Trials, had trained almost non-stop for
a week while holed up in the dorm-like athletes village. ``I've
been on pretty strict lockdown,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Kim, second place, shopped, attended sports events and the
Opening Ceremony, been fawned over by the Sydney hierarchy,
received heaps of praise from the Olympic family and media and
stayed in a spiffy hotel as guest of Juan Antonio Samaranch. She
walked into an IOC executive board meeting and was greeted by a
videotape of her gig on ``Oprah,'' her most cherished of the pair's
national TV appearances.
</P>
<P>
   Now, who was the real winner here?
</P>
<P>
   Both of them, as Kim, 21, has insisted since May. ``People said
there's not two winners in the same division,'' she said before
Wednesday's fight. ``But we made it possible for two to come.''
</P>
<P>
   Poe, who said Wednesday her knee was fine, would have been
unable to stand, much less defend herself, against Kim at the
Trials. So Kim, in effect, withdrew -- a gesture that reverberates
still through an Olympics splotched by positive drug tests and
selfishness.
</P>
<P>
   Kim never has expressed regrets. ``It's not like I'm throwing my
dream away,'' she said. ``I was just passing it along.''
</P>
<P>
   Kim confessed that she misses basking in taekwondo's debut as an
Olympics medal sport.
</P>
<P>
   ``The feel of the ring . . . to look up and see the U.S. (crowd)
cheering for me,'' she said wistfully. ``I'm here to see Kay fight.
It doesn't change the fact that I would like to be fighting, too.''
</P>
<P>
   Kim alternately stood and sat as she watched Poe, top-ranked in
the field of 12, push ahead in points 3-1 after two periods. Even
then, Master Kim's confidence level was low.
</P>
<P>
   ``Kay must attack, be aggressive, get inside,'' he said later.
``The other girl is tall, with long legs. Kay gave her too much
space.''
</P>
<P>
   During the break before the final period, Poe looked up toward
the first row. Master Kim shouted instructions and Esther
demonstrated a technique known as the trap that they wanted her to
apply.
</P>
<P>
   ``Miscommunication,'' Master Kim said. ``I think there were some
mixed signals.''
</P>
<P>
   For her part, Poe says she absorbed their advice. However, as
the period began, it was the Dane who attacked, earning two quick
points. She broke the tie inside the last minute with two more.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't play my normal game,'' Poe said. ``I was playing a
safe game. I was feeling a little apprehensive.''
</P>
<P>
   Kim, in tears, had rushed backstage to console Poe. They hugged.
Kim told her, ``Good job.''
</P>
<P>
   Poe, meeting the media, was dry-eyed until a question came about
her family and supporters in attendance. She began to cry.
</P>
<P>
   Kim is normally the incessant talker. This time, as her father
waited with a reporter, she rushed past, waving a hand and
muttering, ``I don't want to say anything.''

 &HT;    Angelo Taylor hopes to live his dream of a gold medal
 &HT;    By Mike Fish
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   SYDNEY - Kicking back, alone and with time on his hands, Angelo
Taylor runs the race over and over in his head. Never the whole
jaunt around the red rubber of the Olympic Stadium track. Just
snippets.
</P>
<P>
   He's out front. Always, first across the finish line _ taking
home gold in the 400-meter hurdles.
</P>
<P>
   ``No, I never visualize catching anybody or holding them off,''
Taylor said. ``It's just me in front, like I'm actually running.
I'm not seeing who is behind me. I'm coming off that last hurdle
and sprinting for home.''
</P>
<P>
   If he can live out his dream today in the 400 hurdle final,
Taylor would succeed his former Georgia Tech training partner
Derrick Adkins as Olympic champion and follow old Southwest DeKalb
(Ga.) High School teammate Terrence Trammell to the medal podium.
Trammell, 21, captured the silver in the 110 hurdles Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Taylor comes to the final a slight favorite with a world-leading
time of 47.62 seconds, but he has a definite rival in Llewellyn
Herbert, who has a best of 47.93. The South African hurdler beat
Taylor in three head-to-head races leading up to the Games. In
Taylor's favor, he won the season's marquee invitational meet in
Zurich.
</P>
<P>
   ``He likes to capitalize off of my mistakes,'' Taylor said.
``I've been leading a race, I'll make a mistake and he's passed me.
He's strong, no doubt. He runs a smooth race.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just need to run clean over the hurdles. If I run clean, he
can't beat me.''
</P>
<P>
   After the early round races here, Herbert, who has a Southern
California look with the blond hair and wrap-around sunglasses, has
steadfastly avoided being drawn into a war of words.
</P>
<P>
   ``We'll just see in the finals,'' Herbert said, asked about his
rivalry with Taylor. ``I'm not talking about anybody now.''
</P>
<P>
   The two matched up in the same semifinal heat Monday, with
Herbert finishing just slightly in front. Obviously, both held a
back for the final. What could work in Taylor's favor is his knack
for being able to make adjustment during the rounds of major
championships.
</P>
<P>
   The 400-meter sprint over 10 hurdles takes tremendous stamina,
alone. But it's magnified when rather than a single race, you have
three hard races over four days as is the case at the Olympics.
</P>
<P>
   ``I like having to run the two rounds before the final because I
can adjust to the track,'' Taylor said. ``That's to my advantage. I
haven't had a clean race (over the hurdles) in Europe all year. But
in the final at the Olympic trials I did, because I had a chance to
run on the same track for three days and make the adjustments.
</P>
<P>
   ``With my strength, I can run three straight days fast. Some
guys would prefer one race and go home.''
</P>
<P>
   Taylor was a multi-event track star at Southwest DeKalb, along
with playing basketball and football. The summer of `96 he didn't
take in the Games, because he was in Houston competing in the
Junior Olympics.
</P>
<P>
   At the Junior Olympics, he anchored a 1,600-meter relay team
from the East Atlanta Track Cub that set a world record. Also on
the team was Tucker High's Dwight Phillips, Taylor's roommate here
who's in the long jump finals Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   ``Since `96, it's been my goal to win the gold medal,'' Taylor
said. ``It's real important to me. I want to go out there and run a
fast time. My goal is definitely a gold medal.''

 &HT;    Jones ready to get back on the track
 &HT;    By Mike Fish

<TEXT>
<P>
   SYDNEY - After a couple turbulent days, hounded by a drug
scandal involving her husband, it's understandable if Marion Jones
is eager to get back to business on the track.
</P>
<P>
   Only it won't be a carefree day at the Bondi Beach.
</P>
<P>
   As the track and field competition resumes today, the
24-year-old Jones shoulders her busiest single workload a
first-round sprint at 200 meters in the morning, followed by a
second-round heat in the evening, and then an hour later qualifying
in the long jump. None of this preliminary stuff, though, figures
to pose an immediate threat advancing towards her quest to win five
gold medals.
</P>
<P>
   But with NBC scrambling for ratings, Jones' return couldn't have
come sooner for network brass who've lucked into a soap-opera of
sorts. Since she sprinted off with gold in the 100 meters, an
international scandal has broken out amid allegations U.S. track
officials covered up a positive drug test by her husband,
shot-putter C.J. Hunter. By the couple's side at a Tuesday press
conference stood prominent defense attorney Johnnie Cochrane Jr., a
family friend who will represent Hunter against the doping charges.
</P>
<P>
   Appealing to be left alone to prepare for four remaining Olympic
events, Jones said, ``This has been a very difficult last couple of
days for C.J. and I, and I am here pretty much to show my complete
support for my husband.''
</P>
<P>
   The network figures to break away long enough from the Jones
story to replay the men's 400 hurdles and women's 100 hurdles,
where several local athletes have a shot at gold including
Southwest DeKalb product Angelo Taylor in the men's hurdles.
Georgia Tech assistant coach Chris Huffins begins first-day
competition in the men's decathlon.
</P>
<P>
   The day's only other final has ``The Great Dane,'' world
record-holder Wilson Kipketer, favored for gold in the 800 meters.
This is the Olympic debut for Kipketer, who a Kenyan who hadn't
completed Danish citizenship requirements in time to run in
Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
   As for Jones, the only real intrigue on the track is whether she
can hit a qualifying mark early in the long jump and allow herself
to conserve some energy. The long jump final in two days, coupled
with both relays, loom far more challenging than the 200 sprint.
</P>
<P>
   Jones isn't a polished a long jumper. At last year's World
Championships, she won the long-jump bronze medal and then suffered
an injury in the 200 that knocked her out of the competition. She
arrives at the Games ranked third in the world, with a best of 23
feet, 1/2 inch.
</P>
<P>
   Atlanta silver medalist Fiona May of Italy and Tatyana Kotova of
Russia are favored ahead of Jones. Another intriguing challenger is
Heike Drechsler, gold medalist in Barcelona and silver in Seoul.
</P>
<P>
   ``Anytime I decide to jump the pressure is going to be there
simply because I've had some problems in the past,'' Jones said.
``What I have been hearing from some of my biggest supporters is
really all it takes is one big jump, one big jump, and the
competition could be over. So that's what I am hoping.''

<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Being first lady isn't a job, Hillary Rodham Clinton
said early this year in Manhattan, ``It's a role.''
</P>
<P>
   While making her one of the most celebrated women in the world,
her performance in that role has driven nearly a decade of
dinner-table speculation about the scale of her ambition (Does she
want to be president?) and the state of her marriage (Why does she
stay with him?).
</P>
<P>
   ``I am a Rorschach test,'' she has said, for what Americans are
struggling with in their working and married lives. A political
cartoon in the wake of the O.J. Simpson murder trial _ one of
thousands that Clinton has inspired _ captured her ubiquity in pop
culture as it lampooned her peculiar gift for making people
suspicious: ``More bad news. The bloody glove fits Hillary.''
</P>
<P>
   Her fame is a two-edged sword, allowing her into a political
arena where no first lady has dared go before, but where many of
the people do not like her. She is the first spouse of a president
to have a law degree, to deride the baking of cookies, to testify
before a grand jury and to try to use her fame as a springboard to
elective federal office.
</P>
<P>
   Yet her role as first lady _ a protean performance veering from
secretive boss of a failed health care plan to self-effacing
advocate for children, from suspect in an Arkansas land deal to
victim in America's most famous sex scandal _ has created a
potential roadblock to her winning a seat in the Senate.
</P>
<P>
   One of three New Yorkers has an unfavorable opinion of her.
Nationally, four of 10 Americans disapprove. Her Republican
opponent, Rep. Rick Lazio, is building much of his campaign around
these negative ratings, in the hope that they will grow. His
television advertisements end with the refrain, ``You just can't
trust her.'' In a national fund-raising letter, Lazio said he could
sum up why Americans should send him money in six words: ``I'm
running against Hillary Rodham Clinton.''
</P>
<P>
   The eagerness of non-New Yorkers to spend money to keep Clinton
out of Congress is a reason the New York Senate race is shaping up
as the most expensive in history.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton declined comment for this article, but a campaign
strategist acknowledged that voter disapproval was ``out there.''
</P>
<P>
   Some voters have been annoyed by her move to New York. They have
faulted what they say is her Hillary-knows-best tone. Some suspect
that calculated ambition kept her in the White House during the
scandal involving an intern, as she stuck with a philanderer so she
could run for the Senate. Others are taken aback by her willingness
to endure the gossip about her marriage.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton's strategy for dealing with her negative ratings has
been to try to grind them into dust. ``These are things you can
overcome by doing, by doing the work,'' said Mark Penn, her
pollster.
</P>
<P>
   In 18 months, Clinton has traveled to every county in the state,
paid extraordinarily attention to local concerns and explained her
family-friendly policies in sometimes numbing detail.
</P>
<P>
   The grinding process helps explain why a race that seems so
compelling from a distance can sometimes be so soporific when
viewed up close, as Clinton instructs her supporters on the fine
points of milk prices, pediatric procedures and upstate airfares.
The strategy, though, appears to be working.
</P>
<P>
   Not long after Clinton signaled her interest in the Senate early
last year, polls showed the percentage of Americans with a negative
opinion of her jumped from the low 20s, where her unfavorable
numbers had fallen during the Lewinsky scandal, to nearly 40
percent.
</P>
<P>
   Those negative ratings have since declined in New York, although
not nationally. For most of this year, about a third of registered
voters in the state have said they have an unfavorable opinion of
her, while less than half view her positively, according to several
New York/Times/CBS polls. With the election six weeks away, about
one-third of those planning to vote for Lazio say they support him
because he is not she.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton opened a 9-point lead over Lazio, according to a
Times/CBS poll conducted in the days immediately after their debate
in Buffalo in mid-September, although other polls have shown them
to be more evenly matched. All the polls showed that she has
narrowed a gap among suburban voters, while apparently cutting into
one of the surprise anomalies of her candidacy _ a decidedly chilly
reception among white women. Lazio held a commanding lead in June
among white women. According to The Times/CBS poll, that lead had
slipped by last week, but remained at 8 points.
</P>
<P>
   As Election Day nears, many New Yorkers, especially undecided
voters who have paid little attention to the race, are being forced
to re-examine what, if anything, irritates them about Clinton, and
to decide whether they are irritated enough to vote for Lazio. He
remains a relative unknown to more than a third of voters and his
negative ratings have risen sharply, to 28 percent from 10 percent
since June.
</P>
<P>
   ``I want to like her, but I can't,'' Dr. Barbara Barnett, an
emergency room physician with two children, told seven women in her
book club on the night of the first Clinton-Lazio debate. ``I lost
respect for her when she stood by him during Monica.''
</P>
<P>
   The debate in Buffalo was actually on the air as the book club
convened, but the television was off in the Westchester County home
of Mary Ushay. The women would catch highlights later, and several
of them would judge that Clinton had won it handily and that Lazio
had come across as a bully.
</P>
<P>
   The juicy debate in Ushay's living room in Eastchester had
little to do with the policies, campaign appearances or TV
advertisements of candidate Clinton. Nor did it deal with Lazio,
other than to wonder who he is and why he's running.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Instead, the women, as they acknowledged to a reporter who sat
with them, obsessed on a first lady who was more soap-opera
character than Senate aspirant. The book-club members, all white,
married, middle-class residents of Westchester County, said their
lives were much too busy to pay careful attention to Clinton's
campaign. The four Democrats, three Republicans and one noncitizen
said they routinely tossed her fliers in the trash.
</P>
<P>
   What intrigued them, instead, was the woman who stumbled as
``co-president'' when she took command of health-care reform, who
steeled her way through Whitewater, who seethed about ``a vast
right-wing conspiracy'' before her husband admitted his affair.
</P>
<P>
   The book readers from Westchester (the week's book was Barbara
Kingsolver's ``The Poisonwood Bible,'' one of Clinton's favorites)
have been watching, wondering and arguing about her since rumors
about the president's affairs first came out.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton insinuated herself into their lives with her 1992
appearance on ``60 Minutes,'' when Bill Clinton denied an affair
with Gennifer Flowers (he later admitted it under oath) and she
said, ``You know I'm not sitting here, some little woman standing
by my man like Tammy Wynette.''
</P>
<P>
   They remembered, too, how cold her body language seemed around
the president during the impeachment fight. They had been amazed
that her marriage survived and felt sorry for daughter Chelsea. But
when Clinton announced last year she was running for the Senate and
moving to Westchester, the women said they felt used and
manipulated.
</P>
<P>
   ``I resent her moving here,'' said Diane Cohen, 43, a homemaker
from Pelham, the mother of two and a Republican. ``My guess is the
minute she loses, if she loses, she'll be gone.''
</P>
<P>
   Ushay, the host, a mother of three and a Democrat, said that
Clinton might do a lot of good for New York. Echoing the other
women in the room, all of them mothers, she said Clinton knew more
about children's issues and would probably do more for families
than Lazio.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're talking about a junior senator from New York having an
incredible in with someone who might be president,'' said Ushay,
41. ``And yet, I don't want her to be my senator. She has so much
baggage. She must have known what people would be talking about.
Yet she still ran. I think she thinks a lot of herself.''
</P>
<P>
   With the exception of two Republicans in the room, all the women
said that Clinton could win their vote _ but that it would not be
enthusiastic or without regret. They were finding it all but
impossible, they said, to separate the soap-opera character of
eight years from the Senate candidate of the past 18 months.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just resent that she wasn't strong enough to leave him and
go out on her own,'' said Barnett, 37, the emergency room physician
and a Republican who described herself as undecided. ``We finally
had the opportunity to have a strong first lady. But she used her
marriage for personal gain. I can't get over that.''
</P>
<P>
   A half block from the White House, Penn, the pollster and one of
Clinton's strategists, sat in his second-floor office on
Pennsylvania Avenue and listened to a summary of what the eight New
York women had agonized about.
</P>
<P>
   He wasn't surprised. He has heard much the same thing before,
from his own polls and from focus groups. Carpetbagger. Pushy
do-gooder. So hungry for power that she put up with a bad marriage.
For Penn, these negative ratings are yesterday's news.
</P>
<P>
   ``You are not going to erase those concerns,'' he said. ``Voters
are going to balance them against how hard she has worked, what she
stands for and what they think she'll do for them.''
</P>
<P>
   Penn takes credit for devising Clinton's
grind-the-negatives-to-dust strategy. ``No one has followed this
problem, or issue, more than I have day and night for a year and a
half,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   His strategy for Clinton is an updated, New York model of a
product the pollster has been selling for years to Clinton's
husband. A focus on small issues (school uniforms, emergency phone
numbers, V-chips) helped President Clinton pull out of a public
opinion nose-dive during his first term. It also helped him to hang
on to his job through the scandal.
</P>
<P>
   On his desk, Penn had poll results from the New York Senate
debate. The results, like those of several polls, showed Clinton
winning among women, many of whom said they were put off by Lazio's
aggressiveness.
</P>
<P>
   ``If every woman had seen the debate,'' he said, ``the rest of
the campaign would effectively be canceled.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton was on track, Penn said, in her slow and deliberate
transformation from first lady icon to credible New York candidate.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is an incredible standard that Hillary has to meet that
no one else has to meet,'' he said. ``She is making steady
progress. The average New Yorker has really got a chance to see who
she is and not who they thought she was.''
</P>
<P>
   Because of the time that Clinton has spent campaigning in the
state, Penn said, there is now a ``a very big difference between
the New York Hillary and the national Hillary.''
</P>
<P>
   It's the ``national Hillary,'' however, who is the household
name. That's the woman who rubs four out of 10 Americans the wrong
way. And she is the money machine behind the New York Senate race,
both for herself and her adversaries.
</P>
<P>
   She has raised more than $22 million, about 60 percent of it
from outside New York, while enabling her adversaries to collect
$39 million, much from of it from out-of-state Clinton haters.
Mayor Rudolph Giuliani raised $23.3 million before he quit the race
in May, and Lazio has since collected $15.7 million.
</P>
<P>
   None of this counts millions in soft money collected by
political parties, of which the Democrats have spent at least $5
million praising Clinton and attacking her opponents. Lazio has not
collected soft money but advocacy groups and political committees,
many of them using money raised outside New York, have bought TV
commercials to help him. Last weekend, both campaigns struck an
agreement to stop using unregulated campaign funds.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Anti-Hillary money bubbles up in places like Mobile, Ala., where
in early September Lazio arrived by chartered jet for a
$500-a-plate shrimp-and-grits breakfast. It was a ``hard money''
event, meaning that it collected donations of up to $2,000 from
individuals, money that can be spent directly on Lazio's campaign.
</P>
<P>
   Standing on a spiral staircase in a handsome Greek Revival home
with four white columns out front, Lazio spoke to 90 people for
about five minutes and received $45,000 in contributions.
</P>
<P>
   The day before Lazio nipped in and out of Mobile, the local
newspaper, The Mobile Register, ran an editorial cartoon that
explained the metaphysics of the breakfast. On the right side of
the cartoon stood Clinton, with a big smile on her face and her
body drawn in the shape of a pudgy punching bag. A sign above her
head said, ``$500 a pop.''
</P>
<P>
   A man with ``NY'' on his back and boxing gloves on his hands
said to a fellow pugilist from Alabama, ``Be my guest, my
distinguished Southern friend.'' The Alabamian replied, ``After
you, my noble brother from the North.'' A tiny elephant cartoon
exclaimed, ``Republican unity, thy name is Hillary.''
</P>
<P>
   Lazio's applause line in his brief speech came when he promised
to ``bring the Clinton era to an end.'' That was according to
several people inside the room. The event was closed to reporters.
</P>
<P>
   But after Lazio left the house, in pursuit of more anti-Hillary
money in Louisiana and Texas, four Alabama Republicans, three men
and a woman, stayed behind to elaborate on what it is about Clinton
that's worth sending money to New York to stop.
</P>
<P>
   For David A. Bagwell, 54, a Mobile lawyer who has a son in
college and who said that for him ``$500 is a lot of money,'' the
irritation started with health care in 1993.
</P>
<P>
   ``Not only was it we know what is right and we'll tell you what
is best, it was we are going to do this in secret because you
aren't smart enough to understand,'' Bagwell said.
</P>
<P>
   Patricia Hooks, 53, whose husband owns a tugboat company in
Mobile, said she saw through Clinton the first time she saw her on
``60 Minutes'' in 1992. Hooks remembers thinking that this ``is a
woman who wants power, who wants control, who wants to be on the
national stage.''
</P>
<P>
   The four Republicans said they expected and feared that Clinton
was using the Senate race in New York as a steppingstone for a run
at the presidency. They had had their fill of Bill Clinton, they
said, and the prospect of his wife in the White House made them
furious.
</P>
<P>
   John D. Peebles, a real estate agent from Mobile, said that New
Yorkers might not be able to fathom the depth of conservative
Southern antipathy for the Clintons. He explained that many
Southerners see the president as a scalawag, someone who has
betrayed the values and traditions of the South. The president's
wife, Peebles said, has quite literally become a carpetbagger,
albeit in the North.
</P>
<P>
   ``The marriage of a scalawag and a carpetbagger,'' Peebles said.
``You cannot be more objectionable in the South.''
</P>
<P>
   Objections to Clinton, of course, are not confined to the South.
For years, polls have shown that a broad slice of the American
public cannot abide her, often for reasons that people have trouble
putting into words.
</P>
<P>
   Before Clinton became a Senate candidate, the White House
strategy for knocking down her negative ratings was to encourage
her to retreat to the shadows of public attention.
</P>
<P>
   James Carville, the longtime political adviser to the Clintons,
said the rule of thumb was, the less visible she was, the better
her numbers were in the polls.
</P>
<P>
   That rule of thumb was discovered halfway through the first
term, when Clinton's troubles with Whitewater and health care had
made her an anchor on her husband's presidency. In some polls, she
was less popular than he was.
</P>
<P>
   ``It has been difficult for Hillary to fit into the perceptions
and expectations of the role of first lady,'' said the Rev. Donald
G. Jones, her friend and her mentor when she was growing up in
Chicago. ``The office of first lady is one of the most unevolved.
Perceptions people have of it are pretty much fixed by Barbara
Bush, Nancy Reagan, Jackie Kennedy, by people who minded their own
business.''
</P>
<P>
   Jones, a professor of ethics at Drew University in Madison,
N.J., said Clinton would be relieved to shed ``the baggage that she
carried around as first lady.''
</P>
<P>
   As for the persistent percentage of Americans who view Clinton
negatively, Carville said they could no more keep her out of the
Senate than they could keep her husband out of the White House.
</P>
<P>
   ``She can win easy with a third of the voters hating her,''
Carville said, warming to the question. ``If she wins this thing,
they'll be jumping off bridges.''

MICROSOFT TRIES TO KEEP BUSINESS AS USUAL 
</HEADLINE>
 (With MICROSOFT-TRIAL, MICROSOFT-COURT) 
 By JOHN MARKOFF   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ Microsoft has long maintained that the
government antitrust case would do nothing to alter its business
practices or long-term strategy. And Tuesday, as it won at least a
procedural victory in the case, the company had another opportunity
to make its point.
</P>
<P>
   In recent months Microsoft has accelerated a range of business
and technical initiatives, continuing its strategy of adding
software applications to its operating systems _ like the browser
that brought on the antitrust scrutiny _ and moving into new
computing markets ranging from the largest mainframes to the video
game business.
</P>
<P>
   Tuesday, at a long-planned event, Microsoft and a group of
industry partners unveiled operating system software intended to
take the world's largest software publisher into the very high end
of the corporate computing market. And Microsoft executives took
the opportunity to reiterate that the antitrust suit would have no
effect on the company's aggressive strategy.
</P>
<P>
   Commenting on the Supreme Court decision on Tuesday not to take
a direct appeal of the antitrust ruling, leaving it in the hands of
the court of appeals, Steven Ballmer, Microsoft's president, said:
``I'm happy to get on with the legal process. This is really a
positive procedural step forward.''
</P>
<P>
   The stock market on Tuesday initially reacted positively to the
decision as well. The company's stock jumped up as much as 5
percent before settling back to close at $62.69, up 2.35 percent
for the day, but still near the company's 52-week low of $60.38.
</P>
<P>
   While most legal experts saw the Supreme Court's decision, which
could extend the legal process by as much as a year, as a qualified
victory for Microsoft, some noted that its effect might not be
entirely positive.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is clearly a victory for Microsoft,'' said David Yoffie,
a Harvard Business School professor, ``because the appeals court
has historically been more favorable to Microsoft.''
</P>
<P>
   But he and other analysts added that the decision could prolong
the period of uncertainty that the company faces leading to
declining employee morale and holding down the company's stock
price.
</P>
<P>
   ``This just prolongs the agony,'' said George Colony, president
of Forrester Research, a Cambridge, Mass., computer consulting
firm. ``I think they should get it over fast. I'd want
resolution.''
</P>
<P>
   Whatever agony Microsoft might be feeling, two and a half years
after the antitrust case was brought, it is nonetheless pushing
ahead on several fronts to move into new markets and consolidate
existing ones.
</P>
<P>
   In its most ambitious strategic shift since December 1995, when
it decided to ``embrace and extend'' the Internet market, the
company embarked in July on an ambitious strategy called .Net,
essentially creating a set of programs resembling an operating
system that will live on the Internet rather than on individual
desktop computers.
</P>
<P>
   Then this fall the company firmed up plans to try to compete
with videogame giants Nintendo, Sega and Sony, previewing its first
Microsoft-branded computer system, the X-box, to be sold at the end
of next year.
</P>
<P>
   On Tuesday, Microsoft added the final piece of its computing
strategy, initially sketched out by the company's former chief
technology officer, Nathan Myhrvold, almost a decade ago: to
produce operating systems stretching from the smallest handheld
computers to the most powerful supercomputers.
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft's move into the market for large corporate computer
systems, bringing it into even sharper competition with companies
like Sun Microsystems and Oracle, is viewed as a significant shift
by analysts, who said it would require a fundamental change in
Microsoft's corporate culture.
</P>
<P>
   ``Until now Microsoft's NT operating system has never made it
into the largest enterprises,'' Colony said. ``Microsoft loved to
throw software over the corporate wall and checks came back from
the other side, but they never crossed over the wall to get their
hands dirty.''
</P>
<P>
   That business approach has been why the largest computer users
such as companies like J.P. Morgan have largely ignored Microsoft's
corporate computing efforts until now.
</P>
<P>
   Ballmer said this so-called enterprise portion of Microsoft's
business already represented about $4 billion of the company's
annual revenue. Ballmer, who took over from Bill Gates as
Microsoft's chief executive earlier this year said Gates, who
remains chairman, has shifted his focus to the company's technology
strategy and has taken the title of chief software architect.
</P>
<P>
   While Microsoft's desire for new frontiers appears to be
unabated, several industry executives cautioned that even with its
dominance of operating systems and office software, the company was
bumping up against real limits.
</P>
<P>
   ``Ultimately there are only a small number of A teams at
Microsoft by definition,'' said Yoffie, ``and their ability to
conquer all areas of computing is going to be difficult or
impossible when they are fighting against other A teams.''
</P>
<P>
   Other executives said that the company's Achilles heel may be
that it is trying to accomplish too much, too quickly.
</P>
<P>
   ``What IBM had accomplished in 30 years Microsoft has taken on
in just six,'' said Andrew Heller, a former IBM executive and
computer designer. ``They haven't executed with the same level of
control and process IBM developed.''
</P>
<P>
   The company said its top-of-the-line Windows 2000 Datacenter
operating system was now available from 12 computer makers.
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft also introduced eight new server software programs
intended for electronic commerce and large system computing
applications. These programs are at the heart of the company's .Net
strategy.
</P>
<P>
   Although Ballmer was generally bullish on the company's new push
into the very highest part of the computer business, he
acknowledged that there remain some industry sectors where
Microsoft will have a tough time displacing its entrenched Unix
competitors such as Sun and Oracle.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're going to have quite an uphill battle in the next
generation telecommunications sector,'' he said. Because there has
been a strong tradition of Unix in the telecommunications network
market, which is one of the largest users of high end computers, it
will be difficult for Microsoft to break in to that market, he
said.

SCIENTISTS EXPLAIN HEATING OF SUN'S ATMOSPHERE
</HEADLINE>
  By JAMES GLANZ   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   By capturing the sharpest and most detailed pictures ever made
of the surging gases above the sun's surface, a NASA satellite may
have discovered the source of one of the most enduring mysteries in
astronomy: what makes the sun's extended atmosphere, or corona,
hundreds of times hotter than its surface, the only apparent source
of heat.
</P>
<P>
   The pictures suggest that the corona's energy may emante from
spectacular pillars of fiery gas near the sun's surface, at the
bottoms of looping arches of magnetic field _ like those produced
by a bar magnet, only larger _ that stretch for hundreds of
thousands of miles above the surface. Hot gases then seem to
explode along the magnetic fields and heat the corona.
</P>
<P>
   The images from the satellite, called Trace, for Transition
Region and Coronal Explorer, were presented by NASA administrator
Daniel S. Goldin on Tuesday in New York. The results will also be
in the Oct. 10 issue of the Astrophysical Journal in a paper by Dr.
Markus J. Aschwanden, Dr. Richard W. Nightingale and Dr. David
Alexander, astronomers at the Lockheed Martin Technology Center in
Palo Alto, Calif.
</P>
<P>
   Goldin said the results brought astronomers closer to solving a
mystery that has baffled them since they first determined the
corona's temperature more than half a century ago. ``We're finding
that the heating is going in right at the base of these arcs,''
Goldin said.
</P>
<P>
   Those results, Aschwanden said, seemed to refute theories that
had predicted the loops were heated uniformly along their length,
like toaster wires, by electrical currents or waves along the
magnetic fields.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have now the location,'' Aschwanden said. ``It's like if
you have a forest fire _ if you don't know where the fire started,
you don't know how it happened.''
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Spiros Antiochos, an astrophysicist at the Naval Research
Laboratory, said he hoped the results would break ``a logjam in
understanding what is going on.''
</P>
<P>
   The sun is powered by nuclear reactions in its core and has a
surface temperature of about 6,000 degrees. Unlike Earth's
atmosphere, which cools with height, the corona has a temperature
of at least a million degrees. The corona is normally invisible,
but appears as a shimmering halo during solar eclipses.
</P>
<P>
   Astronomers have long suspected that the magnetic fields above
the sun's surface are somehow involved in the heating. The magnetic
fields are generated by churning electrified gases, called plasma,
deep beneath the surface of the sun. Those fields bob through the
surface and form the vast arches seen by the solar telescope aboard
Trace, which NASA sent into space in 1998.
</P>
<P>
   The bottoms, or ``footpoints'' of those arches continue to be
shuffled about by gases at the surface. Antiochos said that the
solar bonfires found by Trace may be sparked by interactions
between magnetic loops as the footpoints crash together. He said
that even finer observations would be needed to be certain that
such interactions were setting off the fiery pillars.

   Before the Hollywood Pictures unit of Disney released the
R-rated Sylvester Stallone movie ``Judge Dredd,'' about urban
anarchy and street war, the studio tested the film before a focus
group that included more than 100 youths ages 13 to 16.
</P>
<P>
   MGM/United Artists tested commercials for ``Disturbing
Behavior,'' an R-rated horror thriller about troublemaking
teen-agers transformed into upstanding citizens, before more than
400 12- to 20-year-olds. A survey reported that they felt the
``standout scene'' was one of a blonde bashing her head into a
mirror.
</P>
<P>
   Columbia Tristar's researchers interviewed 50 children ages 9 to
11 to evaluate concepts for the sequel to ``I Know What You Did
Last Summer,'' a tale of a serial slasher equipped with an outsized
ice hook.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is evidence to indicate that attendance in the original
movie dipped down to the age of 10,'' explained a memorandum from
the National Research Group, the dominant market research
organization for major studios. ``Therefore, it seems to make sense
to interview 10- to 11-year-olds.''
</P>
<P>
   These incidents and others are recorded in confidential
marketing documents submitted by nine movie studios to the
government commission that investigated the marketing of violent
entertainment to children. Those documents show that some of the
biggest companies in Hollywood routinely recruited scores of
teen-agers and children as young as 9 to evaluate story concepts,
commercials, theatrical trailers and rough cuts for R-rated movies.
</P>
<P>
   Tuesday, the movie industry's trade association, the Motion
Picture Association of America, announced steps to restrict its
marketing of R-rated films to under-age children. Among them is a
pledge not to use children under 17 in test screenings unless they
are accompanied by an adult. An R-rated movie requires that anyone
under 17 be accompanied by an adult because of explicit violent or
sexual content. The rating, like all movie ratings, is the
industry's own standard, subject only to its own policing.
</P>
<P>
   Jack Valenti, the MPAA chairman, said a report by the Federal
Trade Commission had prompted studios to take ``a fresh new look at
the way we market films.''
</P>
<P>
   The industry's program is the latest consequence of the FTC's
sharply critical report on marketing practices in the movie, music
and video-game industries. Citing regulations prohibiting it from
releasing trade secrets, the report did not reveal the names of the
entertainment companies involved or the details of the marketing
campaigns.
</P>
<P>
   Those are contained in the supporting documents, which were
obtained by The New York Times.
</P>
<P>
   Eight movie studio executives are scheduled to testify Wednesday
before the Senate Commerce Committee about their policies. At the
first committee hearing, two weeks ago, Valenti conceded that
perhaps marketing people ``stepped over the line'' but argued that
the location of that line was ``ill lit, hazily observed.''
</P>
<P>
   Valenti maintained that ``we are not dealing with Euclid's
geometry where the equations are pristine and explicit.''
</P>
<P>
   When asked about the confidential marketing reports Tuesday,
Valenti said, ``I didn't know it was happening.'' He added that the
``practice of going to 10- and 12-year-olds is really not
acceptable.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   In their own marketing plans submitted to the FTC the major
movie studios offered a window into practices that can begin almost
as soon as a movie is conceived. Preliminary test screenings are
conducted months before films appear in theaters.
</P>
<P>
   Recruiters hunt for moviegoers in the lines outside cinemas or
malls offering free tickets to people who match the age and ethnic
profile set by the studios. And the results ultimately can shape
promotions, advertising and decisions for a movie sequel.
</P>
<P>
   In some of the memorandums describing marketing strategy, movie
studios and video-game makers acknowledged that while they have
publicly identified 18- to 34-year-olds as their primary audience
for restricted movies and games, they needed the support of young
teen-agers. Toy tie-ins to PG-13 movies, which caution that violent
material may be ``inappropriate'' for children under 13, broaden
the promotion of those films to children as young as 4.
</P>
<P>
   The main company that gathers marketing information for major
movie studios is National Research Group of Los Angeles. Joseph
Farrell, the company's co-chairman, said that information is
gathered in a variety of ways, including telephone surveys and test
screenings of movies, commercials and theatrical trailers.
</P>
<P>
   ``All of the specifications that we carry out, including the
methodology involving focus groups, are prescribed by the
studios,'' said Farrell, who noted that no one under 12 is
``approached or interviewed or involved in discussions without a
parent's permission.''
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   For test screenings, younger people are accompanied by parents,
Farrell said. He described the process of gathering information
from focus groups of younger children as unusual.
</P>
<P>
   In its report, the FTC examined 44 R-rated films and 20 violent
PG-13 films distributed by the nine major studios over a four-year
period ending in 1999. Thirty-three of the 44 R-rated films or
advertisements for them were screened for under-age teen-agers and
children as young as 9.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know anything about that,'' Farrell said of that
conclusion.
</P>
<P>
   In the aftermath of the FTC report, Disney announced earlier
this month that it would not show R-rated films from any of its
units to focus groups with participants under 17 and would urge
theaters to more strictly enforce age restrictions.
</P>
<P>
   In the past, that was not the case. Marketing plans from the
company's units, Touchstone and Hollywood Pictures, show that the
studio has turned to younger children for market research on
R-rated films.
</P>
<P>
   In the case of ``Judge Dredd,'' Hollywood Pictures tested the
1995 film with a broad group that included a subset of 13- to
16-year-olds. The participants were asked to rate everything from
the movie's music and action to the film's ending and its hero,
played by Stallone. Participants also rated every movie scene, from
a robot ripping off a man's arms to a prison plane crash.
</P>
<P>
   Later, the company's researchers tested the movie's five
commercials before 1,800 people, who included participants as young
as 12. And those surveys, along with the earlier movie ratings,
detected a clear pattern of enthusiasm among one age group: young
teen-agers, particularly males.
</P>
<P>
   In 1998, Disney's Touchstone Pictures also turned to younger
viewers to test the appeal of trailers for an R-rated thriller,
``Enemy of the State,'' which starred Will Smith. One focus group
of 300 people included participants ages 12 to 14, according to a
research report. In addition, the company gathered a second group
of 300 African-Americans, which also included participants as young
as 12. The aim of the survey was to test the power of the movie's
trailers. That information would then provide critical insight
about which people were most likely to go to the movie.
</P>
<P>
   John Dreyer, a spokesman for Disney, said he could not explain
why Disney had used younger people for marketing research.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wasn't really privy to the decision-making,'' he said,
adding, ``I think there were probably exceptions or aberrations,
that clearly there were mistakes made, and there's a commitment not
to do it again.''
</P>
<P>
   Marketing plans for other films show the meticulous efforts made
by major movie studios to gauge the tastes of younger, often
under-age moviegoers.
</P>
<P>
   When Columbia Tristar tested concepts for the 1998 teen slasher
sequel, ``I Still Know What You Did Last Summer,'' it commissioned
research from a sample group of 500 people who had seen the
original movie.
</P>
<P>
   The sample was made up of 500 people 12 to 24. Of those, 100
were 9 to 11. In addition, researchers interviewed a group of 150
Latinos and African-Americans ages 12 to 24, and 50 more ages 9 to
11.
</P>
<P>
   The goal, as outlined in a memorandum from National Research
Group, was plain: ``to determine who are the most intense fans of
the movie by age, gender, ethnicity, et cetera, and what drives
their zeal. The results will help define the primary and secondary
targets and what about the movie most appeals to them. It will also
provide information on the key aspects of the original movie most
liked and guidance for direction of the second movie.''
</P>
<P>
   In 1997, Columbia was even more aggressive about targeting a
younger audience for the futuristic science-fiction thriller ``The
Fifth Element,'' a PG-13 film starring Bruce Willis as a 23rd
century cabdriver turned galactic hero.
</P>
<P>
   The studio sought to advertise the movie on the children's
network Nickelodeon. MTV Networks, which oversees Nickelodeon,
refused to allow an advertisement because it considered the movie
inappropriate for its viewers, who are mostly under 12.
</P>
<P>
   (NOTE LANGUAGE IN FOLLOWING GRAF)
</P>
<P>
   ``There are several gun battles, a couple of fight sequences and
some devastating bomb blasts,'' an MTV executive wrote to
representatives of Columbia. ``Finally the sexual situations are
well removed from Nickelodeon's sphere _ the talk show host
performing cunnilingus on a female singer.''
</P>
<P>
   The studio then unsuccessfully appealed the ban, arguing in part
that the science-fiction genre required a suspension of belief and
that the violence would be suspect to ``the children of today who
are more sophisticated.'' In addition, they noted in a memorandum:
``This film needs the audience that Nickelodeon provides to be
successful.''
</P>
<P>
   The quest for the under-17 market reflects certain realities of
moviegoing habits. Studies from the Motion Picture Association of
America indicate, for example, that the group ages 12 to 17
accounts for 17 percent of movie audiences, a figure
disproportionate to their actual share of the population, which is
10 percent.
</P>
<P>
   When MGM/United Artists was preparing to release its R-rated
film ``Disturbing Behavior'' in 1998, researchers started tracking
the interest and awareness among a sample of 331 10- to
20-year-olds and a broader group of 400 12- to 59-year-olds.
</P>
<P>
   Later, the studio screened two 30-second commercials among 438
moviegoers 12 to 20. In a scene-by-scene rating of the commercials,
viewers evaluated such fleeting moments as a ``needle toward
clamped eye'' and a girl bashing her head into a mirror.
</P>
<P>
   ``The stand-out scenes continue to be the blonde hitting her
head in the mirror,'' the researchers reported, ``Also enjoyed are
scenes of Holmes in confrontation with a strange man being menaced.
All of these factors lead to stronger performance of the
commercials among 15- to 17-year-olds. Those 18 to 24 remain
hesitant about the horror focus of the story.''
</P>
<P>
   A year ago, Universal Studios outlined its preparations to
promote the PG-13 movie ``The Mummy,'' which includes elements of
suggested violence, like a knifing murder in the shadows and the
mummy's theft of the eyeballs and tongue of a hapless victim.
</P>
<P>
   The movie's target audience consisted of two groups: frequent
moviegoers 12 to 34 and male fans of action films 10 to 24. To
reach the ``tweens,'' as the memorandum labeled the younger set,
the company created a plan to advertise on television shows that
attract extremely young viewers, like ``Pokemon,'' ``Power
Rangers'' and ``Spiderman.''
</P>
<P>
   The target market for Universal's ``Mummy'' merchandising
program was even younger: boys 4 to 14. The company developed plans
to distribute 6-inch action figures and 12-inch collector mummies
at Toys R Us, K-Mart and Target.
</P>
<P>
   To cap the marketing blitz, Universal Studios in Florida built a
haunted house maze for Halloween last year that included a mummy
character. The marketing report noted the potential impact:
``250,000 kids expected.''
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps the most blunt and candid appraisal of the youthful
audience for violent entertainment comes in two marketing
memorandums for restricted video games called ``Turok'' and ``Duke
Nukem Zero Hour,'' which features a foul-mouthed alien-annihilator
who, according to promotional material, is notable for ``spitting
more one-liners than Rodney Dangerfield while building the body
count.'' Both carry an ``M'' rating, which bars their sale to
children under 17.
</P>
<P>
   Advertising recommendations for ``Duke'' from GT Interactive
Software's 1998 marketing plan observe that because of the
restricted M rating for the video the target audience is identified
as males 17 to 34. ``The true target is males 9 to 34,'' the report
adds.
</P>
<P>
   A year after the memorandum was prepared, GT Interactive was
acquired by Infogrames Inc., a French company with offices in San
Jose, Calif.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's not the way we approach the marketing of mature
games,'' said Tom Richardson, a spokesman for Infogrames, ``That
doesn't reflect our philosophy. We make every effort to market
mature themes to mature audiences 17 and over.''
</P>
<P>
   In another marketing plan, Acclaim Entertainment, the makers of
the M-rated ``Turok'' series, explains why the primary audience for
the video remains males aged 12 to 17, even though these consumers
cannot buy the material by themselves. The ``Turok'' series has
sold more than 3 million units on the strength of weapons features
like the ``all-powerful Chest-Burster.''
</P>
<P>
   ```Turok' has an M rating, which may discourage parents from
buying the game and hinder clearance of a commercial airing in
shows primarily for children under 12,'' observed the marketing
report. ``However, the younger the audience, the more likely they
are to be influenced by TV advertising. Adults are more likely to
evaluate software purchases based on more extensive research.''

SPRINT SEARCHES FOR JOBS FOR 300 WHOSE POSITIONS ARE BEING
ELIMINATED 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By SUZANNE KING  
 c. 2000 Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   A Sprint Corp. division based in Houston will eliminate 300
positions that no longer fit the company's ``strategic direction,''
a spokeswoman said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   The computer help-desk employees who work with clients of
Sprint's Enterprise Network Services Group, formerly Sprint
Paranet, will be moved into other jobs within Sprint or hired by
the client company they support, said Laura Lisec, a Sprint
spokeswoman.
</P>
<P>
   The ENS group employs about 2,000 people.
</P>
<P>
   Lisec said the company had found new jobs for half the employees
and was looking for jobs for the others.
</P>
<P>
   A transition period will prevent any of the employees from being
out of work, Lisec said. But where jobs have been identified,
employees will be moved as early as next week.
</P>
<P>
   ``We'll find them positions,'' Lisec said.
</P>
<P>
   She did not know if displaced employees would be offered jobs in
the city of their existing jobs. But she said every effort would be
made to make that happen.
</P>
<P>
   Sprint acquired Paranet Inc. for $375 million in 1997 as a
ticket into the computer network management business. Paranet
helped companies integrate complicated voice and data networks. ENS
performs a similar function.
</P>
<P>
   But Lisec said Sprint wanted to back away from the support piece
of the business. The company is doing away with computer help-desk
jobs at client sites across the country.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's just basically because it doesn't fit with our strategic
direction, and it's not a part of the business that we consider to
be growing,'' Lisec said.
</P>
<P>
   She said Sprint had not determined how the support duties would
be handled when the positions are eliminated. But the company could
probably cut costs by outsourcing the work, sources said.
</P>
<P>
   News of the cuts Tuesday came the same day Sprint's FON stock
hit a 12-month low of $24.31. The stock closed at $25. Sprint's PCS
stock, which tracks the Westwood company's wireless business,
closed at $31.50.
</P>
<P>
   At the height of Sprint's merger plans with WorldCom Inc., the
FON stock spiked at $75.94. But since the merger was called off in
July, the stock price has been low.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, Sprint warned investors that its third-quarter profit
would be less than expected. Company officials said they expected
earnings of 45 cents to 47 cents a share.
</P>
<P>
   One industry source said the job cuts could be a reflection of
that news.
</P>
<P>
   ``Overall, when a company misses earnings, they look for places
to cut,'' he said. ``Economically, 300 jobs is not a big deal. But
it's a start in something.''
</P>
<P>
   Jeanne Schaaf, senior analyst with Forrester Research in
Cambridge, Mass., said she had not heard about the job cuts at ENS,
but she speculated that they might offer a window into the
company's future sans WorldCom.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's got to be part of a bigger plan, and I don't know what
the bigger plan is,'' she said.

FBI TRACKS IMPACT OF CYBER CRIMES 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DAVID HAYES  
 c. 2000 Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   KANSAS CITY, Mo. _ Computer hackers, computer espionage,
telephone fraud and other computer crimes cost area companies more
than $20 million in 1999, according to an FBI survey released
Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   In the first survey of its kind of metropolitan area companies,
corporate computer security specialists told the FBI that hackers
stole proprietary information, sabotaged systems and vandalized Web
sites. Three companies said they had each lost more than $5 million
to computer hacking or fraud.
</P>
<P>
   Eight companies said attacks on their systems resulted in the
theft of proprietary information.
</P>
<P>
   The results were based on anonymous surveys completed by 189
Kansas City area companies earlier this year. More than one in four
of those companies said their computer systems had been hacked in
the prior 12 months.
</P>
<P>
   ``When a lot of people think of security, it's guns, gates and
guards,'' said Scott Williams, supervisory special agent for the
FBI's Kansas City cyber crimes office. ``People need to be thinking
that it's guns, gates, guards and computers.''
</P>
<P>
   The FBI office in Kansas City has about 20 open computer crime
cases, Williams said.
</P>
<P>
   It was not, however, the number of hack attacks or the financial
loss that caught Williams off guard. More troubling, he said, was
that 11.8 percent of the 189 companies did not know whether their
computer systems had been attacked.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's like not locking the doors on your store,'' Williams
said. ``You have to take the same precautions in the cyber world.
Many of us have come to rely on computer equipment to the degree
that we've forgotten how to handle things manually.''
</P>
<P>
   The survey results were tabulated by Central Missouri State
University.
</P>
<P>
   The survey was released as the FBI office in Kansas City met
with 95 computer security professionals to establish a local
chapter of InfraGard, an FBI-sponsored networking group designed to
allow computer professionals to meet and discuss security problems.
The group was formed in Cleveland, and chapters are operating in
other cities.
</P>
<P>
   Williams said large companies seemed to be willing to accept
large computer-related losses. He said, however, that a large
number of smaller companies in the Kansas City survey reported that
they had lost up to $100,000. Those companies do not have the
resources to handle that type of loss, or deal with hackers, he
said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Those are the ones we have to protect,'' Williams said.
</P>
<P>
   An executive with Kansas City Power &AMP; Light Co. gave a more
personal view at the session.
</P>
<P>
   Larry Dolci, head of security for KCP&AMP;L, said the utility
formerly had workers open and close switches controlling the power
grid. Those switches now are controlled by computer. And those
computers are regularly under attack.

   Hackers at ``5,000 different (Internet) sites come at KCP&AMP;L
every month,'' using automated scans to try to break into the
utility's computers, Dolci said. ``It's just constant, 24 hours a
day.''
</P>
<P>
   Dolci said KCP&AMP;L had joined InfraGard, and he urged other
companies to join.
</P>
<P>
   David Black, manager of research and development for Kansas
City-based eSecurityOnline.com, called the group ``definitely a
must.''
</P>
<P>
   ``You'll know someone in that group who is going to have the
same problem as you, and you can compare notes,'' Black said.
</P>
<P>
   Williams said it was difficult to determine how much Kansas City
companies had lost to computer hackers.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's more than $20 million a year; beyond that it's difficult
to come up with a figure,'' Williams said. ``It's in the tens of
millions in the KC area alone.''
</P>
<P>
   One company the FBI works with reports that hackers hit its
computer system 100,000 times every month.
</P>
<P>
   A nationwide survey earlier this year by the Computer Security
Institute and the FBI found that 643 companies reported losing $265
million to computer hackers in 1999. The number has been escalating
each year for the past four years.
</P>
<P>
   Incidents of sabotage tripled in the last year.
</P>
<P>
   About 50 of the 189 companies in the Kansas City survey said
their computer systems had been hacked, and more than a third of
those said their systems had been hacked six or more times in the
last 12 months. The companies said the attacks came both from
outside and inside the company.
</P>
<P>
   More than 75 percent of the companies that responded to the
survey said they were concerned that their computer systems would
be hacked.
</P>
<P>
   Most companies said they had not reported computer attacks to
law enforcement agencies, citing reasons ranging from bad publicity
to not being aware that the federal agency would be interested.
</P>
<P>
   ``Intrusions are rarely reported; people are very afraid of
negative publicity,'' said Stan Paulson, an FBI intelligence
analyst from Cleveland.
</P>
<P>
   The FBI and Central Missouri State will repeat the survey in
February, said Richard D. Sluder, a professor and director of
special projects for the College of Education and Human Services at
the university.

MOTHER, DAUGHTER SHARE OLYMPIC GOLDEN MOMENT 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MIKE DeARMOND  
 c. 2000 Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   BLACKTOWN, Australia _ Moments after the U.S. softball team
clinched an Olympic gold medal with a 2-1 victory over Japan, the
Australian heavens opened up and turned the field and grounds into
a sea of mud.
</P>
<P>
   Slogging through it, to the edge of the right-field seats, U.S.
left fielder Christie Ambrosi blew a kiss to her mother, Mimi, and
yelled, ``I love you!''
</P>
<P>
   Mimi Ambrosi had given so much to see this moment in person: her
youngest daughter winning an Olympic gold medal. Mimi had sold her
house in Overland Park, Kan., to finance the trip for herself and
her sister, Carol Briant.
</P>
<P>
   As the rain fell, so did tears of joy down Mimi Ambrosi's face.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would give up my life for this moment,'' she said Tuesday as
Christie mounted the medal podium with the rest of her teammates.
``She is so special. We've both come so far.''
</P>
<P>
   Mimi Ambrosi was speaking in terms of time and near tragedy, not
the miles between Kansas City, Mo., and the land Down Under. While
an athlete at Blue Valley Northwest High School, Christie Ambrosi
was so upset by circumstances that led to her parents' separation
and later divorce that she was hospitalized for depression.
</P>
<P>
   On this night, however, mother and daughter shared the
sweetness, no matter how hard the wind blew or the rain fell.
</P>
<P>
   In left field, Ambrosi had tracked down a line drive off the bat
of Japan's designated hitter, Haruka Saito, to open the game,
making a running catch.
</P>
<P>
   Sure, there was the cocklebur for Ambrosi of having been allowed
to play only defense the last two games of the Olympic tournament,
replaced in the batting order by designated hitter Michele Smith.
But that dissolved with the victory.
</P>
<P>
   And afterward, daughter and mother explained how deep their bond
ran.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wouldn't be here if it wasn't for my mom,'' Christie said.
``With everything that we've been through together, she's an
inspiration to me. I just get choked up even thinking about my
mom.''
</P>
<P>
   Mimi Ambrosi, who sat in the front of the American cheering
section, said: ``I live for my kids. I've got three kids, and this
is my baby. She has done it all herself.
</P>
<P>
   ``My son is 30; my other daughter is 27. Christie's 23. I have a
granddaughter that's 2 and one on the way. I've got everything.''
</P>
<P>
   What Mimi Ambrosi has back in Overland Park now is a one-bedroom
apartment. She was unable to arrange a loan to take the trip, so
she decided to sell her home.
</P>
<P>
   She had fixed it up that just the way she wanted it, for her
retirement.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a great house,'' she said. ``I made it great. I did
everything. I did floors, walls. I knocked down walls. I made a
beautiful home.''
</P>
<P>
   A house, however, was nothing compared with where her heart told
her she had to be this September. Christie, on tour with the U.S.
team all summer, was not supposed to know about the sacrifice her
mother made.
</P>
<P>
   ``Somehow it got out,'' Mimi said. ``She found out and was very
upset.''
</P>
<P>
   Said Christie: ``I yelled at her.''
</P>
<P>
   What kind of a woman sells her house so she can afford to watch
a softball tournament?
</P>
<P>
   ``My mom,'' Ambrosi crowed. ``A great parent, a wonderful parent
who would do anything for her children.''
</P>
<P>
   The long summer tour was tough enough. But it was made harder by
legal challenges brought by players not selected to the Olympic
team. Sorting that out required two reselections of the team, with
Ambrosi sweating out each.
</P>
<P>
   She wondered whether sacrificing her final year of eligibility
at the University of California at Los Angeles, whether her
mother's sacrifice of her home, could be for naught. Not until
August was the roster final.
</P>
<P>
   ``The only thing that kept me going through the summer was my
mom,'' Ambrosi said.
</P>
<P>
   She acknowledged being devastated when the U.S. team lost three
straight round-robin games in the Olympic medal-round qualifying.
She was the would-be hero in the third loss, 2-1 to Australia,
having singled in the Americans' run in the top of the 13th inning.
</P>
<P>
   A two-run home run by Australia's Peta Edebone in the bottom of
the inning extended the American losing streak to three games. The
last time the U.S. team had lost three games in a row had been a
1982-83 stretch.
</P>
<P>
   The Americans, however, rallied for five straight victories,
getting moral support along the way from the U.S. baseball team,
including manager Tommy Lasorda, and the U.S. women's soccer team,
including stars Mia Hamm and Brandi Chastain. They came to games to
cheer the softball team.
</P>
<P>
   After the gold-medal game, players, relatives and friends
huddled in the lightning and drizzle to make plans for celebrating.
And the Ambrosis talked about this being the third gold medal won
by a Kansas City area athlete at these Olympics.
</P>
<P>
   Tara Nott won the first in weightlifting. Maurice Greene won the
second in track. Now it was Christie's turn for gold.
</P>
<P>
   Mimi Ambrosi supplied a final perspective.
</P>
<P>
   ``My house-selling was happy,'' she said. ``Who cares I'm in an
apartment? I've got all these great things. Nobody can have this.
</P>
<P>
   ``She threw me a kiss and said, `I love you.' We knew. We
knew.''

A TOP TARGET OF DEMOCRATS IN SENATE APPEARS UNBOWED 
</HEADLINE>
   By FRANCIS X. CLINES   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   HARRISBURG, Pa. _ The Democrats' high-priority targeting of Sen.
Rick Santorum for defeat this year is proving to be an uphill
struggle so far for his challenger, Rep. Ron Klink.
</P>
<P>
   After a divisive primary fight, Klink has had trouble raising
the television money he needs for the expensive Philadelphia and
eastern state markets. These are Democratic strongholds, yet polls
show two-thirds of the voters do not recognize the name of Klink, a
Democrat from western Pennsylvania. But the congressman insists he
will soon have the traction for a homestretch victory.
</P>
<P>
   In contrast, Santorum, with at least eight times the war chest
of his challenger, has taken to the tube with ease all over the
state for much of this month. His mellow, family-man ads of the
``pop up'' sort seen on music cable channels are designed to take
the bite off his early political image as a House iconoclast and
Newt Gingrich acolyte.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's got this multimillion-dollar fog machine out there making
him look like a Kennedy Democrat,'' complains Klink, a four-term
House member from the steel mill region near Pittsburgh who has
struggled to heal the wounds from his primary victory. ``The most
frustrating thing for me is the money,'' he admits while buoyed
that Senate Democrats who find Santorum personally abrasive have
begun lending a fund-raising hand in the hope of cutting the
Republicans' 54-to-46 advantage in the Senate.
</P>
<P>
   Citing a roll of 30,000 donors, Santorum is busy raising even
more television money as a campaign ``imperative'' now that his
double-digit polling lead shows some possible wavering. His
treasury exceeded $10 million even as Klink, a former television
news reporter, labored for his first $1 million after taking a
mortgage on his home to win the primary.
</P>
<P>
   ``Ron Klink is running the Democrats' prepackaged campaign that
we're all right-wing Gingrich nuts,'' Santorum complained,
insisting he had spent the past six years proving otherwise in a
mix of intense constituent services and carefully chosen causes,
like his prominent sponsorship of a welfare overhaul.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's more Rick Santorum in that legislation than anybody
else in the House or Senate,'' said Santorum, a 42-year-old senator
who had a former welfare mother introduce him at a Republican
dinner here and tell of her new career as a teacher.
</P>
<P>
   For all the underdog hobbles of 49-year-old Klink, his spirits
are rising after a parched summer of fund-raising. His perceived
statewide strength is that like Santorum, he is anti-abortion and
anti-gun control. But this has not served him well in seeking the
donations of liberal Democrats.
</P>
<P>
   But an emergency infusion of $800,000 from the Senate Democratic
campaign committee in Washington is buying him his first two weeks
of television commercial time, with more aid likely. ``The odds are
shortening,'' a Senate Democratic worker insisted.
</P>
<P>
   Democrats hope Vice President Al Gore's rise in popularity will
energize the Democrats' 500,000-voter edge in state registration
and propel Klink toward an upset. But, as a House member, Santorum
showed strong resistance to the coat-tail effect in 1992 when his
heavily Democratic district voted only 30 percent for President
George Bush while Santorum was re-elected by 61 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Emboldened by Gore's surge in this swing state, Klink maintains
he will win because his party has the more popular positions on the
most urgent issues. But state analysts say there is no sign yet
that Klink is scoring significantly with his opposition to
Santorum's proposals to privatize some Social Security investment
and to use health maintenance organizations in dealing with the
prescription drug problem.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Democrats grossly underestimated what a good politician
Rick Santorum is,'' said Jennifer Duffy, the Senate editor for the
Cook Political Report, a Washington newsletter that tracks
campaigns. ``He's taken a solid step toward the center,'' said
Duffy, referring to what Democrats denounce as Santorum wiles.
</P>
<P>
   These include the senator's slight moderation on gun control in
accepting trigger locks, despite his 100 percent rating from the
National Rifle Association. Democrats also underline as cynical the
quiet demeanor of Santorum, in contrast to his signature brashness,
when President Clinton's impeachment trial proved unpopular with
the public.
</P>
<P>
   In their first debate, Klink pressed the fact that Santorum once
voted for a resolution that included raising the retirement age to
70. The senator said this was part of a larger omnibus package to
control entitlement programs and that he had since opposed any age
change.
</P>
<P>
   ``Klink is running as a little Gore and his message is getting
sharper, more populist,'' said G. Terry Madonna, the political
science chairman at Millersville University in Lancaster, who
conducts the Keystone Poll. ``The polls have been tightening, but
Klink still needs to get his name recognition much higher.''
</P>
<P>
   The congressman accuses the senator of having tried to head off
this contest by letting three of his top staff aides work for the
Republican challenger two years ago in Klink's re-election campaign
for the House. The senator scoffs at this as routine politicking
and questions whether ``there's some personal vendetta'' driving
the congressman.
</P>
<P>
   There seems no love lost between the two politicians, and both
are proven battlers who upset incumbents with aggressive campaigns
in their first campaigns for House seats.
</P>
<P>
   ``This has been a productive six years and has given me a lot of
pride and confidence,'' Santorum said, sounding far from the
vulnerable incumbent at the top of the Democrats' target list.
``We've earned another six years.''
</P>
<P>
   Klink sounds no less confident. ``People are focusing now on the
issues, and we're in this ballgame,'' he maintains with his old
anchorman timbre. ``Santorum has taken extremely conservative,
far-out positions, and he cannot run away from his record.''

AUCTION HOUSES   APPROVE $512 MILLION SETTLEMENT 
</HEADLINE>
   By CAROL VOGEL    
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Christie's announced on Wednesday that it had approved a $256
million settlement of civil claims that, along with its archrival,
Sotheby's, it cheated buyers and sellers as far back as 1992.
Forty-eight hours earlier, Sotheby's disclosed that its board
approved its half of the $512 million settlement.
</P>
<P>
   But unlike Sotheby's, whose former chairman and majority
shareholder A. Alfred Taubman is paying $156 million of the auction
house's $256 million payment, Christie's said in a written
statement on Wednesday that the auction house together with its
parent company, Christie's International, is coming up with all the
money itself.
</P>
<P>
   While Sotheby's is a publicly traded company, Christie's was
taken private two years ago when it was bought by Francois Pinault,
the French takeover investor, for $1.2 billion.
</P>
<P>
   Both auction houses are able to use $50 million of their
payments in the form of certificates issued to clients toward
future consignments.
</P>
<P>
   Christie's chief executive, Edward J. Dolman, said the
settlement ``will have no impact on our operations,'' yet auction
house experts say that the $256 million is bound to affect its
financial health. In the three years before it went private,
Christie's reported pretax profits of a little more than half of
its $256 million payment.
</P>
<P>
   Andree Corroon, a spokeswoman for Christie's, declined to
comment on where the auction house will get its financing.
</P>
<P>
   The civil class-action lawsuit grew out of a three-year-old
federal antitrust investigation contending that top officials from
the two auction houses colluded on an array of business practices
including fixing the prices it charges buyers and sellers.

HUNTER CONTROVERSY AT TIP OF BIGGER DISPUTE
</HEADLINE>
 By JERE LONGMAN   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   SYDNEY _ As the shot-putter C. J. Hunter, husband of Marion
Jones, denies that he knowingly took banned substances, the entire
system of drug testing in the United States has come under fire
from the international Olympic hierarchy. These international
officials consider the Americans hypocritical, laggard and
deceptive in their handling of doping cases.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. officials are firing back in what has become the newest
Olympic sport: verbal skeet shooting. The recrimination has
symbolized the messy state of drug testing internationally and the
lack of trust and cooperation undermining renewed efforts to curb
the widespread use of performance-enhancing drugs.
</P>
<P>
   For years, members of the International Olympic Committee have
suspected that U.S. officials have been covering up positive drug
tests, even as the Americans have criticized the international
committee for its own deficiencies and lack of willpower to catch
cheating athletes.
</P>
<P>
   Over the past two years, the IOC has absorbed a battering from
Congress, the White House, corporate sponsors and the news media on
the issues of corruption in the Salt Lake City bribery scandal and
of its suspect resolve on doping.
</P>
<P>
   On Monday, a published report here said that Hunter had tested
positive for the steroid nandrolone in July in Oslo, and the IOC
was quick to confirm the story. On Tuesday, the committee said that
Hunter had tested positive four times this summer for the steroid.
</P>
<P>
   Hunter, who is America's top shot-putter but did not compete
here because of a knee injury, is also the husband of Jones, the
most visible U.S. athlete at these Olympics. She has won a gold at
100 meters and is going for gold in four other track and field
events
</P>
<P>
   The IOC made Hunter's case an issue and sent a harsh message to
U.S. Olympic and track officials: Don't complain about the rest of
the world until you address your own problems.
</P>
<P>
   ``We feel, yes, it's OK to criticize,'' said Gerhard Heiberg, an
IOC delegate from Norway. ``At the same time we feel your house is
not in order. We feel you do not tell us the truth what is
happening in the United States. You want us to be open instead of
sweeping everything under the carpet. That has to go for the U.S.
as well. We're a little irritated.''
</P>
<P>
   At a news conference on Tuesday, Hunter said that he had not
taken any performance-enhancing steroids. He said nutritional
supplements, which he called improperly labeled and packaged with
quality-control problems, had led to the positive drug tests.
</P>
<P>
   Athletes are warned repeatedly not to take nutritional
supplements for this very reason.
</P>
<P>
   The supplements are classified as food and not as a drug, and as
such are not regulated by the Food and Drug Administration.
Steroids, which can improve performance by allowing athletes to
train harder, can legally be sold in supplements even if not
labeled, as long as no medical claim is made, said Dr. Don Catlin,
who operates the Olympic drug-testing laboratory at University of
California in Los Angeles and is a member of the IOC's doping
agency.
</P>
<P>
   At the Olympics, if an athlete takes a banned substance, that
athlete can be suspended, even if the substance was ingested
inadvertently. Andreea Raducan was stripped of her gold medal in
the gymnastics' all-around competition after she had tested
positive for a banned stimulant included in a cold medicine given
to her by the Romanian team doctor.
</P>
<P>
   Nandrolone, for which Hunter tested positive, has been easily
detectable for many years. Recently, though, the steroid has been
showing up in a number of positive tests involving high-profile
athletes. Improperly labeled nutritional supplements may have
caused the positive tests, but that does not exonerate the
athletes, scientists said.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's buyer beware,'' Catlin said. ``If it's in your body, you
take responsibility.''
</P>
<P>
   Also at issue is why Hunter's positive tests were not revealed
until now. The International Amateur Athletic Federation, which
governs track and field, says Hunter was suspended on Aug. 24, yet
USA Track and Field has yet to make that announcement.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Arne Ljungqvist, an IOC delegate from Sweden and the chief
medical officer of track and field's world governing body, has
criticized the U.S. track and field federation for what he called a
failure to report in a timely manner 12 to 15 positive drug tests
in the past two years.
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Not all of the criticism of American drug-testing procedures has
come from outside the United States. Dr. Robert S. Voy and Dr. Wade
Exum, the past two medical directors of the USOC, have both
criticized the Olympic committee for what they say is a lack of
resolve in catching drug cheats. Exum has claimed in a lawsuit that
as many as half of the American athletes who have tested positive
have gone unpunished.
</P>
<P>
   The USOC has denied the allegation. It will, however, have its
drug testing conducted by an independent agency after these games.
Dick Pound, a member of the IOC executive board and the chairman of
its World Anti-Doping Agency, suggested that if the USOC were
serious, it would have begun independent testing before the Sydney
Olympics, not after.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   The public attack on the Americans has caused U.S. officials to
respond with equally caustic remarks. Prince Alexandre de Merode of
Belgium, the IOC's medical director, has said that five American
athletes had been permitted to compete at the 1988 Summer Games in
Seoul after testing positive before those games. Mike Moran, a
spokesman for the USOC, said that all disputed cases had been
investigated at the time and that all athletes in question had been
exonerated. The charge was outrageous, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Craig Masback, chief executive of the U.S. track and field
federation, met with Pound here on Tuesday to express his
displeasure with the way his federation had been portrayed as
behaving improperly in handling doping matters.
</P>
<P>
   In a telephone interview, Masback said USA Track and Field had
been the first sports federation in the world to conduct
out-of-competition testing and had conducted more tests for more
substances and caught more cheats than any other federation.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   He said that USA Track and Field was making an honest effort in
a system flawed in many ways: laboratories do not report results
for up to eight weeks and forward insufficient paperwork; tests are
sometimes improperly conducted; organizations do not conduct
follow-up investigations of suspicious tests for months or years;
the science of drug testing does not always withstand legal
scrutiny; the IOC-accredited laboratories rely on various Olympic
bodies for financing, and laboratory directors are reluctant to
testify against the shoddy work of other facilities for fear that
they will lose income from drug-testing referrals.
</P>
<P>
   If the Americans cannot be trusted, Masback said, then the
agency created by the International Olympic Committee or track and
field's world governing body should begin administering all drug
tests for the American federation. ``Let them see the frailties of
the system,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Masback said that the 12 to 15 tests under discussion had been
conducted at an IOC-accredited lab in Indianapolis. The laboratory
apparently was not simultaneously notifying the various sports
bodies _ the United States and International Olympic Committees and
the international and American track and field federations _ of
positive results, as is required, Masback said.
</P>
<P>
   Three or four athletes were exonerated because when their urine
samples were divided into halves for testing, one half of the
sample tested positive while the other tested negative. A failed
test is not declared unless both the so-called A and B samples test
positive.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   The remaining sticking point between USA Track and Field and the
international federation involves confidentiality. The U.S. system
states that an athlete will not be suspended, or his name forwarded
to the IAAF and made public, until after the A and B samples are
tested and a lengthy set of appeals is exhausted. Some appeals have
carried on for four years.
</P>
<P>
   This is too long, according to the IAAF, which suspends athletes
after the A sample is declared positive. The international
federation is also demanding to see test results involving U.S.
athletes who have been cleared by the U.S. federation so that
cover-ups can be detected if they occur.

   HIGH-SPEED ACCESS VENTURE
</P>
<P>
   Softbank Corp., one of the world's largest investors in
Internet-related businesses, is starting a third venture aimed at
increasing access to the Internet at high speeds. IP Revolution,
the new unit, plans to offer the service over fiber optic cables
sometime next year, according to an application filed with
regulators in Tokyo. Two other efforts by Softbank to provide
high-speed Internet services have faltered, in part because of
technical complications. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ACTION BY JAPAN REGULATORS
</P>
<P>
   Japanese financial regulators conducted a surprise inspection of
J.P. Morgan, which is to be bought by Chase Manhattan Corp. Morgan
officials said the Securities and Exchange Surveillance Commission,
Japan's securities industry watchdog, was examining records in
Morgan's Tokyo office. The regulators also punished West LB
Securities Pacific Ltd., a unit of Germany's largest state-owned
bank, by temporarily suspending some of its operations in Japan
after uncovering illegal transactions involving subordinated
loans. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   SHIP COMPANY HAS STRONG RESULTS
</P>
<P>
   The British shipping and cruise line Peninsular &AMP; Oriental Steam
Navigation Co. said half-year net income jumped 17 percent, to 151
million pounds, or about $213 million, on strong gains in its ports
unit and shipping joint venture. Sales rose 19 percent, to 1.98
billion pounds, or about $2.79 billion. Full-year profit for the
shipping joint venture, P&AMP;O Nedlloyd, will exceed analysts'
expectations, the company said.
</P>
<P>
   PROFIT FALLS AT IRISH AIRLINE
</P>
<P>
   The Irish national airline Aer Lingus PLC reported net profits
of 51.9 million euros in 1999, down 30 percent from 74.6 million
euros in 1998, despite a 12 percent increase in revenue to 1.134
billion euros. The company carried 6.5 million passengers in 1999,
an increase of 13 percent. The Irish government is expected to sell
the airline in a public offering early next year. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   VODAFONE BOARD MEMBER RESIGNS
</P>
<P>
   Klaus Esser, the former chairman of Mannesmann AG, resigned from
the board of the Vodafone Group, the world's largest mobile
telephone operator. Esser had joined the board on an interim basis
after Mannesmann was acquired by Vodafone for $183 billion in the
largest takeover ever. Esser was paid $27 million in severance
pay. &QL;

   NO SURPRISE INVITATIONS
</P>
<P>
   The Commission on Presidential Debates has formally invited Vice
President Al Gore and Gov. George W. Bush of Texas to participate
in the first of three planned debates, on Tuesday, Oct. 3, at the
University of Massachusetts in Boston.
</P>
<P>
   The bipartisan commission announced on Tuesday, Sept. 26, that
of the seven major and minor-party candidates whose names were on
ballots in enough states to ``have a theoretical chance of winning
a majority of the votes in the Electoral College,'' only Gore and
Bush met all of the panel's requirements. The central requirement
is that a candidate must have the support of an average of 15
percent in five national polls by news organizations.
</P>
<P>
   Two of the excluded candidates, Ralph Nader of the Green Party
and Patrick J. Buchanan of the Reform Party, have repeatedly
criticized the 15-percent threshold as virtually unobtainable for a
third-party contender.
</P>
<P>
   The commission also invited the major-party candidates for vice
president, Dick Cheney and Sen. Joseph Lieberman, to a debate on
Oct. 5 in Danville, Ky.
</P>
<P>
   BOOK AGENT TAKES PARTISAN ROLE
</P>
<P>
   Dick Cheney got a bit of a surprise when he found out whom Sen.
Joseph I. Lieberman has tapped as his surrogate Dick Cheney for
practice debates. It's Robert Barnett, the Washington-based lawyer
and book agent who represents Lynne Cheney, who is the wife of Dick
Cheney. ``He's Lynne's book agent!'' Dick Cheney said when he got
the news. To which Lynne Cheney joked, ``My former book agent _
until this minute he was my book agent.''
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Cheney, who has written a number of books, has the Secret
Service code name ``Author.'' For that matter, Lieberman also has
written several books. His agent: Robert Barnett. How does Dick
Cheney think Barnett will do portraying him? ``I'm sure he does
fine,'' Cheney said. ``He's a smart guy.''
</P>
<P>
   THE TRAVEL LOG
</P>
<P>
   George W. Bush continued trolling for votes and campaign cash
Way Out West on Tuesday, courting Californians with his message of
a recession in American education. Al Gore, meanwhile, worked swing
states throughout the Midwest, talking mainly about Medicare but
digressing while meeting with some Michigan twentysomethings to rap
about everything from medicinal marijuana to recycling. The stats:
</P>
<P>
   Length of the Official Day: Gore, 13 1/2 hours; Bush, 14 hours
</P>
<P>
   States Visited: Gore, 3; Bush, 1

   Microsoft Antitrust Case Is Sent to Appeals Court
</P>
<P>
   The Supreme Court handed a tactical victory to Microsoft when it
summarily rejected the government's plea to immediately hear the
appeal of its landmark antitrust case and instead returned the
proceeding to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of
Columbia. The decision gives Microsoft greater breathing room to
pursue its appeals, relieves the company of any pressure to return
any time soon to the bargaining table and, in the absence of a
settlement, could prolong a final court judgment by a year or
longer.

   Kodak Stock Plunges 25 Percent on Sudden Drop in Sales &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Eastman Kodak Co., citing a sudden and as-yet-unexplained sales
decline in every one of its businesses, warned investors that its
third-quarter earnings would be as much as 25 cents a share below
expectations and that, if sales do not pick up, fourth-quarter
earnings might disappoint as well. Kodak said third-quarter revenue
would probably fall short of expectations by $200 million to $300
million. Kodak stock plunged $14.81 a share Tuesday, or 25 percent,
to $44.19, the lowest level in more than six years.
</P>
<P>
   Stocks Slump on Kodak
</P>
<P>
   Warning Stocks fell sharply after an earning warnings from
Eastman Kodak worried investors. The Dow Jones industrial average
dropped 176.83 points, or 1.6 percent, to 10,631.32. The Nasdaq
composite index was down 52.12 points, or 1.4 percent, to 3,689.10,

0.8 percent, to 1,427.21.

   Insider Trading Curbs to be Eased
</P>
<P>
   A little-noticed Securities and Exchange Commission rule that
goes into effect next month should make it easier for corporate
insiders to sell their companies' stock without running afoul of
insider-trading law. While the new provision could theoretically
affect many of the estimated 16 million Americans who own shares in
the companies they work for, its biggest impact will be on senior
managers eager to unlock the wealth of their stock-and-options
riches without veering into legal trouble.

   Bayer Wants to Sell Hemophilia Drug Directly to Patients

<P>
   Unable to manufacture enough of a new drug for hemophiliacs,
Bayer Corp. has taken the unusual step of asking patients to apply

   3Com Loss Is Less Than Forecast
</P>
<P>
   3Com reported a smaller-than-expected first-quarter loss, citing
a reorganization that included its exit from the analog modem and
network router businesses in the previous quarter. Before 3Com
reported its results, its shares closed at $13.94, down 6 cents. In
after-hours trading, however, 3Com rose more than 15 percent,

OLYMPICS COVERAGE ON TV FAILS TO DRAW AS MANY VIEWERS AS EXPECTED 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By STEVE ROCK  
 c. 2000 Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   KANSAS CITY, Mo. _ For the last 12 years, Ron Barr has listened
to impassioned sports fans while sitting in front of his radio
microphone. He's the host of ``Sports Byline USA,'' a nationally
syndicated sports call-in show out of San Francisco that is
broadcast in Kansas City on KMBZ-AM.
</P>
<P>
   And he has no doubt what the general reaction has been to this
year's Olympics.
</P>
<P>
   ``Ho-hum,'' Barr said Tuesday by telephone from California.
``Nobody cares. It's terrible. There used to be an enthusiasm. But
now, the enthusiasm has been replaced by apathy.''
</P>
<P>
   Call it Olym-pathy.
</P>
<P>
   A convergence of factors _ the time difference (16 hours between
Kansas City and Australia), the September timing, the immediate
Olympic coverage available on the Internet _ have rained down on
network executives at NBC. The ensuing shower could wash out the TV
ratings, which so far are the worst in at least 20 years.
</P>
<P>
   Although more than 170 million people have watched at least some
of the Olympics in its first 11 days, viewership is lagging well
behind the slightly more than 16 million households that the
network conservatively promised advertisers.
</P>
<P>
   On the recent bright side, NBC's Day 11 Monday-night coverage
was the most-watched night to date with a 15.8 rating (each ratings
point equals about 1 million American households) and 68 million
people tuning in.
</P>
<P>
   Before this week's ratings uptick, this month's Olympic
telecasts had shown a 19 percent ratings drop from the 1992
Olympics in Barcelona, Spain, and a 32 percent drop from the '96
Games in Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
   So what's wrong? Start with the time difference.
</P>
<P>
   Many of the biggest events are taking place in the early-morning
hours in the United States, leaving NBC in a coverage predicament.
The network has chosen to broadcast nothing live. The problem is
that most fans already have found out what happened long before the
events are shown at night.
</P>
<P>
   The official Web site of the Games, www.olympics.com, generated
187 million hits for the Atlanta Games in 1996 and 634 million two
years later for the Winter Games in Nagano, Japan.
</P>
<P>
   As of Sunday, the site already had surpassed 6 billion hits.
People are not waiting for NBC's coverage.
</P>
<P>
   So why not live coverage? Who would watch at 4 a.m.? Too few
people, said Cameron Blanchard, director of NBC Sports
Communications, from Sydney.
</P>
<P>
   ``Research has shown that 9 percent of the viewing audience is
available in the wee hours of the morning _ 9 percent, n-i-n-e.
It's nothing,'' Blanchard said. ``This is business. We paid $705
million for the rights for Sydney. And we are not in the business
of putting on the Olympics when no one's available to watch.''
</P>
<P>
   Viewers in such northern American cities as Seattle, Detroit and
Buffalo, N.Y., have the option of watching the Canadian
Broadcasting Corp.'s live Olympics coverage. Blanchard, however,
says people are not getting out of bed to do that.
</P>
<P>
   A second key factor is that these Olympics are taking place in
September, rather than July or August. That's because they are
being held in the Southern Hemisphere _ in fact, the last time the
Games were in Australia, 1956 in Melbourne, they were held Nov. 22
to Dec. 8.
</P>
<P>
   If they were any earlier than September, it still would be
winter in Australia.
</P>
<P>
   ``Americans' lifestyles are different in September than in June
or July. People have less time for television,'' said Neal Pilson,
former president of CBS Sports who now runs the TV sports
consulting firm of Pilson Communications. ``There's school and work
and two-job families. It's just a less-relaxed lifestyle once we
get into September.''
</P>
<P>
   However, the 1988 Olympics in Seoul, South Korea, also were held
the last two weeks of September and had a double-digit time
difference from the United States. Yet ratings for them were 17
percent higher than current ratings for the Sydney Games.
</P>
<P>
   Still, Pilson said, ``I don't believe that the Olympics are in
any difficulty. They're getting huge numbers. They're just not as
huge as people expected.''
</P>
<P>
   U.S. Rep. Jim Ryun, a former Olympic runner, said there was
something of a hangover effect from the 1996 Olympics in Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
   ``Anything from there is going to be something of a letdown,''
the Kansan said. ``When you've hosted the Olympics, and everything
is instantaneous, that's a lot different than what we're
experiencing now. Not only that, but we're not the host.''
</P>
<P>
   Another theory is that having either the Summer or the Winter
Olympics now every two years _ rather than them being in the same
year, as they were until 1994 when the Winter Games were moved _
minimizes the effect. Still others say the acceptance of
professional athletes _ basketball and baseball players, for
example _ has robbed the Games of their amateur appeal.
</P>
<P>
   It didn't help that there was a shortage of feel-good U.S.
gymnastics stories emanating from Australia. The Americans didn't
win any gymnastics medals, and there was no Kerri Strug moment.
</P>
<P>
   ``The first week we didn't have the water-cooler story like we
did in Atlanta,'' NBC's Blanchard said.
</P>
<P>
   The result is that, in an Olympic year that should have Kansas
Citians celebrating the accomplishments of local gold medalists
Maurice Greene, Tara Nott and Christie Ambrosi, there's more talk
instead about the 2-2 Chiefs.
</P>
<P>
   ``We get a few people, but we're not getting too many who want
to watch (the Olympics),'' Brad Hunt, bartender at Connie's
Genessee Inn, said this week. ``Just not interested.''
</P>
<P>
   Brian McTavish and Malcolm Garcia contributed to this report.

HIGH-SPEED TRAINS GETTING OFF TO A SLOWER THAN EXPECTED START 
</HEADLINE>
  (Travel Column) 
 By JOE SHARKEY    
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Business travelers, still toting up the fiscal and psychological
costs of the summer's air-travel gridlock, are soon going to be
hearing a lot more about the future promise of ``high-speed rail.''
</P>
<P>
   High-speed rail conjures up images of blazing bullet trains in
Japan, or of the sleek 175-mile-an hour and faster trains that now
link cities in Europe on new rail-beds built for real speed. In
this country, Congress is currently weighing passage of a bill that
would enable money-hemorrhaging Amtrak to borrow $10 billion for
high-speed rail projects around the country.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, as the lobbying to pass the bill intensifies, Amtrak
is about to finally roll out its long-delayed $1.7 billion Acela
Express high-speed rail service between New York City and Boston,
which is seen as a prototype for domestic high-speed rail projects.
The new train, which will be promoted as a way for business
travelers to avoid the crowded skies, will reach speeds of 150
miles an hour on portions of its run.
</P>
<P>
   Joseph Vranich, a former Amtrak executive and a leading
proponent of developing new public-private compacts to replace
Amtrak and build a viable system of high-speed rail lines that will
strategically link to the nation's air-travel system, says not so
fast.
</P>
<P>
   He means literally not so fast, by the way. Vranich says that
the new Acela Express trains are not true world-class high-speed
trains and will be too slow to really compete with air shuttle
service. Furthermore, he says, the overall $10 billion high-speed
rail package being figuratively hauled by the new Acela Express is
really a pork-barrel bonanza that will spend money on unnecessary
projects and leave the United States lagging behind Europe and
Japan in having an effective high-speed rail system.
</P>
<P>
   ``Originally, Amtrak said the Acela Express was supposed to
travel between New York and Boston in 2 hours and 55 minutes, with
further improvements in time,'' said Vranich, who was a member of
the congressionally appointed Amtrak Reform Council before he
resigned in July, claiming that Amtrak was a money-pit and that the
only effective reform would be to discard it.
</P>
<P>
   ``The schedule keeps getting longer,'' Vranich said of the Acela
Express. ``The last thing I heard, it was going to be 3 hours and
15 minutes.''
</P>
<P>
   Actually, the new Acela is going to take as long as 3 hours and
20 minutes to travel between New York and Boston, said Rick
Remington, an Amtrak spokesman.
</P>
<P>
   ``Well, that's not competitive,'' Vranich argued. ``To be
air-competitive on that route, you really have to come in at under
three hours. The bottom line is that when the Acela express is up
and running full blast, I regret to say not enough airline
passengers will be diverted to rail.''
</P>
<P>
   Amtrak's Remington replied, ``Joe Vranich had the opportunity to
make that argument with the Amtrak Reform Council, but chose to
quit. Thirty-six states from Maine to California, on the other
hand, are now working with Amtrak to expand service or invest in
high-speed rail projects. The traveling public is responding with
the highest ridership in Amtrak's 29-year history.''
</P>
<P>
   Vranich, who is the author of the book ``Super-Trains: Solutions
to America's Transportation Gridlock'' (St. Martin's Press, 1991),
said that he isn't opposed to the Aleca Express per se.
</P>
<P>
   ``What I'm saying is Amtrak is going to be 30 years old next
year. After 30 years and billions of dollars _ bottom line _ here
is what we have in terms of a modern high-speed train: The Acela
Express in the year 2000 will travel between New York and Boston
only 40 minutes faster than the 1956 schedule between New York and
Boston of the Advance Merchants Limited, a train run by the old New
Haven Railroad.''
</P>
<P>
   Remington said that the first Acela Express trains are expected
to be delivered by the end of this week. After a crew shakedown
period, he said, the trains should be carrying the first passengers
within a few weeks. ``But until we've got a train on our hands,
we're not setting a date'' for the start of service, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Vranich argued that, whatever the merits of the much-heralded
Acela Express, a politically beholden bureaucracy like Amtrak is
incapable of planning and delivering a national network of ``true
high-technology, high-speed trains that tie in with the aviation
system'' in strategic, high-traffic areas of the Northeast, Midwest
and coastal California.
</P>
<P>
   The problem, he asserted, is that ``politicians all over the
country are standing up to say what a wonderful thing this $10
billion high-speed rail spending bill is, because some of the money
is going to be spent in their districts.'' He said the bill and
other high-speed initiatives have defined ``high speed rail'' in
such a way that much of the funding will go to slower trains and
what he believes is unnecessary long-distance rail service.
</P>
<P>
   Mr. Vranich said true high-speed rail, requiring a new
public-private financed infrastructure and even the building of new
tracks like the ones laid down in Europe to handle trains traveling
at 200 miles an hour, was the smart way to plan to alleviate
air-traffic strain that will only get worse in coming years, he
insisted.
</P>
<P>
   ``If all these other countries can set up viable high-speed rail
systems, why can't we?'' Mr. Vranich said. &QL;

EXCERPTS FROM SENATE HEARING ON WEN HO LEE CASE 
</HEADLINE>
   (Eds: see related CONGRESS-LEE)  
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Following are excerpts from the testimony of Attorney General
Janet Reno and Louis J. Freeh, the director of the Federal Bureau
of Investigation, before a joint hearing of the the Senate
Judiciary Committee and the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence
on Tuesday on the case of Wen Ho Lee, as recorded by The New York
Times:
</P>
<P>
   JANET RENO
</P>
<P>
   Director Freeh and I appreciate the opportunity to appear before
you today to tell you what we did in the case of Dr. Wen Ho Lee and
why we did it.
</P>
<P>
   At the outset, I must caution that we're limited in what we can
discuss here. The government has secured a commitment from Dr. Lee
to cooperate and to submit to a comprehensive debriefing in the
next few weeks and further inquiries for some months after that. We
do not, and I am sure you do not, want to do or say anything here
that would interfere with the debriefing. Some issues may also
require that we go into closed session ...
</P>
<P>
   As attorney general and as director of the FBI, Director Freeh
and I share together an awesome responsibility to protect the
national security of this nation, but at the same time to protect
the Constitution and the rights of all Americans. These cases are
difficult without full access to the facts, and given some of the
rumors and speculations that have been reported in the press, I can
understand that questions arise. But I hope that by the end of our
session today you will agree that our actions made sense, were
reasonable and were correct.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Lee is no hero. He is not an absent-minded professor. He is
a felon. He committed a very serious, calculated crime, and he pled
guilty to it. He abused the trust of the American people by putting
at risk some of our core national security secrets. He had one of
the highest security clearance levels possible, granting him access
to the most sensitive of nuclear weapons information. He had worked
at Los Alamos National Laboratory for 20 years. He had access to
the Los Alamos computer system that was designed precisely to be
secure against unauthorized intrusions.
</P>
<P>
   What was on that secure system? Nuclear weapon design and
testing data that is in effect the library of blueprints of most of
the United States nuclear weapons designs, designs that are the
fruit of the investment of hundreds of billions of dollars. Dr. Lee
systematically, deliberately moved nuclear weapons data that was
not even related to the work he was doing. He moved it from the
system where it was safe and secure to a vulnerable computer in the
Los Alamos system that any hacker or foreign government could
penetrate. Dr. Lee did so by betraying the trust that had been
placed in him to protect those secrets.
</P>
<P>
   The process of transferring this data took Dr. Lee a long time,
nearly 40 hours over a 70-day period. As has been pointed out, it
involved the equivalent of 400,000 pages. Stacked up, that's a
13-story building. He left this information that is so vital to our
national security on that unsecure computer, not for hours or days
or even months. He left it there for years. He knew that it was
classified. He knew that what he was doing was wrong. He moved
files in such a way as to defeat security measures he knew were in
place. He went further. He copied the information from the unsecure
computer onto 10 portable tapes. Three were recovered by the FBI,
seven are missing. What's more, he made copies of the portable
tapes and those copies are also missing. When Dr. Lee found out he
was being investigated, he took steps to cover up his actions.
After his access was revoked to the part of the lab where the
secure computer resided, he tried over and over again to get in,
including at 3:30 a.m. on one Christmas Eve.
</P>
<P>
   Despite what you read in the papers, until he entered the plea
agreement Dr. Lee never had said he would admit his wrongdoing,
plead guilty to a felony and tell us what he did with the tape. The
plea agreement entered into by the government with Dr. Lee is our
best chance to find out what happened to the computer tapes
containing some of the nation's most important nuclear designs and
testing information.
</P>
<P>
   LOUIS FREEH
</P>
<P>
   As an expert from Los Alamos testified in this case, the
material downloaded and copied represented the complete nuclear
weapons design capability of Los Alamos at that time _ 50 years of
nuclear weapons development at the expense of hundreds of billions
of dollars.
</P>
<P>
   Quoting from Dr. Younger: These codes and their associated
databases and the input file combined with someone that knew how to
use them could, in my opinion, in the wrong hands, change the
global strategic balance. They enable the possessor to design the
only objects that could result in the military defeat of America's
conventional forces. The only threat, for example, to our carrier
battle groups. They represent the gravest possible security risk to
the United States.
</P>
<P>
   Before he created the tapes, only two sites in the world held
this complete design portfolio: Division X at Los Alamos and
another national laboratory.
</P>
<P>
   Now, many have asked if his conduct was so bad, why did the
government negotiate a plea agreement and agree to release him.
Fair question. Understandable.  &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   (MORE) &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &QL; 
nn
</P>
<P>
   But it has a very simple answer: Department of Justice and the
FBI concluded that this guilty plea, coupled with his agreement to
submit to questioning under oath and to a polygraph, was our best
opportunity to protect the national security by finding out what
happened to the seven missing tapes. And we found out, on the way
to the courthouse, the additional copies of tapes which he has now
admitted to having made.
</P>
<P>
   This was always the object of this investigation and
prosecution: Why did he make them? Where are they? What happened to
them? And who had access to them?
</P>
<P>
   From the moment we learned last year that our nation's nuclear
secrets were on missing portable tapes, we have had this central
goal: to find out what happened to them. This was the goal of the
entire national security leadership of our government, not just the
FBI and the Department of Justice.
</P>
<P>
   Before any charges were brought against Dr. Lee, this matter was
analyzed by the highest levels of our government. Working together
we carefully considered the substantial risks to our national
security of proceeding with the public prosecution counterbalanced
against the risks of forgoing the prosecution.
</P>
<P>
   In the end there was a consensus that a criminal prosecution of
Dr. Lee presented the best opportunity for discovering where the
tapes were, why he made them and who, if anyone else, had access to
them.
</P>
<P>
   The decision to prosecute Dr. Lee was made only after repeated
attempts to gain his cooperation before indictment...
</P>
<P>
   I would now like to address the disturbing allegations that the
government engaged in selective prosecution or racial profiling in
its investigation and prosecution of Dr. Lee.
</P>
<P>
   There is simply no truth to these allegations. Dr. Lee was not
investigated nor indicted nor incarcerated because he is an
American of Asian decent.
</P>
<P>
   As the attorney general and the director of the FBI, we are
honored to head organizations that pride themselves with fair and
impartial law enforcement. We would never tolerate racial profiling
or selective prosecution.

FOR WAR-WEARY ANGOLA, ANIMALS OFFER A PEACEABLE KINGDOM 
</HEADLINE>
   By RACHEL L. SWARNS   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   LUANDA, Angola _ First came the elephants, with ears flapping
and trunks swinging. Then came the antelope, skittish and shy,
dancing on slender hooves.
</P>
<P>
   About 200 people _ cabinet ministers, military officers,
businessmen and journalists _ dropped by last week to welcome the
33 animals that were flown from South Africa earlier this month to
inhabit Quicama National Park, Angola's first wildlife reserve.
</P>
<P>
   ``We want, with this eloquent gesture, to demonstrate our
solidarity with nature and to bring beauty back to one of the most
important parks in the country,'' Fatima Jardim, the minister of
fisheries and environment, said at last week's ceremony.
</P>
<P>
   The announcement inevitably left some people dubious. Animal
rights activists in South Africa howled about the potential dangers
of poachers and land mines. Some Western diplomats worried that the
animals would be eaten by hungry Angolans. (Angola, which suffers
from severe shortages of food, understandably runs short of
optimism on most days.) Still, the story was big news in this
war-ravaged country, where people long for distractions from the
grinding hardships of daily living.
</P>
<P>
   Radio soap operas draw huge audiences here and entire
communities turn out each year to elect local beauty queens. On the
day that the crowd gathered to watch the antelope, for instance,
hundreds lined up to see 16 young women in tiny bikinis and
sparkling high heels compete for the title of Luanda.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a way for us to see that Angola isn't just about war,''
said Amelia Veloso, 25, who sat in the audience. ``It's a way for
us to feel like we have culture and we're part of the world.''
</P>
<P>
   Older people still proudly remember the days when thousands of
elephants, buffalo and antelope wandered through the 3-million acre
reserve, which was established in 1938 and sits just 43 miles
outside Luanda, the capital.
</P>
<P>
   They remember too how the animals were killed and stolen after
the civil war began in 1975 by soldiers, hunters and the hungry.
Today the vast expanse of grasslands and thickets are almost bereft
of large animals.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everything had been shot and poached and killed,'' said Wouter
van Houven, the president of the Kissama Foundation, the nonprofit
group that manages the park.
</P>
<P>
   The foundation built a fence and hired guards to protect the 15
elephants, 10 kudu and 8 eland. They were donated by South Africa,
which has a surplus of the animals. As the animals were flown in on
several flights, van Houven found himself defending the project.
</P>
<P>
   No, there aren't any land mines in the park, he insisted. No,
there aren't rebels fighting nearby. And no, the government is not
wasting public money. The foundation, he said, relies entirely on
private donations.
</P>
<P>
   There was one fatality, however. One elephant stumbled as the
cargo plane was landing, fell on her sternum and suffocated.
Undeterred, foundation officials say they still plan to import 300
elephants from Botswana next year.
</P>
<P>
   Someday, they hope, foreign tourists will fill luxury lodges on
the banks of the nearby Cuanza River. This month, however, the
crowd was made up of Angolans eager for a bit of good news.
</P>
<P>
   ``The day that we offloaded those elephants, some people stood
there crying,'' said van Houven, who is also a professor of
wildlife management at the University of Pretoria in South Africa.
``The rest stood with their mouths open with awe because they've
never seen a live elephant.''

NBC ENDS BID FOR BASEBALL, SO FOX LANDS SIX-YEAR CONTRACT 
</HEADLINE>
   By RICHARD SANDOMIR   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NBC and baseball are parting ways.
</P>
<P>
   The network told officials of Major League Baseball on Tuesday
that it would not agree to pay at least double its current $80
million-a-year rights fee, ceding all the broadcast rights to Fox.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have informed Major League Baseball that we have passed on
their offer,'' said Ken Schanzer, the president of NBC Sports.
</P>
<P>
   NBC will end its association with baseball with the American
League Championship Series next month.
</P>
<P>
   A news conference to announce the Fox deal is expected
Wednesday, television executives said. They also said that ESPN
rejected a demand to renew its division series rights, which will
be part of the Fox contract. ESPN was being asked to more than
double its fee of about $6 million a game for about six division
series broadcasts.
</P>
<P>
   Fox has made a six-year, $2.5 billion offer to own all the
national broadcast rights and retain its Fox Sports Net and Fx
cable rights. For the last five years, it has paid $575 million to
carry the Saturday Game of the Week, alternated All-Star Games and
World Series with NBC, showed one league championship series while
NBC showed the other, and televised divisional series games.
</P>
<P>
   Fox will now take NBC's All-Star Game and postseason rights plus
ESPN's divisional series rights.
</P>
<P>
   Divisional series games have never thrilled the networks,
because their ratings are low.
</P>
<P>
   Baseball had originally sought a tripling of Fox's payments to
retain what it had, largely to mimic ESPN's new six-year,
regular-season $810 million contract.
</P>
<P>
   By making its new deal, Fox is guaranteeing highly rated World
Series every year for six years _ although the event's rating are
in a downward trend _ along with lower-rated League Championship
Series games.
</P>
<P>
   The added games will fill Fox's October programming schedule but
will also force it to sell considerably more commercial inventory.
And as the network with the weakest ratings, Fox will be faced with
stiff counterprogramming from its three major rivals; when NBC was
splitting the rights, it did not diminish the value of baseball by
putting its best shows against the World Series.
</P>
<P>
   For NBC, this is its second leave-taking from baseball in the
past 10 years. CBS paid $1.06 billion for all the broadcast rights
commencing from 1990 to 1993. The deal lost an estimated $500
million for the network.
</P>
<P>
   NBC returned in 1994 in a revenue-sharing partnership called the
Baseball Network with ABC and Major League Baseball. It provided
baseball with no cash up front, and the partnership then unraveled
because the players' strike eliminated revenues from the 1994
postseason.
</P>
<P>
   NBC and ABC left acrimoniously, charging that baseball had dealt
unfairly with them.
</P>
<P>
   NBC vowed not to make a deal with baseball again until the 21st
century. But four months after the divorce, NBC made the five-year,
$400 million deal that will conclude with its ALCS telecasts. &QL;

LIEBERMAN PORTRAYS GOP CANDIDATES AS DECEPTIVE 
</HEADLINE>
  By RICHARD PEREZ-PENA   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   In his toughest attack yet in this campaign, Sen. Joseph
Lieberman on Connecticut on Tuesday portrayed the platform of Gov.
George W. Bush and Dick Cheney as a wide-ranging deception, saying
that their promises contradicted their records.
</P>
<P>
   ``Over the last several weeks, there has been a troubling
pattern emerging in this election,'' Lieberman said in an address
to a bricklayers' union convention in Atlantic City, N.J. ``On
issue after issue, our opponents tell us one thing, but their
records and the details of their plans tell us something very
different.''
</P>
<P>
   His remarks signaled an intensified offensive against Bush, and
echoed the Republicans' main line of attack, the charge of
inconsistency and hypocrisy. The Democrats are bent on painting
Bush as a staunch conservative who poses as a moderate with empty
promises on education and health care.
</P>
<P>
   Lieberman, the Democratic vice-presidential nominee, challenged
Bush's recent claims that public education has stagnated under the
Clinton administration, calling the claims unfair to schools that
are improving. And while he gave a long list of education projects
Gore would invest in, he said the Republicans would have no money
to spend on schools after their tax cuts.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'll tell you what the real education gap is in America this
year,'' he said. ``It's the gap in the Bush-Cheney campaign between
what they're talking about and what their plan will actually do.
When it comes to education, I promise you Al Gore and I have not
only the will to improve education in our country, but the wallet _
or the money left in the wallet _ to make it happen.''
</P>
<P>
   Dan Bartlett, a spokesman for the Bush campaign, said: ``Senator
Lieberman would be better served explaining why America's in the
midst of an education recession in the Clinton-Gore years. We've
seen test scores stagnate, and the achievement gap between minority
students and their peers remains wide.''
</P>
<P>
   For the first time, Lieberman directly criticized the record of
Cheney, a former secretary of defense and congressman, charging
that his record directly contradicted the Republicans' recent
claims that they would ``leave no child behind.''
</P>
<P>
   ``When he was in Congress in the 1980s, he voted against Head
Start funding five times, against measures important to the school
lunch program six times,'' Lieberman said of Cheney. ``He was one
of only 33 members of the House of Representatives to vote against
a plan to provide a lump-sum benefit to widows and children of
federal law enforcement officers and firefighters killed in the
line of duty.''
</P>
<P>
   He also noted that under Bush, Texas ranks near the bottom among
all states in the percentage of its children with health insurance.

MISSOURI MAN'S LOVE STORY ENDS IN MURDER, SUICIDE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MARK MORRIS  
 c. 2000 Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   KANSAS CITY, Mo. _ Jerry Cassaday sat in his recliner and looked
out on the lake behind his apartment in Odessa. Nearby were
reminders of his life: a photo of his three boys, a photo of his
ex-wife and a photo of his girlfriend.
</P>
<P>
   Not far away was his .22-caliber rifle.
</P>
<P>
   It had all gone so wrong, and he had been such a fool.
</P>
<P>
   Cassaday, an ex-cop, had murdered a man in Michigan for the
woman he loved. Now he believed she had lied to him.
</P>
<P>
   On a February day this year, Cassaday decided he would not go to
prison. Ex-cops can't go to prison.
</P>
<P>
   But Jerry Cassaday wouldn't take secrets to the grave.
</P>
<P>
   A locked briefcase under his bed would see to that.
</P>
<P>
   Within a month Cassaday's girlfriend sat in a Flint, Mich.,
jail, charged with conspiring with Cassaday to kill her husband.
She has pleaded not guilty. Authorities, her attorney said, bungled
their investigation and built their case on fabricated evidence.
</P>
<P>
   The evidence in that briefcase, now laid out in Michigan court
files, tells a story of love, deception and murder.
</P>
<P>
   Jerry Cassaday's life had been so different. His family
described him as a high-spirited guy with a great sense of humor.
</P>
<P>
   For nine years he was a Cass County sheriff's deputy who was
proud of his work chasing thieves, robbers and even killers.
Eventually he became a lieutenant. In his spare time he took his
sons hunting.
</P>
<P>
   But problems in the department prompted his resignation in 1994.
Later he separated from his wife. Drug and alcohol problems dogged
him, too.
</P>
<P>
   He joined the security detail at Harrah's North Kansas City
Casino &AMP; Hotel, and that led to a job in Reno, Nev. He dealt cards
there at Harrah's Casino. But Cassaday still had problems making
payments on his late-model Ford F-150 pickup.
</P>
<P>
   Then one day last year, a woman walked into the casino.
</P>
<P>
   She was Sharee Miller, who at 27 was more than 10 years younger
than Cassaday. She was an attractive, supportive and seemingly
wealthy woman from Flint. She stayed in the plusher hotel suites,
and Cassaday heard stories about her money, jewelry and businesses.
</P>
<P>
   Workers at Harrah's first saw Jerry and Sharee together in the
early summer of 1999, when she was in town for a Mary Kay Cosmetics
convention.
</P>
<P>
   One of the employees, Carol Slaughter, told a Michigan detective
that the couple had big plans.
</P>
<P>
   ``Jerry told me...they had gone out and they had looked at
homes...in the half-million-dollar (range),'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   At the time Miller was just married. In April 1999 she had
married Bruce Miller, a General Motors Corp. autoworker who ran an
auto salvage yard on the side.
</P>
<P>
   Sharee opened the business in the mornings while Bruce slept,
and then he took over in the afternoon before he started the third
shift. She also cared for three children from a previous marriage.
</P>
<P>
   Cassaday heard about Bruce Miller's other side. Cassaday came to
believe Sharee's husband was an organized crime figure with a hand
in drugs and money laundering. And he believed that Sharee would be
killed if she tried to leave her husband.
</P>
<P>
   Between her visits to Reno, Miller and Cassaday kept in touch
through the Internet. They sent each other hundreds of e-mails and
spent hours corresponding in private chat rooms, court records
state.
</P>
<P>
   ``Your fool for life, Jerry,'' Cassaday would sign off.
</P>
<P>
   ``Love your brat, Sharee,'' she'd answer.
</P>
<P>
   It wasn't always so lighthearted. In a Sept. 23, 1999, chat
session, Cassaday learned about Sharee's recent pregnancy. Cassaday
certainly was the father, and he pressed for details.
</P>
<P>
   ``This next part will be hard....I lost my baby, Jerry.''
</P>
<P>
   ``No,'' Cassaday responded.
</P>
<P>
   As he watched the screen, more secrets about Sharee's husband
tumbled out.
</P>
<P>
   ``I never thought I would ever tell you that he hits. I got in
trouble because I was with you.''
</P>
<P>
   Cassaday demanded more details.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sharee, you can tell me now, or in person when I beat it out
of him,'' he wrote.
</P>
<P>
   Cassaday believed from the message that Sharee's injuries were
so bad she had to go to the hospital, but she told the doctors she
had fallen.
</P>
<P>
   ``It made me start having bad thoughts of killing him.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Where did he hit you?'' Cassaday demanded.
</P>
<P>
   ``...Jerry, I can't tell you.''
</P>
<P>
   Cassaday pushed for more.
</P>
<P>
   ``He didn't hit me, Jerry; he raped me....I lost the baby
because of the force.''
</P>
<P>
   The next day Cassaday wrote: ``The things you told me ripped me
in half.... No one, I mean no one, is going to get away with the
things he has done to you.''
</P>
<P>
   The mood lightened the next month with news that Miller was
pregnant again, this time with twins.
</P>
<P>
   ``Baby, it's all gonna be fine soon,'' Cassaday tapped out on
his computer. ``We will live a wonderful happy life together.''
</P>
<P>
   Soon, after Cassaday had moved back to Missouri, he received
electronic pictures of the sonograms.
</P>
<P>
   ``I love the e-mails you sent me about the baby,'' Cassaday
wrote. ``Please don't stop sending me this stuff....I love you so
much honey.''

LAWMAKERS BAR PAYMENT FOR NUCLEAR WEAPONS WORKERS 
</HEADLINE>
   By MATTHEW L. WALD    
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ House and Senate negotiators have dropped a
provision in the military authorization bill that would have
provided compensation for nuclear weapons workers made sick or
killed by exposure to radiation or toxic chemicals, making its
enactment this year very uncertain.
</P>
<P>
   The Clinton administration had been pushing for a plan, which
was approved by the Senate, that would set up a program similar to
workers compensation and would provide reimbursement of lost wages
or $200,000, whichever is greater, plus medical expenses. But the
administration did not say where the money would come from. The
House Judiciary Committee favored a plan that offered $100,000 plus
health care costs.
</P>
<P>
   John P. Feehery, a spokesman for Speaker Dennis Hastert (R-Ill.)
said that the House's last position had been to provide $250
million to start the compensation process, but that the Senate
wanted more. ``They were pushing for an entitlement program, and
who knows what the final cost would have been, the multiple
billions, probably,'' Feehery said.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. David Michaels, the assistant secretary for environment and
health of the Energy Department, said that such estimates were
``outrageous exaggerations.'' The Congressional Budget Office
projects a cost of just under $1 billion in the first five years,
and cases are emerging at a rate of 50 to 100 a year, Dr. Michaels
said.
</P>
<P>
   He said that the payments would have to be made under an
entitlement program, just as workers compensation payments are
made. ``You can't start paying in one year and stop the next year
because you run out of money,'' he said. The administration is
still trying to get a compensation provision into the bill.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Ted Strickland, D-Ohio, whose district includes a uranium
processing plant, said, ``it is almost incomprehensible that people
could be so hard-hearted and heartless.''
</P>
<P>
   The Clinton Administration said early this year, for the first
time, that nuclear weapons manufacturing had caused illness and
premature death in some of the 600,000 people employed for it.

COMPANIES ACT TO KEEP BIOENGINEERED CORN OUT OF FOOD 
</HEADLINE>
  By BARNABY J. FEDER   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Moving to address safety concerns, agribusiness companies took
steps on Wednesday to limit the chances that a strain of
bioengineered corn unapproved for human consumption could end up in
food products.
</P>
<P>
   The corn, approved only for use in animal feed, was found last
week in a sampling of taco shells sold in stores under the Taco
Bell brand, prompting Kraft Foods to recall the more than 2.5
million boxes of the product believed to be in distribution.
</P>
<P>
   Aventis CropScience, which engineered the corn to make a
pesticide and marketed the technology under the StarLink name, told
seed companies on Wednesday not to sell any of the corn for
planting next year.
</P>
<P>
   Affirming a policy adopted Monday by the Biotechnology Industry
Organization, a Washington-based trade group, Aventis also said it
would no longer market bioengineered products for any use until
they had been cleared for use in food.
</P>
<P>
   ``We agree that it's prudent,'' said David Witherspoon,
president of Garst Seed Co., Aventis' biggest licensee. Witherspoon
said Garst, based in Slater, Iowa, would store StarLink corn seed
harvested this year on the assumption that StarLink would
eventually be cleared for food use.
</P>
<P>
   While it has not been established that the StarLink corn poses a
risk to human health, tests have found it to carry a protein that
has some characteristics of allergens.
</P>
<P>
   Witherspoon said Garst would direct farmers who want next year's
crops engineered to fend off the corn borer, a common pest, to use
corn strains based on Monsanto's YieldGuard technology, which has
government clearance for food uses.
</P>
<P>
   Aventis said on Wednesday that the company and regulators were
discussing the fate of the 315,000 acres planted with StarLink this
year. Aventis said it was close to announcing new measures
developed in consultation with farmers to confine the current crop
to approved uses. Aventis said that containing this year's crop
should not be a major challenge since it represented well under one
half of one percent of the 73 million acres planted in corn this
year.
</P>
<P>
   As Aventis moved to halt sales of the corn seed, the company
that milled the corn in the taco shells moved on Wednesday to halt
further shipments of yellow corn products from its mill in
Plainview, Texas The company, Azteca Mills of Dallas, said it was
testing for evidence of the unapproved corn and expected to resume
full production within a week. The Plainview mill had been
identified as the source of the corn meal for the Kraft taco
shells, which were made at a Pepsico-owned plant in Mexico.
</P>
<P>
   Kraft said on Wednesday that as far as it could determine all
Taco Bell shells were off the shelves. ``We will not destroy the
products that are being returned until we hear from the Food and
Drug Administration what it wants to do with them,'' said Michael
Mudd, a company spokesman.
</P>
<P>
   The recall will cost Kraft millions of dollars at a minimum but
the final figure, including lost sales, will not be known until
Kraft finds a new mill to make the shells and gets production
going, Mudd said. In any event, the losses are not expected to have
a material impact on the earnings of Philip Morris, Kraft's giant
parent.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile the Taco Bell restaurant chain said that tests had
turned up ``no reason to believe'' that the unapproved corn had
turned up in the shells used in its restaurants. Taco Bell's
suppliers include the Pepsico plant in Mexico, although its shells
use a different recipe than Kraft's.
</P>
<P>
   The restaurant chain, a subsidiary of Tricon Global Restaurants
in Louisville, Ky., said all shells now being shipped had been made
from corn grown in regions other than the Plainview area as an
added precaution.
</P>
<P>
   Biotechnology critics said that even with the corporate steps
being taken to deal with the episode, a thorough government
investigation was still in order.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can't identify a solution until you have a better
understanding of the problem,'` said Margaret Mellon, senior
scientist at the Union of Concerned Scientists in Washington.
</P>
<P>
   The StarLink corn is a latecomer among the several
first-generation biotechnology products that use genes from the
Bacillus thurengienses, or Bt family of bacteria, to produce a
protein deadly to corn borers. It was approved for use in corn for
animal feed or industrial products in 1998.

FORD MEMO IN 1990 RESTRICTED TIRE SUPPLIERS' ROLLOVER TESTS 
</HEADLINE>
  By KEITH BRADSHER    
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   DETROIT _ The Ford Motor Co. told its tire suppliers a decade
ago not to conduct without Ford's approval a driving test of the
rollover tendencies of sport utility vehicles and other light
trucks, an internal Ford document shows.
</P>
<P>
   The document is of interest because most of the 101 deaths
blamed on Firestone tires in complaints to regulators have occurred
in Ford Explorer sport utility vehicles that flipped over when a
tire failed. But there is considerable disagreement between Ford
and its critics over how the document should be interpreted.
</P>
<P>
   Steven M. Pavsner, a personal injury lawyer in Greenbelt, Md.,
who obtained the document in litigation, contended that it showed
that Ford was trying to limit research into rollovers. ``They don't
want a written trail,'' he said, adding that he planned to
distribute copies of the document to lawyers suing Ford in Explorer
cases.
</P>
<P>
   But Donald F. Tandy, a former Ford engineer who wrote the
document, said that the company was conducting driving tests at the
time as part of the development of a computer model of rollovers.
Ford and its tire suppliers were using the computer model, and Ford
had made a decision that it would conduct at its test track in
Arizona all of the real-world tests needed to establish that the
computer model fairly represented reality, Tandy said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We said we were in charge of validating the model,'' said
Tandy, who worked for Ford as a ``vehicle dynamics'' engineer until
1995, when he joined an engineering consulting firm in Houston that
does a lot of work for Ford and other automakers. Tandy discussed
the document at Ford's request.
</P>
<P>
   The document, dated Sept. 6, 1990, also says that Ford
instructed tire makers to provide its officials with oral, not
written, summaries of the results of computer simulations. The
statement is likely to interest congressional investigators, who
have been upset that Ford has not produced the results from
Explorer tire tests conducted in 1989.
</P>
<P>
   Clarence Ditlow, the executive director of the Center for Auto
Safety, a Washington-based advocacy group that works closely with
personal-injury lawyers, said that the reference to oral summaries
showed that Ford was trying to conceal information. ``It's showing
that you need to hide the results of the test,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Tandy denied this. Engineers for tire makers were just learning
to use the computer model then and were producing sometimes wildly
different results from day to day and then writing elaborate
reports based on inaccurate data, he said. Ford had asked the tire
makers' officials to discuss their results first because this was
simpler and because it did not want to spend years explaining every
test result in litigation, which has happened anyway, Tandy said.
</P>
<P>
   ``The summary reports would be inaccurate because they'd do
something wrong,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Susan Krusel, a Ford spokeswoman, said that Ford was still
looking for the tire test results requested by Congress and
believed that the results would confirm an affidavit by a Ford
engineer last week that all of the tests were done properly and did
not show a problem. ``We have a vested interest in finding this
document because it confirms'' the affidavit, she said.
</P>
<P>
   Pavsner said that he planned to distribute copies to other
lawyers in the hope that it could be used against the automaker in
the many cases involving Ford Explorer sport utility vehicles that
rolled over after Firestone tires failed.
</P>
<P>
   Pavsner obtained the document when he sued Ford unsuccessfully
this summer in the case of a Ford Aerostar van that rolled over
when it was hit by a larger van.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to Tandy, the document was also initialed by James
Avouris, another Ford engineer who produced the affidavit last week
that the Explorer had been tested.
</P>
<P>
   John Lampe, the executive vice president of
Bridgestone/Firestone Inc., a unit of the Bridgestone Corp. of
Japan, complained in congressional testimony last week that the
tire maker had not understood how the stability of sport utility
vehicles differed from cars, and had missed the significance of
tire failures on Explorers as a result. Federal data shows that
most tire-related deaths in Explorers and other sport utility
vehicles occur because of rollovers.
</P>
<P>
   The directive that barred driving tests of rollovers by tire
suppliers was quite explicit. ``No testing by a tire supplier in
the near or limit condition for J-turn is to be conducted w.o. Ford
supervisory approval as well as having Ford personnel at the
site,'' it said, using a common abbreviation for the word
``without.'' In a J-turn test, the vehicle is driven at fairly high
speed, typically 55 miles per hour, and then turned sharply,
inscribing the letter ``J,'' as viewed from above.
</P>
<P>
   The test is one of the less stringent for vehicles' tendency to
roll over. Independent experts, including federal regulators, have
begun using a so-called ``fish-hook'' turn, in which a driver does
a J-turn and then turns back suddenly in the opposite direction
from the semi-circle. The fish-hook turn simulates what might
happen if a driver exits a highway on a curved ramp and comes
around the ramp at fairly high speed only to swerve to avoid
backed-up traffic.

EDITORIAL: PERU'S SPY CHIEF IN EXILE 
</HEADLINE>
   c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The New York Times said in an editorial on Tuesday, Sept. 26:
</P>
<P>
   Vladimiro Montesinos, Peru's Rasputin, is now in Panama City
awaiting a decision on whether he will get political asylum there.
Montesinos, the intelligence chief and all-around fixer for Peru's
president, Alberto Fujimori, fled the country after a videotape was
televised that showed him apparently bribing a congressman. His
departure on Sunday from Peru was, perhaps, the only way to break
his hold on power there. But Montesinos must ultimately be brought
to justice. He is accused of serious human rights abuses, and
granting him asylum would be an insult to genuine victims.
</P>
<P>
   Panama should hold him with the goal of returning him to Peru
for trial when that becomes possible. If that date seems too far
away, then Panama should open an investigation to prosecute him for
torture _ which any nation may do.
</P>
<P>
   Montesinos, who ran the intelligence police, was so powerful
that many Peruvians believed the president worked for him. He has
been credibly accused of crimes ranging from running death squads
to election fraud, and the United States finally acknowledged that
he has had a long relationship with American intelligence services.
</P>
<P>
   The tape of Montesinos apparently bribing a legislator to switch
parties surfaced two weeks ago, and Fujimori promptly announced he
would hold new elections and not be a candidate, and that he had
dissolved the intelligence police. Montesinos dropped out of sight,
and there were rumors that his military allies were exploring the
possibility of a coup. On Sunday he flew to Panama.
</P>
<P>
   Panama has long been a haven for unwanted despots. But it did
not want Montesinos, initially refusing to take him when Peru
asked. But after pressure from Washington, the Organization of
American States and several of Peru's neighbors, Panama agreed to
let him in on a tourist visa while it considers his request for
asylum..
</P>
<P>
   The best course would have been for Peru to arrest Montesinos.
But his exile will at least allow Peruvians to begin to erase some
of his malevolent influence on their government. But Washington
should stop pressing to get him asylum. The only guarantee that
Montesinos should receive from Panama is that he will face justice,
either in Panama on charges of torture, or in Peru once it has
elected a government that can try him.  &QL;

THE MYSTERIOUS TALE OF A DEBATE TAPE GETS STRANGER  
</HEADLINE>
   By JAMES DAO    
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ The strangest story line of the presidential
campaign to date _ the case of the stolen Bush debate materials _
got a whole lot stranger Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   The day started with reports in Texas newspapers quoting
Democratic officials who said the Bush campaign itself had mailed
the debate materials to an adviser to Vice President Al Gore as a
sort of dirty trick intended to raise suspicions of Democratic
thievery. The reports prompted Bush's spokeswoman to issue a stern
denial on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   By midafternoon, Bush himself was on MSNBC denying the
Democratic charges while asserting that the real thief was
``sweating bullets'' because FBI agents were ``beginning to hone
in.''
</P>
<P>
   And by late afternoon, The Dallas Morning News had reported in
its online editions that FBI agents had focused their investigation
on an employee of the advertising firm doing Bush's campaign
commercials. The employee, Yvette Lozano, could be seen on a Postal
Service surveillance videotape mailing a package on Sept. 11, at
about the time that the debate materials would have been sent, the
newspaper reported.
</P>
<P>
   Her explanation? She was returning a pair of $19.99 Gap khaki
pants that her boss, Mark McKinnon of Maverick Media, had bought on
the Internet. McKinnon even produced the pants for a reporter from
The Dallas Morning News.
</P>
<P>
   An FBI spokesman refused to say whether agents had interviewed
Lozano. ``All I can say is we have initiated a preliminary
investigation,'' said the spokesman, Paul Bresson. ``At this point,
we can't even determine if any federal laws have been violated.''
</P>
<P>
   The tale began on Sept. 13 when former Rep. Thomas Downey
received a package with an Austin, Tex., postmark containing a
video of a mock debate between Bush and Sen. Judd Gregg, as well as
some briefing books. Downey turned the materials over to the FBI,
which opened an investigation.
</P>
<P>
   It took its first bizarre turn a week ago when the Gore campaign
suspended a 28-year-old campaign worker who had bragged to a friend
that the Democrats might have a ``mole'' inside the Bush campaign.
Gore's aides say there is no mole and that the suspended worker,
Michael Doyne, had made the story up.
</P>
<P>
   On Tuesday, Karen P. Hughes, Bush's communications director,
complained that the FBI did not seem to be taking Doyne's case
seriously enough and was instead spending too much time
interviewing Bush campaign workers.
</P>
<P>
   ``I hope the FBI and the federal law enforcement agencies would
follow up on that boast by looking at computer hard drives to
determine whether in fact there is any substance to those
comments,'' she told reporters.
</P>
<P>
   Hughes also rejected out of hand assertions by Molly Beth
Malcolm, chairwoman of the Texas Democratic Party, that the
pilfered debate materials were actually sent to Downey by Karl
Rove, Bush's chief political consultant. Democrats contend Rove
bugged his own campaign office during the 1986 gubernatorial
campaign in order to cast aspersions on the Democrats.
</P>
<P>
   She said she was certain that none of Bush's top advisers would
have sent the materials, adding, ``I'm sure they'd all be happy''
to take lie detector tests to prove their innocence.
</P>
<P>
   Kym Spell, a spokeswoman for the Gore campaign, responded,
``This matter is in the hands of professional, experienced
investigators of the FBI. The Gore campaign is comfortable with
that. For some reason, the Bush campaign is not.''

CLINTON PROPOSES BAN ON ADS FOR CHILDREN 
</HEADLINE>
  By ADAM NAGOURNEY   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   CEDARHURST, N.Y. _ Declaring that advertisers were directing a
``barrage of materialistic marketing'' at children, Hillary Rodham
Clinton on Tuesday called on the federal government to ban
commercials aimed at preschool children, and to prohibit
advertising inside public elementary schools.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton, in the second of two days of campaigning directed at
Jewish audiences, said the Federal Trade Commission should be
authorized to ban advertising that it determines is intended for
children susceptible to manipulation. She also called for
legislation that would prohibit the marketing of materials to
children in elementary schools, as in book covers with
advertisements.
</P>
<P>
   ``Too many companies simply see our children as little cash cows
that they can exploit,'' Clinton said as she introduced what her
advisers described as a new theme in her campaign, a topic that she
raised with increasing vigor throughout a day of campaigning on
Long Island and in Manhattan and the Bronx.
</P>
<P>
   ``We know that advertisers target the youngest of our
children,'' she said. ``Imagine. They are advertising to children
who have not yet even reached kindergarten. They are trying to get
these children to be influenced in what they want to buy and own.''
</P>
<P>
   She offered scant details of how such a regulation might be
accomplished, including, for example, how the government would
distinguish between an advertisement intended to influence adults
and one intended to manipulate children. Clinton's aides said that
under her proposal, that determination would be left to the trade
commission.
</P>
<P>
   The commission made a similar a proposal in 1978. Congress
responded two years later by stripping its authority to issue such
regulations, and Clinton essentially called for that authority to
be restored.
</P>
<P>
   The proposal is reminiscent of the kind of proposals that formed
the bedrock of President Clinton's 1996 re-election campaign, in
that it strikes what many politicians believe is a particularly
receptive chord among voters on an issue that Clinton's opponent is
unlikely to dispute her on.
</P>
<P>
   Lazio responded to Clinton's proposal not by attacking it, but
rather by offering a list of contributions she had received from
corporations that, he said, were guilty of the kind of offenses she
criticized. Lazio's spokesman, Dan McLagan, said that she did not
have the grounding to make such a proposal.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everybody likes kids,'' McLagan said. ``Her program sounds
nice, but it's difficult to take her seriously because she's a
wholly owned subsidiary of Hollywood and the entertainment
industry.''

EXCERPTS FROM MARKET RESEARCH DOCUMENTS ON A VIOLENT FILM 
</HEADLINE>
   (With VIOLENCE-KIDS-FILMS)  
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Following are excerpts from documents of the National Research
Group, the dominant market research organization for major studios
about its work on the movie, ``I Know What You Did Last Summer.''
</P>
<P>
   Per our conversation here is a suggested research plan for ``I
Know What You Did Last Summer.''
</P>
<P>
   The survey will be conducted among those who saw the original
movie. Since the bulk of the audiences were moviegoers between 12
and 24, it is suggested that the sample be comprised mostly of 12-
to 24-year-olds, half between 12 and 17 and half between 18 and 24.
Although the original movie was R rated and the sequel will also be
R rated, there is evidence to suggest that attendance at the
original dipped down to the age of 10. Therefore, it seems to make
sense to interview 10- to 11-year-olds as well. In addition we will
survey African-American and Latino moviegoers between the ages of
10 and 24.
</P>
<P>
   The lines of questioning will include, but not be limited to the
following:
</P>
<P>
   ABOUT THE FIRST MOVIE:
</P>
<P>
   favorite character &QL;
</P>
<P>
   other liked characters &QL;
</P>
<P>
   most memorable scene &QL;
</P>
<P>
   favorite scene &QL;
</P>
<P>
   other scenes liked &QL;
</P>
<P>
   scariest scene &QL;
</P>
<P>
   THE SAMPLE &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The sample will be comprised of 500 moviegoers between the ages
of 12 and 24 and 100 moviegoers between the ages of 9 and 11. In
addition 150 African-Americans and Latinos between the ages of 12
and 24 and 50 between the ages of 9 and 11 equally divided by
gender will be interviewed. Therefore, in total 900 interviews will
be carried out.
</P>
<P>
   THE ANALYSIS &QL;
</P>
<P>
   This research will determine who are the most intense fans of
the movie by age, gender, ethnicity, etc. and what drives their
zeal. The results will also define the primary and secondary
targets and what about the movie most appeals to them. It will also
provide information on the key aspects of the original movie most
liked and guidance for the direction of the second movie.

TITLE GAME IS LISA'S SHOW
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By DOUG KRIKORIAN  
 c.2000 Long Beach Press-Telegram  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SYDNEY, Australia _ It wasn't Lisa Fernandez's most overwhelming
pitching performance. After all, she issued a walk as early as the
first inning, gave up a single as early as the second inning and
even allowed a home run as early as the fourth.
</P>
<P>
   And she only managed eight strikeouts during her eight innings
of work and actually was roughed up for three hits.
</P>
<P>
   But no matter.
</P>
<P>
   When the United States-Japan gold-medal softball game was over,
when she happily joined the triumphant mob scene at home plate with
her teammates, when she paraded around the stadium holding the
American flag, Fernandez once again had validated her status as the
greatest player in her sport.
</P>
<P>
   Even if she were only a mere shadow of herself, she was good
enough to beat a resourceful Japan team 2-1 _ a team that had gone
8-0 since arriving in Sydney. And she was good enough to add
another Olympic medal to her burgeoning trophy case.
</P>
<P>
   ``Winning this gold medal feels even better than the 1996 one in
Atlanta because we had to overcome so much adversity to do it,''
said Fernandez moments after the her team had scored an unearned ru
the proceedings in the bottom of the eighth. The Japanese left
fielder misjudged a fly ball hit by Laura Berg when the rain
started drenching Blacktown Softball Centre.
</P>
<P>
   ``I definitely didn't have my best stuff and struggled
throughout the game. And that's what makes this gold medal so
sweet. It seemed like we struggled the whole time we were here and
no one gave us a chance when we lost those three games in a row.
But we hung in there, never gave up and came out on top.''
</P>
<P>
   The Americans pulled off a most unlikely revenge trifecta _
beating the three teams that had upset them earlier in the
tournament, China, Australia and Japan, in one harrowing 24-hour
period to contin reign atop the softball universe.
</P>
<P>
   Fernandez played the decisive role in the remarkable comeback,
silencing Australia 1-0 on a one-hitter Monday night and then
coming back Tuesday night without any rest and repulsing a fast,
clever Japanese team that seemed to be on the threshold of
dethroning the Americans.
</P>
<P>
   ``Lisa wasn't at the top of her game tonight, but she showed
what a warrior she was by hanging in there and getting the job
done,'' said her catcher, Stacey Nuveman, who tied the game at 1-1
in the fifth inning with a two-out single, the Americans' only hit.
``She showed t a champion.''
</P>
<P>
   Fernandez allowed only two earned runs and seven hits in 29
innings in her four pitching appearances here, but it's what she
did the past couple of evenings that stood out far more than even
her 25-strikeout masterpiece in a losing effort last week against
the Aussies.
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. coach, Ralph Raymond, has such respect for Fernandez
that he passed over a couple of rested pitchers with solid
credentials, Lori Harrigan and Christa Williams, to go with the
Long Beach native who graduated from St. Joseph High.
</P>
<P>
   It was a wise decision by Raymond, just as it was a wise
decision by Walter Alston back in 1965 when he pitched Sandy Koufax
on two days rest instead of Don Drysdale in the seventh game of the
World Series between the Dodgers and Minnesota Twins. Koufax
affirmed Alston's faith in him by shutting out the Twins on two
hits.
</P>
<P>
   Fernandez affirmed Raymond's faith in her with a heroic effort
on a night when her fastball didn't have its usual speed and when
her infielders, especially shortstop Crystl Bustos, made several
deft plays to rescue her from certain trouble.
</P>
<P>
   ``This was a total team effort _ everyone contributed in some
way,'' said Fernandez. ``When we fell behind, my teammates kept
encouraging me each time we'd come off the field. They'd say, `Just
keep fighting. Just keep fighting.' ''
</P>
<P>
   And Fernandez did just that, especially after Reika Utsugi had
perfectly timed a changeup and sent it over the center-field fence,
barely eluding the grasp of Berg.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just didn't have it together in the early going and I think
they were reading my pitching signs,'' she said. ``I definitely
think I was `picked' on that home run. She was waiting for that
changeup, knew it was coming. We changed our signs after that.''
</P>
<P>
   And after that, the hustling team from Japan _ its tiny center
fielder, Hiroko Tamoto, would do a Maurice Greene imitation when
going to her position and then bow to an adoring crowd _ never was
able to solve Fernandez's array of pitches.
</P>
<P>
   Fernandez was emotional afterward _ as were all her teammates _
as she sang the national anthem and kept waving the American flag.
She would say she felt patriotic and a keen love for her country
because her father, Ricardo Fernandez, was one of the refugees who
escaped Cuba after the Bay of Pigs in 1962.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm just glad I'm able to represent the United States and do
something nice for a country that gave my father a place to live
under a government not run by a dictator,'' said Fernandez.
</P>
<P>
   She would go on to say how good she felt and how appreciative
she was of her teammates and how wonderful it was to be able to
overcome all the hardships of the past 10 days. Ralph Raymond
listened quietly and later saluted his biggest star.
</P>
<P>
   ``What a gamer Lisa is!'' he said. ``I never hesitated one
moment about pitching her tonight. When you have her talent and her
heart, you have to go with her. I wanted to win that gold and I
just knew Lisa would bring it home.''
</P>
<P>
   Fernandez certainly did.

LAWRENCE G. HAUCK, 88, FORMER NEWS EDITOR OF NEW YORK TIMES 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: N.C., Pa. Ohio, Mich.. Fla.)   By EDWARD WONG   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service

<P>
   Lawrence G. Hauck, a former news editor of The New York Times,
died Sept. 26 at a hospice in Winston-Salem, N.C. He was 88 and
lived in High Point, N.C.
</P>
<P>
   In almost three decades at The Times, Hauck oversaw a diverse
array of the newspaper's operations, from managing United Nations
reporting in Paris to directing coverage of the Republican and
Democratic National Conventions in two election years.
</P>
<P>
   In the 1960s, Hauck was the editor of regional editions when The
Times first experimented with remote makeup and printing for the
Western United States and in Europe. Hauck oversaw the selection
and editing of articles in New York that were sent by
teletypewriter to both Paris and Los Angeles for printing. The
Paris edition lasted until 1967, when it was merged with the Paris
edition of The Herald Tribune into what then became The
International Herald Tribune.
</P>
<P>
   The Los Angeles edition, distributed in 13 Western states,
including Alaska and Hawaii, lasted for two years; it became a
victim of production costs in the pre-computer era.
</P>
<P>
   Hauck joined the newspaper in 1948 as a copy editor on the
foreign desk. Before that, he worked as a reporter and editor for
Ohio newspapers and for The Associated Press.
</P>
<P>
   He was born on Aug. 11, 1912, in Fairview, Pa. At the time, the
town had a population of 571. After graduating from Ohio University
in 1933, he worked at a series of small Ohio newspapers, then at
The Detroit Free Press, before joining The Associated Press.
</P>
<P>
   Hauck married Esther L. Kernan in 1941. The two later divorced,
and Hauck married Ann Kinney McLean in 1964; Mrs. Hauck died in
1989.
</P>
<P>
   In World War II, Hauck became a Navy pilot, ending the war with
the rank of lieutenant commander; he served in South America and in
the Pacific.
</P>
<P>
   He returned to The Associated Press and covered the United
Nations for two years. In 1948, he joined the foreign desk of The
Times and oversaw a special operation set up to cover sessions of
the United Nations General Assembly. In 1951, he moved to Paris
when the General Assembly held its meeting there.
</P>
<P>
   In 1953, he joined the Washington bureau as a night news editor.
Over the next decade, he also taught journalism at Brooklyn College
and New York University.
</P>
<P>
   Hauck was promoted to news editor in 1976; he retired the next
year.
</P>
<P>
   Throughout his career at The Times, Hauck wrote articles on
subjects ranging from novels by Iris Murdoch to a trip to the
Adriatic port town of Dubrovnik, then in Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
   After retirement, Hauck moved with his wife from the Upper West
Side of Manhattan to Lake Worth, Fla. He moved to North Carolina
three years ago.
</P>
<P>
   Hauck leaves no immediate survivors.

RADIO TO BROADCAST ALL NEWS, ALL THE TIME, ALL IN SPANISH  
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Md.)  By JAYSON BLAIR    
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ When WNNY-AM (1380) turns on its microphones
Wednesday at noon, the station will become the New York region's
first all-news, all-the-time Spanish-language radio station. To
many industry analysts, that is a sign of advertiser interest in
the growing buying power of the nation's Hispanic listeners.
</P>
<P>
   Mega Communications, a privately owned Hispanic radio
conglomerate, recently bought the station, which had been known as
WDKM, in a deal valued at $45 million. It then changed its call
letters to WNNY, switching its Spanish-music format to all news.
</P>
<P>
   The Spanish-language radio market in New York could generate an
estimated $85 million in annual revenues, and there are already
five stations catering to its audience. Those stations already
capture about 10 percent of the region's radio listeners.
</P>
<P>
   WNNY will have a news staff of about 40 people and broadcast a
format similar to that of WINS-AM (1010) and WCBS-AM (880). While
the station has only a 5,000-megawatt signal, it easily reaches
areas of Upper Manhattan, the Bronx and northern New Jersey that
have dense clusters of Hispanic residents, company officials said.
Stations like all-news WCBS and WINS, as well as the Spanish
station WADO-AM (1280) transmit at 50,000 megawatts.
</P>
<P>
   ``One in five people in New York is of Hispanic origin,'' Adam
Lindemann, the president of Mega Communications and the heir to his
father's cellular telephone fortune, said in an interview
yesterday. ``One in 10 stations in New York are Spanish, so if you
just correlate radio stations with population, there are about half
as many as there should be.''
</P>
<P>
   James Marsh, an analyst at Prudential Securities, said that
there was some concern about whether WNNY's 5,000-megawatt
transmitter had the power to draw enough listeners, and that some
feared advertising revenue might be drying up across the board. But
Marsh said that returns in the radio industry had been fairly
favorable, especially in the Hispanic market, to which advertisers
were increasingly turning.
</P>
<P>
   The strength of Mega Communications seems to be a testament to
that, he said. The company, based in Silver Spring, Md., has grown
in four short years from a fledgling startup to the country's
fourth-largest Hispanic radio broadcaster, boasting 20 stations,
all on the East Coast.
</P>
<P>
   Lindemann said that the company's research suggested that many
Spanish listeners were interested in news more geared toward them.
The success of the music and talk format stations in bringing
advertisers to Spanish outlets and the success of WINS and WCBS
have made it easier to persuade advertisers to sign on, he added.
