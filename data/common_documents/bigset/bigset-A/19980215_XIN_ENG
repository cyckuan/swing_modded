<HEADLINE> Roses Express Love on Valentine's Day </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, February 14 (Xinhua) -- Beijing flower shops counted
the days before the arrival of Valentine's Day, with brisk sales
making the wait well worthwhile.
</P>
<P>
Sales clerks say young people seem oblivious to the high cost
of roses which they feel are an ideal gift to express their ardent
love.
</P>
<P>
"Not a single customer argued about the prices," said a sales
clerk in Xidan, one of Beijing's busiest commercial centers. She
said a single rose sells for 10-20 yuan on Valentine's Day,
depending on the size, color, freshness and packaging. A rose
normally sells at only five yuan.
</P>
<P>
Beijing's streets were decorated with flowers today, with shops
placing baskets of roses at their entrances. Shiny silver paper
protected bouquets of roses from the somewhat cold spring wind.
</P>
<P>
Flower shops were not the only establishments attempting to
cash in on today's romantic mood. For example, department stores,
restaurants and hotels presented roses to customers exceeding a
specified purchase limit.
</P>
<P>
A poll in 10 major cities indicated that nearly half of
respondents over the age of 18 planned special expressions of
affection to their beloved on Valentine's Day.
</P>
<P>
Experts observed the trends for an ever increasing number of
people to adopt this particular western custom for romance.
</P>
<P>
Jia Fei, 29, said his girlfriend often complains of his
dullness. Jia purchased a rose today before going to her home.
</P>
<P>
"She hinted that a rose would be nice," said Jia. "I would have
certainly appeared ridiculous had I visited empty-handed."
</P>
<P>
Jia blushed and commented, "I hope it will be different this
time."

<TEXT>
<P>
SHANGHAI, February 14 (Xinhua) -- A group of 12-odd U.S.,
Japanese and Indian students attending a Shanghai international
school donated some 2,5000 yuan to help Chen Xin, a local primary
school student.
</P>
<P>
"It makes me happy to help Chinese friends at my age," said a
young American student named Evan. The philanthropic students
raised the money by selling cakes made by their parents.
</P>
<P>
The donation marked the seventh time Shanghai's foreign
community has provided assistance to local students from poor
families. Women from the foreign community launched the Shanghai
Sunrise Program two years ago to provide financial assistance to
poor students.
</P>
<P>
An increasing number of foreigners and overseas companies have
since joined the program. The Shanghai Jing'an Hilton Hotel has
hosted seven related presentation ceremonies free of charge.
</P>
<P>
Seventy-two foreigners from 16 countries and regions, including
Germany, the United States, the Philippines, Canada, Hong Kong and
Taiwan, attended today ceremony and donated a total of 284,000
yuan to help 71 needy students.

<HEADLINE> 76 Egyptian Prisoners in Iraq Released </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, February 14 (Xinhua) -- The Iraqi authorities Saturday
set free the second batch of Egyptian prisoners held in Iraq in
line with the Iraqi presidential decree, the Egypt's Middle East
News Agency reported.
</P>
<P>
On February 5, Iraqi President Saddam Hussein ordered the
prompt release of all Arab prisoners held in the country.
</P>
<P>
MENA quoted an official source at the Egyptian interests
mission in Iraq as saying that the second batch raised the number
of the released Egyptians to 100.
</P>
<P>
The first batch of Egyptian prisoners was set free Thursday.
</P>
<P>
A total of 578 Egyptians are held behind bars in Iraq,
according to the mission source.
</P>
<P>
The general pardon came as a direct spinoff of the recent
consultations between Saddam and Arab League Secretary General
Esmat Abdel-Meguid during his visit in Baghdad last week to defuse
the escalating crisis over the United Nations arms inspection in
Iraq.
</P>
<P>
Arab countries oppose the use of force as threatened by the
U.S. to coerce Iraq into opening its presidential sites suspected
of hiding lethal weapons to international arms experts.

<TEXT>
<P>
BAGHDAD, February 14 (Xinhua) -- Russian politician Vladimir
Zhirinovsky has said he will ask the Russian government to send
naval force to the Gulf amid mounting U.S. military threat against
Iraq, the local Republic newspaper reported Saturday.
</P>
<P>
Zhirinovsky, leader of the Russian Liberal Democratic Party,
warned that if the United States launches military strike against
Iraq, Russia should do the same to America, the paper said.
</P>
<P>
He told the paper Friday that he would call on the Russian
government to renew the Russian-Iraqi Friendship Treaty signed in
1972.
</P>
<P>
If U.S. President Bill Clinton agrees, Zhirinovsky said he
would suggest that Clinton, Boris Yeltsin and Saddam Hussein,
presidents of Russia and Iraq, hold a meeting to discuss the
standoff over arms inspections between Iraq and the United
Nations, and try to find a solution.
</P>
<P>
U.S. military presence in the Gulf is dangerous for the
regional security and stability, he added.
</P>
<P>
The Russian politician heading a delegation of the Russian Duma
arrived here Thursday. The delegation brought eight tonnes of
medicine and medical equipment to Iraq.
</P>
<P>
Zhirinovsky announced that he will leave here together with
some Iraqi patients, and send them to Russian hospitals.

<HEADLINE> Ottawa Raises Tobacco Tax </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
OTTAWA, February 14 (Xinhua) -- Smokers in most of eastern
Canada will pay more for their cigarettes starting from Saturday
as a result of government tax increase aimed at stopping young
people from smoking.
</P>
<P>
Tobacco taxes will rise in the Canadian provinces of Ontario,
Quebec, Nova Scotia and Prince Edward Island by 1.20 dollars (0.83
USD) a carton and 80 cents in New Brunswick.
</P>
<P>
Half of the increase is being levied by the five provincial
governments and half by Ottawa, which says higher prices will help
stop teens from smoking.
</P>
<P>
Anti-smoking groups have been pressing Ottawa to raise tobacco
prices, and the latest move was welcomed as a moderate step
forward.
</P>
<P>
Yet, the new tax hike will not affect the western provinces,
which let their tobacco taxes stand while the rest of the country
cut cigarettes taxes in 1994 as way of curbing rampant
cross-border smuggling.

<P>
AMSTERDAM, February 14 (Xinhua) -- Chinese Premier Li Peng
arrived in Amsterdam Saturday for a four-day official good-will
visit, the second leg of his week-long, three-nation European tour.
</P>
<P>
Li, the first Chinese premier to visit the Netherlands since
1985, came here at noon as the guest of Dutch Prime Minister Wim
Kok.
</P>
<P>
He was accorded a sunny-day, red-carpet welcome at the airport
and reviewed the guards of honor of the Dutch armed forces in his
host's company.
</P>
<P>
In a written speech upon arrival, Li said he was "very pleased"
to pay a visit to the Netherlands, noting that friendly exchanges
and contacts between the two countries dated back centuries
although the two were far apart geographically.
</P>
<P>
"Moreover, we are very delighted to see the considerable
progress of our state-to-state relations, especially since the
establishment of our diplomatic relations, which is manifest in
the frequent exchanges of high-level visits, fruitful economic
cooperation and trade and the continuous expansion of the
scientific, technological and cultural cooperation," Li said.
</P>
<P>
Li said that despite differences in the historical and cultural
background and level of development, "Our two countries share many
common views on safeguarding world peace, promoting economic
development and enhancing cooperation and exchanges."
</P>
<P>
Hence, "it is in the fundamental interests of our two countries
and also the common interests of both Asia and Europe to develop
our bilateral relationship on the basis of mutual respect,
equality and mutual benefit."
</P>
<P>
He said that during the ongoing visit, "I am looking forward to
an in-depth exchange of views with leaders of the Netherlands on
bilateral relations and other international issues of common
interest."
</P>
<P>
Li said he was willing to get to know more people from all
circles in the Netherlands and to strive for the sound and smooth
growth of friendly relations and cooperation between China and the
Netherlands.
</P>
<P>
"I believe that, with the thoughtful arrangement of the
government of the Netherlands, my current visit will achieve its
goals," the premier said.
</P>
<P>
Li's entourage include his wife Zhu Lin, Director of the
Foreign Affairs Office of the State Council Liu Huaqiu, Governor
of Guangdong Province Lu Ruihua, Chinese ambassador to the

Li arrived here from a two-day visit in Luxembourg, where he
was seen off at the airport by Luxembourg Prime Minister
Jean-Claude Juncker earlier Saturday.

<HEADLINE> Domestic Demand to Drive Canadian Economy, Bank </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
OTTAWA, February 14 (Xinhua) -- Canadian industries associated
with consumer demand are set to outperform the overall economy in
the next two years, according to a study by Canadian Imperial Bank
of Commerce.
</P>
<P>
Furniture and appliance manufacturers will show the strongest
growth in output.
</P>
<P>
In contrast, natural resource industries are expected to
underperform the general economy, with an actual decline in output
of the mining and lumber sectors.
</P>
<P>
"There is a real demarcation between industries driven by
domestic demand and those which depend heavily on global demand,"
the bank's senior economist Anahid Mamourian was quoted as saying
by Saturday's Financial Post.
</P>
<P>
With growth moderating in the U.S. and dropping in Asia, the
domestic consumer will become the key driver of the Canadian
economy through to the end of 1999.
</P>
<P>
Output of furniture and fixtures is seen to grow 11.5 percent,
outperform the 2.9 percent growth in the general economy.
</P>
<P>
With a thriving housing market, construction, electrical
products and appliances are all expected to enjoy a large jump in
output.
</P>
<P>
In the meantime, the country's metal mining will drop 4.2
percent this year and only a modest recovery is expected next
year.
</P>
<P>
The prospects for the wood products industry is expected to
stagnate and then decline as U.S. residential construction
activity slows, the bank said.

<HEADLINE> Somali National Conference Postponed to March 31 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOGADISHU, February 14 (Xinhua) -- The Somali national
reconciliation conference originally planned to be held in Baidoa
on Sunday was postponed till March 31, according to a press
briefing here Saturday.
</P>
<P>
The new date was announced by Ali Mahdi Mohamed and Hussein
Mohamed Aidid, the co-chairmen of the Cairo declaration, at a
short briefing here at the end of a meeting of the National
Coordinating Committee known as the Cairo Peace Deal signatories.
</P>
<P>
The meeting held at a hotel in Yaqshid district of Mogadishu
and attended by 20 members out of the 28 Cairo signatories was
aimed at deciding on a new date for the convening of the Baidoa
National Reconciliation Conference which was earlier scheduled to
begin on February 15 or Sunday.
</P>
<P>
Mahdi told reporters that the postponement of the conference
was prompted by what he described as technical problems, which
include obstacles created by the recent floods that cut off the
main road between Mogadishu and Baidoa, 250 km to the southwest,
late last year and lack of financial support for convening the
conference.
</P>
<P>
He said during the next 45 days before the conference, the
leaders in the capital will be able to solve the problems in
Mogadishu including the reopening of the airport and sea port and
the formation of a unified administration for Mogadishu.
</P>
<P>
According to the faction leaders who were attending the
meeting, they unanimously agreed upon the new time set for the
national conference in which a government of national unity will
be established in the town of Baidoa.
</P>
<P>
This meeting took place in less than 12 hours after the
delegations led by Hussein Mohamed Aidid and Osman Ali Atto
returned after paying an unexpected four-day visit to Libya.
</P>
<P>
According to sources close to the delegations, the two faction
leaders have met senior officials from the Libyan government of
Colonel Moammar Al-Gaddafi and discussed how the Libyan
government could assist in the current peace activities in
Mogadishu.

<P>
ADDIS ABABA, February 14 (Xinhua) -- Schools in Ethiopia have
been urged to offer students subjects dealing with the country's
history, relics and heritages.
</P>
<P>
The call came from Professor Tadesse Tamirat, a historian and
publishing director general of the Addis Ababa University, at a
meeting organized by the Ministry of Information and Culture here
Friday, the Ethiopian News Agency reported.
</P>
<P>
Tadesse said that such education will deepen the knowledge of
the students about the country's heritages and their
significance.
</P>
<P>
Students made well aware of the above-mentioned subjects will
care for their heritages and live up to expectations to pass them
onto posterity, he said.
</P>
<P>
Although there are historical footprints showing that Ethiopia
is the cradle of mankind and a forerunner in ancient
civilization, the professor said, no adequate researches have so
far been made on the issues.
</P>
<P>
He also urged to provide experts in the field with relevant
trainings at the national levels so as to raise awareness among
the public and make the country benefit from the field.

BEIRUT, February 14 (Xinhua) -- One Lebanese civilian was
wounded Saturday in Israeli shelling in south Lebanon, the
official Lebanese Radio reported.
</P>
<P>
The Israeli troops bombarded the village of Habush, about 73
kilometers southeast of Beirut, the radio said.
</P>
<P>
The heavy shelling also destroyed a number of houses at the
nearby village of Kaferamen, the radio added.
</P>
<P>
In retaliation for the Israeli offensive, the Iranian-backed
Lebanese Hezbollah attacked an Israeli outpost in Turra in an area
occupied by Israel in south Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
An Israel radio was quoted as saying that no casualties were
made by the guerrilla attack.
</P>
<P>
But the pro-Israeli South Lebanese Army (SLA) said that the
attack caused heavy casualties of the SLA.
</P>
<P>
Israel set up a security zone in 1985 in south Lebanon to
allegedly protect its northern areas from cross-border attacks by
Lebanese guerrillas.
</P>
<P>
Lebanese Muslim resistance forces have been fighting since then
to drive the Israeli troops out of Lebanon.

CAIRO, February 14 (Xinhua) -- Egypt and Sudan Saturday resumed
the navigation on the Nile River after a hiatus of more than three
years, the Middle East News Agency reported.
</P>
<P>
Egyptian Minister of Transport and Communications Soliman
Metwalli Soliman attended a ceremony in the city of Aswan, about
900 kilometers south of Cairo, marking the restart of a steamer
service from Aswan to the Sudanese port of Halfa.
</P>
<P>
The resumption of the route, a response to an initiative of
Sudan, embodies promotion of ties between the two Nile Valley
countries, Soliman said at the ceremony.
</P>
<P>
The steamer service is provided by the Nile Valley Transport
Corporation, which was set up in 1974 to carry goods and
passengers between the two countries.
</P>
<P>
Egypt and Sudan signed an agreement last December to resume the
service, which has been hailed by the two sides as a sign of
improvement of the bilateral relations.
</P>
<P>
The service across the Lake Nasser in Egypt was suspended in
1994 when the relations between the two neighbors became tense.
</P>

Egypt used to accuse Sudan of sheltering and supporting Islamic

<HEADLINE> Jordan Urges Iraq to Comply With UN Resolutions </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
AMMAN, February 14 (Xinhua) -- Jordan Saturday urged Iraq to
comply with the United Nations resolutions in a bid to seek a
diplomatic solution to the crisis over arms inspections, the
official Jordanian news agency Petra reported.
</P>
<P>
The time for diplomatic efforts to defuse the crisis is ticking
away fast, a statement issued by the Jordanian government said.
</P>
<P>
As "the time factor is becoming increasingly pressing," Jordan
hoped that Iraq will implement the resolutions for the lifting of
the economic sanctions imposed by the U.N., the statement carried
by the Petra said.
</P>
<P>
The statement came when U.N. Secretary General Kofi Annan
announced that a technical group will go to Baghdad to discuss the
inspection of eight presidential sites Iraq has agreed to open to
the U.N. arms inspectors and that he himself may visit Baghdad
soon.
</P>
<P>
Jordan expressed welcome to the development and reiterated its
"keen interest to avoid a dead-end for the diplomatic efforts."
</P>
<P>
The statement added that Jordan is against any war in the
region, for it will bring serious and negative impact "not only on
Iraq, but also on the entire region."
</P>
<P>
Iraq's proposal to open the eight presidential sites under
certain conditions has been rejected by the U.S., which warns that

<HEADLINE> WFP Concerned Over More Rainfall in Flooded </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, February 14 (Xinhua) -- The U.N. World Food Program
(WFP) expressed concern Saturday over predictions of possible
increase in seasonal rainfall between March and May in southern
Somalia.
</P>
<P>
A news release issued by WFP here Saturday said that any
amount of rains in the flooded southern Somalia, especially Lower
Juba and Shabelle regions, would be devastating.
</P>
<P>
Erminio Sacco, Coordinator of WFP's Food Security Assessment
Unit, noted that with rivers already full, embankments broken and
surrounding grounds saturated, there would be no outlet for the
extra rain water.
</P>
<P>
According to a report delivered by a group of meteorological
experts at the Climate Outlook Forum held here earlier this week,
there is a high probability of average to above average rainfall
expected during the March to May rainy season.
</P>
<P>
Southern Somalia has been hit by torrential rains since last
November with floods persisting in the densely populated and
agriculturally rich Lower Juba and Shabelle regions.
</P>
<P>
With many villages being under one meter of water in the
flooded regions, WFP will continue to rely upon air transport and
boats as the only means of delivering relief food to Somali
people.
</P>
<P>
Since the beginning of the emergency operation in November
1997, WFP has delivered 5,377 tons of food to flood affected
areas in Somalia, assisting more than 450,000 people.

<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, February 14 (Xinhua) -- South African President
Nelson Mandela said Saturday in Maputo, Mozambique that his
government is closing down many airports in an effort to halt
illegal flights to neighboring countries.
</P>
<P>
The move comes after a recent incident in which a South
African plane carrying building materials for UNITA, a former
rebel group in Angola, was intercepted by the Angolan air forcee,
South African Press Association reported.
</P>
<P>
"We have had a situation where we had a lot of airports in
South Africa. We are closing many of them leaving only a few
where we can guarantee a security of all flights and ensure that
flights are properly checked," Mandela said when asked about the
incident.
</P>
<P>
He said he is convinced that in the near future flights from
South Africa to neighboring countries will be under control.
</P>
<P>
He said the South African government had identified some of
the people operating illegal flights, but he refused to mention
them for security reasons.
</P>
<P>
Mandela was in Maputo for talks with Mozambican President
Joachim Chissano over regional affairs.

<HEADLINE> WHO Role in Africa Commended </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, February 14 (Xinhua) -- Regional Director for Africa
of the World Health Organization (WHO) Ebrahim Samba Saturday
commended the role played by WHO in conflict prevention,
management and reconstruction across africa.
</P>
<P>
Africa is experiencing an epidemic of conflicts and
emergencies which are doing havoc to the health situation, he
said.
</P>
<P>
In a statement Samba noted that crisis situations create a
general breakdown of infrastructure and sometimes total collapse
of social and government structures.
</P>
<P>
''WHO is well placed to play a key role in conflict situations
because it has offices and representatives in all the 46
countries of the region. WHO has the advantage that its
representatives usually know the terrain and some of the people
involved in the conflicts,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
''It is always more able to respond to conflicts than some of
the other agencies and partners which only come in after the
conflict or emergency situation is fully developed and leave as
soon as it starts to subside,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
Because of this advantage, he said, WHO can play a leading
role in the preparation of material that can be used to manage
such conflicts. It can provide an estimate of the number of
people affected and their needs for drugs, vaccines and other
materials to deal with certain health problems.
</P>
<P>
Samba said, ''at a stage during Burundi crisis in 1994 to
1995, the ministry of health was no longer functioning as
expected and it was WHO which got other agencies and partners
together and operated the health services.''
</P>
<P>
''Conflicts may start suddenly, but they never end suddenly.
Even after the crisis, there is always need for rehabilitation,
reinstallation, repairs and building of health and health-related
facilities and activities,'' he added.

HARARE, February 14 (Xinhua) -- Most crops in Zimbabwe are in
a satisfactory condition following the heavy rains which pounded
most parts of the country recently, the Department of
Agricultural, Technical and Extension Services has said.
</P>
<P>
In its fortnightly report released Saturday, the department
said the rains significantly improved the condition of maize
although they caused water logging and leaching in some areas in
the northern parts of the country.
</P>
<P>
"Crop condition is generally fair to good," although signs of
misfortune "are beginning to show due to the current dry spell
and more rains are required across the whole country," it said.
</P>
<P>
Other crops including groundnuts, soybeans and tobacco were
also in a satisfactory condition except cotton, which has
developed boll rot in Masvingo and Mashonaland provinces due to
excessive rains.

<HEADLINE> Nigeria Begins Aluminum Export </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, February 14 (Xinhua) -- Nigeria has exported the first
batch of aluminum ingots totaling 1,800 tons to the United
States, a bold step to diversify exports to reduce its
over-dependence on oil.
</P>
<P>
The event seems so important to the country that Power and
Steel Minister Babagana Kingibe was at the harbor more than 400
km away from the capital Abuja to flag off the consignment
Friday.
</P>
<P>
The ingots were produced by the Aluminum Smelter Company in
eastern Nigeria's Akwa Ibom State, with the help of two technical
partners from Germany and the United States.
</P>
<P>
According to the minister, the company will try to attain an
annual production capacity of 193,000 tons.
</P>
<P>
Nigeria is one of the world's leading producers and exporters
of crude oil, which accounts for two-thirds of the government's
foreign exchange income and revenue.
</P>
<P>
To reduce the over-dependence on oil, Nigeria has been over
the past few years encouraging the production and export of solid
minerals products.

<HEADLINE> Independent Body on Land Redistribution Urged in </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, February 14 (Xinhua) -- Zimbabwe's opposition United
Parties (UP) Saturday pushed for the creation of an independent
body of experts to oversee and supervise the controversial land
redistribution exercise in the country.
</P>
<P>
UP said following the designation by the government of more
than 1,500 commercial farms last year in order to fulfill
resettlement of thousands of blacks crammed in arid rural areas,
the whole exercise should be conducted and managed in a
transparent manner.
</P>
<P>
"Memories of farms designated in the name of the poor and
landless but allocated to government officials and ministers are
still fresh and should be avoided," said UP spokesman Isaac
Manyemba in a statement.
</P>
<P>
"Further we urge the creation of a non-partisan body of
experts to oversee and supervise land redistribution, because the
ZANU (PF) government structures have become incurably corrupt as
corruption has been institutionalized as an unwritten law," he
said.
</P>
<P>
He also commended the 4,500-strong Commercial Farmers Union's
(CFU) proposal to release immediately 1.5 million hectares owned
by its majority white-farmer members under the poverty
alleviation plan.
</P>
<P>
The CFU says it can also help the government raise up to 15
billion Zimbabwean Dollars (900 million U.S. Dollars) for the
exercise.
</P>
<P>
The CFU plan has already been criticized by some pressure
groups and individuals including the predominantly black
indigenous commercial farmers union which says the plan falls far
short of resolving the problem of landlessness.
</P>
<P>
However, the government's plans have also come under fire,
particularly its assertion that it will not pay for the land but
for the developments on the farms, arguing that the land was
initially grabbed from the blacks without compensation during the
colonial era.

CAIRO, February 14 (Xinhua) -- Egyptian Foreign Minister Amr
Moussa said Saturday the current international efforts to stave
off the military option in Iraq's standoff with the United Nations
are gathering strength.
</P>
<P>
"The diplomatic option is already beginning to bear fruit with
the U.S. contributing to political discussions afoot," Egypt's
Middle East News Agency quoted Moussa as saying.
</P>
<P>
Washington, backed by Britain, has threatened a military attack
if Iraq fails to comply with U.N. Security Council resolutions and
give full access to international arms inspectors.
</P>
<P>
Moussa stressed the importance of averting the military option
in order to "spare Iraq and the entire region a legion of
unwarranted consequences."
</P>
<P>
Egypt welcomes U.N. Secretary General Kofi Annan's prospective
visit to Baghdad with a view to boosting the current diplomatic
drive to defuse the crisis, Moussa said.

Baghdad on Sunday to survey eight presidential sites that Iraq has

<HEADLINE> PAN Accuses Israel of Breaching Agreements </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, February 14 (Xinhua) -- The Palestinian National
Authority (PNA) Saturday accused Israel of evading its commitment
to carrying out the signed peace agreements, the Jerusalem Media
and Communication Center reported.
</P>
<P>
The Israeli intransigence is causing an endless circle of
fruitless negotiations between the two sides, the PNA made the
accusation during a cabinet meeting in the West Bank city of
Ramallah.
</P>
<P>
The most blatant example is Israel's continued construction of
Jewish settlements in the Occupied Territories and expulsion of
Arab residents from East Jerusalem, said the meeting chaired by
PNA President Yasser Arafat.
</P>
<P>
The PNA called on the co-sponsors of the peace process, namely
the United States and Russia, to take necessary steps to force
Israel to stop all unilateral actions which damage the peace talks.
</P>
<P>
Palestinian chief negotiator Saeb Erekat and Arafat's advisor
Nabil Abu Rdeineh, who just returned from Washington talks with
Israeli Cabinet Secretary Danny Naveh, told the meeting that the
talks achieved no noticeable results.
</P>
<P>
They said that Israel attempted once again to avert its
responsibilities to implement the signed agreements during the
talks.
</P>
<P>
The PNA reaffirmed that the Palestinian side will remain
committed to the peace process and continue to contact with the
U.S..

<HEADLINE> 10 Arrested Following Bloody Clashes in Dar, </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, February 14 (Xinhua) -- The police Saturday
arrested 10 people for allegedly destroying four police posts and
vandalizing communication facilities in Dar es Salaam early in
the morning.
</P>
<P>
The Dar es Salaam Regional Police Commander Alfred Gewe told
reporters that the suspects were part of the hooligans who got
involved in a confrontation with armed security forces near a
mosque Friday in which two people were killed.
</P>
<P>
One of the deceased has been identified as a 30-year-old
teacher at an Islamic school, the other yet to be known.
</P>
<P>
The violence erupted Thursday evening when the police tried to
enter the Magomeni Mwembechai mosque to apprehend a group of
people belonging to an Islamic sect called Khidmat Daawat Islamia
for unlawfully organizing a religious gathering to insult other
religions.
</P>
<P>
As the police were approaching, a number of young men began to
throw stones at them and to destroy motor vehicles and other
properties.
</P>
<P>
Some 130 suspects were arrested for damaging 56 vehicles and
setting fire on two others, local newspapers said.
</P>
<P>
When the accused appeared in court Friday, the armed police
and members of the Field Force Unit fired into the air and used
tear gas to keep some 2,000 supporters from marching to the court
and the mosque area.
</P>
<P>
The Dar es Salaam Regional Commissioner Yusuf Makamba issued
an official statement Friday, saying the confrontation is not
between the government and Moslems, but between the government
organs and law breakers.
</P>
<P>
Tanzanian Prime Minister Frederick Sumaye, who was at the
closing session of the 10th National Assembly in Dodoma, has
warned that the government will mercilessly punish religious
instigators as peace is more precious than anything else.
</P>
<P>
He expressed grave concern over continued preachings which
provoked other religions despite a recent government directive
against such practice.

WASHINGTON, February 14 (Xinhua) -- President Bill Clinton on
Saturday called Danish Prime Minister Poul Nyrup Rasmussen and won
his support to the U.S. position on Iraq, the White House said.
</P>
<P>
"The president talked this morning with Prime Minister
Rasmussen of Denmark, and Denmark pledged to support our efforts
with respect to Iraq," a White House spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
Clinton was expected to be in contact with other world leaders
to discuss the showdown with Iraq on a dispute over weapons
inspections, the spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
The Clinton administration has started a campaign to muster
public support in the United States for a military action against
Iraq. And National Security Adviser Sandy Berger explained the
U.S. position on Iraq on Friday at the National Press Club in
Washington, D.C..
</P>
<P>
Clinton on Tuesday will go to the Pentagon for a briefing with
the Joint Chiefs of Staff of the military services and with
Defense Secretary William Cohen, who has just returned from a trip

</P>
<P>
Clinton will address military personnel there about the mission

action.
</P>
<P>

Albright will make an unusual joint appearance in Columbus, Ohio
to rally public opinion behind the tough stand by the Clinton
administration.

<HEADLINE> Iran: Attack on Iraq to Create Regional </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, February 14 (Xinhua) -- Iranian President Mohammad
Khatami said Saturday that an attack on Iraq would not only fail
to defuse the present crisis but also create complications for the
region.
</P>
<P>
According to the Iranian official news agency IRNA, Khatami
made the remark at a meeting with visiting Turkish Deputy Foreign
Minister Kurkma Haktanir.
</P>
<P>
Khatami called on the countries which are interested in peace
in Iraq to concentrate all their efforts in preventing a human
catastrophe and inflicting severe injuries to the Iraqi people,
also expressing hope that Iraq will immediately comply with the
the U.N. Security Council resolutions.
</P>
<P>
He stressed that any change in the demarcation of geopolitical
division in the region is unacceptable to both Turkey and Iran,
noting that it is of great significance that the Islamic and
regional nations endeavor to resolve difficulties through
coordination and cooperation.
</P>
<P>
The Iranian president expressed hope that the efforts of the
U.N. Secretary General Kofi Annan will achieve good results.
</P>
<P>
Iranian Foreign Minister Kamal Kharrazi Thursday urged Annan
to visit Baghdad in order to find a political solution to the
Iraqi crisis and to avert a U.S. military strike on Iraq.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. has threatened to attack Iraq if it does not grant
U.N. weapons inspectors unfettered and unconditional entry to
sensitive places in Iraq in search of weapons of mass destruction
and the means to produce them.
</P>
<P>
Khatami also expressed concern that "Israeli is trying to
foment disunity among the regional countries," noting that Iran
and Turkey should promote their cooperation.
</P>
<P>
Iran has expressed strong opposition to Turkish military
cooperation with Israel after Ankara and Tel Aviv signed a
military cooperation accord.
</P>
<P>
Khatami said the broadening of ties between the two nations
should be based on the axis of stability and progress and
advancement for the region.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Haktanir said that the ongoing Iraqi crisis is
certainly not in the benefit of the regional countries and a
military attack on Iraq will cause irreparable destruction to
that country and its neighbors.
</P>
<P>
He also stated that the territorial integrity of Iraq must be
preserved and this issue is vital to Turkey, adding that Turkey is
interested in closely cooperating with Iran in order to defuse the
current Iraqi crisis.
</P>
<P>
He said the solution to the crisis is dependent upon the
efforts of the regional countries.
</P>
<P>
The Turkish official arrived here Saturday to deliver a
message from the Turkish President Suleyman Demirel. However, no
content of Demirel's message to Khatami was revealed.
</P>
<P>
It was believed that the objective of the Haktanir's visit
to Iran was to exchange views with Iranian officials over
the Iraqi crisis and bilateral relations.

<HEADLINE> Clinton Proposes Anti-Drug Strategy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, February 14 (Xinhua) -- U.S. President Bill
Clinton, in his radio address Saturday, put forward plans to
reduce illegal drug use by 50 percent in the next decade.
</P>
<P>
Clinton said although the number of Americans using drugs has
fallen by 50 percent since 1979, it should be cut in half again
over the next decade.
</P>
<P>
Clinton stressed that the fight against drugs "must be waged
and won at kitchen tables all across America."
</P>
<P>
"Even the world's most thorough anti-drug strategy won't ever
do the job unless all of us pass on the same clear and simple
message to our children: Drugs are wrong, drugs are dangerous, and
drugs can kill you," Clinton said.
</P>
<P>
His plan includes expanded prevention education, employment of
an additional 1,000 Border Patrol officers and 100 Drug
Enforcement Administration agents, completion of the hiring of
100,000 new community police officers and expanded drug testing
and treatment among prisoners and parolees.
</P>
<P>
In a follow-up news conference, McCaffrey said the government
alone cannot solve the national drug problem.
</P>
<P>
"We look forward to working with the Congress, state and local
government and the private sector to forge a bipartisan and truly
national response to the drug problem," McCaffrey said.
</P>
<P>
However, in the Republican weekly address, Speaker Newt
Gingrich of the House of Representatives, accused the president of
neglecting the narcotics issue for five years, and as a
consequence allowing drug use among teen-agers to rise by 70
percent over that period.
</P>
<P>
He criticized Clinton's new drug-fighting schedule for being
too long.
</P>
<P>
Gingrich said the Republican-run Congress would pass their
anti-drug legislation that includes, helping communities build
anti-drug coalitions, giving parents anti-drug information,
providing market incentives so businesses will create drug-free
workplaces and establishing a national clearinghouse for anti-drug
information.

<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, February 15 (Xinhua) -- The Hong Kong Airport
Authority Sunday conducted its second operational readiness trial
in the passenger terminal at the new Hong Kong International
Airport, which is scheduled to open on July 6.
</P>
<P>
The exercise simulated passenger and baggage flows through key
parts of the terminal such as passenger check-in, baggage
handling, immigration and customs, security screening and
information signage to and from the aircraft boarding gates.
</P>
<P>
The trial was almost twice as many as the first one on January
18, involving more than 1,000 volunteers and personnel from
government departments, six airlines and the new airport
community, as well as members of societies for the physically
disabled.
</P>
<P>
Representatives of business partners and the government also
acted as independent monitors for the Authority.
</P>
<P>
Most of the passenger terminal was used for Sunday's trial,
allowing for a far more extensive testing of facilities and
services.
</P>
<P>
Airport Management Director Chern Heed said: "we were pleased
with today's exercise which identified some areas where
operational enhancements can be made," adding: "we also welcomed
the chance to test a larger area of the terminal, and more of its
systems, including those for passengers with special needs. The
trial proceeded as expected, and showed we are on track for
airport opening on July 6."

<HEADLINE> Nouri Calls for Carrying out Fatwa on Rushdie </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, February 15 (Xinhua) -- An hardline Iranian leader on
Sunday called for execution of the death sentence on the British
writer Salman Rushdie, in order "to teach a lesson to those who
oppose god and the divine prophets."
</P>
<P>
Majlis (parliament) Speaker Ali Akbar Nateq-Nouri said at a
opening session of the legislature that "Rushdie sacrileged the
holy sanctities and prophets, especially (the Islamic) Prophet
Mohammad."
</P>
<P>
The words came on the ninth anniversary of the issuance of the
fatwa (religious ordinance) by late Iranian supreme leader
Ayatollah Musavi Khomeini.
</P>
<P>
Rushdie was condemned to death in 1989 by Khomeini for his
controversial novel "the Satanic Verses," which was regarded
blasphemous to Islam. Since then, the Rushdie issue has remained
one of the major obstacles to Iran's relations with European Union
(EU).
</P>
<P>
During the past years, the Iranian government announced it
would not dispatch commandos to kill Rushdie, but refused to offer
written assurance as the EU demanded.
</P>
<P>
The Islamic Republic News Agency (IRNA) quoted Nouri as saying
that Khomeini issued the verdict according to religious and
Islamic principles, and the Shiite and Sunni Muslims have endorsed
the fatwa and considered it "a divine order."
</P>
<P>
Nouri stressed that the Rushdie affair was a case of insulting
the Almighty and prophets. He criticized the west of "making a
ballyhoo under the pretext of protecting human rights and
portraying those supporting the fatwa as terrorists."
</P>
<P>
Iranian Foreign Ministry spokesman Mahmoud Mohammadi Saturday
also blamed British Foreign Secretary Rabin Cook for calling on
Iran to cancel Khomeini's fatwa.
</P>
<P>
The spokesman said the death fatwa "is irrevocable and will
remain in history."

</P>
<P>
Wanda, winners of Chinese First Division League, tied with
Antlers and Pohand, who trounced Finance and Revenue of Burma 5-1,

</P>
<P>
Pohand top the overall standings with six points and the most
goals of eight, one more than second Wanda. Finance lost all the
three matches.
</P>
<P>
The Japanese team opened scoring in the 50th minute after a
goalless first half, but Wanda equllized on goal from Li Ming in
the 69th minute.
</P>
<P>
Antlers scored the winning ball in the 81st minute, taking
advantage of a mistake by a Chinese defender.
</P>
<P>
Finance scored the equalizer shortly after they came back from
the break, but could not hold on when Lee Dong-gook, Sergei
Konovalov and Park Tae-ha found the net four times.

<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, February 15 (Xinhua) -- Southern African governments
and non-governmental organisations in the region should take the
lead in implementing United Nations standard rules for disabled
people.
</P>
<P>
The appeal was made by secretary-general of the Southern
Africa Federation of the Disabled People Alexander Phiri at a
regional seminar to review U.N. standard rules for the disabled
organised by the African Rehabilitation Institute which ended in
Harare at the weekend.
</P>
<P>
Phiri noted that there was general lack of motivation among
governments and NGOS to incorporate disability issues into
sectoral development systems and commit resources to support
them.
</P>
<P>
Phiri also blamed disabled people's organisations for the
situation since they tended to operate in isolation from other
stakeholders.
</P>
<P>
"The disability movement is largely to blame for this lack of
NGOS' involvement. We are not keen to link up our activities
with other stakeholders and so our influence may be limited," he
said.
</P>
<P>
There was need, he added, for partnerships with government
agencies, donors and NGOS to make disability issues a consistent
part of national, regional and international development agendas.

<HEADLINE> Malaysia Seeks to Improve APEC's Management </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUALA LUMPUR, February 15 (Xinhua) -- Malaysia said Sunday it
would seek the views of Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC)
members at the forthcoming APEC Senior Officials Meeting (SOM) on
further improving and rationalizing the APEC's management process.
</P>
<P>
This is to ensure better integration of APEC's activities and
efficient resource allocation, given the limited resources of
members and the changing circumstances and priorities, SOM
chairman Abdul Razak Haji Ramli said in Pulau Pinang where the
two-day Senior Officials meeting will begin on Monday.
</P>
<P>
APEC started reviewing its organizational structure and
managerial practices in 1996 and followed through in 1997.
</P>
<P>
"Malaysia will seek to carry this task further to ensure that
the structure and managerial practices remain focused," he was
quoted by official media reports here as telling reporters.
</P>
<P>
Malaysia, which chairs APEC this year, would discuss this
process with New Zealand and Brunei which would take over the APEC
chair in 1999 and 2000 respectively, the official said.
</P>
<P>
He said APEC's activities last year stressed implementation and
results and this year, Malaysia would concentrate on "capacity
building".
</P>
<P>
Malaysia would like to get APEC more focused on priorities in
certain areas to realign its structure, to be efficient and not to
have too many meetings, he said.
</P>
<P>
The SOM to be followed by other committee meetings is being
attended by some 400 delegates from 18 APEC members and three
members-designate -- Peru, Russia and Vietnam -- who will observe
the meeting before eventual entry, expected to be in November
this year.

<HEADLINE> Hussein: Annan's Visit to Iraq Much Expected </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
AMMAN, February 14 (Xinhua) -- King Hussein of Jordan told
U.N. chief Kofi Annan Sunday that the people in the region were
expecting him to visit Baghdad and defuse the current
Iraq-U.N. standoff over weapons inspection.
</P>
<P>
In a telephone call to Annan, Hussein stressed the necessity of
dialog between the concerned parties to solve all the outstanding
issues.
</P>
<P>
Annan's visit "hopefully will lead to positive results that
save Iraq and the region from the negative repercussions of the
military choice," the king said in a statement issued after
calling Annan.
</P>
<P>
The king also emphasized to the secretary general the
necessity of Iraqi compliance with the U.N. Security Council's
resolutions so that the sanctions on Iraq could be lifted and the
sufferings of the Iraqi people ended.
</P>
<P>
The crippling sanctions were imposed on Iraq following its
invasion of Kuwait in 1990. They can only be lifted when
U.N. inspectors certify that Iraq is free of weapons of mass
destruction.
</P>
<P>
Hussein also expressed his appreciation of the efforts exerted
by the U.N. to defuse the crisis through diplomatic means.
</P>
<P>
Iraq has barred U.N. inspectors from searching some places,
citing national sovereignty. In response, the United States
threatened use of force.
</P>
<P>
As an Iraqi proposal to open eight sites under certain
conditions was immediately rejected on Wednesday by the U.S., a
new round of international efforts headed by the U.N. was drummed
up to help solve the crisis.
</P>
<P>
Annan declared Friday that he had begun to make preparations to
pay a visit to Baghdad soon.
</P>
<P>
The U.N. mediation comes after the efforts made by Russia,
France and the Arab League, whose initiatives gave birth to
Iraq's Wednesday proposal.

<HEADLINE> Re-Employment Crucial To Success in Enterprise Reforms: Zhu Rongji </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TIANJIN, February 15 (Xinhua) -- Vice-Premier Zhu Rongji,
during a visit to this major industrial center and port in
northern China, emphasised the importance of getting workers who
lost their jobs at state-run enterprises back to work because they
are vital to the success in the enterprise reforms.
</P>
<P>
Whether China can reach its goal of helping get most
money-losing state enterprises out of difficulties by the year
2000 depends on this, Zhu said during a visit yesterday to several
enterprises and neighbourhood communities where he talked with
workers who had been laid off and listened to reports by local
officials on their employment efforts.
</P>
<P>
Zhu said the situation was inevitable during the transition
from a planned economy to a market one, and pointed to some flaws
in the economy in the early 1990's like duplication of
construction projects, enterprises started without sufficient
funding, and redundant workers in most enterprises.
</P>
<P>
The accumulation of these problems led to an increase in the
number of people laid off over the past two years, and at present
there are about 10 million of these people, he said.
</P>
<P>
The trimming of staff has caused problems for some workers,, he
said, adding that but these difficulties are temporary and the
strategy is fundamentally conducive to China's economic
development and consistent with the long-term interests of the
working class, he said.
</P>
<P>
The government, enterprises, and society should all join hands
to guarantee a basic living standard for these people and to help
them find new jobs, he said, and this is part of the social
security system with Chinese characteristics. Re-employment
centers need to be established and government, enterprises and
social welfare organizations should share the cost equally, Zhu
said.
</P>
<P>
He also called for the establishment of a nationwide computer
network to facilitate the re-employment effort, and then praised
Tianjin for its efforts in getting jobs for the unemployed. The
city has had 320,000 laid-off workers by the end of last year, but
265,000 have found new jobs by now.

<HEADLINE> Mummified Ancient Body to Be Displayed In Shanghai </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHANGHAI, February 15 (Xinhua) -- The mummified body of a male
that is regarded as the best preserved 1,000-year-old body in
China will be on display in the Shanghai Museum this April.
</P>
<P>
The 1.8-meter-long body was found in a group of tombs dating
back 1,800 years at Loulan, an ancient kingdom that existed along
China's Silk Road in the northwestern autonomous region of
Xinjiang.
</P>
<P>
Other items found during the excavation work were glasses,
wooden bowls, copper ware, and textiles, that researchers assume to
be the possessions of a nobleman.
</P>
<P>
The face of the man is not visible because of a mask covering
it. The long silk gown he is wearing is considered one of the most
prominent finds of the excavation because it is intact and of
splendid quality.
</P>
<P>
The display this April will also include some 300 cultural
relics like silk and fur items, paintings, jade, pottery, and food
items, a third of which have the state's highest level of rating
for relics.
</P>
<P>
The exhibition, which is being sponsored by the cultural relics
bureau and archaeology institute of Xinjiang and the Shanghai
Museum, will run for half a year.

<P>
HONG KONG, February 15 (Xinhua) -- The government of the Hong
Kong Special Administrative Region will put up over 25 billion HK
dollars (3.2 billion U.S. dollars) in the next five years to
launch a number of ambitious road project programs.
</P>
<P>
These include the widening of highway and roads in the "New
Territories" and of the Eastern Island Corridor, Nicholas Ng,
secretary for Transport, said at a press briefing here Monday.
</P>
<P>
He said that the government's major road improvement work aims
at "relieving traffic congestion and coping with rapidly
increasing traffic needs."

The government, Ng said, will also be constructing the section
of Route 5 in "New Territories" and is doing studies for the
construction of Route 9 running from Tsing Yi, "New Territories"
to Lai Chi Kok, Kowloon.
</P>
<P>
"We hope to be able to finalize very soon our preliminary study
on the Central Kowloon route linking West Kowloon and Southeast
Kowloon," he said.
</P>
<P>
Ng said the SAR government was also planning to do more in the
future to set out the blueprint for transport infrastructure for
Hong Kong for the coming decades.
</P>
<P>
"For this purpose, we are undertaking the Third Comprehensive
Transport Study to assess the overall transport needs. We are also
embarking on the Second Railway Development Study to map out a
network for a rail system for Hong Kong."
</P>
<P>
The studies are expected to be completed before the end of
1999.

Only when Iraq did this could the crisis be resolved and the
sanctions against the Arab nation be lifted, the statement said.

<P>
It is also the condition for the economic cooperation between
Bulgaria and Iraq to be continued, it added.
</P>
<P>
The statement also expressed optimism that with the concerted
effort of the international community, Iraq will be persuaded to
comply eventually and thus averting war threats in the region.

<HEADLINE> China to Improve Quality of Police Force </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, February 15 (Xinhua) -- A senior Chinese police
officer has said that it is only empty talk to speak of
safeguarding political stability and social order and promoting
the rule of law if the basic quality of the national police force
is not up to the new task.
</P>
<P>
Zhu Chunlin, head of the Public Security Ministry's Political
Department, made the statement in a recent interview with Xinhua.
</P>
<P>
Zhu said that a new appraisal system went into effect on
January 1, this year, and is expected to improve the quality of
the Chinese police, and that it is only by adhering to this
principle that the Ministry, which is an important law-enforcement
department, can really promote the rule of law, and to do so it
must establish a highly competent national police force.
</P>
<P>
In recent years, public security bureaus have made an effort to
improve the quality of the police, but China's socialist democracy
and legal system demand a more competent national police force.
</P>
<P>
This, Zhu calls an urgent project and a key part of public
security work.
</P>
<P>
Early in 1994, Tao Siju, the Public Security minister, said
that the Chinese police should have to pass tests and have their
professional and physical ability appraised, and that those who
fail the test should attend a training course, and those who fail
the training course should be dismissed.
</P>
<P>
In the first half of 1995, an experiment with tests and an
appraisal system began, and 50,000 police have passed. Beginning
this year, a million police are scheduled for testing and
appraisals.

<TEXT>
<P>
KATHMANDU, February 15 (Xinhua) -- A three-day Himalayan
Eco-regional Cooperation Workshop is to be held in the Nepali
capital city from Monday, said the United Nations Development
Program (UNDP).
</P>
<P>
The workshop will bring together key government officials,
decision makers and international non-governmental organizations
from Nepal, China, India, Pakistan, Bhutan and Myanmar alongside
representatives of some other organizations, the UNDP said.
</P>
<P>
It noted that the six countries are now seriously threatened by
an array of problems stemming from, among others, poverty,
population pressure and global climate change.
</P>
<P>
It said that following an informal session at the Regional
Bureau for Asia and the Pacific of UNDP in December 1996, it was
felt that a follow-up meeting among participants from countries
sharing the Himalayan eco-system should be held in Kathmandu to
discuss biodiversity conservation and explore interest in
cooperative initiatives.
</P>
<P>
The workshop, the first of its kind, aims to build consensus
among the countries on the need for a regional effort to protect
and conserve fragile mountain eco-system and identify and discuss
major gaps, constraints and potential collaboration for effective
conservation and sustainable use in the Himalayas.
</P>
<P>
Besides, the workshop is expected to outline possible
modalities for regional cooperation, formulate a collaborative
plan of action for priority biodiversity conservation and
sustainable use programs in the region, identify and prepare a
range of initial project concepts for implementation in the region
with national, UNDP and other resources, the UNDP said.
</P>
<P>
The World Wildlife Fund and the International Center for
Integrated Mountain Development will provide substantive technical
inputs to the workshop funded by the UNDP.
</P>
<P>

<HEADLINE> News Analysis: Premier Li Peng's Visit to Promote Sino-Russian Ties (1) By Xinhua Diplomatic Writer Zhang Rongdian </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, February 13 (Xinhua) -- Exchange of high-level visits
over the recent years has exerted a strong impact on the
development of the Sino-Russian relations, and Chinese Premier Li
Peng's upcoming visit to Moscow is believed to inject new vigor
into the already strong growth of the Sino-Russian ties.
</P>
<P>
Li's official good-will visit to Moscow, scheduled on February
17-18 at the invitation of his Russian counterpart Viktor
S. Chernomyrdin, fully demonstrates once again that the Chinese
government values very much on developing Sino-Russian relations.
</P>
<P>
Bilateral ties have witnessed rapid and overall growth since
December 1992 when Chinese president Jiang Zemin and Russian
president Boris Yeltsin signed the joint statement on the basis of
bilateral relations, especially since April 1996 when they decided
to establish the Sino-Russia strategic partnership relation of
co-operation.
</P>
<P>
In the past five years, heads of the state of the two countries
held five meetings and their two prime ministers met for four
times, such frequent contacts have been unprecedented in China's
diplomatic history.
</P>
<P>
At the turn of the century when the international situation is
changing and the world is going multi-polarized, it is of great
significance for world leaders to reinforce their communications
and dialogues.
</P>
<P>
This is important for establishing new and improved
international political and economic orders, bringing prosperity
and stability to various countries in the next century, and
deepening the understanding and trust among various countries so
as to get rid of the cold war thinking and build a new type of
nation-to-nation relations.

<TEXT>
<P>
The establishment of a strategic partnership relations of
cooperation between the two countries towards the 21st century has
provided an inspiration for the rest of the countries in the world to
handle their relations, especially for big powers to handle their
relations, and the effort both Chinese and Russian leaders made in
this regard has won world-wide appreciation.
</P>
<P>
The new-type of Sino-Russian relations, built up on the basis
of the Five-Principles of Peaceful Co-existence, is a historical
choice of both sides after summing up historical lessons and
experience over the past decades.
</P>
<P>
Such relations, featuring non-alliance, non-confrontation, and
no direction to any third country, not only conform to the
fundamental interests of the two countries, but also to the
historical trend of seeking peace, stability and progress, and
thus such relations are full of vitality.
</P>
<P>
The fruitful co-operation between China and Russia in politics,
economy, trade, culture, and other fields, as well their good
coordination in world affairs in recent years may serve as a
good illustration.
</P>
<P>
During his coming visit, premier Li Peng will hold the third
regular meeting with his Russian counterpart Chernomyrdin,
exchange views with Russian leaders on further consolidating the
strategic partnership relations of co-operation and expanding
coordination in various spheres. He is also expected to sign some
important documents.
</P>
<P>
It is believed that the Chinese premier's visit to Russia will
surely add new motive force to the development of Sino-Russian
relations.

<HEADLINE> PNA Voices Support to Peaceful Solution of Iraq </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
RAMALLAH, PALESTINE, February 15 (Xinhua) -- The Palestinian
National Authority (PNA) Sunday expressed its strong support to
the peaceful solution of the current Iraq crisis, while calling on
Iraq to comply with U.N. resolutions on arms inspection.
</P>
<P>
The PNA position was officially spelled out for the first time
here by Nabil Shaath, PNA Minister of Planning and International
Cooperation, at a news conference attended by local and foreign
journalists.
</P>
<P>
Referring to the Palestinian acceptance of the peace process
despite all the suffering and unfair treatment by Israel, Shaath
said that the Palestinians believe that peace process was a far
better option to war, not only in resolving the
Israeli-Palestinian dispute but also in resolving the Iraq
crisis.
</P>
<P>
"We would like to see a peace process in Iraq, we would like
to see a peace process that attempts, and hopefully succeeds, to
get Iraq to implement all the (United Nations) Security Council
resolutions in their entirety... to save the Iraqi people from
the horrors of another devastating war," he said.
</P>
<P>
Shaath said the PNA supports the international peace efforts
that are going on to solve the Iraq crisis and believes that such
efforts have a great chance of success.
</P>
<P>
"We would like to proceed, with the Russians, French, Arabs
and Chinese, with every honest attempt to reach a diplomatic
solution, and we think a diplomatic solution is doable, is
feasible and is possible," he said.
</P>
<P>
The Palestinians sided with Iraq during the 1991 Gulf War, and
there still exists strong support to Iraq among the Palestinians
in its standoff with the United States. There have been a series
of Palestinian demonstrations in the territories over the past
weeks, during which protesters burned Israeli and U.S. flags.
</P>
<P>
Reacting to Israeli charges that the PNA supports Iraq's
efforts to acquire weapons of mass destruction, Shaath blasted
Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu for launching a
demonizing campaign against Palestinian people.
</P>
<P>
He said the PNA was consistent and clear in its position
against any efforts, including Israel's, to develop nuclear,
biological and chemical weapons.
</P>
<P>
Shaath confirmed press reports that the PNA had required
assistance from the United States on providing protection kits
and medicines against biological and chemical attacks. But he
clarified that the PNA did this not just out of the consideration
of a possible Iraqi attack but rather because of the fear about
the Israeli threat.
</P>
<P>
On the Israeli-Palestinian peace process, Shaath said the
Iraq crisis, which has deviated the U.S. and international
attention, has added great difficulties to the efforts to break
the deadlock.
</P>
<P>
He strongly denounced Israel's violation of the signed peace
accords and its refusal to abide by all the U.N.
resolutions. Nevertheless, he expressed high optimism about the
success of the Israeli-Palestinian peace process, citing that the
majority of Palestinians and Israelis are still supporting the
process.

<HEADLINE> Health Tax On Tobacco Products Remains Controversial </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, February 15 (Xinhua) -- Authorities of some localities
have taken the first steps in getting their profitable tobacco
industry to pay compensatory damages for smoking-related health
problems in spite of controversy.
</P>
<P>
The Health Department of Gansu Province levied a special tax on
tobacco products earlier this year to raise funds for health
education and disease control that requires cigarette wholesalers
and retailers to hand over 0.4 percent of their annual sales.
</P>
<P>
"The policy will provide more than 14 million yuan annually,
which can be used for health-promotion programs in rural areas and
health education," the department's deputy director, Liang
Shizhang, told Xinhua today.
</P>
<P>
The health departments of Shaanxi and Hubei provinces, and of
Shanghai and Chongqing municipalities have made similar decisions,
but have not put the rules into effect because opposition from the
local tobacco sector is a major obstacle, according to health
officials.
</P>
<P>
"Certainly they don't want us to do it," said Li Xianglong,
director of Chongqing's Health Bureau, "but we'll keep negotiating
with other departments to look for a solution."
</P>
<P>
Tobacco companies produced 1.7 trillion cigarettes in 1996, and
paid 83 billion yuan (10 billion dollars) in taxes to the
government. It has become the leading revenue source in China
since 1987. Developing the tobacco industry is a favorite method
to help the local economy in some poor areas.
</P>
<P>
"Some people worry that an anti-smoking campaign may have a
negative impact on economic development. But in fact, we lose more
than we gain from smoking because it causes illnesses and time
away from work," said a Beijing economist.
</P>
<P>
An official in charge of policy-making in the Health Ministry
said that conditions are not yet ripe to formulate a national
regulation on increased fees from tobacco products. But he praised
the action as a means of killing two birds with one stone.
</P>
<P>
On the one hand it will slow the increase in tobacco sales, and
on the other, it can provide funds for smoking-control campaigns
and health-care costs, according to Cai Renhua, director of the
Ministry's Health Policy and Law Department.
</P>
<P>
There have been almost no cases involving individuals suing
tobacco manufacturers in China for compensation for health
problems.

<HEADLINE> Flamingos Make First Visit to China </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CHANGSHA, February 15 (Xinhua) -- Some bird watchers in central
China got their first glimpse of a flamingo during an unexpected
visit to China.
</P>
<P>
Specialists say that there are six types of flamingo, most of
them found in Europe, Africa, and North America. None has ever
been spotted before in the wild in China.
</P>
<P>
On February 12, some amateur bird watchers at the East Dongting
Lake Nature Reserve in Hunan Province, central China, spotted a
flamingo wading in shallow water, towering over the swans and
mallards nearby.
</P>
<P>
Two of the witnesses were Zhao Xinru, a professor of biology at
Beijing Normal University, and Lei Gang, an employee of the nature
reserve.
</P>
<P>
Deng Xuejian, a biology professor at Hunan Normal University,
said that it was indeed a flamingo after carefully examining some
pictures taken of the bird.
</P>
<P>
The East Dongting Lake Nature Reserve covers 190,000 ha. of
land and is a special environment for waterfowl.
</P>
<P>
Specialists are still looking for an explanation for the
flamingo's rare appearance in the nature reserve.

<HEADLINE> Netanyahu Absolved Responsibility for Failed </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, February 15 (Xinhua) -- A report by the Israeli
committee investigating a botched attempt on a Hamas leader in
Jordan last September absolved Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin
Netanyahu of responsibility for the failure.
</P>
<P>
In its 100-plus page report, which is to be received by
Netanyahu on Monday, the committee said that the upper echelons of
the Israeli intelligence agency Mossad, including its head Danny
Yatom, bear full responsibility for the failed operation, The
Jerusalem Post reported Sunday.
</P>
<P>
The failed attack on Khaled Mashaal, leader of Hamas (Islamic
Resistance Movement), in Amman, Jordan, last September caused huge
damage to Israeli-Jordanian relations.
</P>
<P>
The committee was set up to investigate the incident, in which
two Israeli agents were arrested by Jordanian police and set free
later to exchange for the release of Hamas founder Sheikh Ahmed
Yassin.
</P>
<P>
Describing the planning of the assassination as "negligent" and
"amateurish," the committee slammed all aspects of the affair, from
the ground preparations to the fact that the agents who botched
the job surrendered too quickly.
</P>
<P>
With regard to whether Yatom should be dismissed, the
committee was split and left the issue to Netanyahu to decide. But
the committee was severely critical of "H," code name of Yatom's
unofficial deputy and head of operations. "H" resigned from
Mossad several months ago, the report said.
</P>
<P>
Netanyahu will not make any decision until he reviews the
report, but he had indicated earlier that he does not want to
shake up the Mossad.
</P>
<P>
The report, produced by Israel Airline Chairman Joseph
Ciechanover, Israel Electric Corp. Chairman and former police
Inspector-General Rafi Peled and former Air Force Commander Dan
Tolkovsky, carefully analyzed the decision-making process both
before and after the failed attempt.

<HEADLINE> (Round-up) Postma Wins Speed Skating, Super-G Cancelled </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAGANO, Japan, February 15 (Xinhua) -- Ids Postma sprinted to win
the second gold medal in speed skating for the Netherland on Sunday
when the men's super-G was called off due to bad weather at the 18th
Olympic Winter Games.
</P>
<P>
Postma, in the men's 1,000m event, held off a strong challenge from
Canadian and Japanese skaters to round the rink with a Olympic record
time of one minute and 10.64 seconds.
</P>
<P>
Dutch skaters have been regarded as long-distance powerhouses. "We
are not specialists in distance, but also in sprint," said Postma
after skating.
</P>
<P>
His compatriot Jan Bos was second wit a mere 0.07 seconds behind
and Japanese skater Hiroyasu Shimizu, gold medal winner in the men's
500m event, managed to finish third at a further 0.36 seconds in rear.
</P>
<P>
World record holder Jeremy Wotherspoon of Canada, who determined to
win the gold for his country, gave a under-estimated skating and
finished a far sixth behind the winner at one minute and 11.39
seconds.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile on snow slopes, overnight snow forced the cancellation of
the men's super giant slalom, which was rescheduled for Monday.
</P>
<P>
The race, which was set for Saturday, was postponed to Sunday
because of heavy snow and dense fog.
</P>
<P>
It has been the fifth complete day that Alpine skiing was washed
out by weather, which recalled the world championships in Morioka five
years ago.
</P>
<P>
According to the schedule, there are only two days left for seven
events in Hakuba and the organizers may consider to change the
competitions to other sites.
</P>
<P>
International Ski Federation Secretary General Gian Franko Casper
said that FIS could change rules so that the combined slalom could be
moved to Shiga Kogen if time runs out for the event at Hakuba.
</P>
<P>
He stressed that it is more important to see that all the scheduled
events are completed before the Nagano Winter Games come to a close
next Sunday.
</P>
<P>
In the sport of Alpine skiing, the showpiece of the winter
Olympics, only three events -- men's downhill, men's combined and
women's super-G had been held at the games.
</P>
<P>
Japan had its best day on Sunday when Kazuyoshi Funaki won the
men's 120m ski jumping event with 272.3 points. It was the first gold
medal in the sport for Japan in 26 years. At the Sapporo Winter Games
in 1972, Japanese jumpers had clean sweep of top three places in the
90-meter event.
</P>
<P>
Jani Soinnen of Finland, who won the 90m ski jumping at the games,
was second at 260.8 and another Japanese jumper Masahiko Harada, who
flied 136 meters in his second leap, was third at 258.3.
</P>
<P>
Russian women soldier Galina Koukleva surprisingly won the women's
biathlon 7.5km sprint at 23 minutes and eight minutes.
</P>
<P>
It was the first major title for the Russian, who has involved in
the sport for 14 years.
</P>
<P>
Koukleva, who said she always had problems in shooting, became a
sharpshooter Sunday, missing only one shot from 10 targets.
</P>
<P>
Ursula Disl of German was second at 23:08.7 and her teammate Katrin
Apel finished third in 23:32.4.
</P>
<P>
The two-man bobsleigh came to a stormy end Sunday afternoon when
Italy and Canadian pairs shared the gold medal with identical timing
from four runs.
</P>
<P>
After three runs, Canadian duo Pierre Lueders and Davis Maceachern
held off a hundredth second deficit to catch up with Italian rival
Guenther Huber and Antonio Tartaglia in the fourth run and shared the
gold medal at three minutes and 37.24 seconds.
</P>
<P>
Christoph Langen and Markus Zimmermann of German were third with
0.65 seconds behind.
</P>
<P>
The sport of curling, which made its debut in winter Olympics,
concluded on Sunday, with Canada taking the men's gold and Norway
grabbing the women's crown.
</P>
<P>
In the men's ice hockey championship round, Russia edged Finland
4-3 and Czech Republic trounced Kazakstan 8-2 on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
After nine day competitions, which had been bothered by jinxing
weather, Russia jumped to lead the medal table with six golds. Norway
and Germany were second at five golds each, followed by Canada at
four.

<HEADLINE> Presidential Election Gets Underway in Cyprus </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NICOSIA, February 15 (Xinhua) -- Tens of thousands of Greek
Cypriots Sunday went to polling stations in the
government-controlled southern part of the island to elect the new
president of the Cyprus Republic.
</P>
<P>
Voting among the 446,732 registered Cypriots began at 7:00
a.m. local time (0500 GMT) and people are called to choose between
incumbent President Glafcos Clerides, 78, and former Foreign
Minister, George Iacovou, 60.
</P>
<P>
According to Cyprus' constitution, Greek Cypriots elect the
president and Turkish Cypriots, the vice president, a position
vacant since the Turkish Cypriots withdrew from the government in
the early 1960s.
</P>
<P>
The result of the first round election last Sunday is too close
to call as Iacovou was ahead of Clerides by less than one percent
of the votes.
</P>
<P>
Iacovou, backed by left-wing Progress Party of the Working
People (AKEL) and center-right Democratic Party (DIKO), gained a
marginal lead of 40.66 percent or 160,918 votes.
</P>
<P>
Clerides, supported by the Democratic Rally Party, received
40.05 percent or 158,763 votes.
</P>
<P>
Four out of the five presidential hopefuls, who did not make
it to the second round during last Sunday's elections, announced
this week they would back Clerides' bid for re-election.
</P>
<P>
Voting, which is mandatory, is taking place at 1,023 polling
stations in all five districts of the government controlled areas
of the republic.
</P>
<P>
More than 3,000 police officers are on duty to ensure
everything runs smoothly.
</P>
<P>
Chief Returning Officer Thanos Michael told reporters here
that there have been so far no reports of any incidents at
polling stations.
</P>
<P>
When voting ends at 17:00 p.m. local time (1500 GMT), ballot boxes
will be taken to the local counting centers in each district for
counting.
</P>
<P>
The final result of the vote is expected to be made public
around 23:00 p.m. local time (2100 GMT) and the new president will
be formally announced around midnight.
</P>
<P>
Cyprus, which gained independence from British colonial rule
in 1960, has remained divided into Greek Cypriot-controlled south
and Turkish Cypriot-dominated north since 1974 when Turkey landed
its troops and took over the northern third of the island
following a failed pro-Athens coup in Nicosia.

<HEADLINE> AL Hopes to See Peaceful Solution to Iraq Crisis </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, February 15 (Xinhua) -- Arab League Permanent Delegate
to the United Nations Hussein Hassounah Sunday voiced hope that
the coming few days would witness a peaceful solution to the
U.N.-Iraq standoff over arms inspection.
</P>
<P>
In an interview with Egyptian Voice of Arabs Radio over
telephone from New York, he said the possibility of reaching a
diplomatic solution to the crisis is still standing.
</P>
<P>
The diplomat said the five permanent members of the
U.N. Security Council are actively involved in the current
negotiations with U.N. Secretary General Kofi Annan to avert
further escalation of the tensions, but division regarding Iraq
still exist.
</P>
<P>
"This division exists and several questions are being debated
within the SC," Hassounah said.
</P>
<P>
Russia, France and China have opposed the use of military means
to force Baghdad's compliance with U.N. arms inspectors.
</P>
<P>
The United States, backed by Britain, started its military
build-up in the Gulf region when the current crisis with Iraq over
U.N. arms inspection erupted last October.
</P>
<P>
The crisis was triggered off by Iraq's denial of full access to
U.N. arms inspectors to its presidential sites suspected of hiding
weapons of mass destruction.
</P>
<P>
To avert an imminent war, Annan has sent a technical team to
Iraq to survey Iraq's eight presidential sites that have been
off-limits to the U.N. Special Commission in charge of scrapping
Iraq's weapons of mass destruction.

<HEADLINE> Ousted S. Leone Junta Head Vows to Fight Back </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, February 15 (Xinhua) -- Ousted head of Sierra Leone's
military junta, Johnny Paul Koroma, has prosmised to regain power
by fighting against Nigerian-led west African peacekeeping force
(ECOMOG).
</P>
<P>
This time, his main target will be Nigerians, who "are trying
to destroy our country. They are not ECOMOG," he said, quoted by
press reports Sunday.
</P>
<P>
The ousted junta leader in hide denied complete defeat of his
regime, which seized power in a coup last May, saying "we are
still going to fight back, we have to liberate our land."
</P>
<P>
He said his troops would do it the same way that the Nigerians
did it, thus suggesting that an invasion would be launched from
neighboring Liberia, where part of ECOMOG soldiers entered Sierra
Leone, the reports said.
</P>
<P>
Koroma claimed he was speaking on a satellite telephone from a
hill outside the capital Freetown on Satuday.
</P>
<P>
However, reports quoted ECOMOG intelligence as indicating that
Koroma was hiding with a group of Lebanese and was seeking
political asylum through the Lebanese embassy in Conakry, Guinea.
</P>
<P>
Koroma complained that some members of his junta were being
rounded up and two of them had been killed in what he said was a
measure of revenge.
</P>
<P>
The Nigerian military has said most members of the junta were
arrested when they fled to Liberia two days ago, while it is also
reported that some other members, including finance minister Joe
Amara Bangari, on their way to Guinea were caught by Guinean
security forces on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
Also on Saturday, President Ahmed Tejan Kabbah said in
Conakry, where he has stayed in exile since the coup, he would
soon take effective control of state affairs.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, ECOMOG, which forced into central Freetown Thursday
afternoon after a week-long intense fighting with the junta
troops and allies, have brought more districts of the city under
control.
</P>
<P>
As the mopping up of the entire city and its peninsula is
going on, ECOMOG has imposed an 8:00 p.m. to 6:00 a.m. curfew on
Freetown. To provide urgent aid to an estimated 500,000 starving
civilians trapped by the fighting, the World Food Program (WFP)
has promised to send 580 tons of food to Freetown by Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
It said on Saturday a ship was being loaded in Liberia.
</P>
<P>
"We cannot wait any longer to bring urgently needed food aid
to hundreds of thousands of desperately hungry people in
Freetown," WFP said in a statement.

<HEADLINE> ASEAN Calls for Certainty in Cambodia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, February 15 (Xinhua) -- Foreign ministers of Indonesia,
the Philippines and Thailand Sunday issued a statement, stressing
the need for obtaining "certainty" concerning the political status
of Cambodia's ousted First Prime Minister Norodom Ranariddh.
</P>
<P>
The ministers had held one-day consultations Saturday in Manila
and met here on Sunday with senior officials of the "Friends of
Cambodia", an informal group including the United States, Japan
and European Union countries.
</P>
<P>
Both sides cited the necessity of King Norodom Sihanouk's
return to Cambodia as early as possible, recognizing his
"important role as a unifying force of the Cambodian people."
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Indonesian Foreign Minister Ali Alatas stressed with
his ASEAN fellow ministers that the issue of Ranariddh's
culpability in the trial was the "internal affair" of Phnom Penh
and that the ASEAN (the Association of Southeast Asian Nations)
was not in a position to influence whatever happens to Ranariddh.
</P>
<P>
However, the ministers urged Cambodian Second Prime Minister
Hun Sen to facilitate and accelerate the process that will enable
Prince Ranariddh to meet the legal requirements for participation
freely in the July 26 elections.
</P>
<P>
Philippine Foreign Secretary Domingo Siazon suggested that the
Hun Sen government first try Ranariddh in absentia first and then
have him granted amnesty before the start of election campaigns on
March 20.
</P>
<P>
Siazon and his counterparts said in the statement that they
wanted clarification from Hun Sen of the desirability of ASEAN's
continuing role in the restoration of political stability in
Cambodia.
</P>
<P>
Hun Sen ousted Ranariddh in bloody fighting in June 1997. He
said Ranariddh must stand trial for colluding with the Khmer Rouge
group and illegally importation of weapons.
</P>
<P>
The nine-member ASEAN also includes Brunei, Laos, Myanmar,
Malaysia, Singapore and Vietnam.

<TEXT>
<P>
COLOMBO, February 15 (Xinhua) -- The Sri Lankan authorities
have started to keep a close watch on water levels in
hydroelectric reservoirs as a severe drought continues in the
island country, officials said Sunday.
</P>
<P>
The drought began in early January and experts here said it
could last until May.
</P>
<P>
The government has repeatedly assured that there would be no
power cut this year, unlike in the past.
</P>
<P>
If the situation turns worse, the government could turn to
thermal power plants for electricity generation, the officials
said.
</P>
<P>
The Ceylon Electricity Board (CEB) also assured the public that
they have the capacity to produce about 1,000 giga watt hours
(GWH) of electricity needed for normal consumption.
</P>
<P>
A CEB official said at present water storage in most of the
reservoirs are sufficient to meet the requirements for power
generation.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, according to Deputy Director of Meteorology
Jayatilleke Bandara, a long range weather forecast has shown that
the drought will last till the onset of the South-West monsoon,
which is expected in May.
</P>
<P>
He said the drought is worsened due to the El Nino phenomenon.

<HEADLINE> Large Percentage of Fruits Wasted in Sri Lanka </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
COLOMBO, February 15 (Xinhua) -- About 40 percent of fruits go
waste in Sri Lanka each year, according to a survey conducted by
the Agriculture and Land Ministry recently.
</P>
<P>
Officials of the ministry said Sunday that the survey revealed
that only 58 percent of the country's fruit output were consumed
by Sri Lankans, 2 percent were exported while the remainder were
wasted in various forms.
</P>
<P>
Market experts here said lack of proper storage facilities is
one of the reasons leading to waste.
</P>
<P>
About 50 varieties of fruits are popularly grown on 50,000
hectares of land in the island nation.
</P>
<P>
Annual output of fruits amounts to 640,000 metric tons and the
annual per capita consumption is nearly 22 kilograms in Sri Lanka,
the officials said.
</P>
<P>
They noted that the ministry has taken decisions to improve the
quality of fruits and stop waste.
</P>
<P>
Also, plans have been made to expand fruit export on the world
market.
</P>
<P>
Fruits produced in Sri Lanka is gaining popularity as many
countries are keen to buy chemical-free fruits, the officials
said. Fertilizers and pesticides are not widely used in Sri Lanka.

<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, February 15 (Xinhua) -- Nigeria kicked off the trial of
27 suspects involved in a coup plot discovered last December by a
special military tribunal Saturday in Jos, capital of Plateau
State in the north.
</P>
<P>
Pictures on local newspapers show that the suspects appeared
in the tribunal sitting in a barrack with their hands handcuffed
and their legs in chains.
</P>
<P>
One of the main suspects, Lieutenant-general Oladipo Diya, the
chief of general staff before the coup, said at the court that he
is a victim of a set-up "organized right from the top".
</P>
<P>
He accused the chief of army staff as "the masterminder, the
executioner and planner of the incident".
</P>
<P>
On trial with him are 14 other military officers and 12
civilians, including Major-general Tajudeen Olanrewaju, former
minister of communication and Major-general Abdulkareem Adisa,
former minister of works and housing.
</P>
<P>
The president of the seven-member special military tribunal,
Major-general Victor Malu, commanding officer of the second
mechanized division in Ibadan, promised that the trial will be
fair.
</P>
<P>
Malu, who was only recently the commander of the west African
peace-keeping force (ECOMOG), said Saturday at the court, "we
must all work together to ensure that justice is not delayed and
at the same time it is not hurried to the detriment of any
person."
</P>
<P>
The tribunal is given one month to deliver their judgement.

<HEADLINE> ASEAN, West Support Ranariddh's Return to Cambodia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, February 15 (Xinhua) -- The Association of Southeast
Asian Nations (ASEAN) and 11 western countries Sunday backed a
proposal that would allow ousted first Prime Minister Norodom
Ranariddh to return to Cambodia and participate in the July 26
elections.
</P>
<P>
The western countries, belonging to an informal group known as
"Friends of Cambodia", included the United States, Japan and
European Union nations. They said Cambodian Second Prime Minister
Hun Sen risks losing international assistance for the polls unless
the terms of the Japanese proposal are met.
</P>
<P>
"If the issue of participation (of Ranariddh) is not resolved,
the "Friends of Cambodia" would have to individually review their
continuing assistance for the electoral process," the group said.
</P>
<P>
The group made the warning after its representatives held a
one-day meeting here with foreign ministers of Indonesia, the
Philippines and Thailand, which are tasked to help Cambodia return
to normalcy and prepare for its eventual entry into the
nine-member ASEAN.
</P>
<P>
Japan's proposal, which has been conveyed to Phnom Penh, called
for Ranariddh to abandon any military cooperation with the Khmer
Rouge guerrillas and an immediate ceasefire.
</P>
<P>
It also calls on Phnom Penh to guarantee Ranariddh's security
and safety and to allow him to take part in the elections.
</P>
<P>
Ranariddh was ousted by Hun Sen in bloody street fighting in
Phnom Penh last June. The conflict derailed Cambodia's scheduled
entry to ASEAN last year.
</P>
<P>
Ranariddh, who is in exile, wants to participate in the
elections, but Hun Sen insists that he would stand trial for
allegedly colluding with the Khmer Rouge and illegal importing
weapons.
</P>
<P>
The other members of the ASEAN include Brunei, Laos, Malaysia,
Singapore, Myanmar and Vietnam.

was stemmed from a letter of French Foreign Minister Hubert
Vedrine to his Italian counterpart Lamberto Dini Friday night.
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
NAGANO, Japan, February 15 (Xinhua) -- Ids Postma of the
Netherlands skated to the first Olympic gold medal in the men's
1,000-meter speed skating for his country on Sunday with a new Games
record at the Winter Olympics in Nagano "M-Wave".
</P>
<P>
Postma clocked one minute and 10.64 seconds for his victory,
shattering the previous record of 1:12:43 set by Dan Jansen of the
United States in Lillehammer years gao.
</P>
<P>
His compatriot Jan Bos was timed of 1:10.72 for the silver.
</P>
<P>
"Jan was the star this year but I had good luck today and I was
faster." Postma said. "What with the 1,500-meter silver medal and the
gold today, I am really happy."
</P>
<P>
Japan's Hiroyasu Shimizu, winner of the men's 500 meters last
Tuesday, took the bronze in 1:11.00.
</P>
<P>
The Nagano's golden boy was the only medalist on Sunday to have
competed in the same distance in the Lillehammer Games, where he
finished in 19th place.
</P>
<P>
"I didn't have as good a start as the 500m but it was alright. I
thought I'd try all out to get a world record," Shimizu said.
</P>
<P>
"After my 500 meters victory, I was not so inspired but when I saw
the good results by the Japanese ski jumper this morning I was
inspired to concentrate on the race. I wanted to raise the Japanese
flag gain."
</P>
<P>
Bos, fourth place-finisher in the 1,500m Thursday, was disappointed
with his silver medal, saying "I was a little disappointed but at
least it was still a Netherlands winner."
</P>
<P>
"I will keep on skating for the next four years. Last year I only
dreamed about going to the Olympics and Now I am a silver medalist,"
Bos added.
</P>
<P>
In total, the old Olympic record was surpassed many times by 18
skaters during the race Sunday, with German Peter Adeberg setting the
new record at start in 1:11.90, but it only deserved him ninth place.
</P>
<P>
However the recent world record of 1:10.16 set by Jeremy
Wotherspoon of Canada remained unbroken. Wotherspoon finished in
sixth with a time of 1:11.39 on Sunday.

<HEADLINE> Iran: Death Sentence on Rushdie Irrevocable </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, February 15 (Xinhua) -- An Iranian Foreign Ministry
spokesman has reiterated that the death fatwa on British writer
Salman Rushdie issued by Iranian late supreme leader Ayatollah
Musavi Khomeini "is irrevocable and will remain in the history."
</P>
<P>
Mahmoud Mohammadi said Saturday that the statement concerning
Rushdie made recently by British Foreign Secretary Robin Cook,
current rotatory president of the European Union (EU), has
emanated from his lack of understanding of the Islamic law and
fatwa concepts and was "regrettable," Iranian news agency IRNA
reported.
</P>
<P>
Mohammadi said that "Rushdie issue and his apostasy not only is
Iran's concern, but it is the concern of the entire Muslim world
and that the Organization of the Islamic Conference (OIC) has
confirmed the apostasy of the British author."
</P>
<P>
Khomeini sentenced Rushdie to death in 1989 because of his
controversial novel "the Satanic Verses" which was believed to
have insulted the Islamic sanctities. The British writer has been
forced to live under heavy protection of the British police.
</P>
<P>
The Iranian government has promised not to send commandos to
kill Rushdie but refused to offer written assurance as the EU
demanded.
</P>
<P>
Rushdie's issue has been one of the most sticking problems
hampering the development of relations between Iran and the
European countries.
</P>
<P>
Mohammadi said the Iranian government has already voiced its
principle stand toward the issue and it is surprising that Cook
has asked to negotiate on the matter.

<HEADLINE> Reasons for Railway Overloading Probed </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, February 15 (Xinhua) -- An increased number of people,
most of them rural transient workers, chose train instead of bus
to go back home during the traditional Spring Festival,
overloading many railways in China.
</P>
<P>
About 60 percent of the railways in southwest China, which
carried 6.1 million passengers up to February 11 during the Spring
Festival peak period, were overloaded, according to reports.
</P>
<P>
The string also occurred on railways in east China's Anhui
Province, which carried over one million passengers in less than
half a month before February 12, a rise of 100,000 passengers over
last year's figure.
</P>
<P>
An article on China Youth Daily analyized the reasons behind
the overcrowding.
</P>
<P>
The article believes the rocketing bus fares forced many
low-paid transient workers to choose train instead of bus.
</P>
<P>
For example, a bus fare for travel between Huainan and Hefei,
all in Anhui, rose to 30 yuan (3.61 US dollars) while the train
fare only costs between four to ten yuan.
</P>
<P>
People like train better also because of its better service
over the bus, the article noted.
</P>
<P>
Confronted with intensified competition and decreased
passengers in recent years, railways, owned by the state, have
taken painstaking efforts to improve service.
</P>
<P>
In comparison, a rising number of buses, many operated by
individuals, are found to offer substandard service, increasing
disputes with passengers.
</P>
<P>
For example, rural workers in Fuyang complained that the buses
they took stopped half way of their destination, refusing to go
any further because of inadequate passengers.
</P>
<P>
The poor condition of some buses resulting from reducing
maintenance to save money is also a source of grievances.

<P>
MANILA, February 15 (Xinhua) -- President Fidel Ramos Sunday
congratulated two Filipino badminton players who have broken into
the top 100 in the world rankings released by the London-based
International Badminton Federation.
</P>
<P>
The duo of Melvin Llanes and Ian Piencenaves earned a total of
40.31 points from five tournaments they participated in within a
one-year period ending mid-January 1998 to rank No. 91 in the
men's doubles.
</P>
<P>
In his letter, Ramos launded the two players, saying the "local
badminton community -- albeit the entire nation -- hails your
latest achievement. It no doubt brings much national pride and
honor even as it reflects the Filipino's growing competitiveness
not only in the world of sports but also in the economic and
livelihood game".
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Ramos extended the wishes of First Lady Amelita
Ramos to the two players for "all possible success" in the coming

<HEADLINE> Lebanese Guerrillas Fire Rockets to Northern </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIRUT, February 15 (Xinhua) -- Lebanese guerrillas fired
scores of Katyusha rockets to Israeli northern area of Gallili
Sunday morning, mistakenly wounding at least five Lebanese
civilians, Lebanese radio Voice of the People reported.
</P>
<P>
Some rockets fell on the villages of Shehin and Yareen inside
the western sector of the Israeli-occupied zone in south Lebanon,
leaving five locals wounded and houses destroyed, the radio said.
</P>
<P>
Confirming the report, the Pro-Israeli South Lebanese Army
(SLA) said the wounded, one of whom in serious condition, were
rushed to hospitals.
</P>
<P>
This was the first launch of Katyusha rockets by Lebanese
guerrillas to Israeli territory so far this year.
</P>
<P>
There has been no report on the casualties on the Israeli side
during the attack.
</P>
<P>
An Israeli coordinator in south Lebanon was quoted as saying
that Israeli troops refrained from retaliating the Katyusha attack
so as not to worsen the situation.
</P>
<P>
In a development that could have been linked to the Katyusha
attack, at leave five artillery shells landed on the Lebanese
southern border at 11:30 pm (21:00GMT) Saturday, the radio report
said, quoting U.N. peacekeepers.
</P>
<P>
But the U.N. sources said it was hard to tell in darkness who
fired the shells and on whom the attack was targeted.
</P>
<P>
In 1985, Israel carved out a 1,200-square-kilometer area in
south Lebanon as a buffer zone with the aim to prevent guerrillas
from launching attacks to its northern area.
</P>
<P>
But since then, clashes with the guerrillas who try to oust
Israeli occupied troops from Lebanon have never stopped.

<HEADLINE> S.Lanka AirForce to Send Pilots Abroad for Training </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
COLOMBO, February 15 (Xinhua) -- The Sri Lanka Air Force (SLAF)
is planning to send personnel to India, Pakistan and Bangladesh
for flight training, SLAF officials said Sunday.
</P>
<P>
Only a small number of pilots are trained in Sri Lanka each
year due to a lack of training facilities, the officials said.
</P>
<P>
The Air Force has around 160 pilots at present, compared with
65 three years ago.
</P>
<P>
It needs more pilots as the service is undergoing expansion by
taking in more fighter jets, helicopters and transport planes.
</P>
<P>
The shortage of pilots has also become acute after the Air
Force lost several experienced pilots in military actions against
the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam (LTTE) in the north of the
country. At least 19 SLAF aircraft were lost in the past two and a
half years.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the SLAF is making efforts to obtain more
helicopters to provide more adequate air support for troops in the
north. Only three Mi-24 choppers are now available in the northern
ground-air operations against the LTTE.
</P>
<P>
Fighter jets of the Air Force are not used in the operations
because the war-zones are covered with thick jungles.
</P>
<P>
The war between the LTTE and government troops has been going
on in the north and east of Sri Lanka for more than 14 years.

<HEADLINE> UN Technical Team Arrives in Iraq </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BAGHDAD, February 15 (Xinhua) -- A technical team sent by
U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan arrived here Sunday to discuss
ways of inspections to Iraqi presidential sites, the Iraqi News
Agency reported.
</P>
<P>
The team, headed by Staffan de Mistura of Sweden, director of
the U.N. Information Center in Rome and former U.N. Humanitarian
Coordinator for Iraq, includes two Austrian surveyors to Iraq.
</P>
<P>
The decision to send a technical team to Baghdad was made
after Annan met with representatives of the permanent members of
the U.N. Security Council Friday afternoon and discussed ways of
resolving the current crisis over U.N. weapons inspections in
Iraq.
</P>
<P>
The technical team will define the maps of eight Iraqi
presidential sites containing palaces for which Iraqi authorities
requested special inspection arrangements.
</P>
<P>
The team is expected to conclude its task within three or four
days at Annan's request.
</P>
<P>
Iraqi President Saddam Hussein Saturday evening chaired a
meeting of the ruling Revolution Command Council to discuss the
latest development of the current crisis over arms inspection.
</P>
<P>
The United States and Britain have rejected the Iraqi
proposal of conditional inspection of its presidential sites,
insisting that Iraq must grant U.N. arms inspectors unfettered and
unconditional access to those sites.

<TEXT>
<P>
SHANGHAI, February 15 (Xinhua) -- Chen Jihong, a senior citizen
from east China's Shanghai Municipality, crossed over the 6,000
meter high Tanggula Range and spent over one week for a
sight-seeing tour in Lhasa and Xigaze in southwest China's Tibet
Autonomous Region last July at the age of 81.
</P>
<P>
Cheng wrote travel notes containing 10,000 Chinese characters
after his return to Shanghai.
</P>
<P>
However, he is not the only senior citizen in Shanghai who
loves to travel across the country nowadays.
</P>
<P>
On every Friday, over 100 senior people usually gather in a tea
house in the city's Nanshi District and talk about what they saw
and experienced in their traveling tours.
</P>
<P>
These people are all members of Shanghai Nanshi District's
Travellers Association, the country's first non-governmental
travelling organizations which was established a decade ago.
</P>
<P>
Members of the association, most have retired, include over 700
Shanghai landers and many from other cities.
</P>
<P>
The association has its own publication and holds regular tea
parties. It has organized numerous travel tours over the past ten
years.
</P>
<P>
Shanghai now has over 2.3 million citizens of or over the age
of 60, accounting for 18.2 percent of the city's total.
</P>
<P>
With the improvement of their living conditions and increase in
income, many retired people in Shanghai have chosen to amuse
themselves by travelling across the country.
</P>
<P>
To meet their needs in this regard, Shanghai Hengshan Travel
Company opened Shanghai's only travel service specially for senior
citizens in 1994. So far, the company has organized some 10,000
old people to visit scenic spots and cultural relics in the
country.

<TEXT>
<P>
KUWAIT CITY, February 15 (Xinhua) -- Kuwait has massed troops
near its northern border with Iraq in preparation for repelling
any possible Iraqi retaliatory attack as the threatened
U.S. military strike against Iraq draws near.
</P>
<P>
Kuwaiti forces are deployed jointly along the northern border
regions with 1,500 U.S. troops, local newspaper Arab Times Sunday
quoted military sources as saying.
</P>
<P>
Batteries of U.S.-made Patriot missiles have also been deployed
on Kuwaiti islands near Iraq and around oil and industrial
installations, the sources said.
</P>
<P>
Kuwait has already placed its 16,000 armed forces on high
alert, mobilized its 24,000 reserve forces and is preparing to
start receiving 3,000 more U.S. marines troops Sunday.
</P>
<P>
Kuwait has been tied with the U.S. by a defense agreement
since 1991 following the Gulf War and hosts 1,500 permanent
U.S. troops. Six U.S. F-117A stealth fighter bombers have been
deployed in the country since last November and six more are
expected to arrive in Kuwait in a few days.
</P>
<P>
U.S. Air Force Chief of Staff Michael Ryan paid a short visit
to Kuwait Saturday to hold talks with senior Kuwaiti army
officers on military preparations and visited Kuwaiti air bases
where the U.S. stealth fighters are deployed.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. started its military build-up in the region when the
current crisis with Iraq over the U.N. arms inspections erupted
last October. Britain joined the United States to mass military
forces in the Gulf region in preparation for the threatened
military strike against Iraq. It has deployed eight ground-attack
Tornado jets in Kuwait and one aircraft carrier in the Gulf.
</P>
<P>
The sources were quoted as saying that the U.S. military
build-up in the region will be completed by the middle of this
week, and that the strike will be launched on February 20-28 if
diplomatic efforts fail.
</P>
<P>
They said that the United States and its allies have given an
ultimatum until February 20 for diplomatic efforts to succeed.
</P>
<P>
In the Gulf, Kuwait and Bahrain publicly expressed their
support to the U.S. position while others have taken a cautious
attitude publicly. But all expressed their wishes to reach a
solution through diplomatic means.

<HEADLINE> Saudi Arabia Supports Diplomatic </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUWAIT CITY, February 15 (Xinhua) -- Saudi Arabia has
reaffirmed its position for diplomatic efforts to convince Iraq to
comply with the UN resolutions on disarmament in order to avoid a
military strike, according to reports from Saudi Capital Riyadh
reaching here Sunday.
</P>
<P>
Saudi Defense Minister Prince Sultan Ibin Abdul-Aziz said
Saturday night he was still optimistic of finding a peaceful
solution to the current stand-off between Iraq and UN over the
arms inspection operations in Iraq, reported Kuwait News Agency
(Kuna).
</P>
<P>
He was quoted as telling reporters that "I am deeply hoping
that the concerned authorities (Security Council) would reach an
agreement with the government of Baghdad."
</P>
<P>
Saudi Arabia announced on several occasions that it favors a
diplomatic solution of the crisis as the first option and urged
Baghdad to comply fully with all UN resolutions. It also warned
Iraq of grave consequences if diplomatic efforts fail to bring any
results.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. has threatened a military strike against Iraq unless
it allows unconditional and unfettered access of UN arms
inspectors to all sites suspected of hiding banned weapons. A
military build-up for the strike will be completed in a few days.
</P>
<P>
The prince reaffirmed his country's refusal to allow the
U.S. troops use his country's bases in any military strikes
against Iraq.
</P>
<P>
"The question (of using) Saudi military bases and facilities
is rejected in form and substance," Prince Sultan said when
asked about the possibility of Washington using them to launch
the strike against Iraq, Kuna said.
</P>
<P>
Saudi Arabia categorically refused the U.S. request to use
Saudi bases to strike Iraq in 1996 when the U.S. threatened to
attack Iraq for Iraqi troops incursion into the UN protected safe
haven for the Kurds in northern Iraq.
</P>
<P>
Saudi Arabia hosts about 4,000 American troops and about 100
American aircraft.
</P>
<P>
So far the U.S. and Britain have amassed a fleet of 17
warships including three aircraft carriers and about 400 aircraft
in the Gulf region in preparation to launch a strike against Iraq
in case the U.S. demand for unconditional and unrestricted UN arms
inspection in Iraq is not met.
</P>
<P>
Prince Sultan reiterated his country's support for the UN
Security Council resolutions and called on the Iraqi leadership to
abide by these resolutions.

<HEADLINE> S. Africa Considers Banning Smoking in Public </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, February 15 (Xinhua) -- South African Health
Minister Nkosazana Zuma is considering banning smoking in public
and the workplace to protect children and non-smokers, local
daily Sunday Times reported.
</P>
<P>
Zuma is also throwing her influence on a ban on all cigarette
advertizing. She said earlier that she would amend the Tobacco
Products Control Act at this parliamentary session to further
protect public health.
</P>
<P>
The main thrust to legislative changes would be to protect
children. Steps had to be taken to prevent them from being
"bombarded" with pro-smoking messages, Zuma said.
</P>
<P>
She urged the public to get involved, saying the debate on
tobacco controls should be stimulated by the media and other
sectors.
</P>
<P>
Zuma's anti-smoking sentiments have put the multibillion-Rand
Tobacco industry on its guard.
</P>
<P>
South Africans smoke about 25 billion cigarettes annually,
generating an estimated three billion Rand (600 million U.S.
dollars) in taxes.
</P>
<P>
Last year, Minister of Finance Trevor Manuel imposed a 52
percent tax on cigarettes. It was reported that smokers would
possibly to be forced to cough up even more when a new year
budget was to be announced on March 12, if Zuma had her way.

NANJING, February 15 (Xinhua) -- East China's Jiangsu Province
speeded up its pace in building communications infrastructure,
with a record 10.9 billion yuan invested in the sector last year.
</P>
<P>
In 1997, the province newly completed a 29 km expressway

In the meantime, the construction of the Jiangyin Yangtze River
Highway Bridge is proceeding smoothly. Moreover, the province
started to build the Second Nanjing Yangtze River Bridge, the
Xinshu river Expressway Bridge, and two expressways.
</P>
<P>
Last year, the province made new progress in using overseas
funds to build infrastructure. The Jiangsu Shanghai-Nanjing

<HEADLINE> Nearly 10 Percent of Mine Workers Lose Jobs in </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, February 15 (Xinhua) -- About 5,000 people, nearly 10
percent of the total mining labour force in Zimbabwe, have been
retrenched as various mines closed over the last six months, The
Sunday Mail reported Sunday.
</P>
<P>
Chief executive of the Chamber of Mines Derek Bain told the
paper that more people were set to lose their jobs as most mines,
hard-hit by the prevailing low prices on the world market and
high operating costs, downsized their operations.
</P>
<P>
"We will see more mines closing this year. An improvement in
prices would obviously help but operating costs are also a major
problem. The retrenchment of labour on the latter part of last
year and the beginning of this year has affected about 5,000
people, nearly 10 percent of our labour force," he said.
</P>
<P>
Prices of almost all metals except platinum had slumped to
terrible lows on the world market. In addition to the drop in
the world prices, there had been some reduction in demand, for
example, asbestos, where demand had fallen to an all time low
over the last few months. The worst affected had been chrome
mining. Dumping of raw materials on the market had led to the
slump in prices while gold had been affected by speculative
buying, he said.
</P>
<P>
"There is no sign, at this stage, of an upturn in world prices
and regrettably we have to anticipate a lot of increase --
increases in fuel prices being the first, power another one and
wages being the third. We are also being subjected to increasing
heavy duties on our capital equipment," Bain said.
</P>
<P>
This grim situation had forced most companies to downsize or
restructure their operations leading to a significant
retrenchment of labour. Some had either closed down or been
forced into liquidation, also throwing thousands of people onto
the streets, he said.

increased fabric prices from mills and rising input costs, The
Sunday Mail reported Sunday.
</P>
<P>
The increases are up to 156 percent on the January 1997 prices
in some instances, forcing parents whose children enrolled with
most urban secondary schools spending as much as 4,000 Zimbabwean
dollars (about 210 U.S. dollars) on uniforms alone for the
current school term.
</P>
<P>
The Consumer Council of Zimbabwe said, "buying school uniforms
has become a nightmare" as confirmded by its recent survey on
school uniform prices.
</P>
<P>
Senior reseach officer of the council Bright Mpofu said
parents, particularly those whose children attended boarding
schools, expressed concern at the exorbitant prices of school
uniforms.
</P>
<P>
He said, "coupled with escalating schools fees, the average
man is having difficulties, forcing some parents to stop their
children from going to school."

<HEADLINE> Business Booms for China's Arbitrators </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, February 15 (Xinhua) -- Increasingly exuberant
business contacts between China and foreign countries have brought
large numbers of commercial disputes in their wake, said today's
China Daily (Business Weekly).
</P>
<P>
The China International Economic and Trade Arbitration
Commission (CIETAC) has become the biggest arbitration body in the
Far East, measured either in the number of cases it deals with or
the amount of money involved, according to CIETAC Secretary
General Zhu Jianlin.
</P>
<P>
In 1997, CIETAC accepted 723 cases -- the largest number in the
world -- in which about 8.1 billion yuan (975 million US dollars)
was involved.
</P>
<P>
Foreign parties concerned in these arbitration cases came from
45 countries, among which the United States took the lead with 66
cases, followed by 36 cases involving South Korean companies and
30 involving firms from Japan.
</P>
<P>
Cases involving foreign-invested ventures in China accounted
for 29.18 percent of the total.
</P>
<P>
Zhu attributed the explosion of cases partly to the lack of
sophistication of China's foreign trade companies that were
burgeoning in those years.
</P>
<P>
Compared with other ways of settling disputes, arbitration
boasts many advantages such as the stronger voice in
decision-making accorded to the parties concerned, the authority
of the arbitrator's judgement, and the non-public case hearing and
adjudication to protect the parties' reputations and business
secrets.
</P>
<P>
A still more noteworthy advantage of arbitration, in comparison
with court judgements, "lies with the international
acknowledgement of arbitration results," Zhu said.

<HEADLINE> US Religious Leaders Visit Beijing Churches </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, February 15 (Xinhua) -- Three United States religious
leaders spoke about hope, unity and gladness as they visited two
Christian churches in Beijing this morning.
</P>
<P>
"Though we are from different cultures and different countries,
we are united in one pride," President of the National Association
of Evangelicals Rev. Don Argue said in a 15-minute sermon at the
crowded Chongwenmen Church in downtown Beijing.
</P>
<P>
He brought greetings from all evangelics in the US to the crowd
at the church, where Billy Graham preached sermons twice.
</P>
<P>
"Though we are not physically related, I am glad that we are
spiritually related," he said.
</P>
<P>
Argue preached about the Book of Matthew, chapter six, verse
19-24 through an interpreter. The crowd listened quietly and said
"amen" several times during his sermon, though they did not find
the translation a perfect match with their Chinese version of the
Bible.
</P>
<P>
"We are very honored to have the opportunity to pray and sing
with you. Thank you very much. God bless you," he said before
leaving the rostrum with a big smile.
</P>
<P>
Rev. Argue, Rabbi Arthur Schneier, president of the Appeal of
Conscience Foundation, and Archbishop Theodore McCarrick of the
Newark Roman Catholic Archdiocese then joined the crowd to listen
to a sermon by pastor Wu Wei of the church. The American visitors
wore headphones for translation when they prayed and sang with
Chinese and western people in the church.
</P>
<P>
The 104-year-old church is the largest Christian church in
Beijing.
</P>
<P>
Before going to the Chongwenmen Church, the American religious
leaders visited the Cathedral of Immaculate Conception of Blessed
Virgin Mary, also in downtown Beijing.
</P>
<P>
They attended a mass at the Cathedral and met with Fu Tieshan,
vice-chairman of the Chinese Patriotic Catholic Association.
</P>
<P>
"We are good friends. We have been sitting in the same seats
for many times before," Archbishop McCarrick said while holding
Fu's hand in a meeting room in the back of the Cathedral.
</P>
<P>
Archbishop McCarrick said that he is glad to see many young
faces in the Cathedral.
</P>
<P>
"I am especially glad to see a young priest with an Oxford
accent at the mass," he said, referring to Father Peter Jianmin
Zhao who gave the mass.
</P>
<P>
"The alter boys are lovely," he said.
</P>
<P>
He said that young boys represent continuity and life of faith
and should be proud of.
</P>
<P>
Before leaving the Cathedral, the American guests wrote
inscriptions on a log book. Rabbi's inscription is: "May you go
from strength to strength."
</P>
<P>
The American religious leaders said that they regret not having
enough time to visit seminaries in Beijing and that they will come
back again.
</P>
<P>
They plan to visit Nanjing, Shanghai and Chengdu cities in the
next week. They are scheduled to leave Beijing for Nanjing this
afternoon.
</P>
<P>
They canceled a scheduled visit to a Christian church in
Beijing and toured the Great Wall and the Forbidden City on
Saturday.

<HEADLINE> Lusaka Police Reservists Disarmed </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUSAKA, February 15 (Xinhua) -- More than 200 police
reservists in Lusaka, Zambia's capital, have been disarmed after
public outcry over the abuse of guns and increasing robberies at
gunpoint.
</P>
<P>
Sunday Times of Zambia published Sunday said "highly placed
sources" confirmed that the police service has embarked on an
exercise to withdraw firearms from reservists in the capital to
curb alleged misuse.
</P>
<P>
This move came after a killing of three unarmed men by mistake
alledgedly by a night patrol two weeks ago. The three were gunned
down when they helped a police car out of the mud in the road
since the patrol mistook their intention.
</P>
<P>
There has been an outcry from members of the public of late
over the increasing number of guns in the hands of bandits
resulting in the high rate of crime. And guns used in robberries
have in some cases been traced to the police service, said the
government-owned paper.
</P>
<P>
Police sources said arms withdrawal exercise is meant to
prevent reservists from keeeping guns in their homes as the case
is at the moment.
</P>
<P>
They said that the exercise is in conformity with standard
regulations which provided for an officer to use a gun only when
he or she is on duty, but this is not the case because guns have
ended up in the homes of the reservists even when they are off
duty.
</P>
<P>
The disarmament which began last week has just been finished,
said the paper.

LOS ANGELES, February 14 (Xinhua) -- American veteran Andre
Agassi upset second seeded compatriot Michael Chang on Saturday to
enter the final of an ATP men's tennis tournament in San Jose,
California.
</P>
<P>
Agassi defeated Chang 6-4, 7-6 (7-4) to face American world
number one Pete Sampras, who won the other semifinal earlier on
Saturday.
</P>
<P>
Agassi broke Chang in the ninth game of the first set and then
held in the 10th game to close out the set. Chang had a 5-3 lead
in the second set, but Agassi again broke in the ninth game and
held in the 10th.
</P>
<P>
He saved three set points in the 12th game to force the
tiebreaker.

<P>
An ace gave Agassi a 4-3 lead in the decider. Chang then lost

Chang won the next point to stay alive, but sent a service
return long on the next point.

<HEADLINE> S'pore PM To Seek New Base for Closer Cooperation </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SINGAPORE, February 15 (Xinhua) -- Singapore Prime Minister Goh
Chok Tong said that he would try to find a new base to forge
closer cooperation between his country and Malaysia during his
upcoming visit to Kuala Lumpur on Monday, the Sunday Times said.
</P>
<P>
The Sunday Times, the Sunday edition of the Straits Times,
quoted Goh as saying on Saturday that he would go up to Kuala
Lumpur "with a positive outlook. Not to think there are problems
to be solved, but how we can work together."
</P>
<P>
In reply to questions as to what issues would be brought up at
his meetings with Malaysian Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad during
the two-day visit, Goh said he would not want to "approach it on
an issues basis."
</P>
<P>
"It's generally to see whether we can find a new base for us to
forge closer cooperation," he said.
</P>
<P>
"There's a crisis going on, and we've got to try and see how we
can help resolve the regional crisis. That's the main rationale
for my going up. But beyond that, it's always good between
neighbors to see one another from time to time," he added.
</P>
<P>
The two prime ministers have already met twice this year. They
met in Johor, a southern state of Malaysia, on January 20 for 90
minutes and discussed the regional currency crisis and bilateral
relations.
</P>
<P>
They continued these discussions when they met again in
Singapore on February 7, when Mahathir was on a trip to several
ASEAN (Association of Southeast Asian Nations) countries.
</P>
<P>
Goh's upcoming trip to Kuala Lumpur will be his first official
visit to the Malaysian capital since 1994.

<HEADLINE> Bulgarian President on U.S. Visit </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SOFIA, February 14 (Xinhua) -- Bulgarian President Peter
Stoyanov said Saturday that progress has been made in relations
with the United States during his visit to Washington.
</P>
<P>
Stoyanov met with U.S. President Bill Clinton and the two
adopted a joint statement called "U.S.-Bulgarian Partnership for a
New Era" on the initiative of the American side.
</P>
<P>
"This document expresses a new attitude and confidence in
Bulgaria which has embarked on the road to market economy and has
stable and democratic institutions," Stoyanov said.
</P>
<P>
The joint statement assigns Bulgaria a key role in regional
policy, he said.
</P>
<P>
At the talks with his hosts, an emphasis was laid on Bulgaria's
political stability and the opportunities were considered for
transforming this stability into economic capital, he said.
</P>
<P>
To this end, As he put it, Bulgaria should emerge as one of the
hubs of oil and gas transportation and that Crete Corridor
No. VIII (linking the Black Sea with the Adriatic Sea) should be
built.
</P>
<P>
Stoyanov expressed the view that Iraq should be compelled to
comply with the U.N. Security Council resolutions.
</P>
<P>
One of his arguments was that Bulgaria is owed 1,500 million
U.S. dollars by Iraq and could get the money only when that
country implements the resolutions and the trade embargo is
lifted.

<HEADLINE> Myanmar Hoteliers Urged to Attract More Foreign </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
YANGON, February 15 (Xinhua) -- Myanmar Minister for hotels and
Tourism Saw Lwin has urged hotel entrepreneurs and tourism
agencies in the country to attract more foreign tourists in
efforts to maintain Myanmar as a major tourist destination in
Southeast Asia.
</P>
<P>
Meeting with local and foreign tourism entrepreneurs here
Saturday, Saw Lwin said the number of tourist arrivals in Myanmar
is on the rise despite the regional currency crisis which may
hamper the development of the country's tourism industry, The New
Light of Myanmar newspaper reported Sunday.
</P>
<P>
He urged the entrepreneurs to strike a balance between self
interest and others' in doing business.
</P>
<P>
According to official statistics, tourist arrivals in Myanmar
reached 189,428 in the first 10 months of 1997, a four percent
increase over the same period of the previous year.
</P>
<P>
The data also show that foreign investment in Myanmar's hotels
and tourism sector amounted to 763 million U.S. dollars in 39
permitted projects at the end of 1997. Myanmar has drawn a total
of 6.6 billion dollars in foreign investment since the country
opened to the outside world in late 1988.

<HEADLINE> Two Major Thai Cable TV Merges, Leaving 900 Jobless </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, February 15 (Xinhua) -- Two major cable television
networks in Thailand have agreed to merge, but the restructuring
will leave 900 people unemployed, the Nation newspaper reported
Sunday.
</P>
<P>
The agreement between the two competitors -- International
Broadcasting Corp Pls (IBC) and Universal Cable Network Plc (UTV)
-- will be signed Monday, the newspaper said.
</P>
<P>
The deal will be the largest corporate merger in the country
since the financial crisis began last July. The two companies have
been negotiating the merger for about a year.
</P>
<P>
Executives from the two companies confirmed that IBC will buy
into UTV, while UTV in turn, is expected to buy new shares to be
issued by IBC.
</P>
<P>
As a result of the almost 100 percent devaluation of the baht,
which was set floating on July 2 last year, the two firms suffered
heavy losses due to their foreign debts and the increased prices
for imported programs.
</P>
<P>
The combined loss, estimated at six billion baht (130 million
U.S. dollars), will be absorbed by their affiliate companies.
</P>
<P>
UTV claims to have 260,000 subscribers, while IBC has 150,000.

ROME, February 14 (Xinhua) -- Italian Foreign Minister Lamberto

discuss the situation in the Balkans and the prospect
of normalizing relations between Yugoslavia and the international
community.
</P>

discontent with the new government.
</P>

Dini said he hopes Belgrade will continue to play a
constructive role in the region in the run up to the general
election in autumn, which will have a positive impact on the
stability in the Balkans and the implementation of the Dayton
peace accords signed in December 1995.

The Italian minister also called for continuing progress in
economic and political liberatization in Yugoslavia, pointing out

<HEADLINE> S.Lanka Tea Strike Costs Industry US$ 64.5 Million </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
COLOMBO, February 15 (Xinhua) -- The nine-day plantation strike
which ended on Friday has resulted in a loss of four billion
Rupees (64.5 million dollars) in the tea industry, a local expert
said Sunday.
</P>
<P>
Harry Chandrasekara, co-ordinating secretary of the Labor
Dispute Unit of the Ceylon Workers Congress, said work in almost
400 tea factories had come to a standstill since February 5 due to
the strike.
</P>
<P>
He said the trees had to be pruned before tea workers began to
pluck tea leaves, which meant there would be a delay in
production.
</P>
<P>
Trade unions of the strikers on Friday reached a compromise
agreement with the Planters' Federation over a wage hike dispute.
</P>
<P>
The Planters' Federation agreed to pay the workers in the tea
industry a daily wage of 95 Rupees (1.53 U.S. dollars) and a price
share supplement of six Rupees, making the total daily wage rise
to 101 Rupees (1.63 dollars).
</P>
<P>
After Friday's lengthy talks, the trade unions appealed to all
the strikers to return to work from Saturday.
</P>
<P>
However, local press reports Sunday said thousands of estate
workers alleging a sellout by their union leaders staged a fresh
protest Saturday in many parts of tea production areas in Sri
Lanka, casting doubts about the fate of the settlement.
</P>
<P>
The reports said more than 80 percent of the workers didn't
turn up to work Saturday despite the announcement that the strike
was over.
</P>
<P>
The protesters claimed that their union leaders had let them
down by accepting a daily wage of 101 Rupees instead of 105 Rupees
(1.69 dollars) as demanded earlier.
</P>
<P>
The current daily wage for 600,000-strong estate workers in tea
and rubber plantations was 83 Rupees (1.34 dollars).
</P>
<P>
The last strike by estate workers in April 1996, which lasted
for one week, was estimated to have cost the government 500
million Rupees (8.1 million dollars).

BANGKOK, February 15 (Xinhua) -- Enhancing Thailand's image is
more important than seeking financial aid during Prime Minister
Chuan Leekpai's U.S. trip next month, the Bangkok Post reported
Sunday.
</P>
<P>
The newspaper quoted deputy prime minister Supachai
Panitchpakdi as saying that the prime minister does not want to
seek more financial aid, but is more interested in winning the
confidence of the United States.
</P>
<P>
"It is well recognized that during the past three months the
government has managed to solve the economic problems at the
fundamental levels and partly won back confidence, but not yet in
full," Supachai, who is also commerce minister and head of the
government's economic team, said.
</P>
<P>
"We hope the visit will bring more confidence back," he added.
</P>
<P>
Prime Minister Chuan will pay a visit to the United States on
March 10-17 at the invitation of U.S. President Bill Clinton.
</P>
<P>
Supachai, who is to be among the Chuan's entourage, said
Thailand tries to convince the U.S. government and private sectors
that Thailand is steadily recovering from the economic crisis.
</P>
<P>
He said what Thailand wants most is to win back those U.S.
financial institutions which recalled most of the loans from the
Thai private sector last year.
</P>
<P>
He also expressed the hope that the U.S. would open its market
wider to Thailand. "I think the U.S. should stop waging trade war
with us," he said.

<HEADLINE> Bulgaria Expresses Concern over Iraqi Crisis </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SOFIA, February 14 (Xinhua) -- Bulgaria expressed its "mounting
concern" over the U.S.-Iraq standoff Saturday and urged Iraq to
"fully implement" arms inspections by the U.N. Special Commission.
</P>
<P>
"The only way out at this stage is for the Iraqi side to
provide unconditional and unlimited access of the international
inspectors to all installations subject to inspection," the
Foreign Ministry said in a declaration.
</P>
<P>
Bulgaria believes that Iraq should be persuaded to fulfill
strictly the U.N. resolutions which guarantee the peace and
stability in the Middle East, it said.
</P>
<P>
It is the only way to create prerequisites for revocation of
the sanctions against Iraq and for normalization of relations
between the international community and Iraq, according to the
declaration.
</P>
<P>
"It is precisely this normalization that will allow Bulgaria to
regulate its financial and economic relations with Iraq," it said.
</P>
<P>
The United States and Britain have warned Iraq of a possible
military strike if Baghdad does not grant unfettered access to
U.N. inspectors. Iraq has barred inspection of some sites,
including presidential sites, which it said concern national
sovereignty.
</P>
<P>
In anothor development in the Balkan region, Bulgaria's close
neighbor, Romania, vows in a government statement Saturday its
support for military action against Iraq, if efforts for political
solution fail.

<HEADLINE> Sensitive Index Recovering on BSE Last Week </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW DELHI, February 15 (Xinhua) -- After an early retreat, the
sensitive index on the Bombay Stock Exchange (BSE) recovered its
lost ground and posted small gains last week after a weekend sharp
rally in key scrips on heavy purchases by foreign funds and
domestic institutions.
</P>
<P>
The BSE sensitive index, which dropped to 3,292.91 on Wednesday
from last weekend's close of 3,366.70, recovered to end the week
at 3,373.53, netting a gain of 6.83 points.
</P>
<P>
The national index was up at 1,449.23 at the weekend from the
previous weekend close of 1,448.88. The BSE-200 and US dollar
index were quoted marginally down at 320.93 and 137.71 compared
with the previous weekend close of 321.69 and 138.22 respectively.
</P>
<P>
Foreign institutional investors' absence was the main cause for
the initial weakness as operators and financial institutions
preferred to keep away from the market in view of the tension
between Iraq and the United States, and the economic turmoil in
Southeast Asian countries.

<HEADLINE> Transfer of Marcos Money to Philippines Blocked </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, February 15 (Xinhua) -- A last-minute appeal filed by
Marcos family interests delayed the return to the Philippines of
540 million dollars in assets belonging to the late President
Ferdinand Marcos and his widow Imelda Marcos, local press reports
said on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
The reports said foundations set up by the Marcos family filed
the appeal to the Swiss Supreme Court which postponed possibly for
several months the return of the money.
</P>
<P>
Last month, the Philippine government met its last condition
for the transfer of the money frozen in Swiss bank accounts since
1986 after Marcos was ousted in a revolt.
</P>
<P>
The appeal, an unexpected twist in the 12-year battle over the
money, challenges the finding by the Swiss Office of Police
Affairs that Manila's guarantees are sufficient, the reports said.
</P>
<P>
It was uncertain how long the Swiss Supreme Court will take to
rule on the appeal. The court ruled last December that 100 million
dollars of the Marcos money be returned, then extended the ruling
to cover the entire amount.
</P>
<P>
Peter Cosandey, a leading Swiss prosecutor in the case, said he
had already begun preparing for the transfer. Precious metals and
trust company investments were to be converted to cash, but stocks
and bonds were to be transferred directly.
</P>
<P>
The money was to be placed in an escrow account first, only to
be released to the Philippine government if Imelda Marcos is
convicted in connection with the funds in a fair trial, the
reports said.
</P>
<P>
Imelda is to be tried in the Philippines on charges that her
family plundered about 10 billion dollars from the national
treasury during Marcos's 20-year rule.
</P>
<P>
The Philippines also has to keep the Swiss government informed
of the legal proceedings.
</P>
<P>
Marcos died in exile in Hawaii, the United States, in 1989. He
and his wife insisted that they committed no wrongdoing.

<HEADLINE> Zambia Suspend Coach after Upset Defeat </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>

<P>
LUSAKA, February 14 (Xinhua) -- Zambia's Burkhard Ziese was
suspended by the Zambian football federation after he coached the
national team to a 4-0 defeat in the African Nations' Cup on
Saturday by Egypt.
</P>
<P>
Friday's loss in group D left the team with only a
mathematical chance of reaching the quarter-finals.
</P>
<P>
Ziese, 54, had been in the job for only four months.
</P>
<P>
Zambia have done consistently well in the Nations' Cup without
ever winning it. This year it opened with a draw against
favourites Morocco before hammered by the Egyptians.
</P>
<P>
Shortly before the competition began Ziese had been involved
in a furious row with his captain Kalusha Bwalya.
</P>
<P>
Ziese wanted Bwalya to report for training the full 14 days
before the tournament began while Bwalya wanted some leeway to
play some vital league games for his Mexican club Leon.
</P>
<P>
Ziese threatened to invoke FIFA regulations and ask for a
worldwide ban on Bwalya before the two patched up their row last
week.

BANGKOK, February 15 (Xinhua) -- Thai Foreign Minister Surin
Pitsuwan said his country will seek Indonesia's help on
supplementing its depleting oil supplies for fear that a war may
break out in the Middle East, the Nation newspaper reported
Sunday.
</P>
<P>
Surin said Thailand and other Association of Southeast Asian
Nations (ASEAN) countries may face difficulties in transporting
oil from the Middle East if current conflict between the United
States and Iraq over United Nations weapons inspections evolves to
war.
</P>
<P>
Surin quoted an ASEAN oil-reserve agreement, under which member
countries could supply oil to other members during times of crisis
when there was an oil shortage.
</P>
<P>
Surin made the remarks on Saturday before he left for a six-day
trip to three ASEAN members -- the Philippines, Indonesia and
Malaysia.
</P>

<HEADLINE> Italy, France Push for Annan's Visit to Iraq </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ROME, February 14 (Xinhua) -- Italy and France were fighting to
revive diplomatic efforts to avert military action against Iraq by
pushing for U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan to make a last-ditch
mission to Baghdad.
</P>
<P>
The Italian Foreign Ministry said Saturday that the initiative
was stemmed from a letter of French Foreign Minister Hubert
Vedrine to his Italian counterpart Lamberto Dini Friday night.
</P>
<P>
In the letter, Vedrine said that Annan's mission would aim at
achieving an acceptable compromise which would enable U.N. weapons
inspectors to "work efficiently" in compliance with the U.N.
resolutions.
</P>
<P>
France has led international opposition to a military strike on
Iraq, supported by Italy, Russia and most of the Arab countries.
</P>
<P>
During Russian President Boris Yeltsin's visit to Italy last
week, Italy and Russia issued a joint appeal to exhaust all
diplomatic avenues toward a peaceful solution before considering
the military option. But Italy said military action would be
inevitable if Iraq did not comply with the relevant
U.N. resolutions.

<HEADLINE> State to Slug Speculators </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, February 15 (Xinhua) -- The State Administration of
Foreign Exchange (SAFE), in collaboration with the public security
departments, is working on measures to crack down on black markets
in foreign exchange, today's China Daily (Business Weekly) said.
</P>
<P>
Although under-the-table trading is negligible in terms of
volume compared with official transaction, these markets have
fostered cheating and speculation and disrupted the country's
financial order, SAFE officials said.
</P>
<P>
Specific measures would soon be worked out and implemented, the
officials said. Their targets will be speculation rings,
counterfeiters and illegal sales of foreign currencies by
companies.
</P>
<P>
The crackdown will not be all-embracing, since black markets
are transient by nature and trading mostly occurs between
individuals. The key is to persuade people not to believe rumors
and consolidate their confidence in the renminbi by disseminating
factual information, an official said.
</P>
<P>
People who buy foreign currencies on black markets include
smugglers, people making investments abroad without approval, and
those wrongly believing rumors that the renminbi would be devalued.
</P>
<P>
Li Dongrong, deputy director of the foreign exchange
administration in Guangdong, said black markets are forbidden by
law. people who are involved in black market trading are not
protected by the government, even if they fall prey to fraud by
black marketeers, he warned.
</P>
<P>
There have been reports on cases in which people were cheated
with fake dollars or currencies that were not convertible.
</P>
<P>
Some black marketeers, known as Huangniu (cattle), have tried
profiteering by spreading rumors and stirring up people's fears.
</P>
<P>
Dai Xianglong, governor of the People's Bank of China, told
reporters last month that the black market price did not reflect
the tendency of the renminbi's exchange rate.
</P>
<P>
The renminbi will remain strong, backed by low inflation and
strong economic performance in China, he said.
</P>
<P>
The central bank will consider selling exchange reserves on the
market and increasing the amount of foreign currency Chinese
residents are allowed to change in banks in case of going abroad.

BRASILIA, February 14 (Xinhua) -- One of Brazil's most wanted
fugitives, accused of stealing more than 112 million U.S. dollars,
was extradited to Brazil Saturday to face justice, ending more
than four years on the run.
</P>
<P>
Jorgina Maria de Freitas Fernandes arrived in Rio de Janeiro
early Saturday aboard a Brazilian military airplane and was
transferred to a jail, following Costa Rica's decision to
extradite the woman.
</P>
<P>
De Freitas, a lawyer, had been sentenced in absentia to 14
years in prison by a Brazilian court for her involvement in a 112
million dollar fraud at Brazil's Social Security Institute.
</P>
<P>
She was also accused of organizing a 25-member group to swindle
500 million dollars out of the institute.
</P>
<P>
De Freitas had lived a life on the run since 1992, hidding
herself in Miami of the United States, later in Spain and Costa
Rica, using a number of disguises.
</P>
<P>
She turned herself in to Costa Rican authorities last November,
saying she was tired of eluding the law. Reports said she had
breast cancer.
</P>
<P>
Among the 112 million dollars she got by fraud, 30 million had
been frozen in the U.S. while another 50 million frozen in
Brazil.

<HEADLINE> Myanmar Consumers Urged to Use More Local-Made Goods </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
YANGON, February 15 (Xinhua) -- The official New Light of
Myanmar newspaper Sunday urged the country's consumers to use more
local-made goods instead of foreign ones in the present financial
crisis sweeping the Southeast Asia region.
</P>
<P>
"We have been asking consumers to be frugal in lavishing
themselves with foreign goods and going for more of that 'Made in
Myanmar' brands," the newspaper said in an editorial.
</P>
<P>
"Myanmar has not been directly hit by the crisis but has to
shore up the fallout from what has happened to some of our
neighbors," the editorial pointed out.
</P>
<P>
Following the recent financial crisis in the region, some
countries of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN)
are adopting the "sell more, buy less" formula, said the
editorial. Myanmar should import less and export more, and move
the priority tag from luxury items to more essential ones, such as
medicines, it said.
</P>
<P>
Myanmar has stressed the need to boost production of
import-substitute goods.
</P>
<P>
Myanmar's border trade with neighboring countries has come to a
halt for several months and the government has limited import of
some categories of consumer goods.
</P>
<P>
According to official figures, Myanmar's exports stood at 725.4
million U.S. dollars in the first 10 months of 1997 while its
imports amounted to 1.96 billion dollars.

allegedly destroying four police posts and vandalizing
communication facilities in Dar es Salaam early in the morning.
</P>
<P>
The Dar es Salaam Regional Police Commander Alfred Gewe told

<HEADLINE> SEACEN Asked to Focus on Macroeconomic Stability </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, February 15 (Xinhua) -- Indonesia has called on
members of the Southeast Asian Central Banks Association (SEACEN)
to focus their attention on macroeconomic stability.
</P>
<P>
Addressing the closing of a two-day SEACEN Central Bank
Governors' Conference in Bali, some 1,000 km southeast of Jakarta,
Bank Indonesia Governor Soedradjad Djiwandono said this could be
achieved by bolstering regional cooperation, Antara News Agency
reported Sunday.
</P>
<P>
Soedradjad believed that the forum played a crucial role in
facilitating an active cooperation policy and joint supervision to
promote stability within a freer capital market scheme.
</P>
<P>
He said the problems faced by a country in an increasingly
integrated international environment are not isolated.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Thai Central Bank Governor Chaiyawat Wibulswasdi
said that the task of a central bank was to restore credibility
and confidence.
</P>
<P>
To that end, he said clear-cut and sustainable actions and a
strong determination were needed.
</P>
<P>
Managing Director of the Bank for International Settlements
Andrew Crockett, in his address on monetary stability and
international capital movement, said countries with strong
economic fundamentals could fall victim of the sudden loss of
public confidence.
</P>
<P>
He also said that a country with a sound macro policy would
need adjustments with the constantly changing environment.
</P>
<P>
Liberalization in a domestic monetary system and openness to
the international capital market have to be matched with more
reliable and firmer policies and better control, he noted.
</P>
<P>
SEACEN is a consultative and regional cooperation forum of
central banks and monetary authorities in the Southeast Asia
region. The consultation and cooperation are aimed at promoting
matters relating to common interests, particularly in the economy,
monetary and banking sector.

AMMAN, February 14 (Xinhua) -- King Hussein of Jordan
Saturday called on Iraq to comply with the United Nations
resolutions to end the crisis over weapons inspections.
</P>
<P>
Telling reporters after meeting with Swedish Foreign Minister

In this way, "the crisis can be resolved without a disaster

"War would be a disaster to the whole region" and destroy the

The United States has said it will attack Iraq if it does not

<HEADLINE> ROUNDUP: Will Iraqi Crisis Damage Russian-U.S. </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, February 14 (Xinhua) -- The Iraqi crisis is still in
danger, though Russia has been making every effort to settle it,
and may damage the relations between Russia and the United States.
</P>
<P>
When meeting with visiting U.S. counterpart William Cohen in
Moscow on Thursday Russian Defense Minister Igor Sergeyev
expressed deep concern over the "possible prospects for
Russian-U.S. relations in the military field, especially if
military action occurs."
</P>
<P>
If the U.S. resorts to force to settle the Iraqi crisis, it
would hurt and set back bilateral ties between Russia and the
U.S., Sergeyev warned pointedly.
</P>
<P>
Since the Iraqi crisis occurred Russia has been insisting on
settlement of the crisis through diplomatic ways, but the United
States stands for that if Baghdad use chemical weapons against
U.S. troops and its neighbors, the response will be fast and
resolute.
</P>
<P>
At the same time the Russian minister flatly denied a report in
The Washington Post that UN inspectors had found evidence of a
Russian deal to sell Iraq equipment that could be used to develop
biological weapons.
</P>
<P>
The US allegation enraged the Russian side, that repeatedly
states: Russia has never made any deals with Iraq in violation of
the sanctions or supplied to the Middle East country any equipment
to manufacture biological materials.
</P>
<P>
Cohen, for his part, acknowledged the divergence between the
U.S. and Russia over how to settle the Iraqi problem, but said
"the strength of the underlying relationship is paramount."
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Russian Foreign Minister Yevgeny primakov as well
stated after meeting with the visiting US official that Russia
opposes the use of force against Iraq, but will not create any
coalition opposing the U.S..
</P>
<P>
In view of the "anti-american interpretation" of the Russian
stance on Iraq, Primakov, a Middle East expert, denied recently
that the Russian position does not mean it stands against the
United States.
</P>
<P>
Some analysts here said that the Kremlin has come to defense
Iraq is an attempt to maintain Russia's prestige and influence in
the Arab world, to counterbalance the United States in the Middle
East and to help head off a U.S. military strike.
</P>
<P>
Besides, Russia is worried about the repayment by Iraq of
billions of dollars in debts left over from the Cold War.
</P>
<P>
According to a high-ranking official in the Russian Ministry
for Foreign Economic Relations and Trade, the Iraq's debt to
Russia has already reached 7 billion U.S. dollars. If the
seven-year-old U.N. economic sanctions against Iraq lifted,
Russian-Iraqi trade turnover may soon recover pre-sanction
levels of 1.2 -1.5 billion US dollars annually, the Ministry
holds.
</P>
<P>
Some officials in the United States as well are worried about
that an attack on Iraq would make getting the Duma's cooperation
in ratification of the long-delaied START II nuclear weapons
reduction treaty even harder.
</P>
<P>
"It won't help START II. It won't help military cooperation,
and that is the message that Sergeyev gave Cohen, that there will
be a price for attacking Iraq," they say.
</P>
<P>
U.S. President Bill Clinton Friday said he understands Russia's
concerns and said the United States is exhausting every possible
diplomatic route. But "we don't believe it is acceptable, if
diplomacy fails, to walk away," the U.S. president stressed.
</P>
<P>
At the moment, despite of that Iraq has agreed to open all
points in the territory of Iraq, including eight "presidential
sites" for UN inspection, more than 400 U.S. aircrafts and 19 U.S.
additional fighter planes have been sent to the region to handle
the attack mission. Meanwhile, more than 30,000 American soldiers
and other military forces in the region have been put on the
alert.
</P>
<P>
Once the Gulf war breaks out, the relations between Russia and
the United States can not be kept without damage.

<HEADLINE> Chinese Premier Dined by Dutch Chief Economists </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
AMSTERDAM, February 14 (Xinhua) -- Chinese Premier Li Peng
today briefed Dutch financial experts on China's economy shortly
after his arrival here.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese visitor said, at a luncheon given in his honor by
Dutch Finance Minister Gerrit Zalm, that his country posted an
8.8-percent economic growth with a 1-percent inflation rate.
</P>
<P>
Li estimated that China will maintain a growth rate of more
than 8 percent this year while reining inflation within 3 percent.
</P>
<P>
The finance minister recalled the hospitality he received from
the Chinese premier when he went to Hong Kong to attend last
year's annual meeting of the World Bank and International Monetary
Fund.
</P>
<P>
Extending a warm welcome to Li, Zalm said that the Dutch
finance and entrepreneur sectors are ready to forge, with China, a
cooperative tie in their speciality.
</P>
<P>
He said that China played a constructive role of stabilization
during the recent financial turmoil in southeast Asia, hoping
China continue to play this role.
</P>
<P>
The Dutch host said that the Netherlands and China should
further their economic cooperation in the future.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese premier said that he was glad to visit this
beautiful country where the first project he saw was the
flood-protection dike, which reclaimed land from the sea. Water
conservancy is well in his ken, he added.
</P>
<P>
"The project aroused a great deal of my interest," said the
premier, "and it proved the Dutch people are great."
</P>
<P>
The dike project took 30 years to complete at a cost of 12
billion Dutch guilders, Li said, adding because of its complexity
in the construction technology and engineering, the Dutch people
have nicknamed the dike a "moon-landing project".
</P>
<P>
The Chinese premier said that finance has become one of the key
players in world economy and that the recent financial crisis in
southeast Asia almost shocked the entire world, which is still in
the shadow of the crisis.
</P>
<P>
Hong Kong was affected to an extent as well but the government
of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region successfully
defended the link between the Hong Kong dollar and the U.S.
dollar, securing the financial stability in the region.
</P>
<P>
"Although the shock wave of the Asian financial crisis was not
directly felt in inland China," said the Chinese premier, "we had
to pay due attention to the crisis in that it may exert a braking
influence on the country's economy.
</P>
<P>
"We have to remain vigilant and must draw lessons from the
Asian crisis and work out preventive measures," said the Chinese
premier.
</P>
<P>
Li Peng said that the reason China had kept economic and
financial stability during the Asian financial crisis is that it
has enjoyed rather rapid economic development in the past two
decades.
</P>
<P>
Though there had been a period of high inflation in the process
of development, China started to redress the problem several years
ago, the Chinese premier said.
</P>
<P>
Another reason for the economic and financial stability in
China is that the country has taken cautious financial policies.
</P>
<P>
Though it is still a developing country, China has drawn an
overseas investment of some 360 billion U.S. dollars, of which 220
billion are direct investment.
</P>
<P>
Li said that China is competent to repay the invested money in
that the country now boasts of a foreign reserve upward of 140
billion dollars.
</P>
<P>
Most of the debts are long-term and project-linked loans,
mostly arranged by the World Bank and the International Monetary
Fund. China, therefore, does not face a problem of insolvency, the
Chinese visitor explained.
</P>
<P>
Chinese economy had experienced overheated enthusiasm in
certain sectors, but the authorities waged macro-readjustment
three years ago to have achieved obvious results.
</P>
<P>
By 1996 sustained growth with low inflation had formed a
healthy trend of development, Li reassured his audience.
</P>
<P>
The financial and economic circles the world over take great
concern over the possibility of devaluation of the Chinese
currency, Li Peng said, adding that China's policy is to stabilize
the exchange rate of Renminbi.
</P>
<P>
"China has to pay due price for the stabilization of the
exchange rate inflicted by the influence upon its exports. But we
can make good the influence by reducing the cost and improving the
quality of the export-oriented products and readjusting the
composition of export-oriented products," Li added.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese premier said that it is worthwhile to make the
sacrifice in that China aspires to maintain the economic stability
within a stable environment formed by stable neighboring
countries.
</P>
<P>
The financial circle in Europe does not have to worry because
China will not change its current financial policy, Li assured
those present at the luncheon.
</P>
<P>
Present at the luncheon were Li's entourage and the central
banker of the Netherlands, and local financial and economic
celebrities.

ANKARA, February 14 (Xinhua) -- Turkish President Suleyman
Demirel Saturday voiced support to Azerbaijan in its conflicts
with Armenia, but calling for peaceful solution to the issue.
</P>
<P>
He made the remarks at a joint press conference with visiting
Azerbaijani President Geidar Aliyev in Istanbul, the largest city
of Turkey, following their official talks. Aliyev arrived in
Istanbul on Friday for a two-day visit to Turkey.
</P>
<P>
Demirel said that he would call on the Armenian government to
secure peace and stability in the region.
</P>
<P>
Azerbaijan and Armenia have been disputing since early 1990s
over status of Nagorno-Karabakh, a strip within the boundaries of
Azerbaijan but populated mostly by Armenians. Talks were initiated
four years ago, but no breakthrough was made.
</P>
<P>
Demirel added that "It is impossible to accept a solution
without a principle of the protection of the territorial integrity
of Azerbaijan."
</P>
<P>
On the issue, Turkey stands on the Azerbaijani side with which
it has traditional and cultural links.
</P>
<P>
At a breakfast given in honor Aliyev in Istanbul, Aliyev said
that Armenia should withdraw from the Azerbaijani territory it
occupied and that 1 million Azerbaijanis who had to leave their
homes should return.
</P>
<P>
Aliyev said that he wants Azerbaijan-Armenia problem to be
solved through peaceful means and that he favors normalization of
relations with Armenia.
</P>
<P>
Both leaders said that Turkey and Azerbaijan will cement their
economic cooperation and strengthen friendship.
</P>
<P>
There are 800 companies in Azerbaijan established with the
capital of Turkish businessmen and 40 companies in Turkey set up
with the capital of Azerbaijani businessmen, said Demirel.

AMMAN, February 14 (Xinhua) -- Jordanian King Hussein
Saturday stressed the necessity to contain the crisis over arms
inspections in an effort to avoid any possible attack on Iraq by
the United States.
</P>
<P>
Military actions will only increase the sufferings of the Iraqi
people and bring disasters to the Middle East, said the king while
meeting with Iraqi Foreign Minister Mohammed Saeed al-Sahhaf.
</P>
<P>
The crisis should be handled with wisdom and seriousness, and
any opportunity should not be missed to reach a peaceful solution,
he added.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Hussein called on Iraq to comply with the U.N.
Security Council resolutions to avoid a war.
</P>
<P>
Iraq has proposed to open eight presidential sites to the arms
inspectors appointed by the U.N. chief.
</P>
<P>
But the U.S. has rejected the proposal and said it will attack
Iraq if it does not grant unfettered and unconditional access to
the arms inspectors to all sites suspected of hiding weapons of
mass destruction and programs to make them.
</P>
<P>
During the meeting, al-Sahhaf said that Iraq will continue its
work to find a diplomatic solution that will meet U.N. demands and
preserve his country's sovereignty.
</P>
<P>
Al-Sahhaf arrived in Amman Thursday as part of his regional
tour to rally support for Iraq's position on the crisis. He has
