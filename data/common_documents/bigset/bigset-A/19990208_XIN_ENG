<P>
UNITED NATIONS, February 7 (Xinhua) -- U.N. Secretary-General
Kofi Annan on Sunday mourned over the passing of King Hussein of
Jordan.
</P>
<P>
King Hussien died on Sunday, two days after returning to the
country following failed treatment for cancer.
</P>
<P>
In a statement issued by his spokesman's office, Annan said "It
was a deep and personal sense of grief that I learned today of the
death of His Majesty King Hussein Ibn Talal of the Hashemite
Kingdom of Jordan. I extend my most heartfelt condolences to his
family and to the people of Jordan."
</P>
<P>
"Today, the world mourns the passing of a king whose true
majesty found expression in a lifelong struggle to bring peace to
the ordinary men and women of the Middle East. I recall fondly our
meeting in March 1997 in New york. He was typically warm and wise,
yet anguished about the persistence of conflict and suffering, in
the Middle East and elsewhere," Annan said.
</P>
<P>
"Overcoming his own pain at Wye Plantation last October, he
showed again the courage that is an essential in any peace
process. His death challenges us to finish the job. I will always
remember his many contributions, for King Hussein was one of he
United Nations' most valuable partners for peace," Annan
continued.
</P>
<P>
"At this difficult time, His Majesty King Abdullah deserves the
support of the entire international community as he continues the
crucial work towards peace and prosperity pursued so energetically
and tirelessly by his father. I pledged to him my full support,"
the Annan added.

BEIJING, February 7 (Xinhua) -- Chinese President Jiang Zemin
Sunday expressed deep grievances over the death of Jordanian King
Hussein and highly praised his contributions to the Middle East
peace process.
</P>
<P>
In a message of condolences to Jordan's new king, Abdullah Bin
Hussein, Jiang hailed King Hussein as "a distinguished leader of
the Jordanian people and an outstanding statesman of the Arab
world."
</P>
<P>
King Hussein had devoted all his life to the prosperity of the
Hashemite Kingdom and the peace process of the Middle East, and
made important contributions in the regard, Jiang said.
</P>

The Chinese president said that King Hussein, as an old friend
of the Chinese people, had also worked effectively to strengthen
and develop the Sino-Jordanian relations and "made precious
contributions."
</P>

Jiang said he believed that, under the leadership of King
Abdullah, the Jordanian government and its people would inherit
the behest of the deceased King Hussein and carry on his
unfinished causes.

<HEADLINE> Clinton Praises Late King Hussein's Role for Peace </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, February 7 (xinhua) -- U.S. President Bill Clinton
on Sunday called the late King Hussein of Jordan a "friend and
inspiration" who exhibited "a rare kind of courage to be a
peacemaker."
</P>
<P>
"No words can convey what King Hussein meant to the people he
led for nearly half a century. Words cannot convey what he meant
to me as a friend and inspiration. Through good times and bad,
through health and illness, he showed the power of a strong will
applied to a worthy cause," Clinton said in a statement.
</P>
<P>
The king, 63, who was monarch of his strategically placed
nation for 43 years, died on Sunday of heat failure, thus lost his
battle with cancer in Amman.
</P>
<P>
Clinton said he and his wife Lady Hillary Rodham Clinton had
prayed that "this day would not come soon. But God has called King
Hussein to his reward."
</P>
<P>
Clinton said he remembered a recent meeting with Hussein, in
which the monarch put aside his personal health struggle to speak
about the Middle East peace.
</P>
<P>
"It takes a rare kind of courage to be a peacemaker -- the
courage to learn from the past and imagine a better future," he
said. "When peace finally comes to the Middle East, his name will
be inscribed upon it. That day, King Hussein will smile on us one
more time."
</P>
<P>
Clinton and his wife are expected to lead the U.S. delegation
to Hussein's funeral, which Jordanian officials said would take
place on Monday. Clinton was expected to leave Washington on
Sunday afternoon and Mrs. Clinton, who was speaking at a U.N.
conference in the Netherlands on Sunday, was expected to join him
in Jordan.
</P>
<P>
Former President George Bush, Jimmy Carter and Gerald Ford also
are expected to attend the funeral.
</P>
<P>
Secretary of State Madeleine Albright called the king one of
the century's "finest and most courageous statesman" who was "a
wise, eloquent and deeply committed partisan of peace."
</P>
<P>
The king played a supporting role to Clinton at talks in
Maryland in October that produced an agreement on Israel's pullout
from the West Bank between Israel and the Palestinians.
</P>
<P>
Albright noted that the king "rose from his sickbed" during
cancer treatment "to inspire the Palestinians and Israelis to
move forward on the road to peace."

<HEADLINE> Zimbabwe's Vice-President Lashes Out at </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, February 7 (Xinhua) -- Zimbabwe's Vice-President Simon
Muzenda has accused some independent media organizations of
fomenting political agendas aimed at destroying the government.
</P>
<P>
Officiating at a ground-breaking ceremony for the Manyame
Tourism Center in Zvimba, some 100 kilometers west of capital
Harare Saturday, Muzenda said that some sections of the
independent papers were basing their stories in rumors.
</P>
<P>
Muzenda's remarks came in the wake of publication of stories
criticizing the government in the independent local and foreign
media organizations which he said were damaging Zimbabwe's
reputation abroad, the Sunday Mail newspaper reported.
</P>
<P>
Some media organizations were doubling salaries of journalists
in order to lure them to write stories critical of the government,
the vice- president was quoted as saying.
</P>
<P>
A local publication recently alleged that a coup which was
aimed at toppling President Robert Mugabe was foiled by army
officials and the perpetrators had been jailed at Chikurubi
Maximum Prison in the capital.
</P>
<P>
Muzenda also dismissed Supreme Court judges and international
human rights organizations' petitions to the president questioning
if the country still had the rule of law.
</P>
<P>
"We have not violated any human rights since we started ruling
in 1980," Muzenda said.
</P>
<P>
He also said the involvement of Zimbabwe in the Democratic
Republic of Congo (DRC), which has become an issue of criticism by
the independent media, was an international duty the country was
extending in light of the help it got from other countries during
its war of liberation.

<P>
"If there is no success in immediately containing this
conflict, the development progress of decades will be destroyed in

He appealed to Ethiopian Prime Minister Meles Zenawi and
Eritrean President Isaias Afwerki to strictly abide by a
moratorium both have agreed to on air raids against the other's
territory.
</P>

He said the situation should not be allowed to become even
worse. The European Union (E.U.) would be consulting immediately
over how to respond. Germany holds the presidency of the E.U.
until this June.
</P>
<P>
He said all the mediatory capacity of the United Nations and
the Organization of African Unity needed to be utilized to achieve
an immediate truce in the fighting.

<HEADLINE> Khatami Blames U.S. for Opposing Piping via Iran </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, February 7 (Xinhua) -- Iranian President Mohammad
Khatami on Sunday blamed the United States for its opposition to
the project to export oil and gas from the Caspian region through
Iran.
</P>
<P>
In a meeting with visiting Turkmen Foreign Minister Boris
Shikhmyradov, Khatami said that Iran offers the best route for
transfer of Turkmen gas to the world.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. opposition to the project tramples upon the interests
of all regional states and those of European countries for the
sake of its own interests, he said.
</P>
<P>
Khatami stressed that the Iranian route is the most economical
and safest for transfer of Turkmen gas to Europe, the Islamic
Republic News Agency reported.
</P>
<P>
He expressed confidence that regional states and oil firms,
even the American ones, will not accept other costly and
non-economical routes.
</P>
<P>
The Iranian president underlined the importance of the project
to transfer Turkmen gas via Iranian territory, and voiced Tehran's
readiness to carry out other projects in Turkmenistan.
</P>
<P>
On Iran's foreign policy, Khatami said that Iran's diplomacy
is based on the principle of mutual respect.
</P>
<P>
"Any government is free to establish ties with others," he
said, "but we believe that if we fail to have good relations with
one another and fall short of maintaining stability and security
in the region, relations with others will not be in our favor."
</P>
<P>
Terming Tehran-Ashkhabad relations as "deep-rooted and strong,"
he said the relations have been constantly growing since the
independence of the former Soviet republic.
</P>
<P>
Shikhmyradov, for his part, congratulated Khatami on the 20th
anniversary of the 1979 Islamic Revolution and said that his
country gives priority to the option of transferring its gas via
Iran.
</P>
<P>
Shikhmyradov arrived here on Saturday and left here for home
on Sunday after concluding his short visit.

<HEADLINE> Kuwaiti Prime Minister to Attend Hussein's Funeral </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUWAIT CITY, February 7 (Xinhua) -- Kuwait's Crown Prince and
Prime Minister Sheikh Saad Al-Abdullah Al-Sabah will leave for
Jordan on Monday to attend the funeral of King Hussein who died
earlier Sunday.
</P>
<P>
Accompanying him will be a high-level delegation, which
includes deputy head of Kuwait's National Guards Sheikh Nawaf
Al-Ahmad Al-Sabah, Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of State for
Cabinet Affairs Abdul Aziz Al-Dakhil and Interior Minister Sheikh
Mohammed Al-Khaled Al-Sabah.
</P>
<P>
Senior officials at Sheikh Saad's court will also be present,
the Kuwait News Agency reported.
</P>
<P>
Sheikh Saad has already sent condolences to Jordan's new King
Abdullah Bin Al-Hussein over the death of his father.
</P>
<P>
A statement issued by Kuwait's Royal Palace earlier Sunday
declared two days of mourning, with Kuwaiti national flags at home
and at embassies abroad being lowered to half mast on Sunday and
Monday.
</P>
<P>
Kuwait and Jordan have been improving their relations soured
after Iraq's invasion of Kuwait in 1990, when Amman, along with
few other Arab states, sided with Baghdad.
</P>
<P>
Kuwaiti Foreign Minister Sabah Al-Ahmad Al-Sabah has said if
his Jordanian counterpart Abdel Ilah Al-Khateeb "comes everything
will be settled," a clear indication that the bilateral ties
between the two Arab countries will be fully restored very soon.
</P>
<P>
However, Al-Khateeb's planned visit to Kuwait on Saturday was
postponed because of Hussein's critical health condition.
</P>
<P>
Sabah, also the first deputy prime minister, put off his own
trip to Amman in late January because of Hussein's rush back to
the United States for the treatment of his cancer relapse.

MOSCOW, February 7 (Xinhua) -- Russian President Boris Yeltsin
will head the Russian governmental delegation to attend the
funeral of King Hussein of Jordan, Itar-Tass reported Sunday.
</P>
<P>
Tass, quoting unidentified sources, said the delegation will
leave for Amman, the Jordanian capital, early Monday.
</P>
<P>
King Hussein died of lymphatic cancer at 11:43 local time
(09:43 GMT) in Amman on Sunday at the age of 63.
</P>
<P>
Yeltsin's trip to Amman, if materialized, would be his first
one overseas since October, when he cut short a visit to Central
Asia due to illness.
</P>
<P>
The 68-year-old president has been in and out of hospital in
the past few months.
</P>
<P>
His latest stay in the Central Clinical Hospital, where he was
treated for acute gastric ulcer bleeding, ended January 31, when
he moved to the Barvikha sanatorium outside Moscow.
</P>
<P>
Yeltsin's previous visit to the Middle East was made almost two
years ago. On March 13, 1996, he attended a summit on the Middle
East peace process and measures against international terrorism in
Sharm ash-Shaykh, Egypt, Tass said.

<HEADLINE> Ethiopia Says Eritrean Shelling of Adigrat </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ADDIS ABABA, February 7 (Xinhua) -- The Office of Ethiopian
Government Spokesperson Selome Taddesse said on Sunday evening
that the Eritrean forces shelled the Ethiopian town of Adigrat
with heavy artillery early Sunday morning.
</P>
<P>
A statement issued by the office said the shelling started at
4:40 a.m. and lasted half an hour. Three houses were destroyed and
 seven civilians were seriously injured in the attacks, it added.
</P>
<P>
Adigrat, a border town near the Ethio-Eritrean border, was
attacked by an Eritrean plane on June 11, 1998, when four
civilians were killed and 30 others wounded.
</P>
<P>
Referring to Sunday's battlefield on Badme/Sheraro front which
renewed fighting Saturday, the statement said: "Eritrea has today
been continuously launching counter offensives against Ethiopian
forces in an attempt to recapture the important stronghold of Geza
Gerlase which Ethiopia won yesterday."
</P>
<P>
"The Ethiopian army has successfully repelled these attacks
and continues to hold the post it gained yesterday," it said.
</P>
<P>
"In addition to holding Geza Gerlase, the Ethiopian army has
forced the Eritrean troops to retreat," it added.
</P>
<P>
The nine-month Ethio-Eritrean border dispute broke out on May
6, 1998 and hundreds were killed during the first six weeks of
fighting between the two Horn of African neighbors.

<HEADLINE> UK to Unveil World's Largest Artificial Sky </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, February 7 (Xinhua) -- British scientists are to unveil
the world's largest artificial sky for architects at the end of
this month, The Sunday Times newspaper said on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
The new facility, to be opened at Cardiff University's School
of Architecture, will allow researchers and designers to simulate
lighting conditions within buildings, using scale models and can
create weather conditions for any location on Earth at any time.
</P>
<P>
It will accurately simulate external lighting conditions due to
the combined influences of the sun, the sky and clouds, and
reflections from the ground and nearby structures.
</P>
<P>
Scale models of buildings will be placed on the turntable rig,
which is eight meters in diameter. An array of 640 fluorescent
lamps controlled by a computer will simulate various states of
daylight and cloud.
</P>
<P>
The artificial sky simulation can help architects to find the
right location and best orientation for buildings so as to make
the most of the daylight and solar energy.

<HEADLINE> New Chip Could Slim Down Mobiles to The Size of A Watch </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, February 7 (Xinhua) -- British computer scientists are
developing a new type of chip that will allow mobile phones to be
the size of wristwatches.
</P>
<P>
The Amulet III chip, developed by a team at Manchester
University, will be unveiled this June and is expected to be
marketed for mobile phones next year.
</P>
<P>
Philips, which has worked with the EU-funded Manchester
researchers in the past, in a potential customer of the new chip,
The Sunday Times newspaper reported Sunday.
</P>
<P>
The chip differs from conventional technology because it does
not rely on a central clock to co-ordinate messages going from one
part of a chip to another.
</P>
<P>
This "asynchronous" design means the chip does not cause
interference in a device's circuitry and so cuts down on the need
for shielding, which is a vital step in slimming down phones and
gadgets.
</P>
<P>
Unlike conventional chips that uses more power as they are
generally left to carry on ticking, even when they have little or
nothing to do, the new chip uses power only when needed.

<HEADLINE> Funeral of Jordan's King Not to Interrupt Clinton Trial </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, February 7 (Xinhua) -- The impeachment trial of
U.S. President Bill Clinton will continue as scheduled although
two senators will join the U.S. delegation attending the funeral
of Jordan's King Hussein, an aide to Senate Republican Leader
Trent Lott said Sunday.
</P>
<P>
Hussein died of cancer Sunday in his sickbed in Hussein medical
Center at the age of 63. The monarch had been hospitalized since
his return home Friday morning from a U.S. hospital after a second
and fatally unsuccessful bone marrow transplant as part of
lymphatic cancer treatments.
</P>
<P>
Lott and Senate Democratic Leader Tom Daschle were choosing a
two-senator delegation for the funeral. "The trial will not be
interrupted," Lott spokesman John Czwartacki said.
</P>
<P>
He said Ted Stevens will represent the Republican side at the
funeral. The Democratic participant was still undecided.
</P>
<P>
They will miss closing arguments by the House trial prosecutors
and the White House lawyers, scheduled for next Monday, but are
scheduled to be back by Tuesday when the Senate is likely to vote
on whether to open up deliberations by the senators on the two
impeachment counts against the president.
</P>
<P>
Those deliberations, the last step before the Senate votes on
whether to convict the president and remove him from office, are
now scheduled to be in secret.
</P>
<P>
Clinton, who went on trial in the Senate on January 7, is
charged with perjury and obstruction of justice in two articles of
impeachment in connection with his relationship with Lewinsky. The
two articles were approved by the House along partisan lines on
December 19 last year.
</P>
<P>
The Senate is expected to vote on the two articles of
impeachment against Clinton on February 12. A two-thirds vote is
needed to convict the president and remove him from office. No one
believes there are enough votes in the Senate to remove Clinton.

<HEADLINE> Roundup: Jordan's Power Transition Smooth  by Wang Bingfei </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
AMMAN, February 7 (Xinhua) -- Jordan's new king, Abdullah Bin
Hussein, was sworn in on Sunday, marking a smooth transition of
power from his father late King Hussein, the longest reigning
ruler in the Middle East.
</P>
<P>
During a brief sworn-in ceremony, the 37-year-old Abdullah
pledged loyalty to the constitution, Jordanian people and the
throne.
</P>
<P>
The sworn-in ceremony was held at a special session of the
parliament presided over by Speaker of the Senate Zeid Rifai and
attended by Royal family members, Prime Minister Fayez Tarawneh
and other government ministers.
</P>
<P>
Abdullah, the eldest son of Hussein who died of lymphatic
cancer Sunday morning, kissed and hugged royal family members and
senior government officials after he was sworn in.
</P>
<P>
In a sign of solidarity, the new king's uncle Prince Hassan,
who was deposed two weeks ago after 34 years as crown prince,
attended the ceremony.
</P>
<P>
He had been seen walking shoulder by shoulder with Abdullah
into the parliament building.
</P>
<P>
Prior to the ceremony, Abdullah had been exercising full
royal powers since early Saturday morning, when Hussein, lying
unconscious in a military hospital, was proclaimed unable to carry
out constitutional duties.
</P>
<P>
The duties included declaring wars, signing major international
accords, dismissing the parliament and appointing a new government.
</P>
<P>
Abdullah, a major general, commands an elite commando unit in
charge of internal security and the royal family's safety.
</P>
<P>
Undoubtedly, Abdullah enjoys a strong military background and
the special force under Abdullah`s command will serve as a
stabilizing factor in the post-Hussein era of the Hashemite
kingdom.
</P>
<P>
It is true that Abdullah, who showed little ambition outside
the army until he was named successor on January 26, apparently
lacked experience in politics and the charisma of Hussein, who
ruled the country for 46 years and was known for his high-profile
contacts with the West.
</P>
<P>
But U.S. President Bill Clinton acted swiftly on the news of
Hussein`s death, sending a message of condolences to the Jordanian
people while calling the Jordanian people to united under their
new ruler Abdullah.
</P>
<P>
Clinton, a close friend of Hussein, also reiterated continued
U.S. support for Jordan after Abdullah was sworn in.
</P>
<P>
He said he will rush to the U.S. Congress next week to seek its
approval for an additional 300 million dollars financial aid to
Jordan.
</P>
<P>
What is more, Abdullah is unlikely to face opposition from
Jordan's Palestinian refugee population, which accounts for over
half of Jordanian 4.2 million people, because his wife Queen Rania
is of Palestinian origin from the Western Bank.
</P>
<P>
The new Jordanian monarch has also developed close relations
with young princes and emirs of the ruling families of the Gulf
states.
</P>
<P>
Abdullah has pledged to follow the footsteps of Hussein in
domestic and foreign policies, particularly concerning the Mideast
peace process.
</P>
<P>
But to be sure, it takes time for Abdullah to fill the vacancy
left by Hussein, who had been a key and active player in the peace
process in the region.

<P>
BAGHDAD, February 7 (Xinhua) -- Iraqi President Saddam Hussein
on Sunday met with his senior military commanders and air defense
specialists to discuss means of strengthening Iraq's air defense
capability.
</P>
<P>
The Iraqi News Agency reported that Iraqi defense minister,
commander of Special Republican Forces and commander of air
defense force were among the attendants.
</P>
<P>
It quoted Saddam as saying that Iraq will not be frightened by
the U.S. and will continue to confront the U.S. and British
warplanes violating Iraq's airspace.
</P>
<P>
After the mid-December U.S.-British bombardment, Iraq declared
it will not recognize the no-fly zones imposed by the U.S.-led
Western allies and will fire on U.S. and British warplanes
policing these zones.
</P>
<P>
There have been clashes between Iraqi air defense units and
U.S. and British jets patrolling these restricted zones in both
the south and north of Iraq.
</P>
<P>
Saddam has posted awards for anyone who shoots down an allied
plane or missile, or capture a pilot.
</P>
<P>
Earlier this week, Saddam chaired a meeting of officials in
the industrial sector to discuss means of improving Iraq's air
defense system.
</P>
<P>
The U.S.-led Western allies declared the no-fly zones in the
wake of the 1991 Gulf War with the claimed aim of protecting the
Kurds in the north and the Shiite Muslims in the south from
"Baghdad's suppression."
</P>
<P>
Citing their lack of U.N. authorization, Iraq considers these
restricted zones as illegal.

Demirel said he is confident that Hussein's successor, King

<HEADLINE> News Analysis: Jordan's New King Faces Challenges </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
AMMAN, February 7 (Xinhua) -- Jordan's new king, Abdullah Ibn
Hussein, was sworn in on Sunday in the face of daunting political,
economic and diplomatic challenges.
</P>
<P>
The 37-year-old king, with most of his adult life spent in the
military, has been under speculation about his political
expertise in reigning a post-King Hussein's Jordan.
</P>
<P>
Analysts said Abdullah will have to rely on good advisers much
more than on moral authority and political instincts which his
father, the late King Hussein so ably used for decades.
</P>
<P>
To maintain future stability, he will have to draw on strong
state institutions, on more active Cabinet involvement in the
daily affairs of the nation and on deepening a nascent democracy,
they said.
</P>
<P>
"So far, all public manifestations have reflected a smooth
succession change and will hopefully herald a smooth transition
into the future," a local analyst said.
</P>
<P>
Abdullah has been presiding over the affairs of state and
meeting top government and military officials ever since his
father fell into a coma.
</P>
<P>
Economic difficulties are a major concern on the part of most
of the Jordanians. Poverty is hitting an estimated 30 percent of
the population, and unemployment is put at 16 percent officially
but much higher by independent analysis.
</P>
<P>
In the diplomatic arena, the new king is facing a task of
improving ties with two major neighbors.
</P>
<P>
Jordanian-Iraqi ties have remained cool since the Jordanian
government called for a change in Baghdad after top Iraqi
defections to Jordan in August 1995.
</P>
<P>
Amman relies on Iraq for its full oil supplies and Baghdad
remains the kingdom's main market.
</P>
<P>
Relations between Jordan and Syria soured after Jordan signed a
peace treaty with Israel in 1994, though Syrian President Hafez
al-Assad telephoned the late king at least once during his illness.
</P>
<P>
Despite all the challenges, Jordanians generally have
confidence in their new king as he has had chances to learn from
his father and has come to appreciate and understand much about
the country's social-economic problems through his involvement in
the kingdom's intricate security portfolio.
</P>
<P>
"He has had plenty of opportunity to observe how the King deals
with Jordan's difficult circumstances," says a relative of
Abdullah.
</P>
<P>
Abdullah has pledged to continue Jordan's "traditional policy"
on the Middle East peace process and on Iraq, and to push forward
with democratic reforms.
</P>
<P>
"I am an extension of His Majesty's outlook and His Majesty's
beliefs," he once said to a newspaper.
</P>
<P>
Abdullah has been overwhelmed by world wide support since
Hussein appointed him in place of his uncle, Prince Hassan Bin
Talal, who had been the designated heir to the throne for the past
34 years.

<HEADLINE> News Analysis: Israel Uneasy over Loss of Hussein </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, February 7 (Xinhua) -- Despite expressing belief
that Jordanian King Hussein's policy will continue after his
death, Israel is deeply concerned over the situation in Amman
following the loss of its most reliable peace partner.
</P>
<P>
Hussein died Sunday morning after losing a seven-month battle
against lymphatic cancer, and his eldest son Abdullah Bin Hussein,
who was named crown prince two weeks ago, was sworn in as the new
king of Jordan hours later.
</P>
<P>
As a statesman of courage and vision, Hussein was the first
Arab leader to seek peace with Israel as early as 1960s, a period
in which hostility and tension between the Jewish state and the
Arab world were mounting high.
</P>
<P>
Only three weeks after the end of the 1967 Middle East war, in
which Jordan lost the whole West Bank and part of Jerusalem to
Israel, the king expressed his willingness to sign a peace treaty
with the Jewish state.
</P>
<P>
After more than 20 years of secret negotiations, he at long
last signed a peace treaty with Israel in 1994, ending the state
of hostility.
</P>
<P>
To date, Jordan is one of the only two Arab states that have
peace treaty with Israel. The other is Egypt.
</P>
<P>
Hussein had played a pivotal role in the whole Middle East
peace process, especially on the Israeli-Palestinian track, who
helped broker the Hebron agreement in early 1997 and the Wye River
accord last October.
</P>
<P>
His courage, sincerity and personal chrisma have won him wide
respect from different Israeli governments and the Israeli
people. In Israel, he was regarded as the most reliable and true
peace partner in the Arab world.
</P>
<P>
Besides, Israel views Jordan as a keystone of stability in the
region.
</P>
<P>
Sandwiched between Israel and Iraq, one of the bitter enemies
regarded by the Jewish state, Jordan has been seen by Israel as a
strategic buffer zone to its east.
</P>
<P>
And with over half of its population being Palestinians,
Jordan's ability to maintain domestic stability will be of vital
importance for the stability of Israel.
</P>
<P>
Therefore, Israel has made no secret that its relations with
Jordan are part of the strategic component of its national
security.
</P>
<P>
Israel has watched closely the situation in Amman since the
gravely-illed king surprisingly changed the succession on January
26, naming Abdullah as heir to the throne to replace his brother
Hassan, who had been crown prince for 34 years.
</P>
<P>
The government, the military and the media have been very busy
to assess the new development - getting more information about the
new successor, evaluating his ability to secure a smooth
transition and thus the Jordan's stability and making sure that
the policy of peace and friendship with Israel laid by the late
king will be carried on.
</P>
<P>
Careful not to show too much doubt over the ability of the new
ruler, an inexperienced and untested political leader, Israel has
repeatedly stressed that it is in the interests of both countries
to continue their friendly relations.
</P>
<P>
After the death of Hussein, Israel was among the first
countries to express the grief.
</P>
<P>
The heads of Israeli government, parliament and opposition
parties have quickly reacted to the sad news from Amman,
expressing condolences over the loss of the "great leader" and
"the brave soldier who fought for peace."
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, almost all of them expressed belief that the new
king will follow the path of peace blazed by his father and
maintain friendship with Israel.
</P>
<P>
However, while there almost certainly will be no significant
policy change in Jordan, it remains to be seen whether the new
king will be willing to go as far as his father did with regards
to Jordan's relations with Israel.
</P>
<P>
Also, although the power transition was smooth, it is far from
certain that the Hashemite kingdom, with a large population living
in poverty, will remain trouble-free in the long run.
</P>
<P>
When Israeli leaders said they are certain about the stability
in Jordan and in the Israeli-Jordanian relations, observers
pointed out, what they were really saying was that "we hope we can
be certain about that."

<HEADLINE> Arab League Mourns Death of King Hussein </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, February 7 (Xinhua) -- Arab League Secretary General
Esmat Abdel-Meguid Sunday expressed deep grief over the death of
Jordanian King Hussein, the longest reigning leader in the Middle
East.
</P>
<P>
Abdel-Meguid said Hussein's death is a loss of the Jordanian
people and the Arab nation as a whole, adding that the Arab world
has lost a great statesman, whose role was imminent in all areas.
</P>
<P>
He expressed confidence that the new king, Abdullah Bin
Hussein, will continue to play the role of Jordan that his father
did in advancing the Mideast peace process.
</P>
<P>
The 63-year-old king died Sunday morning after losing a
seven-month battle against lymphatic cancer and his eldest son,
Abdullah was sworn in as the new king before the parliament and
cabinet hours later.
</P>
<P>
Abdel-Meguid is to go to Amman Monday to attend the funeral of
Hussein, who had ruled the Hashemite kingdom since 1952.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the Arab League's general secretariat issued a
statement in the day, mourning the death of Hussein.
</P>
<P>
The Arab nation and the Islamic world "have lost a great
leader," who devoted his life to his country and managed to build
a modern state and consecrate solid democratic institutions, the
statement said.
</P>
<P>
It expressed belief that Abdullah will follow his father's
principles based on promoting the kingdom's development and
prosperity, Arab solidarity and a just, durable and comprehensive
peace in the region.
</P>
<P>
The flag of the 22-nation pan-Arab forum will be lowered to
half staff in the next three days for mourning the departure of
the old king.

<HEADLINE> Iran Arrests Spy and MKO Members </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, February 7 (Xinhua) -- Iranian Intelligence Ministry
said on Sunday that one spy and 10 members of the outlawed
opposition Mujahideen Khalq Organization (MKO) have been arrested.
</P>
<P>
The ministry said in a statement that the arrests were made in
the western province of Hamadan, according to the Islamic Republic
News Agency.
</P>
<P>
The spy had intended to gather intelligence on military
installations, economic and social issues of the western province
to transmit the intelligence to the aliens, the statement said.
</P>
<P>
However, it did not mention the identity of the spy and for
which country he worked, but said that the spy has confessed to
his treasonable acts.
</P>
<P>
The statement said that 10 MKO members members were arrested as
they tried to flee from the western border-point to join their
"terrorist collaborators," apparent in Iraq.
</P>
<P>
The MKO was once a major political group, along with the
Islamic clerics, in fighting against late shah's regime, which was
overthrown in the 1979 Islamic Revolution. But it was declared
illegal in 1981 after its political quarrel with the mullah rulers
in Tehran.
</P>
<P>
Now based in Iraq, the MKO frequently launched military attacks
on Iranian interests inside and outside the country.
</P>
<P>
Late last month, the MKO claimed responsibility for a bomb
attack in Tehran in which the Intelligence Ministry was targeted,
in an attempt to mar the celebrations of the 20th anniversary of
Islamic Revolution.
</P>
<P>
In its statement on Sunday, the Intelligence Ministry also said
that it arrested a "band of sixteen corrupt elements" who have
been spreading "all forms of corruption and debasement."
</P>
<P>
Some prohibited material like the satellite dishes were
confiscated from them, the statement added.

<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, February 8 (Xinhua) -- The following are major news
items in leading U.S. newspapers on Monday.
</P>
<P>
The Washington Post:
</P>
<P>
-- King of Jordan Hussein's death was felt around the globe as
scores of foreign leaders and dignitaries made plans to attend his
funeral Monday. "I mourn the loss of a partner and friend,"
President Bill Clinton said before departing for Amman accompanied
by three former presidents -- George Bush, Jimmy Carter and Gerald
Ford.
</P>
<P>
-- No matter what the personal abilities of Jordan's new king
Abdullah, he may be too preoccupied with consolidating his rule at
home and a host of thorny domestic problems to plunge quickly or
publicly into the thicket of regional politics.
</P>
<P>
The New York Times:
</P>
<P>
-- Fast approaching the end of President Clinton's impeachment
trial, Senate Democrats pressed on Sunday for a bipartisan rebuke
of the president's misconduct after the proceedings are over, but
some Republicans called the measure politically self-serving and
vowed to fight it.
</P>
<P>
-- The American counterattack on Osama bin Laden, the suspected
mastermind of the attacks on two American embassies, has only made
him a bigger hero in the Islamic world, officials say.
</P>
<P>
The Wall Street Journal
</P>
<P>
-- BMW's chairman resigned and was succeeded by the company's
little-known production chief, Joachim Milberg. The management
shake-up is leading to talk that the German luxury-car maker could
be the industry's next candidate for a sale or a link with a
larger company.
</P>
<P>
-- Wireless-phone sales surged 51 percent last year to a record
162.9 million units world-wide, and Nokia took the lead in the
market from Motorola, according to Dataquest Inc.

<HEADLINE> ADB Approves 37M Dollar Loan for Conservation of </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DHAKA, February 8 (Xinhua) -- The Asian Development Bank (ADB)
Monday approved 37 million U.S. dollars as loan for conservation
of biodiversity in the Sundarbans, the largest mangrove forest in
the world, the official BSS news agency reported.
</P>
<P>
With 6,000 square kilometers mangrove forest, the Sundarbans
provides subsistence living to 3.5 million people, offers
protection from cyclones in southwest Bangladesh, and is rich in
biodiversity and natural resources.
</P>
<P>
A globally significant ecosystem, the Sundarbans contains
habitats for fish, shrimp, bird and other wildlife, including the
largest remaining population of the highly endangered Bengal
tigers.
</P>
<P>
The World Heritage Committee of the UNESCO (the United Nations
Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization) last year
designated the mangrove forest for inclusion in the world heritage
list under its natural heritage criteria.
</P>
<P>
The ADB loan will come from the bank's Asian Development Fund,
which is interest-free and repayable in 40 years with a grace
period of 10 years, and it carries a service charge of one percent
per annum, the ADB was quoted as saying in a release.
</P>
<P>
The project will introduce modern management system which will
involve all stake-holders in the 17 sub-districts around the
forest.
</P>
<P>
"The participatory system will conserve and manage the forest
and its bio-diversity as a multi-dimensional resource," the ADB
stated.
</P>
<P>
The resources of the forest are being depleted through
increasing use by commercial wood processors, rural communities
bordering the forest and subsistence fisher-folk from the Bay of
Bengal, the ADB observed.
</P>
<P>
Besides, the ADB is also providing a technical assistance grant
of 0.57 million dollars to determine future options.
</P>
<P>
The total project cost is 82.2 million dollars, and apart from
the ADB's loan, financing will be provided by the Bangladeshi
government.

<HEADLINE> World-wide Sales of Wireless Phones Rise Sharply </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, February 8 (Xinhua) -- The sales of wireless phones
reached a record 162.9 million units world-wide last year, a 51
percent increase from 107.8 million units in 1997, a report
released by Dataquest Inc. said.
</P>
<P>
The closely watched industry think tank also said that
Finland's Nokia Corp. scored the biggest gains last year, taking
the top market-share position from Motorola Inc. of the United
States.
</P>
<P>
The report from Dataquest Inc. didn't include the dollar value
of those sales. But the Wall Street Journal on Monday quoted
analysts as saying that a typical wireless phone has a wholesale
price of slightly more than 170 U.S. dollars, valuing the market
at more than 27.7 billion dollars last year.
</P>
<P>
The Dataquest report said Nokia sold 37.4 million handsets last
year, or 23 percent of the market, up 82 percent from 20.6 million
units, a 19 percent share, in 1997.
</P>
<P>
Motorola sold 32.3 million units for a 20 percent share, up 28
percent from 25.3 million units, or a 23.5 percent share, in 1997.
Sweden's Telefon AB L.M. Ericsson was third, with 23.8 million
wireless handsets sold, a 15 percent share, up 50 percent from
15.9 million units, or 15 percent of the market.
</P>
<P>
Ericsson's vice president of marketing Jan Ahrenbring said his
company expects more than 200 million handsets to be sold this
year.

<HEADLINE> Beijing Permits Outdoor Ads In Commercial Areas </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, February 8 (Xinhua) - Neon lights ads are banned from
buildings along Beijing's Chang'an Avenue from Fuxingmen to
Jianguomen and through Tian'anmen Square, because many important
buildings are located there, but in some busy commercial areas,
advertising is not prohibited.
</P>
<P>
Vice-mayor Wang Guangtao told a press conference at the 2nd
session of the 11th Municipal People's Congress today that Beijing
has drafted advertising regulations and prohibitions and neon
signs will be removed from more than 500 buildings and 300 boards
on Chang'an.
</P>
<P>
The clean-up project is aimed at transforming chang'an into a
"serious, simple, graceful and harmonious" thoroughfare, according
to official sources.
</P>
<P>
Wang said that air pollution controls Beijing announced last
year have not entirely worked but are part of a strategy to
fundamentally improve the environment in Beijing and this will go
forward step by step.
</P>
<P>
Overall, its air quality is good, but pollution is serious in
the downtown areas, Wang said, with major pollutants being
suspended particles, sulphur dioxides, and nitrous oxides.
</P>
<P>
Coal is a major cause of pollution in Beijing, which is the No.
1 coal-burning capital in the world with an annual coal
consumption of 28 million tons.
</P>
<P>
There are also 1.4 million vehicles there. To curb pollution,
Beijing last year stepped up efforts to promote the use of high-
quality coal and clean fuels and to control auto emissions.
</P>
<P>
This has already shown some positive effects, as the content of
sulphur dioxides and nitrogen oxides in air has declined by more
than 10 percent since December, according to Wang.

<P>
HONG KONG, February 8 (Xinhua) -- Hong Kong government's
Principal Assistant Secretary for Security Miss Cathy Chu Monday
made it very clear to Father Franco Mella and two representatives
of the two-way permit holders claiming the right of abode in Hong
Kong have to leave before expiry of their limit of stay.
</P>
<P>
Otherwise, they are overstayers subject to removal in
accordance with law and established procedures, Miss Chu said.
</P>
<P>
This was confirmed by a Security Bureau spokesman in response
to media inquiries.
</P>
<P>
With regard to their request that overstayers should be allowed
to remain in Hong Kong pending the announcement of the new
Certificate of Entitlement (C of E) application procedures, Miss
Chu said that the Court of Final Appeal had ruled that persons
eligible for right of abode in Hong Kong have to apply for and
hold a C of E before they could enter and remain in Hong Kong as
permanent residents. C of E applications must be submitted in the
Chinese mainland, not in Hong Kong. Their request could not be
acceded to.
</P>
<P>
Miss Chu said that the new C of E application procedures would
be announced once they have been finalized. In this connection,
the Director of Immigration would visit the Bureau of Exit-entry
Administration, the Public Security Bureau shortly to discuss
details of how C of E could be applied for in the Chinese mainland.

<HEADLINE> Israeli Likud Party Begins Primary on Schedule </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, February 8 (Xinhua) -- Israeli ruling Likud Party
began the primary on schedule Monday to select candidates for the
Knesset (parliament).
</P>
<P>
Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu had considered
postponing the primary because he and President Erez Weizman
should lead a large Israeli delegation to attend the funeral of
Jordanian King Hussein Monday.
</P>
<P>
Hussein died Sunday after losing a seven-month battle against
lymphatic cancer.
</P>
<P>
But Netanyahu decided later to go ahead with the primary as
planned after seeking advice from Likud's legal experts.
</P>
<P>
Likud election committee chief Judge Uri Strausman and Likud
legal advisor Eitan Haberman said the Likud's constitution did
not provide any ground for postponing the vote.
</P>
<P>
The 2,700-member Likud central committee will select 87
candidates for the Likud list. Those, who win top places on the
list, will have chances to have seats in the next Knesset.
</P>
<P>
The Knesset elections will be held on May 17 this year.
</P>
<P>
The voting of the Likud primary began at noon and the results
are expected to be released at night.

<HEADLINE> SKorea Urged to Create Conditions for North-South Dialogue </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PYONGYANG, February 8 (Xinhua) -- The Democratic People's
Republic of Korea (DPRK) on Monday welcomed South Korea's positive
response to high-level talks proposed by Pyongyang but insisted
Seoul should fulfill certain preconditions.
</P>
<P>
"The future of the North-South dialogue entirely depends on the
whether the priorities are carried out or not," the Korean Central
News Agency (KCNA) quoted a spokesman for the Committee for the
Peaceful Reunification of the Fatherland as saying.
</P>
<P>
"If the priorities are carried out, the inter-Korean dialogue
may be held at any time," the spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
In an open letter delivered last Wednesday to the South Korean
authorities and political parties, the DPRK proposed to hold "high
level political talks" with South Korea in the second half of this
year.
</P>
<P>
The proposed talks would deal with peace, national unity, the
prevention of war and national unification, the reunion of
separated families and inter-Korean cooperation and exchanges, the
KCNA said.
</P>
<P>
However, the DPRK said the talks could be held only after South
Korea implemented preconditions set by Pyongyang in the first half
of the year.
</P>

<HEADLINE> Philippines Unveils New Tax Rules for Revenue Hike </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, February 8 (Xinhua) -- The Philippine government Monday
unveiled new tax rules in a bid to raise revenue collections and
curb corruption.
</P>
<P>
The government will exempt qualified taxpayers from being
audited and investigated if they pay "for taxable year 1998, an
increment of at least 20 percent of what they paid for 1997,"
Finance Secretary Edgardo Espiritu said in a news briefing.
</P>
<P>
After that, the taxpayer will be issued a certificate of
qualification, which will exempt him from a tax audit and
investigation for the taxable year, he said.
</P>
<P>
The new tax regulation aims to encourage taxpayers to
voluntarily declare and pay higher taxes and will reduce the
administrative costs on investigations, he said.
</P>
<P>
It could reduce fiscal leakages by encouraging taxpayers to pay
to the coffers of the government rather than to fill the pockets
of unscrupulous revenue officials, he added.

<HEADLINE> Estrada Vows Campaign Against Smuggling </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, February 8 (Xinhua) -- Philippine President Joseph
Estrada said Monday that his administration will relentlessly
pursue its crackdown against smuggling that has deprived the state
coffers of millions in revenues.
</P>
<P>
"I have given priority to hunting down tax evaders. These
include smugglers as well as their accomplices in government," he
said at the celebration of the 97th founding anniversary of the
Bureau of Customs.
</P>
<P>
He said the bureau should continue instituting reforms to
strengthen its revenue collection, cultivate a positive public
image, and assume its new role in the era of global
competitiveness.
</P>
<P>
To emphasize his point, Estrada led the burning of fake
cigarettes contained in five 40-foot container vans recently
seized by customs agents.
</P>
<P>
Acting Customs Commissioner Nelson Tan said the burning of the
cigarettes showed the President's resolve to protect the local
industry from unfair trade practices and eradicate smuggling.
</P>
<P>
Estrada said he expects the customs bureau to help him carry
out his pledge of raising the living standards of poor Filipinos
by intensifying its revenue collections and weeding out corruption
from its ranks.
</P>
<P>
The bureau has managed to meet its 78-billion-peso
(1.95-billion-U.S. dollar) collection target in 1997 despite a
30-percent fall in the volume of imports due to the Asian currency
crisis.

<P>
WASHINGTON, February 8 (Xinhua) -- The following are major news
items in leading U.S. newspapers on Monday.
</P>
<P>
The Washington Post:
</P>
<P>
-- Jordanian King Hussein's death was felt around the globe as
scores of foreign leaders and dignitaries made plans to attend his
funeral Monday. "I mourn the loss of a partner and friend,"
President Bill Clinton said before departing for Amman accompanied
by three former presidents -- George Bush, Jimmy Carter and Gerald
Ford.
</P>
<P>
-- No matter what the personal abilities of Jordan's new king
Abdullah, he may be too preoccupied with consolidating his rule at
home and a host of thorny domestic problems to plunge quickly or
publicly into the thicket of regional politics.
</P>
<P>
The New York Times:
</P>
<P>
-- Fast approaching the end of President Clinton's impeachment
trial, Senate Democrats pressed on Sunday for a bipartisan rebuke
of the president's misconduct after the proceedings are over, but
some Republicans called the measure politically self-serving and
vowed to fight it.
</P>
<P>
-- The American counterattack on Osama bin Laden, the suspected
mastermind of the attacks on two American embassies, has only made
him a bigger hero in the Islamic world, officials say.
</P>
<P>
The Wall Street Journal
</P>
<P>
-- BMW's chairman resigned and was succeeded by the company's
little-known production chief, Joachim Milberg. The management
shake-up is leading to talk that the German luxury-car maker could
be the industry's next candidate for a sale or a link with a
larger company.
</P>
<P>
-- Wireless-phone sales surged 51 percent last year to a record
162.9 million units world-wide, and Nokia took the lead in the
market from Motorola, according to Dataquest Inc.

BONN, February 8 (Xinhua) -- United States Defense Secretary
William Cohen said Monday that NATO troops would only be deployed
in Kosovo as peacekeepers and not to impose any settlement on the
war-torn Serbian province.
</P>
<P>
"We will be there to keep the peace, not to make the peace",
Cohen said after talking with his German counterpart Rudolf
Scharping.
</P>
<P>
"None of us contemplate entering a non-permissive environment,"
he said.
</P>
<P>
Cohen said before any decision could be made on NATO troops,
there had to first be a firm peace agreement between the Yugoslav
government and the province's ethnic Albanians who are fighting
for independence.
</P>
<P>
"We do not want to see a situation in which NATO forces
committed to the region are only ... an excuse for one or more
parties to take advantage and exploit (the situation)," said Cohen.
</P>
<P>
Both Cohen and Scharping declined to say how big the Kosovo
force would be or how it would be armed. Cohen underscored that
European members of NATO would have to supply most of the ground
troops.

<HEADLINE> Shanghai Introduces China's First Fire Alarm System </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHANGHAI, February 8 (Xinhua) -- Shanghai launched today a new
fire alarm system, similar to that of weather forecasts, to give
daily reports on the possibility of fire outbreaks.
</P>
<P>
The system uses a combination of alarms, meteorology, and
computers to rate fires by five categories: very likely, likely,
possible, not likely, and almost impossible. It monitors wind
force and direction, temperature, humidity, and rainfall.
</P>
<P>
According to the Shanghai Municipal Central Meteorology Center,
some 7,000 fires take place in the city every year and weather
conditions play an major role for the fires.
</P>
<P>
Analysts have concluded after analyzing meteorological
conditions during 2,798 of the fires that conflagrations are
likely to occur when the relative humidity is below 30 percent,
the average wind speed is above three meters per second, and
temperatures are above 12 centigrade.
</P>
<P>
From November 1 to 25 of last year, it was relatively dry,
temperatures were three degrees higher than normal and the
relatively humidity was below 40 percent. There were 32 fire
alarms each day during that period, well above the average of 19
per day for the whole year.
</P>
<P>
Officials said that the alarm system will help people be more
aware of fires and allow them to take steps to prevent possible
conflagrations.

CAIRO, February 8 (Xinhua) -- Egypt on Sunday expressed concern
over the renewal of fighting between Eritrea and Ethiopia for
control of border areas.
</P>
<P>
A statement issued by the Foreign Ministry expressed fear that
the fighting would affect the stability of the Horn of Africa.
</P>
<P>
The statement urged the two countries to resolve their disputes
through peaceful means in a bid to fend off further deterioration
of the situation.
</P>
<P>
It reiterated Egypt's support for all endeavors exerted to
settle the conflict peacefully within the framework of the
Organization of African Unity (OAU).
</P>
<P>
Armed conflicts broke out Saturday between Eritrean and
Ethiopian troops in the Badme area on the border.
</P>
<P>
Fightings broke out between the two countries for the
sovereignty of several disputed border areas last May. Mediated by
the world community under the framework of the OAU, the two
neighbors reached a ceasefire in June.

<HEADLINE> Mozambique Produced 91,000 Tons of Cotton in 1998 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MAPUTO, February 8 (XInhua) -- Erasmo Muhate, head of the
Mozambique Cotton Institute, said here Monday that the country's
cotton output in the 1997/98 (by June 30, 1998) agricultural year
registered 91,000 tons, surpassing the estimated 80,000 tons, and
became a record high since the country's independence in 1975.
</P>
<P>
The highest record was made in 1973 when the cotton output
reached 142, 000 tons, said Muhate. Later, the output was down to
10,000 tons in 1986 due to the civil war. Since 1993 when the
country achieved peace, the production caught up gradually and
restored to 77,000 tons in 1996/97.
</P>
<P>
The official revealed that the cotton output for 1998/99 has
been set at 100,000 tons, which he believed is very difficult to
realize.
</P>
<P>
He cited the drought in northern Nampula and Cabo Delgado
provinces whose output account for 80 percent of the country's
total, and the cholera epidemic in the area which has put farmers
to panic.
</P>
<P>
Another reason is the decreased international cotton price,
which has affected farmers' initiative.
</P>
<P>
According to Muhate, the 91,000 raw cotton could produce about
30,000 tons of cotton fibre. However, only 8000 tons of cotton
fibre had been sold in the past four months, which poses serious
loss to cotton companies.

<HEADLINE> People's Complaints Must Be Heard: Zhu Rongji </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, February 8 (Xinhua) -- Premier Zhu Rongji said that
greater attention must be paid to the work to handle people's
complaints.
</P>
<P>
He made the remark during a recent inspection of the bureaus of
the general offices of the Communist Party of China Central
Committee and of the State Council that deal with complaints from
the people.
</P>
<P>
The letters and calls of the people are an important channel
for the CPC and the government to develop democracy, accept
supervision and maintain close ties with the people, he said.
</P>
<P>
"This enables us to understand the process of policy
implementation, policy effectiveness, and to improve and revise
policies," and it helps to expose bureaucracy, rule violations,
and corruption, he explained.
</P>
<P>
Party committees and governments at all levels need to increase
their understanding of this work and to pay close attention to
letters and calls from the people and leading officials should
directly participate in dealing with these complaints and meet
with people, he said.
</P>
<P>
Those cases that need to be investigated should be handed over
to concerned departments and must not be brushed aside, he
emphasized, and an effort needs to be made in encouraging people
to use legal means to get their complaints handled.
</P>
<P>
Official statistics show that the two bureaus handled 460,000
complaints in 1998, more than half of which were about problems in
the countryside.
</P>
<P>
Some financial institutions like urban and rural credit
cooperatives and local commercial banks have accepted deposits
with high interest rates and extended loans in violation of rules
since the second half of last year, resulting in repayment
difficulties and bank runs, Zhu pointed out.
</P>
<P>
These problems must be dealt with seriously and steps need to
be taken to ensure repayment of people's savings to safeguard
social stability, he said.

<HEADLINE> Philippine Leaders Mourn King Hussein's Demise </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, February 8 (Xinhua) -- Philippine President Joseph
Estrada Monday joined the international community in mourning the
death of King Hussein of Jordan, calling him a "dear and true
friend of the Filipino people."
</P>
<P>
"It is with great sadness that I learned of the demise of His
Majesty, King Hussein bin Talal," Estrada said in a statement.
</P>
<P>
He said the world lost a "great leader, statesman and
peacemaker."
</P>
<P>
Estrada said King Hussein showed his "benevolence in opening
the doors of Jordan to facilitate the evacuation of Filipino
overseas workers from Kuwait and Iraq during the Gulf War in
1991."
</P>
<P>
"On behalf of the government and people of the Republic of the
Philippines, I have the honor to convey our sincere condolences
and sympathies to His Majesty, King Abdullah bin Hussein, the
members of the Royal Family and the Jordanian people on this
trying moment and join them in grief and prayer," Estrada said.
</P>
<P>
Blas F. Ople, president pro tempore of the Senate of the
Philippines paid tribute to King Hussein not only as a "man of
peace" but also as a "close friend to Filipino overseas workers."
</P>
<P>
Presidential Spokesman Jerry Barican said: "we are confident
that his legacy of peace will further be enhanced by his son King
Abdullah. We are looking forward to the strengthening of our
bilateral relations with Jordan under the reign of King Abdullah."
</P>
<P>
Philippine Ambassador to Jordan Ruperto Dizon will represent
Estrada in the monarch's funeral.
</P>
<P>
King Hussein died on Sunday shortly after returning to his
homeland following a failed treatment for cancer in the United
States.

<HEADLINE> Malaysia Considering Proposals for Raising Cash </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUALA LUMPUR, February 8 (Xinhua) -- Malaysia is looking into
proposals by foreign fund managers to help raise cash in Europe to
finance the country's financial sector and corporate restructuring
programs, First Finance Minister Daim Zainuddin said Monday.
</P>
<P>
The government would consider such proposals as long as they
are commercial transactions, Daim said at a closed-door forum for
fund managers here, according to the National economic Action
Council which released Daim's speech and a summary of his
questions and answers at the forum.
</P>
<P>
Malaysia's stand is to borrow from where rates are cheapest,
and so far Japan has offered cheap rates, said Daim who is also
Special Functions Minister.
</P>
<P>
Malaysia has secured a loan of 300 million U.S. dollars from
Export-Import Bank of Japan and a loan of 560 million U.S. dollars
from Sumitomo Bank of Japan.
</P>
<P>
Daim said earlier that 62 billion ringgit (about 16.315 billion
U.S. dollars) are required for Malaysia' economic recovery
throughout 1998-2000.

<HEADLINE> Australian Dollar Lifted by New Zealand Dollar </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, February 8 (Xinhua) -- A rally in the New Zealand
dollar lifted the Australian dollar after a morning dip and kept
it above 65 U.S. cents as the currency continued to ride last
week's wave of optimism about world growth prospects.
</P>
<P>
The New Zealand dollar gained after the Reserve Bank of New
Zealand (RBNZ) announced Monday morning it would introduce an
official cash rate in its monetary policy decisions.
</P>
<P>
Its rise checked early weakness in the Australian dollar, after
it touched a low of 64.99 U.S. cents in early trading.
</P>
<P>
"The main feature was the alteration ... in New Zealand which
sent the Kiwi soaring and that had a positive effect on the
Aussie," Westpac chief foreign exchange dealer Peter McGrath said.
</P>
<P>
The Australian dollar closed here at 65.28 U.S. cents from
65.20 late Friday. It reached a high for the day of 65.35 U.S.
cents.
</P>
<P>
At the close here the local currency was buying 73.90 Japanese
yen from 72.73 and 0.5808 euro from 0.5734.
</P>
<P>
McGrath said the Australian dollar is consolidating at the top
end of the recent range.
</P>
<P>
"It is holding up remarkably well considering there doesn't
seem to be too many fundamentals to support it at this stage,
certainly from the commodity front," he said.
</P>
<P>
Dealers said a turnaround in the sentiment about the Australian
economy by international investors continued to support the
Australian dollar.

<HEADLINE> Nigeria to Bring Liberian President to Book: </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, February 8 (Xinhua) -- Nigeria may shortly drag Liberian
 President Charles Taylor before the International Court of
Justice over his support for the Sierra Leonean rebels, Nigerian
Foreign Minister Ignatius Olisemeka has said.
</P>
<P>
The minister stated that his government had acquired all legal
instruments needed to put the Liberian leader on trial for war
crimes when he received an award for excellent service to Nigeria
in Lagos Sunday.
</P>
<P>
The Guardian newspaper Monday quoted Olisemeka as saying that
details of the procedure are already being worked out, adding that
"we shall teach him (Taylor) a lesson and very soon we shall do
that."
</P>
<P>
"As far as we are concerned, he has not shown any remorse for
his action.
</P>
<P>
What he has done is only to back his support with constant
denials," the minister noted.
</P>
<P>
Olisemeka denied reports that the rebels in Sierra Leone were
holding out in capital Freetown to fight the west African
peacekeeping force known as ECOMOG.
</P>
<P>
The Sierra Leonean foreign minister told him by telephone
Saturday that ECOMOG troops had commenced a mass operation to weed
out the rebels in the capital's suburbs, he added.
</P>
<P>
The minister assured that ECOMOG troops would in a matter of
days flush out the remnants of Sierra Leonean rebels still lurking
in capital Freetown.
</P>
<P>
The Nigerian government has repeatedly accused Liberian
President Taylor of supporting the rebels in Sierra Leone with
logistic support as well as military training and has recently
commenced documentation of atrocities allegedly perpetrated by the
Liberian leader.
</P>
<P>
It was learnt that the documentation, when completed, would be
submitted to relevant world bodies like the United Nations, the
Commonwealth and the Organization of African Unity with a view to
bringing him to book.
</P>
<P>
Sierra Leonean Chief of Defense Staff Brig. Gen. Amxwell Khobe
who is on a visit to Nigeria said last week that Taylor had
charged one of his ministers with the responsibility of providing
the rebels' needs.
</P>
<P>
Taylor also created a training field at Camp Shelfling for the
recruitment and training of fighters for Sierra Leone under the
guise that he is training them for immigration services, Khobe
added.

<HEADLINE> Assad Attends King Hussein's Funeral </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
AMMAN, February 8 (Xinhua) -- Syrian President Hafez Assad
Monday attended the funeral of Jordan's King Hussein though their
bilateral relations remain cool.
</P>
<P>
Assad made the surprise decision known shortly before his
departure from Damascus.
</P>
<P>
This will be the first time he is present at a state event
along with leaders of Israel, which took the Golan Heights in the
1967 Middle East war.
</P>
<P>
Hussein died Sunday morning at the age of 63 after losing a
seven-month battle against lymphatic cancer. Assad and Hussein had
been at odds ever since the king signed a peace accord with Israel
in 1994.
</P>
<P>
Peace negotations between Syria and Israel have been stalled
since 1996 when a general election in Israel brought the
right-wing Likud Party to power.
</P>
<P>
Syria wants the return of the entire Golan in making peace with
Israel, while the Israeli government under Benjamin Netanyahu
refused to cede even an inch.
</P>
<P>
Assad's attendance at Hussein's funeral is regarded as an
important gesture in improving relations between the two Arab
neighbors and forging unity among Muslims.
</P>
<P>
Previously Syria had declared a three-day mourning period for
the king.
</P>
<P>
Assad also postponed a referendum on presidential election from
Monday to Wednesday to skip the mourning period. He is expected to
serve a fifth seven-year term as president.
</P>
<P>
Hundreds of prominent figures from the world are attending the
majestic funeral of Hussein, who was the longest reigning monarch
in the region and the staunch advocate for peace.

<HEADLINE> Shell Company Restructures Operations in Nigeria </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, February 8 (Xinhua) -- The Shell Petroleum Development
Company of Nigeria has been forced to restructure its operations
in Nigeria because of the low crude oil prices and recurrent
crisis in oil producing area of the Niger Delta, southern Nigeria.
</P>
<P>
The Shell company, the biggest oil producer in the country, may
lay off as much as 20 to 25 percent of its work force from its
4,500 permanent staff and some 10,000 contract workers, This Day
newspaper reported Monday.
</P>
<P>
A company official told the paper that like all other
multi-nationals, his company was being compelled to downsize
because of low oil prices at the international oil market.
</P>
<P>
In addition, he said, the persistent disruptions of its
operations in Niger Delta by the warring Ijaw factions had caused
his company untold losses both in revenues and equipment.
</P>
<P>
The official said the company was being forced to cut back
crude output from its operations by some 100,000 to 150,000
barrels per day (b/d) in the oil producing area as continuous
threats to its facilities and the lives of its personnel persist.
</P>
<P>
At the end of 1997, Shell was producing 950,000 b/d and the
volume had to be slashed to 850,000 b/d by the second quarter of
last year as the company had to comply with cut-backs to Nigeria's
production ceiling by the Organization of Petroleum Exporting
Countries (OPEC).
</P>
<P>
At present, the company is no longer able to meet its
production figure of 850,000 b/d because of the continuous Niger
Delta crisis in which the local warring factions hold the company
hostage as a way of expressing their grievances to the Nigerian
government.
</P>
<P>
But, Shell, in order not to lose its market share to other oil
companies, has decided to adopt an aggressive development strategy
for its offshore deep water blocks in the west African country.

<P>
BEIRUT, February 8 (Xinhua) -- Two members of the Israeli
allied South Lebanon Army (SLA) were wounded Monday in south
Lebanon in a guerrilla attack, security sources said.
</P>
<P>
They were slightly hurt in a Lebanese guerrillas' artillery and
heavy-machine gun attack on a SLA post in Soujoud, a hill on the
verge of the Israeli-occupied border zone in south Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
In Beirut, the Iranian-backed Hezbollah, or Party of God,
claimed responsibility for the attack.
</P>
<P>
On Saturday, A Hezbollah roadside bomb killed a SLA officer
and wounded another, prompting an SLA retaliatory shelling on
villages inside the zone.
</P>
<P>
A total of 15 Lebanese civilians and three United Nations
peacekeepers serving in the south were wounded during the Saturday
attack.
</P>
<P>
Israel set up a self-declared security zone in south Lebanon in
1985 with the claimed aim of protecting its north from Lebanese
guerrillas' cross-border attacks.
</P>
<P>
Since then, Lebanese resistance movement spearheaded by
Hezbollah has been fighting to oust Israeli occupation forces and
its allies out of the country.

<HEADLINE> Ethiopia Destroys Eritrean Radar Station: </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ADDIS ABABA, February 8 (Xinhua) -- The office of Ethiopian
government spokesperson announced Monday that the Ethiopian forces
have destroyed an Eritrean radar station in the second day
fighting at the northern border areas.
</P>
<P>
A statement issued Monday morning by the office said, "on
February 7 at 05:45 p.m., Ethiopian forces using heavy artillery
demolished an Eritrean radar station in an unpopulated area five
kilometers southeast of Adi Quala."
</P>
<P>
Personnel supervising the station sustained casualties, said
the statement, adding that the fighting continues at the
Badme-Sheraro front.
</P>

Meanwhile, Eritrea said Ethiopian army units, backed by
helicopter gunships and fighter aircraft, attacked Eritrean
positions on a second front Monday.

<HEADLINE> Interview: Thai Minister Says SMEs Vital for </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, February 8 (Xinhua) -- As small and medium-sized
enterprises (SMEs) in Thailand are playing an indispensable role
in the economic recovery, the government will extend all necessary
support for their development, Industry Minister Suwat Liptapanlop
said on Monday.
</P>
<P>
He said the ministry has proposed a draft SME Promotion Act,
under which there will be fund that can be used to finance a wide
range of public and private sector projects related to SME
development, including those in the trade and service sectors.
</P>
<P>
Venture capital is another instrument being considered to
provide equity funding to strategic SMEs, he said in an interview
with Xinhua.
</P>
<P>
There are about 130,000 SMEs in Thailand accounting for 98
percent of all registered factories. These SMEs employ 1.6 million
workers, or 50 percent of the industrial workforce.
</P>
<P>
The financial crisis, broke out in July 1997, took a heavy toll
on the SMEs, which are cash-strapped and unable to obtain loans
from the commercial banks.
</P>
<P>
The government will support the SMEs, particularly in the field
of technological innovation, by providing long-term, low-interest
loans for research and development projects of the private sector.
</P>
<P>
The loans also cover expenses in implementing process
improvements based on the research and development results.
</P>
<P>
"Currently, a fund for technological innovations is being
established," the minister said.
</P>
<P>
Under Thailand's Industrial Restructuring Plan, loans will be
provided to firms for upgrading machinery, process improvement,
etc. Firms are encouraged to make use of export consultancy, with
the expenses partly funded by the government.

<HEADLINE> Interview: Thai Minister Says SMEs Vital for </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In addition, the Stock Exchange of Thailand is currently
establishing a capital market for SMEs, with terms and conditions
that are more appropriate for smaller enterprises.
</P>
<P>
"One key factor for success is the proper and transparent
business practice especially accounting practice by SMEs," he
said.
</P>
<P>
"The Ministry of Industry has an important role to play in
strengthening and enhancing the management and technological
capabilities of SMEs preparing to enter such capital market," he
said.
</P>
<P>
As for how the government deals with bankrupt enterprises and
helps such enterprises merge, the minister said: "First and
foremost emphasis" is placed on helping enterprises survive the
economic crisis through debt restructuring and corporate
restructuring.
</P>
<P>
"To help facilitate debt restructuring negotiations between
banks and the borrowers, the government has issued directive to
provincial authorities to establish intermediary committee."
</P>
<P>
"In case where merging is necessary, the government provides a
measure to help lessen the financial burden by waiving taxes on
the transfer of assets," the minister said.
</P>
<P>
He also talked about how SMEs cope with the liquidity crunch,
saying firms have been adopting changes in their business plans
and debt structure.
</P>
<P>
He quoted a recent survey as saying that non-exporting SMEs are
more concerned about and affected by the fall in domestic
consumption than by liquidity problem. Some firms have begun to
explore exporting opportunities.
</P>
<P>
Falling domestic market demands have also led to cut-down in
production, and some firms attempt to reduce their fixed costs,
such as wages by reducing the work hours.
</P>
<P>
"The government is keenly aware of the liquidity problem,
especially the weariness of commercial banks in lending to SMEs,"
Suwat said.
</P>
<P>
The Ministry of Industry and the Ministry of Finance, in
consultation with specialized financial institutions, have jointly
allocated 35 billion baht (970 million U.S. dollars) in loans for
SMEs in 1999.
</P>
<P>
There is also an additional scheme by the Industry Ministry in
cooperation with Krung Thai Bank for 10 billion baht (277.8
million dollars) to be lent to SMEs which participate in the
ministry's rural industry development and entrepreneurship
development projects.
</P>
<P>
Another key approach to build confidence of the banks is to
strengthen the financial institutions' ability in appraising
projects and performance of the borrowing firms, and in providing
business advisory to clients.
</P>
<P>
The minister is not very satisfied with the technology-oriented
enterprises, saying they still depend very much on imported
technologies.
</P>
<P>
"There is still a need to strengthen the technology-absorption
capability of the industrial workforce. Our Industrial
Restructuring Plan emphasizes building up such capability, which
is the basis for subsequent technology adaptation and innovation,"
he said.

<HEADLINE> Japanese Business Delegation to Visit Bangladesh </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DHAKA, February 8 (Xinhua) -- A high-level Japanese business
delegation will arrive here soon to explore trade and investment
opportunities in Bangladesh, an English daily reported Monday.
</P>
<P>
The delegation will represent different big companies as well
as leaders of various Japanese chambers of commerce and industry,
the New Nation said.
</P>
<P>
The Japan Chambers of Commerce and Industry, the apex trade
body based in Tokyo, is sending the delegation in connection with
the forthcoming 10th meeting of the Japan-Bangladesh Joint
Committee for Commercial and Economic Cooperation, which is
scheduled to be held here on February 16.
</P>
<P>
Since Japan is the single largest donor to Bangladesh, the
forthcoming meeting is expected to play a significant role in
attracting large-scale Japanese investment in different sectors,
particularly for setting up small and medium-scale enterprises
under joint venture.
</P>
<P>
The meeting is likely to open up a new vista of cooperation and
lead to a further strengthening of the existing bilateral
relationship between the two countries, said an executive member
of the Federation of Bangladesh Chambers of Commerce and Industry
(FBCCI).
</P>
<P>
After the meeting, a seminar entitled "Development of Small and
Medium Enterprises in Bangladesh: Japan's Experience" will be held
on February 17.
</P>
<P>
Based on Japanese experiences and proposals, the FBCCI will
finally submit recommendations to the government to frame a
sustainable policy for the development of small and medium-scale
enterprises in the country in future in the context of
globalization and free market economy, the FBCCI executive member
said.

<HEADLINE> IMF Willing to Provide Additional Funds to Indonesia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, February 8 (Xinhua) -- The International Monetary Fund
(IMF) is willing to provide Indonesia with additional loans
outside its earlier package for the country to help it overcome
its current difficulties, an IMF official said here Monday.
</P>
<P>
The IMF realizes that Indonesia needs a greater amount of
financial assistance than earlier expected to finance its economic
reform programs and solve problems caused by the crisis, the
Fund's director for Asia Pacific, Hubert Neiss, told newsmen after
a three-hour meeting with President B.J. Habibie at the Merdeka
Palace.
</P>
<P>
However, Neiss did not specify the amount the IMF will give to
Indonesia.
</P>
<P>
The Additional assistance will still be discussed by the IMF
executive board, he said, adding that it would be announced to the
public by March when the letter of intent is scheduled to be
signed.
</P>
<P>
Under an agreement signed at the end of October 1997, the IMF
agreed to arrange a 43 billion U.S. dollars rescue package for
Indonesia. Of the package, 10 billion U.S. dollars was pledged by
the IMF and the rest by the World Bank, the Asian Development Bank
and friendly countries.
</P>
<P>
On the rupiah's (national currency) fluctuation against the
U.S. dollar, Neiss said it is no longer caused by economic factors
but by socio-political matters, including security problems.
</P>
<P>
"If the political stabilization goes steady and the economic
programs run well, the rupiah will strengthen," he added.
</P>
<P>
The rupiah dropped to the lowest level in May last year with
17,000 per dollar. It traded at 8,750/9100 per dollar on Monday,
more than 70 percent lower than that in July 1997 when the
regional monetary crisis started.
</P>
<P>
On the IMF's prediction of inflation during fiscal year
1999/2000 (starting on April 1) based on the state budget, he said
it is expected at only 10 percent.
</P>
<P>
Indonesia's inflation hit 70-80 percent last year, the highest
in 32 years.

profit-taking after last week's record gains.
</P>
<P>
The benchmark all ordinaries index closed 11.9 points lower at
2,900.0.
</P>
<P>
Leads in the broader market were flat with the U.S. market
little changed as it digested the potential for a rise in U.S.
interest rates, and recently favored Internet stocks continued to
lose some of their gloss.
</P>

A rise in domestic resource stocks following nearly a week of
rises in base metal prices in London with copper firm again last
Friday was not enough to hold the market up.
</P>
<P>
"There were not too many leads from offshore," Macquarie
Nevitts' Scott Mitchell said.
</P>
<P>
The Dow Jones industrial average ended down 0.26 points at
9,304.24 last Friday.

reweighting in the banking sector with a bias toward the
Commonwealth Bank and stocks, such as Foster's Brewing Group,
which released profit results.
</P>
<P>
The all industrials index sank 34.9 points to 5,250.9 while the
all resources lifted 10.6 to 966.8.

<P>
Among those reporting profits, Foster's shares gained four
cents, the beer, wine and leisure heavyweight announced a healthy
14 percent rise in first half year net profit.
</P>
<P>
Qantas Airways fell 10 cents and was near the top of the
turnover table with some 12.45 million shares changing hands.
</P>
<P>
In the banking sector the index fell 64.1 points to 6,586.7
points with three of the "Big Four" banking stocks weaker.
</P>
<P>
The Commonwealth Bank soared 19.5 cents, while National
Australia Bank plummeted 49.1 cents, Westpac shed 27 cents and ANZ
eased one cent.
</P>
<P>
Telecommunications shares fared no better.
</P>
<P>
Telstra dipped 10 cents, while Cable &AMP; Wireless Optus eased six
cents and AAPT fell one cent.
</P>
<P>
In the resources sector, diversified miner BHP ended 11 cents
higher, Rio Tinto found an extra 15 cents and WMC picked up 16.
</P>
<P>
In the gold sector the index finished the day seven points
lower at 1,072.2, the price of gold bullion in Sydney closed at
289.30 U.S. dollars per fine ounce after last Friday's close of
289.85.
</P>
<P>
National turnover was 387.37 million shares worth 981.25
million Australian dollars (639.7 million U.S. dollars), with
falling stocks outnumbering rising stocks 680 to 517. There were
414 stocks that remained steady.

<HEADLINE> Soeharto-led Foundations Turned Over to Govt: Minister </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, February 8 (Xinhua) -- Funds from seven foundations,
once chaired by Indonesian former president Soeharto, had been
turned over to the government, State Secretary/Minister Akbar
Tanjung said Monday.
</P>
<P>
"The president, through (Presidential) Decree No. 195/1998, has
appointed the coordinating minister for people's welfare and
poverty alleviation to coordinate the use of these funds," Tanjung
told a meeting with the House of Representatives' commission on
domestic and foreign political affairs.
</P>
<P>
Tanjung said the coordinating minister will be assisted by
experts in carrying out the programs of the seven foundations,
which amount to about 5.7 trillion rupiah (670 million U.S.
dollars).
</P>
<P>
The government has set up an independent commission led by the
attorney general to probe into alleged corruption cases involving
several foundations formerly chaired by Soeharto, who resigned in
May last year in the midst of massive unrest, student
demonstrations and a crippling economic crisis.
</P>
<P>
Soeharto and several figures, including former government
officials and his eldest daughter Siti Hardiyanti Rukmana, had
been questioned by the Attorney General's Office.
</P>
<P>
The seven foundations are Amal Bhakti Muslim Pancasila
Foundation, Dakab Foundation, Dharmais Foundation, Dana Sejahtera
Mandiri Foundation, Dana Gotong Royong Foundation, Trikora
Foundation and Supersemar Foundation.
</P>
<P>
Three of the foundations -- Supersemar, Dharmais and Trikora --
will provide scholarships to poor students and orphans and offer
free health services to orphanages. The other four foundations
will aim to empower poor families to improve their financial
status.

<HEADLINE> Myanmar to Cultivate Oil Palm, Rubber in S. Division </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
YANGON, February 8 (Xinhua) -- Myanmar leader General Maung Aye
has urged the country's entrepreneurs to cultivate oil palm and
rubber on commercial scale in Kawthoung and Myeik, the country's
southern Tanintharyi division.
</P>
<P>
Meeting the entrepreneurs in Kawthoung on Saturday, Maung Aye,
vice-chairman of the Myanmar State Peace and Development Council,
said there were few engaged in cultivation and production of crops
in the division, resulting in that supply of rice in the region is
inadequate.
</P>
<P>
Maung Aye, who is also deputy commander-in-chief of the Myanmar
Defense Services and Commander-in-Chief of the Army, said the
land, water and weather conditions of the division are appropriate
for cultivation of paddy as well as the perennial crops such as
oil palm and rubber.
</P>
<P>
He admitted that edible oil production in Myanmar is
insufficient and millions of dollars have to be spent for
importing palm oil.
</P>
<P>
He urged local entrepreneurs to establish edible oil palm
plantations and said the region would become the "edible oil pot"
of the country like central Magway division.
</P>
<P>
He also suggested perennial crop rubber be grown in places
where oil palm cannot be cultivated.
</P>
<P>
A Leading Committee for Development of Tanintharyi Division was
formed in March last year to gear up efforts for the regional
development.
</P>
<P>
According to official statistics, Myanmar imported 134.25
million U.S. dollars worth of edible vegetable oil and other
hydrogenated oil, and exported 22,000 tons of raw rubber in
1997-98 fiscal year.
</P>
<P>
Myanmar's agriculture accounts for 36 percent of the gross
domestic product and 35 percent of the export value.

<P>
SINGAPORE, February 8 (Xinhua) -- Share prices dropped sharply
on Singapore Stock Market Monday as investors were cautious going
into reporting season.
</P>
<P>
The benchmark Straits Times Index (STI) shed 23.30 points to
close at 1,336.88 points in thin trading.
</P>
<P>
The total volume decreased to 130.92 million units worth 235.47
million Singapore dollars (139.46 million U.S. dollars),
reflecting the depression on the market. Falls outstripped rises
by 235 to 36 with 150 shares unchanged.
</P>
<P>
SembCorp topped the actives chart of the day with 19.68 million
shares in volume. Eagle, a township enterprise in China and a
manufacturer of ceramic sanitary wares and tiles, was the second
heavily traded stock on its first day for transaction and
registered a turnover of 15.82 million units. ST Engg was next
with a volume of 5.91 million counters changing hands.
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
They said the prospect of bleak full-year figures has left
little encouragement for investors.
</P>
<P>
Concerns over a possible U.S. interest rate hike also dampened
the market sentiment, dealers added.

<TEXT>
<P>
MACAO, February 8 (Xinhua) -- Air Macao on Monday put into
operation a new Airbus-321 passenger plane, which was just
delivered to Macao Sunday night.
</P>
<P>
The 178-seat aircraft was the first one bought by the airline
which has been leasing seven Airbus planes since it started
business on November 9, 1995.
</P>
<P>
The new plane was scheduled to head for Taipei on its virgin
commercial flight.
</P>
<P>
Air Macao now runs 13 air routes which connect Macao with
cities including Bangkok, Manila, Beijing and Shanghai.
</P>
<P>
Latest statistics from Air Macao show that it handled more than
1.13 million passengers and 14,883 tons of cargo in 1998, an
increase of 14.4 percent and 36.2 percent respectively over the
previous year.
</P>
<P>
However, sources with the company noted that profits of Air
Macao for 1998 shrank six percent in comparison with that of 1997
due mainly to the devaluation of Taiwan's currency, for passengers
from or to Taiwan accounted for nearly 60 percent of the total.

that businessmen need to develop their business and trade activity.
</P>
<P>

<HEADLINE> Australian Defense Force Offers to Help Fix Y2K Problems </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, February 8 (Xinhua) -- The Australian Defense Force
(ADF) may be sent in if civilian computer systems crash because of
the millennium bug, the Australian Associated Press (AAP) reported
Monday.
</P>
<P>
Excepting helping regional defense forces tackle the looming
Year 2000 (Y2K) problem, the ADF is also willing to share their
experiences with friends in Southeast Asia, AAP said.
</P>
<P>
Addressing a defense conference on Y2K management in Darwin
Monday, Eric Abetz, parliamentary secretary to Defense Minister
John Moore, said a significant effort was required to ensure a
disaster did not occur.
</P>
<P>
"Our experiences and the expertise we have gained in dealing
with the year 2000 problems we have encountered in our defense
operational systems are ones we are happy to share with our
friends in South East Asia," Abetz told an audience of Australian
and regional defense representatives.
</P>
<P>
"We are all facing the same problems and in this world of
increasing globalization, it makes sense for us to face them
together."
</P>
<P>
Abetz said the ADF could have a role in correcting the effects
of crashed Australian civil computer systems through its national
disaster management agency, Emergency Management Australia (EMA).
</P>
<P>
He said an issue of critical national importance was ensuring
that essential services such as health, finance, transport, food
and utilities, including power, water, sewerage and
telecommunications, were not hit by Y2K problems.
</P>
<P>
"In Australia under our constitutional arrangements,
responsibility for dealing with any potential public safety
effects of Year 2000 failure rests with state and territory
emergency management authorities," he said.
</P>
<P>
"Defense through the national disaster management agency EMA
has established strong coordination links with states, territories
and local governments. Established national emergency management
arrangements, which have been extensively developed over many
years by these organizations, should be used for the Year 2000
event period."
</P>
<P>
The Year 2000 problem stems from early days of computers when
programmers abbreviated year dates to two digits.
</P>
<P>
Hence many computers may not recognize the change to 2000 as
computer clocks tick over to January 1.
</P>
<P>
Expected problems range from some minor inconvenience up to
collapse of major systems.

<HEADLINE> Germany to Help Raise Egypt's Cotton Yield </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, February 8 (Xinhua) -- Germany will help Egypt raise the
yield of cotton, its major traditional product for export, under a
bilateral cooperation program, German ambassador in Cairo Peter
Michael Dingens said.
</P>
<P>
According to the the Egyptian Gazette Monday, the ambassador
made the remark at the opening ceremony of a cotton processing
plant in Sakha, 140 kilometers north of Cairo on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
It is part of the German-Egyptian Technical Cooperation
program, which has four projects aimed at improving the
production, certification and marketing of cotton seeds, and the
modernization of the cotton sector in general, Dingens said.
</P>
<P>
The new plant, which was funded by the German government,
represented the efforts to provide cotton farmers with high
quality seeds to increase production and income, the newspaper
reported.
</P>
<P>
On the crucial importance of cotton production and export for
Egypt's economy, Dingens stressed that two principles are guiding
Germany and Egypt in their cooperation.
</P>
<P>
One is making Egypt's cotton sector and textile industry more
competitive in the international markets, and the other is
encouraging farmers to take part in the modernization process to
benefit from the success resulted from the 20-year bilateral
agricultural cooperation, the diplomat said.
</P>
<P>
Egypt is famous for its high quality cotton, with an annual
production of 940,000 tonnes, Cotton is one of the major
agricultural products for export.
</P>
<P>
Turning to the bilateral trade, Dingens said that cotton and
cotton products are Germany's key imports from Egypt.
</P>
<P>
Germany is the biggest trade partner of Egypt among the 15
European Union members. The bilateral trade volume stood at 2.33
billion U.S. dollars in 1997.
</P>
<P>
Germany is also Egypt's second largest aid provider after the
United States. Germany offered grants, loans and technical aid to
promote Egypt's development in various fields.

<HEADLINE> China's New Laws to Combat Illegal Trading in Ancient Relics </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, February 8 (Xinhua) -- China's cultural relics
administration will tighten controls on all aspects of relics
trading and collecting through the enforcement of tough new
regulations.
</P>
<P>
The State Administration of Cultural Heritage (SACH) announced
that revision of the Law on Cultural Relics Protection will be
completed this year, and regulations governing the management of
relics to be taken abroad, and standards for determining relics,
will also be amended.
</P>
<P>
Rules also will be drafted to bring private relic collections
under rational control, Zhang Wenbin, director of the SACH, told a
national meeting here today.
</P>
<P>
Zhang noted that private collections, which have been appearing
in China as a result of economic development, play a key role in
the country's relic protection work. However, illegal dealings in
relics must be combated.
</P>
<P>
He acknowledged that black-market relics dealing has become
rampant in some places, and that many historical relics and museum
collections have been auctioned off without permission due to
loose management.
</P>
<P>
A national system to regulate the determination and
registration of private collections will be set up, and auction
companies must be examined to ensure their qualifications for
dealing in cultural relics, Zhang said.
</P>
<P>
The government and museums will enjoy the privilege of
purchasing privately owned relics of great historic, scientific or
artistic significance, he added.
</P>
<P>
China has stipulated that relics that are to be taken abroad
must be no older than the year 1795, and some dating as late as
1911 must also be kept in China because of their rarity.
</P>
<P>
The SACH plans to launch a nationwide inspection of relics
markets and auctioneers this year by joining hands with police and
market-examination authorities. It also plans to enhance the
supervision of certain institutes and increase training for
personnel involved in determining which relics may be taken out of
the country.

<HEADLINE> Sri Lanka to Hold Five Provincial Elections </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
COLOMBO, February 8 (Xinhua) -- Sri Lanka's Commissioner of
Elections Monday announced that the country's five provincial
council polls will be held on April 1 this year.
</P>
<P>
Commissioner Dayananda Dissanayake said in a press release that
polling day was set for the Provincial Councils of Uva, Central,
North Central, Sabaragamuwa and Western.
</P>
<P>
The date of five provinces' poll was nullified last August
under Section 5 of the Public Security Ordinance.
</P>
<P>
Sri Lanka has nine provinces, of which Eastern and Northern
provinces do not have Provincial Council polls due to the
protracted civil war there since 1983 between the government and
Tamil rebels.
</P>
<P>
Sri Lanka's ruling People's Alliance won 30 seats out of 52 in
the bitterly contested North Western Provincial Council election
which was held on January 25 this year. The term of the Southern
Provincial Council has not yet expired.

<HEADLINE> China's B-Shares Market in Predicament: Analyst </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, February 8 (Xinhua) -- China's B-shares market, which
is reserved for overseas investors, has bearish over the past year,
with the B-shares index falling more than 50 percent, and total
trading at only one million U.S. dollars a day on average.
</P>
<P>
Jiang Guofang, deputy general manager of the Shanghai-based
Shenyin Wanguo Securities Co., attributes the B-shares decline on
the Shanghai and Shenzhen exchanges to the global financial
turmoil and some defects in the operation mechanism of the B-
shares markets.
</P>
<P>
Poor market liquidity is the major reason for the decline, as
the scale of the market is too small, Jiang said.
</P>
<P>
By the end of 1998, the market value of B-shares on the two
exchanges totaled 20 billion yuan (about 2.4 billion U.S. dollars))
, equivalent to only one percent of that of A-shares. At the same
time, the domination of some long-term investment funds has added
to poor stock liquidity, said Jiang.
</P>
<P>
Along with this, low profitability of the listed B-shares
companies and an underdeveloped information system have also
dampened the enthusiasm of overseas investors.
</P>
<P>
"The rejuvenation of the B-shares market is subject to the
recovery of the global economy and a better performance of the
domestic market." Jiang said.
</P>
<P>
"While global economic growth continues to slow, and the
financial situation has become more complicated since the launch
of the euro, there is little chance that international capital
will be reinjected into China in the near future to foster a
bullish stock market."
</P>
<P>
Jiang also called for the structural readjustment of the B-
shares market and improvement of regulatory mechanisms, which he
described as "the ultimate driving force behind the market."

<HEADLINE> Yellow River Pollution Affects Urban Water Supplies </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JINAN, February 8 (Xinhua) -- Urban water supplies in the lower
and middle reaches of the Yellow River have been adversely
affected by serious pollution resulting from wastewater discharges.
</P>
<P>
Chen Jinhao, director of the Shandong Yellow River Water
Resources Protection Bureau, noted that over 1,000 km of the 5,464-
km river is subject to heavy pollution, from Xiaolangdi, a key
water control project in central China's Henan Province, to the
river's estuary.
</P>
<P>
Pollution levels have hit the highest point in history,
according to Chen.
</P>
<P>
Water treatment facilities in some cities have been forced to
close, including the system that supplies drinking water to Jinan,
capital of Shandong Province. However, urban residents along the
river do not face a water crisis currently due to the storage
capacity of local reservoirs.
</P>
<P>
The large volume of wastewater flowing into the Yellow River
from tributaries, including the Weihe River in northwest Shaanxi
Province and the Fenhe River in Shanxi Province, has contributed
to the increasing pollution problem, according to a survey.
</P>
<P>
The Yellow River, which finds its source in northwest China's
Qinghai Province, is China's second longest river following the
Yangtze. The Yellow River meanders through seven provinces and two
autonomous regions before emptying into the Bohai Sea.

TIANJIN, February 8 (Xinhua) -- Nearly half of Tianjin's
exports, the largest port city in north China, came from Binhai
New District, a district official said here today.

<HEADLINE> Chinese Scientists Feed Waste Pulp To Livestock </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, February 8 (Xinhua) -- The liquid waste left over by
the paper making process has been used by Chinese scientists to
produce high-quality feed for livestock.
</P>
<P>
Scientists say that the waste water treatment technology can
even be used with sulfate pulping, a process not often used in
paper making that has been criticized by environmentalists for a
long time because of the pollution it causes.
</P>
<P>
Zhao Shilai, a professor at the Chinese University of
Agriculture, says that they used biotechnology to recover the
nutrients from the liquid waste and experiments showed that the
feed produced from it could replace corn and soy beans in some
livestock diets.
</P>
<P>
The Taiyuan Paper Mill in Shanxi province has got 50 million U.
S. dollars worth of investment from several enterprises to apply
the new technology and to build a paper-making and livestock-
raising industrial base.

<HEADLINE> Yunnan, Battle Front of China's War on Drug </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUNMING, February 8 (Xinhua) -- A truck was stopped at a border
inspection station in southwest China's Yunnan Province in a cold
and foggy morning. Police sensed a look of uneasiness on the
driver and ordered a search of his truck. This led to the seizure
of more than 300 kilograms of heroin, which was destined to Hong
Kong.
</P>
<P>
An average of 25 cases of drug trafficking are uncovered every
day along the province's 4,060-kilometer-long border with Myanmar,
Laos and Vietnam, the notorious drug-growing "Golden Triangle"
region encompassing the border areas of the three countries.
</P>
<P>
China's recent anti-drug campaign has reinforced this
southwestern area and has delivered a hard blow to drug dealers.
Yunnan took the lead in the country by setting up 17 drug-control
agencies last year, comprising 116 police squads made up of 2,000
people.
</P>
<P>
These units stopped the smuggling of 350 tons of chemicals used
in making drugs, and confiscated 6,184 kilograms of various drugs
last year, accounting for 75 percent of all the drugs seized in
China in 1998.
</P>
<P>
Sources with the drug control institution disclosed that some
27 anti-drug police officers have died in the line of duty and 207
others have been injured.
</P>
<P>
"It is the wisdom and blood of the police force that is
safeguarding our country's anti-drug line of defense." said Chen
Yahua, a woman frontier police officer.
</P>
<P>
Pino Arlacchi, head of the United Nations Drug Control Program,
said during his inspection tour of Yunnan at the end of last year
that he was deeply impressed by Yunnan's achievements in drug-
control and the rehabilitation of drug addicts.

<HEADLINE> Support for S. Africa's ANC at 1994 Level: Survey </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, February 8 (Xinhua) -- A recent survey has found
that support for South Africa's ruling African National Congress
(ANC) stands at 61 percent, which is very close to its 1994
election vote share, but short of a two-thirds majority.
</P>
<P>
Local media Monday quoted the Human Resources Research Council
(HSRC) as saying Sunday that while its survey showed the ANC had
retained its ground, there had been significant change in support
for other parties.
</P>
<P>
The biggest gains since 1994 were achieved by the United
Democratic Movement (UDM) and the Democratic Party (DP).
</P>
<P>
The HSRC said that this emerged from a comparison of the 1994
election results and the latest estimates of the HSRC's voting
model, based on a survey completed in early December last year.
</P>
<P>
"The rise of the UDM, launched in September 1997, and the DP
into contention for status of official opposition has been one of
the major developments in party politics since 1994," said the
HSRC.
</P>
<P>
In February 1998, the HSRC voting model placed the UDM's
support at about nine percent. Its December 1998 estimates
confirmed an almost identical level.
</P>
<P>
The DP more than tripled its backing since winning only 1.7
percent of the vote in 1994.
</P>
<P>
A large part of the gains by the UDM and the DP appears to be
at the expense of the New National Party (NP) and the Inkatha
Freedom Party (IFP). New NP support has dropped from just over 20
percent in the 1994 election to 12 percent. IFP support decreased
from 10.5 percent to three percent.

<HEADLINE> More Chinese Housewives Attracted to Dishwashers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, February 8 (Xinhua) -- As many Chinese now have more
spacious homes and larger kitchens, the dishwasher has become a
hot consumer, according to market analysts.
</P>
<P>
Though still a novelty to most Chinese families, the sales of
dishwashers jumped by several fold in 1998, making it the biggest
growth area in China's consumer electronics market, according to
China Machinery and Electronics News.
</P>
<P>
Some 1,000 Little Swan brand dishwashers were sold out in the
five major cities of Beijing, Shanghai, Guangzhou, Shenzhen and
Wuhan less than a a month after they came on the market at the end
of last year. In the new year, Little Swan introduced a new fully
automatic model in over 20 large cities.
</P>
<P>
According to a survey conducted by the Guangzhou Hengtong
Market Consultant Company, of 2,200 families in ten major cities,
2.3 percent have an immediate wish to buy a dishwasher, and 6.4
percent want to buy one in the near future.
</P>
<P>
Since these cities have 14 million families, the immediate
demand stands at 320,000 dishwashers, and the near-future demand
will be 900,000, the survey said. And the immediate demand will
rise to two million units, and the near-future target to six
million units, if the 100 million urban households are taken into
account.
</P>
<P>
"The dishwasher will emancipate the hands for the second time,
following the first liberation brought about by washing machines,"
an expert was quoted by the newspaper as saying.

<HEADLINE> Uganda's Ruling Party to Stay in Power for Long </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KAMPALA, February 8 (Xinhua) -- The ruling National Resistance
Movement (NRM) of Uganda will remain in power for a very long time
because it enjoys the support of the majority of the people, a
high-placed official in the party has said.
</P>
<P>
Moses Kigongo, vice chairman of NRM, made the remarks at a MP's
 victory celebration held Sunday at Lugazi town, 60 km east of
Kampala, the New Vision paper reported Monday.
</P>
<P>
He said some disgruntled elements should stop saying that the
Movement has remained in power for long. The truth is that this
government will indeed remain in power for a long time because the
people want it.
</P>
<P>
The vice chairman also defended the coming referendum on the
country's future political system, saying it will take place
despite threats of a boycott from various quarters.
</P>
<P>
To boycott the referendum is unconstitutional and the
government will not allow such activity, he added.
</P>
<P>
The government will defend and protect every provision of the
Constitution at any cost, he said.

SHANGHAI, February 8 (Xinhua) -- A record 10,000 people from
Shanghai are going abroad for Spring Festival, China's major
holiday, which starts on February 16 this year.
</P>
<P>
This is twice the number for last year, said an official of the
city's tourism administration.
</P>
<P>
Five travel agencies that have licenses for the overseas
tourism business have been crowded with people asking for
information or forms since January. Most of them want to go to
Southeast Asia, especially Thailand and Malaysia. The Republic of
Korea is also a major destination.
</P>
<P>
Local analysts attribute the growth to the improved standard of
living and changing ideas about spending the festival at home.
Lower costs because of fierce competition among travel agencies
have also helped.

<P>
NANCHANG, February 8 (Xinhua) -- Vice-Premier Wen Jiabao
stressed the importance of constructing more water-control works
during his inspection tour of the flood-afflicted areas in Jiangxi
Province in east China from February 5 to 7.
</P>
<P>
Wen pointed out that reconstruction after the floods is a
systematic project requiring overall planning and a high sense of
responsibility, and that this work is directly related to social
stability.
</P>
<P>
Wen asked the local governments in the flood-afflicted areas to
adopt effective measures to improve agricultural conditions and
the ecological environment.
</P>
<P>
This is to be done by the construction of water-control works,
the development of versatile agricultural structures including
township enterprises, and the acceleration of the application of
science and technology to agriculture.
</P>
<P>
Jiangxi Province suffered from severe flooding last year, and
has been undertaking reconstruction work ever since. So far, most
of the flood victims in the area have had their various
difficulties solved and have been moved into new homes.
</P>
<P>
Wen inspected two counties and newly built immigration centers
in the region, and expressed lunar New Year wishes to the flood
victims, on behalf of the Communist Party of China Central
Committee and the State Council.
</P>
<P>
While inspecting the construction of dykes along the Yangtze
River, he stressed that only a combination of strict management
with a high sense of responsibility can guarantee the quality of
this important project.

<HEADLINE> FBI, Kenyan Police Release August Blast Suspect </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, February 8 (Xinhua) -- The U.S. Federal Bureau of
Investigations (FBI) and the Kenyan police have released a
mechanic they had detained in connection with the August 7
Nairobi bombing, the Daily Nation newspaper reported Monday.
</P>
<P>
The suspect Mohfoudh Salim was set free Saturday from Nyali
police station without charges after the FBI agents and the Kenya
police received a High Court order requiring his release last
Friday from extradition to the United States for further
questioning over the Nairobi bombing.
</P>
<P>
The court also barred Attorney-General Amos Wako from handing
over Salim to the FBI agents. The Kenyan police were demanded to
arraign Salim in court or set him free.
</P>
<P>
Salim has been informed by police that he is expected to get
his passport on Tuesday. The FBI had suspected that Salim's
garage could have been used by the main suspect of the blast.
They visited his garage several times, seizing his passport and
interrogating him for over 12 hours.
</P>
<P>
According to a six-page affidavit filed by Salim's brother, the
U.S. agents tortured Salim. Salim's lawyer emphasized that the
FBI should not be allowed to operate with impunity "as if they are
in a Banana Republic".
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Shariff Nassir, Minister of Home Affairs and Social
Service, demanded the immediate halt of FBI agents' operations in
Coast Province. He said the agents were harassing and
intimidating members of the Islamic community "with impunity".

<TEXT>
<P>
KAMPALA, February 8 (Xinhua) -- Uganda is taking effective
measures to ensure the quality of some imported goods following
reports of importation of damaged and expired food stuffs and
chemicals.
</P>
<P>
A press release issued Monday by the Uganda National Bureau of
Standards (UNBS) and National Environment Management Authority
(NEMA) said that all rice, juice, wheat flour and other food
consignments imported into the country shall be verified by
authorities concerned.
</P>
<P>
Any consignment that is being queried will be re-inspected by a
joint team of competent officers from UNBS and NEMA.
</P>
<P>
The importers should be responsible for removal of those bad
imported goods from Uganda and for the safe disposal outside the
territory of Uganda, it said.
</P>
<P>
The importation of these goods is deliberately using Uganda as
a dumping ground. They are imported either for human consumption
or for dumping, it said.
</P>
<P>
Some importers are salvaging, sorting and repackaging the
damaged rice, wheat or other food stuffs. This is dangerous to
human health because some of these consignments already contain
substances that are toxic to humans and animals and also
constitute great hazards to the environment, noted the release.

<HEADLINE> Former Khmer Rouge Forces Integrated Into RCAF </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BATTAMBANG, Cambodia, February 8 (Xinhua) -- An integration
ceremony was held Monday in Tasanh of Samlot in Battambang
province to reintegrate the former Khmer Rouge forces into the
Royal Cambodia Armed Forces (RCAF).
</P>
<P>
Deputy Prime Minister and co-Minister of Interior Sar Kheng
presided over the ceremony. Also at present were Deputy
Commanders-in-Chief Lt. Gen. Pol Aaroeun and Lt. Gen. Meas Sophea.
</P>
<P>
Sar Kheng expressed his warm welcome to the reintegrated former
Khmer Rouge forces. "The past fighting fields would be surely
changed into an economic developing area in order to improve
people's living conditions," he said.
</P>
<P>
The ceremony, organized by the Fifth Military Region, was also
attended by some foreign military attaches and Cambodian and
foreign journalists.
</P>
<P>
Monday's integration included nearly 1,800 breakaway Khmer
Rouge soldiers from Samlot district led by Iem Phan, the former
RCAF Division 16 commander, and Meas Muth, who defected to the
government in 1996 but slipped back into resistance following
factional fighting in July 1997 between FUNCINPEC and the
Cambodian People's Party (CPP).
</P>
<P>
At the same time, about 2,000 soldiers were demobilized
according to the government's military restructuring policy to
curtail military spending.
</P>
<P>
Tasanh, about 90 km southwest of Battambang, was the front-line
for 17 months of low-intensity warfare between government troops
and once-integrated hard-liners who split from the government in
1997.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, another integration ceremony will be held on Tuesday
in Anlong Veng district, Siem Reap, and will be presided by
co-Minister of Defense Tea Banh and Prince Sisowath Sirirath.
About 1,700 former Khmer Rouge soldiers will be integrated and
another 2,600 will be demobilized.
</P>
<P>
The Khmer Rouge forces in Anlong Veng to be integrated into the
RCAF are the last Khmer Rouge remnants that have separated from
their hard-line leaders.
</P>
<P>
The Anlong Veng and Samlot rebels defected on December 4, 1998
in what was described as the end of the Khmer Rouge's more than 20
years of armed struggle. Anlong Veng, about 120 km north of Siem
Reap town, fell to the government last April, dispossessing the
rebels of their main stronghold.
</P>
<P>
So far, only Ta Mok, Khmer Rouge's top leader, is still at
jungle. Khmer Rouge leaders Khieu Samphan and Nuon Chea had
already defected to the government on December 25, 1998.

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, February 8 (Xinhua) -- Li Ruihuan, chairman of the
Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference National
Committee, expressed his satisfaction here today with the smooth
development of Sino-Uruguayan relations in a meeting with Jaime
Mario Trobo, president of the Chamber of Deputies of Uruguay.
</P>
<P>
Li said that the last decade has witnessed the advancement of
friendly ties between the two countries which share common views
on many international issues.
</P>
<P>
To consolidate bilateral cooperation in various fields is not
only in the interests of the two peoples, but also is in keeping
with the trend of development in the world, Li added.
</P>
<P>
He said he appreciated the Uruguayan government's adherence to
the One China policy, its opposition to the independence of Taiwan,
and its support of the Chinese government on the issue of human
rights.
</P>
<P>
Li described Uruguay as an important country in regional and
international affairs.
</P>
<P>
Trobo said that since the two countries established diplomatic
relations 10 years ago, great progress has been made in bilateral
cooperation in various fields.
</P>
<P>
He said that the two countries, on the basis of sound political
ties, should advance trade and economic cooperation in order to
expand the fields for bilateral cooperation.
</P>
<P>
As an important member of the South American Common Market,
Uruguay would like to push forward Uruguay-China relations on the
basis of mutual respect, added Trobo, who arrived here Sunday as
the guest of China's National People's Congress Standing Committee.
</P>
<P>
Trobo also said that the Uruguayan parliament is committed to
consolidating Uruguay's friendship with other countries, and his
current China visit is aimed at enhancing mutual understanding,
cementing exchanges between the congresses of Uruguay and China,
and promoting Uruguay-China ties.

<HEADLINE> SADC Meet to Address Millennium Bug Crisis </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUSAKA, February 8 (Xinhua) -- The Southern African Development
 Community (SADC) has said it is working toward keeping the region
abreast with development in information technology (IT) in the
face of the impending millennium bug.
</P>
<P>
SADC Executive Secretary Kaire Mbuende said in Lusaka Sunday
that the SADC would hold a consultative conference this coming
Friday to help raise the required awareness and make specific
recommendations on what strategies the region should take to face
the problem.
</P>
<P>
Monday's Zambia Daily Mail quoted Mbuende as saying that the
objective of the conference, under the theme "SADC in the next
Millennium: Opportunities and Challenges of Information
Technology," was to exchange ideas on the important role IT plays
in the economy.
</P>
<P>
He observed that the region needed to understand better the
role information technology plays in shaping economic and business
strategies at global, regional, national and micro-enterprise
level.
</P>
<P>
The conference will draw participants from cooperating
partners, the SADC representatives and the international business
community, labor, quasi- government organizations,
non-governmental organizations and other civil society groups that
have interest in information technology.
</P>
<P>
Mbuende said the SADC was aiming at developing an information
society in southern Africa to improve and broaden access to
information.
</P>
<P>
He noted that the implementation of a regional strategy on IT
would depend on active collaboration by the member states and
called on effective mechanisms to ensure the program succeeded.

<HEADLINE> Ozone, Overfishing Threaten UV-sensitive Krill: Expert </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, February 8 (Xinhua) -- New research by an Australian
expert has found krill, the little shrimps at the heart of the
Antarctic food chain, are in double danger from climate change and
the likelihood of greatly increased fishing.
</P>
<P>
The research also shows krill are highly sensitive to
ultraviolet (UV) light from the hole in the ozone layer while
conservationists fear an American corporation is gearing up to
massively increase krill fishing in the Antarctic.
</P>
<P>
A serious decline in krill, and some decline already appears to
be happening, could have a disastrous impact on seals, penguins,
whales and sea birds, scientists and conservationists said Monday.
</P>
<P>
Steve Nicol, a marine biologist at the Australian Antarctic
Division headquarters in Hobart, capital of Australia's island
state of Tasmania, stumbled on krill's sensitivity to UV light
while studying its genetics.
</P>
<P>
He said laboratory tests showed it was more susceptible to UV
than any other animal.
</P>
<P>
"We found it was very lethal," he told the Australian
Associated Press.
</P>
<P>
Nicol said the finding was a warning sign at a time when krill
was already under pressure from warmer air temperatures and
reduced ice cover.
</P>
<P>
Nicol said one quick response would be to cut allowable krill
catches.
</P>
<P>
But Alistair Graham, coordinator of Isofish, the
Australian-government supported Antarctic conservation watchdog,
fears the opposite may happen.
</P>
<P>
He said the annual krill catch limit was now 1.2 million tons
in the south Atlantic and 300,000 tons in the southern Indian
Ocean.
</P>
<P>
In fact, only about a "negligible" 80,000 tons was being taken,
mainly by Japanese.
</P>
<P>
But the American agri-business giant Cargil was gearing up for
a much larger assault on stocks, which were used as an additive to
fish farm food and as a protein supplement for human food.
</P>
<P>
There were signs that the British, east Europeans and Canadians
were preparing to join the hunt while Chilean fishing companies,
in difficulties as the anchovy fisheries went further offshore in
response to El Nino, were likely to move south.
</P>
<P>
Nicol's findings follow American research, published last month
in the British journal Nature, which reported a decline in the
krill population around the Antarctic Peninsula.

<HEADLINE> Sydney 2000 Rapped for Poor Environment Record </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, February 8 (Xinhua) -- Sydney's 2000 Olympic Games
have got a rap over the knuckles for their failing to live up to
their promise to be a showcase for environmentalism.
</P>
<P>
According to a report released Monday, the Olympics
Coordination Authority, the Games venue builder, had already
amassed a "poor" environmental record, ditching its key
environmental commitments in its venues building.
</P>
<P>
The idea of a "Green Games" was one of Sydney's biggest selling
points and its bid committee enlisted the help of environmental
group Greenpeace in securing the Games.
</P>
<P>
And in a report to be released later this week, the
environmental group found the Sydney Organising Committee for the
Olympic Games was "deficient" environmentally in its 800 million
Australian (520 million US) dollar merchandising program.
</P>
<P>
SOCOG's environmental problems resulted from its issuing
licenses to manufacturers for some products that were "actively
environmentally damaging" such as PVC plastic mugs and children's
shoes, the watchdog said.
</P>
<P>
Green Games Watch 2000 is partly funded by the Australian
government to act as an independent auditor of Sydney's
environmental record in staging the Olympics.

BEIJING, February 8 (Xinhua) -- Though incurring losses in Hong
Kong and Singapore, Hong Kong's leading tie and shirt maker
Goldlion continued to make profits in inland areas in 1998, the
Economic Daily reported.
</P>
<P>
Goldlion (China) Clothing and Leathermade Ltd. reported sales
of 1.3 billion yuan (156.6 million US dollars) and net profits of
159 million yuan on the mainland in 1998, respectively up 2.8
percent and 3.5 percent year on year.
</P>
<P>
Despite Goldlion Group's losses in Hong Kong and Singapore due
to Asian financial crisis, its overall performance was good last
year, since the mainland business accounts for 80 percent of it
total, the Daily said.
</P>
<P>
Since it entered into the mainland market 12 years ago,
Goldlion has reported a total turnover of 5.83 billion yuan and
recorded profits of 880 million yuan. It has also paid taxes of
213 million yuan.
</P>
<P>
The company has opened over 800 boutiques and special shops in

<HEADLINE> Refugee Repatriation From Kenya Suspended </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, February 8 (Xinhua) -- The United Nations has
suspended the planned repatriation of 2,400 refugees to Ethiopia
from Kenya due to a prolonged drought in Ethiopia's Godey and
Jiga regions where they are to be resettled.
</P>
<P>
The refugees at three U.N. camps at Dadaab in Kenya's North
Eastern Province have been in this east African country since
1991, said the official newspapers Kenya Times Monday.
</P>
<P>
The resettlement was scheduled for later February but has to be
put off to next month or April, according to Collins Asare, head
of United Nations High Commission for Refugees (UNHCR) at Dadaab.
</P>
<P>
Asare said it is unlikely that the Ethiopian refugees will be
airlifted home this month because of the drought. The U.N. has
provided funds to charter aircraft for the exercise and to
provide basic needs for the Ethiopians to enable them to restart
their life.
</P>
<P>
Last December, the UNHCR successfully resettled 2,500
Ethiopians in the  Moyale regions of that country.
</P>
<P>
According to the UNHCR, most of the refugees fled to Kenya when
Somalia descended into civil war in 1991 and they comprise elders
and the descendants of the original refugees who have not set
eyes on their homeland.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the Kenyan authorities have asked the U.N. to
repatriate refugees from its soil, accusing them of fomenting
insecurity.

<HEADLINE> Automobile Market to Face Severe Challenges: Expert </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Although many of world's giant auto groups eye China for their
future expansion, such factors as the current trend towards
mergers, the lingering Asian financial crisis, and over-production
in the global auto industry, all pose threats to the development
of the auto industry in China.
</P>
<P>
Experts estimate that the auto industry will continue to grow
at a low rate this year despite government policies intended to
stimulate car purchases.
</P>
<P>
The heads of several major auto groups have attributed this
situation to increased restrictions imposed upon car purchases by
government institutions, and unjustified fees and costs apart from
taxes.
</P>
<P>
Statistics from China's auto industry consultation and
development corporation indicate that the market demand will be 1.
72 million autos of all types this year, including 477,000
passenger vehicles, and 672,000 cargo vehicles, up 3.9 percent and
1.5 percent respectively from last year.
</P>
<P>
Analysts say that technological and price competition will
become more severe this year and this will be reflected in the
increasing number of environmentally friendly cars.
</P>
<P>
They explained that as small-sized cars, previously favored by
domestic producers, do not meet current environmental protection
standards, the growth of their production will be checked, and
more environmentally friendly types of cars will become the focus
of competition among producers.

<HEADLINE> China Steps Up Exploration of Offshore Oilfields in Bohai Sea </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, February 8 (Xinhua) -- China is speeding up efforts to
explore a group of oilfields, both large and small, in the Bohai
Sea in north China, in a bid to develop the Bohai Oilfield into
one capable of producing more than 10 million tons of crude a year
in early next century.
</P>
<P>
According to Lin Shaodong, president of the China Offshore Oil
Bohai Corporation (COOBC), the corporation has so far verified
geological oil reserves of more than 800 million tons in the Bohai
Sea.
</P>
<P>
The COOBC is developing simultaneously the Qinhuangdao 32-6 and
Nanbao 35-2 oilfields, two large offshore oilfields each with
reserves exceeding 100 million tons, in the central part of the
Bohai Sea.
</P>
<P>
Crude oil turned out by the two oilfields will be piped inland
through the port of Jingtang in the city of Tangshan in Hebei
Province. The two oilfields are expected to have an annual crude
production capacity of four million tons.
</P>
<P>
Qinhuangdao 32-6 Oilfield, with 170 million tons of verified
geological oil reserves, is some 100 kilometers east of Tianjin.
Presently, eleven wells have been drilled there.
</P>
<P>
Nanbao 35-2 Oilfield, lies 20 kilometers south of Tangshan.
Four test wells have been drilled and geological oil reserves of
70 million tons have been identified. Nanbao is estimated to have
total oil reserves of 110 million tons.
</P>
<P>
The COOBC president said that the distance between the two
oilfields is just 20 kilometers, making it possible for them to
develop into a 70-square-kilometer oil-bearing area in the central
Bohai Sea.
</P>
<P>
The two oilfields will begin production in 2003, and are
expected to develop an annual production capacity of four million
tons by 2004, which will boost the development of a series of
small and medium-sized oilfields in the area.
</P>
<P>
In addition, the COOBC is sinking caissons to build offshore
oil platforms at the Jinzhou 9-3 Oilfield in Bohai Bay, said Lin.
</P>
<P>
He noted that this oilfield, with proven oil reserves of more
than 30 million tons, has developed 27 oil wells, 26 water
injecting wells, and one natural gas well. It is expected to go
into operation by the end of this year.
</P>
<P>
This year, Lin said, the COOBC will give priority to developing
three oil exploration centers in the Bohai Sea area.
</P>
<P>
They are the Liaobei oil exploration center, consisting of the
Jinzhou 20-2 and Jinzhou 9-3 oilfields; the Liaozhong center,
based on Suizhong 36-1 oilfield; and the Shijiu center based on
Qinhuangdao 32-6 oilfield.

<HEADLINE> More Taiwan Residents Visit Mainland Areas </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, February 8 (Xinhua) -- Taiwan residents have made over
13 million visits to mainland areas in the past 11 years, an
official with the Taiwan Affairs Office (TWA) of the State Council
has revealed.
</P>
<P>
During the same period, over 240,000 mainland residents visited
Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
In 1998 an estimated 1.8 million visits were made across the
Taiwan Straits and the TWA says that this steady increase
indicates that there are now convenient conditions for exchange
visits provided by the central government.
</P>
<P>
There are now also air routes open between the mainland and
Taiwan via Macao and the increase in tourists from Taiwan is as a
direct result.
</P>
<P>
The TWA believes these exchanges enhance understanding between
people across the Straits.
</P>
<P>
Now the TWA is encouraging more Taiwan residents to visit
relatives, travel, set up businesses and arrange more academic and
cultural exchanges on the mainland.
</P>
<P>
They also expect Taiwan authorities to further relax
restrictions on mainland residents visiting Taiwan.

<HEADLINE> Howard Praises Hussein as "Courageous Peacemaker" </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, February 8 (Xinhua) -- Jordan's late King Hussein was
a "courageous fighter" for peace in the Middle East, who was
entitled to join the ranks of the region's other great
peacemakers, Prime Minister John Howard said Monday.
</P>
<P>
Howard singled out King Hussein's intervention in October to
inspire the signing of the Wye River land-for-security accord
between Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and Palestinian
leader Yasser Arafat.
</P>
<P>
"Probably the finest tribute that can be paid to him is to
recall his very courageous involvement when the Wye River accord
was being negotiated," he told reporters.
</P>
<P>
"Clearly suffering the devastation of cancer, he came from his
sick bed and worked very hard to bring about the agreement between
the Israelis and the Palestinians," he said. "And as a result he
is entitled to join the others who have tried so very hard to
bring about a peace settlement in the Middle East."
</P>
<P>
Howard said he had sent a message to the prime minister of
Jordan expressing Australia's sadness at the death of the king,
and the desire for close relations to continue under Hussein's
successor, King Abdullah.
</P>
<P>
Howard said it was physically impossible for Australia to send
a senior representative to the funeral, which will be held Monday
because Islamic tradition demands the funeral be held within 24
hours.
</P>
<P>
The tyranny of distance and religious requirements for a speedy
burial had denied Australia the chance to send a senior
representative to Monday evening's funeral, he said.

<HEADLINE> US Machinery Safety Test Underwriter Launches Branch in Jiangsu </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NANJING, February 8 (Xinhua) -- America's leading machinery
safety test underwriter, Underwriters Laboratories Inc. (UL), has
set up a subsidiary in east China's Jiangsu Province to simplify
the province's export safety test procedure.
</P>
<P>
This is UL's 10th branch in the Chinese mainland. Before this,
companies in Jiangsu, China's second largest machinery exporter,
had to apply to its other test centers for UL certificates.
</P>
<P>
China-made machinery products, especially, electrical equipment,
require a UL safety test certificate to enter the US market. So
far, more than 260 machinery export companies in Jiangsu have
received the documents. They reported a combined export of 6.2
billion U.S. dollars last year with 28 percent shipped to the
American and European regions.
</P>
<P>
Machinery exports account for 39.6 percent of Jiangsu's total
export volume. The establishment of the center is conducive to
improving the province's export ability by condensing the
formalities and reducing the cost.
</P>
<P>
China's export companies are attaching more importance to the
after-sales safety inspection of exported products and fighting
hard against fake UL certificates to protect their product images
offshore.

<TEXT>
<P>
KUALA LUMPUR, February 8 (Xinhua) -- Malaysia's Commerce Asset-
Holding Bhd (CAHB) and the shareholders of Bank Bumiputra Malaysia
Bhd (BBMB) signed a merger agreement here Monday.
</P>
<P>
CAHB and BBMB's shareholders -- Minister of Finance
Incorporated (MOF) and Khazanah Nasional Bhd -- signed the share
exchange agreement, BBMB and CAHB said in a joint statement.
</P>
<P>
However, BBMB's subsidiaries -- Bumiputra Merchant Bankers Bhd
and BBMB Securities Sdn Bhd -- will be retained by the existing
shareholders of BBMB.
</P>
<P>
Bumiputra Commerce Bank Bhd will be the new name for the merged
entity which will emerge as Malaysia's second largest financial
services group holding assets of 65 billion ringgit (17.105
billion U.S. dollars).
</P>
<P>
The merger will involve the government selling its shares in
BBMB to CAHB in exchange for new CAHB shares.
</P>
<P>
The government through MOF and Khazanah will emerge with a
shareholding of 30 percent in CAHB after the merger. Currently,
the government owns 98 percent equity in BBMB through the two
entities.
</P>
<P>
As part of the share exchange agreement, a put option will be
granted to CAHB and the merged bank for ex-BBMB loans for 18
months following the merger.
</P>
<P>
Under the option, corporate loans that are identified as
non-performing loans during the period will be transferred at face
value to a special purpose vehicle established by Pengurusan
Danaharta Nasional Bhd (National Asset Management Corporation).
</P>
<P>
A similar structure would be established for small businesses
and consumer non-performing loans, under which the merged bank
will buy back the loans at a discount to their written down value.

<HEADLINE> Better Educated Have Less Sleep, Study Shows </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, February 8 (Xinhua) -- The more education Chinese
urbanites receive, the less sleep they have or need, according to
the results of recent research.
</P>
<P>
Those who have had only primary school education have an
average sleep pattern of eight hours and 54 minutes every day, 36
minutes longer than those who hold masters' degrees and doctorates.
</P>
<P>
The difference is more notable among females, according to the
survey, which was conducted by the People's University of China
among nearly 5,000 residents in 40 cities aimed at studying how
Chinese urbanites spend their lives.
</P>
<P>
The study also compared people's income and their sleep time,
finding that those who have a monthly salary of 1,500 yuan to 1,
750 yuan (180 to 210 U.S. dollars) sleep least, some eight hours
and 16 minutes, and those having income of over 3,000 yuan sleep
for nine hours and nine minutes.
</P>
<P>
Income level determines people's living standards, and
therefore affects the conditions for sleep, said Wang Qiyan, the
professor leading the study.
</P>
<P>
Although Chinese have varying sleep habits, most of them prefer
to sleep at night, with 2:50 a.m. the quietest time when 99.2
percent of Chinese urbanites are usually sound asleep.
</P>
<P>
Biologists say sleep has close connections with people's health
and life span, and people should form good sleeping habits.

<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, February 7 (Xinhua) -- U.N. mediated talks
between Indonesia and Portugal on an autonomy package for East
Timor will go on until any agreement could come out by April.
</P>
<P>
U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan, who met with Indonesian
Foreign Minister Ali Alatas and Portuguese Foreign Minister Jiame
Gama for an hour here Sunday, said any settlement on East Timor
should have local people's full participation.
</P>
<P>
The two ministers came to New York to follow up the week-long
talks between senior officials of the two countries which ended on
Friday.
</P>
<P>
The talks on the status of East Timor started in August last
year. Indonesia wanted autonomy as a definitive solution while
Portugal would only consider autonomy for a transitional period
until the people there exercise the right of determination.
</P>
<P>
In October, the United Nations presented a constitutional
framework for a wide ranging autonomy, Annan's personal
representative for East Timor Jamsheed Marker told reporters on
Friday.
</P>
<P>
Recently, Indonesia hinted that it would let the territory be
independent if the people there reject autonomy. However,
Indonesia does not agree to a referendum for fears of violence.
</P>
<P>
Describing his meeting with both ministers as "constructive",
Annan said any solution would have to involve representatives of
the East Timorese.
</P>
<P>
The U.N. chief was to meet with both men on Monday, but he had
to reschedule as he left for Jordan on Sunday for King Hussein's
funeral.
</P>
<P>
Alatas said both sides would accelerate talks on the autonomy
package in hopes of concluding by April. He reiterated Indonesia's
position for East Timor autonomy.

<HEADLINE> Legal Aid Comes to Help of Redundant </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HEFEI, February 8 (Xinhua) --Legal aid centers in China are
giving top priority to redundant workers, estimated to have now
reached 10 million, to help solve their financial problems or
disputes with former employers.
</P>
<P>
Last March, the Ministry of Justice issued a circular urging
China's 432 official legal aid offices to help them as it believes
those laid-off people are some of the country's most vulnerable.
</P>
<P>
Although they receive a certain amount of living allowances
from their former employers before finding new jobs, many have
problems concerning re-employment, marriage break downs and old-
age pension insurance. One common difficulty is that certain
employers refuse to provide any subsidies on the pretext of
inefficiency. Also occurring frequently are economic disputes when
laid-off workers try various ways to make money.
</P>
<P>
In recent years, as China has stepped up implementation of a
series of enterprise reforms, such as reducing staff to increase
efficiency and countless mergers or bankruptcies, millions have
found themselves jobless.
</P>
<P>
"Ensuring laid off workers receive proper legal assistance is
not only a step forward in improving the nation's legal system but
is also of special importance in maintaining social stability,"
said Liu Nanzheng, vice-director of the Legal Aid Center under the
Ministry of Justice.
</P>
<P>
Last year, the Hefei Legal Aid Center alone provided free legal
assistance to over 700 people, 20 percent of whom were laid-offs.
In Liaoning Province, a major industrial center in northeast China
and home to 1.9 million redundant workers, they accounted for some
40 percent of those who got free legal aid.
</P>
<P>
The legal aid on offer covers criminal and civil cases, drawing
up legal documents and providing consultations on a range of
issues.
</P>
<P>
And for Wang Wanyu, a 35 year old redundant woman filing a suit
for a false report against a major local newspaper in Hefei,
capital of east China's Anhui Province, the Hefei Legal Aid Center
has been both her protector and guide.
</P>
<P>
They provided a lawyer to help her, free of charge, and Wang
won her case against Anhui Radio and TV Guide, which had carried a
false advertisement for an unregistered company that cheated her
and another 100-odd people of 880 yuan each. That figure is equal
to the living allowances Wang received from her work unit in the
six months of her layoff. They all got their money back.
</P>
<P>
Wang is only one of an increasing number of redundant workers
who have benefited from the government sponsored legal aid system
initiated in China in 1994 to help the poor and the weak.
</P>
<P>
"Laid-off workers are more vulnerable to violations of their
rights," said Cao Caifeng, Wang's attorney. "We feel relieved that
more and more of them are enjoying their legitimate rights through
our help."

<P>
NAIROBI, February 8 (Xinhua) -- Kenyan President Daniel arap
Moi Sunday sent out a passionate appeal to Ethiopia and Eritrea
to stop the on-going hostilities along their disputed border.
</P>
<P>
In letters he dispatched to President Isaias Afeworki of
Eritrea and Prime Minister Meles Zenawi of Ethiopia, Moi warned
that the war will cost both countries loss in human life and
property, the Kenya Times reported Monday.
</P>
<P>
If the battle continues unchecked, an all-out war could break
out, Moi said, adding that the escalating violence is not in the
interest of the two countries.
</P>
<P>
Earlier this year, during a state visit to Ethiopia, Moi held
discussions with Zenawi to look into ways of stopping the war.

<HEADLINE> Geologists Moving on to New Fields </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHIJIAZHUANG, February 8 (Xinhua) -- Many of China's geologists
have thrown away their compasses and have begun running
restaurants and hotels, claiming there are no new mines waiting to
be discovered.
</P>
<P>
"We have to find new ways in order to survive, since all the
mines have already been thoroughly exploited," said Zhang Jisheng,
director of the Bureau for Exploring Geological Resources in Hebei
Province.
</P>
<P>
An increasing number of local governments in provinces like
north China's Hebei, which is abundant in coal, gold, iron and
other mineral resources, are now faced with this problem after
decades of unabated exploration.
</P>
<P>
In Hebei alone, there are 8,000 geologists whose salaries were
related to how many mines they located; however, they now must
move on to other fields as the central government has been cutting
back funds for mine exploration.
</P>
<P>
Zhang said that many geologists are now engaged in constructing
tunnels, building highways, and even running restaurants and
hotels to enhance their incomes.
</P>
<P>
Nonetheless, some scientists argue that more mineral resources
might be discovered if new methods are used.
</P>
<P>
Liu Guangding, an scholar with the Chinese Academy of Sciences,
said there are good possibilities that China could yet find some
very big oil fields if the geologists center on certain basin
areas formed before the Cenozoic period.
</P>
<P>
"China is a country with extremely abundant natural resources
which could be fully discovered within several decades," said Liu,
who was the leader of China's first offshore oil exploration team.
</P>
<P>
The massive exploration for mineral resources began in the 1950
s as part of the industrialization campaign.

<TEXT>
<P>
ZHENGZHOU, February 8 (Xinhua) -- A team of archeologists have
discovered remains of old Kaifeng, an ancient Chinese capital,
which was flooded by the Yellow River some 300 years ago.
</P>
<P>
The team has found outlines of something they believe to be a
building buried five meters underground, as well as uncovering
bricks and tiles, and pieces of pottery dating back to the Ming
Dynasty (14th-16th century).
</P>
<P>
The archeologists have also discovered traces of another
building in use during the Song Dynasty (10th-13th century), when
Kaifeng was the capital of China.
</P>
<P>
They are important discoveries about the ancient capital
following the excavation of a city gate in 1996, the archeologists
said.
</P>
<P>
Kaifeng, in central China's Henan province, is listed as one of
the six ancient Chinese capitals. The city had been rebuilt
several times because of Yellow River flooding.

<HEADLINE> Bangkok Bank in Deep Mire of Bad Loans </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, February 8 (Xinhua) -- Bangkok Bank, the largest
commercial banks in Thailand, is in deep mire of non-performing
loans (NPLs), The Nation reported Monday.
</P>
<P>
The newspaper said that NPLs in Bangkok Bank now stand at 48
percent of total loans.
</P>
<P>
The shocking revelation sent its share price plummeting 16.35
percent to close at 43.50 baht (1.2 U.S. dollars) last week
against 52 baht (1.44 dollars) on January 27.
</P>
<P>
However, The Nation said the figure did not exceed banking
analysts' expectations when they measure NPLs against the amount
of credit extended.
</P>
<P>
Bangkok Bank's NPLs increased by 120 billion baht (3.3 billion
dollars) in the first half of 1998, compared with about 100
billion baht (2.78 billion dollars) in the second half.
</P>
<P>
As of the end of 1998, Bangkok Bank's net loans accounted for
850 billion baht (23.6 billion dollars), down from 1.1 trillion
baht (30.6 billion dollars) in the previous year.
</P>
<P>
The bank's gross loans, including its provisioning in December
last year, amounted to more than 900 billion baht (25 billion
dollars).
</P>
<P>
The newspaper quoted a bank expert as saying that, for Bangkok
Bank to survive until 2000, the Bank needs a 20-billion-baht
(555-million-dollar) injection of fresh capital.

<HEADLINE> 34th SEAMEC Conference Opens in Singapore </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SINGAPORE, February 8 (Xinhua ) -- The 34th Conference of the
Southeast Asian Ministers of Education Council (SEAMEC) opened
here Monday with focus on promoting cooperation through the use of
information technology and other projects spearheaded by Regional
Centers under Southeast Asian Ministers for Education Organization
(SEAMEO).
</P>
<P>
Singapore President Ong Teng Cheong opened the two-day
conference and Singapore Minister for Education Teo Chee Hean, who
is also the acting SEAMEC president, made a welcoming speech at
the opening.
</P>
<P>
President Ong told the 124 participants that education has a
clear impact on the economic development of a country.
</P>
<P>
"It can also give our young people not only their roots to
anchor them securely to their cultural heritage, but also wings to
fly as high as their abilities can take them," he said.
</P>
<P>
Teo Chee Hean said in his speech that there is growing urgency
for education system to be forward-looking and be geared for the
future given the regional countries strive to overcome current
economic problems.
</P>
<P>
Teo said, "The best test of the effectiveness of our education
systems lies in how well we prepare the younger generation for the
future they will live in."
</P>
<P>
"The challenge in our fast-changing world is to equip them for
life, not just for the next examination," Teo added.
</P>
<P>
The minister attached greater importance to the development of
"Software" than to spending money on hardware like school
infrastructure, saying "there is much we can do in the 'software'
which can make a significant difference in the quality of
education."
</P>
<P>
Teo named strategic directions, curriculum and learning, and
organizational arrangement as three areas to be improved in
developing "software."
</P>
<P>
In face of rapid technological changes, he said, education has
to cater to the needs of the society which it serves and to be
responsive to the changing environment.
</P>
<P>
On curriculum and learning, Teo said, "we will have to ensure
that the curriculum is future-oriented. It has to take into
account the rapid explosion of knowledge."
</P>
<P>
Teo also suggested efforts be made to improve management of
schools so that they have greater efficiency and effectiveness.
</P>
<P>
SEAMEO was formed in 1965 to promote cooperation among the
Southeast Asian nations through education, science and culture.
</P>
<P>
It now has 10 member countries, namely, Brunei, Cambodia,
Indonesia, Laos, Malaysia, Myanmar, the Philippines, Singapore,
Thailand and Vietnam, and six associate member countries, namely,
Australia, Canada, France, Germany, the Netherlands and New
Zealand.
</P>
<P>
Most of SEAMEO programs have been conducted through its 14
regional centers.

<HEADLINE> Myanmar Military Official On Questions Raised by Japan </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
YANGON, February 8 (Xinhua) -- The state-run New Light of
Myanmar newspaper Monday carried excerpts from an interview made
by the Japan Times newspaper with Brigadier General Kyaw Win, a
high ranking Myanmar military official who visited Japan last
month at the invitation of the Japanese government.
</P>
<P>
Kyaw Win, deputy chief of the Office of Strategic Studies of
Myanmar Defense Ministry and deputy director of the Defense
Services Intelligence, toured Japan for nine days from January 20
to 28.
</P>
<P>
Asked about his views on the policy of sanctions on Myanmar by
the United States and European industrialized countries, Kyaw Win
commented that the policy is not very practical and realistic,
saying that without a strong economy and basic infrastructure,
transformation from one political system to another, especially
from one-party socialist system into a multi-party political
system, will not be possible.
</P>
<P>
On Japanese policy towards Myanmar, he praised it as a
practical one, reasoning that sanctions, boycott and embargo do
not help the country's transition to a democracy.
</P>
<P>
He said Myanmar does not have any specific requests to Japan
which used to be one of the biggest donors in the past, believing
that Japan may be able to extend assistance for education and
other social sectors despite the fact that Japan cannot provide
fresh official development aid to the country for various reasons.
</P>
<P>
Regarding the international accusation that the Myanmar
government is involved in narcotics trafficking, he said Myanmar
can challenge the world to show it evidence of its involvement,
saying that "we are doing more than our share to solve the
narcotics problem because we are one of few governments in the
world that is doing much anti-narcotics activities without any
outside assistance."
</P>
<P>
On Chine-Myanmar ties, he said that the two countries have
developed a good relationship as China is among countries that
have assisted and supported Myanmar when it was facing time of
difficulties from 1988 onward.

<HEADLINE> NZ Scientists Plan to Put Human Genes in Cows </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WELLINGTON, February 8 (Xinhua) -- New Zealand scientists plan
to put human genes into dairy cattle to make cow milk more like
human breast milk.
</P>
<P>
Local media reported Monday that details of the plan of New
Zealand crown research institute AgResearch are outlined in an
application to the Environmental Risk Management Authority (ERMA).
The scientists plan to conduct their field test at the Ruakura
Research Center in Hamilton, a city on North Island.
</P>
<P>
A summary of the AgResearch application to ERMA said the
Ruakura Research Center has initiated a major program "to produce
and field-test, in containment, genetically modified dairy cattle
that will produce milk of altered and improved composition".
</P>
<P>
The summary said a containment facility for the cattle has
already been built and is enclosed with 2-meter perimeter fences.
</P>
<P>
According to the plan, three genetic modifications will occur,
each resulting in transgenes being expressed in the animals' milk.
Two of the modifications are designed to alter the protein
content and composition of the milk.
</P>
<P>
Those cattle carrying a "myeline basic protein" transgene will
secrete it in their milk. It can be purified and used in the
treatment of multiple sclerosis.
</P>
<P>
The scientists also believe that if cow milk is more like human
 breast milk, it will be more palatable to consumers.

<P>
DHAKA, February 8 (Xinhua) -- Bangladeshi President Shahabuddin
Ahmed and Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina have expressed their deep
shock at the sad demise of King Hussein bin Talal of Jordan, the
official news agency BSS reported Monday.
</P>
<P>
"I would like to extend my deepest condolences to you and the
bereaved members of the royal family," Ahmed said in a message on
Sunday sent to Prince Abdullah bin al-Hussein, the regent of the
Hashemite Kingdom of Jordan.
</P>
<P>
Terming King Hussein as a "great leader and champion of peace,"
he said the king's commitment and dedication to the Middle East
peace process earned him great admiration, profound love and deep
respect from the peace-loving people all over the world.
</P>
<P>
The death of King Hussein on Sunday was a great loss for the
peace-loving people throughout the world, Hasina said.
</P>
<P>
"It is with a sense of deep grief and profound sorrow that we
have learnt the sad demise of his Majesty King Hussein bin Talal.
On behalf of the government and the people of Bangladesh and on my
own behalf, I would like to extend to your royal highness,
bereaved members of the royal family and the brotherly people of
the Hashemite Kingdom of Jordan our deepest sympathy and sincerest
condolences," she said in a message sent to Prince Abdullah bin
al-Hussein.
</P>
<P>
"King Hussein's death is a great loss not only for the
Jordanians but also to the region in particular and the
peace-loving people throughout the world," and "his commitment and
contribution to the Middle-east peace process and his vision will
be ever remembered," she said.
</P>
<P>
The king will be respected in Bangladesh for his contribution
to the development of fraternal relations between Bangladesh and
Jordan, said the prime minister.
</P>
<P>
"May Almighty Allah grant eternal peace to his departed soul
and give your royal highness, members of the royal family and the
brotherly people of Jordan the strength to withstand this
irreparable loss with courage and fortitude," she added.
</P>
<P>
As a mark of respect to King Hussein, Bangladesh's national
flag would fly on Monday and Tuesday at half-mast in all
government, semi-government and autonomous offices, as well as
Bangladeshi missions abroad, and the Jatiya Sangsad, the country's
parliament, was adjourned on Sunday night for a six-day recess.

<HEADLINE> Thailand Auctions Seized Real Estate Items </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, February 8 (Xinhua) -- The Financial Sector
Restructuring Authority (FRA) of Thailand managed to sell 45
percent of the seized real estate assets from the closed 56
financial companies after its second auction of 136 items on
Sunday, a FRA official said on Monday.
</P>
<P>
Some 136 real estate items with a benchmark price of 1,576.88
million baht (43.8 million U.S. dollars) were put under hammer on
Sunday.
</P>
<P>
The official said that the Sunday auction, the second of its
kind, earned FRA 422.9 million baht (11.7 million dollars), or
40.1 percent more than the benchmark price of 301.7 million baht
(8.38 million dollars).
</P>
<P>
The assets up for auction on Sunday included houses, commercial
buildings, condominiums, office buildings and plots of land, some
of which could not be sold in the previous auction.
</P>
<P>
Of the properties up for auction, 64 are located in Bangkok and
adjacent provinces with the remainder in other provinces.
</P>
<P>
The outcome of FRA's first auction of assets seized from
defunct finance companies in November was described by some as
disappointing.
</P>
<P>
The FRA, therefore, reduced the benchmark price by 10 percent
before the second auction.
</P>
<P>
A total of 173 applicants participated in Sunday's auction,
most of whom are Thais.

<HEADLINE> Detroit Upset Indiana 107-98 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, February 7 (Xinhua) -- The upstart Detroit Pistons
beat the early favorites for the Eastern Conference lead at their
own game, using a strong effort from the bench and on the boards
to post a 107-98 victory over the Indiana Pacers in Michigan
Sunday.
</P>
<P>
Grant Hill scored 26 points to lead Detroit, which opened the
season with an equally impressive 95-81 victory in Miami.
Overshadowing Hill was the strong play, especially down the
stretch, by the Piston's reserves.
</P>
<P>
"Indiana is a great team, and when the dust settles, they'll be
there," said Pistons coach Alvin Gentry. "It was fun for us
because it was a test against another quality team, but I still
don't think it says anything. Now that we've beaten Miami and
Indiana doesn't mean we'll win the NBA championship."
</P>
<P>
Jerry Stckhouse, who led Detroit with 24 points in the opener,
had 20 off the bench in this contest, including five in the final
three minutes.
</P>
<P>
Reserve forward Jerome Williams scored 11 of his 13 points in
the fourth quarter, including five in the decisive 7-0 spurt that
broke an 86-86 tie.
</P>
<P>
Williams also grabbed 11 rebounds and backup center Eric
Montross pulled down 14 as the Pistons outrebounded the Pacers 42-
38.
</P>
<P>
Reggie Miller fouled out with 26 points for Indiana, which was
picked by many to win the title after narrowly losing to Chicago
in last season's Eastern Conference finals.
</P>
<P>
The game was tight throughout with the first half ended 54-54.
Indiana's Antonio Davis hit a layup to make it 86-all with seven
minutes remaining. The score was 99-91 with 2:45 left.
</P>
<P>
Mark Jackson scored 12 points for Indiana, which hit 36-of-41
free throws but scored just seven points off 14 turnovers by the
Pistons.

<HEADLINE> Romania Prioritizes Deficit, Inflation Cuts in 1999 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BUCHAREST, February 7 (Xinhua) -- The Romanian government's top
priority in 1999 is to bring down budget deficit and inflation,
said Prime Minister Radu Vasile at a joint session of the senate
and the chamber of deputies on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
Presenting his cabinet's budget proposal for the year, Vasile
pledged the continued implementation of a series of new budgetary,
financial, tax and economic policies to help boost the chance of
success toward the goals.
</P>
<P>
As called for by the 1998-2000 program of action tabled up last
spring, when the cabinet came into office, the budget deficit
should be down from the 3.6 percent of gross domestic product last
year to 1.8 percent this year.
</P>
<P>
By cutting down the deficit, the prime minister was quoted by a
Rompress report as saying, the public debt pressure could be eased,
abilities to pay back external debts consolidated, and inflation
brought under control.
</P>
<P>
Analyzing factors affecting inflation in recent two years,
Vasile predicted a continuous inflation drop in coming two years --
from 40.6 down to 25 percent this year and an additional down of
five percentage points in 2000.
</P>
<P>
Official statistics indicate that Romania's inflation rate in
1997 hit a record high of 151 percent.

<HEADLINE> China Decides to Screen Disney's "Mulan" </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, February 8 (Xinhua) -- Cultural officials in China
have given the green light to Walt Disney's cartoon feature film "
Mulan", which is based on a traditional Chinese folk tale.
</P>
<P>
The blockbuster movie will be shown in northern Tianjin city
during the Spring Festival this month, and in Beijing in April,
informed sources said.
</P>
<P>
The movie was adapted from the well known story about Hua Mulan,
an ancient heroine who served in the army in place of her old and
sickly father. Nobody guessed she was a female until the war ended
because she disguised herself as a man. She was later hailed as a
great warrior.
</P>
<P>
The film was translated into six languages last year, including
Chinese, and has become one of the most profitable movies in
Disney's history.
</P>
<P>
However, the Chinese government did not immediately agree to
import the film last year. "The film was well shot, but importing
Mulan is a complicated issue," an official with the China Film
Export and Import Corporation said then.
</P>
<P>
In China, decisions on importing foreign movies usually relate
to political and cultural considerations.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the Beijing Opera House is currently on a two week
tour of the United States and a major part of the program, apart
from a series of excerpts of several Peking Opera stories, will be
performances of the 1,500 year old tale of Hua Mulan.
</P>
<P>
The is the first time that the troupe has undertaken a foreign
tour and they take in Washington, Los Angeles, New York and San
Francisco.
</P>
<P>
They will also tour major European cities in March as part of
an ongoing plan to promote Peking Opera which is enjoying a
revival in China.

<HEADLINE> Stardust Blasts Off to Fetch Comet Samples </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, February 7 (Xinhua) -- The U.S. National
Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) sent off the comet
probe Stardust from Cape Canaveral, Florida, on Sunday afternoon.
</P>
<P>
The spacecraft over the next seven years will be on the first
comet rendezvous mission since the fly-by of Comet Halley in 1986
and of Comet 26P/Grigg-Skjellerup in 1992 by Giotto, a European
probe.
</P>
<P>
Back and forth across a total 4.8 billion kilometers, it will
be also the first ever attempt to return comet samples to Earth.
</P>
<P>
Stardust will observe the Comet Wild-2 within about 160
kilometers and capture particles from the dust cloud surrounding
the nucleus of the comet in January 2004 and bring them back in
2006 for scientists to study.
</P>
<P>
Instruments aboard the spacecraft will also take close pictures
of the object and collect other data from the comet, believed by
scientists as the oldest and most primitive kind of bodies in the
solar system.
</P>
<P>
Comets are presumably made up of the same stuff as the early
Solar Nebula that collapsed to form the sun and planets.
</P>
<P>
Therefore, scientists say, materials in comets is largely
unchanged since the solar system formed 4.5 billion years ago and
could provide hints about the initial molecular ingredients that
led to life on Earth.

<HEADLINE> Thailand Welcomes Malaysia's Decision to Relax </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, February 8 (Xinhua) -- Thailand Sunday Welcomed
Malaysia's decision to relax currency controls, saying it would
help boost border trade which has been badly affected since the
imposition of the strict controls, the Bangkok Post reported
Monday.
</P>
<P>
Foreign Ministry deputy spokesman Kitti Wasinondh was quoted as
saying that Thailand hopes the move will benefit other areas such
as tourism.
</P>
<P>
"Thailand hopes that Malaysia's relaxation of controls on
ringgit will help stimulate positive developments in various
issues including tourism which will benefit the two countries," he
said.
</P>
<P>
Malaysia's central bank said Friday that it had relaxed the
import and export of its currency with immediate effect for
cross-border trade with Thailand.
</P>
<P>
Kitti said Malaysia's decision represents a positive response
to Thailand's request.
</P>
<P>
Prime Minister Chuan Leekpai had asked his Malaysian
counterpart Mahathir Mohamad during the Asia-Pacific Economic
Cooperation meeting in Kuala Lumpur last November to ease currency
controls which have hit tourism and trade in southern Thailand.

<HEADLINE> Italian Prime Minister Opposes Bombardment on Kosovo </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ROME, February 7 (Xinhua) -- Italian Prime Minister Massimo D'
Alema said that Italy would oppose bombardment on Kosovo such as
those used recently on Iraq, but would be ready to send soldiers
to Kosovo to enforce a peace deal.
</P>
<P>
In an interview published Sunday by newspaper Corriere della
Sera, D'Alema warned that bombing the separatists of ethnic
Albanians or the Serbs in Kosovo would be disastrous and that any
use of force had to be a last resort.
</P>
<P>
European and U.S. mediators began Saturday an intense two-week
negotiating session with Serb and Albanian representatives in
Rambouillet, outskirts of Paris. Meanwhile, NATO threatened that
air strikes would be inevitable if the talks failed.
</P>
<P>
"If it should be decided to send troops to Kosovo, we would
send our soldiers," D'Alema told the newspaper.
</P>
<P>
He said Italy would send soldiers even if it meant having to
sustain a military force in both Kosovo and Albania, where Italian
troops led a pacification mission in 1997 after popular revolts
led to virtual civil war.
</P>
<P>
D'Alema said that force should be considered only as an "
extreme option" and that an Iraq-style bombing of Kosovo was quite
out of the question, he said.
</P>
<P>
Recalling the disaccord shown by Europe during the latest U.S.-
British bombing of Iraq, D'Alema said he hoped that in this "
internal crisis" of Yugoslavia, European powers would stick to a
common line of peaceful diplomacy.
</P>
<P>
"In the days of the bombardment of Iraq, Europe was unable to
apply its weight, but we can correct this with Kosovo," he added.

</P>
<P>
A nationwide inspection on medicine quality in the last quarter

<HEADLINE> Banks: Don't Blame Me </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, February 7 (Xinhua) -- British Sports Minister Tony
Banks has rejected claims by Glenn Hoddle that he played a part in
his downfall as England manager.
</P>
<P>
Hoddle accused the minister of "jumping on the bandwagon" by
commenting publicly on the controversy over his remarks about
disabled people, which appeared in an article in The Times.
</P>
<P>
But the minister said, "I am disappointed that Glenn felt I had
played a part in his removal.
</P>
<P>
"I certainly didn't jump in and as far as a bandwagon was
concerned, when you are a public figure like the Sports Minister
you can't have no opinion when a sports-related situation emerges.
"
</P>
<P>
Hoddle gave his first major interview since being sacked on TV
on Saturday and said: "What disappointed me was the sports
minister -- don't you think he should have phoned me first? He
jumped on the bandwagon a little bit too quick.
</P>
<P>
"That built up, that snowballed and in the end, the press could
react on the back of that," he said.
</P>
<P>
Banks admitted he had described Hoddle's position as "becoming
increasingly untenable" after being asked to comment on the
England coach's chances of survival.
</P>
<P>
But he said: "That is an assessment of his position. I never at
any stage called for him to resign or for him to be sacked."
</P>
<P>
Acting Football Association chairman Geoff Thompson said Hoddle'
s comments, and his decision to publish his World Cup diary, were
serious errors of judgment.
</P>
<P>
He confirmed that future England manager would be warned to
stick to coaching the national team.
</P>
<P>
He told The Observer newspaper: "You can't have free speech
without responsibility and anybody in such a high-profile position
has to know the difference between saying what you want and saying
what you ought to."
</P>
<P>
Thompson said Hoddle lost credibility in the eyes of his team.
</P>
<P>
"I don't really see how managers can keep the respect of their
players and tell all to publishers at the same time.
</P>
<P>
"I realise you can make more money that way, but to be blunt, I
don't think Glenn needed to do it," he added.

<HEADLINE> Iran to Form National Committee for Paralympics </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, February 7 (Xinhua) -- Iranian Vice President and
Chairman of the Physical Education Organization Mostafa Hashemi-
Taba said on Sunday that Iran has planned to form a national
committee for paralympics to promote the sportsmanship of the
disabled.
</P>
<P>
Hashemi-Taba made the remark in a meeting with Chairman of the
International Committee of Paralympics Robert Daniel Steward, the
Islamic Republic News Agency reported.
</P>
<P>
He said a group of Iranian experts on the disabled's
sportsmanship are scheduled to visit the paralympics centers in
Canada soon.
</P>
<P>
Steward said the Iranian disabled sportsmen have made eye-
catching progress in recent years compared with other countries
which have 40 years of experiences in paralympics.
</P>
<P>
He said the paralympics games would be held in Sydney in the
year 2000.
</P>
<P>
He predicted that 5,000 athletes from 125 countries and regions
would take part in the paralympics games.

JAKARTA, February 8 (Xinhua) -- The Indonesian Foreign Ministry
expressed profound sadness over the death of Jordanian leader King
Hussein on Sunday, and hoped that the Middle Eastern country's

spokesman for the Foreign Ministry Gaffar Fadhyl was quoted by
Antara News Agency Monday as saying.

<HEADLINE> Hodgson Keen on England Job </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, February 7 (Xinhua) -- Former Blackburn manager Roy
Hodgson has confirmed he would be willing to succeed Glenn Hoddle
as England boss if offered the chance by the Football Association
(FA).
</P>
<P>
He said that he was flattered to be named as a candidate for
the job.
</P>
<P>
"If I was offered it, of course I would accept it," the 51-year-
old added.
</P>
<P>
He has international experience as Swiss national manager and
is widely respected throughout Europe.
</P>
<P>
His comments came after Middlesbrough boss Bryan Robson and
Aston Villa's John Gregory became the latest names to declare that
they would be staying with their clubs.
</P>
<P>
Fellow front-runner Kevin Keegan has indicated he has no
intention of leaving Fulham, while Manchester United said they
would resist any approach for manager Alex Ferguson.
</P>
<P>
But Hodgson said: "I've been disappointed to see so many high-
profile people coming out and saying I don't want the job.
</P>
<P>
"First of all, this might sound old-fashioned, but I don't
think you have a right to comment on jobs, to say whether you want
them or you don't want them, until you're offered them."
</P>
<P>
He said managing the national team was "the highest job in
football in England".
</P>
<P>
Hodgson added: "The person in charge of that national team has
got to be the top man, the one that everyone in the country or
certainly those who are making the decision, think is the top man,
the right man for the job.
</P>
<P>
"It's a bit strong if they've got to take somebody, just
because nobody else wants it."
</P>
<P>
Hodgson said Hoddle had done a good job as England manager and
described him as a "very genuine man, a very caring man".
</P>
<P>
He added: "A strong self-belief is important, but of course,
coaching in particular is a two-way process. It's got to be giving
and taking. It's got to be educating and listening.
</P>
<P>
"I do think the wisest coaches are those that have got the
ability to listen and take in some of the advice or vibrations
that they get around them.
</P>
<P>
"I don't necessarily mean they'll get that from the mass media -
- that's not so. But they'll get it from the players, they'll get
it from the staff and to some extent there are a lot of people in
the mass media who've been in football a long time, who've seen a
lot of matches, who've seen a lot of managers come and go, who've
seen a lot of players come and go.
</P>
<P>
"Sometimes their observations are very interesting as well
because they can refer back to a reference point that maybe you
yourself could not refer to."
</P>
<P>
Hodgson had a fairly undistinguished playing career but made
his name as a manager.
</P>
<P>
He was given his first chance by Bristol City before moving to
Sweden, where he led Halmstad to two league titles.
</P>
<P>
A chance to manage Malmo followed and Hodgson guided them to
five championships and two cup wins. He later moved on to
Switzerland where he took charge of Neuchatel Xamax before landing
the national team manager's post.
</P>
<P>
Hodgson guided Switzerland to USA '94 World Cup, the first time
they had qualified for the World Cup finals since 1966, and Euro '
96.
</P>
<P>
He was then given the chance to test his managerial skills in
Italy's Serie A and led them to the UEFA Cup final, before
returning to his native England to become Blackburn boss.
</P>
<P>
The Ewood Park club qualified for Europe by finishing sixth
last season but were quickly eliminated from the UEFA Cup this
term and poor league form led to Hodgson losing his job.

<HEADLINE> New Zealand Meat Exports Increase 5 Percent Last Year </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WELLINGTON, February 8 (Xinhua) -- New Zealand's exports of
meat and meat co-products accounted for about 18 percent of its
total merchandise exports of 21.6 billion NZ dollars (11.7 billion
U.S. dollars) in the year to September 1998, with meat exports
rising five percent to 2.9 billion NZ dollars (1.6 billion U.S.
dollars), despite reduced sales in Asia.
</P>
<P>
The past year was tough for New Zealand farmers and the red
meat industry generally, and the industry faced extended drought
and flooding, the Asian economic crisis and the possibility of
world recession, Meat NZ Chairman John Acland said in an annual
report of the organization, which was made public Monday.
</P>
<P>
According to figures in the report, beef sales to South Korea
were especially badly hit down from 14,340 tons in 1997 to 4,049
tons in the year to September 1998. Beef sales to Indonesia
virtually vanished in the same period, going from almost 9,000
tons to 710 tons.
</P>
<P>
In contrast, lamb, mutton and beef sales to Singapore increased
significantly.
</P>
<P>
The report said that developing long-term relationships with
key markets in the East Asian region has helped New Zealand meat
exports ride out the worst of the economic storms.
</P>
<P>
Beef volumes to the United States rose from 194,000 tons in
1997 to 225,000 tons in the year to September 1998 and sheepmeat
exports to the country were also growing. The United States is now
New Zealand's fourth-biggest market, Acland said.
</P>
<P>
New Zealand's lamb sales to Britain fell from about 82,000 tons
in 1997 to just under 75,000 tons in the year to September 1998.
</P>
<P>
According to the figures issued in the report, New Zealand's
main sheepmeat markets continued to be the European Union, the
United States and the Middle East.

WELLINGTON, February 8 (Xinhua) -- The New Zealand government
will fly flags at half mast Tuesday in honor of the late King
Hussein of Jordan.

This decision was announced by New Zealand Prime Minister Jenny
Shipley here Monday.
</P>

"King Hussein was a man of great courage and vision. He was a

many decades.
</P>

"King Hussein's commitment to peace was underlined most
recently when in the midst of cancer treatment he made a crucial
contribution to persuading Palestine's Chairman Arafat and Israeli
Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu to accept the provisions of the
Wye River agreement," Shipley said in a media release.

<HEADLINE> SPD Facing Stepping down in Hesse </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BONN, February 7 (Xinhua) -- German Chancellor Gerhard
Schroeder's Social Democrats (SPD) suffered defeat in their first
regional election test on Sunday in the state of Hesse.
</P>
<P>
The Social Democrats and their Greens coalition partner trailed
with 46.4 per cent in Hesse state compared to 47.8 per cent for
the opposition Christian Democrats (CDU) and the Free Democrats
(FDP), according to ARD public television projections on Sundays
evening.
</P>
<P>
Final results of the vote were due late in the evening.
Projections at 9:00 P.M. local time (20:00 GMT) showed the CDU
with 43.3 per cent, up 4.1 per cent over 1995, with 39.3 per cent
for the SPD, a again of 1.3 per cent over from four years ago, and
Greens with 7.3 per cent, down from 11.2 per cent in 1995, FDP
with 5.2 per cent down from 7.4 per cent.
</P>
<P>
This would mean that conservative CDU and FDP would have 56
seats in the state parliament in Wiesbaden, compared to 54 for
Schroeder's SPD and the Greens.
</P>
<P>
After hovering at the crucial 5 per cent hurdle needed to win
seats in early projections, the tiny FDP appeared to have made the
leap back into parliament with 5.2 per cent of the vote, according
to ARD.
</P>
<P>
As strongest party the CDU was celebrating. "This is a
sensational result," said Siegfried Seitz, the Hesse state CDU
party manager. Former CDU German interior minister, Manfred
Kanther termed the election "a great success".
</P>
<P>
If the CDU replaces the SPD-led Hesse government this would
have a major impact in Bonn: the SPD would lose its majority in
the upper chamber of parliament, the Bundesrat.
</P>
<P>
Although the CDU would not gain a Bundesrat majority, Schroeder
would be forced to make compromises with the conservatives on much
government legislation to gain upper house approval.
</P>
<P>
CDU Secretary General Angela Merkel said if the CDU won Hesse,
her party would forces changes in Schroeder's law which will
reform Germany's 1913 bloodlines citizenship law.
</P>
<P>
"We say 'Ja' to integration but 'Nein' to dual-nationality,"
said Merkel.
</P>
<P>
Greens Hesse leader Tom Koenigs admitted defeat: "This is a
bitter loss," said Koenigs. The Greens saw their share of the vote
slump to 7.1 per cent - down from 11.2 per cent four years ago.
</P>
<P>
Hesse has been led by a coalition of Schroeder's SPD and the
Greens since 1991 under Prime Minister Hans Eichel.
</P>
<P>
The Hesse election was the first test of the SPD-Greens model
at the regional level since Schroeder set up an SPD-Green
coalition in Bonn after last September's federal election.

<HEADLINE> N.Irish Parties Urged to Break Deadlock </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, February 7 (Xinhua) -- The British government urged
both sides of Northern Ireland's divided community on Sunday to
break a deadlock over the scrapping of guerrilla weapons.
</P>
<P>
Britain's Northern Ireland Secretary, Mo Mowlam, said the march
10 deadline to start transferring legislative power may be missed
if the deadlock was not broken.
</P>
<P>
"We missed the Good Friday Agreement by a couple of days. We
may well miss this," she told BBC TV's Breakfast with Frost
program.
</P>
<P>
She acknowledged that the process crowned by last April's "Good
Friday" agreement was experiencing problems.
</P>
<P>
Mowlam said there was right on both sides of the dispute over
"decommissioning" of weapons, but that there was a need for
compromise between the pro-British Protestant majority and
pro-Irish republicans.
</P>
<P>
Northern Ireland's First Minister David Trimble, leader of the
Protestant Ulster Unionist Party, insists the Irish Republican
Army must give up weapons before its political arm Sinn Fein can
enter a new Northern Ireland executive to be set up under the
April accord.
</P>
<P>
"Now decommissioning is part of the Good Friday Agreement --
it's not a precondition but it is an obligation," Mowlam said.

<HEADLINE> Israel Blamed for Deadlock of Peace Process </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, February 7 (Xinhua) -- Arab League chief Esmat
Abdel-Meguid on Sunday held Israel responsible for the deadlock of
the Middle East peace process.
</P>
<P>
During a meeting with visiting Armenian Foreign Minister Vardan
Oskanyan, Abdel-Meguid accused Israel of adopting hardline
policies in the peace process, Egypt's Middle East News Agency
reported.
</P>
<P>
He blamed the stalemate of the peace march on Israel's failure
to honor the agreements signed with the Palestinians, the MENA
said.
</P>
<P>
Israel froze the latest peace deal, the Wye River accord, with
the Palestinians early December after carrying out the first of
the three-phased troops withdrawals from the West Bank as
stipulated in the agreement.
</P>
<P>
On the Iraqi crisis, Abdel-Meguid highlighted the Arab stance
expressed by a statement issued by an Arab foreign ministers'

CAIRO, February 7 (Xinhua) -- The following are economic briefs
from the Middle East countries.
</P>
<P>
SANAA -- General Yemeni Agro Services Foundation increased the
cotton land by 35,000 acres (14,170 hectares) in fresh areas so as
to meet the mounting foreign demand.
</P>
<P>
The present cotton-farmed acreage is about 90,400 acres (36,599
hectares) with the import-export bulk reaching 20 tonnes in 1998.
</P>
<P>
The Arabic daily Alalam Al-Youm quoted Abdullah Baashre, the
Foundation head, as saying that the government would buy a volume
of cotton worth 24.6 million to 30.3 million U.S. dollars from the
farmers last year.
</P>
<P>
ABU DHABI -- The United Arab Emirates (UAE) Industrial Bank
said the non-oil sector contributions to the gross domestic
production (GDP) rose by 6.5 percent to reach 36.7 billion dollars
last year.
</P>
<P>
The oil sector, on the other hand, earned 46.4 billion dollars
in 1998, 6 percent lower than in 1997.
</P>
<P>
RIYADH -- Sixty Saudi Arabian enterprises will take part in the
4th Arab African Trade Fair due in Dakar, Senegal, from April 15
to 25 under the auspices of the Organization of African Unity
(OAU), the Arab League and Senegal's government.
</P>
<P>
Sami Kurdi, secretary general of the Saudi Arabian Chambers
Council, said the fair will help open new marketing outlets for
Saudi products and boost the trade exchange between the kingdom
and the participant Arab and African states.
</P>
<P>
ABU DHABI -- With central banks in the Gulf considering
delinking their currencies with the U.S. dollar, the euro and the
yen pose the best prospects, a report by Gulf News said on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
"With the euro and the yen emerging as strong alternatives to
the dollar, Gulf countries are likely to place their reserves in
these currencies," the report said, quoting Paul Chertkow, head of
global currency research of Bank of Tokyo-Mitsubishi in London.
</P>
<P>
Speaking to reporters on Saturday after his presentation at a
seminar organized by the Japanese bank in Abu Dhabi, Chertkow said
the yen has a strong chance of being included in the basket of
currencies of the Gulf because Japan is the largest trading
partner of many Gulf countries including the United Arab Emirates.
