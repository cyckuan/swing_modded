Anson Chan welcomed here tonight the list of 23 principal
officials of the first government of the Hong Kong Special
Administrative Region (HKSAR), which was just released by Chief
Executive Tung Chee Hwa.
</P>
<P>
The Central People's Government has announced the appointment
of all eligible serving officers as principle officials of the
Hong Kong Special Administrative Region, in other words, Tung's
nominations have been accepted by the government, she said.
</P>
<P>
"I personally am very encouraged by this news. As you know,
these officials have been my colleagues for many, many years and I
have every confidence in their ability and their loyalty to Hong
Kong," said Chan, who will stay to assume the office of the
Administrative Secretary of the first HKSAR government.
</P>
<P>
Their appointment as principal officials will ensure the
continuity of top civil service during the transition period, Chan
noted.
</P>
<P>

service and by the entire community.
</P>
<P>
She also, on behalf of her colleagues, congratulated Elsie
Leung Oi-sie on her appointment as Secretary of Justice and Lily
Yam Kwan Pui-ying on her appointment as Commissioner Against
Corruption, and extended welcome to them.
</P>
<P>

join the civil service of HKSAR and to be appointed to the post.
</P>
<P>
"It is a great honor to be one of them and to be the first
Secretary of Justice -- the first Chinese Secretary of Justice of
the HKSAR," she said.
</P>
<P>
It is important for the Secretary of Justice to uphold the

<HEADLINE> Turkey Vows Continued Support for Palestinian </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ANKARA, February 20 (Xinhua) -- Turkish President Suleyman
Demirel said today that Turkey will continue its support for the
just cause of the Palestinian people.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a joint press conference here with visiting
Palestinian President Yasser Arafat following their talks,
Demirel emphasized that neither side of the Middle East peace
talks should not lose this golden opportunity because the process
was very important for peace and stability in the region.
</P>
<P>
He said that Turkey had attached great importance to the
implementation of the agreements between the Palestinian National
Authority (PNA) and Israel, adding that both sides should avoid
acts which might produce negative impact on the peace march.
</P>
<P>
On Israel's announcement to build new settlements in east
Jerusalem, Demirel said Turkey had criticized this move,
describing it as contradicting the principle of the PNA-Israeli
agreements.
</P>
<P>
The Turkish president was critical of Israel's blocking of
Palestinian workers from going to their jobs in Israel.
</P>
<P>
"While the world is coming to Palestine's aid economically,
the economic blockade by Israel is making the Palestinians lose
billions of dollars," he said.
</P>
<P>
Speaking on Turkish-Palestinian relations, Demirel said there
were no serious political problems between the two sides, adding
that Turkey was determined to further its relations with
Palestine.
</P>
<P>
In response, Arafat said the Turkish-Palestinian relations
were based on strategic, historical, contemporary and cultural
principles. He expressed his appreciation for Turkey's support in
their difficult days.
</P>
<P>
Arafat also voiced his gratitude to Turkey for its
participation in the international force monitoring the handover
of the West Bank town of Hebron.
</P>
<P>
The international force monitoring the handover of Hebron
includes troops from Denmark, Italy, Sweden, Switzerland, Norway
and Turkey.

<HEADLINE> US Housing Starts Up by 2 Percent in January </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, February 20 (Xinhua) -- U.S. housing starts rose by
2 percent in January helped by a surge in single-family activity,
U.S. Commerce Department reported today.
</P>
<P>
The department said that the construction of new homes and
apartments totaled 1.35 million at a seasonally adjusted annual
rate, up from the revised 1.32 million in December.
</P>
<P>
Single-family starts, about 80 percent of the total starting,
shot up by 10.2 percent to a 1.11 million rate, erasing a 11.3
percent loss in December.
</P>
<P>
But construction of apartments and condominiums, often volatile
but not as sensitive to interest-rate changes, plunged by 23.9
percent to a 242,000 rate after dropping 9.9 percent the previous
month.
</P>
<P>
Regionally, housing starts surged by 22.2 percent in the
Northeast and shot up by 29.8 percent in the West. But they fell
by 13.2 percent in the Midwest and off 6.8 percent in the South.
</P>
<P>
The report also said that applications for building permits --
often a barometer of future activity -- slipped by 1.9 percent in
January to a 1.40 million rate from 1.42 million a month earlier.
</P>
<P>
After setting an eight-year high in 1996, most analysts have
expected that U.S. housing construction would slow down this year
while still continuing at a strong level.
</P>
<P>
The department had reported previously that 1.47 million homes
and apartments were built last year, up from 1.35 million in 1995
and the highest level since 1.49 million in 1988.

<HEADLINE> EU to Remain in Contact with US on Helms-Burton </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BRUSSELS, February 20 (Xinhua) -- Sir. Leon Brittan, European
Commissioner for Foreign Trade, said the European Union(EU) would
remain in close bilateral contact with the US regarding the
controversial Helms-Burton Act following the nomination of the
panelists by the WTO Director-General on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
He said the two sides had made good progress but their
negotiation had not yet produced an outcome the EU considered
sufficient to suspend its action before the World Trade
Organization(WTO).
</P>
<P>
"This nomination is a purely procedural step which does not
signify a change of a gear in the EU's complaint against the
Helms-Burton Act," Sir. Leon said in a statement.
</P>
<P>
He said the fact that the Panel was becoming operational "in no
way limits our ability to continue bilateral negotiations", adding
that "further clarification, examination and discussion are
needed".
</P>
<P>
"Of course the Panel procedure can be halted or suspended at
any time if the parties reach agreement," the Commissioner said.
</P>
<P>
The Helm-Burton Act allows naturalized US citizens to sue
foreign firms or individuals doing business with Cuba.
</P>
<P>
Because of strong opposition from US's major trade partners
including EU, Canada and Mexico, US President Clinton has twice
suspended that provision for six months - the last time on January
3.
</P>
<P>
The EU has condemned this Act as "extraterritorial" and
decided in last October to take the matter to the WTO dispute
settlement panel.

<HEADLINE> Non-Communist Personages Mourn Deng's Death (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, February 20 (Xinhua) -- Leaders of China's
non-Communist parties and the All-China Federation of Industry and
Commerce, and personages without party affiliations today mourned
the death of Deng Xiaoping, who passed away Wednesday night in
Beijing.
</P>
<P>
They recalled the outstanding achievements and contributions of
the 93-year-old Deng, paying the utmost respect and expressing
their heartfelt grief over his death.
</P>
<P>
Lei Jieqiong, vice-chairwoman of the Standing Committee of the
National People's Congress (NPC), China's legislature, and
chairwoman of the Central Committee of the China Association for
Promoting Democracy, said that Deng is recognized by the Chinese
people of all ethnic groups, including the non-Communist parties,
as an outstanding leader with high prestige.
</P>
<P>
Under the guidance of Deng's theory of building socialism with
Chinese characteristics and the Party's basic line, she noted,
China's economic construction has achieved unprecedented success,
and profound changes have taken place in the country.
</P>
<P>
"If it were not for Comrade Deng Xiaoping, China would not have
had the reforms, opening up, and socialist modernization
construction, just as there would not have been a socialist New
China without the late Chairman Mao Zedong," she noted.
</P>
<P>
Her views were shared by Cheng Siyuan, vice chairman of the NPC
Standing Committee and a non-party personage, and Yang Jike,
executive vice chairman of the Central Committee of the China Zhi
Gong Party, who pointed out that the great merits of Deng in the
fields of economy, politics, diplomacy, education, science and
technology, culture, and military affairs have not only been
remembered in the hearts of Chinese people of various ethnic
groups, but also earned him a high reputation among the overseas
Chinese.
</P>
<P>
"He devoted his entire life to the motherland and the people,
and people of the motherland love and adore him," they added.
</P>
<P>
Ding Shisun, chairman of the Central Committee of the China
Democratic League, said that Deng's theory of building socialism
with Chinese characteristics is deeply rooted in Chinese people's
hearts and across China's vast territory.
</P>
<P>
He recalled the National Day parade in Beijing in 1984, when
young students from Beijing University unfolded a banner on which
was written the words "Hello, Xiaoping."
</P>
<P>
"I was then president of the university, and therefore knew it
was a sheer voluntary act by the students," he noted. "It
reflected the sincere love and esteem for Comrade Deng Xiaoping
among people from various ethnic groups of China, as well as their
hearty support for the Party's lines, principles, and policies
since the third plenum of the 11th CPC Central Committee."

<HEADLINE> Kenyan Govt Urged to Protect Sugar Industry </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, February 20 (Xinhua) -- An industrial official has
appealed to the Kenyan government to protect local sugar
companies from unscrupulous importers.
</P>
<P>
At a press conference held on Wednesday in Kisumu, western
Kenya, Norman Brooks, National Vice-Chairman of the Federation of
Kenya Employers, said that local sugar companies are now having
70,000 tons of sugar in store.
</P>
<P>
The amount of sugar is unable to sell due to the flooding of
Kenyan market with cheap imported sugar, he pointed out.
</P>
<P>
The official noted that imported sugar from Brazil, Thailand,
Mauritius, South Africa and Swaziland meant for neighboring
countries is being diverted to the local market at low prices
because no duty has been paid.
</P>
<P>
Unless the government intervened to save the local companies,
Brooks said, more than 30,000 employees in the sugar industry
which is the main economic activities in western Kenya would lose
their jobs.
</P>
<P>
Some of the sugar factories have now been forced to reduce
their prices so as to remain in business, said the official,
adding that only the best managed companies could survive even if
their sugar is sold at the current price.
</P>
<P>
He pointed out that local sugar could compete with imported
sugar only if the government ensures that all imports are
authorized by the Kenya Sugar Authority and all duties and levies
are paid.
</P>
<P>
If the industry dies, the official stressed, about two million
people would lose their source of income.

<P>
JOHANNESBURG, February 20 (Xinhua) -- Director General of the
National Intelligence Agency of South Africa Sizakele Sigxashe
today said his agency is watching closely foreign secret agents
flooding into the country.
</P>
<P>
The intelligence chief told a press conference in Cape Town
that some of the agents appear bent on subverting the government
of President Nelson Mandela.
</P>
<P>
He asserted that the number of foreign spies operating in
South Africa has doubled or trebled since the country's first
non-racial general elections in April 1994.
</P>
<P>
Sigxashe said all foreign embassies in the country have
declared their officials to security agencies here. But other
missions are yet to do so.
</P>
<P>
He claimed that many foreign spy agencies have moved their
African monitoring posts elsewhere in the continent to this
country since the 1994 polls.
</P>
<P>
These secret agents are interested in economic and
technological intelligence and some have taken particular
interest in arms programs here, he stressed.

<P>
The central leaders of the non-communist parties had close
contacts with Deng Xiaoping, and enjoyed true friendship with him.
</P>
<P>
With deep feeling, and based on their personal experiences,
they recalled Deng's careful concern for various non-communist
parties and non-party figures over the past dozens of years,
viewing him as an important member of the first generation of the
leadership of the Chinese Communist Party (CPC) and the core of
the second generation of the leadership of the CPC.
</P>
<P>
Wu Jieping, Vice Chairman of the Standing Committee of the
National People's Congress (NPC) and Chairman of the Central
Committee of the Jiu San (September 3) Society, as well as Qian
Weichang, Vice Chairman of the Chinese People's Political
Consultative Conference and Honorary Chairman of the Central
Committee of the China Democratic League, reviewed Deng's
tremendous contributions to the development of China's scientific,
technological and educational undertakings.
</P>
<P>
Lu Jiaxi, Vice Chairman of the NPC Standing Committee and
Chairman of the Central Committee of the Chinese Peasants and
Workers Democratic Party, added that Deng believed scientific work
was of greatest importance.
</P>
<P>
When meeting with scientists who had developed China's
electron-positron collider, Deng told them that in the process of
socialist modernization, the question of scientific development
should be thoroughly considered, and those scientific projects
that are prominent on the international scene should be developed
vigorously, according to Lu.
</P>
<P>

HARARE, February 20 (Xinhua) -- The International Organization

African countries that have made great strides in protecting
consumer rights.
</P>
<P>
IOCU program coordinator for eastern and southern Africa

Zimbabwe and South Africa were the only African countries that
had embraced United Nations guidelines on consumer protection.
</P>

She said out of the 56 countries involved in the study, the
two southern African countries were the only ones with active
consumer rights watchdogs through the Consumer Council of
Zimbabwe (CCZ) and South African Consumer Coordination Council.
</P>

She noted, however, that there is need to come up with
comprehensive consumer legislations to ensure easy implementation
of consumer laws, adding that at present most statutes are
administered by different government ministries.

<HEADLINE> WHO Recommends Three Virus Strains Against Influenza </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GENEVA, February 20 (Xinhua) -- The World Health Organization
(WHO) has recommended three virus strains that should be used to
produce vaccines for the 1997-1998 influenza season.
</P>
<P>
At a meeting of international experts held on Wednesday at the
WHO headquarters in Geneva, the group of influenza experts advised
national health authorities and pharmaceutical companies on the
three selected virus strains, a type A (H3N2) strain, a type A
(H1N1) and a type B strain.
</P>
<P>
As in previous years, the specific viruses used in vaccine
manufacturing in each country will need to be approved by the
national control authorities.
</P>
<P>
"Influenza causes epidemics worldwide every year. WHO strongly
recommends the use of vaccine as a sound preventive measure
against this potentially fatal disease," WHO says, adding:
"Special attention should be paid to vaccinate the elderly,
individuals with immunodeficiency, sufferers of chronic diseases
of the heart or lungs as well as diabetes and other metabolic
disorders."
</P>
<P>
The detection of new influenza viruses is made possible through
the WHO network for influenza surveillance and control. This
network helps WHO monitor influenza activity in all regions of the
world and ensures that WHO receives influenza virus isolates and
information needed to select the new variants which will be used
to produce influenza vaccines for the next influenza season.
</P>
<P>
According to WHO, the epidemics in many countries reached a
peak around the end of December 1996 or during January 1997. In
central and eastern Europe, influenza activity increased around
mid-January.
</P>
<P>
Influenza A viruses were isolated worldwide and were almost
exclusively of the influenza A (H3N2) subtype. However, most
influenza virus isolates from Asia were influenza B with the
exception of Japan, where influenza A (H3N2) predominated. In
North America and parts of Europe, influenza B was frequently
reported, either along with influenza A or following the decline
of influenza A activity. Only a few laboratory confirmed cases of
influenza A (H1N1) have been reported so far this season.

ATHENS, February 20 (Xinhua) -- Stock prices soared to a six-
year high at the Athens Stock Exchange today with the general
price index closing at 1,306.46 points, up 1.6 percent.
</P>
<P>
Stocks have been gearing up for the assault on the 1,300 point
barrier since the beginning of the year, with profits increasing
by 40 percent. The general price index last broke through the
1,300 point barrier in April, 1991.
</P>
<P>
The bullish sentiment is primarily due to the significant fall
in inflation rates, which is expected to continue this month. The
subsequent fall in interest rates and the government's intention
to speed up privatization of state-run firms.
</P>
<P>
Investment interest at today's session was centred on bank
stocks, which saw an increase of 3.44 percent.

Turnover was also impressively high, totaling 23 billion

Guangying, Vice-chairman of NPC Standing Committee and ACFIC
honorary chairman Sun Fuling, and ACFIC chairman Jing Shuping
recalled the kind attention and guidance Deng gave to former
industrialists and businessmen.
</P>
<P>
They said that Deng met with several industrial and commercial
leaders soon after the Third Plenum of the 11th CPC Central
Committee, and pointed out that the role of former industrialists
and businessmen should be given full play in the construction of
socialist modernization, to show clearly in which direction the
ACFIC should go.
</P>
<P>
Since the reform and opening to the outside world, an economic
structure based on public ownership and supplemented with
multi-ownerships has formed in China. The healthy development of
non-public ownership has contributed to the economic growth and
social progress.
</P>
<P>
"That cannot be separated from the principles and policies made
by Deng Xiaoping," they said.
</P>
<P>
The non-Communist persons said that though Deng has died, he
will live forever in their hearts. The blueprint he designed for
the country's reform and opening is being carried out step by step
by people all over the country who are led by the CPC Central
Committee with Comrade Jiang Zemin at the core.
</P>
<P>
"We should turn grief into strength, and unite more closely
around the CPC Central Committee with Jiang at the core, so as to
contribute more to the construction of socialist modernization and
reunification of the motherland," they said.

<HEADLINE> UK Hospital Waiting Lists Grow to 1.1 million </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, February 20 (Xinhua) -- The number of patients waiting
for hospital treatment in England is rising, with waiting lists up
by over three percent to a record high of 1.1 million at the end
of December, official figures showed Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The Department of Health (DH) said that the total number of
people waiting, the number waiting for less than a year, the
number waiting for more than a year and the number waiting over 18
months have all increased in England.
</P>
<P>
There was a 3.2 percent rise in the overall numbers in the
three months from September to December 1996, giving a total of
1,096,000.
</P>
<P>
The rise included a sharp jump in patients waiting for more
than a year, an increase of 6,900, or 46 percent, to 21,900.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the number of patients waiting for more than 18
months, breaching the government's guarantee under the Patient's
Charter, rose from 25 to 123.
</P>
<P>
The DH said that a four percent increase in emergency
admissions this winter forced hospitals to cancel and delay
non-urgent treatments.
</P>
<P>
Philip Hunt, director of the National Association of Health
Authorities and Trusts, said that financial difficulty was another
factor leading to the rise of the waiting lists, with the National
Health Service struggling this year to cope with its toughest
financial settlement for a decade.
</P>
<P>
It is reported that official figures for the current quarter
may well show a further deterioration.
</P>
<P>
Analysts said that while the increases were relatively small,
they were a setback for the government in the run-up to the
general election.

HONG KONG, February 20 (Xinhua) -- More than 2,000 Hong Kong
citizens went to the mourning hall at the Xinhua News Agency Hong
Kong Branch this afternoon to offer their condolences to Chinese
leader Deng Xiaoping, who passed away Wednesday night.
</P>
<P>
Inside the mourning hall hung a photograph of the deceased
along with a banner inscribed with "Esteemed Deng Xiaoping is
immortal". Wreaths were placed in front of the photo and around
the hall.
</P>
<P>
After three o'clock this afternoon, the grief-loaded mourners
moved in batches into the hall to pay their last respect to the
great man. Some could not help crying for the loss of the chief
architect of China's reform and opening-up and modernization
drive. It is estimated that some 2,000 people paid their tributes
to Deng within two hours.
</P>
<P>
Ann Tse-kai and Henry Fok Ying-tong, both vice chairmen of the
Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference (CPPCC)

Deng.
</P>
<P>
Ann Tse-kai recalled his meeting with Deng several years ago in
 Beijing. He said: "The concept of 'one country, two systems'
and 'Hong Kong people ruling Hong Kong' is a pioneering
undertaking. It is a pity that Deng could not see with his own
eyes the moment Hong Kong returns to China."
</P>
<P>
Henry Fok Ying-tong felt deeply grieved about Deng's death. He
described Deng as a great leader of the Chinese people, who not
only chartered the course of reform and opening-up, but also put
forward the creative concept of "one country, two systems" to
successfully resolve the Hong Kong issue.
</P>
<P>
Rita Fan, the PLC president, expressed her wishes to fulfill
the obligations of the PLC step by step, so as to fully implement

great man is to continue the reform and opening up to the outside

the third-generation leadership with President Jiang Zemin at the

Entitled "Immortal is Deng Xiaoping, the son of the Chinese

architect of China's reform and opening policy and modernization
process, and the founder of the theory of building socialism with
Chinese characteristics. The article says that Hong Kong people
are grateful to Deng because his scientific concept of "one
country, two systems" has laid down a solid basis for the
long-term stability and prosperity of Hong Kong.
</P>
<P>
In Hong Kong today, the death of Deng Xiaoping has caused
strong reactions. Many people stayed before TV sets for hours to

<HEADLINE> German Central Bank Leaves Key Rates Unchanged </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BONN, February 20 (Xinhua) -- Germany's central bank left its
key interest rates unchanged today, and experts believe latest
fundamental price and monetary data has made any rate cut unlikely
at present.
</P>
<P>
The Bundesbank's discount rate remains at 2.5 percent and the
Lombard at 4.5 percent. The last cut in these two rates occurred
in mid-April 1996, each by half a point.
</P>
<P>
The Lombard rate is the ceiling at which the central bank lends
to commercial banks, and the discount rate generally is the lower
rate it makes available to meet bank liquidity needs.
</P>
<P>
The third key rate, the security repurchase offer, was kept at
3.0 percent, where it has been since last August.
</P>
<P>
The Bundesbank Chief Wednesday said he did not rule out the
possibility to introduce further cuts in the key rates. However,
experts believe that the latest fundamental price and monetary
data has made such change unlikely at this time.
</P>
<P>
The Bundesbank earlier today reported that the broad-based M3
money supply soared by 11.7 percent in January over the level of
the fourth quarter of 1996. The target corridor it has set for the
M3 supply expansion is at 3.5 to 6.5 percent in 1997.
</P>
<P>
The wholesale prices in January disclosed today registered the
highest monthly jump in 18 months, with an increase of 1.2 percent
over December.
</P>
<P>
In addition, official data released last week showed that
overall inflation last month grew by 1.5 percent from December,
boosting the annual price rise rate to 1.8 percent, compared with
1.4 percent in December.

<HEADLINE> Bonn Remains Optimistic Over Economic Forecast </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BONN, February 20 (Xinhua) -- Germany remains optimistic over
its economic forecast for 1997 and will be able to meet the strict
criteria necessary for joining the single European currency, said
German Economics Minister Guenter Rexrodt today.
</P>
<P>
"I stand by the key data of the annual economic report: 2.5
percent gross domestic product (GDP) growth in 1997, after 1.4
percent last year," Rexrodt told the German parliament despite
pessimistic reports on the country's economic outlook,
</P>
<P>
Rexrodt stressed that Germany will meet the debt and budget
deficit criteria set for the planned 1999 single currency.
</P>
<P>
Under the Maastricht Treaty for the European Union's single
currency program, the budget deficit and national debt of a member
country must not exceed 3 and 60 percent respectively of its GDP.
</P>
<P>
"The single currency must and will be as stable as the German
mark," the German news agency DPA quoted Rexrodt as saying.
</P>
<P>
Germany's central bank, known as Deutsche Bandesbank, Wednesday
said that in the fourth quarter of 1996, Germany's GDP showed
virtually zero growth, and possibly a decline, compared with the
third quarter.
</P>
<P>
The Institute for the German Economy (DIW), one of the six
leading independent economic research institutes in the country,
also said Wednesday that it was revising its January projection of
a slight increase for the economy and now expects a 0.25 percent
decline in the first quarter of 1997 compared with the last
quarter of 1996.
</P>
<P>
Germany's unemployment soared to a past-war record of nearly
4.66 million in January. Other disappointing data include
declining consumption, a recession in the building sector and
sluggish investments.
</P>
<P>
The central bank said the only bright spot in the whole picture
was foreign demand which had kept export strong, a trend supported
by the softer German mark.
</P>
<P>
The DIW said that the performance of German export will be a
key factor to decide whether the economy will drop into recession
or not in the second quarter.

several times, many residents were in tears.
</P>
<P>
"He inspected our store on the night of the Lantern Festival in
1992, and shook hands with me. I will never forget the
experience," said Ma Guining, a shop assistant at one of the
biggest stores on Nanjing Road in Shanghai.
</P>
<P>
"The festival is approaching. However, he passed away,..." she
added, crying.
</P>
<P>

newly-built bridges, Nanpu and Yangpu, said that he will remember
Deng's three inspection tours to the construction sites of the
bridges.

portrait of Deng.
</P>
<P>
In south China's Hainan Province, many pedestrians in the
capital city of Haikou wore black suits and white flowers to
symbolize their respect for Deng.
</P>
<P>
"We workers at the forefront of the reform love Deng because
the policies he drafted have benefitted us," said Feng Xiuzheng, a
53-year-old worker in Haikou who said she cherishes his memory.
</P>
<P>
People in many other provinces such as Hunan, Gansu and Guizhou
in central, northwest and southwest China also expressed their
sorrow.
</P>
<P>
Yan Hongchang, a deputy to the Provincial People's Congress of
east China's Anhui Province, said that the current good situation
in the country's rural areas should be attributed to Deng.

The Supreme People's Court issued a circular calling for strict
law enforcement and safeguarding social stability. The Supreme
People's Procuratorate called a meeting to mourn the death of
Deng, asking procuratorates at various levels to stick to the path
of reform, development and stability.
</P>
<P>
At a meeting of the Chinese People's Political Consultative
Conference, officials recalled Deng's great deeds as well as his
revolutionary spirit.
</P>
<P>
The All-China Federation of Trade Unions, the Central Committee

mourning Deng's death.
</P>
<P>
Officials from the Hong Kong and Macao Affairs Office of the
State Council, The Taiwan Work Office of the Chinese Communist
Party Central Committee, and the Taiwan Affairs Office of the
State Council expressed their sorrow.
</P>
<P>
They said that Deng died just little over 100 days before the
return of Hong Kong to the motherland. "We must mourn Deng by
working hard," they vowed.
</P>
<P>
Today, China's national flags were flown at half staff at
Tiananmen, Xinhuamen, the Great Hall of the People and the Foreign
Ministry.
</P>
<P>
At a meeting held by the Beijing Municipal People's Congress,
deputies stood and observed three minutes of silence.
</P>
<P>
"Comrade Deng Xiaoping's contributions to the Chinese
revolution and construction were invaluable," said Tao Xiping,
from the congress, adding that Deng's words and deeds will have
great influence on China's future.
</P>
<P>
When the news of Deng's death reached old revolutionary regions
where Deng had fought and worked, including Guangxi, Jiangxi, and
Shanxi, the public were deeply saddened.
</P>
<P>
Li Xianxian, 86, an old Red Army soldier who took part in the
Baise Uprising led by Deng, was choked with tears as he stood in
front of Deng's picture.
</P>
<P>
In Jiangxi Province, people came to a factory where Deng worked
when he was fired during the chaotic Cultural Revolution
(1966-76), to mourn the late leader.
</P>
<P>
"Deng worked here with us for three years," said Tao Duanjin, a
worker. "His optimism and will-power impressed me most."

ideas on the construction of socialism with Chinese
characteristics.

<HEADLINE> Dutch Crime Falls Last Yera: Report </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BRUSSELS, February 20 (Xinhua) -- The number of most frequently
committed crimes in the Netherlands declined across the board last
year, the Dutch daily newspaper Het Financieele Dagblad reported
on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Quoting figures from the national statistics office CBS, the
newspaper reported that the police registered four million
incidents of theft, assault, vandalism and hit-and-run accidents
in 1996, half a million less than the previous year.
</P>
<P>
CBS said this was the largest decline in crime figures since it
began collecting statistics in 1980.
</P>
<P>
There were some 1.67 million reports of theft in 1996 by
victims aged over 15, or 300,000 fewer than in 1995. Incidents of
assault declined by 120,000 to 722,000.
</P>
<P>
Reports of vandalism declined by 49,000 to 1.45 million last
year, and there were 164,000 hit-and-run accidents, compared with
188,000 the previous year.
</P>
<P>
CBS attributed the sharp drop in crime to an increase in
anti-theft measures.

BELGRADE, February 20 (Xinhua) -- Yugoslavia's Tanjug News

achievements of late Chinese leader Deng Xiaoping.
</P>
<P>
The commentary described Deng, who died Wednesday, as the
father of China's reforms and opening up to the outside world, and
a historic figure be be remembered by people around the world.

characteristics as a practice of combining Marxism with the real
situation in China, the commentary said the theory revitalized
socialism for the world.

<P>
With pragmatic policies and great visions, Deng led the
People's Republic through its worst period since its founding and
resuscitated the nation from its paralyzed state resulting from
the Cultural Revolution, it said.
</P>
<P>
As a result of Deng's polices, China commenced the "real and

<HEADLINE> US, Qatar to Hold Air Exercises </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ABU DHABI, February 20 (Xinhua) -- The United States and Qatar
will hold joint air exercises during the deployment of a U.S. Air
Expeditionary Force (AEF) in Qatar, according to reports
reaching here from Qatar today.
</P>
<P>
"There will be joint air exercises between the Air Forces of
the United States and Qatar in the Qatari air space (during the
deployment of the U.S. AEF)," the Qatari news agency quoted
commander of the U.S. 4th Air Expeditionary Wing Lanes Smith as
saying.
</P>
<P>
The deployment, which includes 30 fighter aircraft and more
than 1,000 airmen, began today and will last through May to
support Operation Southern Watch upholding the United Nations'
sanctions against Iraq.
</P>
<P>
The United Nations has imposed embargoes on Iraq since 1991
after the U.S.-led allied forces launched the Gulf War to drive
the Iraqi troops out of Kuwait.
</P>
<P>
Lanes gave no details about the joint exercises between the
U.S. AEF and Qatari Air Force, but U.S. Ambassador in Qatar
Patrick Nicolas Theros told reporters that the exercises were
aimed at improving the fighting capacity of the U.S. and Qatari
air forces.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. and Qatar have maintained close military ties
since 1992 following the signing of a defense cooperation
agreement by the two sides.

<TEXT>
<P>
BRUSSELS, February 20 (Xinhua) -- Belgium does not plan to
provide information to the Netherlands on interest earned on
Belgian-based bank accounts, a Belgian finance ministry spokesman
was quoted by Thursday's Dutch daily newspaper Het Financieele
Dagblad as saying.
</P>
<P>
The spokesman said that talks are being held on a new tax
treaty between the two countries, but that the data exchange issue
has been scrapped from the agenda.
</P>
<P>
On Tuesday, Dutch finance minister Gerrit Zalm has told
parliament that Dutch and Belgian taxation authorities were
examining ways to provide automatic access to each other's tax
data, including information on bank accounts. The Dutch finance
ministry said on Wednesday it had nothing to add to Zalm's
statement of the previous day.
</P>
<P>
Zalm's comments were made after Dutch parliament members
questioned a recent advertisement by Belgian bank Kredit aan de
Nijverheid, part of the Dutch-Belgian Fortis Group, calling on
Dutch savers to deposit their money in Belgium.
</P>
<P>
Zalm told parliament Dutch banks had already agreed to refrain
from cross-border advertising in order not to encourage tax
evasion and that he had asked Fortis to apply the agreement to its
foreign subsidiaries.

<HEADLINE> Egypt to Offer Aid to Refugees in Zambia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, February 20 (Xinhua) -- Egypt will offer material
assistance to the refugees in Zambia, who have been driven out of
their countries by civil wars, Egyptian Education Minister Hussein
Bahaa Eddine said today.
</P>
<P>
Eddin told reporters that President Hosni Mubarak received a
message from Zambian President Frederich Chiluba earlier today on
the present events in the Great Lakes area, which was delivered
by Zambian Education Minister Syamukayumbu Syamujaye who is
currently visiting here.
</P>
<P>
In the message, Chiluba asked Egypt for help in settling its
unsolved problems represented by the daily flow of about 500
refugees since last year from Rwanda and Zaire, the Egyptian MENA
news agency quoted the Zambian official as saying after meeting
with Eddine today.
</P>
<P>
This situation has negatively affected Zambia's economy and
Zambia is looking forward to Egypt's interference in helping the
country through diplomatic channels besides its material
assistance, Chiluba said.
</P>
<P>
Thousands of Zairians have flocked into neighboring Zambia and
Tanzania in search of shelter, after a civil war led by ethnic
Tutsis in eastern Zaire broke out last September. Many face
starvation in refugee camps with terrible living conditions.
</P>
<P>
Burundi, Rwanda, Zaire, Uganda and Tanzania, known as the Great
Lakes area of Africa, have been involved in other rising
hostilities.
</P>
<P>
These conflicts have resulted in millions of refugees and
displaced people.
</P>
<P>
Egypt has been seeking a settlement to the conflicts of the
African countries within the framework of the Organization of
African Unity.

<HEADLINE> Angola to Disarm Nearly 100,000 Soldiers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUANDA, February 20 (Xinhua) -- Angola is set to spend 21
million U.S. Dollars to disarm nearly 100,000 grown-up fighters
of the once warring parties in the five-month period starting from
March 1.
</P>
<P>
The joint committee overseeing Angola's peace process approved
here today a plan on quick demobilization of adult servicemen
around the southern African country, said U.N. Envoy to Angola
Blondin Beye.
</P>
<P>
The top challenge facing the plan is how to have the
opposition National Union for the Total Independence of Angola
(UNITA) join the formation of the united army, Beye noted.
</P>
<P>
Without the involvement of UNITA, the plan will be impossible
to be carried out, he said.
</P>
<P>
He added the Angolan government has passed a budget to ensure
adequate money for the demobilization.
</P>
<P>
As many as 2,029 child fighters in the country have so far
been disarmed and returned to civil lives since last September
and the work will continue, said Beye. enditem

<HEADLINE> Civilian Killed in Israeli Bombardment in S. </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIRUT, February 20 (Xinhua) -- One civilian was killed in
Israeli bombardment in south Lebanon this afternoon, at a time
when a cease-fire monitoring committee is discusing a Lebanese
complaint against the Jewish state.
</P>
<P>
Israeli artillery has hit at suspected guerrilla targets in
south Lebanon since this morning, following a clash between
Lebanese guerrillas and an Israeli patrol in the Israeli
self-proclaimed "security zone."
</P>
<P>
Police sources in south Lebanon said that the Israeli
occupation forces concentrated the bombardment on the areas of
Iglim Al-Toffah and Nabatiyeh.
</P>
<P>
The sources added that the Israeli artillery, at the
position of Zaffata, fired at vicinities of the south Lebanese
villages of Froum, Khandurieyh, Zautar Gharbieh and Zautar
Sharqieh in Nabatiyeh, some 75 kilometers southeast of Beirut.
</P>
<P>
A shepherd identified as Khodraj Hadi, 25, from the village of
Froum was killed by a shell around 14:30 p.m. (12:30 GMT) when he
was herding goats and sheep near Froum, according to the
sources.
</P>
<P>
The incident happened when a five-nation group monitoring a
cease-fire between Lebanon and Israel is holding a meeting in
the south Lebanese border town of Naqoura to discuss a Lebanese
complaint over the killing of a Lebanese woman in Israeli
bombardment Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Naeemeh Hallal, 33, was the first Lebanese civilian killed by
Israeli forces this year.
</P>
<P>
The cease-fire monitoring committee, comprising
representatives of France, Israel, Lebanon, Syria and the United
States, was set up under the April 1996 understanding, which
bars belligerent parties in south Lebanon from targeting
civilians.
</P>
<P>
The group started the meeting in the headquarters of the
U.N. peacekeeping forces Wednesday afternoon.
</P>
<P>
In a related development, the pro-Syrian Amal Movement of
Lebanon announced that its guerrillas ambushed this morning an
Israeli patrol in the central sector of the border strip,
killing and wounding several Israeli soldiers. But there was no
confirmation from the Israeli side.
</P>
<P>
Amal, headed by Lebanese House Speaker Nabih Berri, said in a
statement that the guerrillas detonated a series of bombs at
4:15 a.m. (02:15 GMT) when an Israeli Merkava tank carrying a
number of infantrymen arrived at the site of ambush.
</P>
<P>
Guerrillas of the pro-Iranian Hezbollah, or Party of God,
also said that they launched an attack at a position of the
Israeli-backed SLA militia at Tomat Niha in the border strip
this morning.
</P>
<P>
Hit-and-run attacks by Lebanese Muslim guerrillas and
bombardments by Israeli forces constitute a daily scene in south
Lebanon, the last active battlefront of the Arab-Israeli
conflict.
</P>
<P>
Lebanese guerrillas have killed one Israeli soldier and
wounded 22 others since this year.
</P>
<P>
Israel established the 1,100-square-kilometer buffer strip in
1985 in a bid to protect northern Israel from cross-border
attacks.

LAGOS, February 20 (Xinhua) -- Nigeria registered a two
percent drop in consumer prices in December, leaving a lower
price hike rate in 1996 than in 1995.
</P>
<P>
The data released today by Federal Office of Statistics (FOS)
showed that the composite consumer price index in the western
African country stood at 2,668.6 in December, compared with
2,722.7 in November.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, urban and rural indices fell by 1.2 percent and 2.1
percent respectively.
</P>
<P>
The decline is largely due to the fall of prices of food and
materials for housing repair, FOS said.
</P>
<P>
Between December 1995 and December 1996, the nation's average
consumer price level rose by 14.3 percent, according to FOS

<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, February 20 (Xinhua) -- Israeli Prime Minister
Binyamin Netanyahu today held talks with visiting Chinese
Vice-Premier Li Lanqing on bilateral ties and issues of mutual
interest.
</P>
<P>
During the talks, Netanyahu expressed condolences over the
death of Deng Xiaoping, who passed away Wednesday evening.
</P>
<P>
He said that the Israeli people shared with the Chinese people
their grief over the passing away of Deng, whom he lauded as "one
of the great leaders in the 20th century."
</P>
<P>
Li thanked Netanyahu and the Israeli government for their
condolences over the death of Deng Xiaoping.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese vice-premier said that, under the leadership of
President Jiang Zemin and the Central Committee of the Chinese
Communist Party, China will continue moving forward along the
path of modernization, reform and open-door policy, which has
been directed by Deng Xiaoping.
</P>
<P>
On the relations between China and Israel, Li said that China
hopes to promote comprehensive relations with Israel, especially
in trade and economic fields.
</P>

million U.S. dollars in 1996.

<TEXT>
<P>
OTTAWA, February 20 (Xinhua) -- Retail sales in Canada dipped
0.3 percent in December after three months of strong growth,
Statistics Canada said today.
</P>
<P>
Four of seven trade sectors saw increases in retail sales in
the month. Growth was the strongest in drug stores, followed by
clothing and food. Losses in general merchandise and furniture
offset the gains.
</P>
<P>
Despite the drop in December, retail sales in the last two
months of the year went up to 27.4 billion U.S. dollars, about 4.5
percent more than in the last two Christmas seasons, the federal
fact-gathering agency said.
</P>

<HEADLINE> HK Properties Tycoon Mourns Deng's Death </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, February 21 (Xinhua) -- "I'm much grieved at hearing
Deng's death. Although it had been talked for a certain period
that his health was not so good, the news still took me by
surprise," Hong Kong property tycoon Li Ka-shing told Xinhua
today.
</P>
<P>
Deng Xiaoping died Wednesday night in Beijing at the age of 93.
</P>
<P>
To the 1.2 billion Chinese people, Deng was "a very great
man," Li said with deep sorrow.
</P>
<P>
Recalling his many meetings with Deng, the head of Cheung Kong
(Holdings) Ltd. spoke highly of Deng's great contributions.
</P>
<P>
Li said that the esteemed leader had creativity and
far-sightedness on many issues.
</P>
<P>
Not only the Chinese inland areas but also Hong Kong benefited
from his policy, which brought about a vigorous economy, a
rapidly growing national gross product, and a mounting national
strength, he said.
</P>
<P>
"The glory of his achievements will shine through the ages," Li
noted.
</P>
<P>
Li went Thursday to the mourning hall at the Xinhua New Agency
Hong Kong Branch to pay homage to the deceased.
</P>
<P>
Deng's another contribution to the country and to the Chinese
nation was the "one country, two systems" concept, which led to
the successful settlement of the Hong Kong issue, said Li
Ka-shing, who is also a member of the Preparatory Committee for
the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region and a Hong Kong
Affairs Advisor.
</P>
<P>
It should be attributed to Deng's wisdom and foresight that
Hong Kong maintains prosperity and stability during the transition
period and that the local people have full confidence in future,
he pointed out.
</P>
<P>
However, he voiced deep regret that Deng couldn't see with his
eyes the historic moment when Hong Kong returns to the motherland
on July 1, 1997.
</P>
<P>
Deng's passing away hasn't triggered political and economic
turbulence in China, and this testifies to Deng's vision, Li
continued.
</P>
<P>
In recent years, under the guidance of the third-generation
leadership with President Jiang Zemin at its core, China has
recorded a double-digit economic growth with inflation reined
in, an improvement in people's living standards, and an enhanced
status in the international community, he said.
</P>
<P>
"It is foreseeable that China will be an amazing economic power
in the next century, which will prove the capability of China's
third-generation leadership in governing the country," Li
stressed.
</P>
<P>
"I myself, my family and my company have full confidence in
Hong Kong's future because China is full of vigor and hope," he
said.
</P>
<P>
"The best way for me to commemorate Deng is to stay in Hong
Kong and contribute my share to the education and medical work on
the mainland," Li Ka-shing concluded.

KATHMANDU, February 21 (Xinhua) -- Nepal is to receive
financial assistance of about 80-90 million U.S. dollars annually
from the Asian Development Bank (ADB) in the next few years up to
2000, according to the bank today.
</P>
<P>
In addition, the ADB will also provide technical assistance
grants totaling about 5 million dollars every year to Nepal, an
official of the bank told a press conference here today.
</P>
<P>
These amounts would not include any ADB loans supporting
large-sized hydropower projects in Nepal.
</P>
<P>
Under a three-year cycle program, the ADB will provide
financial support to three projects in Nepal every year up to
2000, ADB program manager in Nepal Yoshihiro Iwasaki said.
</P>
<P>
For 1997, a total of 110 million dollars have been earmarked
for three projects on community groundwater irrigation, airport
improvement and agriculture program respectively, he said.
</P>
<P>
The ADB official said the bank will assist Nepal in the next
three years in achieving its goals in areas of debenture market,
road improvement, human resources development, tourism and poverty
alleviation.
</P>
<P>
He also stressed the need for Nepal to pay attention to
clearing hurdles caused by the absence of infrastructures and
policy improvement as the country has not been able to attract
foreign investment compared with other Asian countries.

<HEADLINE> Progress Made in Military Dialogue in Cyprus: U.N. </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NICOSIA, February 21 (Xinhua) -- U.N. official has said that
progress has been made in the indirect military dialog between the
Cypriot National Guard and the Turkish forces in northern Cyprus.
</P>
<P>
Waldemar Rokozewski, spokesman of UN the Peace-Keeping Force in
Cyprus (UNFICYP) said today that after months of stalled
deliberations, certain progress has been made quite recently in
the talks between the two sides.
</P>
<P>
he said, "we are more optimistic. We believe that negotiations
may bring positive results on the entire package, proposed by the
U.N.".
</P>
<P>
UNFICYP is sponsoring separate talks with the National Guard
and the Turkish forces over a package of measures, which
include the extension of the 1989 unmanning agreement, the
prohibition of loaded weapons along the buffer zone and a code
of conduct for soldiers. The talks have been dragging on for
months.
</P>
<P>
Last month, the U.N. decided to step up its contacts from
once to twice a week in an effort to achieve some progress
after both community leaders gave their support to the dialog.
</P>
<P>
Rokozewski said UNFICYP welcomed the progress and would like
to conclude with the entire package as soon as possible.
</P>
<P>
He added that since all the elements are well known to
the parties concerned, "we believe that we can do it very
fast. Recent negotiations which we had with both sides showed
an opportunity for an agreement to be concluded."
</P>
<P>
The indirect talks between the Greek Cypriot National Guard
and Turkish forces, under the U.N. auspices, was conducted
following a tension along the 180-kilometers demarcation line,
which partitions this east Mediterranean island into two parts.
</P>
<P>
Since last June, four unarmed Greek Cypriots have been
killed and a Turkish soldier was mysteriously murdered along the
buffer zone.
</P>
<P>
Cyprus has been divided since 1974 when Turkish troops
occupied the northern third of the island in the wake of a
short-lived military coup seeking union with Greece.

WASHINGTON, February 21 (Xinhua) -- U.S. space shuttle
Discovery returned home early this morning after astronauts
successfully ended their 10-day Hubble Space telescope service
mission.
</P>
<P>
Discovery touched down on the runway of Kennedy Space Center,
Florida, at 3:32 a.m. EST under an almost full moon after passing
the first landing chance one and a half hours earlier because of
scattered clouds. The landing before dawn this morning is only the
ninth in darkness in total 82 space shuttle flights.
</P>
<P>
During their 10-day space voyage, the astronauts equipped the
Hubble telescope through four spacewalks with a new powerful
infrared camera and an advanced spectrograph as well as new
electronics, data recorders and some mechanical components. They
also repaired peeling thermal insulation on the telescope in the
unplanned fifth spacewalk.
</P>
<P>
The $795 million mission was the second of at least four service
calls planned for Hubble, which is near halfway through its 15-year
voyage. Hubble will be equipped with a more advanced camera during

<HEADLINE> Conference on Reporting China to Outside World (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, February 21 (Xinhua) -- The main task of reporting
China to the outside world in 1997 is to bring a better
understanding of the country to others, according to a leading
press official.
</P>
<P>
Zeng Jianhui, Director of the International Communication
Office of the Chinese Communist Party (CPC) Central Committee,
made the remark at a national conference on reporting China to the
outside world, which was held in Beijing from February 17-21.
</P>
<P>
Zeng, also Director of the Information Office of the State
Council, said the upcoming Party congress is of great historic
importance and the international community pays close attention to
it.
</P>
<P>
The reporting of China to the outside world should fully
reflect the historic achievement of the country's reform and
opening-up under the leadership of the CPC, he said.
</P>
<P>
Such reports should also make clear that as long as China
sticks to the socialist road while retaining its unique Chinese
characteristics, the country will continue to make notable
progress in social development and have an even more promising
future.
</P>
<P>
A stable political situation, consistent policies and a stable
society can only help prove that the CPC is capable of getting
China's overall situation under control, which will win the
support of the people of all ethnic groups, Zeng said.
</P>
<P>
The just-ended conference focused on the further research of
economic development, the convening of the 15th National Congress
of the CPC, and the resumption of the exercise of sovereignty over
Hong Kong in mid-1997.
</P>
<P>
The meeting also discussed how to strengthen reportage,
increase the understanding of China by people outside the country,
improve China's international image and create a sound
international press environment for China's reforms and the

<HEADLINE> Chinese, Kazak Presidents Meet in Beijing </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, February 21 (Xinhua) -- Chinese President Jiang Zemin
met here this afternoon with Kazakhstan's President Abishevich
Nazarbayev, who is vacationing in China.
</P>
<P>
On behalf of the Kazak government and people, Nazarbayev
expressed his profound sympathies over the death of Deng Xiaoping.
</P>
<P>
He said that Deng, as the chief architect of China's reform and
opening up, witnessed the realization of his great blueprint
design, and the best way to commemorate Deng is to carry forward
his cause of reform and opening up to the outside world.
</P>
<P>
Expressing his heartfelt appreciation, Jiang said that Deng was
an outstanding leader who held a highly prestigious position in
the eyes of the Party, the army and the people of all ethnic
groups throughout China.
</P>
<P>
Jiang said that Deng was also a great Marxist, proletarian
revolutionary, statesman, military strategist and diplomat, as
well as a long-tested Communist soldier, the chief architect of
China's socialist reform, opening up and modernization drive, and
the father of the theory of building socialism with Chinese
characteristics.
</P>
<P>
The death of Deng is an immeasurable loss for the Party, the
army and the people of all ethnic groups across China, he said.
</P>
<P>
The CPC, the Chinese army and people of various ethnic groups
are determined to turn grief into strength, hold high the great
banner of Deng's theory to build socialism with Chinese
characteristics, unite and continue the great cause of socialist
reforms and opening up and modernization drive unswervingly and
confidently, Jiang said, adding that "we would run China's
undertakings still better, and make greater contributions to the
cause of peace, development and progress of the mankind."
</P>
<P>
During the meeting, Jiang said that in the five years of
bilateral diplomatic ties, Sino-Kazak relations in various fields
have developed rapidly and still have great potential for
development, and the frequent exchanges of visits between leaders
of the two sides have enhanced mutual friendship and understanding.
</P>
<P>
He noted that to develop long-term and stable friendship and
cooperation with Kazakhstan is an important component of China's
policy on developing good-neighborly friendship.
</P>
<P>
"We are ready to strengthen cooperation with Kazakhstan in
various fields, in a bid to build a partnership of overall
cooperation, oriented to the next century, between China and
Kazakhstan," Jiang said.
</P>
<P>
Nazarbayev said that Jiang's visit to Kazakhstan last year was
"historic," and laid a foundation for bilateral friendship and
cooperation. The Kazak government supports China's foreign policy
and opposes any action of national separatism, he added.
</P>
<P>
He noted that there is vast potential for bilateral economic
cooperation, and the two sides can further strengthen cooperation
in the fields of communications, energy and trade.

<P>
China will resume the exercise of sovereignty over Hong Kong
this year, Zeng said, adding that the event, which has been
attracting worldwide attention, is an important step in the
country's reunification efforts, and will symbolize the erasure of
the nation's humiliation over the past century.
</P>
<P>
He urged those reporting on China to place more importance upon
reporting the Basic Law of the Hong Kong Special Administrative
Region, as well as Deng Xiaoping's theory and practice of "one
country, two systems."
</P>
<P>
Hong Kong's return should offer a good opportunity for
reporting that will illustrate the Chinese nation's spirit to
fight against overseas aggression in the past century, and the
Chinese people's glorious history of winning independence under
the leadship of the Communist Party of China (CPC), Zeng said.
</P>
<P>
He said the coverage of the ceremony for Hong Kong's return and
other celebrations in that period should be well organized.
</P>
<P>
Economic reports will continue to dominate the work of
reporting China to the outside world, Zeng noted, adding that
reports about China's economic conditions, economic policies and
those answering overseas readers' questions should be complete,
accurate and done promptly.
</P>
<P>
When news of Deng's death was learned during the conference,
participants expressed their deep sadness, vowing to follow
closely Deng's theory of building socialism with Chinese
characteristics, and to do a better job of carrying out
international communication under the leadership of CPC Central
Committee with the President Jiang Zemin at the core.

<HEADLINE> Turkish President Calls for Energy Development </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ANKARA, February 21 (Xinhua) -- Turkish President Suleyman
Demirel has called for more efforts in the energy production
in a bid to increase Turkey's competitive capacity on the
world market, local newspaper Daily News reported today.
</P>
<P>
Addressing a meeting here attended by businessmen Thursday,
Demirel said that Turkey needed an investment of 3.5 billion
U.S. dollars to meet the demands for energy as a result of
its rapidly expanding economy.
</P>
<P>
Conceding the energy shortages of his country, Demirel warned
the business circles that Turkey had to double its energy
supply to the industry if it wanted a competitive position in
the future.
</P>
<P>
He called the need for increased energy production as a
"national cause" and urged people of the country to remain united to
enhance investments in the energy sector.
</P>
<P>
A stable supply of energy will create positive conditions
for the continued increase of national income, Demirel said.
</P>
<P>
The government has reportedly worked out initial plans for
the construction of new nuclear power plants in order to
acquire reliable and cheap supply of electricity.
</P>
<P>
However, the program has drawn opposition from some
environmental organizations for fears of nuclear pollution.
</P>
<P>
Turkey has long suffered a shortage of energy and has to
import energy from neighboring countries such as Russia, Bulgaria,
Georgia and Iran to meet its domestic demands.

<HEADLINE> Indian Parliament Condole Deng Xiaoping's Death </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW DELHI, February 21 (Xinhua) -- Both houses of Indian
Parliament today condoled the death of Chinese leader Deng
Xiaoping and reaffirmed India's desire to build friendly,
good-neighborly, constructive and cooperative relations with China
for the prosperity of the people of the two countries.
</P>
<P>
Members of Parliament observed a minute of silence as a mark of
respect to the departed soul, Press Trust of India said.
</P>
<P>
Paying homage to Deng in the Rajya Sabha (the upper house of
parliament), Chairman K.R. Narayanan, who is also vice president
of India, recalled Deng's substantial contribution in recent years
to India-China relations and said it was his historic meeting with
the then prime minister Rajiv Gandhi during his visit to China in
1988 which "reoriented our bilateral relations."
</P>
<P>
Narayanan said Rajiv Gandhi during his visit had recalled the
importance of cooperation between India and China, the need for
the two countries to develop economically and for the
establishment of a new international political order based on the
Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence.
</P>
<P>
In the Lok Sabha (the lower house), Speaker P.A. Sangma said
that Deng was a great leader of the Chinese people whose
contribution to the modernization of China would be ever
remembered.
</P>
<P>
Under his leadership, China launched the process of economic
reform and opening to the outside world which, Sangma said, had
been responsible for raising the standard of living of the Chinese
people and the integration of Chinese economy with that of the
world.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Mideast Role Supportive With Israelis, </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, February 21 (Xinhua) -- The United States plays a
"supportive role with the Israelis" in the Mideast peace
negotiations, U.S. Ambassador to Egypt Edward Walker said.
</P>
<P>
This could be the first time that the U.S. side, a key mediator
in the peace process, concedes that it stands by Israel in the
process, observers here noted.
</P>
<P>
Walker made the remarks during an interview published in the
latest issue of local English language Al-Ahram Weekly that
focused mainly on the agenda of Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak's
visit to Washington, due to begin on March 10.
</P>
<P>
When speaking of the Egyptian and U.S. roles in the peace
process, Walker told the Weekly, "We would make a mistake to
think (the roles of the two countries were identical), and we
would not be very effective, if we had identical roles."
</P>
<P>
Since the signing of the Camp David peace agreement in 1978,
it had become clear that Egypt "has an obligation and a role to
play with the Palestinians, that is supportive role, one which is
designed to help them to reach an agreement," he continued.
</P>
<P>
The U.S., on the other hand, plays a "supportive role with
the Israelis," also to help them to arrive at an accord, the
U.S. diplomat asserted.
</P>
<P>
Therefore, he added, "there is a slightly different cast on
each and we believe that both of us, acting together can help
mediate the problems between the two sides and encourage the two
sides, and I think that's what happened....It's important to
maintain the dialog."
</P>
<P>
Talking about Mubarak's coming trip to Washington, Walker said
that the timing of the tour is "good," the aim of which is to talk
on "very difficult areas" of the Palestinian track of the peace
process, according to the ambassador.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. ambassador said that the Egyptian-U.S. economic
partnership will also be on the agenda of Mubarak's trip with his
counterpart Bill Clinton.

<TEXT>
<P>
A scientific judgement made by Deng and the CPC about
contemporary China's basic national conditions is that China is at
the initial stage of socialism.
</P>
<P>
After the Third Plenary Session of the Eleventh Party Central
Committee, Deng pointed out that with such a poor foundation to
start, a huge population, and limited farmland, China must take a
modernization road of its own style.
</P>
<P>
In speaking about the experiences of China's socialist
construction in 1980, Deng said, "Don't use 'leftist' measures
which are divorced from reality and overstep the present-day
period of development. Such measures can not help build socialism."
</P>
<P>
On the eve of the 13th National Party Congress, Deng pointed
out, "The 13th National Party Congress must make it clear that
China's socialism is at its initial stage. Socialism itself is the
initial stage of Communism. Since China is at the initial stage of
socialism, it is at a state of underdevelopment. We must proceed
in all cases from this reality and work out our plans based on the
reality."
</P>
<P>
The 13th Congress of the CPC systematically expounded the
theory on the initial stage of socialism, and gave a brief summary
to Deng's explanations of socialism's initial stage: "Lead and
unite people of all ethnic groups of the whole country, focus on
economic construction, stick to the four cardinal principles,
stick to reforms and opening to the outside world, self-reliance
and hard work, in an effort to build China into a rich, powerful,
democratic socialist country with modernization and civilization."

<P>
In a speech entitled "the current situation and tasks" in 1980,
Deng pointed out that there were three key tasks for the 1980s,
but the most important one was modernization. Deng urged the whole
Party to devote its efforts to this task and never let up. All
other tasks must serve the central task of economic construction.
</P>
<P>
In the development of productivity, Deng paid special attention
to the position and role of science and technology and proposed a
new idea that science and technology are the most important part
in productivity.
</P>
<P>
Believing that the key to China's modernization is the
modernization of its science and technology, He called for respect
of knowledge and talents. He emphasized that the basis of bringing
up scientific and technological talents is education. Education is
of equal importance to science and technology, and is the most
fundamental cause of a nation.
</P>
<P>
With great foresight, Deng outlined a strategy of economic
development for China. In 1979, he put forward the goal of
quadrupling the country's GNP by the end of the century and giving
most Chinese a relatively comfortable standard of living.
</P>
<P>
In his speeches over the next few years, Deng drew a three-step
blueprint for the country's development from the 1980s up to the
middle of the 21st century: The first step would double the GNP
between 1981 and 1990; the second would double the GNP a second
time and give people a relatively well-off life by the end of the
century; and the third would bring the GNP to the middle-level of
developed countries and give people a much better life and would
basically realize modernization. This development strategy was
approved at the 13th National Congress of the Chinese Communist
Party.

Kuwait News Agency reported today.
</P>
<P>
The report said the three foreign firms take 16.33 percent of
the stakes in the joint venture each.
</P>
<P>
Company sources were quoted as saying the building for the

In targeting the old sytem that was handicapping productivity,
Deng proposed that reform is the only way for China to develop
productivity, noting that reform was significant to the liberation
of productivity. "Reform is China's second revolution," he
commented.
</P>
<P>
Deng gave his full support to rural reforms that started by
fixing farm quotas for each household. Summerizing the experiences
of rural reforms, he shifted the reforms to urban areas.
</P>
<P>
The Third Plenary Session of the 12th Central Committee made a
decision on restructuring the economy in 1984 that involved
reforms on the economic, political, scientific, technological and
educational sectors in China. Deng spoke highly of the decision.
</P>
<P>
Facing this unprecedented and complicated experiment, Deng put
forward a guiding principle of great courage and cautious
steps. He said, "We must stick to two principles consistently. One
is socialist public ownership forming the mainstay of the economy
and the other is common prosperity."
</P>
<P>
He broke with the traditional concepts and tied the market
economy to socialism. In many of his speeches from 1979 to 1992,
Deng pointed out that socialism should also have a market
economy. Both planning and market are the means, he said, but not
the intrinsic difference between socialism and capitalism. These
speeches laid a theoretical foundation for the Party to set the
reform targets for a socialist market economic structure.
</P>
<P>
In 1980, Deng made an important speech entitled "Reform of the
Party and the State leadership structure" at an enlarged meeting
of the Party's Political Bureau. His speech targeted the
fundamental and long-term problems of leadership and organization
structure and gave a summary of experiences and lessons of the
"Cultural Revolution".
</P>
<P>
Deng called for a reform of the bad practices in the existing
leadership structure. He noted in 1986 that without reforming the
political system, the economic reform would be hampered and the
development of productivity checked. He made it clear that the
goal of the reform of the political structure was maintaining the
vitality of the Party and the State and making leading officials
at all levels younger, getting rid of the bureaucracy, increasing
work efficiency, and mobilizing the enthusiasm of the grass roots
and the people.
</P>
<P>
Deng stressed that China must work hard to develop socialist
democracy, strengthen the socialist legal system, and build
socialist democracy in the process of socialist modernization.

<HEADLINE> Australian PM Attacks Racism </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, February 21 (Xinhua) -- Australian Prime Minister
John Howard strongly attacked the manifestations of racism while
addressing a party in Chinatown in Sydney tonight.
</P>
<P>
Attending the annual Chinese new year dinner, the prime
minister praised the Chinese community for its entrepreneurs and
contribution to the Australian economy.
</P>
<P>
"Of course," he said, "there are some within our ranks who
harbor prejudice and bigotry and who do display intolerance,
whether it is on ethnic or racial grounds or other grounds. And I
want to say, that is not part of the true Australian spirit."
</P>
<P>
"Any manifestation of racism in our ranks is repugnant to
everything for which Australia has always stood."
</P>
<P>
Howard's comments were directed against last year's racial
debate sparked by Queensland MP Pauline Hanson who said Asians
formed ghettoes and Australia was in danger of becoming swamped by
migrants.
</P>
<P>
Referring to Australia's relations with China, Howard said he
would travel to China "with a determination to further build a
pragmatic, common-sense relationship built on mutual respect and
on a recognition of the importance of welcoming China into the
family of nations, into the Asia Pacific region. It's on that
basis that I will visit Beijing and Shanghai during Easter of this
year."

<HEADLINE> Nigeria to Forfeit W. Bank Education Loan </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, February 21 (Xinhua) -- Nigeria is to forfeit a
100-million-US-Dollar World Bank loan to its primary education
for poor project performances, the Guardian paper reported today.
</P>
<P>
The report said because of the poor showing of local
authorities in implementing the project, the talk on another
80-million-Dollar loan to secondary education which started in
1995 is also jeopardized.
</P>
<P>
It quoted authoritative sources at the World Bank mission in
Nigeria as saying that the bank has already notified the Nigerian
Finance Ministry of its resolve to cancel 100 million Dollars of
the 120 million Dollars granted in 1991.
</P>
<P>
It said Nigeria's National Primary Education Commission (NPEC)
has applied through the finance ministry for the extending of the
project for another three years, as the original project is
expected to terminate in June this year.
</P>
<P>
But a World Bank official reportedly said on Thursday, "the
chances are very slim that we will extend the loan duration."
</P>
<P>
The report blamed the impending cancellation of the project to
the massive fraud uncovered within NPEC, which has been
responsible for the implementation of the project.
</P>
<P>
"If such magnitude of fraud existed at NPEC which the World
Bank thinks is the only organ that could creditably implement the
World Bank project, which agency then can the bank entrust with
the duty," a source said.

<HEADLINE> Deng Xiaoping's Great, Brilliant Life (21) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Deng Xiaoping took opening up to the outside world as one of
the country's fundamental policies and pointed out that it is
impossible for any country to develop by adopting a policy of
isolation and seclusion. The world is indispensable to China's
development.
</P>
<P>
China must absorb all the achievements of human civilization,
he said, and it should be open to all countries in the world in a
comprehensive way, and actively develop foreign trade, expand
Sino-foreign cooperation and introduce foreign capital, advanced
technology, and managerial experiences.
</P>
<P>
Moreover, he said, China must introduce foreign intelligence
and send a large number of students to study abroad.
</P>
<P>
Deng also made a series of important policy decisions on
establishing special economic zones, opening up a dozen of coastal
port cities, opening a coastal economic development belt, and
developing Shanghai's Pudong New Area. He made inspection tours of
the country's special economic zones in 1984 and 1992, and noted
that the special economic zones serve as the country's showcase of
technology, management, expertise, and foreign policy, with their
fast growth spurring the nationwide opening-up, which has
stimulated the country's reform and modernization drive.
</P>
<P>
However, the push for reform, opening-up and socialist
modernization would not be smooth sailing Instead, it would
inevitably encounter obstacles. In the political disturbances
during the turn of Spring and Summer in 1989, Deng and other
revolutionary veterans firmly supported the resolute measures
taken by the Party and Government, which succeeded in safeguarding
national independence, dignity, security and stability.
</P>
<P>
Deng stressed in particular that reforms and economic
construction require a stable political environment, and that
stability overrides everything else. Also, he pointed out that the
Party's policies and principles drawn up since the Third Plenary
Session of the 11th Party Central Committee are all correct and
the occurrence of the event could in no way prove the set
strategic goals to be wrong. Neither adherence to the Four
Cardinal Principles nor reform and opening-up is mistaken. The
only mistake lied in inconsistent adherence to the Four Cardinal
Principles, poor work in political and ideological education, or a
situation with "one hand strong, and the other weak."
</P>
<P>
He emphasized that efforts must be made to adhere to the set
basic lines, policies and principles which will remain unchanged.
</P>
<P>
Deng paid great attention to socialist cultural and ideological
construction, stressing the importance of building advanced
socialist culture, ethics, and ideology, while working hard for an
advanced socialist material civilization. Only when both aspects
of the progress are achieved can it be called socialism with
Chinese characteristics, he said, pointing constantly to the need
to push for material advancement on one hand, and cultural and
ethical progress on the other, with both hands working hard all
the time. The whole people should be so educated that they have
lofty ideals, moral principles, knowledge and expertise together
with disciplines, he said, noting that efforts should be made to
make full use of China's advantages and unite the people with a
firm faith.
</P>
<P>
Addressing the National Congress of the CPC back in 1985, Deng
cautioned the Party that it would follow a crooked path and
material civilization would be hurt, if cultural and ethical
development was not sufficiently strengthened, and that revolution
and construction would not possibly succeed by depending on
material conditions alone.
</P>
<P>
Later, he added that efforts should never be loosened for a
single day to push for cultural, ethical and ideological
advancement and to build up a fine Party style and social
atmosphere. Rather, work in this regard need to be handled case by
case.

As supreme leader of the PLA, Deng put forth many important
ideas on building the army in the new phase of China's
development, providing scientific judgements on modern times and
China's security environment, and ensuring a strategic shift in
the guiding ideology for building the army and national defense.
</P>
<P>
Deng demanded that the armed forces built into a powerful,
modernized and standardized revolutionary army, working for the
modernization drive as its central task, walking along a path of
developing the best troops with Chinese characteristics, and
boosting defense capabilities to guarantee national security and
safeguard the unity of the motherland.
</P>
<P>
Deng noted that the army should obey, serve, support and
participate in the country's economic construction, acting
conscientiously in this overall interest of the country.
</P>
<P>
Under his leadership, the PLA troops were cut by one million,
in a practical move of China in safeguarding world peace. In 1989,
when resigning his post as chairman of the Central Military
Commission, Deng expressed the deep conviction that the PLA will
unswerving stick to its nature, that is, an army of the Party, of
the people and of the socialist country.
</P>
<P>
To order to solve the problem of Hong Kong, Macao, and Taiwan
and to achieve the reunification of the motherland, Deng, by
respecting both history and realities, and by proceeding from the
actual conditions, creatively put forth the idea of "one country,
two systems", which means practising socialism on the Chinese
mainland and allowing the existence of a capitalist system in Hong
Kong, Macao and Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
In September 1982, in meeting with the British prime minister,
Deng expounded on China's basic stand on the Hong Kong issue and
defended the sovereignty and dignity of the motherland. Deng threw
his energy into the whole process of solving the problem of Hong
Kong and Macao.
</P>
<P>
On July 1, 1997, China will resume its exercise of sovereignty
over Hong Kong, thus accomplishing his great plan.
</P>
<P>
In 1983, he brought up the eight-point principle for settling
the Taiwan problem, expressing a strong wish to reunify the
motherland. In view of attempts to split China, Deng emphasized
that it won't do to give up the use of non-peaceful means to solve
the Taiwan issue. The idea of "one country, two systems"
constitutes not only an important part of the theory of building
socialism with Chinese characteristics, but also serves as a model
for resolving similar problems elsewhere in the world.
</P>
<P>
Socialist modernization requires not only domestic stability,
but a peaceful international environment as well. Deng put forth a
full set of diplomatic strategies, sizing up the situation of the
whole world.
</P>
<P>
He defined peace and development as the two major issues of the
present world, saying China must adhere to an independent foreign
policy of peace, oppose hegemonism, and safeguard world peace. He
stood for the establishment of a new international political and
economic order with the Five Principles of Peaceful Co-existence
as the norms.
</P>
<P>
He stressed that China will always belong to the Third World,
and never seek hegemony. With Deng in charge, China established
diplomatic relations with the United States, signed the
Sino-Japanese peace and friendship treaty, restored relations
between the two parties and countries of China and the Soviet
Union, and developed friendly relations with neighboring countries
and many Third World nations.
</P>
<P>
He visited many countries and played host to the leaders of
many countries. Amidst a changing international situation towards
the end of the 1980s and at the beginning of the 1990s, when the
socialist cause underwent serious setbacks, Deng put forth a
strategy of studying the situation with a sober mind, holding
tight to our ground, and dealing with the challenges with calm,
stressing the need to always put national sovereignty and security
in the first place.
</P>
<P>
Deng Xiaoping contributed tremendously to ensure favorable
international conditions for China's modernization drive, and to
the cause of safeguarding world peace and the progress of all
mankind.

Deng Xiaoping always attached importance to Party building. He
held that the core of the Four Cardinal Principles is to stick to
the Party leadership, which is the key to realization of the
four-modernization program.
</P>
<P>
He suggested that to adhere to and strengthen the Party
leadership, efforts should be made to improve the Party
leadership, status of its work and organization, and system of
leadership.
</P>
<P>
Deng said that efforts should be focused on the Party building,
in order to build the Party into a staunch core to lead the people
throughout the country in promoting material civilization and
socialist cultural and ethical progress.
</P>
<P>
Great heed should be paid to studying Marxist theory, and the
sense of principle, systematization, foresight, and creativeness
should be enhanced.
</P>
<P>
He said that the democratic centralism should be adhered to and
further improved and the central authority should be maintained.
</P>
<P>
He emphasized that the key to rectifying social atmosphere
hinges on improvement of Party style. It's essential to carry
forward the style of hard work and forging close ties with the
masses. In the entire process of reforms and opening up to the
outside world, corruption should be resolutely opposed. And
building a clean and honest government should be taken as a major
task.
</P>
<P>
In view of the future of the Party and the nation, Deng firmly
stood for eradicating the life tenure of leading officials and he
personally took the lead in doing so.
</P>
<P>
He himself had asked time and again for retirement from leading
posts. He no longer participated in the CPC Central Committee and
Central Advisory Commission at the 13th National Congress of the
CPC in November 1987.
</P>
<P>
At the Fifth Plenum of the 13th CPC Central Committee in
November, 1989, Deng again resigned from his post as chairman of the
Central Military Commission, realizing his long-cherished wish of
resigning from all his posts.
</P>
<P>
He played a crucial role in promoting a smooth transition from
the second generation of leadership with himself at the core to the
third generation with Jiang Zemin at the core and safeguarding the
stability of the Party and the country.
</P>
<P>
Noting that the core of the first generation of Party
leadership was Chairman Mao, and that he could be taken as the
head of the second generation, he said the third generation must
also have a core; that is Comrade Jiang Zemin, and everybody
should safeguard this collective leadership and its core. "This
is my political accountability," he said.
</P>
<P>
Although he quit his leading posts, Deng followed with concern
the reforms, opening-up, and modernization drive with a tremendous
sense of historical responsibility.

In early 1992, Deng made an inspection tour of Wuchang,
Shenzhen, Zhuhai, Shanghai and other southern places, and made
important remarks, summerizing the Party's basic practices and
experience since the Third Plenum of the 11th CPC Central
Committee held in late 1978, and answered a number of major
questions that had puzzled and confined people's thinking
frequently.
</P>
<P>
He noted that the nature of socialism is the liberation of
productive forces, developing productivity, eradicating
exploitation and eliminating polarization, and eventually
achieving common prosperity.
</P>
<P>
The criterion to tell the right from the wong in various fields
of work, he said, should be taken into account whether it is
favorable for the development of productive forces in socialist
society, whether it is favorable for strengthening the
comprehensive national strength, and whether it is favorable for
the improvement of people's standard of living."
</P>
<P>
He stressed that bolder efforts should be made in reform and
opening up to the outside world and opportune time should be
seized to develop China itself and the crux is economic
development.
</P>
<P>
He said the Party's basic political line should be kept to
unswervingly for 100 years.
</P>
<P>
His talks provide ample theoretical preparations for the
convening of the Party's 14th National Congress, held in October,
1992, which advocated that Deng Xiaoping's theory of building
socialism with Chinese characteristics must be used to arm the
whole party and designated the establishment of the socialist
market economy as the goal of reform.
</P>
<P>
China's reforms, opening-up, and modernization drive entered a
new phase, epitomized by Deng's talks in the south and the Party's
14th National Congress.
</P>
<P>
In 1993, 89-year-old Deng was personally in charge of compiling
the third volume of the Selected Works of Deng Xiaoping and
finalized each of is articles. The second and third volumes
collected his major creative works in the cause of shaping and
developing his theory of building socialism with Chinese
characteristics. They are scientific guidelines for China's
socialist reforms, opening-up and modernization drive.
</P>
<P>
The theory of building socialism with Chinese characteristics
created by Deng Xiaoping is the product of combining the basic
principles of Maxism and Leninism with the reality of contemporary
China and the features of the times, representing the inheritance
and development of Mao Zedong thought and Marxism of contemporary
China. It has become the most precious ideological assets of the
Chinese Communist Party and the entire Chinese people, and serves
as the spiritual prop in the invigoration and development of the
Chinese nation.
</P>
<P>
Guided by this theory, the Chinese people are successfully
marching towards the 21st century under the leadership of the CPC
Central Committee with Jiang Zemin at the core.

HONG KONG, February 21 (Xinhua) -- The Year of Heritage, the
first year-round event dedicated to the promotion of local
heritage preservation, was kicked off today in Hong Kong, whose
6,000 years of civilization seem to be eclipsed by her status as
an industrial and financial hub.
</P>
<P>
Organized by the Antiquities Advisory Board (AAB), the Lord
Wilson Heritage Trust and the Antiquities and Monuments Office,
the Year of Heritage program will present exhibitions, tours,
lectures, archaeological workshops and international conference on
heritage education, among other events.
</P>
<P>
AAB Chairman David Lung Ping-yee expected that the program
would "arouse public awareness and concern of local heritage
preservation and help the younger generation increase their
understanding of and love for the rich cultural heritage that we
own."
</P>
<P>
With Hong Kong's return to China in mid-1997, HK has become the
focus of global media, and the Year of Heritage provides a golden
opportunity to publicize Hong Kong's heritage, he said.
</P>
<P>
Archaeological studies in Hong Kong have uncovered evidence of
ancient human activities, dating back to over 6,000 years ago, at
many sites along the winding shoreline.
</P>
<P>
Chief Secretary Anson Chan officiated at the opening ceremony
at Charter Garden, Central.
</P>
<P>
If the heritage disappeared one day from the territory, Hong
Kong would be a rootless city whatever progress was achieved (in
other fields), she noted.
</P>
<P>
Prizes were awarded to the winners and merits of the logo
design competition for the Year of Heritage.

LAGOS, February 21 (Xinhua) -- Head of State General Sani
Abacha has restated Nigeria's commitment to the peaceful
resolution of the Bakassi dispute, the Daily Times paper reported
today.
</P>
<P>
a peaceful resolution of the dispute would advance the cause
of peace, stability, solidarity and progress of the entire
continent, he said on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Abacha reportedly made the comment in Abuja while receiving

Guinean President Lansana Conte.

President Conte has been mandated by the United Nations to
intervene in the conflict between Nigerian and Cameroun over the
oil-rich Bakassi peninsula in the Gulf of Guinea. The two
countries have gone into clashes for several times in the few

</P>
<P>
The Nigerian Head of State is of the view that the persistence
and escalation of the crisis would not serve any useful purpose,
and that the earlier the conflict is resolved, the better for all
parties concerned, the newspaper said.
</P>
<P>
Abacha also expressed confidence in the ability, sincerity and
experience of President Conte in meeting the U.N. mission, it

<P>
The Third Plenary Session of the Eleventh Central Committee of
the CPC in December of 1978 marked a great turning-point in the
history of the Party and the country and ushered in a new era of
development of the socialist cause.
</P>
<P>
In his speech entitled "Emancipate mind, seek truth from facts,
and unite as one to look forward" at a working conference of the
Party Central Committee held before the plenary session, Deng
noted that, "Emancipation of the mind is an important political
issue at the moment.
</P>
<P>
"If a party, a country or a nation proceeds in all cases like a
bookworshiper, with ossified thought, and practises superstition
enthusiastically, it will not make any progress, its life will
come to an end and the Party and the country will perish.
</P>
<P>
"Democracy is an important condition for the emancipation of
mind," he said, and "We must institutionalize and legalize
democracy.", "We must study new situations and solve new
problems." He emphasized, "If we do not start the reforms right
now, our cause of modernization and the cause of socialism will be
ruined."
</P>
<P>
Deng also initiated the policy of allowing certain areas and
certain people to become wealthier first, so that they in turn
would help other areas and other people to get rich. As a result,
the whole national economy would develop and bring the people of
all ethnic groups to a better life at a relatively fast pace.
</P>
<P>
This policy was of great importance, and the speech served as
the key-note speech for the plenary session.
</P>
<P>
The session reestablished the thinking mode of emancipating
mind and seeking truth from facts, and firmly put an end to the
use of the erroneous slogan "Take class struggle as the key link."

<P>
The Third Plenary Session shifted the Party and State's work
priority to the construction of socialist modernization and put
forward the strategic policy of reform and opening to the outside
world.
</P>
<P>
The second collective leadership with Deng Xiaoping at the core
came into being after this plenary session.
</P>
<P>
Deng paid close attention to dealing with the matter of the
Party's organizational line. In many of his speeches, Deng
emphasized that the materialization of ideological and political
lines should be guaranteed by the organizational line. He adopted
a series of measures to make cadres more revolutionary, younger,
more knowledgeable and more professional. And he abolished the
system of lifetime tenure of leading cadres and set up a new
system of cooperation and succession for older and younger cadres.
</P>
<P>
A rightist trend of getting rid of the Party leadership and
opposing the socialist road began to emerge in the process of
setting things to right and correcting the "leftist" mistakes.
</P>
<P>
In an effort to maintain correct orientation in the
modernization drive, Deng gave a speech entitled "Sticking to the
Four Cardinal Principles" in March of 1979 at a theory meeting
convened by the CPC Central Committee.
</P>
<P>
Taking a clear-cut stand, Deng proposed that China stick to the
socialist road, stick to the people's democratic dictatorship,
stick to the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party, and stick
to Marxism, Leninism and Mao Zedong Thought. "These are the
prerequisites of realizing the four modernizations," he said, "If
any one of the four cardinal principles is shaken, it means the
shaking of the whole socialist cause and the whole cause of
modernization."

The Sixth Plenary Session of the Eleventh CCP Central Committee
in June of 1981 passed a resolution on a number of historical
issues after the founding of the People's Republic of China in
1949.
</P>
<P>
The resolution summarized past experience, refuted the
"Cultural Revolution", and gave a scientific assessment on Mao
Zedong Thought to secure Mao's historical status.
</P>
<P>
The subsequent domestic developments and changes in the
international situation served to demonstrate Deng's great courage
and vision in making this important decision. At the plenary
session, Deng was elected chairman of the Central Military
Commission.
</P>
<P>
The 12th National Congress of the CCP was held in September of
1982. At the opening session, Deng called on the Party to "combine
the universal truth of Marxism with the specific conditions of our
country, take our own road and build socialism with Chinese
characteristics." The Congress adopted a programme of creating a
new situation in the socialist modernization.
</P>
<P>
Deng was elected a member of the Standing Committee of the CPC
Central Committee's Political Bureau and appointed chairman of the
Central Military Commission, at the First Session of the Twelfth
Central Committee. A Central Advisory Commission was set up at the
Congress and Deng was elected chairman of the commission at its
first plenary session.
</P>
<P>
In the years following the Third Plenary Session of the
Eleventh Central Committee, Deng focused on the meaning of
socialism and how to build socialism, and for the first time gave
a systematic, tentative answer to such basic questions as to how
to build, consolidate and develop socialism in such an
economically and culturally backward country like China. Deng
developed Marxism, Leninism and Mao Zedong Thought with new
thoughts and new ideas.

used for the 1998 World Cup soccer finals.
</P>
<P>
Interior minister Jean-Louis Debre told the sports daily
l'Equipe on Friday he could not take the risk of pulling fences
down.
</P>
<P>
"I can only say that to assure the security in a competition of
this size there can be no question about taking fences down," he
said.
</P>
<P>
"With Guy Drut, the sports minister, we carried out a survey
and came to the conclusion it would not be possible to take fences
down. We aren't ready for it," he added.

<HEADLINE> HKSAR Provisional Legislature To Meet in Shenzhen </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, February 21 (Xinhua) -- The Provisional Legislative
Council (PLC) of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region
(HKSAR) will hold a meeting tomorrow in Shenzhen, the Chinese city
bordering Hong Kong.
</P>
<P>
During the meeting, the tentative legislature is to formally
set up two working groups to determine working rules and to study
the administrative framework of the PLC, said Rita Fan, the PLC
president. Lists of the 12 members for each ad hoc team, one on
administrative matters and the other on rules of procedures, will
be announced tomorrow.
</P>
<P>
The two working groups will then meet concurrently to elect
their convenors and formulate future work plans. Finally, the
convenors of each team will move respective resolutions to the PLC
for endorsement.
</P>
<P>
According to Rita Fan, before June 30, 1997, the PLC will hold
its plenary meeting in Shenzhen in order to respect the British
governing of Hong Kong. During the period, the interim body will
make preparations for the legislative work after July 1, 1997, so
that it will by no means affect the operation of the current
Legislative Council under the Hong Kong British government, said
the PLC president.
</P>
<P>
Founded on December 21, 1996, the PLC will continue to operate
until the first Legislative Council of the HKSAR is elected around
June 30, 1998.

<P>
The Huaihai Campaign began in November 1948. The CPC Central
Committee and the Central Commission decided that Liu Bocheng,
Chen Yi, Deng Xiaoping, Su Yu, and Tan Zhenlin form the General
Front Committee, with Deng acting as secretary, exercising unified
command over the Central China Plains Field Army (later the Second
Field Army) and the East China Field Army (later the Third Field
Army).
</P>
<P>
During the Huaihai Campaign, Chiang Kai-shek deployed nearly
800,000 troops, while the PLA soldiers numbered only 600,000. In
terms of weapon and equipment, the Kuomintang troops had an even
greater advantage.
</P>
<P>
The General Front Committee carried out the principle of
concentrating superior forces and wiping out the enemy one by one,
with the result that the PLA eliminated 555,000 enemy troops in 66
days of fighting, winning complete victory in the Huaihai Campaign.
</P>
<P>
In March 1949, Deng attended the Second Plenum of the Seventh
CPC Central Committee and according to an appointment, he also
served as first secretary of the East China Bureau. On April 21,
on the order to march nationwide issued by Chairman Mao Zedong and
Commander-In-Chief Zhu De, the General Front Committee, with Deng
as its secretary, led the second and third field armies to launch
the Nanjing-Shanghai-Hangzhou Campaign. The PLA troops broke
through the Yangtze River defense of the Kuomintang troops in one
stroke, triumphantly crossed the Yangtze River, and liberated
Nanjing, Shanghai, and large areas in Jiangsu, Anhui, Zhejiang,
and Jiangxi provinces. The liberation of Nanjing meant the
downfall of the Kuomintang's reactionary rule.
</P>
<P>
In September 1949, on the eve of the founding of the People's
Republic of China, Deng was elected a member of the Central
People's Government at the First Plenum of the Chinese People's
Political Consultative Conference.
</P>
<P>
In October, he served as a member of the Chinese People's
Revolutionary Military Commission. Later, he and Liu Bocheng led
troops toward the southwest, rapidly eliminating more than 900,000
Kuomintang reactionary troops entrenched in Yunnan, Guizhou, and
Sichuan provinces and driving the Kuomintang's reactionaries out
of the mainland.
</P>
<P>
In southwest China, Deng served as the first secretary of the
Southwest China Bureau of the CPC Central Committee, vice-chairman
of the Southwest China Military and Administrative Committee, and
political commissar of the Southwest China Military Command.
</P>
<P>
While commanding troops along with Liu Bocheng and He Long in
removing bandits and remaining enemy forces, Deng worked on
uniting all those who could be united and winning over all those
within the enemy camp who could be won over, thereby bringing all
positive factors into play, clearing up various ethnic
estrangements left over from history prudently and steadily, and
promoting unity among various ethnic groups.
</P>
<P>
Deng also mobilized and relied on people to accomplish the
tasks of land and other social reform, strengthening political
power at various levels, rapidly restoring industrial and
agricultural production and building the Chengdu-Chongqing
Railway, thereby promptly settling the chaotic situation there and
creating a new mood of stability and development in southwest
China. He also participated in leading troops to Tibet and
liberate it by peaceful means, thus realizing the complete
liberation of the mainland.

MAPUTO, February 21 (Xinhua) -- Mozambican President Joaquim
Chissano today went to Chinese Embassy in Maputo and mourned late
Chinese leader Deng Xiaoping who had passed away on Wednesday
night at the age of 93.
</P>
<P>
"I hereby express my deep sorrow over the passing away of Deng
Xiaoping who is not only an outstanding leader of the Chinese
Communist Party and the People's Republic of China, but also a
great friend of Mozambique," Chissano wrote in the embassy's
visitors' book.
</P>
<P>
The Mozambican president, accompanied by Prime Minister
Pascoal Mocumbi, Foreign Minister Leonardo Simao and other
top-ranking government officials, paid one minute's silent
tribute to Deng's portrait during the mourning.
</P>
<P>
"As China mourned the great leader nationwide, I, on behalf of
the people and government of Mozambique as well as myself, would
like to express profound condolences to Deng's family," Chissano
wrote.
</P>
<P>
He praised Deng as one of the recognized international
political leaders of the 20th century.
</P>

In July, 1952, Deng was transferred to Beijing and appointed
vice-premier of the Government Administration Council and deputy
director of the Financial and Economic Committee, as well as
director of the communications office of the Government
Administration Council and minister of Finance. He suggested that
the country's finance should be placed on a constant, stable and
reliable basis and should be guided by an all-sided concept.
</P>
<P>
In 1954, he served as secretary-general of the CPC Central
Committee, head of the Organization Department of the CPC Central
Committee, vice-premier of the State Council, and vice-chairman of
the National Defence Council. He made an important contribution in
the struggle against attempts to split the Party and usurp the
supreme power of the State and the Party by Gao Gang and Rao
Shushi.
</P>
<P>
In April, 1955, Deng was elected to the Political Bureau of the
CPC Central Committee at the 5th Plenary Session of the 7th CPC
Central Committee.
</P>
<P>
In September, 1956, in his report on revising the Party's
Constitution at the 8th CPC National Congress, he elaborated on
the ruling Party's task in strengthening itself, pointing out that
the the Party faces new challenges, and it is necessary to
constantly guard against being divorced from the masses and
losing contact with reality, and called on the Party to adhere to
the mass line and democratic centralism, enhance the collective
leadership of Party organizations at various levels and avoid
arbitrary individual act in making decisions on major issues.
</P>
<P>
Deng was elected member of the Standing Committee of the
Politburo and general-secretary of the CPC Central Committee at
the 1st Plenary Session of the 8th CPC Central Committee to become
an important member of the first-generation leadership of the
Communist Party of China with Mao Zedong at its core.
</P>
<P>
In recommending Deng for the post of the general secretary of
the CPC Central Committee, Mao said that he was an able,
thoughtful, fair, and honest man who took the views of all into
account. In 1959, he was again made member of the Standing
Committee of the Central Military Commission.

<HEADLINE> Portuguese President to Visit Beijing as Scheduled </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MACAO, February 21 (Xinhua) -- Portuguese President Jorge
Sampaio will start his visit to China from February 23 as
scheduled although part of his visit itineraries may be slightly
adjusted, said a top Chinese official here today.
</P>
<P>
Wang Qiren, director of the Xinhua News Agency Macao Branch,
told reporters after a meeting with the Portuguese president for
one hour twenty minutes that the president's visit to China will
start as scheduled although the Chinese people are all in deep
sorrow over Deng Xiaoping's pass-away.
</P>
<P>
"The Chinese government welcomes the scheduled visit of
Portuguese President Jorge Sampaio from February 23, although its
1.2 billion people are in deep grief over the loss of a great
leader," said Wang. "Some itineraries may be slightly adjusted,
but the substantive talks between leaders of the two countries
will be held as planned."
</P>
<P>
Sampaio canceled his planned visit on Thursday here and made an
announcement of condolence over Deng's pass-away. He also paid his
last respect to the late Chinese leader at a mourning hall in the
Xinhua News Agency Macao Branch.
</P>
<P>
During the meeting with Wang today, the president again
expressed his grief over the death of an outstanding Chinese
leader. Wang thanked him on behalf of the Chinese government.
</P>
<P>
"(The president's move) not only shows the president's respect
to a great man of the century, it also demonstrates that the
president highly values the friendship between China and
Portugal," said the director.
</P>
<P>
It is the first time Sampaio visited Macao after he took office
as Portuguese president in March last year.
</P>
<P>
He is expected to discuss a wide range of issues concerning the
transition of Macao and Sino-Portuguese political, economic and
trade relations with Chinese leaders during his forthcoming visit
to Beijing.
</P>
<P>
China and Portugal have maintained good relations following the
establishment of diplomatic relations in 1979. Under the
Sino-Portuguese Joint Declaration on the Question of Macao signed
in 1987, China will resume its exercise of sovereignty over Macao
as of December 20, 1999.
</P>
<P>
Macao will enjoy a high degree of autonomy after 1999. The
current life style and its capitalist system will remain unchanged
for 50 years, according to the joint declaration.

<HEADLINE> Kuwait's Revenues Increase by Nearly One-Fifth, </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUWAIT CITY, February 21 (Xinhua) -- Kuwaiti actual revenues
for the fiscal year of 1995-96 ending June 30 stood at 11.5
billion U.S. dollars, an increase of 19.3 percent over the budget
estimate.
</P>
<P>
The Al-Shall weekly report today quoted a Kuwaiti Audit Bureau
report on revenues and expenditures in the fiscal year 1995-1996
as saying that actual revenues reached 3.472 billion Kuwaiti
dinars (around 11.5 billion U.S. dollars), 563 million dinars (1.86
billion U.S. dollars) higher than the estimates.
</P>
<P>
The report said that oil revenues reached 3.114 billion dinars
(over 9.3 billion dollars), constituting 89.7 percent of total
revenues, while primary estimates had put oil revenues at 2.49
billion dinars (about 7.4 billion dollars).
</P>
<P>
The increase in oil revenues was achieved due to a price hike
in the international crude markets last year. Kuwait exports
about 2 million barrels of crude oil per day.
</P>
<P>
But the report said some of the oil revenue increase was
countered with a 360-million-dinar (over 1.08 billion dollars)
decrease in non-oil revenues.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Kuwaiti actual expenditures decreased by 2.5
percent, standing at 4.127 billion dinars (over 12.38 billion
dollars) compared with the budgeted 4.23 billion dinars (over
12.69 billion dollars), the report said.
</P>
<P>
Actual revenue rise has resulted in a substantial decrease of
expected budget deficit in the country.
</P>
<P>
According to the previous data, the report said, Kuwaiti
budget deficit in the fiscal year 1995-96 dropped by about 50
percent from an estimate of 1.377 billion dinars (4.55 billion
dollars) to 654 million dinars (2.2 billion dollars).

Deng was in charge of the Secretariat of the CPC Central
Committee for as long as a decade, during which China began the
building of socialism in an all-round way, and the entire Chinese
people, under the leadership of the Communist Party of China, made
great achievements in socialist economic and cultural
construction, and accumulated important experience, while some
serious mistakes were made.
</P>
<P>
For a long time Deng served in the front lines of central
leadership, taking part in making major Party and State decisions
and offering important and correct opinions in many areas. These
were the busiest years of his life. He was active in implementing
the line of the 8th CPC National Congress, pointing out that the
major task was construction and that the Cummunist Party should
accept supervision.
</P>
<P>
In 1958, when the "Great Leap Forward" began and "People's
Communes" were organized throughout the country, "Leftist" errors
began flooding in, followed by three years of difficulties in the
national economy. To summarize experiences and lessons and to
restore normal operations of the national economy, Deng made
investigations in rural areas and put forward many corrective
opinions on some major problems. He was in charge of drafting the
regulations for State enterprises, playing an important role in
the recovery of normal production order, improving and
strengthening enterprise management. He also guided the drafting
of rules for higher eduction institutions under the Ministry of
Education.
</P>
<P>
In February, 1962, the CPC Central Committee held a working
conference attended by 7,000 people to summarize experience, seek
unity of thinking, strengthen unity, and further correct the
errors caused since the Great Leap Forward. In a speech at the
meeting, Deng stressed the importance of upholding democratic
centralism, improving the democratic life of the Party, and
carrying on its fine traditions.

cadred once and for all. In 1962, many officials and people in
rural areas demanded a household responsibility system, because of
serious damages to the rural collective economy by the Great Leap
Forward and People's Communes. So, in July, 1962, Deng suggested
that any productive measure that is good for recovery and for
developing agriculture should be used, and that any method the
people like should be used.
</P>
<P>
While he was general-secretary of the CPC Central Committee,
Deng kept wide contacts with communist party leaders of other
countries. He headed delegations to Moscow for talks with the
Soviet Communist Party many times, during which he upheld the CPC
principle of maintaining independence and initiative.
</P>
<P>
In 1966, Mao Zedong launched the cultural revolution, and
during the next 10 years, Deng was criticized and attacked twice
and removed from all posts. This was the most difficult and
tortuous period in his life. In October, 1969, he was sent to
Xinjian county in east China's Jiangxi Province where he worked at
a bench for half a day every day in a tractor repair factory.
</P>
<P>
During this time, he read a lot of Marxist and Leninist works
and numerous classical and modern Chinese and foreign books. After
Lin Biao's counterrevolutionary plot was smashed, Mao Zedong
developed the idea of letting Deng come back to work. With Zhou
Enlai's support, Deng was reinstated as vice-premier of the State
Council in 1973. He spoke on behalf of the Chinese government at
the United Nations' 6th Special Conference in 1974, systematically
explaining Mao Zedong's theory of the three worlds.
</P>
<P>
In preparing the 4th National People's Congress and considering
the list of candidates for the leadership of the State Council,
Mao said that Deng is "a kind of capable person who is hard to
find and is strong politically and ideologically". Deng was put in
charge of drafting the government work report delivered by Zhou
Enlai at the 1st Plenary Session of the 4th National People's
Congress.
</P>
<P>
In January, 1975, Deng was appointed vice-chairman of the CPC
Central Committee, vice-premier of the State Council,
vice-chairman of the CPC Central Military Commission, and chief of
the PLA General Staff.
</P>
<P>
When Zhou Enlai became seriously ill, Deng handled routine
matters for the CPC, the government, and the military under the
support of Mao Zedong. He fought against the "Gang of Four" tit
for tat and made big efforts to rectify the chaotic situation
brought by the cultural revolution, urging the whole nation to
maintain stability and unite as one to improve the national
economy.

<P>
Taking the railways as a starting point for rectifying the
economy, he instructed departments concerned to draft three
documents: "Some Problems on Speeding Industrial Development",
"Some Problems With Regard to Science and Technology Work" (an
outline of work report) and "On the General Program for All Fields
of Work for the Whole Party and Nation". In a short period of
time, rectifications in the army, industry, agriculture,
communications, science, education, literature and art scored
notable achievements. It was for this that he was supported by the
whole nation.
</P>
<P>
In the beginning, Mao gave him support, but ultimately could
not put up with Deng's systematic correction of the errors of the
cultural revolution and once again launched a campaign to
"criticize Deng and fight back the trend of rightists reversing
verdicts."
</P>
<P>
Zhou Enlai died in January, 1976, and on April 5, there was a
mass demonstration in Tian'anmen Square to mourn Premier Zhou, to
combat the Gang of Four, and to support Deng Xiaoping. The Gang of
Four seized the opportunity to make a case against Deng, and again
he was wrongly dismissed from all posts in the Party and
government.
</P>
<P>
Then, in September, Mao passed away, and in October the Gang of
Four was destroyed and the cultural revolution ended.
</P>
<P>
Which road China should take in the future was a major issue at
the time about which hundreds of millions of Chinese were deeply
concerned. Deng Xiaoping enjoyed very high prestige in the Party
and among the people because he had performed immense feats in the
Chinese revolution and had had great achievements in fighting
against the Gang of Four and in the overall correcting of the
chaotic situation.
</P>
<P>
With the support of Ye Jianying, Chen Yun and others, the 3rd
Plenary Session of the 10th CPC Central Committee decided to
reinstate Deng Xiaoping as vice-chairman of the CPC Central
Committee, vice-premier of the State Council, vice-chairman of the
Central Military Commission, and chief of the PLA General Staff in
July, 1977.
</P>
<P>
At the 11th National Congress of the CPC in August, 1977, Deng
was elected vice-chairman of the CPC Central Committee. In March,
1978, he was elected chairman of the 5th National Committee of the
Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference.
</P>
<P>
In facing up to the many problems that still had to be dealt
with in the country, Deng showed his foresight and wisdom as a
strategist as soon as he came out to work. Grasping the decisive
link among numerous issues, he first promoted rectification on the
ideological front, and led and supported discussions on the
criteria for judging truth.
</P>
<P>
In his "Speech at the Political Work Conference of the Whole
Aarmy" and his talk "Upholding the Banner of Mao Zedong Thought
and Adhering to the Principle of Seeking Truth From Facts", he
opposed the erroneous idea of "two whatevers" that says, "We
should firmly uphold whatever policy decisions Chairman Mao made,
and we should unswervingly adhere to whatever instructions
Chairman Mao gave." Deng pointed out that it is necessary to
understand Mao Zedong Thought in an overall and accurate way,
saying that "seeking truth from facts is the basic point of
departure of Mao Zedong Thought". The deadlock that froze people's
minds for long was broken.

<HEADLINE> Malaysian Leaders Pay Tribute to Deng Xiaoping </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUALA LUMPUR, February 21 (Xinhua) -- Malaysian Prime Minister
Mahathir Mohamad and Foreign Minister Abdullah Ahmad Badawi today
paid tribute to the late Chinese leader Deng Xiaoping.
</P>
<P>
Mahathir regarded Deng as the main architect of China's drive
for reforms towards modernization and the adoption of an open
policy.
</P>
<P>
Deng was also responsible for enhancing China's role in the
maintenance of world peace and stability, he said.
</P>
<P>
Deng's death was "not only a great loss to China but also to
the world," Mahathir said in his condolence message to Chinese
Premier Li Peng which was released by the Foreign Ministry here
today.
</P>
<P>
Mahathir said Deng's innovative approach to China's development
through his doctrine of socialism with Chinese characteristics,
bold vision and outstanding leadership was fundamental in charting
the course of China's dynamic economic development.
</P>
<P>
"China's burgeoning economy today is testimony of the
resounding success of his pragmatic policies," he said.
</P>
<P>
He said Deng's "many visits abroad resulted in China's close
relations, particularly with her neighbors in the East Asian
region."
</P>
<P>
The Malaysian leader said the people of Malaysia recalled
fondly his memorable visit to Malaysia in November 1978 which
paved the way for closer bilateral relations and cooperation
between Malaysia and China.

the government and people of Malaysia, our deepest sympathy and
heartfelt condolences to Your Excellency and, through you, to

Minister Qian Qichen.

Abdullah said as an outstanding statesman, Deng had made an
important contribution towards regional and international peace
and stability.

<HEADLINE> Deng Xiaoping's Great, Brilliant Life (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, February 21 (Xinhua) -- Deng Xiaoping was an
outstanding leader whose high prestige was recognized by the
Party, the military, and the people of all ethnic groups
throughout China. He was a great Marxist, a great proletarian
revolutionary, statesman, military strategist and diplomat, and a
long tested communist fighter, the chief architect of China's
socialist reforms, opening up, and modernization drive, and the
founder of the theory of building socialism with Chinese
characteristics.
</P>
<P>
Deng Xiaoping's life was a brilliant life as a fighter. In his
magnificent revolutionary career spanning more than seven decades,
he made indelible contributions to the victory of China's New
Democratic Revolution and the founding of New China, and to the
establishment, consolidation and growth of socialism in China.
</P>
<P>
He was born August 22, 1904, in Paifang village, Xiexing
township of Guangan County, in Sichuan Province. His original name
was Deng Xiansheng. Where he was sent to an old-style school at
the age of five, he was given the school name of Deng
Xixian. Afterwards he transferred to a new-style primary school,
then went on to Guangan County High School, after passing the
entrance exam. In the fall of 1919, he went to Chongqing
Preparatory School for students going to France on a work-study
program.
</P>
<P>
There he was influenced by the May 4 Movement, and began to
embrace the idea of "Saving China by Developing Industry". He and
his schoolmates took part in the campaign to boycott Japanese
goods and to condemn China's traitors. In the summer of 1920 he
went to France on the work-study program.

<P>
Because of the difficulties of life in France, Deng had to work
in several factories after studying in a high school only for
several months, where he experienced the hardships of life and was
bitterly exploited by the capitalists. During that period, he and
a group of other Chinese students with progressive ideas began to
believe in Marxism and became revolutionaries, having been
influenced by the October Socialist Revolution in Russia.
</P>
<P>
In 1922, he joined the Chinese Youth Communist Party in Europe
(later renamed the European branch of the Chinese Socialist Youth
League), and in 1924 became a member of the Chinese Communist
Party. From that time on, he became a professional proletarian
revolutionary and a communist fighter.
</P>
<P>
He served as a leading member of the Youth League's general
branch in Europe and a special commissioner of the Chinese
Communist Party to the Leon region. He also took the position of
editor of the Youth League's magazine, "The Red Light".
</P>
<P>
In early 1926, Deng left France for the Soviet Union, where he
studied at the Institute of the Peoples of the East and in the
Name of Sun Yat-sen. In his autobiography of that time he wrote,
"If I stay in Russia for only a day, I will study hard for a day,
so that I can understand Communism well," and "As soon as I
arrived in Moscow, I made up my mind to give my body to our Party,
and to our class."
</P>
<P>
In the Spring of 1927, Deng was ordered by the Party to return
to China, where he served as chief of the Political Division and a
political instructor at the Zhongshan Military School in Xi'an of
the National Allied Army under Feng Yuxiang's command, while also
serving as secretary of the Communist Party organization in the
school.
</P>
<P>
When Chiang Kai-shek staged the April 12 counter-revolutionary
coup d'etat in Shanghai, Deng went to Hankou sometime between June
and July and worked in the Chinese Communist Party Central
Committee offices.

<P>
Not long after that, the Wuhan Government under Wang Jingwei
openly turned against the Communists. The nation was under the
"white" terror and the Chinese Communist Party was forced to go
underground. In response to the circumstances, Deng changed his
name to Xiaoping.
</P>
<P>
On August 7 he attended an emergency meeting of the Chinese
Communist Party Central Committee (known as the August 7 Meeting),
which repudiated and rectified the "right capitulationism"
advocated by Chen Duxiu and which set down the general policy of
starting an agrarian revolution and staging armed struggles
against the Kuomintang reactionaries. Towards the end of that
year, he moved with the offices of the CPC Central Committee
secretly to Shanghai.
</P>
<P>
From 1928 to 1929, he served as secretary general of the CPC
Central Committee. In 1928, when the CPC was holding its Sixth
National Congress in Moscow, he helped those CPC Central Committee
leaders who had stayed in China to arrange the daily work of the
CPC Central Committee.
</P>
<P>
After the failure of the great revolution in 1927, the Chinese
Communist Party staged a series of armed uprisings in order to
save the revolution. In the summer of 1929, as the CPC Central
Committee representative, Deng went to Guangxi province to lead an
uprising.
</P>
<P>
Using the name Deng Bin, he served as secretary of the Guangxi
Front Committee of the CPC. Along with Zhang Yunyi and others he
staged the Baise Uprising in December, created the 7th Red Army,
and established the Youjiang Revolutionary Base.
</P>
<P>
In February of the following year, he launched the Longzhou
Uprising, formed the 8th Red Army, and established the Zuojiang
Revolutionary Base. In the process he became political commissar
and secretary of the Front Committee.
</P>
<P>
Under the leadership of Deng Xiaoping and others, the number of
Red Army soldiers grew to 7,000 in about four months, and the
areas under their control grew to more than 20 counties and some
one million people, believed to be one of the bigger revolutionary
bases at the time.
</P>
<P>
But because of the influence of the erroneous "left adventurism"
in the Party, the troops experienced a series of setbacks in
battles and had to trek 3,500 kilometers to join the main Red Army
in the area of the Jiangxi Central Revolutionary Base.
</P>
<P>
Deng had put forward ideas opposing the erroneous "Left"
command methods, but they were not adopted. In February 1931, he
was sent by the Front Committee to report on their work to the CPC
Central Committee in Shanghai. During this period, he wrote the
"Work Report of the 7th Army", explaining the 7th Army's situation
in detail and summing up the experiences before and after the
uprising.

<HEADLINE> Ramos Approves Privatization of Manila Waterworks </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, February 21 (Xinhua) -- Philippine President Fidel
Ramos today approved the privatization of the Manila water service
system worth 7 billion U.S. dollars, the largest of its kind in
the world.
</P>
<P>
Under the recommendation of the Committee on Privatization,
Ramos endorsed the project won by two local firms, the
Presidential Office said in a press release.
</P>
<P>
The approval came after the Court of Appeals lifted a temporary
restraining order it issued last month to freeze the privatization
of the water supply and sewerage system in the capital region.
</P>
<P>
To improve efficiency of the water system in Manila, the
government chose to privatize the Metropolitan Water Supply and
Sewerage System (MWSS). Under concessional agreements, the MWSS
will be turned over to the two winning bidders in June.
</P>
<P>
Public Works and Highways Secretary Gregorio Vigilar hailed the
lifting of the court order and today's approval, saying it would
create a more favorable perception by foreign investors of the
country's investment climate.

In the summer of 1931, Deng arrived in the Central
Revolutionary Base in Jiangxi, and served successively as
secretary of the CPC Ruijin County Committee, secretary of the CPC
Central County Committee of Huichang, and head of the Propaganda
Department of the CPC Jiangxi Provincial Committee.
</P>
<P>
At that time, the Provisional CPC Central Committee, which
pursued "Left adventurism", moved from Shanghai to the Central
Revolutionary Base. Deng along with Mao Zetan, Xie Weijun, Gu Bo,
and others persevered in proceeding from specific conditions and
followed the correct political line as represented by Mao Zedong.
</P>
<P>
They opposed the theory of taking cities as the revolutionary
center, and held that the revolutionary force should develop in
the vast rural area where the enemy's power was relatively
weak. They were against military adventurism, and advocated luring
the enemy in deep, and opposed the practice of expanding the main
force of the Red Army by weakening local armed forces, and stood
for equal emphasis be placed on the development of both
forces. They also spoke out against the "Left" policy of land
distribution.
</P>
<P>
The Provisional CPC Central Committee launched a struggle
against the above-mentioned four men, and Deng was stripped of his
position as head of the Provincial Party Committee, given a
serious disciplinary punishment and a warning inside the Party,
and sent to the outlying county of Le'an to serve as an inspector
of the CPC Nancun District Committee. This was the first wrongful
disciplinary punishment he had suffered in his political life in
the Party.
</P>
<P>
Later, with the support of Wang Jiaxiang, director of the
General Political Department of the Central Military Commission,
and other people, he was transferred to the General Political
Department to serve as secretary general. Shortly afterwards, he
was in charge of the Red Star News, the Department's paper.

Proceeding from specific conditions, he published a number of
articles and delivered speeches on "The Party and The
Anti-Japanese Democratic Political Power", "Principles, Tasks, and
Orientation of Efforts in Cultural Work of The 129th Division", "A
Outlined Summary of The Struggle Against The Enemy During the Past
Five Years", "Economic Construction of The Taihang Mountain Area",
and "Speech at The Mobilization Meeting for The Rectification
Movement at The Party School of The Northern Bureau of the CPC
Central Committee".
</P>
<P>
In these articles and speeches, he proposed a series of
policies and tactics for the struggle against the enemy, and set
forth the principles of accumulating strength to prepare for the
strategic counterattack and the founding of the New China in the
post-war period.
</P>
<P>
In his speech at a mobilization meeting for the Rectification
Movement at the Party school of the Northern Bureau of the CPC
Central Committee, he pointed out that Mao Zedong thought is
Marxism-Leninism with Chinese characteristics and should become
the Party's guide.
</P>
<P>
In June of 1945, Deng was elected a member of the CPC Central
Committee at the Party's Seventh National Congress. When Japan
surrendered in August, the four base areas that he and Liu Bocheng
founded in north China -- the Taihang, Taiyue, South Hebei, and
Hebei-Shandong-Henan -- were basically linked with each other, and
became the largest liberated area in the country, an area of 24
million people and 300,000 soldiers.
</P>
<P>
Also in August, the CPC Central Committee decided to set up the
Shanxi-Hebei-Shandong-Henan Bureau of the CPC Central Committee
and the Shanxi-Hebei-Shandong-Henan Military Region. Deng became
secretary of the Bureau and political commissar of the Military
Region, with Liu Bocheng as commander-in-chief.

<P>
In December of 1939, when the War of Resistance Against Japan
was stalemated, Kuomintang diehards started the First Upsurge
against Communist Party-led forces with large-scale military
attacks on the Taihang District, where the headquarters of the
Eighth Route Army and the 129th Division were located.
</P>
<P>
In March, 1940, at the head of troops from the
Shanxi-Qahar-Hebei Military Region, Deng and Liu struck back and
completely destroyed the Kuomintang diehards' force of more than
10,000 men.
</P>
<P>
To halt the Japanese army's mopping-up operations against the
base areas of north China, and to stop the Japanese "prisoner's
cage" policy beginning August of 1940, the Eighth Route Army began
large-scale sabotage of Japanese-held communication lines and
strongholds in north China, known as the "Great Campaign of One
Hundred Regiments".
</P>
<P>
In this campaign, the 38 regiments under Liu and Deng's command
fought more than 500 small and large battles, dealing a heavy blow
to the Japanese army and their puppet troops.
</P>
<P>
In September of 1942, Deng assumed the post of secretary of the
Taihang Sub-Bureau of the CPC Central Committee. In October of the
next year, when Peng Dehuai and Liu Bocheng went back to Yan'an to
take part in the Rectification Movement, he became acting
secretary of the Northern Bureau of the CPC Central Committee,
taking charge of the work of the Eighth Route Army headquarters
and all-round work to lead the Party, the government, and the
military in anti-Japanese base areas in the enemy's rear areas in
north China.
</P>
<P>
Adhering to the principles of facing the enemy-occupied area,
facing the communication lines, and advancing while the enemy
troops advances, he engaged in active and flexible guerrilla
warfare, and directed the troops to smash the mopping-up
operations of the Japanese army and their puppet troops.
</P>
<P>
He also scored great successes in leading the area in building
the Party, the army, and political power, and in carrying out a
series of movements, such as the Rectification Movement, effecting
Better Troops and Streamlined Administration, Reducing Land Rent
and Loan Interest, and launching the Great Production Campaign.

<P>
In October of 1934, Deng joined the Long March of the Central
Red Army, and became secretary general of the CPC Central
Committee at the end of the year.
</P>
<P>
In January, 1935, he participated in the Zunyi Meeting, which
established the correct leadership of a new CPC Central Committee,
represented by Mao Zedong, marking a great, significant turn in
the history of the CPC.
</P>
<P>
After the First and the Fourth Front Red Armies joined forces,
he served as head of propaganda of the Political Department of the
First Army Group, and later became deputy director and director of
the Department.
</P>
<P>
In 1937, the Japanese imperialists launched an all-round war of
aggression against China. Facing a powerful enemy, the Kuomintang
and the CPC began their second cooperation. The Chinese Workers'
and Peasants' Red Army was re-designated as the Eighth Route Army
of the National Revolutionary Army.
</P>
<P>
In August 1937, Deng was appointed deputy director of the
Political Department of the Eighth Route Army and hurried to the
front in the War of Resistance against Japan in north China. In
January of 1938, he became the political commissar of the 129th
Division of the Eighth Route Army, with Liu Bocheng as
commander-in-chief.
</P>
<P>
Deng and Liu led the 129th Division far into rear areas of
Japanese occupied territory, and tried to expand into the plains
with the help of mountainous areas, with the Taihang Mountains as
the center.
</P>
<P>
When getting a firm foothold in the Taihang Mountains after a
series of battles, they sent troops to arouse the masses of
people, organize anti-Japanese armed forces, and set up
anti-Japanese democratic power, founding the Shanxi-Hebei-Henan
Anti-Japanese Base Area.
</P>
<P>
They then led their troops to cross the Beiping-Hankou Railway,
marched eastward to the plains of southern Hebei Province, and set
up the South Hebei Anti-Japanese Base. They also founded the
Taiyue Base and the Hebei-Shandong-Henan Base, formed from a
number of smaller base areas, such as West Shandong Base.

<P>
After the victory in the War of Resistance against Japanese
Aggression, the Kuomintang, while negotiating a peace settlement
with the CPC, launched a series of local wars.
</P>
<P>
The Shanxi-Hebei-Shandong-Henan Liberated Area in the Central
China Plain, under the leadership of Liu Bocheng and Deng
Xiaoping, blocked the passage of Kuomintang troops to the North
and Northeast China Liberated areas and was a key strategic
military area.
</P>
<P>
This area bore the brunt of the Kuomintang force. In September
1945, Deng and Liu were in command at the famous Shangdang
Campaign. During the campaign all the Kuomintang troops invading
the interior of the liberated area were wiped out, and the
Shanxi-Hebei-Shandong-Henan Liberated Area was consolidated.
</P>
<P>
Later, Deng and Liu led a march eastward to intercept
Kuomintang troops heading northward along the Beiping-Hankou
Railway Line, and achieved a victory at Handan Campaign.
</P>
<P>
The two victories effectively halted Kuomintang troops' attacks
on liberated areas and greatly strengthened CPC status in
negotiations in Chongqing, playing a significant role in reaching
an armistice agreement.
</P>
<P>
In June 1946, Chiang Kai-shek launched an all-out civil
war. Liu Bocheng and Deng Xiaoping led the main force of the
Shanxi-Hebei-Shandong-Henan Field Army in mobile warfare north and
south of the Longhai (Lianyungong-Lanzhou) Railway, advancing and
retreating with big strokes and fighting continuously large-scale
battles at Longhai, Dingtao and Juye, wiping out effective
strength of Kuomintang troops in big numbers.
</P>
<P>
In May 1947, Deng served as secretary o the Central China
Plains Bureau of the CPC Central Committee. In June of that year,
in accordance with strategic arrangements made by the CPC Central
Committee and Mao Zedong on changing strategic defense to
strategic attack and taking the war to Kuomintang-ruled areas, he
and Liu led the 120,000-strong main force of the
Shanxi-Hebei-Shandong-Henan Field Army in crossing the natural
barrier of the Yellow River and eliminating more than 56,000 enemy
troops in southwest Shandong Province after 28 days of continuous
fighting, thereby opening the passageway southward.
</P>
<P>
His troops later fell on the enemy suddenly, driving straight
in, fighting in front and in the rear while being pursued by tens
of thousands of enemy troops, and marching hundreds of kilometers
to the Dabie Mountains, a prelude to the strategic offensive in
the Chinese People's War of Liberation.
</P>
<P>
After entering the Dabie Mountain area, the troops of Liu and
Deng constituted a direct threat to the vast Kuomintang-ruled
areas south of the Yangtze River, forcing the Kuomintang troops to
send their main force back to assist.

<P>
As a result, the number of enemy troops encircling the Dabie
Mountain area was increased to about 200,000, making the struggle
there extremely difficult. Deng encouraged troops by saying: "As
long as we shoulder the heavy burden in the Dabie Mountains, other
troops and areas will be able to wipe out large numbers of enemy
troops and carry on the work in a thoroughgoing way. This is
extremely helpful for the overall situation. We must hold on no
matter how weak we become and what kind of hardships we have to
endure."
</P>
<P>
Liu and Deng led the troops and people in the Dabie Mountain
Revolutionary Base to attack enemy troops in an active and
flexible way, breaking rounds of the "encirclement and
suppression" by large numbers of Kuomintang troops in the
mountainous area.
</P>
<P>
Liu's and Deng's troops in the Dabie Mountains formed a
triangle in the central Chinese area with two other field armies
marching southward, thereby containing 90 of the over 160 enemy
brigades stationed on the southern line, extending the battle
front from south and north of the Yellow River to the northern
bank of the Yangtze River, and changing Central China from an
important rear area where Kuomintang troops attacked liberated
areas into a forward position for the PLA to win the national
victory.
</P>
<P>
In May 1948, Deng Xiaoping served as the first secretary of the
enlarged Central China Plains Bureau of the CPC Central Committee,
and as political commissar of the Central China Plains Military
Command and the Central China Plains Field Army.
</P>
<P>
In the course of establishing the New Central China Plains
Liberated Area, Deng, in his speeches and instructions, expressed
the following topics: "Victorious Situation after We Marched into
the Central China Plains and Our Future Policy and Tactics";
"Implementing the Instructions of the CPC Central Committee on
Land Reform and the Work to Consolidate the Party"; and "Views on
Entering New Areas in the Future".
</P>
<P>
In accordance with the principle of the CPC Central Committee
and proceeding from specific conditions in the newly liberated
parts of central China, Deng raised many important views and
suggestions on Party consolidation, land reform, and industrial
and commercial policies. His views and suggestions got approval
and praise from the CPC Central Committee and Mao Zedong.
</P>
<P>
Since the spring of 1948, the Central China Plains Field Army
cooperated with the East China Field Army to fight a series of
battles at Luoyang, Wanxi, Wandong, Yudong, Xiangfan and other
places, smashing Kuomintang's defensive system in the Central
China Plains.
</P>
<P>
From September 1948 to January 1949, in accordance with
strategic arrangements of the CPC Central Committee and the
Central Commission, the PLA launched three decisive campaigns of
Liaoshen, Huaihai and Beiping-Tianjin, which eliminated the main
military strength on which Chiang Kai-shek relied for his
reactionary rule.

<HEADLINE> New Income Tax Law Comes into Effect in Vietnam </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HANOI, February 21 (Xinhua) -- New income tax law comes into
effect this week in Vietnam, raising the threshold for both
Vietnamese citizens and foreigners classified as residents, as
well as abolishing tax on gifts remitted to the Vietnamese
citizens from abroad.
</P>
<P>
Local press quoted deputy Finance Minister Nguyen Thi Kim Ngan
as saying that the much-criticized irregular income tax previously
imposed on gifts in cash and in kind transferred by Vietnamese
living overseas to their family members and friends was now
abolished.
</P>
<P>
The official said the new income tax law aims at encouraging
more money to be sent home through the banks, the only official
transaction channel.
</P>
<P>
Those items still subject to irregular income tax include
lottery prizes, the transfer of technology, the rights to use
business patents and trademarks, technical know-how technical
designs for construction projects, industrial designs and other
services, except for those which are certified as gifts.
</P>
<P>
The deputy finance minister said that instead of the minimum
taxable 1.2 million Vietnam Dong (about 108 U.S. dollars) monthly
salary or earnings for Vietnamese citizens, the new rate was an
amount higher than 2 million Vietnam Dong (About 180 dollars) per
month.
</P>
<P>
For foreigners who are regarded as permanent residents in
Vietnam and Vietnamese people working overseas, the new threshold
before tax is paid is more than 5 million Vietnam Dong (about 440
dollars ) a month.
</P>
<P>
For foreigners who are considered non-residents in Vietnam,
their taxable income is "the total of what they earn while working
in Vietnam," according to the revised ordinance signed by
President Le Duc Anh on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The ordinance also states that those individual income payers
who have an average monthly after-tax income of more than 8
million Vietnam Dong (about 720 dollars) are liable to pay an
additional 30 percent tax.

<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, February 21 (Xinhua) -- French President Jacques Chirac
has paid his tribute to Deng Xiaoping who died in Beijing on
Wednesday night.
</P>
<P>
Deng "will remain in the memories as one of the greatest
figures of the history of China," Chirac said on Wednesday in his
condolence messages to Chinese President Jiang Zemin and Zhuo Lin,
the wife of Deng.
</P>
<P>
"Deng Xiaoping will remain in the history as the principal
artisan of the transformations that China has known over the past
20 years, which I could fully measure from my trips (to China) in
1978 and 1991," the French president said.
</P>
<P>
He said: "After having shown his qualities of strategy during
the years which preceded the founding of the People's Republic of
China, he imposed himself with his pragmatism and his vision for
the future, which allowed your country to engage in an
irreversible way on the road of opening and reforms."
</P>
<P>
Chirac said that France "received him on its soil with other
future (Chinese) leaders in the early 1920s " and it "received him
again, in an official way, half a century later, at the moment
when he was preparing with courage for the decisive revolvings" of
the history of China.
</P>
<P>
"His exceptional destiny led him to exercise the very high
responsibilities on the top of your country, which he has engaged
-- in less than one generation -- on the road of accelerated
modernization and an opening to the world without precedent," said
Chirac.
</P>
<P>
He said, "In this century, few men could have led such a vast
human community in changes which are as profound and as
determining as those which he did," he said.
</P>
<P>
Deng Xiaoping as vice premier paid an official visit to France
in 1975 when Chirac was French prime minister.

<HEADLINE> U.S. to Accept Any Israeli-Palestinian Accord, </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, February 21 (Xinhua) -- The United States no
longer advocates a full Israeli withdrawal to the 1967 borders
and will agree to whatever agreement to be reached by Israel and
Palestine, a key Israeli government adviser said today.
</P>
<P>
Prime Minister Binyamin Netanyahu's senior policy adviser Dore
Gold, who just returned from talks with U.S. officials, was quoted
by the English daily The Jerusalem Post as saying that the
U.S. conception of the final status of the territories had
undergone changes since the mid-1980s.
</P>
<P>
Former U.S. President Ronald Reagan issued a plan that called
for full Israeli withdrawal from the territories captured in the
1967 war with Arabs, a position identical to the one expressed by
the then U.S. Secretary of State William Rogers in 1969, the
report said.
</P>
<P>
"There is a belief in the Israeli public that in (the late
U.S. President Richard) Nixon's safe there is the Rogers' plan
and that every president signs on to it," Gold was quoted as
saying.
</P>
<P>
Gold, who acknowledged the huge gap between Israeli and
Palestinian positions on the final status, said the U.S. was no
longer insistent on a withdrawal to the 1967 borders. He added
that this reflected such changes as low oil prices and the
collapse of the Soviet Union.
</P>
<P>
"There have been many developments in the U.S. conception on
final status," Gold said. "The U.S. prefers not to express a
position. It will agree to whatever agreement is reached by the
two parties."
</P>
<P>
Gold also said the U.S. accepted the Netanyahu government's
insistence that the Palestinians and other Arabs show reciprocity
in their relations with Israel.
</P>
<P>
He added that the U.S. was committed to expanding Israel's
limited relations with the Gulf states and North Africa, as well
as forging new ties with other Middle East countries.
</P>
<P>
The Israeli-Palestinian final status talks, first convened
last May but suspended so far, will settle the thorny issues of
deciding the final borders, status of Jerusalem and fate of
Palestinian refugees.
</P>
<P>
Until now, no date has yet been set for restarting the
final-status talks though the Netanyahu government has promised
to begin the negotiations soon following last month's signing of
Hebron agreement under the intensive U.S. mediation.
</P>
<P>
Israel's troop withdrawal from most of Hebron has also eased
tension with its Arab neighbors, which have virtually frozen the
process of normalization with the Jewish states since
Netanyahu's access to power last June.
</P>
<P>
Currently, the two sides are holding negotiations on issues
related to the interim agreement, such as the opening of safe
passages between the West Bank and Gaza Strip, the construction
of the Gaza airport and Gaza sea port, and development of
economic and security cooperations.

<HEADLINE> Netanyahu Repeats Intention to Build Jewish Settlement </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, February 21 (Xinhua) -- Israeli Prime Minister
Binyamin Netanyahu reiterated his decision Thursday night to
implement the controversial building plan for a large Jewish
settlement in Har Homa in East Jerusalem, reported the state-run
Israel Radio.
</P>
<P>
Netanyahu told reporters in Tel Aviv that Israel will build
unconditionally and without restrictions in all parts of
Jerusalem. He added that he intends to bring his plan for
approval next week to the Ministerial Committee on Jerusalem
Affairs.
</P>
<P>
He said he will also propose building houses for Arab
populations alongside the Jewish settlement in the same area. He
claimed that Israel will commit itself to allowing the Arabs to
have same status as Jewish inhabitants in Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
On Monday, Netanyahu announced his decision to seek approval
for Har Homa project after a week of crisis in his rightwing
coalition. Some parties said they would quit if the project did
not go through and others threatened to abstain on critical vote
in Knesset (Parliament).
</P>
<P>
The internal crisis, accompanied by Palestinians' warning of
violent opposition, started over the weekend when it was reported
that the premier promised U.S. President Bill Clinton not to build
Har Homa Jewish neighborhood. But Netanyahu denied the report.
</P>
<P>
The Har Homa project was drawn up by the late prime minister
Yitzhak Rabin, but it never materialized. Shimon Peres, former
Labor prime minister and now opposition leader, said that the
project should be implemented, but the government should also
take into consideration the consequences that may arise.
</P>
<P>
Palestinian President Yasser Arafat said in Ankara Thursday
that the U.S. and Russia as well as Europe should pressure Israel
not to build the Jewish settlement in East Jerusalem, which
Palestinians see as their would-be independent state.
</P>
<P>
Jordanian King Hussein Thursday also called on Israel to
consider its decision saying that the building will have negative
effect on the peace process. The king is likely to raise the issue
during Netanyahu's forthcoming visit to Jordan.

<HEADLINE> Water Hyacinth Causes Huge Loss to Uganda </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KAMPALA, February 21 (Xinhua) -- Uganda is losing one million
U.S. Dollars worth of fish every month due to speedy multiplying
of water hyacinth in the country's waters.
</P>
<P>
Vice-President and Minister of Agriculture Wandira Kazibwe
said the situation will be worsening if the weed continue
multiplying.
</P>
<P>
She said the weed has to be sprayed with weed-killer
chemicals, otherwise Ugandans would risk losing all the fish in
Lake Victoria.
</P>
<P>
She also discussed the matter with outgoing British High
Commissioner Edward Clay here on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Water hyacinth has now strangled 90 percent of the shoreline
of rivers and lakes, a stretch of about 2,000 km. The Ugandan
government, which is choosing some places to try weed-killers, is
being criticized by some scientists.
</P>
<P>
Fishery has been playing an important role in Uganda's economy
in recent years, earning the country 20 million U.S. Dollars per
year by export. But the weed calamity is threatening its further
expansion.

<P>
However, the president praised the opposition parties for
their contribution to the prevailing peace and stability
following the 1995 general elections.

<P>
"The prevailing peace and stability has brought great honor to
our nation as some detractors thought the country would be

Mkapa said examples were abundant in Africa where some
political parties refused to accept election results and plunged
their countries into civil strife.

He pointed out that unity, love and solidarity should be the
hallmark of Tanzanians, ignoring their political, religious and
racial differences.
</P>
<P>
The president added that the opposition has the right to
criticize the government's shortcomings but will not be allowed
to block its programs.

<HEADLINE> US Submits Trade Complaint Against Japan to WTO </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, February 20 (Xinhua) -- The United States submitted
today a trade complaint against Japan to the World Trade
Organization (WTO) over whether Eastman Kodak has been blocked
from competing in the Japanese market.
</P>
<P>
"We believe the record demonstrates that for more than 30
years, Japan has limited the sale of imported consumer
photographic film and paper in the Japanese market," said Charlene
Barshefsky, U.S. acting Trade Representative.
</P>
<P>
"To do so Japan has relied upon an extensive array of measures
designed to offset the effects of tariff, import and foreign
investment liberalization," she said.
</P>
<P>
She added it was not a commercial case between Kodak and Fuji
Photo Film Inc. of Japan, but "a trade dispute between the United
States and Japan."
</P>
<P>
Japan has until early April to reply to the U.S. statement
supported by 10 volumes of documents, before a decision is
expected to be made by WTO in October.
</P>
<P>
Japan and Fuji have both denied accusations that they have
conspired to keep Kodak out of the Japanese market. In its own
filing to the WTO, Japan said it is willing to discuss the issue
as long as the WTO also reviewed its allegations of unfair
barriers that had been erected against foreign companies in the
U.S. market.
</P>
<P>
The fight is the latest one between the U.S. and Japan after
the trade disputes over car parts, insurance and lumber.

<HEADLINE> Deng Leaves Lasting Legacy for China: Kenyan </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, February 21 (Xinhua) -- The policies initiated by
China's late leader Deng Xiaoping will remain in place, which is
"good for China", said a Kenyan newspaper, commenting on the
impact of Deng's passing away on China's future.
</P>
<P>
In an editorial entitled "Deng's Legacy May Keep China Going",
Daily Nation noted that the political leadership in China will
close ranks as the Chinese mourned Deng who passed away on
Wednesday night.
</P>
<P>
The paper pointed out that under Deng's guidance China
recorded a double-digit economic growth during the past dozen
years.
</P>
<P>
After Deng introduced his market-oriented economic reforms and
open-door policies, "the former sleeping giant stirred and awoke
-- and the world took notice," said the paper.
</P>
<P>
Deng should especially be credited with his "one country, two
systems" approach to Hong Kong which would remain its capitalist
system after returning to China on July 1, 1997 while Beijing
sticks to socialism.
</P>
<P>
Deng also pursued a policy of peaceful reunification with
Taiwan which is an integral part of China.
</P>
<P>
The paper stressed that growing prosperity of China is "Deng's
enduring legacy".
</P>
<P>
In a condolence message sent to Chinese President Jiang Zemin
on Thursday, Kenyan President Daniel arap Moi said economic
reforms and open-door policies initiated by Deng Xiaoping had
turned China into one of the world's fastest growing economies.
</P>
<P>
The Kenyan leader pointed out that Deng's achievements will
continue to be admired by the world and will leave a lasting
legacy.
</P>
<P>
Moi noted that Deng will be remembered as a great leader who
served his country with dedication and commitment.

LUSAKA, February 21 (Xinhua) -- Many Zairean refugees who

hoped to be taken back home instead of lodging in refugee centers.

Justin Mbayo, a former teacher who fled from Kamile, said it

Lumbu Muyumba, who was former Kamile governor, preferred to be
transferred to Zaire's capital of Kinshasa, saying that most
members of his family are in Kinshasa except his wife, six
children and one grand daughter who are together with him in
Mpulungu.

<P>
However, some other refugees felt it would be safer to remain
in Zambia until the war in eastern Zaire is over.

BEIJING, February 21 (Xinhua) -- The Chinese People will carry
out the behest of Deng Xiaoping, the late leader of China, to
enhace the friendly cooperation with countries in the Asia-Pacific
region and in the world at large, said Qiao Shi, China's top
legislator.
</P>
<P>
Qiao, chairman of the National People's Congress (NPC) Standing
Committee, made the remarks here today during his meeting with
members of the Beijing Committee of the Association of the
Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN).
</P>
<P>
Mohamad Amia Jaafar, Malaysian ambassador to China and chairman
of the ASEAN Beijing Committee, on behalf of the governments and
peoples of ASEAN, expressed profound condolences over the death of
Deng Xiaoping.
</P>
<P>
He said that Deng made historical contributions not only to the
great cause of the Chinese people, but also to peace and stability
in the Asia-Pacific region, and to the international community.
</P>
<P>
Expressing thanks for Jaafar's statement, Qiao said that Deng
has devoted all his life to the Chinese people's cause of
liberation and socialist construction, and the Chinese people, who
are mourning over his death, will study his thought and push
forward China's socialist construction.
</P>
<P>
Deng has also made outstanding contributions to peace and
development in the Asia-Pacific region and in the world at large,
he added.
</P>
<P>
He stated that without Deng's outstanding leadership and his
theory on building socialism with Chinese characteristics, China,
the most populous country in the world, would not be able to
achieve today's successes in reform, opening-up and modernization.
</P>
<P>
Deng's theory will continue to be taken as the guidance over
China's development, he said.
</P>
<P>
Qiao also spoke highly of China's friendly ties and cooperation
with ASEAN countries, as well as ASEAN's important role in
safeguarding peace and stability in the region, saying that China
and ASEAN have common interests and objectives in many aspects.

ambassadors to China of seven ASEAN countries.

LUSAKA, February 21 (Xinhua) -- Zambian President Frederick
Chiluba said he was shocked at the state of disrepair of the
roads in capital Lusaka and ordered to immediately revoke the
contracts with some irresponsible companies.

During a road inspection on Thursday, the president demanded
Housing Minister Bennie Mwiinga hand in a list of all road
contractors, according to a Zambia Daily Mail report today.
</P>
<P>
After seeing Lusaka's major roads which were in what he
described as a "shameful" state, Chiluba said it was corruption
and he was suspicious about the relations between the firms and
some government officials.
</P>
<P>
"I am directing that the roads be dug out completely and work
must be certified professionally before commencement. It is not
right that roads be re-done every year," said Chiluba.
</P>
<P>
He also noted that the bad roads in the city contributed to
the high crime rate involving car thefts as most of the vehicles
are grabbed at a gun point after failing to drive on the good
roads.

<HEADLINE> Anniversary of Shanghai Communique Marked </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW YORK, February 20 (Xinhua) -- Acting Secretary of State
Peter Tarnoff and several former U.S. secretaries of state
gathered in New York on Thursday to mark the 25th anniversary of
the Shanghai Communique, which reopened the door to Sino-U.S.
relations and initiated the normalization process.
</P>
<P>
The former U.S. secretaries of state Dr. Henry Kissinger, Cyrus
Vance, Alexander M. Haig and William P. Rogers attended the
ceremony. Chinese Ambassador to the United States Li Daoyu was
also present.
</P>
<P>
In a greeting message, which was read out at the ceremony,
U.S. President Clinton expressed his "appreciation" for the former
secretaries attending the event and "recognition" of them in
making that historical moment and of their follow-up activities
that brought the United States and China closer.
</P>
<P>
Clinton said that he is exercising the exact engagment policy
towards China that has been exercised in the past quarter of
century.
</P>
<P>
Kissinger began a speech by reading a letter from Former
President Bush, who said "It is not a secret that no bilateral
relationship is more important to world peace than the U.S.-China
relationship." He commended all those who have helped facilitate
U.S. relationship with China.
</P>
<P>
In recalling the signing of the historic communique, Kissinger
noted specially that it did not only list what the two sides
agreed but also what they didn't. He hoped the U.S. government to
apply lessons of the Cold War to the current Chinese-American
relations.
</P>
<P>
Vance and Haig all highly valued the Shanghai Communique,
hoping both China and the United States to solve the present
tensions and problems through patient dialogues.
</P>
<P>
Li Daoyu said the best way to commemorate the Shanghai
Communique is for both China and the United States to emulate the
vision and courage exemplified by the leaders of the two countries
25 years ago and to reaffirm and carry forward the principles of
the three Sino-US Joint Communiques.
</P>
<P>
"History had testified," he said, "that if both sides put our
relations in a global, strategic and long-term perspective, if
both sides handle bilateral differences in accordance with the
three Joint Communiques and through consultations in the spirit of
mutual respect and equality, we can gradually narrow down our
differences and resolve them."

<HEADLINE> China's Tarim Basin Expected to Produce 4.4 Million Tons of Oil </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
URUMQI, February 21 (Xinhua) -- The Tarim Basin in northwest
China's Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region expects to produce 4.4
million tons of crude oil this year.
</P>
<P>
The 560,000-sq-km Basin is estimated to have 10.8 billion tons
of oil reserves and 8,400 billion cu m of natural gas reserves,
accounting for one-seventh and one-quarter, respectively of the
country's total reserves.
</P>
<P>
It is considered an important strategic area for China's oil
industry. To accelerate oil development there, in April of 1989
the China National Petroleum Corporation set up the Tarim Basin
Oil Exploration and Development Headquarters.
</P>
<P>
In an interview with Xinhua, Liao Yongyuan, senior engineer and
deputy head of the Headquarters, told reporters that this year
they will concentrate on intensifying oil exploration in major
areas and try to find 150 million tons of oil reserves and 50
billion cu m of natural gas reserves.
</P>
<P>
Oil production in the basin has been confined to crude oil for
the time being, and the basin has almost no natural gas
production. Little natural gas is now produced and most is burned
off during oil production.
</P>
<P>
As an experimental area for oil development reforms, the
Headquarters has tried to apply the advanced management techniques
of major oil companies elsewhere and has seen fast growth in
exploration.
</P>
<P>
By the end of last year, workers had discovered ten complete
oil and gas fields, 26 industrial oil-bearing strata, and had
verified 1.47 billion tons of reserves. The basin produced 3.15
million tons of crude oil last year, putting it eighth in China,
with 142 million yuan in sales.
</P>
<P>
More than 20,000 workers have, in the past eight years,
produced an oil development bonanza there, even with its harsh
environment and natural conditions, said the 36-year-old senior
engineer.
</P>
<P>
The basin has a success rate of 46 percent in oil wells, 20
percentage points higher than the world's rate for deep-stratum
oil exploration. It also costs 144 million yuan less than the
national average to develop an oilfield capable of producing one
million tons of crude oil there.

<HEADLINE> Government-Subsidized Housing For North China City </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TIANJIN, February 21 (Xinhua) -- More citizens of Tianjin are
making their dream of owning their own home come true by shelling
out cash, instead of waiting for government-subsidized flats with
their low rents to become available.
</P>
<P>
About 40,000 households in this northern Chinese coastal city
purchased 2.01 million square meters of government-subsidized
apartments in 1996, increases of 60 percent and 90 percent
respectively over 1995.
</P>
<P>
Local officials attribute the development to the city's efforts
to commercialize housing. While avoiding increasing rental rates,
the city has drafted preferential policies and provided mortgages
for public housing to encourage residents to buy, and many
residents have turned to purchasing their own house as a new form
of investment.
</P>
<P>
Recent reports say that the annual average salary of Tianjin
employees has gone from 3,118 yuan (389 U.S. dollars) in 1992 to
7,500 yuan (937 dollars) last year.

<HEADLINE> Guangdong to Continue Steady Economic Progress This Year </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, February 21 (Xinhua) -- South China's Guangdong
Province will maintain its steady economic progress this year,
"China Daily" quoted Guangdong Governor Lu Ruihua as saying.
</P>
<P>
Addressing the local legislature, Lu estimated that the local
gross domestic product would increase ten percent this year. Total
GDP volume was 609.7 billion yuan (73.46 billion US dollars) last
year, up 11 percent from 1995.
</P>
<P>
In a report on government work, Lu said the inflation rate has
been at 4.4 percent, much lower than the ten percent targeted last
year.
</P>
<P>
Macro-control strategy has operated efficiently. The total
fixed asset investment increase was held at five percent to 244.3
billion yuan.
</P>
<P>
Industrial production volume increased by 18 percent, with
large enterprise groups taking up 40 percent of the total gross
output and 80 percent of the profits.
</P>
<P>
Import and export volume reached 110 billion US dollars, with
59 billion US dollars for export.
</P>
<P>
A better investment environment and a more equal treatment
policy between domestic firms and overseas-funded firms have
helped boost the use of overseas funds. Actual use of overseas
investment reached 13.9 billion US dollars, a 15 percent increase
from 1995.
</P>
<P>
However, Lu pointed out some problems such as the decreasing
enterprise profit level, stockpiles, deficits, bad loans and
unreasonable economic fix.
</P>
<P>
Upon Hong Kong's return to the motherland in July, the governor
called for the province to seize the chance to advance jointly
with Hong Kong in trading, finance, technology and education areas.
</P>
<P>
Guangdong should take the opportunity to attract more capital
from Hong Kong and Macao and upgrade export products and further
develop a sound export processing system.
</P>
<P>
Export companies are encouraged to unite to set up
conglomerates to be more competitive.
</P>
<P>
Electronics, information technology, light industry and
textile, petro-chemicals and machinery are key areas to be
supported by the government.
</P>
<P>
Agricultural development and economic structure reform will be
placed at the top of the government's working agenda this year.
</P>
<P>
Lu emphasized the protection of arable land and affirmed that
grain growing areas should be no less than 33.3 million ha and
annual output at about 19 million tons.

<HEADLINE> Donors to Review Reform's Progress in Bangladesh </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DHAKA, February 21 (Xinhua) -- Representatives of 30 donor
organizations, such as the World Bank and Asian Development Bank,
will hold a mid-term review of aid utilization by the Bangladeshi
government on February 25, according to Finance Ministry sources.
</P>
<P>
The review meeting, to be held in Dhaka, will mainly focus on
four important areas including the banking and financial sector,
privatization, poverty alleviation and water resource management,
the sources said.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the whole gamut of the reform agenda, which the
government is expected to implement in the light of the
understanding reached at the Paris consortium meeting last
September, would come up for review.
</P>
<P>
Following the Ganges water-sharing agreement with India, the
water resource development will be given priority because of its
crucial role in changing human life style, said the sources,
adding that the upcoming two-day meeting would devote a whole
working session to the issue.
</P>
<P>
It is the first time that such a donor's meeting is taking
place in the capital city of Bangladesh, who receives about 2
billion US dollars of foreign aid every year.

<HEADLINE> World Bank Optimistic About China's Agriculture </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, February 21 (Xinhua) -- The World Bank is optimistic
about China's agriculture, according to Pieter Bottelier, chief of
the bank's China resident mission, "China Daily" reported today.
</P>
<P>
The country has great potential in grain production, which can
be developed through increasing crop land yield, applying advanced
technology and reducing grain losses, the official said.
</P>
<P>
Official statistics indicate that more than 60 percent of
China's 100 million ha of crop land produce low yields. The
average production is equal to 60 percent of that in countries
with advanced agriculture.
</P>
<P>
Experts said that spending an average 2,600 yuan (316 US
dollars) per ha of low-yield land would help raise grain output by
45 million tons, which is about four times the country's grain
imports last year.
</P>
<P>
Only 35 percent of the grain production growth is due to the
introduction of new technology. This leaves big room for growth
because the figure in countries with advanced agriculture is 60
percent.
</P>
<P>
The Ministry of Agriculture wants to improve technology's
contribution rate to 50 percent by 2000.
</P>
<P>
The government also has taken measures to expand its farmland
acreage by cultivating barren land and reclaiming wasteland.
</P>
<P>
After declining 267,000 ha from 1986 to the early 1990s, crop
land is recovering by increasing more than 130,000 ha annually.
</P>
<P>
Opportunities also lie in cutting back on grain losses from
poor storage and transportation conditions which have resulted in
losing more than ten percent of the total grain output, experts
said.
</P>
<P>
More than 20 million tons will be saved if the country reduces
the loss rate to the international average level of five percent,
they said. China produced 48 million tons of grain in 1996.
</P>
<P>
Although the country imports more than ten million tons of
grain annually, it also exports some grain and a large quantity of
other agricultural products, noted Bottelier.
</P>
<P>
In fact, China last year achieved a surplus in its foreign
trade of agricultural products, according to official
statistics.

WELLINGTON, February 21 (Xinhua) -- The New Zealand sharemarket
ended the week on a disappointing note with market index falling 1
percent. The market was affected by overnight fall on Wall Street
and higher local bond yields.
</P>
<P>
The NZSE-40 index ended 24 points lower at 2302 with a turnover

the United States for creating tensions among the former Soviet
Union Republics.
</P>
<P>
Rodionov told a news conference that some hostile powers from

and this was threatening security in the Commonwealth of
Independent States.
</P>
<P>
He said a planned military exercises between the North Atlantic
Treaty Organization forces and Ukraine, which included a landing

Russian government as not friendly.
</P>
<P>
The Russian defense minister pointed out that the involvement
in Afghanistan affairs by the U.S. and other powers was further
deteriorating Russia's southern border area.
</P>
<P>
Russia would not be indifferent to the fact that its state
security was being endangered, Rodionov said.

<P>
He said Russia was to send a delegation to Uzbekstan, one of

<HEADLINE> State-owned Farms Go under Contract System </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, February 21 (Xinhua) -- State-owned farms previously
called People's Liberation Army reclamation farms across the
country's remote areas will allow individual households to
contract their farmland for agricultural production this year.
</P>
<P>
Today's "China Daily" quoted officials with the Ministry of
Agriculture as saying that introducing a household contract
responsibility system to the state farms is part of a reform to
tap the potential of their employee's enthusiasm for production.
</P>
<P>
These state farms have an agricultural administrative system
similar to the former People's Communes.
</P>
<P>
They lease land to private businesses and contract farmland to
their employees to make everyone involved responsible for their
own profits and losses.
</P>
<P>
With 4.53 million ha of arable land, state farms have become
the country's leading producer of cotton, natural rubber, milk and
soy beans.
</P>
<P>
Last year, the farms produced more than 15 million tons of
grain and soy beans, up 21 percent from 1995.
</P>
<P>
In 1996, they also yielded 538,200 tons of cotton, 7.8 million
tons of sugar crops, 700,000 tons of meat, 380,000 tons of aquatic
products and 1.06 million tons of cow milk.
</P>
<P>
Tapping the potential of agricultural production of state farms
not only requires the enthusiasm of individuals but also needs
advanced agro-technology and farm machinery.
</P>
<P>
By the end of last year state farms had 10.22 million kw in
combined power of farm machinery to modernize their agricultural
production. This enabled them to use farm equipment on 79 percent
of their crop-sowing areas.

<TEXT>
<P>
WELLINGTON, February 21 (Xinhua) -- New Zealand Prime Minister
Jim Bolger has praised Deng Xiaoping as an architect of modern
China and a leader at the center of Chinese politics for more than
half a century.
</P>
<P>
In a media release issued after the death of Deng on Thursday,
Bolger said that Deng would be remembered first of all for the
role he had played in China's economic reform process. He
spearheaded China's opening to the outside world, and the
market-oriented policies that have since 1978 delivered China a
year-on-year growth rate of over 9 percent.
</P>
<P>
The release, available today, said New Zealand has benefited
from the success and stability of those policies. "And the whole
world is better off because China is engaged internationally, and
set to continue along the path. We have Deng to thank for that."
</P>
<P>
It continued that "to have achieved the advances he did, in a
country of 1.2 billion people, is a remarkable feat by anyone's
standards. Deng has laid a solid platform for the succeeding
generation of Chinese leadership to build upon."
</P>
<P>
Bolger expressed the deep sympathy of the NZ government and
people to the government and people of China in the loss of a
pre-eminent statesman and leader.

<HEADLINE> Number Of Chain Stores Growing In Shanghai </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHANGHAI, February 21 (Xinhua) -- The chain store business is
expanding steadily in this east China metropolis, with more than
2,000 in operation now and plans for 1000 chain supermarkets by
the year 2,000.
</P>
<P>
Sales of the chain-store business, which is a focal point in
Shanghai's retail sales development plan, are expected to reach 16
billion yuan by then, accounting for ten percent of total sales.
</P>
<P>
Supermarket growth is the most notable of all stores, said Hong
Guankang, vice director and general secretary of the Shanghai
Chain-Business Association.
</P>
<P>
Nearly 800 supermarkets have opened since 1991. In 1996,
supermarket sales were more than four billion yuan, accounting for
about three percent of the city's retail sales, compared with 2.3
billion yuan and 2.4 percent in 1995, said Hong.
</P>
<P>
He said the city has about 700 convenience stores, 70
restaurant franchises, 100 clothing-chain stores, and laundry,
household appliance repair, and photo service chains.
</P>
<P>
Hong predicts that business will expand to include medicines,
capital goods, hotels, and travel services. With their
increasingly popularity because of availability and low prices,
more local enterprises intend to join in.
</P>
<P>
Some businesses are going nationwide. The Shanghai No. 1
Department Store Co. Ltd. has opened outlets in the cities of
Changchun, Chongqing, Hefei, Xi'an, and Taiyuan.

MOSCOW, February 21 (Xinhua) -- Russian and Eastern European

leader Deng Xiaoping and praised him for his great contributions
to China's opening-up and reform process.

<P>
Russian President Boris Yeltsin sent a letter of condolences to
his Chinese counterpart Jiang Zemin, describing Deng, who died
late on Wednesday at the age of 93, as "an outstanding statesman."
</P>
<P>
Deng was the architect of China's reforms which have brought
historic changes to the country, Yeltsin said.
</P>
<P>
Russia's State Duma (lower house of parliament) observed a
minute's silence to mourn Deng when it convened on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
State Duma Chairman Gennady Seleznev said Deng's death will not
lead to a change in China's economic policy, adding that "the
Chinese leaders will stick to the policy with full confidence."
</P>
<P>
Uzbek President Islam Karimov and Lithuanian President Algirdas
Brazauskas, currently visiting Uzbekistan, both expressed sorrow
over Deng's death at a joint press conference on Thursday.

Karimov described Deng as "one of the greatest leaders of the
world in the 20th century", "the general architect and helmsman of
China's economic reforms."
</P>
<P>
He said, "Deng drafted China's reform and opening-up policies,
under which the country has gained splendid achievements in
economic development.
</P>
<P>
"It was a great contribution of Deng to enable 1.2 billion
Chinese people to be well-fed and well-clothed."

Brazauskas said Deng was a great and intelligent statesman, and
that it was worthwhile to learn from Deng's model of economic
reform and his successful experience in establishing special
economic zones.

<P>
Ukrainian President Leonid Kuchma, in a telegram sent to Jiang
Zemin on Thursday, hailed Deng as "an outstanding politician of the

Yugoslav President Zoran Lilic said in his telegram of

him work of lasting value, in launching reforms in Chinese
society, in constructing a model of socialism with Chinese
characteristics, and in creating conditions for the country's
unification with the concept of "one country, two systems."
</P>

<P>
MOSCOW, February 20 (Xinhua) -- Russia's Prime Minister Viktor
Chernomyrdin and Foreign Minister Yevgeny Primakov held talks
today with U.S. Secretary of State Madeleine Albright on
bilateral ties and NATO's eastward expansion.
</P>
<P>
Chernomyrdin told Albright that economic cooperation between
the two countries is much more active than political links,
Itar-Tass news agency reported.
</P>
<P>
The agency gave no further details, but Albright reportedly
outlined proposals for a charter to link Russia to NATO and for
further cutting the arms ceilings imposed under the 1990
Conventional Forces in Europe treaty on tanks and other weaponry
deployed in Europe.
</P>
<P>
Both sides also exchanged views on preparations for a
Russian-U.S. summit in Helsinki next month, she said.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Albright's spokesman, Nicholas Burns, described the
meetings as "very constructive and very detailed", saying the
meetings took place in a "warm atmosphere".
</P>
<P>
However, Russian officials repeatedly said before Albright
arrived that they remained implacably opposed to NATO's
enlargement, which they regard as a threat to Russian security.
</P>
<P>
Russian President Boris Yeltsin is scheduled meet Albright on
Friday.
</P>
<P>
Albright arrived here this afternoon for a two-day visit,
aimed at softening Russia's opposition to NATO's expansion.
</P>
<P>
Moscow is the sixth stop in Albright's nine-country tour to
Europe and Asia, which has so far taken her to Italy, Germany,
France, Britain and the NATO headquarters in Brussels, Belgium.

<HEADLINE> Central China Factories With Pollution Problems Moved </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WUHAN, February 21 (Xinhua) -- Eighteen factories in Yichang,
which is along the middle reaches of the Yangtze River, have been
moved out of the city proper or have stopped production in a move
to remove the clouds of smoke that darken the city's sky.
</P>
<P>
Another 48 factories with big pollution problems will also be
moved to Yichang's outskirts soon and technological improvements
will be made before they can move to Yichang's rural areas.
</P>
<P>
Xiling Gorge in Yichang, in central China's Hubei Province, is
one of the Three Gorges, and a well known tourist spot, with
several million tourist arrivals every year.
</P>
<P>
However, the soot discharged by some factories has seriously
damaged the city's image. So, the city government decided to move
66 factories, valued at 740 million yuan (92 million
U.S. dollars), to the outskirts.
</P>
<P>
The move will cost 2.19 billion yuan (267 million dollars).
</P>
<P>
A pottery factory moved from the downtown area to a suburban
area and replaced the heavy oil it uses with light diesel oil,
putting an end to the black smoke in its rebuilt factory.
</P>
<P>
The city government has drafted preferential policies to
encourage factories with pollution problems to move out of the
urban area and has established an industrial park in a suburban
area for the purpose.

<HEADLINE> UN Chief Calls for Cooperation on Liberia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, February 20 (Xinhua) -- United Nations
Secretary-General Kofi Annan on Thursday called for intensified
international cooperation as the world embarked on a new and final
phase of the peace process in Liberia.
</P>
<P>
In a speech to the Second Ministerial Meeting of the Special
Conference to Support the Peace Process in Liberia, Annan said it
was no secret what needed to be done by the international
community if the peace processes in Liberia were to have the best
chance of succeeding.
</P>
<P>
Among the tasks he listed were the provision of more troops
and resources to the peace-keeping force of the Economic Community
of Western Africa, encouraging demobilized fighters to return to
civil society and reactivating basic institutions of government
and society.
</P>
<P>
He said all the tasks could be completed. He urged participants
of the meeting to pay more attention to the unification of the
international community in promoting peace process in Liberia.
</P>
<P>
"In the past, the failure of the principal external actors to
maintain a common political approach to the Liberian crisis
undoubtedly impeded political progress towards a solution," he
said.
</P>
<P>
Today, by contrast, a positive trend in the peace process owed
much to efforts to bring greater political cohesion to the main
groups involved.
</P>
<P>
"This cooperation must now be intensified as we embark on a new
final phase of the peace process in Liberia," he said. "We must
all be committed to a common approach, as well as to a common
strategy for implementation."

<HEADLINE> Beijing to Expand Infrastructure Construction </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, February 21 (Xinhua) -- Beijing will spend more on
building up its infrastructure in a move to achieve its goal of
becoming a modernized international city, the city's acting mayor
Jia Qinglin said here Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Addressing the ongoing fifth session of the city's Tenth
People's Congress, Jia said that about 100 billion yuan (about 12
billion US dollars) of funds will be needed to support the
infrastructure programs for the 1996-2000 period.
</P>
<P>
These include a group of key projects involving construction of
systems for water, electricity, heat and roads,
telecommunications, ports and environmental protection. They are
expected to help increase the city's daily water supply to 600,000
cubic meters, and the electricity generating capacity to seven
million kilowatts.
</P>
<P>
By the end of September, the city will begin transporting
natural gas from Shaanxi and Gansu provinces and Ningxia Hui
Autonomous Region, build 11 kilometers of new subway lines, and
increase the number of telephone lines to five million, which
means that 55 percent of urban families will have telephones.
</P>
<P>
Beijing will continue to introduce foreign funds into the
infrastructure improvement plan and the renovation of rundown
houses, Jia noted, adding that it will also update the system used
for buying houses and increase the mortgage loans for individual
housing purchases, Jia noted.
</P>
<P>
The city will build eight million square meters of new housing,
renovate 1.1 million square meters of dilapidated houses and
complete 600,000 square meters of "comfortable housing" for
households with low incomes, he said.
</P>
<P>
He recalled the progress made in the infrastructure upgrading
in 1996, stressing that the future construction should be
well-guided by comprehensive city planning.
</P>
<P>
During the past year, the 30-kilometer expressway connecting
Beijing and Changping went into operation, the renovation work of
some major streets was completed, and the two major electricity
generators in the Shisanling Power Station were built, Jia said.
</P>
<P>
The city's electricity generating capacity increased by more
than 400,000 kilowatts, and the number of gas users went up by
8,700 last year, Jia said.

<HEADLINE> Colombia Steps up Fight Against Drug Trafficking </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SANTA FE DE BOGOTA, February 20 (Xinhua) -- Colombia and the
United States signed an agreement today which opens the way for
them to intercept suspected drug-running boats beyond the 12-mile
coastal limit.
</P>
<P>
The agreement was signed by Colombian Foreign Minister Maria
Emma Mejia Velez and U.S. Ambassador to Colombia Myles Frechette.
</P>
<P>
The agreement comes in the wake of new laws allowing the
expropriation of money made from drug trafficking and the more
than doubling of maximum jail terms for traffickers from 24 to
60 years.
</P>
<P>
Officials hope these two measures will help Colombia win back
"certification" from the U.S., naming it an ally in the
international war against drugs and thus eliminating the threat of
sanctions.
</P>
<P>
U.S. President Bill Clinton is due to decide on February 27
whether or not to certify Colombia.
</P>
<P>
Last year Colombia lost its certification as the U.S. didn't
believe it was doing enough to fight the drug war, and suffered
sanctions such as a cut in military assistance and vetos on loans
from international banks where the United States has influence.
</P>
<P>
Frechette said the signing of the treaty and the new
legislation will be put on the scales when the certification
decision is made.
</P>
<P>
The United States has long complained about the prison terms
for convicted drug traffickers in Colombia.
</P>
<P>
It protested vigorosly that the sentences meted out to the
leaders of the Cali drug cartel in January were too lenient.
Gilberto and Miguel Rodriguez Orejuela were jailed for nine and
10.5 years respectively.
</P>
<P>
If they had been sentenced under the new legislation,
they would be facing between 45 and 60 years in prison.

<HEADLINE> East China Emphasizing Economic Efficiency For Foreign Trade </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HANGZHOU, February 21 (Xinhua) -- East China's Zhejiang
Province will make economic efficiency the central task for
developing foreign trade and economic cooperation this year.
</P>
<P>
In an interview with reporters, Yang Zucheng, director of the
Zhejiang Provincial Department of Foreign Trade and Economic
Cooperation, said that the province will make an effort to shift
from the practice of solely pursuing export and earnings quotas to
making efficiency as the central task of foreign trade.
</P>
<P>
Zhejiang will also strive to deal with the relations between
fairly large-scale and efficient management, to ensure continuous
development of foreign trade, and economic cooperation.
</P>
<P>
While improving understanding of this and trying to cultivate
100 major export commodities to adjust the province's economic,
especially the export, structure, the province will also work
harder to explore new overseas markets in addition to its
traditional markets.
</P>
<P>
The director also called for an emphasis on quality in the use
of overseas investment. Last year, the province did 13.386 billion
U.S. dollars worth of foreign trade, a rise of 16.1 percent over
the previous year. Of that amount, exports made up 9.334 billion
U.S. dollars, up 10.5 percent over the previous year.

MANILA, February 21 (Xinhua) -- A fire razed a house at dawn
today in the eastern Manila suburbs, killing a Chinese-Filipino
couple and their three daughters, police said.
</P>
<P>
Police said Victor Tan, his wife Lydia and their kids were all
sleeping when trapped by the blaze inside their residence at
Makiling Street, Mandaluyong City.
</P>
<P>
Police said they suspected a foul play because the Tan's house
boy, who survived the conflagration, was outside the house when
the fire broke out.
</P>
<P>
But the house boy, Loreto Tatoy, alleged that he was drinking
beer inside a pub house, a few blocks away from Tan's house, when
the fire broke out.

<TEXT>
<P>
KIEV, February 20 (Xinhua) -- Ukrainian Security Secretary
Vladimir Gorbulin has said that his country supports NATO's
efforts to build closer ties with Russia.
</P>
<P>
During a meeting with U.S. congressman Gerald Solomon on
Wednesday, Gorbulin said NATO and Moscow should set up a mechanism
for regular consultation, Interfax news agency reported.
</P>
<P>
Solomon, heading a delegation of U.S. congressmen, arrived here
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Gorbulin said Ukraine backs a U.S. proposal to establish a
"Russia-NATO military structure," and believes joint military
maneuvers would build up confidence between the two sides.
</P>
<P>
"There will be no security in Europe without considering
Russia," he said.
</P>
<P>
Russia has strongly opposed plans by NATO to expand eastward to
take in countries from the now defunct Warsaw Pact, saying the
move would threaten its security.
</P>
<P>
To try to ease Russian fears, the U.S. has proposed the
creation of a joint NATO-Russian military brigade, mainly for
peacekeeping and has also offered a charter defining NATO-Russian
relations.
</P>
<P>
Russia has demanded a legally binding contract providing
security guarantees for Russia in the event of NATO's expansion.
</P>
<P>
Gorbulin announced that Ukraine hoped to sign a special
partnership agreement with NATO which he believed would provide
his country with security.
</P>
<P>
Ukraine has said in the past that it will not join the Western
military alliance and will keep its status as a non-aligned
country.

<HEADLINE> World's Biggest Orchid Plantation Built in Sichuan </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Chengdu, February 21 (Xinhua) -- The world's largest orchid
nursery, designed to grow and protect the endangered Chinese
orchid, has been built in Pixian County in southwest China's
Sichuan Province.
</P>
<P>
Runde Orchid Park, with 10 million seedlings and covering an
area of more than 130 hectares, will become a large export center
of the rare flower.
</P>
<P>
With help from the Sichuan United University, the park has
carried out natural orchid production in large amounts. Scientists
from the university will also help build an orchid gene bank and
an orchid study center in the park.
</P>
<P>
Regarded by the Chinese as a symbol of virginity and nobility,
the sweet-smelling blossom has been grown in China for over 2000
years.
</P>
<P>
Chinese orchids are expensive; most are planted in small
numbers in family gardens, seldom entering the domestic and
overseas flower markets.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese orchid has large market potential in the world,
especially in Japan, the Republic of Korea and southeast
Asian countries, where the Chinese culture is prevalent.
</P>
<P>
Experts say that the smuggling of Chinese orchids by some
foreigners has resulted in the loss of a large number of wild
orchids, and in some areas, known as homes for the flower, their
number is also shrinking.

BEIJING, February 21 (Xinhua) -- All major Beijing-based
newspapers today mourned Comrade Deng Xiaoping who passed away
Wednesday night and carried Deng family's letter to Chinese
president Jiang Zemin and the Central Committee of the Communist
Party of China (CPC).
</P>
<P>
Various departments and institutions directly under the CPC
Central Committee yesterday eulogized Deng by reviewing his
glorious revolutionary career and great contributions to the
country, while all officials and employees of the central
government departments pledged to inherit Deng's legacy by
continuing to build socialism with Chinese characteristics and
performing their duties more conscientiously, the papers report.
</P>
<P>
Legislators attending a meeting of the Eighth Standing
Committee of the National People's Congress (NPC), which opened
yesterday in Beijing, observed three minutes of silence before
beginning their discussions.
</P>
<P>
Staff workers of the NPC also convened a meeting to mourn Deng,
and said they will work diligently to prepare for the upcoming
Fifth Session of the Eighth NPC National Congress, which is
scheduled on March 1, according to the papers.
</P>
<P>
To illustrate Deng Xiaoping's lifelong pursuits and beliefs and
to perfectly close the last chapter of his life, Zhuo Lin, widow
of Deng, and their five children proposed in a letter to President
Jiang Zemin and the CPC Central Committee that no farewell
ceremony for Deng's remains be held and no ashes preserved. Deng's
ashes will be cast into the sea according to Deng's wish.
</P>
<P>
Zhuo and her children suggested that a memorial meeting be held
after the cremation. The casket containing Deng's ashes should be
covered by a flag of the CPC, with a color photo that displays
Deng's superb mental outlook above it.
</P>
<P>
Deng's corneas will be donated to an eyebank and his body be
dissected for the purpose of medical research, prior to the
cremation.
</P>
<P>
A picture of half-mast national flag at the Tiananmen Square
was also front paged by some major newspapers, including Guangming
Daily, Workers' Daily, and the Economic Daily.
</P>
<P>
On the international pages, major Beijing-based newspapers
carried condolences over Deng's death extended by top leaders of
the United Nations, the European Union, Russia, the United States,
Canada, France, India, Cuba, the Democratic People's Republic of
Korea, Viet Nam, the Republic of Korea, Germany, Japan, Spain, and
Australia.

<HEADLINE> China's Nature Reserves To Be Doubled </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, February 21 (Xinhua) -- The number of China's nature
reserves will be doubled to some 1,000 by around the year 2010,
according to the country's Vice-Minister of Forestry Wang Zhibao.
</P>
<P>
By then, there will be 100 national-level nature reserves,
around 40 percent more than at present, Wang said in an interview
with Xinhua News Agency.
</P>
<P>
"Starting from the 1950s, the establishment of China's nature
reserves has won much attention from the world, and a countrywide
network of the reserves has been formed," he said.
</P>
<P>
Such reserves throughout the country play an important role in
the protection of biological diversity, endangered species, and
the natural ecosystems in both China and the world, Wang stressed.
</P>
<P>
"The reserves of all kinds of forestry, wetlands and desert
ecosystems as well as the wildlife are important national
treasures that should be cherished forever," he said.
</P>
<P>
He noted that the establishment of natural reserves has
contributed significantly to the protection of the giant panda.
</P>
<P>
"At the beginning of the next century, the reserves for the
giant panda will be exactly doubled to 28, basically covering the
whole area of its habitat," he said.

<HEADLINE> Colombia, U.S. to Combat Maritime Drug Trafficking </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SANTA FE DE BOGOTA, February 20 (Xinhua) -- Colombia and the
United States signed an agreement today which opens the way for
them to intercept suspected drug-running boats beyond the 12-mile
coastal limit.
</P>
<P>
The agreement was signed by Colombian Foreign Minister Maria
Emma Mejia Velez and U.S. Ambassador to Colombia Myles Frechette.
</P>
<P>
The agreement and the laws that permit to expropriate the
fortunes of the drug traffickers and condemn them to 60 years in
prison are compatible with the Vienna Convention commitments
against international drug trafficking, Mejia said.
</P>
<P>
Political and congressional leaders said the legislative
measures and the naval agreement are a Colombian effort to obtain
from the United States the annual certification of support to the
international war against drugs.
</P>
<P>
Last year Colombia was not certified and suffered some
sanctions such as a cut in military assistance and vetos to loans
from international banks, in which the United States has a
major participation.
</P>
<P>
Frechette said the signing of the treaty and the law that
increases the penalties will be put on the scales at the moment of
taking the decision and granting or denying the certification.
</P>
<P>
The international community received with respect and elation
the Colombian decision to increase penalties for drug trafficking
kingpins.
</P>
<P>
The United States had protested the leniency shown in the
nine-year and 10.5-year jail terms dictated recently to the
Gilberto and Miguel Rodriguez Orejuela brothers, confessed leaders
of the Cali cartel.
</P>
<P>
If they had been sentenced according to the new legislation,
they would have been sentenced to a 60-year maximum or a minimum
of 45 years in jail.

<HEADLINE> Mexico To Repay IMF $600 Million in Advance </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MEXICO CITY, February 20 (Xinhua) -- The Mexican government
will make a 600 million U.S, dollar advance repayment on former
loans to the International Monetary Fund (IMF) before the end of
this month.
</P>
<P>
The repayment was announced today by the Finance and Public
Credit Ministry (SHCP).
</P>
<P>
Finance authorities said the prepayment was made possible by
the reception of 1.18 billion dollars resulting from Federal
Government bonds sales in German marks and Italian lire during
February 20 and 24.
</P>
<P>
The bonds issued on the German market add up to 1.5 million
marks (about 880 million dollars), and 5 billion lire in Italy
(300 million dollars).
</P>
<P>
The Mexican bond issues in these markets have 12-year and
10-year maturities, respectively.
</P>
<P>
The SHCP said 50 percent of the resources obtained would be
used for the prepayment to the IMF, and the other half would be
channeled to international reserves, which reached 18.5 billion
dollars in recent days.

<HEADLINE> US Says No Cooperation With WTO on Row With EU on Cuba </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, February 20 (Xinhua) -- The U.S. said today that it
would not cooperate with the World Trade Organization (WTO) on
investigating the U.S.-EU dispute over Cuba, claiming the WTO is
not fit to referee such a row.
</P>
<P>
In a statement, U.S. Undersecretary of Commerce Stuart
Eizenstat expressed disappointment at the WTO's intervention into
its dispute with the European Union (EU) over sanctions against
Cuba.
</P>
<P>
The WTO announced earlier today that a dispute panel, made up
of three trade experts, was established to settle the disputes
between the U.S. and the EU. The panel is obliged to make a rule
within six months.
</P>
<P>
AT the center of the row is the U.S. Helms-Burton law, which
was enacted last year and aimed at curbing foreign investment in
Cuba. The EU argues it violates WTO principles.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. law has been under strong criticism worldwide since it
punishes not only the U.S. companys which trade with Cuba, but
also other countries.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. and the EU had been in discussions, hoping to resolve
their differences before the WTO sets up a panel. The
establishment of the panel is automatic after their bilateral
direct talks failed to produce a settlement.
</P>
<P>
"The WTO is not an appropriate forum for resolving differences
over what is essentially a disagreement over foreign policy,"
Eizenstat affirmed.
</P>
<P>
"The United States wishes to provide every opportunity to
settle our differences with the EU in the dispute," added
Eizenstat.
</P>
<P>
But the official stressed that if no prompt agreement was
reached, the U.S. would tell the WTO that the organization's panel
has "no competence to proceed because it is a matter of U.S.
national security and foreign policy."
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the EU also indicated that it remained its aim to
achieve a negotiated settlement through more bilateral discussions
despite the establishment of the WTO's panel.

<HEADLINE> Irish Company Develops Mad Cow Detection System </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, February 20 (Xinhua) -- An Irish research company
announced in Dublin today that it has developed a new diagnostic
system, which can be used to detect mad cow disease, according to
press reports from Dublin.
</P>
<P>
Enfer Scientific Ltd said in a statement issued today that the
new detection system could be used to screen 1,000 beef carcasses
each day.
</P>
<P>
"The application of this technology can be expected to provide
a new public confidence amongst beef consumers and it will install
their detection system in any country or market," the statement
said.
</P>
<P>
Michael O'Connor, the company's technical director, said, "The
real significance of the test is that it can test a large number
of carcasses and get the results back before the meat enters the
human food chain."
</P>
<P>
Medical experts say that the current tests were based on actual
examination of brain tissue under a microscope.

NEW YORK, February 20 (Xinhua) -- The New York stock market

a weaker dollar and lower bond prices.

The Dow Jones industrial average lost 92.75 points today to

short-term setback.

The dollar fell sharply against the Japanese yen today, hurting

<HEADLINE> US to Discuss Security Issues With Saudis </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, February 20 (Xinhua) -- The United States will
discuss security issues with Saudi Arabia's Prince Sultan when he
visits Washington next week, the Pentagon said today.
</P>
<P>
Prince Sultan is coming "as an emissary of King Fahd in his
capacity as deputy prime minister, and he will meet with a range
of people while he's here," Pentagon spokesman Ken Bacon told
reporters at a briefing.
</P>
<P>
U.S. troops stationed in Saudi Arabia have been threatened with
various kinds of attacks since their presence there after the Gulf
War in 1991. On June 25 last year, 19 American servicemen were
killed when a truck bomb exploded at their Khobar Tower housing
facilities at a military air base in Dhahran.
</P>
<P>
The United States has henceforth moved its troops there to a
far remote air base less vulnerable to attacks, and taken even
more tightened security measures to protect its servicemen's life.
</P>
<P>
Prince Sultan will discuss with Defense Secretary William Cohen
"our program to improve the security of the U.S. military people
serving in Saudi Arabia to protect our interests in the Middle
East," Bacon said.
</P>
<P>
He said investigations into the June 25 bomb attack would be on
the agenda when they hold talks.
</P>
<P>
The United States has repeatedly expressed its frustration over
the slow pace of Saudis' probe into the bomb attack with the FBI
chief and the justice secretary coming out to make public
criticism, complaining Saudis' lack of cooperation in the
investigations.

<HEADLINE> Canadian Plane Maker Lands More Jet Orders </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
OTTAWA, February 20 (Xinhua) -- Canada's Bombardier Inc. has
lined up 1.5 billion U.S. dollars in likely orders for its stretch
version of Canadair Regional Jet, said reports today.
</P>
<P>
France's Brit Air will become the first to fly the new Canadair
jet, which is to be formally known as the CRJ-700.
</P>
<P>
The French regional carrier has placed firm orders for four
70-seat CRJ-700 and taken out an option on two more. It is
scheduled to take delivery of the first plane in the year of 2000.
</P>
<P>
Seven other buyers on four continents have put down payments on
a further 61 planes, leaving the company with a total of 67 firm
orders, options and memorandums of understanding, the reports
said.
</P>
<P>
The CRJ-700 jet is priced at 23 million dollars and has entered
the final stages of design, according to Bombardier Inc., Canada's
largest transportation conglomerate.
</P>
<P>
The new plane is intended to appeal to airlines that are trying
to reduce fleet costs by matching the size of their aircraft to
consumer demand.
</P>
<P>
"We forecast a requirement for about 2,000 regional jet
aircraft in the 20- to 90-seat market by the year 2015," said
Pierre Lortie, president of the Bombardier Regional Aircraft
Division.
</P>
<P>
"Bombardier's share of the jet portion of this market -- 53
percent in calendar 1996 year alone -- will be further reinforced
by the Canadair Regional Jet Series 700," he noted.

<HEADLINE> Nile Basin Countries Discuss Water Issues in Cairo </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, February 20 (Xinhua) -- Nile Basin countries opened a
meeting here today to discuss projects to develop the rich
resources of the world's second longest river.
</P>
<P>
When inaugurating the fifth meeting of the Nile Basin
countries, Egyptian Deputy Premier and Minister of Agriculture
Youssef Wali, said that water resources of the Nile River are not
fully exploited.
</P>
<P>
Egypt has proposed the "Techno-Nile" gathering as a technical
arrangement for laying down an integrated framework of action in
the interests of the Nile Basin countries, he added.
</P>
<P>
The three-day meeting of nine water resources ministers will
discuss the plan of action agreed in previous meeting in Tanzania
in 1995.
</P>
<P>
The Egyptian MENA news agency quoted Egyptian Nile Water
Authority Chairman Mohamed Nasser as saying that the plan included
22 long-range development projects for the Nile water resources
and environment protection with investment totaling 100 million
U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
Nasser said the meeting will be followed by a conference in
Addis Ababa, Ethiopia, on February 23-28 to discuss the research
work in the best way to develop the Nile resources.
</P>
<P>
Flowing into Egypt, the 6,700-kilometer-long Nile fans out a
fertile valley of 24,000 square kilometers which accounts for
two-thirds of the Egyptian arable land and attracts 96 percent of
the population.
</P>
<P>
Under the 1959 agreement on the quota share between Egypt and
Sudan, Egypt has access to 55.5 billion cubic meters of the Nile
water, which forms 99 percent of the country's sweet water
resources.
</P>
<P>
The Nile Basin groups Egypt, Sudan, Tanzania, Uganda, Rwanda,
Burundi, Kenya, Zaire and Ethiopia.

<HEADLINE> Major Urges Lockerbie Trial in Scotland Or US </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, February 20 (Xinhua) -- British Prime Minister John
Major said here today that two Libyans suspected of planting a
bomb in an American airline should be tried in Scotland or the
United States.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at the British parliament earlier today, Major said,
"I believe the trial should either be in Scotland, which is the
preference, or the United States."
</P>
<P>
The two Libyans have been indicted of blowing up Pan American
flight 103 over Lockerbie in Scotland, killing 259 people on board
and 11 others on the ground.
</P>
<P>
"We would like a solution as much as the relatives but we need
a proper criminal trial and there are genuine and practical
difficulties in trying to establish such a trial in a third
country," Major said.
</P>
<P>
It was reported that the Libyan government has suggested that
it would hand over the two men for trial in the Hague or any third
country, but London and Washington have rejected the offer.

<HEADLINE> Ghana's Economy Up 5.2 Percent in 1996 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, February 20 (Xinhua) -- Ghana recorded a 5.2 percent
economic growth in 1996, slightly higher than the projected five
percent increase for the year.
</P>
<P>
The country saw a four percent rise in agriculture, 4.2
percent hike in the industrial sector and 6.3 percent growth in
the service sector, Finance Minister Kwame Peprah quoted by a
report reaching here today as saying.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, inflation in the western African country dropped
from 70.8 percent at the end of 1995 to 32.6 percent in December
1996, Peprah told the newly-elected parliament on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The crops and livestock sub-sector grew by six percent and the
manufacturing sector rose by 3.3 percent last year, said Peprah,
adding mining and quarrying went up by 4.2 percent and
the construction sub-sector up by 6.1 percent in the period.
</P>
<P>
Higher growth rates were also observed in the forestry,
logging and fishing sub-sectors in 1996, he said.
</P>
<P>
However, Ghana's receipts last year stood at 2,268.5 Cedis
(1.29 billion Dollars) while expenditures came to 2,410.5 billion
Cedis (1.37 billion Dollars), according to the report.
</P>
<P>
The deficit, the minister said, is caused by "many
challenges" in managing the 1996 fiscal program. enditem

<HEADLINE> President: Cyprus Tries to Solve its Problem </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NICOSIA, February 20 (Xinhua) -- Cypriot President Glafcos
Clerides said today that the Greek Cypriot side is not seeking a
solution to the Cyprus problem through military confrontation.
</P>
<P>
The president was speaking at a gathering on "1997, a year
for Cyprus", which was held in Athens this evening, according to
the Cyprus News Agency.
</P>
<P>
"The first message I wish to send out in all directions,
including Turkey, is that we are not seeking a solution of the
Cyprus problem by military confrontation, but by effective
peaceful procedures," Clerides said.
</P>
<P>
He left here today for Athens to take part in the gathering.
</P>
<P>
He noted that his second message is that despite the
"irrevocable decision" to solve the problem through peaceful
means, "we shall continue with our defense program and acquire
the high technology weapons we consider necessary and which, as
an independent and sovereign country, we are entitled to acquire
for a more effective defense."
</P>
<P>
He said this policy will continue as long as there are Turkish
troops in Cyprus.
</P>
<P>
Referring to a joint defense pact between Cyprus and Greece,
President Clerides said "the moment Turkey withdraws its
occupation troops from Cyprus and the island is demilitarized,
there will be no need for the joint defense pact."
</P>
<P>
The government has an obligation to ensure the security of
its people and seek maximum protection of the sovereignty,
independence and territorial integrity of the Republic, he added.
</P>
<P>
"The time has come to make a more persistent and decisive
effort to achieve a solution of the Cyprus problem," he said.
</P>
<P>
He expressed his government's determination to work in this
direction with sincerity and an open mind with the U.N. and all
those who support their efforts.
</P>
<P>
President Clerides also expressed readiness for face-to-face
talks with Turkish Cypriot leader Rauf Denktash in 1997, "as
soon as the ground is properly prepared to ensure their
success."
</P>
<P>
However, he noted he is not prepared to begin another round
of fruitless talks as in the past.
</P>
<P>
Concluding his speech, the president said his government is
ready for a "sensible compromise" to reach a solution in Cyprus,
but warned that "if the Turkish forces try to impose a solution,
Cyprus will be more than ready to respond."
</P>
<P>
Cyprus has been divided since 1974 when Turkish troops
occupied the northern third of the island following a
short-lived coup seeking union with Greece.

<HEADLINE> US Rules out Quick Resumption of Syrian-Israli </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIRUT, February 20 (Xinhua) -- U.S. State Department
Spokesman Nicholas Burns ruled out today the quick resumption of
Israel's peace negotiations with Syria and Lebanon, which was
suspended one year ago.
</P>
<P>
In an interview with the Paris-based Orient Radio, which was
monitored in Beirut, Burns said Israeli Prime Minister Binyamin
Netanyahu briefed the U.S. leaders about Israeli positions on
its peace talks with Syria during his visit to Washington last
week.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. department spokesman told the Arabic-language radio
that Washington will make contacts with Damascus, but admitted
that it is difficult to bring the Syrian and Israeli negotiators
together at present.
</P>
<P>
"I don't expect movements soon," Burns said, "Prime Minister
Netanyahu gave us some ideas. We are going to be in communication
with the Syrian government."
</P>
<P>
"We want to see Syria and Israel to resume their
negotiations, I think it's hard to get them to do that," said
the U.S. official.
</P>
<P>
He reiterated that the resumption of the peace talks is in
the interest of Syria and Israel, adding that U.S. President
Bill Clinton has "very clear" views on this issue.
</P>
<P>
On the role played by France in the Middle East, Burns
underlined, "The United States has always welcomed a French
cooperation in the Middle East, and we continue to do so. France
has a long role, a historical role and a present role, and
France has good relations with many countries in the Middle
East."
</P>
<P>
The U.S. administration will concentrate its diplomacy
on the Middle East in the next month, the U.S. official said.
