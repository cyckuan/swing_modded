HONG KONG, September 20 (Xinhua) -- Russia upset Olympic silver
medalists China 3-1 to notch their second straight win at the
fourth and last leg of the World Women's Volleyball Grand Prix
preliminaries here on Friday.
</P>
<P>
Russia, powered by its 1.90-meter star spiker Elena Godina,
started the match well by winning the first set 15-8 but had to
rally from 2-6 behind to take the second set 15-9.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese came back strongly in the third set, where the two
squads tied at 12, 14, 15 and 16-16.
</P>
<P>
China saved the match point for five times before its spiker Wu
Yongmei successfully blocked a Godina attack to take the set
17-16.
</P>
<P>
But China could not keep their momentum going in the fourth set
and was helpless before the Russian high-point kills unleashed off
from Godina and Evguenia Artamonova.
</P>
<P>
Russian coach Nikolai Karpol said, "Every tactics we prepared
for the match worked well today. We noticed the Chinese were quite
tired."

<P>
But he said he did nothing special in defending against China's
top two players Sun Yue and Lai Yawen.
</P>
<P>
Chinese coach Lang Ping said, "We ran out of tricks today.
Russia played to its top form and even had a better defense than
China did."

She added that her team did not perform well on fast attacks
and reception was also poor, making counterattacks difficult.
</P>
<P>
In the other match, the United States defeated the Netherlands
15-8, 15-4, 14-16 and 15-10.
</P>
<P>
American coach Tarras Liskevych said, "Losing the third set was
critical (in winning the match). I could see my players played
better and better."

<P>
JOHANNESBURG, September 20 (Xinhua) -- The South African
government understood Rwanda's problems and it is willing and
able to help solve these problems, visiting Rwandan
Vice-President Paul Kagame said in South Africa today.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a press conference in Cape Town, Paul Kagame said
Rwanda is making ''tremendous progress'' in rebuilding its
diverse institutions in the wake of the 1994 genocide, reported
the South African Ppress Association.
</P>
<P>
Rwanda's problems have been compounded by the colonial
boundaries which divided communities across international
borders, said Kagame who is on a four-day visit to South Africa.

Answering questions about the work of the international war
crimes tribunals, Kagame expressed his disappointment at the
seeming inability of the war crimes tribunals.

<HEADLINE> Major Calls for EU Debate over Mad Cow Disease </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, September 20 (Xinhua) -- British Prime Minister John
Major has called on the European Union (EU) to have a "rational
debate" over the BSE or mad cow disease after the British
government announced a suspension of the slaughter program.
</P>
<P>
Speaking in a BBC television interview earlier today, Major
said that people should put aside their hysteria about beef and
made decisions based on scientific facts.
</P>
<P>
The Prime Minister insisted that the British government was
operating within rules agreed with the EU agriculture ministers by
choosing to stop the cattle cull.
</P>
<P>
The British government on Wednesday night decided to put on
hold the slaughter of the 147,000 cattle most at risk of BSE in
view of the new scientific findings that suggest the mad cow
disease would be over without the planned slaughter.
</P>
<P>
"I don't think anybody wishes to see a cull take place which is
unnecessary and economically wasteful. I would ask for a rational
debate and rational consideration," he added.
</P>
<P>
Major made it clear that suspension of the cull did not mean he
was tearing up a deal struck at an EU Summit in Florence in June
and he said, "It was perfectly clear within the Florence agreement
that if new evidence arose we had to consider that evidence."
</P>
<P>
The EU imposed the global ban on British beef products exports
on March 27 when the British government admitted that there were
possible links between mad cow disease and its human equivalent
Creutzfeldt Jacob Disease.
</P>
<P>
EU leaders agreed at the Florence Summit in June to gradually
lift the ban on British beef exports on the condition that Britain
should implement a series of tough measures, including the
slaughter of those cattle most at risk from the mad cow disease.

<HEADLINE> UN Council Concerned over Situation in Tajikistan </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, September 20 (Xinhua) -- The U.N. Security
Council expressed on Friday its concern at the deterioration of
the situation in Tajikistan and at the increasing tension along
the Tajik-Afghanistan border.
</P>
<P>
In a presidential statement, the council also said it was
concerned about the violations of the Tehran cease-fire agreement
of 17 September 1994 and about the failure of both parties to
implement the Ashgabat agreements.
</P>
<P>
According to the lastest report of U.N. Secretary-General
Boutros Boutros-Ghali, the agreements reached in Ashgabat last
July, which provided a real opportunity to stop fighting, have not
been implemented. On the contrary, in addition to the heavy
fighting in the Tavildara sector, military confrontations
intensified in the Karategin valley and the Garm district.
</P>
<P>
"The Security Council recalls the commitments made by the
Government of Tajikistan and by the leadership of the United Tajik
opposition (UTO) to resolve the conflict and to achieve national
reconciliation through peaceful means," the statement said.
</P>
<P>
"The Security Council commends the efforts of the United
Nations Mission of observers in Tajikistan (UNMOT) and urgently
calls upon the parties to cooperate fully with UNMOT and to ensure
the safety of the personnel of the United Nations and other
international organizations and also calls on them to lift all
restrictions on the freedom of movement of UNMOT personnel," the
statement said.
</P>
<P>
It also expressed welcome to the initiative of the
Secretary-General to arrange for an inter-agency mission to
Tajikistan to determine how to respond most effectively to the
humanitarian situation.

<HEADLINE> Ireland Warns Britain against Suspending Cattle Cull </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, September 20 (Xinhua) -- The Irish government has
warned Britain that its farmers would be the biggest losers if
London abandoned the planned slaughter of British cattle most at
risk from BSE or mad cow disease, according to press reports from
Dublin.
</P>
<P>
Speaking in an interview with the Irish national radio today,
Irish Agriculture Minister Ivan Yates said that there was no
prospect of an early lifting of the European Union (EU) ban on
British beef exports if Britain failed to honor the agreement
struck with EU partners at the Florence Summit in June.
</P>
<P>
The British government decided on Wednesday night to suspend
the selective cull in view of the so-called new scientific
findings that suggest that the mad cow disease would be over by
the year 2001 without the planned slaughter of 147,000 cattle.
</P>
<P>
"The biggest losers from the British decision are British
farmers, said Yates, whose country is holding the rotating
six-month EU presidency.
</P>
<P>
"I want to make it clear that the Irish presidency will try to
do everything in the dialogue between the European Commission, the
EU and Britain to try and reconstruct a basis to proceed," he
said.
</P>
<P>
On what Britain called new scientific findings, he noted that
"like any new scientific data it will be studied by the
Commission's experts, but we agreed in Florence that there was a
procedure Britain must follow to have the beef ban lifted."
</P>
<P>
The EU imposed the world-wide ban on British beef exports in
March when the British government admitted that there were
possible links between mad cow disease and its human equivalent
Creutzfeldt-Jacob Disease.
</P>
<P>
The EU leaders agreed at the Florence Summit in June to
gradually lift the ban on British beef on the condition that
Britain must implement a series of tough measures, including the
slaughter of those cattle which are most at risk from mad cow
disease.

<HEADLINE> Rwandan President Thanks Chinese Road-Builders </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KIGALI, September 20 (Xinhua) -- Rwandan President Bizimungu
Pasteur today thanked the Chinese government and people for their
unselfish contribution to the national reconstruction of post-war
Rwanda.
</P>
<P>
President Bizimungu delivered the appreciation in meeting with
visiting Chinese Deputy Minister of Communications, Liu E, at the
presidential palace in capital Kigali.
</P>
<P>
Liu and his delegation arrived here on Tuesday to attend the
"re-starting ceremony" of the construction of Rwanda's strategic
road linking the western prefectures of Gitarama and Kibuye. The
project is being carried out by China's state-run Roads and
Bridges Construction Company.
</P>
<P>
The Construction of the 74-kilometer road was first initiated
in early 1993, but was forced to halt due to the ethnic cleansing
and civil war. The Chinese company is currently responsible for
building 35 kilometers of the road which is the largest
building project in the post-war Central African country.
</P>
<P>
The Rwandan president said China is one of the first foreign states
to come back to the post-war Central African country to help its
national reconstruction.
</P>
<P>
And the Chinese construction company is the first foreign
company to help build Roads in post-war Rwanda which is still
threatened by the danger of ethnic fighting, he said.
</P>
<P>
Internal communications in Rwanda are operated almost
exclusively along the relatively well-developed road system as
there are no railways nor navigable waterways in the country.
</P>
<P>
Receiving three million U.S. Dollars in cheque from Liu as
part of the economic aid provided by the Chinese government,
Bizimungu said the donation would be used in developing the
exploitation of the marshland in Rwanda.
</P>
<P>
He also hoped to expand the economic cooperation with China in
agriculture, energy and other areas.
</P>
<P>
On political affairs, the Rwandan president stressed that his
government would stick to the "One China" policy and reaffirmed
that the People's Republic of China is the only legal government
of China while Taiwan is a province of China.
</P>
<P>
On his part, the Chinese deputy minister told President
Bizimungu at the meeting that China, as Rwanda and Africa's
long-standing brother and friend, would continue to support
Rwandan people's efforts for economic development and political
stability.
</P>
<P>
Chinese Ambassador to Rwanda, Huang She-Jiao, also attended
the meeting.

<HEADLINE> AIPO Calls for More Attention to Social Issues </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PHUKET, THAILAND, September 20 (Xinhua) -- Legislators from the
Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) today urged the
region's legislative bodies to pay more attention to social issues
like human resources development, education and protection of
women's and children's rights.
</P>
<P>
The 17th General Assembly of the ASEAN inter-parliamentary
Organization (AIPO) said in a joint communique released at the end
of five days of discussion that human resources development is
closely linked with socio-economic development.
</P>
<P>
Stressing the need to develop human resources in order to cope
with the emerging challenges and opportunities facing the world,
the communique called for formulating strategies on the
elimination of illiteracy and the establishment of education for
all citizens.
</P>
<P>
The communique said that during the past decades, there has
been a tendency to focus too much attention on material
development and insufficient attention on human resources.
</P>
<P>
To successfully develop human resources, consideration must be
given to education, culture, health, moral and family values, and
the environment, it added.
</P>
<P>
The communique also reaffirmed the need for ASEAN members to
cooperate in the field of education and strengthen exchanges of
personnel and experience. It called for ASEAN studies to be
included in schools' and universities' curricula.
</P>
<P>
On the protection of women's rights, the communique noted that
women have played an important role in social and economic
development. The discrimination against them in employment,
education and family should be eliminated, it said.
</P>
<P>
The communique also expressed concern over the increasing
problems related to children, such as child abuse, child labor,
child trafficking and child prostitution. It stressed the need to
strengthen legislation and law enforcement on the protection of
children.
</P>
<P>
On the labor and migration issue, the communique voiced concern
about the serious socio-economic problems caused by the influx of
illegal workers, but it added that maltreatment against them
should be redressed.
</P>
<P>
The five-day meeting also discussed political and economic
issues in region and the rest of the world.
</P>
<P>
Some 120 delegates from full AIPO members -- Indonesia,
Singapore, Malaysia, Thailand, the Philippines and Vietnam,
special observers from Brunei, and observers from Australia,
Cambodia, Laos, China, South Korea, attended the meeting.
</P>
<P>
The next AIPO General Assembly will be held in September 1997
in Indonesia.

<HEADLINE> OAU Urges for Easing of Girl Workload </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ADDIS ABABA, September 20 (Xinhua) -- The African Conference
on the Empowerment of Women held recently in Kampala, Uganda, has
declared that girls' domestic household workload should be
reduced drastically, said a press release available here today.
</P>
<P>
According to the release from the Organization of African
Unity (OAU), the conference underscored the need to reallocate
the workload in the family equitably as a means of improving
girls' enrollment and retention in school.
</P>
<P>
It called on African governments to introduce and develop
appropriate technology especially in rural areas to ease the
manual labor to which the girl-child is subjected, the release
noted.
</P>
<P>
The conference urged African governments to provide education
for all girls in mainstream schools through diversification of
the educational delivery system and by promoting alternative mode
of schooling.
</P>
<P>
The conference demanded parties concerned to institute
measures to ensure the protection of girls from all forms of
insecurity, violence, defilement and rape in school, on the way
to school and in the community at large.
</P>
<P>
About 30 OAU member states participated in the conference, out
of which 10 were led by ministers, according to the release.

<HEADLINE> African Sanctions Hit Burundi, Help Rebel </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, September 20 (Xinhua) -- Burundi's minority
Tutsi-dominated army today accused its African neighbors of
helping the majority Hutu rebels with sanctions on the Tutsi-led
government, citing intensified rebel attacks.
</P>
<P>
"The rebels are increasing their activities because the
sanctions are helping them," army spokesman Lieutenant-Colonel
Longin Minani said in capital Bujumbura, quoted by a report
reaching here today.
</P>
<P>
He was referring to today's rebel attack which killed four
civilians and wounded five in an ambush at a minibus near
Rutegama, about 65 kms east of the capital in what appeared part
of a step-up campaign against Burundian civilians.
</P>
<P>
"Why are they targeting civilians and avoiding where the
military are? Is this a political struggle, to kill innocent
civilians?" he asked.
</P>
<P>
Earlier in the week, the rebels killed five civilians in
another ambush. Clashes between the Hutu rebels and the Tutis
government troops have been escalated since the African neighbors
started to impose econonic sanctions and air embargo on Burundi
in late July.
</P>
<P>
The army is holding the view that fuel and food shortages in
the land-locked caused by the sanctions hinder the army's ability
to fight the rebels.
</P>
<P>
More than 150,000 people -- most of them civilians -- have
died in three years of violence between the army and Hutu rebels
waging a war for a greater political stake in Burundi.
</P>
<P>
Burundi has been hit by the sanctions aimed at forcing Tutsi
military leader Pierre Buyoya, who came to power after a military
coup to oust President Sylvestre Ntibantunganya in July, to talk
to Hutu rebels which make up 85 percent of the country's six
million people.
</P>
<P>
Earlier on Thursday, Burundi's exiled rebel leader Leonard
Nyangoma issued a statement saying he has taken over the
leadership of the main Hutu party, a claim promptly denied by the
Ntibantunganya who is still in exile in Tanzania.
</P>
<P>
Nyangoma heads the National Council for the Defense of
Democracy (CNDD), the political wing of FRODEBU, the main Hutu
rebel movement in Burundi which has been waging the bitter civil
war.
</P>
<P>
In Dar es Salaam, FRODEBU President Jean Minani insisted that
he remain the party's leader but he left open the possibility of
a vote to resolve the leadership dispute.
</P>
<P>
Regional states, under the leadship of the Organisation of
African Unity (OAU), have cut transport links and oil supplies to
the landlocked country and blocked exports of coffee, the main
cash earner, listing the restoration of the country's national
assembly and unbanning of parties among conditions for the
lifting of the embargo.
</P>
<P>
Buyoya said the military coup he had led was aimed at
preventing genocide. He has since announced plans for three years
of transitional rule.
</P>
<P>
His government has called for the boycotts to be lifted,
saying the country faces economic disaster.
</P>
<P>
Reports from Bujumbura say supplies of flour were running low
and fuel stations in the city center of the capital were deserted
on Friday afternoon, having no petrol to sell.
</P>
<P>
In a briefing to ministers on Thursday, Burundian Prime
Minister Pascal-Firmin Ndimira painted a gloomy picture of the
country's economy over the past few years, saying gross domestic
product per capita had fallen to around $200 last year from
around $230 before the civil war began in 1993.
</P>
<P>
Food production had fallen by between 15 and 20 percent,
posing a major threat of malnutrition.

<HEADLINE> Nepal Ratifies River Treaty With India </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KATHMANDU, September 20 (Xinhua) -- The Nepali parliament today
ratified a Nepal-India border river development treaty with an
overwhelming majority in a vote at a joint meeting of the two
houses of parliament.
</P>
<P>
The 265-seat parliament ratified the Mahakali treaty by a vote
of 220 to eight.
</P>
<P>
The joint meeting started about six hours later than schedule
to wait for the main opposition Communist Party of Nepal (United
Marxist Leninist, CPN-UML)'s final decision to support the
treaty's ratification.
</P>
<P>
The voting took place late tonight because the CPN-UML, which
holds the key to the ratification, did not make its decision to
support the treaty until evening.
</P>
<P>
Last February in New Delhi, Nepal and India signed the Treaty
of the Integrated Development of the Mahakali River, Nepal's
western boundary with India.
</P>
<P>
The treaty, which has been hailed as a watershed in Nepal-India
cooperation in water resources development, lays down principles
for benefit sharing on the development of the Mahakali River on an
equitable basis, Nepali officials have said.
</P>
<P>
However, the treaty had met strong opposition, especially
from the CPN-UML, which has 101 MPs in parliament and had demanded
"necessary corrections" to the treaty as a precondition for the
ratification.
</P>
<P>
The parliament had postponed its decision on the treaty several
times in the past week.

<HEADLINE> Chinese State Councillor Urges for Better </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ABUJA, September 20 (Xinhua) -- Visiting Chinese State
Councillor and Secretary-General of the State Council, Luo Gan,
said here today that China and Nigeria will make joint efforts to
expand cooperation and promote their existing good relations.
</P>
<P>
During the talks with Nigeria's Foreign Affairs Minister Tom
Ikimi today, Luo said that no matter what changes may take place
in the world, the friendly relations and cooperation between
China and Nigeria will continue to be developed and strengthened.
</P>
<P>
Luo thanked the Nigerian government for the "one-China" policy
it has pursued, saying this correct stand is a valuable support
to China's efforts toward the reunification of the country.
</P>
<P>
Luo noted that there are a few countries in the world which
have been attempting to interfere in the internal affairs of
other countries and impose their will on the countries under the
pretext of human rights. China and Nigeria have always understood
and supported each other in human rights issues, Luo added.
</P>
<P>
He reiterated China's consistent stand that every country has
its own right to choose the political system and development mode
suitable to it according to its own conditions, and no country
should interfere in other countries' internal affairs.
</P>
<P>
Luo praised the Nigerian government for its independent and
non-aligned foreign policy which is centered on Africa, saying
that China appreciates the active role Nigeria has played in

"one-China" policy it has been following and hoped China to
become stronger after it resumes sovereignty over Hong Kong next
year.
</P>
<P>

have many things in common. As one of the five permanent members
of the United Nations Security Council, China has always stood
firmly by the side of developing countries.

<TEXT>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, September 20 (Xinhua) -- Visiting Ugandan
President Yoweri Museveni today called for the revival of a dream
to form an east African federation of Uganda, Tanzania and Kenya.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a state banquet hosted in his honor by Tanzanian
President Benjamin Mkapa here this evening, President Museveni
said now it is high time to forge such a federation.
</P>
<P>
"Our countries should form the core on which greater unities
will be forged within our region. I look forward to greater
economic and political cooperation," he said.
</P>
<P>
Museveni said it was unfortunate that leaders outside
Tanganyika were hesitant to accede to the latter's proposal for a
federation in the early 1960s.
</P>
<P>
He said the former East African Community drifted apart
because of various reasons which included different economic
policies, basically socialist an capitalist lines.
</P>
<P>
However, Museveni said that since the three countries have
embraced the free market economy and are all at various stages of
liberalization and privatization of their economies, there is no
way the steps could be reversed.
</P>
<P>
"Economic cooperation is, therefore, easier to achieve today
than it has been for a very long time," said President Museveni.
</P>
<P>
He also commended the progress of the East African Cooperation
(EAC), which was launched last March, saying a lot has been
achieved so far which included full convertibility of the
currencies of the three states.
</P>
<P>
He said people of the three countries should be encouraged to
trade and invest across their borders, adding that the move will
give real meaning to the joint relationship.
</P>
<P>
The Ugandan president and his 25-man delegation arrived here
this morning for a four-day official visit of Tanzania Mainland
and Zanzibar.

<P>
PARIS, September 20 (Xinhua) -- France will provide 600 million
francs (120 million U.S. dollars) low-interest credits to Algeria
in 1996, a 40 percent drop from the previous year, reported Le
Monde daily today.
</P>
<P>
France and Algeria will sign a new protocol of aid in autumn
this year, when Algerian Finance Minister Ahmed Benbitour visits
Paris, the newspaper quoted official sources as saying.
</P>
<P>
However, France will send Algeria an extra 300 billion francs
of "mixed loans" provided by the French Treasury and French
banks in an old aid package which has not been used up.
</P>
<P>
The newspaper quoted Foreign Ministry officials as saying that
the decrease of aid has resulted from a drop of France's budget
spending for 1996.
</P>
<P>
The officials say that not only Algeria, all beneficiary
countries of French aid will receive less this year.

<TEXT>
<P>
ADDIS ABABA, September 20 (Xinhua) -- The Central High Court
of Ethiopia today sentenced to death three Egyptian terrorists
who attempted to kill President Hosni Mubarak of Egypt in Addis
Ababa on June 26, 1995, the Ethiopian News Agency reported.
</P>
<P>
A spokesman of the court was quoted by the report as saying
that the court passed the verdict as it found the Egyptians Sofit
Hassen Abdul Kabi, Abdul Kerim Abdul Naddi and Al-Arib Sadik
guilty of committing the crime.
</P>
<P>
The spokesman said the prosecutor has provided the court with
evidence proving the terrorists guilty of attempting murder,
killing two policemen on duty at the time of the incident and
wounding seven other civilians as well as smuggling prohibited
fire arms into the country.
</P>
<P>
The defense lawyer tried utmost for the defendants but in
vain. The court inflicted capital punishment on the criminals,
saying it was appropriate for the crimes committed.
</P>
<P>
According to Ethiopian law, death sentence should get the
approval of the head of state before it is executed.
</P>
<P>
The three of the 11 terrorists involved in the June 26, 1995
assassination attempt against President Mubarak were arrested
following the failed assassination plot. Five others had been
killed by Ethiopian security forces with another escaping from the
country on the same day.

CAIRO, September 20 (Xinhua) -- The Supreme Federal Court of
Ethiopia today passed death sentences against the three persons
convicted of attempting to assassinate Egyptian President Hosni
Mubarak in Addis Ababa last year.
</P>
<P>
The trio, who belong to Islamic groups, were proven to have
been involved in the attack, Egypt's Middle East News Agency
(MENA) quoted a statement released in Addis Ababa this evening
as saying.
</P>
<P>
Ethiopian President Negasso Gidada is expected to sign the
verdict shortly in preparation for execution, MENA said.
</P>
<P>
The indictment sheet charged that Safwat Abdel Ghani, Abdel
Karim al-Nady and al-Arabi Sediq Hafez were proven to have been
involved in the assassination attempt against President Hosni
Mubarak in Addis Ababa on June 26 last year.
</P>
<P>
By evidence, the trio were also implicated in the killing of
two Ethiopian security men, wounding three others during the
operation, and bringing in arms and ammunition with the intent of
destabilizing Ethiopia, MENA quoted the statement as saying.
</P>
<P>
The three culprits were arrested only a few days after having
attacked President Hosni Mubarak's motorcade near Addis Ababa
Airport, MENA said.

DAR ES SALAAM, September 20 (Xinhua) -- The Commonwealth
Science Council (CSC) today said Africa will not get out of
vicious circle of technological backwardness if African countries
do not get their women more educated in science and technology
field.
</P>
<P>
Closing a two-week information technology training workshop
for women scientists, technologists and researchers this
afternoon, CSC Deputy Secretary Judy Johnson said women are often
the end users of science and technology developments and can
contribute much to better design of equipment to be relevant to
everyday use.
</P>
<P>
She said that women have natural aptitude for skills important
in science, technology and research, particularly in areas
requiring attention to detail, computering and communication.
</P>
<P>
Director General of the Tanzania Commission for Science and
Technology Yadon Kohi said at the function that the country is
experiencing a serious deficiency in computer usage especially in
women scientists.
</P>
<P>
He said a survey revealed that Tanzanian women scientists,
technologists and researchers are not utilizing computers, one of
the important tools of research and development activities.

<HEADLINE> Prosecutor: Kaczynski Admits Bombings in His Journal </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, September 20 (Xinhua) -- Theodore Kaczynski kept a
journal in which he admitted 16 of the bombings attributed to the
Unabomber, prosecutors said today.
</P>
<P>
Assistant U.S. Attorney Robert Cleary discussed the journals
during a pretrial hearing in the U.S. District Court in
Sacramento, California. Kaczynski opted not to be present,
according to media reports.
</P>
<P>
Federal agents arrested Kaczynski, once a math professor, in
his remote Montana cabin after a 17-year manhunt. He is accused in
a 10-count indictment of bombings that killed two people and
maimed another two.
</P>
<P>
Cleary said prosecution evidence consists of a foot-thick stack
of documents, including the journal.
</P>
<P>
He said the case will include forensic evidence connecting the
mailing materials used in the bombings to Kaczynski.
</P>
<P>
Cleary made the disclosures after defense attorneys said they
needed more time to review hundreds of pages of photos and
documents they have received.
</P>
<P>
Federal defender Quin Denvir said the defense had been laboring
so far just to organize the materials, and called the case "the
biggest case, the most complex case that's ever been filed in this
district."
</P>
<P>
U.S. District Court Judge Garland Burrell delayed setting a
trial date until later in the day.
</P>
<P>
Cleary estimated the case would take three to four months to
try, with additional time for the penalty phase if Kaczynski is
found guilty.

<HEADLINE> US Government Renews Antitrust Scrutiny of Microsoft </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, September 20 (Xinhua) -- The Justice Department has
renewed its scrutiny of alleged antitrust violations by the
software giant Microsoft Corp., U.S. newspapers reported today.
</P>
<P>
A Justice Department spokesman confirmed Thursday that "we have
an ongoing investigation and it's continuing."
</P>
<P>
Netscape Communication Corp., Microsoft's major rival in the
U.S. market for software, wrote to the Justice Department last
month asking regulators to examine possible antitrust violations
in the marketing and distribution of Microsoft's Internet Explorer
software.
</P>
<P>
It said that Microsoft was unfairly offering computer makers
financial "inducements" for giving Microsoft's Internet software
an exclusive place on their computers, or for making Netscape's
product "far less accessible to users."
</P>
<P>
But Microsoft dismissed those claims as "wide and untrue."
Microsoft Senior Vice President William H. Neukom said Thursday
that "the facts will show that Microsoft is competing vigorously
and legally."
</P>
<P>
Microsoft, based in Redmond of Washington, has been the focus
of antitrust investigations in the past years.
</P>
<P>
Last year, the Justice Department opposed Microsoft's planned
2-billion-dollar purchase of Intuit Inc., maker of Quicken
personal finance software, and Microsoft had to pay Intuit 46.2
million dollars for the trouble.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. government has strengthened its antitrust efforts in
recent years as the market competitions are more and more fierce
and complicated.

<HEADLINE> Canada to Ask for WTO Panel on EU's Beef Ban </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
OTTAWA, September 20 (Xinhua) -- The Canadian government said
today that it will ask the World Trade Organization (WTO) for a
dispute settlement panel on the European Union's (EU) ban on
imports of beef produced with growth-promoting hormones.
</P>
<P>
Canada's request for a dispute settlement panel will be made
formally to the WTO's Dispute Settlement Body next Friday,
following unsuccessfully consultation with the EU, which
implemented the import ban in 1989.
</P>
<P>
Describing the ban as "unjustified," Canadian Minister for
International Trade Art Eggleton said that his country believes it
is not consistent with the EU's obligation under the WTO.
</P>
<P>
"We will take full advantage of the dispute settlement process
to fight this trade restriction," Eggleton vowed.
</P>
<P>
Canadian Agriculture and Agri-Food Minister Ralph Goodale said
the ban is not based on scientific evidence.
</P>
<P>
"Growth hormones pose no risk to human health when used
properly," he said, adding that this has already been made clear
by the Codex Alimentarius, the major international body on food
safety standards.
</P>
<P>
The ban severely limits access to the EU market at a time when
Canadian capacity to export beef is expanding. Canada has had
extensive discussion with the EU since the ban.
</P>
<P>
The United States also has a similar problem with the EU, and
has already launched a separate panel case through the WTO.

<HEADLINE> Election Campaign Winds Up in Greece </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ATHENS, September 20 (Xinhua) -- The election campaign in Greece
wound up this evening with the ruling Panhellenic Socialist Movement
(PASOK) staging a big rally in downtown Athens.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at the rally, Greek Prime Minister Costas Simitis warned
that a return of the New Democracy Party to power would spell
"anachronism for the country, and a loss of all hard-won gains for
the Greek people."
</P>
<P>
"For Greece to go forward to the 21st century, small steps will
not suffice, we need leaps and clear solutions. In the next few
years Greece must win the bet of its participation in European
integration. With the PASOK, Greece has a voice, strength, and
authority in Europe," Simitis declared.
</P>
<P>
The latest opinion polls show the main opposition New Democrats
are closing gap with the PASOK while smaller parties are seen as
the key to the election outcome.
</P>
<P>
The opinion polls also show each of the four smaller parties
could get up to 5 percent of the votes.
</P>
<P>
More than 8.5 million Greek people will go to poll Sunday to
elect the new 300-seat parliament.
</P>
<P>
The party which wins the majority in parliament will be
authorized to form a new government.

<HEADLINE> Return of Serbs to Croatia Possible Soon: Yugoslav </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BELGRADE, September 20 (Xinhua) -- Serbian Commissioner for
Refugees Bratislava Morina said today she was confident the issue
on the return of refugees would be settled soon.
</P>
<P>
In talks with representatives of the Serb Democratic Forum in
Croatia, the Committee for the Protection of Refugee Rights and
the Association of the Serbs from Croatia, Morina said the return
of refugees to their homeland in Croatia was a crucial issue.
</P>
<P>
"Now when the agreement on the normalization of relations
between Yugoslavia and Croatia was reached, there were fresh
possibilities for settling the issue," a statement released by the
Serbian Information Ministry quoted Morina as saying.
</P>
<P>
Yugoslavia and Croatia formally declared mutual recognition on
August 23, thus ending the five-year-long hostilities between the
two regional powers.
</P>
<P>
About 500,000 Serbs have been forced to leave Croatia since
1990 when the clashes triggered by the secession of Croatia began.
</P>
<P>
More than 250,000 Serbs escaped from Krajina alone after the
offensives launched by the Croat army in 1996.
</P>
<P>
Croatia has recently passed an amnesty law which has not,
however, covered all Serb refugees. The international community
has exerted pressure on Croatia to pass a law that could enable
all Serb refugees to return to their homeland without punishment.
</P>
<P>
In a related development, the Yugoslav government Commission
for Humanitarian Issues and Missing Persons and the Croatian
government Commission for Captured and Missing Persons have agreed
in the Croatian town of Slavonski Brod to hold their next meeting
in Belgrade on October 2-3.
</P>
<P>
Certain information was exchanged at the meeting in Slavonski
Brod Thursday and it was agreed that all remaining available data
on arrested, missing, or captured persons should be presented
during the talks in Belgrade, a Yugoslav commission statement said
today.

<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, September 20 (Xinhua) -- The United Nations
Security Council today urged Croatia to protect the human rights
of all persons present in Croatia, including the Serb population.
</P>
<P>
In a presidential statement, the council urged the Croatian
authorities to act immediately to improve the security situation
in the formerly Serb-controlled areas, where residents continued
to suffer from the danger of theft or assault at any time.
</P>
<P>
The Security Council regretted that many of its previous
requests had not been complied with by the Croatian government.
"Numerous incidents threatening the population in the formerly
Serb-controlled areas are a continuing source of concern and could
jeopardize the prospects for peaceful and substantial
reintegration of refugees and displaced persons in Croatia," the
statement said.
</P>
<P>
The council called on the Croatian government to implement the
comprehensive amnesty law through cooperation with the United
Nations Transitional Administration for Eastern Slavonia, Saranja
and Western Sirmium.
</P>
<P>
The council expressed concern that residents of Krajina and
Western Slavonia continue to suffer from inadequate security.
</P>
<P>
The council also reminded the Croatian government of its
obligation to cooperate with the International Tribunal for the
Former Yugoslavia and, in particular, to execute the arrest
warrants issued by the tribunal regarding individuals under
Croatian jurisdiction, and to transfer to the Tribunal all
indicted persons.

<P>
BEIJING, September 21 (Xinhua) -- The US's Western Atlas has
contributed much to China's oil and gas exploration in its 20
years of co-operation with China, a senior Chinese oil official
said here today.
</P>
<P>
The vice-president of the China National Petroleum Corp (CNPC),
Zhang Yongyi, pointed to Western Atlas' being the first large oil
company to co-operate with China's oil industry by providing
services as early as 1976.
</P>
<P>
In the past 20 years, Western Atlas, CNPC, and the China
National Offshore Oil Corp (CNOOC) have had wide-ranging
co-operation in oil logging technology, oil machinery
manufacturing, new types of oil production equipment, and
personnel training.
</P>
<P>
Western Atlas has provided a model for foreign oil companies
who came in subsequent years to cooperate with China's oil
industry, the official noted.
</P>
<P>
Since 1976, he said, Western Atlas has provided China with over
100 state-of-the-art "3700 series" digital oil logging systems and
14 "3600 series" oil logging systems, which have played important
roles in exploring for oil and gas in China.
</P>
<P>
Zhang said that Western Atlas recently provided China with 15
of the world's most advanced oil logging systems which will soon
be put to use in many oil fields. The new technology will help
speed up China's exploration of its huge oil and gas reserves.
</P>
<P>
Vice-minister of Mineral and Geological Resources Zhang Hongren
noted that Western Atlas has established a pattern of very good
cooperation with China.
</P>
<P>
Now that China's economy is developing very rapidly, there is a
great demand for energy resources, particularly oil and gas,
creating greater opportunities for Western Atlas to expand its
business in China.

<HEADLINE> Russia Resumes Withdrawal of Army From Chechnya </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, September 21 (Xinhua) -- Russia resumed the withdrawal
of its army from Chechnya today with the departure of the 276th
Motorized Rifle Regiment from the breakaway republic to its
permanent base in the Urals.
</P>
<P>
The pullout, part of Russian security chief Alexander Lebed's
Chechen peace plan, was suspended last week after a dispute over
the exchange of war prisoners between the Russian military and the
separatist rebels.
</P>
<P>
The dispute was later resolved after Lebed's talks with the two
sides earlier this week.
</P>
<P>
Lebed signed a peace agreement with Chechen rebels on August
31, ending a 20-month war in the republic in which an estimated
50,000 people were killed.
</P>
<P>
The withdrawal of the Russian army's estimated 11,000
servicemen will be completed in two stages by mid-December, the
Itar-Tass news agency quoted Vyacheslav Tikhomirov, commander of
Russian troops stationed in Chechnya, as saying at the send-off
ceremony today.
</P>
<P>
Troops which do not form part of the north Caucusian military
region will be pulled out by October 15 while the other troops
will return to their respective bases in the second stage, said
the commander.
</P>
<P>
But it's not clear when Moscow plans to begin withdrawing the
tens of thousands of Interior Ministry troops also stationed in
Chechnya.

<HEADLINE> Kuwaiti Official Returns Home from Russia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUWAIT CITY, September 21 (Xinhua) -- A senior Kuwaiti
official returned home today after a three-day visit to Russia.
</P>
<P>
During his stay in Russia, Kuwaiti Foreign Undersecretary
Suleiman Majed al-Shahin briefed Russian leaders on Kuwait's
current stand on the Gulf situation and the measures it has
taken to "protect its sovereignty," the official Kuwait News
Agency (KUNA) reported today.
</P>
<P>
The Kuwaiti official also held meetings with Russian First
Deputy Foreign Minister Igor Ivanov and Deputy Foreign Minister
Vikto Posovalyuk, during which he delivered a message from Kuwaiti
First Deputy Premier and Foreign Minister Sabah al-Ahmed al-Sabah
to Russian Foreign Minister Evgeny Maksimovich Primakov.
</P>
<P>
Al-Shahin arrived in Moscow Thursday within the framework of
Kuwait's diplomatic drive to brief Arab and international leaders
on measures taken by the Arab Gulf states in face of the current
Iraqi threats against its sovereignty, the KUNA reported.
</P>
<P>
Kuwait delivered messages to leaders of all the other five
Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) member states as well as Egypt and
Syria earlier this week, explaining the reason why it decided to
host nearly 5,000 U.S. troops and the stealth F-117 fighters on
its soil.
</P>
<P>
The GCC groups Saudi Arabia, Oman, Bahrain, Qatar, Kuwait and
the United Arab Emirates.
</P>
<P>
The United States had decided to send the stealths and the
troops to Kuwait as part of a larger scale campaign as a show of
force in the Gulf to contain Iraq following the Iraqi attacks
against U.S. planes patrolling the no-fly zone witnin Iraqi
territories.
</P>
<P>
Shahin said Kuwait "attaches great value to Russia's role and
initiative in managing to persuade Iraq not to open fire on
coalition planes patrolling the no-fly zone."
</P>
<P>
The Iraqi attack against the patrolling planes might provide
another excuse for the United States to launch a third salvo of
strikes against Iraqi targets, which Kuwait fears would bring
forth tragical consequences for Kuwait, he noted.

MOSCOW, September 21 (Xinhua) -- Li Ruihuan, visiting Chairman
of the National Committee of the Chinese People's Political
Consultative Conference (CPPCC), said here today that China hopes
to continually develop its relations with Russia.
</P>
<P>
Li, who arrived in Moscow Friday for a six-day visit, made the
remarks during a meeting with Yegor Semeonovich Stroyev, chairman
of the Russian Federation Council, the upper house of Russia's
parliament.
</P>
<P>
He said Russia and China should learn from each other's
experiences to help their respective countries advance and
prosper.
</P>
<P>
Despite their differences, the two neighbors share much in
common, said Li. Both are developing their economies and
improving the living standards of their people, guarding state
sovereignty and opposing foreign interference in their domestic
affairs.
</P>
<P>
The CPPCC is ready to play its part in promoting friendship and
mutually beneficial cooperation between China and Russia, said Li.
</P>
<P>
He believed satisfactory achievements have been made over
recent years in bilateral cooperation and exchanges in various
fields including politics, the economy, science and technology.
</P>
<P>
Stroyev said that the Russian Federation Council has established
sound relations with the Chinese National People's Congress, the
CPPCC and other social groups in China in recent years.
</P>
<P>
The speaker, who is scheduled to visit China next month, said
that he believed parliamentary exchanges between the two countries
will help push forward mutually beneficial bilateral cooperation.

<P>
HONG KONG, September 21 (Xinhua) -- Russia beat the
Netherlands 15-12, 15-12 and 15-10 in its last preliminary match
at a World Women's Volleyball Grand Prix leg here on Saturday,
securing a place in the four-team Grand Prix finals.
</P>
<P>
In the other match of the leg here Saturday, the United States
 outspiked China 15-11, 11-15, 16-14, 11-15 and 15-12 in a
two-hour marathon match.
</P>
<P>
Ace spiker Evguenia Artamonova scored 10 points and Elena
Godina added seven to boost Russia to the victory, helping the
team to win the Hong Kong leg with three straight triumphs.
</P>
<P>
Russian coach Nikolai Karpol said, "The first two sets were
quite hard for us. Especially the first set, which lasted more
than thirty minutes."
</P>
<P>
Dutch coach Bert Goedkoop said his team was not in shape both
physically and psychologically but kept fighting spirit high
throughout the tournament.
</P>
<P>
Both Russia and the United States collected 19 points from
seven wins and five losses in the four-leg preliminary stage but
Russia finished fourth overall on better set win-loss difference.
</P>
<P>
With one more match to play, Cuba and Brazil, which are
competing in a leg in Taipei along with Japan and South Korea,
garnered 21 and 20 points respectively and were guaranteed berths
 in the finals to be staged in the eastern Chinese city of
Shanghai next week. China qualifies automatically as the host.
</P>
<P>
When asked about the prospect of Russia in the finals, Karpol
said his team had yet to reach its top form.
</P>
<P>
"It's difficult to say right now where we'll finish. But I
think host China will have a better chance to win the finals," he
 added.
</P>
<P>
In the other match, American coach Taras Liskevych, who
announced one year ago he would retire, sealed his national
coaching career with a hard-fought victory.
</P>
<P>
"This is my last international match," said Liskevych, who had
 guided the team for 12 years. "I want to see my children grow
up. The job is really hard because I have to travel 150 to 160
days a year... It's time for someone else."
</P>
<P>
Danielle Scott scored 13 points, including two in the critical
 fifth set, to lead the American scorers. Captain Tara
Cross-Battle, who was named the Most Energetic Player of the leg,
 added 12 points and Paula Weishoff had 10.
</P>
<P>
The highlight of the match was in the third set, where China
came from 10-14 down to tie the score 14-14 under the strong
vocal support from a 3,600-strong crowd in the Queen Elizabeth
Stadium.
</P>
<P>
But the Chinese made two unforced mistakes to lose the set
14-16.
</P>
<P>
"We were really tired," said Chinese coach Lang Ping. "In the
last set the players didn't have much strength to jump high. At
that moment we had to have enough good tactics to win. But we
didn't."
</P>
<P>
The United States was second in the Hong Kong leg, followed by
China at third. Winless Netherlands finished fourth.

SUZHOU, September 21 (Xinhua) -- A symposium on the Chinese
sociologist Fei Xiaotong ended today in Wujiang, in east China's
Jiangsu Province, to honor the scholar's sixty years of research.
</P>
<P>
More than 200 Chinese and foreign scholars praised the
eighty-six-year-old scholar, who is now a vice-chairman of the
Standing Committee of the National People's Congress, for his
contributions to anthropology and sociology.
</P>
<P>
Fei's work on Chinese peasants' lives was praised as a
milestone by academics in other countries. Since the 1950s, Fei
has travelled repeatedly through most areas inhabited by China's
ethnic minorities to conduct his research.
</P>
<P>
Professor Fei also expanded his focus from village to town life
as the country gradually opened up to the outside world.
</P>
<P>
In 1990, he suggested that an economic development zone be set
up in the Yangtze River Delta, then followed this up with ideas on
how to develop the Yellow River delta, the Bohai Bay area, and
projects to aid the poor, all of which became part of the
country's policies and development plans.
</P>
<P>
The symposium was sponsored by the Central Committee of China
Democratic League, Beijing University, and the Wujiang city
government.

<HEADLINE> Israel Launches Air Strikes at Hezbollah Bases </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIRUT, September 21 (Xinhua) -- Israeli warplanes launched
this afternoon a series of air raids at guerrilla bases of the
Lebanese pro-Iranian Hezbollah, or Party of God, in a mountainous
area some 60 kilometers southeast of Beirut.
</P>
<P>
Police sources said that the Israeli warplanes carried out
four successive air strikes at Iglim Al-Toffah, or Province of
Apple, a ridge often used by Hezbollah guerrillas as a springboard
for attacks at Israeli occupation forces in south Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
The Israeli warplanes fired 10 air-to-surface missiles at
Jebal Al-Safi and the Mnita Heights in the area, but no words on
casualties were available.
</P>
<P>
The air raids were accompanied by artillery bombardments at a
number of targets in Iglim Al-Toffah, especially Ein Buswar,
igniting several fires of bushes, the police sources noted.
</P>
<P>
The air strikes were launched two days after a violent clash
between Hezbollah guerrillas and an Israeli force in south
Lebanon, in which two Israeli soldiers were killed and eight
others wounded.
</P>
<P>
The casualties have brought to 20 the number of Israeli soldiers
killed by Hezbollah in south Lebanon since the beginning of this
year.
</P>
<P>
The worst guerrilla operation took place on June 10, killing
five Israeli soldiers and wounding six others.
</P>
<P>
Israel said that three Hezbollah guerrillas were also killed
in Thursday's fighting.
</P>
<P>
Two hours before today's air strikes, Hezbollah announced that
its fighters launched three attacks at positions of Israeli forces
in the sector of the occupied border strip just opposite Iglim
Al-Toffah.
</P>
<P>
The Iranian-backed fundamentalist group claimed that several
Israeli soldiers were killed or wounded in the attacks.
</P>
<P>
Despite the return of a cautious calm to the last active
battlefield of the Arab-Israeli conflict, local inhabitants are
afraid of an Israeli military operation aimed at expanding
Israel's buffer zone in south Lebanon, according to the
state-run Lebanon Radio.
</P>
<P>
The radio quoted security sources in the Israeli
self-proclaimed "security zone" as reporting this afternoon that
the Israeli occupation forces have been determined to advance
to the Litani river.
</P>
<P>
The security sources said that the Jewish state sent
reinforcements into the buffer zone since Thursday and fortified
positions in the enclave.
</P>
<P>
More and more military vehicles and equipment were
transferred into the border strip in the past two days, the
sources added.

<HEADLINE> Shenzhen Exchange Hopes To Cash In On Hong Kong's Return </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Shenzhen, September 21 (Xinhua) -- The return of Hong Kong to
Chinese sovereignty on July 1, 1997, has brought some good
opportunities for the Shenzhen Security Exchange (SSE), one of two
in China.
</P>
<P>
This opinion was shared by participants at the recent Fourth
SSE congress. Shenzhen, in Guangdong Province, is a close neighbor
to Hong Kong and the city wants to use its geographical advantage
to speed up development of the stock market.
</P>
<P>
According to experts at the SSE, it is trying to learn from
Hong Kong's experience and to co-operate with counterparts
there. Hong Kong is a major financial center in Asia and is mature
and experienced.
</P>
<P>
Currently, the "'97 Concept" has given a push to stock trading
at the SSE which had a cumulative rise of 160 percent in its
Index. In the first eight months, SSE trading volume surpassed 400
billion yuan, accounting for 53 percent of the country's total.
</P>
<P>
Observers here point out that bullish trading at the exchange
shows investors' confidence in the future of Hong Kong after its
return and is helpful to the internationalization of the bourse.
</P>
<P>
Fourty-one B-shares are now listed at SSE and most of the 77
overseas Chinese B-share dealers are based in Hong Kong, and more
domestic companies are planning to be listed on the SSE.

<TEXT>
<P>
HARBIN, September 21 (Xinhua) -- A five-hectare plot in Bayan
County, in northeast China's Heilongjiang Province, with a dozen
imported crops planted tightly together is providing farmers with
a chance to study new techniques and use new developments for
production, said Geng Jiazhi, deputy head of the county foreign
experts bureau.
</P>
<P>
The new strains include northern-latitude scallions from Japan,
detoxified potatoes from Canada, and high-yield beans from the US.
</P>
<P>
The plot is the first to experiment with imported grain,
vegetable strains, and technology. It was built jointly by the
local foreign experts bureau and the agro-technology
popularization center.
</P>
<P>
Local farmers describe the plot as an "international
agro-technology exhibition in the fields", and people from other
counties and provinces have visited the plot to study the new
strains.
</P>
<P>
The county has expanded its areas that are using
plastic-sheeting and dense-growing methods 100-fold. An additional
100 million kg of grain are expected to be harvested this year, as

<HEADLINE> India's Rao Quits as Party Leader </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW DELHI, September 21 (Xinhua) -- India's former prime
minister P.V. Narasimha Rao today resigned as president of the
Congress party following summons to him by a Delhi court as a
co-accused in the 100,000 US dollar L.Pathak cheating case.
</P>
<P>
Rejecting Rao's application for discharge, additional session
judge Ajit Bharioke has ordered Rao to appear in person before the
court on September 30 for proceedings regarding framing of charges
against him.
</P>
<P>
Rao said in a statement today that he was relinquishing the
post of Congress president following the rejection by the learned
judge of his plea that the proceedings against him in the criminal
case be withdrawn.
</P>
<P>
"I am totally innocent and allegations leveled against me are
false, frivolous and baseless and are intended to cause harm to my
reputation."
</P>
<P>
Britain-based non-Indian resident businessman L. Pathak said
during his testimony before the Delhi court that he paid 100,000
US dollars to godman Chandraswami and his associate Kailash Nath
on the basis of the assurance given by Rao, the then external
affairs minister, at a New York hotel on December 22-23, 1983.
</P>
<P>
But Rao denied that he had met Pathak in New York at that time.
Chandraswami and his associate have been arrested and the court
has rejected their plea for bail time and again.
</P>
<P>
The Congress working committee, the highest policy-making body
of the party, will meet on Monday to elect a provisional president
to replace Rao.
</P>
<P>
The provisional president will remain in office until the All
India Congress Committee (AICC) elects a regular incumbent, AICC
General Secretary Devendra Dwivedi said.
</P>
<P>
Rao will continue to be leader of the Congress parliamentary
party, he added.

CAIRO, September 21 (Xinhua) -- Egyptian Foreign Minister Amr
Moussa said today that the Egyptian delegation to the U.N. General
Assembly would focus on the Middle East issues.
</P>
<P>
He was addressing reporters early this morning before leaving
here for New York on top of an Egyptian delegation to the 51st
session of the U.N. General Assembly which started last Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
He said the Egyptian delegation would raise, during the
sideline meetings, the issue of stalled Middle East peace process
and the Israeli refusal to implement the established agreements
with the Arab side.
</P>
<P>
Concerning the Israeli intransigence towards the Jewish
settlements, the Egyptian foreign minister said:"Israel has no
right to build such settlements," warning that such intransigence
could "undermine the peace process."
</P>
<P>
Asked to comment on the Israeli military activities in south
Lebanon, he said these moves infringe upon the Lebanese
sovereignty and threaten the security in the region as a whole.
</P>
<P>
As for the reelection of Boutros Boutros Ghali as
U.N. Secretary General, Moussa said the U.N. chief enjoys clear
support from the Organization of African Unity and the Arab League
as well as a number of major powers.

<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, September 21 (Xinhua) -- Iranian President Akbar
Hashemi Rafsanjani today called on the whole nation to be alert
and vigilant to confront enemy's challenges.
</P>
<P>
Siren was sounded nationwide in airports, schools, government
organizations and other public institutions at one o'clock this
morning to mark the beginning of the Defense Week.
</P>
<P>
Addressing the armed forces at Tehran's Freedom Square,
Rafsanjani said that defending the Islamic Iran has not ended yet
and Iran's enemies have not learned a lesson from the history,
therefore, the nation must remain alert and vigilant.
</P>
<P>
The Iranian president made the remarks on the 16th
anniversary of the outbreak of the Iraqi-Iranian war. He said
that defense is not limited to the country's borders and the
enemy has launched assaults from all directions.
</P>
<P>
Iraq waged a war with Iran for eight years from 1980 to 1988.
</P>
<P>
The Defense Week provides an opportunity not only to review
one of the most crucial and sensitive periods in the Iranian
history, but also an occasion to create a permanent alertness to
safeguard the revolution and the country.
</P>
<P>
Rafsanjani said that the enemies of Islam are now challenging
Iran in economic, cultural and scientific fields and are trying
to strike Iran through imposing sanctions.
</P>
<P>
He said that "the enemies of the revolution thought in vain
that by creating domestic unrest and disturbing Iran's political
balance, the way would be paved for their final assault against
Iran."
</P>
<P>
"The enemies of the revolution did not know then and still do
not know the Iranian nation and the structure of the Islamic
system," he was quoted by the official news agency IRNA as
saying.
</P>
<P>
"We wanted to punish the enemy in a way that he will not dare
to repeat his actions," Rafsanjani said.

ISLAMABAD, September 21 (Xinhua) -- The body of Murtaza Bhutto,
brother of Pakistani Prime Minister Benazir Bhutto who died in a
shootout between his supporters and police, arrived in his
hometown this afternoon.
</P>
<P>
The helicopter carrying the body of Murtaza and his wife Ghanva
landed at Larkana, home of the Bhutto's family in the north of
Sindh province, at 2:45 pm (1145 GMT), according to local press.
</P>
<P>
Nasrat Bhutto, mother of Murtaza who flew from London into the
southern port city of Karachi this morning where Murtaza was
killed, arrived in Larkana aboard the following helicopter.
</P>
<P>
Murtaza died from bullet wounds he received during a shootout
between his aides and police late Friday night.
</P>
<P>
Prime Minister Benazir Bhutto, who flew into Karachi from
Islamabad, visited Mideast Hospital, where her brother died on
operation table, early this morning and remained by the side of
her brother's body for some 45 minutes in a somber and tearful
composure, said local reports.
</P>
<P>
The situation in Larkana was reportedly grim as Murtaza's
supporters had the shops, schools and transport shut down and
converged at Murtaza's residence there.
</P>
<P>
Murtaza will be buried alongside his younger brother Shahnawaz
Bhutto, who was poisoned to death in Paris in 1985.
</P>
<P>
The pilot of one of the helicopters which carried the body of
Murtaza felt difficulty in lifting the chopper as a number of
supporters of Murtaza clung to the base rod in a bid to board the
machine.
</P>
<P>
While the helicopter managed to lift off, many of the
supporters of Murtaza who crowded around the chopper fell down but
one of them remained clung to the copter.
</P>
<P>
The helicopter flew up and later landed again when the youth
clinging to copter's rod fell down and the chopper flew away.

<HEADLINE> Indian Former PM Summoned in Cheating Case </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW DELHI, September 21 (Xinhua) -- Former Indian prime
minister P.V. Narasimha Rao was today summoned again to appear
personally before a Delhi court on September 30 for framing of
charges against him in a 100,000 U.S.-dollar cheating case, the
Press Trust of India said.
</P>
<P>
The fresh summon was a major blow to the Congress party
president who had challenged a similar summon order passed by
another Delhi court on July 9.
</P>
<P>
Rao has been charged with helping a controversial godman in
cheating a non-resident Indian businessman, Lakhubhai Pathak, of
100,000 dollars in 1983 by falsely promising newsprint and paper
pulp contracts to him.
</P>
<P>
Rao's case was first taken up by a Delhi court of magistrate
Prem Kumar who issued summons to the former prime minister on July
9 based on a testimony of Lakhubhai Pathak.
</P>
<P>
Having failed to challenge the summons issued by magistrate
Kumar in the Delhi High Court, the former prime minister, through
his counsel, later submitted a plea to India's Supreme Court,
requesting it to either quash the summons or transfer the case to
another judge for a fair trial.
</P>
<P>
At a hearing held on Rao's plea on August 22, the apex court
also upheld the summons issued by magistrate Kumar against Rao but
agreed to transfer the case to another Delhi court of judge Ajit
Bharihoke.
</P>
<P>
In his order issued this afternoon, judge Bharihoke said there
was prima facie evidence against the Congress party president to
warrant the summon.
</P>
<P>
He ordered the former prime minister to appear personally in
his court on September 30.
</P>
<P>
Rao, who has managed to linger on as leader of the Congress
party since his party's defeat in the recent general elections,
has been under increasing pressure to resign because of his
alleged involvement in several scandals including the cheating
case.

Guerrilla issue arose early last year when Kenya said that a
guerrilla organization led by a Kenyan, John Odongo, existed in
Uganda. But the Ugandan Government made it clear that there was
not any Kenyan guerrilla organization in Uganda.

Thereafter, the disputed Kenyan refugee, John Odongo, was
transferred to Ghana from Uganda instead of being extradited to
Kenya as asked by the Kenyan Government.

<HEADLINE> Bangladesh Faces Severe Arsenic Contamination </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DHAKA, September 21 (Xinhua) -- Bangladesh is facing severe
arsenic contamination as at least 35 million pounds of toxic
arsenic compounds have entered the country through imported
electrical wooden poles during the last 20 years, sources said
here today.
</P>
<P>
They said that during the period over 2.5 million poles coated
with arsenic compounds, which were used as preservatives to
protect the poles from the high temperature, were imported and
installed across the country for rural electrification.
</P>
<P>
The soil and underground water at places where such poles have
been installed might get severely contaminated in the long run,
the sources said, adding that in fact the contamination has been
found only 50 to 100 feet deep in the soil and underground water
in different areas, especially in many districts in the
southwestern part of the country.
</P>
<P>
Expressing his grave concern over the situation, a high
official of the Bangladesh Atomic Energy Commission suggested soil
and underground water test of the areas where the wooden poles
have been installed.

<HEADLINE> Only "Relevant" Issues Should Be Discussed At WTO </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SINGAPORE, September 21 (Xinhua) -- Singapore Minister for
Trade and Industry Yeo Cheow Tong said today that only "relevant"
issues should be discussed at the inaugural Ministerial Conference
of the World Trade Organization (WTO), which will be held here on
December 9-13.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a press conference, the minister said that in the
process of determining the agenda for the Ministerial Conference
(MC), several issues had surfaced demanding to be discussed at the
Singapore MC (SMC).
</P>
<P>
"There have been calls by some countries for the SMC to
consider investment, labor standards and government procurement,"
he noted.
</P>
<P>
However, he said that not all countries agree that these issues
should be discussed. Many felt that the critical task is to ensure
the full and faithful implementation of the Uruguay Round (UR)
Agreements and to launch further work on the built-in agenda.
</P>
<P>
"They fear that WTO might be distracted from these critical
tasks by these new issues," he said.
</P>
<P>
As chair of the WTO MC, the minister said, Singapore would have
to bridge these differences "in a balanced, objective and neutral
manner."
</P>
<P>
"This is why Singapore has advocated that the new issues
proposed for the WTO agenda be subject to a three-point objective
test: is the issue relevant to trade; is WTO the most appropriate
forum to deal with the issue; is the issue ripe for discussions,"
Yeo said.
</P>
<P>
"The key word is 'relevance'; WTO and its first MC should not
be distracted from its core activities by considering issues that
are not relevant to trade," the minister stressed.

BEIJING, September 21 (Xinhua) -- When the heat of summer gives
way to the coolness of the fall, Beijing is again embraced by
another heat wave - the heat wave of international conferences.
</P>
<P>
Last September, the United Nations 4th World Conference on
Women held here threw international limelight upon Beijing and,
one year later, the Chinese capital once again drew the world's
attention as it played host to a succession of world conferences
that covered a wide-range of topics.
</P>
<P>
Over the past six weeks, Beijing has welcome the visit of
scholars and experts, statesmen and government leaders, and
celebrities from all around the world, who came to meet their
colleagues and for an exchange of views on themes of universal
concern in the political, economic and academic fields.
</P>
<P>
At the recent 30th International Geological Congress, the 62nd
Conference of the International Federation of Library Associations
(IPLA), the 13th International Archives Congress, the 21st Century
Forum, and the 96th Inter-Parliamentary Conference that ended on
Friday, participants have conferred on topics ranging from the
cause of the extinction of dinosaur and preservation of ancient
books, to accomplishment of sustainable economic growth, guarantee
of regional security and stability, and protection of the rights
of women and children.
</P>
<P>
"Beijing has rapidly becoming a center for international
conferences, and an arena for discussions and consultations on
major issues the world is facing and other academic topics." said
Jia Jike, deputy general manager of the Beijing International
Conference Center.
</P>
<P>
The veteran in organizing international conferences held the
designating Beijing as a hosting city to these conference
epitomizes China's strenuous effort to pursuing the reform and
opening-up drive.
</P>
<P>
Moreover, it shows that China is drawing more attention from
the international community with the progress it has made in
various fields, Jia said, and that the country's aspiration to
know more about the outside world is enhanced by the reform and
opening-up policy.
</P>
<P>
Joseph Reed, deputy UN secretary-general who attended the 96th
Inter-Parliamentary Conference (IPC) as the special representative
of UN Secretary-General Boutros Boutros-Ghali, was deeply
impressed by China's work of organizing the conferences.
</P>
<P>
China organized one of the most important conferences in this
century -- the UN 4th World Conference on Women in a most
effective way, Reed noted, and, to his knowledge, made equal
success in organizing a series of other conferences.

<P>
LONDON, September 21 (Xinhua) -- The following are major news
items in leading British newspapers today:
</P>
<P>
The Times:
</P>
<P>
-- All British police officers will be asked to declare whether
they are Freemasons or members of any other semi-secret
organizations under plans being prepared by chief constables to
curb the organization's links with forces.
</P>
<P>
Financial Times:
</P>
<P>
-- Brian Pitman, who has become one of the dominant figures in
U.K. banking since he took over as chief executive of Lloyds Bank
13 years ago, on Friday embarked on one more bid before stepping
down from day-to-day management.
</P>
<P>
The Daily Telegraph:
</P>
<P>
-- British government ministers are now resigned to Europe
maintaining the worldwide ban on British beef exports until BSE,
or "mad cow" disease, has been eradicated probably not until 2001.
</P>
<P>
The Independent:
</P>
<P>
-- British Prime Minister John Major on Friday ignored a storm
of European protest over the government's decision to abandon its
undertaking to slaughter extra cattle, urging an end to "hysteria"
over BSE, or "mad cow" disease.
</P>
<P>
The Guardian:
</P>
<P>
-- The leaders of Britain's four million Catholics said Friday
night that they felt betrayed by the Bishop of Argyll who three
years ago lied and give "cast iron" guarantees that rumors about
sexual misdemeanor were unfounded.

Ahmed Fathi Sorour, president of the Council of the
Inter-Parliamentary Union (IPU) and speaker of the Egyptian
parliament, described China's preparation for the IPU conference
"perfect" and "most successful"; while Robert Halverson, speaker
of the Australian parliament cited the present conference as one
being organized better than any preceding conferences.
</P>
<P>
It is true, indeed, that the Chinese Government attaches great
importance to the conferences, and high-ranking officials were
appointed as chief organizers of these conferences so as to
guarantee their success.
</P>
<P>
The 62nd IPLA conference with an attendance of 2,600 was the
biggest in scale in IPLA's history, and the first conference of
its kind that had ever been held in China - one of IPLA founding
nations.
</P>
<P>
IPLA President Robert Wedgeworth said it is a good, reasonable
choice to host the 62nd IPLA Conference in Beijing, showing the
world's growing interest in China and its thirst to be acquainted
with China, as well as the fast development of libraries in
China. He called the conference "unprecedentedly success."
</P>
<P>
In the three days from September 4 to 6, world celebrities like
Lee Kuan Yew, Senior Minister of the Singaporean cabinet, former
Japanese Prime Minister Noburu Takeshita, former German Chancellor
Helmut Schmidt, former US secretaries of state Henry Kissinger and
George Schultz, and some 50 fellow politicians and experts
converged on the 21st Century Forum to discuss the political and
economic trends in Asia in the next century and the role China is
to play.
</P>
<P>
Schmidt said the forum provided a rare opportunity for
high-level exchanges of views, while Kissinger praised it as
a "very good beginning" that has benefited participants a lot.
</P>
<P>
For various reasons, there are still some misunderstandings
about China in the outside world. The international conferences
provided a good chance for the international community to
understand the country better.
</P>
<P>
Many of the participants to the conferences came to China for
the first time. And many said the country was more beautiful and
more modernized than they had expected, and the Chinese people
are very hospitable.
</P>
<P>
Yeo Toon Chia, a member of the Singaporean parliament, noted
that people from different countries met in Beijing to see for
themselves the progress China has made, which was conducive to
correcting their previous misconceptions about the country.

In the view of IPU's Sorour, China has not only had an ancient
civilization, but it will also have a bright and promising future.
</P>
<P>
It is of great significance that the IPU conference was held in
China, Sorour said, expressing IPU's appreciations of the
country's opening-up and progress, and helping other countries to
know more about China.
</P>
<P>
For the Chinese, the chances for international exchanges
provided by the conference are likewise precious.
</P>
<P>
Wang Jinyu, a professor from Zhengzhou University, came to
Beijing for the International Archives Congress, although he was
troubled by heart disease at the time. His daughter accompanied
him to Beijing to take care of him.
</P>
<P>
The rare opportunity to meet fellow archivists from both China
and abroad is too precious to give up, the professor said, adding
that he has aspired it for eight years.
</P>
<P>
The warm reception extended to participants from the world over
can also be regarded as China's gesture and resolve to open itself
to the rest of the world. At each of these conferences, many
young volunteers speaking different languages came to assist
overseas participants.
</P>
<P>
Many overseas delegates were impressed. "Those energetic young
people, warm-hearted and hospitable, are ready to render a helping
hand," a Dutch delegate commented.
</P>
<P>
Delegations of parliamentarians from more than 120 countries,
including some 60 speakers and deputy speakers, came to attend the
IPU conference in Beijing, which created a rare opportunity for
the National People's Congress (NPC) to further expand ties with
parliaments in other countries.
</P>
<P>
The unique effect of parliamentary diplomacy was fully
demonstrated by the meeting between NPC officials and the
parliamentary delegation of Malawi, with whom China has not yet
forged diplomatic ties.
</P>
<P>
During the conferences, Chinese leaders met with the
participants and made speeches at these conferences, expressing
China's commitment to and its wishes for modernization and world
peace, and calling for the establishment of new international
political and economic orders.
</P>
<P>
Autumn is the season of harvesting, and the conferences held
in Beijing recently have been really fruitful.
</P>
<P>
On the three academic conferences, research findings made in
respective scientific fields in this century were summarized,
major scientific issues discussed, and scientific development in
the next century explored and predicted.
</P>
<P>
On the first conference of the 21st Century Forum and the 96th
Inter-Parliamentary Conference, international and regional issues
of pressing importance were discussed and consensus reached,
greatly contributing to world peace and development.
</P>
<P>
Chinese leaders have, upon different occasions, voiced their
wishes to "let the world understand China and let China understand
the world."
</P>
<P>
When China is expanding its opening up to the world, the
convocation of more international conferences in the country
indicates that the country is increasing its understanding of the
outside world, and contributing still more to world affairs.

<HEADLINE> Southern Lebanese Truce Monitors to Meet Sunday </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIRUT, September 21 (Xinhua) -- International monitors
overseeing violations of a cease-fire between Lebanon and Israel
are to meet on Sunday in southern Lebanon's border town of
Nagoura, the state-run Lebanese Radio reported this morning.
</P>
<P>
The radio said that the meeting of the cease-fire monitoring
committee is to be held in the headquarters of U.N. peace-making
forces in southern Lebanon at an urgent request by the Lebanese
government.
</P>
<P>
This will be the fourth meeting of the five-state committee,
but the first at Lebanon's request. The previous meetings were
called by Israel.
</P>
<P>
The committee, comprising representatives from the United
States, France, Syria, Lebanon and Israel, was set up in line with
a cease-fire understanding mediated by the U.S. between Lebanon
and Israel in April, which put an end to a 17-day Israeli blitz
in southern Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
Lebanon's chief delegate to the committee, Colonel Maher
Toufeyli, will ask the committee to denounce a recent breach of
the April understanding by Israel for bombarding southern
Lebanese villages and wounding a number of civilians, the
official radio announced.
</P>
<P>
The committee made no decision in its three previous meetings,
the first of which was held on August 8.
</P>
<P>
A fragile calm has returned to southern Lebanon after
Thursday's bloody clash between Israeli forces and guerrillas of
the pro-Iranian Hezbollah, or Party of God.
</P>
<P>
Israel said that two Israeli soldiers and three Hezbollah
guerrillas were killed, and eight Israeli soldiers wounded, in
the fighting.
</P>
<P>
Thursday's casualties raised to 20 the number of Israeli
soldiers killed by Hezbollah in southern Lebanon since this
year.
</P>
<P>
Hezbollah said its fighters clashed with an Israeli force
trying to advance out of the so-called "security zone".
</P>
<P>
The pro-Israeli South Lebanon Army sources said the guerrillas
fired machineguns and anti-tank rockets on the Israeli patrol
near Sejoud and Rihane villages in the northern part of the
buffer zone.
</P>
<P>
Immediately after the ambush, Israeli gunners fired more than
800 shells at Hezbollah-controlled hills and villages in Iglim
Al-Toffah, or Province of Apple, some 60 kilometers southeast of
Beirut.
</P>
<P>
The state-run Lebanon Radio said that during a meeting in
Damascus on Friday, Syrian President Hafez Assad and Lebanese
President Elias Hrawi discussed the situation in southern Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
The Syrian-Lebanese summit came less than 24 hours after a
Thursday night visit to the Syrian capital by Lebanese Prime
Minister Rafik Hariri and his meeting with Syrian Vice President
Abdel Halim Khaddam.

socialist party PASOK and the conservative New Democracy party are
shoulder to shoulder in their support rates, according to a latest

</P>
<P>
Simitis, who is the successor of Andreas Papandreou after the
latter resigned in January, is calling for a "new Greece" turned

populist policy once defended by Papandreou.

<HEADLINE> S. Korea's Foreign Reserves Surpass 60-Billion-Dollar Mark </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SEOUL, September 21 (Xinhua) -- South Korea's foreign reserves
have broken the 60-billion-U.S.-dollar mark this year despite a
snowballing current account deficit, the Ministry of Finance and
Economy said today.
</P>
<P>
South Korea's total foreign reserves, or the sum of official
reserves held by the Bank of Korea, namely the country's central
bank, and foreign exchange owned by local banks, amounted to 62.78
billion dollars as of the end of June this year, according to the
ministry.
</P>
<P>
South Korea's total foreign reserves stood at 61.12 billion
dollars as of the end of April this year, exceeding the
60-billion-dollar level for the first time.
</P>
<P>
The surge in the nation's total foreign reserves was attributed
to increased foreign capital inflows.
</P>
<P>
In the first half of this year, South Korea's long-term capital
balance posted a surplus of 5.23 billion dollars, while its
short-term capital surplus stood at 7.18 billion dollars, the
ministry said.
</P>
<P>
In contrast, the country's current account deficit surged to
9.4 billion dollars in the first six months of this year.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, South Korea's official foreign reserves held by the
cental bank rose to 36.56 billion dollars as of the end of June
this year from 32.71 billion dollars at the end of last year.

<HEADLINE> Weekly Report on Malaysia's CPO, Tin and Rubber </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUALA LUMPUR, September 21 (Xinhua) -- Malaysia's crude palm
oil (CPO) physicals went through "see-saw" trading this week on
the back of bearish August production and higher stocks report
released by the Palm Oil Registration and Licensing Authority
(PORLA) on Monday.
</P>
<P>
PORLA said stocks piled up to 800,893 tons last month from
755,665 tons in July, while production also rose to 810,550 tons
against 722,382 tons previously.
</P>
<P>
The market also followed closely the softer prices on the Kuala
Lumpur Commodity Exchange and on the Chicago Board of Trade.
</P>
<P>
News that India would temporarily stop palm oil import from
Malaysia until April next year pressured the market downwards.
</P>
<P>
On the cash market, September-South contract settled at 1,165
Ringgit (about 466 US dollars) per ton from 1,195 Ringgit (about
478 US dollars) per ton last week.
</P>
<P>
Tin price on the Kuala Lumpur Tin Market (KLTM) closed lower
this week in thin trading following the softer performance on the
London Metal Exchange (LME) throughout the week.
</P>
<P>
The market closed at 14.99 Ringgit (about 5.996 US dollars) per
kg against 15.02 Ringgit (about 6 US dollars) per kg last week.
</P>
<P>
Higher offering from miners also contributed to the easier
market.
</P>
<P>
Accumulated turnover for the week narrowed to 556 tons from 657
tons last week.
</P>
<P>
While on the Malaysian rubber market, it also ended the week
easier in quiet trading on lack of fresh incentives in the market.
</P>
<P>
The market closely followed the bearish sentiment of regional
markets throughout the week.
</P>
<P>
On the local front, producers and suppliers were cautious to
sell on the back of thin supply in the market, and instead
preferred to wait for better prices next week.
</P>
<P>
The RSS One dropped to 324.50 sen (about 129.8 US cents) per kg
from 329.00 sen (about 131.6 US cents) per kg last week, while SMR
20 decreased to 313 sen (about 125.2 US cents) per kg against
314.00 sen (about 125.6 US cents) per kg last week.
</P>
<P>
The market was also devoid of fresh fundamental news in view of
a holiday in Japan but inquiries for SMR grades from China and
Middle East were noted mid-week.

<HEADLINE> Tanzania Urges Uganda to Make Full Use of Dar </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, September 21 (Xinhua) -- President Benjamin Mkapa
said last evening that Uganda was routing only 10 percent of its
cargo through the Dar es Salaam Port and appealed to the landlocked
neighbour to make full use of the modernised facility.
</P>
<P>
He told visiting Ugandan President Yoweri Museveni that the volume
of Ugandan transit cargo using the port increased from 50,000 tonnes
in 1993/94 to 95,000 tonnes last year, but added that this only raised
the share of that country's cargo using the port from five to 10
percent.
</P>
<P>
"It is an increase, but far too low still. We have taken the
challenge to be more efficienct and competitive earnestly so as to
offer even better services to you, and hopefully be found worthy to
handle more Ugandan transit goods," he said.
</P>
<P>
The bulk of Uganda cargo is handled by the Kenya port of Mombassa.
</P>
<P>
President Mkapa, who was speaking at a state banguet he hosted for
his guest, said that President Museveni's visit was an opportunity for
them to agree on new ways to expand bilateral relations, especially of
the private enterprises in the two countries.
</P>
<P>
He said private enterprises had a critical role to play in
promoting bilateral relations.
</P>
<P>
President Mkapa praised Museveni for his economic and
political achievements.
</P>
<P>
Uganda now enjoys a six percent economic growth, inflaion is
at 2.4 percent and the Gross Domestic Product (GDP) has doubled
from three billion U.S. Dollars in 1986 to six billion Dollars.
</P>
<P>
President Mkapa also renewed Tanzania's commitment to East African
Cooperation and called for joint initiatives to improve the region's
infrastructure and telecommunications links to enhance intra-trade and
investment.
</P>
<P>
President Mkapa reiterated that the Great Lakes states would
only ease trade sanctions they imposed on Burundi after seeing
evidence that the military junta in Bujumbura had returned to the
peace process launched in Mwanza by retired President Mwalimu
Julius Nyerere.  enditem

<HEADLINE> Chinese Vice Premier Meets U.S. Entrepreneurs </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CHICAGO, September 20 (Xinhua) -- Chinese Vice Premier and
Foreign Minister Qian Qichen today praised U.S. entrepreneurs for
their efforts to promote the Sino-U.S. economic relations and
trade.
</P>
<P>
Meeting representatives of leading American corporations, Qian
said the economic relations and trade between China and the United
States have developed fast in the past years with trade volume
totalling 40.8 billion U.S. dollars in 1995, 16 times that of
1979, when the two countries established diplomatic relations.
</P>
<P>
He said that the achievement is related to the efforts made by
the entrepreneurs present on the occasion.
</P>
<P>
Qian pointed out that some problems remain in bilateral
economic and trade relations, the level of economic cooperation
and trade does not match the status of the two big countries, and
cooperation is often disturbed by political factors from the
U.S. side.
</P>
<P>
He said that the annual review of China's Most Favored Nation
(MFN) trade status by the United States and the obstacles set by
the United States to prevent China from joining the World Trade
Organization (WTO) have not only created unstable factors in
bilateral economic relations, but also harmed the Sino-U.S.
relations as a whole.
</P>
<P>
Qian expressed the hope that the two countries should take the
favorable chance and make joint efforts to enhance dialogue,
reduce troubles and expand cooperation.
</P>
<P>
He hoped that the American entrepreneurs would continue to play
an active role in promoting bilateral relations.
</P>
<P>
Representatives from leading U.S. enterprises including
Motorola, General Motors, General Electric, IBM and Boeing were
present at the meeting.
</P>
<P>
The entrepreneurs expressed satisfaction over their cooperation
with China, optimism about the prospects of China's development,
as well as confidence in expanding cooperation with China.
</P>
<P>
They agreed that economic and trade relations between the two
countries should have a normal and stable foundation and favorable
political conditions.
</P>
<P>
It was announced at the meeting that an enterprise league will
be set up in Illinois to push for China's permanent MFN status and
to support China's joining of the WTO at an early date.

<HEADLINE> Arafat Urges German Businesses to Invest in Palestine </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BONN, September 20 (Xinhua) -- Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat
today appealed for German economic investment in infrastructure
and other projects in the Palestinian self-rule area.
</P>
<P>
Arafat made the appeal in Frankfurt when meeting German bankers
and businessmen before winding up his two-day Germany tour.
</P>
<P>
There is an urgent need for investment in water system,
transport, housing, health and education, Arafat said. He said
the infrastructure of the Palestinian people's homeland had been
"wholly destroyed."
</P>
<P>
He also called the continued closure of the Palestinian
self-rule area by the Israeli authorities an economic
"catastrophe" for the self-rule area, saying it costs the
Palestinians seven million U.S. dollars a day.
</P>
<P>
However, Martin Kohlhaussen, a spokesman for the Commerzbank,
one of Germany's largest banks, said the Palestinian self-rule
area has "great economic potential," but the "unstable political
situation" there constitutes the biggest obstacle for German
investors.
</P>
<P>
Frank Niethammer, head of Frankfurt's chamber of commerce and
industry, said it would be "illusory" to expect private German
enterprises to entertain long-term projects.
</P>
<P>
The German government has provided 15 million marks (10 million
dollars) of aid for the Gaza airport. It prepares to provide 25
million marks of aid for municipal and environmental protection
projects in Palestine.
</P>
<P>
At the end of his tour, Arafat also received two million marks
of private donation from the Germans.

<HEADLINE> Alleged Israel's Spy Executed in Lebanon </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIRUT, September 21 (Xinhua) -- A spy of Israel, who was
accused of assassinating a brother of a U.S.-wanted officer of
the pro-Iranian Hezbollah, or Party of God, and two other
people, was executed in a Beirut prison this morning.
</P>
<P>
Ahmed Abdu Badia Halaq, 44, was executed at dawn by firing
squad.
</P>
<P>
He was accused of detonating a bomb on Beirut's southern
suburbs and killing Fuad Moghaniyeh, a Hezbollah officer and
brother of Imad Moghaniyeh wanted in the United States for
the 1985 hijacking of a TWA airliner and the kidnapping of
several Westerners.
</P>
<P>
The bombing on December 21, 1994, in the Sfeir neighborhood
also led to the killing of Mohammed Masalmani and Mohmoud
Saleh Hassoun and the wounding of some 15 others.
</P>
<P>
Halaq was reportedly a member of an espionage network of
the Israeli intelligent agency Mossad in Lebanon, and he was
the first collaborator of the Jewish state executed in this
country.
</P>
<P>
Lebanese President Elias Hrawi, the only person in Lebanon who
can commute or cancel death sentences, Thursday ignored a
last-minute plea for clemency by Halaq and confirmed the
execution.

<HEADLINE> Perot Condemns Debate Commission Ruling </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, September 20 (Xinhua) -- Reform Party presidential
nominee Ross Perot today sued the Federal Election Commission
which recommended Perot be excluded from presidential debates.
</P>
<P>
Perot accused the commission of violating the constitutional
rights of voters in recommending that televised debates be limited
to President Bill Clinton and Republican presidential candidate
Bob Dole on grounds that only they had realistic chances of
winning the November election.
</P>
<P>
He alleged that the bipartisan debate commission illegally
endorses or contributes to political candidates or parties and
should not be allowed to host the debates.
</P>
<P>
His campaign also plans to file a suit Monday seeking an
injunction to halt any presidential debates planned by the
commission.
</P>
<P>
Perot's running mate Pat Choate echoed Perot's complaints today
in an appearance on the "Talk Back Live" program of the Cable News
Network (CNN), and blamed Dole for supporting the commission's
recommendation.
</P>
<P>
President Clinton has said he would welcome Perot in the
debates.
</P>
<P>
Clinton and Dole campaign officials were scheduled to resume
negotiations Saturday on the debates.
</P>
<P>
The Perot campaign has qualified for 29.13 million dollars in
federal funds, based on the Perot garnering 19 percent of the
popular vote in 1992 as an independent candidate.

<HEADLINE> EU Helps COMESA Promote Regional Trade </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUSAKA, September 21 (Xinhua) -- The Common Market for Southern
and Eastern Africa (COMESA) has got a grant of 2.4 billion Kwacha
(about two million US Dollars) from the European Union (EU) for a
Cross Border Initiative (CBI) Program aimed at promoting regional
trade.
</P>
<P>
A ceremony for signing the grant was held here on Friday. The
initiative will enhance regional cooperation in eastern and southern
Africa through the elimination of obstacles to cross-border trade,
investment and payments.
</P>
<P>
COMESA Secretary General Bingu Mtharika said on the occasion that
reduction of obstacles would help create efficient patterns of
economic growth in the region.
</P>
<P>
He noted, ''intargeting the inter-linked areas of cross-border
trade, investment and payments through a comprehensive and pragmatic
approach, the CBI constitutes a substantial step forward towards
integration.''
</P>
<P>
He added, ''the underlying hope is that the private sector will no
longer feel confined to the restricted regional market, but rather
consider widening opportunities of a sub-regional market which is in
line with the objective of COMESA with regard to the establishment of
wider economic space for sustained economic growth and development.''
</P>
<P>
EU head of delegation to Zambia Charles Brook said that there was
need for regional cooperation to accelerate full integration into
the world economy of the emerging economies.
</P>
<P>
He noted, ''COMESA has a major role to play in this process as it
relates to the region of Africa comprising 20 member states and of
course the broadening of opportunities for cooperation with other
regional and sub-regional entities.''
</P>
<P>
The funding is aimed at strengthening COMESA's foundation towards
the creation of a common market for eastern and southern Africa.
Trade and other factors to trade including transport, tariffs,
regulations, monetary policies and economic liberalization are
central to process in this direction. enditem

Al-Ahram:

<P>

second channel of the Israeli Television telecast Friday, said
that the theory of "security for peace" adopted by Israel is

sentences against the three persons convicted of attempting to
assassinate Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak in Addis Ababa last
year.
</P>

<HEADLINE> DPRK Demands Withdrawal of U.S. Troops from Northeast Asia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PYONGYANG, September 21 (Xinhua) -- The Democratic People's
Republic of Korea (DPRK) today demanded the United States
completely withdraw its military bases and troops out of Japan and
South Korea.
</P>
<P>
The demand came from a commentary published today in the Rodong
Sinmun, mouthpiece of the ruling Workers' Party of the DPRK, on
the result of a referendum held in Japan's southernmost island of
Okinawa over the future of the U.S. military bases in this
prefecture.
</P>
<P>
About 90 percent of the Okinawans supported the idea to reduce
the U.S. military bases on the island. The commentary described
the outcome as only too natural, according to the DPRK's Korean
Central News Agency (KCNA).
</P>
<P>
The commentary said that the U.S. military bases and troops in
Japan have not only restricted Japan's sovereignty and inflicted a
heavy burden and misfortune on the Japanese people, but also
intensified the situation in northeast Asia and jeopardized peace
and security in this region.
</P>
<P>
Foreign military bases in northeast Asia are a result of the
Cold War and the withdrawal of the U.S. bases and troops after the
end of the Cold War is the call of the times, the article said.
</P>
<P>
It pointed out that the U.S. military bases and troops in South
Korea and Japan serve the U.S. policy of threatening of and
aggression against the DPRK and other Asian countries.
</P>
<P>
As long as these bases and troops remain in South Korea and
Japan, the people in this region will never lead a free and
peaceful life, nor can they expect a detente and a lasting peace
in this part of the world, the commentary warned.
</P>
<P>
If the United States has ever wanted to see an ease of tension
and peace in northeast Asia, the commentary said, it must take
practical measures to withdraw its aggression forces and military
bases from Japan and South Korea as soon as possible.

WASHINGTON, September 20 (Xinhua) -- Pernell Whitaker retained
his World Boxing Council welterweight title with a unanimous
decision over Puerto Rican Wilfredo Rivera in Miami on Friday.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. champion, known for his technical skills, displayed an
uncharacteristic power-punching style early in the 12-round fight,
which was a rematch of his controversial split-decision over
Rivera in April.
</P>
<P>
The 32-year-old Whitaker recovered from a knockdown in the
fifth round and sent Rivera to the canvas with a straight left to
the chin in the sixth.
</P>
<P>
Rivera was stunned and rose midway through the count. The round
proved to be pivotal as Rivera lost a point earlier for a low blow.
</P>
<P>
The three judges scored it 115-113, 115-111 and 113-111 for
Whitaker, who took his record to 39-1-1 with 16 knockouts.
</P>
<P>
Rivera, who fell to 23-2-1, recovered from the knockdown to win
two of the next three rounds. Whitaker reverted to his familiar
counter-punching style to hold off Rivera in the closing rounds.

<HEADLINE> Stereoscopic, Scenic Park Built on Ancient City Walls </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
XI'AN, September 21 (Xinhua) -- Six hundred-year old city walls
and moats winding around them in the ancient capital of Xi'an,
northwest China, has been turned into a stereoscopic park that has
drawn 600,000 visitors annually over recent years.
</P>
<P>
The walls of the ancient city, built in the third year under
the rein of Emperor Hongwu during the Ming Dynasty (1368-1644),
are 13.74 km long and 10 to 12 m high, and they are 15 to 18 m
wide at the bottom and 12 to 14 wide at the top.
</P>
<P>
There are gate towers and watchtowers at the city's east, west,
south and north gates, which were used for resisting intruding
troops at ancient times in case of war.
</P>
<P>
And outside the walls are open grounds 20 to 60 meters wide,
which is encircled by a moat, five to 10 m wide in different
sections.
</P>
<P>
The city walls of Xi'an are so far the largest and only ancient
walls in China, which remain intact.
</P>
<P>
With the support of the central government, Shaanxi province
and its capital city of Xi'an invested huge sums of money in 1983
in the maintenance and improvement of the city walls.
</P>
<P>
Today, the open grounds outside the city walls have turned into
a stereoscopic park, where people can take stroll along paths amid
flowers and beautiful plants, or take a rest at winding paths on
grounds. Moreover, visitors can ascend the walls for a bird-eye
view of Xi'an city.

<HEADLINE> Kenyan Teachers, Students Urged To Stop Devil </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, September 21 (Xinhua) -- Kenyan Minister for
Education Joseph Kamotho has warned teachers and students not to
involve devil worship cults and rituals, otherwise they will risk
being sacked or expelled.
</P>
<P>
In a statement on Friday, Kamoth said that the Kenyan
Government is going to issue specific instructions and guidelines
to schools after confirming the existence of devil worship cults
in the country.
</P>
<P>
The Kenyan government, in a statement on Thursday, confirmed
that satanic cults in the country practised rituals such as human
sacrifice, the drinking of human blood and cannibalism. Other
rituals listed are incantations in unintelligible languages,
sexual abuse and rape, that of children and minors in particular,
and black magic use of narcotic drugs and snakes.
</P>
<P>
Kamotho said that boarding schools are mainly the places where
devil worship is practised.
</P>
<P>
The minister urged religious organisations, teachers and
parents to strengthen their guidance and counselling in schools
to ensure that the evil practices are stamped out.

<HEADLINE> Roundup: Nepal Ratifies Treaty with India </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KATHMANDU, September 21 (Xinhua) -- The Nepali parliament has
finally ratified the Mahakali border river treaty with India with
an overwhelming majority vote after over one week of prolonged and
heated debate in and outside parliament.
</P>
<P>
A joint meeting of the upper and lower houses Friday endorsed
the Mahakali treaty by a vote of 220 to 8 in the 265-seat
parliament.
</P>
<P>
The voting took place last night as the main opposition
Communist Party of Nepal (united Marxist Leninist, CPN-UML) did
not make its final decision to support the treaty until the
evening.
</P>
<P>
CPN-UML, the single largest party in the parliament, holds the
key to the fate of the treaty with its total of 101 MPs in both
houses.
</P>
<P>
The joint parliament meeting started about six hours later than
scheduled due to the delayed decision by the opposition party.
</P>
<P>
A 41-member CPN-UML central committee earlier in the day passed
a resolution to support the treaty by a wafer thin majority vote
of 17 to 16, showing the obvious differences over the treaty
within the party leadership.
</P>
<P>
The party's decision drew strong criticism from many of its MPs
at a parliamentary party meeting held later to order the MPs to
vote for the treaty in parliament. Some MPs abstained from the
voting.
</P>
<P>
A relieved prime minister Sher Bahadur Deuba after the treaty's
ratification told reporters that the Mahakali treaty has opened up
new vistas for Nepal's national development.
</P>
<P>
He also expressed thanks for the cooperation from the parties
in parliament especially the main opposition.
</P>
<P>
The main opposition CPN-UML earlier this week decided to
support the Mahakali treaty conditionally, raising a few issues
for assurances from the governments of Nepal and India as
preconditions for its ratification.
</P>
<P>
The issues raised by the party, among others, include the
status of the Mahakali river, India's proposed purchase of Nepal's
power from a future hydro project on the river, and Nepal's rights
over the Mahakali water.
</P>
<P>
The opposition party Friday painfully worked out the decision
to support the treaty at the last minute after the Indian
government pledged to consider these issues positively in a
Thursday letter to the Nepali government, although the India's
reply was not considered a commitment as demanded earlier by the
opposition.
</P>
<P>
Nepal and India signed the integrated development treaty on the
Mahakali river, which lies on Nepal's western border, last
February after major political parties in Nepal reached a
consensus on the issue.
</P>
<P>
The treaty has been hailed by Nepali officials as a diplomatic
achievement and a watershed in Nepal-India cooperation on water
resources development.
</P>
<P>
The treaty provides framework arrangements of cost and benefit
sharing on future hydro projects on the border river, they said.
</P>
<P>
It has established principles of equal water sharing between
Nepal and India, which Nepal had struggled for over the past three
decades, Water Resources Minister Pashupati Rana said.
</P>
<P>
The Nepali government has adopted a policy to upgrade the
country's economy through developing the abundant water resources
with an estimated hydropower potential of 83,000 megawatts.
</P>
<P>
Nepal has intention to export hydro electricity to the
neighboring India which faces an acute power supply shortage in
the next 20 years due to the rapid industrial growth.

<HEADLINE> State Natural Science Fund Committee in Suport of Basic Research </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GUIYANG, September 21 (Xinhua) -- The State Natural Science
Fund Committee has become a leading channel to help stablize the
contingent of China's basic research personnel, according to Sun
Shu, deputy director of the committee.
</P>
<P>
To date, there are more than 60,000 research workers and 20,000
graduate students doing basic researches throughout the country.
</P>
<P>
Over the past decade and so, the committee has granted its aid
to more than 3,000 major state research projects, Sun said.
</P>
<P>
The fund amounted to only 80 million yuan when it was first set
up in 1986, Sun said, adding that it now has over 600 million yuan.
</P>
<P>
According to Sun, only 20 percent of the applied projects are
eligible for aid and the competition is very acute. The committee
gives priorities to creative, even though somewhat risky,
projects, and place emphasis on research work in the frontier
fields.
</P>
<P>
The committee set up a State Science Fund for outstanding young
research workers in 1994, providing as much as 600,000 yuan for a
project so as to attract young scientists studying or working
overseas and welcome them home. It has aided 130 young scientists
in 1994 and 1995 alone.
</P>
<P>
The principles of creativity, fairness and displaying democracy
have been underlined for the operation of the State Natural
Science Fund, Song said.
</P>
<P>
To date, more than 50 science funds have been established
across the country on the basis of these principles, involving a
total of 250 million yuan (30 million US dollars).

<HEADLINE> China Urges U.S. to Seize Chance for Better Ties </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CHICAGO, September 20 (Xinhua) -- The United States and China
should seize the present favorable opportunities to improve their
relations, Chinese Vice-Premier and Foreign Minister Qian Qichen
said here today.
</P>
<P>
Sino-U.S. relations are now blessed with good and cherishable
opportunities for development, Qian said at a reception hosted by
the newly established Illinois Coalition to Support Stable
U.S.-China Commercial Relations in Chicago this evening.
</P>
<P>
Qian, who has just concluded a four-day visit to Canada,
arrived here today for a brief visit on his way to New York for
the 51st United Nations General Assembly session.
</P>
<P>
"It was hoped that the two countries could seize the present
favorable opportunities and work together to strengthen dialogue,
increase common ground, reduce trouble and develop cooperation, so
as to seek a continuous improvement and growth of China-U.S.
relations," Qian said.
</P>
<P>
He said that there have emerged signs of improvement in the
bilateral relations as a result of joint efforts and the two sides
have decided through consultation to exchange a series of high
level visits within this year.
</P>
<P>
He disclosed that he was to meet U.S. Secretary of State Warren
Christopher during his stay in New York and that the
China-U.S. Joint Commission on Commerce and Trade will soon meet
in Washington.
</P>
<P>
Qian stressed that China and the U.S., as two major powers,
share broad common interests. Maintaining a sound and stable
relationship is not only in their fundamental interests, but also
benefits world peace and stability.
</P>
<P>
He noted that China, as the biggest developing economy, and the
United States, as the largest developed one, can complement each
other and work together to tap their huge potential.
</P>
<P>
But there still exist some problems in Sino-U.S. economic
relations, Qian said, and the level of economic cooperation and
trade between the two nations is not yet commensurate with their
status as two major powers.
</P>
<P>
"The two countries could well carry out better cooperation,
which is, however, not always free from the undesirable political
factors of the American side," said Qian.
</P>
<P>
He said that the annual review of China's Most Favored Nation
(MFN) status and the erection of obstacles to China's entry to the
World Trade Organization (WTO) by the United States are
destabilizing to the economic ties, and can bring damage to the
overall relations.
</P>
<P>
"The mutual granting of the MFN treatment on reciprocal basis
by China and the United States is a basic condition for their
normal trade. Rather than a unilateral favor, it meets the needs
for mutual opening and common prosperity."
</P>
<P>
Qian said both sides should treat and advance economic
relations and trade from a strategic perspective.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Attempts to Block Boutros-Ghali's Re-election </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, September 20 (Xinhua) -- The United States is
stepping up its drive to oust Boutros Boutros-Ghali as the
U.N. secretary-general, started by Secretary of State Warren
Christopher months ago, but found little support from other
countries.
</P>
<P>
In an unusual public campaign against the re-election of
Boutros-Ghali as U.N. secretary-general for another five years,
Princeton Lyman, U.S. assistant secretary of state for
international organizations, came out on Friday to say that
Washington will not back him as he has not given enough attention
to restructuring the United Nations.
</P>
<P>
"We don't want the matter to go down to the wire on December
31st, nor do we wish a confrontation," he told a press conference.
</P>
<P>
Boutros-Ghali's first five-year term expires at the end of this
year.
</P>
<P>
"If we start the process early enough, we believe a consensus
can be reached in the Security Council on a new
secretary-general," Lyman said.
</P>
<P>
In a follow-up news briefing, State Department spokesman
Nicholas Burns said that despite oppositions from other countries,
"the United States is not inclined to step back from its position."
</P>
<P>
The United States sees the United Nations and its
Secretary-General Boutros-Ghali as a free-spending bureaucracy
dominated by Third World countries hostile to the United States.
</P>
<P>
Its excuse to force Boutros-Ghali out is that he has not put
the first priority to the reform of the world body.
</P>
<P>
"We need a secretary-general who puts this at the top of his
list. We came to the conclusion that this was not the present
secretary-general's top priority," said Lyman.
</P>
<P>
Burns said that Christopher has discussed the issue on Friday
with Brazilian Foreign Minister Luiz Felipe Lampreia and will
raise it with other foreign ministers in New York next week.
</P>
<P>
President Bill Clinton, when attending the signing of a
U.N. treaty to ban nuclear test next week, will hold a few brief
meetings with foreign leaders, including Japanese Prime Minister
Ryutaro Hashimoto. Lyman said that could provide an occasion for
Clinton to make the point that Boutros-Ghali should be replaced.
</P>
<P>
Boutros-Ghali, a 73-year-old Egyptian diplomat, is eligible to
stand for re-election and has refused the U.S. suggestions that he
leave his post.
</P>
<P>
He told the British newspaper Independent that the United
Nations needs continuity of leadership and that his departure
"would create more problems for this institution."
</P>
<P>
In denouncing U.S. criticism of his lack of enthusiasm in
reform, he said, "We have begun a series of reforms. I want to be
re-elected to be able to continue the reform."
</P>
<P>
Washington's opposition to Boutros-Ghali has received little
support so far from other countries, while Boutros-Ghali has
powerful support from most U.N. member states. Among the permanent
members of the council, France is understood to be a strong
backer, Russia also sides with Boutros-Ghali.
</P>
<P>
Russia expressed its strong support on Friday for
Boutros-Ghali's re-election as secretary-general.
</P>
<P>
"Russia supports Secretary-General Boutros-Ghali," said Russian
Ambassador Sergey Lavroy. "He is doing a good job and there is no
reason to say he cannot have a second term."
</P>
<P>
So far, American diplomats at the United Nations have been
unable to get other delegations to discuss a successor. Lyman said
the United States would press to have the Security Council take up
the situation next month.

<HEADLINE> Italian PM Meets With Chinese Military Leader </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ROME, September 20 (Xinhua) -- Improving the Italian-Chinese
friendly relations is one of the important objectives for the
Italian government, said Italian Prime Minister Romano Prodi here
today when meeting with a Chinese military leader.
</P>
<P>
There is great potential for the development of cooperation
between the two countries, said Prodi during his meeting with a
Chinese delegation led by Liu Huaqing, vice chairman of the
Military Commission of the Central Committee of the Chinese
Communist Party.
</P>
<P>
During the meeting, the two sides exchanged views on the
Italian-Chinese relations and other issues of common concern.
</P>
<P>
They said they will make joint efforts to develop the long
standing, steady and all round relations between the two countries.
</P>
<P>
Prodi voiced his government's support for China's efforts to
join the World Trade Organization (WTO) and to develop cooperation
with Europe.
</P>
<P>
He recalled that he had visited China for several times and he
is a guest professor of the Tianjin University, located in the
city of Tianjin, east of the Chinese capital of Beijing.
</P>
<P>
Prodi expressed his government's willingness to develop
cooperation with China in economy, science and technology, small
and medium-sized enterprises and the military industry.
</P>
<P>
He said that on his next visit to China, he will bring a group
of businessmen with him.
</P>
<P>
During the meeting, Liu firstly conveyed the regards from
Chinese Premier Li Peng to Prodi.
</P>
<P>
He expressed China's appreciation for Prodi's efforts to
promote the Italian-Chinese friendly cooperation and China's
willingness to develop the 21st-century-oriented relations with
Italy and other countries in Europe.
</P>
<P>
Liu added that China will continue to pursue the policy of
reform and opening up and will focus its efforts on economic
construction.
</P>
<P>
He said that China's national defense will serve its economic
construction.
</P>
<P>
The aim of China's national defense construction is
self-defense and China will learn from foreign experience in the
field of national defense on the basis of self-reliance, Liu
said.

<HEADLINE> Backgrounder: Tragic Death of Pak PM's Brother </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, September 21 (Xinhua) -- Pakistani Prime Minister
Benazir Bhutto's estranged brother, who died on operation table
after injury in an encounter with police late Friday night in
Karachi, had fought his sister and threatened to depose her.
</P>
<P>
Benazir had been at odds with her younger brother since his
return to Pakistan.
</P>
<P>
After 16 years of self-exile in Syria, Murtaza returned to
Pakistan in 1993 soon after Benazir was elected as prime minister
for the second time.
</P>
<P>
Murtaza was jailed for six months upon his return, facing a
charge of air piracy in connection with the highjacking of a
Pakistan International Airlines plane in 1981.
</P>
<P>
He proclaimed his innocence and accused his sister of harassing
him.
</P>
<P>
While in jail, Murtaza fought and won elections to the assembly
of the southern Sindh province, the Bhutto family's home province.
</P>
<P>
In 1995, Murtaza formed his own faction of Pakistan People's
Party (PPP) founded by his father Zulfiqar Ali Bhutto.
</P>
<P>
Murtaza Bhutto, who turned 42 on Thursday, married a
Palestinian, Ghanva, and left behind him a daughter Fatima and a
son Zulfiqar Ali Bhutto Jr, named after Murtaza's father and
Pakistan's late prime minister.
</P>
<P>
A distraught Benazir left the federal capital of Islamabad for
Karachi right after she was informed of the death of her brother.
</P>
<P>
Bashir Riaz, a family friend of the Bhuttos, was quoted as
saying, "all I can say is that she is rushing off to Karachi."
</P>
<P>
"She was crying," he said, "As you can imagine she is very
upset."
</P>
<P>
Their mother Nasrat Bhutto, who supported her son, left London
soon after she received the news and will arrive in Karachi today.
</P>
<P>
The Bhutto family has a tragic history. Zulfiqar Ali Bhutto was
hanged on April 4, 1979 by General Mohammad Zia-ul-Haq who staged
a coup and arrested Bhutto.
</P>
<P>
Murtaza's younger brother Shah Nawaz Bhutto was poisoned to

<P>
Murtaza formed a terrorist organization abroad during his exile
after the coup of Zia-ul-Haq in a bid to overthrow the latter's
government while Benazir believed in democratic means to topple
the late general, which became the main reason of their discord.
</P>
<P>
After Zia-ul-Haq was killed in an air crash, the brother and
sister fought for the leadership of the PPP, which Benazir won and
later was elected as the first woman prime minister in both
Pakistan and Islamic world.

<HEADLINE> Austria, Russia Discuss NATO Expansion </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
VIENNA, September 20 (Xinhua) -- The eastward expansion of the
North Atlantic Treaty Organization today dominated the talks
between visiting Russian Foreign Minister Yevgeny Primakov and
Austrian Chancellor Franz Vranitzky and Foreign Minister Wolfgang
Schuessel.
</P>
<P>
Primakov told reporters after the talks that NATO's plan to
expand eastward is absolutely unacceptable to Russia.
</P>
<P>
He stressed that security of some countries cannot be
guaranteed by sacrificing that of others.
</P>
<P>
NATO's expansion will create a new demarcation line in Europe
and place Russia in a "very difficult geo-political position," he
said.
</P>
<P>
But the Russian minister, who came to Vienna for a meeting with
NATO Secretary-General Javier Solana, said that Russia is willing
to break the stalemate through dialogues.
</P>
<P>
Primakov proposed that the security policy for the future
Europe should be worked out jointly by all major organizations
under the auspices of the Organization for Security and
Cooperation in Europe (OSCE).
</P>
<P>
He also said he does not want to see Austria, a country which
has chosen neutrality, join NATO though the issue has to be
decided by the Austrians themselves.
</P>
<P>
Austrian Chancellor Vranitzky said that it is unrealistic for
Austria to talk about its NATO membership now because a decision
on the issue will have to be after the EU inter-governmental
meeting next year.
</P>
<P>
Austrian Foreign Minister Schuessel told Primakov that the
issue of Austria's neutrality can only be decided by the Austrians
themselves and that what Moscow said is only an "opinion."

<HEADLINE> China Calls for Balanced Nuclear Inspection and Utilization </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
VIENNA, September 20 (Xinhua) -- The International Atomic
Energy Agency (IAEA) should balance its efforts between tightening
inspections and promoting the peaceful utilization of nuclear
energy, said Jiang Xinxiong, director of China's State Atomic
Energy Agency.
</P>
<P>
Jiang made the remarks at the annual general assembly of the
IAEA, which concluded today after delegates from 101 countries
adopted a series of resolutions on nuclear safety and
technological assistance.
</P>
<P>
Jiang said the IAEA should promote international cooperation in
the peaceful utilization of nuclear energy, while strengthening
inspection to prevent the proliferation of nuclear weapons.
</P>
<P>
"There should be an appropriate balance between the two tasks,"
Jiang said. "This is not only the common desire of the majority of
IAEA member states, but also the foundation for the IAEA's
existence and growth."
</P>
<P>
China has always attached great importance to the peaceful
utilization of nuclear energy and nuclear technology and to
international nuclear cooperation on an equal footing, Jiang said.
</P>
<P>
He said China has signed inter-governmental or
inter-departmental cooperation agreements with nearly 20 countries
on the peaceful utilization of nuclear energy. Besides, it has
established trade relations and technological cooperation with
more than 40 countries and regions.
</P>
<P>
China has always insisted that all nuclear materials
transferred from China for peaceful purpose be inspected by the
IAEA and it has never provided assistance to nuclear installations
uninspected by the IAEA, Jiang said.
</P>
<P>
In recent years, Jiang said, it has become increasingly clear
that there is a growing emphasis on tighter nuclear inspections in
the IAEA.
</P>
<P>
"The IAEA should pay more attention to strategic issues, such
as financing, in the area of technological cooperation in order to
maintain a balance between tighter inspections and the promotion
of peaceful utilization," Jiang said.
</P>
<P>
He said that new methods of nuclear inspection must respect the
national sovereignty of the countries being inspected. Increased
inspections should not become an obstacle to the development of
nuclear technology and nuclear industry in the developing
countries and to the international cooperation in the peaceful
utilization of nuclear energy.

<HEADLINE> Pak Police Blame Aides of PM's Brother for Shooting </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, September 21 (Xinhua) -- Pakistani police blamed
aides of Pakistani Prime Minister Benazir Bhutto's brother Murtaza
Bhutto for an shoot out with police which resulted in the death of
Murtaza late Friday night.
</P>
<P>
According to a police spokesman, Murtaza, 42, was critically
injured in an exchange of fire between his aides and police on
Friday night in Pakistan' southern port city of Karachi, and
succumbed to his injuries at 11:53 pm (2053 GMT).
</P>
<P>
Giving details, the police spokesman stated that when some
policemen tried to stop Murtaza and his escort for a check when he
returned home from a reception, his aides in the escort opened
fire, injuring several policemen and a passerby.
</P>
<P>
Police retaliated in self-defense and after an encounter they
found six dead and five injured including Murtaza, and six were
apprehended alive.
</P>
<P>
Murtaza, critically injured in the neck and left arm, was
rushed to Mideast Hospital where he finally succumbed to injuries
at 23:53 hours, the police spokesman added.
</P>
<P>
Two G-3 rifles along with four magazines and 21 rounds, two
pistols and some other weapons were recovered from the dead, the
injured and the persons apprehended, said police.
</P>
<P>
Eye witnesses said dozens of Murtaza's supporters, all of whom
were apparently armed, attacked the Karachi police chief's nearby
house. The chief's guards opened fire, the witnesses said.
</P>
<P>
The police spokesman said Murtaza and his 15 to 16 armed aides
had raided Pakistan's Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) Garden and
CIA Riaz Center in Karachi on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Cases were registered accordingly. The next day two bomb blasts
took place in the city, which is assumed to be a retaliation for
the arrest of Ali Sunara, one of Murtaza's key aides, Mohammed Ali
Sunara.
</P>
<P>
Sunara was wanted on several charges ranging from terrorist
acts to murder.
</P>
<P>
There has been considerable tension in recent days between
police and Murtaza's supporters following the arrest of Sunara.
</P>
<P>
Hundreds of paramilitary officers and police were deployed to
the posh Clifton Road neighborhood, home to some of Pakistan's
wealthiest residents, including Bhutto's family, and many
diplomats.

TOKYO, September 21 (Xinhua) -- The U.S. dollar is likely to
remain firm against the yen in Tokyo next week, because of
speculations of higher U.S. interest rates and stable stock and
bond prices on Wall Street.
</P>
<P>
Traders bought back the dollar after a sharp plunge of the
currency on Wednesday following the announcement of a
larger-than-expected U.S. trade deficit for July.
</P>
<P>
Traders said that the U.S. currency is expected to move between
108 yen and 110 yen.
</P>
<P>
The dollar rose slightly against the yen since Friday because
of the chance that U.S. interest rates might be raised at the

<HEADLINE> Tourist Festival to be Held in Shanxi </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TAIYUAN, September 21 (Xinhua) -- The first tourist festival
will be held in Qixian County, hometown to the so-called Jin Shang
-- a term for businessmen from north China's Shanxi province who
were renowned for their business acumen and diligence.
</P>
<P>
Business activities are expected to be held during the festival
from September 22 to 28.
</P>
<P>
Qixian County, located at the central Shanxi Basin south of the
provincial capital of Taiyuan, brought forth many business leaders
and businesses renowned through the Ming (1368-1644) and Qing
(1644-1911) dynasties from the mid 17th century to the beginning
of this century.
</P>
<P>
The Qiao Family Court Folk Customs Museum, a key tourist site
of human interest recommended during the festival, is built upon
the residence of a business dynasty with the family name of Qiao.
</P>
<P>
The residence displays the folk customs in central Shanxi
during the Ming and Qing dynasties, which has long been regarded
as typical of folk culture in the central part of China.
</P>
<P>
Qiao Family Court became a site of interest for tourists after
the showing of the internationally acclaimed film "Raise the Red
Lantern", which was shot in the house.
</P>
<P>
There are also many other scenic spots in the county such as
the Jiugou (Nine-Gully) Scenic Zone in Qixian county and the Jin
Shang Museum at Qu Famili Court.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the county government is expected to introduce some
projects to invite business in the fields of foodstuff, in-depth
processing of farm produce, tourism and real estate development.

<HEADLINE> Black Storks Found in Liaoning Province </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHENYANG, September 21 (Xinhua) -- Black storks, under top
class protection in China, have been found for the first time in
northeast China's Liaoning Province.
</P>
<P>
They were found in the Lushan Mountain Nature Reserve in
Jinzhou City west of the Bohai Bay.
</P>
<P>
In mid April this year, farmers living in the nature reserve
found three "big birds" with pink beaks and claws, black backs and
wings and reported it to the nature reserve administration, whose
workers found eight such birds altogether but could hardly
identify their species.
</P>
<P>
In late August, Prof. Liu Mingyu and Associate Prof. Wen
Shisheng of the Biology Department of Liaoning University
conducted a three-day field survey and identified the
birds as black storks.
</P>
<P>
According to Liu, there are only some 1,000 black storks in the
world, which are the verge of extinction, since their propagation
rate is very slow and their habitats are mainly in the marshland
and on cliffs in the northern Heilongjiang Province, northeast
China.
</P>
<P>
The storks build their nests and lay eggs in Lushan Reserve
because there are teemed with fish and shrimps in the creeks along
with dense protective forests, according to the professors.

SARAJEVO, September 20 (Xinhua) -- An independent international
organization monitoring the Bosnian elections said today that the
voter turnout in the Bosnian elections was "improbably high".
</P>

percent respectively, concluded the International Crisis Group

The conclusion was drawn after days of exhaustive counting of
the figures provided by the Organization for Security and

The conclusion has raised concerns of widespread fraud across
the country and the monitors demanded an investigation before
results were certified.

<HEADLINE> Thai Private Sector Encouraged to Invest in Education </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, September 21 (Xinhua) -- The Thai University Affairs
Ministry is looking at ways of encouraging the private sector to
invest in higher education, according to a senior official at the
ministry.
</P>
<P>
Thailand lags behind many other countries in the number of
university graduates, Kanok Wongtrangarn, deputy permanent
secretary of the University Affairs Ministry, was quoted today by
local daily the Bangkok Post as saying.
</P>
<P>
The ministry is to propose that the government allow the
private sector to set up universities in industrial zones in order
to ease the shortage of skilled labor.
</P>
<P>
Thailand will need 80,000 undergraduates a year over the next
24 years, especially in the fields of medicine and engineering, if
it is to keep up with other countries, Kanok said.
</P>
<P>
Only 14.5 percent of the Thai population have the chance to go
to university, compared with 40-50 percent in many
newly-industrialized nations, he said.
</P>
<P>
The private sector will need to be brought in, since ten
universities need to be set up every year over the next two
decades, he said.
</P>
<P>
The Thai government should also establish a fund for the
setting up of private universities and reduce taxes for firms
which subsidize higher education for their staff, he said.
</P>
<P>
The ministry is to propose in due course that the cabinet
increase the number of undergraduates in other fields including
languages, accountancy and education for the disabled.

<HEADLINE> Guangdong to Boost Property Sales </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, September 21 (Xinhua) -- Real estate developers and
industry administrators in South China's Guangdong Province have
teamed up to reinvigorate property sales, especially sales of
residential housing, China Daily reported today.
</P>
<P>
Experts have sensed that now is the best time to buy into the
market, the report quoted Li Honghui, the province's top official
in charge of real estate, as saying.
</P>
<P>
Li quoted Vice-Premier Zhu Rongji as saying that China's
overall economy is enjoying its best performance since mid-1993.
This, combined with the return of Hong Kong to China next year,
will give a strong shot in the arm to the property market.
</P>
<P>
Li said that Vice-Premier Zhu, along with other State leaders,
has expressed high hopes recently that a brisk real estate sector,
whose performance has a large impact on the prosperity of over 50
other industries, will spearhead the growth of the national
economy in the coming years, as the country tries to optimize its
industrial structure, the newspaper reported.
</P>
<P>
Local realtor were frustrated last year as sales posted a
historic low, the report quoted Li as saying.
</P>
<P>
But the market staged a strong comeback in the first half of
this year, with total floor space of sold property up 49 percent
and turnover rocketing 81 percent from a year ago, Li said.
</P>
<P>
The corresponding January-August growth rates in the provincial
capital of Guangzhou are 69.14 percent and 55.7 percent, said
Huang Qingkui, head of the property division of municipal
government.
</P>
<P>
To reduce inventory, local governments have decided in
principle to freeze all new land projects except for low-income
housing for the needy, Huang said.
</P>
<P>
Property inventory tapered off as a result, dropping by
one-half to 640,000 square meters at the end of June from 1.3
million square meters a year ago, he said.
</P>
<P>
Developers are likely to follow their administrators' advice to
cash in on the recovering market. Huang estimated that 70 percent
of residents in downtown Guangzhou have bought private homes,
while in four suburban counties the percentage is 95 percent.
</P>
<P>
Guangdong is set to encourage residents to buy private homes,
since many people are affluent enough to afford them, Huang said.

<HEADLINE> Vietnam to Control Tuberculosis and Lung Diseases </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HANOI, September 21 (Xinhua) -- Vietnam has set a target of
putting TB under control by the year 2000 and reducing the rate of
TB infection in the population to one per 100,000.
</P>
<P>
Some 130,000 people are infected with Tuberculosis in Vietnam
every year with half of them being pulmonary TB sufferers,
according to a latest official survey.
</P>
<P>
However, yearly identification of TB patients has reached
nearly 60 percent. The southern provinces are reported to have the
highest rate of TB sufferers in the country.
</P>
<P>
The survey shows that the number of TB infected patients who
are also Hiv-positive carriers made up half of the Hiv/Aids
carriers detected in the country.
</P>
<P>
People aged from 35 to 45 are seen as a high risk group for
TB. TB drugs, especially streptomyxin and rimifon, are now less
effective due to a high rate of usage, with resistancy in some
cases reaching as high as 35 per cent.
</P>
<P>
Vietnam has only three central hospitals and 19 provincial
hospitals specialising in TB treatment with 4,000 beds.
</P>
<P>
The medical personnel are not evenly distributed among regions,
with the south, where the TB incidence is the highest, having the
smallest number of TB doctors and lab workers. In mountain
provinces, the anti-TB programme is only active in towns or
densely-populated areas.
</P>
<P>
To overcome these shortcomings, the National Tuberculosis
Control Programme is attempting to combine its activities with
other health care programmes and aiming to detect 70 percent of
newly-infected TB patients with special attention directed to
hard-to-diagnosis forms such as TB in children, and Hiv/Aids
related TB.

<HEADLINE> Guatemala Wants to End Land Dispute With Belize </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MEXICO CITY, September 20 (Xinhua) -- Guatemalan Foreign
Minister Eduardo Stein said today that his country wants to put an
end to its 200-year old territorial dispute with Belize.
</P>
<P>
Reports from Guatemala City quote Stein as saying that the
territorial dispute with Belize will be tackled by his government
after the signing of the peace agreement with the Guatemalan
National Revolutionary Unit.
</P>
<P>
He said that the government of President Alvaro Arzu wants to
know if there is a will in Belize to discuss the matter and start
formal negotiations.
</P>
<P>
Official sources said Guatemala wants to solve the territorial
dispute with Belize before 2000.
</P>
<P>
Many Guatemalans consider that Belize, a country of 23,000
square kilometers and 195,000 inhabitants, belongs to Guatemala.
</P>
<P>
Belize won full independence in 1981, but Guatemala refused to
recognize the new nation and threatened war, prompting Britain to
send about 1,5000 troops to Belize to protect the nation's
sovereignty.
</P>
<P>
In 1991, the Guatemalan government of Jorge Serrano Elias
formally recognized Belize's independence. In return, Belize
agreed to limit its boundaries on the Caribbean and allow
Guatemala access to the ocean from the northern department of
Peten.
</P>
<P>
However, in 1994, Guatemala formally reinstated its territorial
claim over Belize in a letter to the United Nations, and so the
dispute continues.

Beijing-Guangzhou. The current average speed is 100 kilometres per
hour.
</P>
<P>
Ministry sources said speed-increase tests are being conducted
on rail lines in North China's Hebei Province, mainly focusing on
the Beijing-Qinhuangdao railway.
</P>
<P>
The Beijing-Shijiazhuang railway, a section on the
Beijing-Guangzhou line, is being upgraded, in preparation for the
soon-to-be-launched express service.
</P>
<P>
High-speed trains are also projected to run on rail lines from
Beijing to Tianjin, Shenyang and Jinan, at a speed of more than
150 kilometres per hour, ministry officials said.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the Ministry of Railways is considering raising the
speed of cargo trains on two sections of
railway: Beijing-Shanhaiguan and Beijing-Shenyang.
</P>
<P>
The ministry plans to raise the speed of cargo trains to about
90km/h from the current speed of 60-70km/h, in the coming few
years.
</P>
<P>
Experts predict that in the near future a nationwide fast
railway transit network will take shape, promising ideal transport
for both passengers and cargo.
</P>
<P>
In recent years, competition from the highway and air transport
sectors has been increasing sharply, threatening the traditionally
dominant role of railways in China's passenger and cargo transport.
</P>
<P>
In an attempt to ease the problem, the ministry has opened fast
speed trains on the railways of Shanghai-Nanjing and
Beijing-Qinhuangdao earlier this year, achieving the highest
travelling speeds of more than 170 kilometres an hour.
</P>
<P>
The first quasi-express railway from Guangzhou to Shenzhen went
into operation in 1994 and trains can run at 160 km/h.

<HEADLINE> World's Biggest Ecological Project For Black Soil  (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CHANGCHUN, September 21 (Xinhua) -- Vast tracts of rain-eroded
wasteland in northeast China has been turned into fertile fields
crisscrossed with irrigation ditches and canals, in a black soil
belt protection project, referred to as the "world's biggest
ecological project" by American eco-economists.
</P>
<P>
Nine years ago, the people of Baiquan County, in Heilongjiang
Province, launched a campaign to solve the problem of eroded black
soil on 133,000 hectares, planting various kinds of trees and
building terraced fields on mountain slopes.
</P>
<P>
"China has controlled the decrease of organic substances and
fertility of black soil, and in some places fertility has gone up
and the soil become richer," said Sun Hongde, director of the
National Monitoring Center for Black Soil Fertility.
</P>
<P>
Experts hold that China leads the world in harnessing black
soil erosion, in its northeastern plain between Songhua and
Nengjiang rivers, and sources from the Ministry of Agriculture say
that protection of black soil has not only allowed the plain and
Jilin province to play a growing role in grain production, but has
influenced two other black soil belts in the world, in the United
States and Ukraine.
</P>
<P>
The two provinces plan to increase commercial grain output by
12.5 million tons, a quarter of China's planned total grain
increase (50 million tons), by the end of the century.
</P>
<P>
Northeast China has become the most important grain producer
and plays a pivotal role in the country's agriculture,
particularly in grain production, Vice-premier Jiang Chunyun, who
is in charge of China's agriculture, once said.
</P>
<P>
The black soil belt there covers an area of at least 10 million
hectares. More than seven million hectares have been cultivated so
far.
</P>
<P>
The black earth, which is 30 to 100 cm thick, is the richest in
the country, and is appropriate for growing wheat, corn, and
soybeans.

<P>
China began cultivating its black soil much earlier than the US
and Ukraine, paying inadequate attention to ecological protection
-- until the central government set up a fertility monitoring
center for black soil and fertility efficiency in Jilin Provincial
Academy of Agricultural Sciences in 1989.
</P>
<P>
Since then, both Heilongjiang and jilin provinces have
especially formulated measures to protect the black soil. Trees
and grass have been planted in the wasteland to form a strong
forest defense.
</P>
<P>
In Heilongjiang Province, regulations on soil protection were
formulated to stop erosion caused by cultivation and
construction. Signs were put up to remind people not to do
anything detrimental to the black earth.
</P>
<P>
Scientists have also been called on to work out still more
effective ways to tap black land, and experts at the Chinese
Academy of Sciences have developed a complete set of measures to
improve fertility of black soil. In a 635,000-hectare area, the
content of organic matters has risen up to eight percent, from
three percent seven years ago.
</P>
<P>
Farmers in the black soil belt have become increasingly aware
of the importance of farming scientificly, using less chemical
fertilizer and practicing crop rotation, producing high yields but
not losing much fertility.
</P>
<P>
"Land can feed men before men feed the land," said Xu Biao, a
local farmer from Xinfu Village in Suihua, where farmers used only
organic fertilizer in their 2,000-hectare black land and reaped a
record soybean harvest of some 3,000 kilograms per hectare.
</P>
<P>
Local officials noted that protection of black soil has had
both economic and ecological returns. In Heilongjiang and Jilin,
grain output over the past decade has increased by more than 10
million tons every year, and grain output of the black soil, which
accounts for 60 percent of the total acreage of the two provinces'
farmland, is about 70 percent of the total.
</P>
<P>
However, it still has to take a long time and unending efforts
to stop black soil erosion and a decrease in fertility, but China
has made great progress in this regard, experts said.

<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, September 20 (Xinhua) -- Italy got a good start in the
Davis Cup tennis semi-finals when they won the two opening singles
over France in Nantes, France on Friday.
</P>
<P>
In the two singles matches, Andrea Gaudenzi beat Cedric Pioline
5-7, 6-1, 7-6 (7/4), 6-3 and Renzo Furlan downed Arnaud Boetsch
5-7, 6-1, 3-6, 6-7 (5/7).
</P>
<P>
While in the Sweden-Czech Republic semifinal showdown,
30-year-old Stefan Edberg beat Daniel Vacek 7-6 (7-2), 7-5, 4-6,
6-3 to give Sweden a 2-0 lead in Prague. Earlier an impressive
Thomas Enqvist beat former French Open finalist Petr Korda 6-4,
6-3, 7-6 (11/9).
</P>
<P>
In the World Group qualifying round clashes, Croatia ended the
day 2-0 down to the Australians at home. The visitors' hero was
Jason Stoltenberg who beat big-serving Goran Ivanisevic in a
five-set thriller.
</P>
<P>
Earlier Mark Philippoussis dropped only seven games in the
opening singles against Sasa Hirszon.
</P>
<P>
Austria squandered their chance of taking a 2-0 first-day lead
in their Davis Cup World Group qualifying group clash against
Brazil in Sao Paulo and ended up sharing honours at 1-1.
</P>
<P>
Thomas Muster powered his way to a 6-3, 6-3, 6-3 victory over
home player Fernando Meligeni but then his comptriot Markus Hipfl
let slip a two sets to love lead against Gustavo Kuerten, lost two
tie-breaks in which he didn't win a point, and finally
surrendered 6-4, 6-3, 6-7 (0/7), 6-7 (0/7), 1-6.
</P>
<P>
Rain held up Belgium and Spain while injury pinned back the
Netherlands.
</P>
<P>
In Bucharest, Belgium made a bright start when Johan Van Herck
defeated Adrian Voinea 6-7 (6/8), 6-4, 6-2, 6-1 while in
Tarragona, Alberto Costa gave Spain a winning start against
Denmark by overwhelming Fredrik Fetterlein 6-0, 6-0, 6-2. Rain
then postponed the second singles until Saturday.
</P>
<P>
Wimbledon champion Richard Krajicek, leading 6-7 (5/7), 6-3,
6-4, 1-4, had to pull out of his match against New Zealander
Alistair Hunt because of a knee injury.
</P>
<P>
The result left the two sides level-pegging. Jan Siemerink
earlier defeated Brett Steven in an exciting five-set marathon.
</P>
<P>
In the other qualifying showdowns, Russia took their expected
2-0 lead over Hungary in Moscow, although their French Open
champion Yevgeny Kafelnikov surprisingly dropped a set to Attila
Savolt, and Marc Rosset and Jakob Hlasek both scored victories in
Olten to give Switzerland a comfortable 2-0 lead against Morocco.
</P>
<P>
There was drama and nostalgia at Wimbledon where Britain,
playing Egypt in the Euro/Africa Zone Group two, took a 2-0 lead.
</P>
<P>
Tim Henman and Greg Rusedski both won their opening singles in
straight-sets.

<HEADLINE> Regulators to Tighten B-share Supervision </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, September 21 (Xinhua) -- China is expected to
strengthen the management of its B-share securities market for
overseas investors to promote its healthy growth, today's "China
daily" quoted a spokesman with the China Securities Regulatory
Commission (CSRC) as saying.
</P>
<P>
The spokesman made the speech yesterday after the Shanghai and
Shenzhen stock exchanges issued notices to rectify the problem of
investors who fail to meet the criteria for opening B-share
accounts.
</P>
<P>
A large number of of domestic investors have opened B-share
accounts in Shenzhen, causing abnormal fluctuations in the B-share
market.
</P>
<P>
The spokesman said that selecting certain domestic enterprises
to be listed as B-shares is a beneficial experiment to utilize
foreign funds and expand the development of the securities market.
</P>
<P>
China will continue to make various measures to boost the
B-share market.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, China will encourage more State-owned enterprises to
be listed in Hong Kong to develop the securities markets of both
the mainland and Hong Kong, CSRC Chairman Zhou Daojiong told the
21st annual meeting of International Organization of Securities
Commissions, which ended yesterday in Montreal, Canada.
</P>
<P>
"Chinese securities authorities will take active steps to
co-operate with Hong Kong securities watchdog bodies and stock
exchanges to strengthen the supervision of companies listed in
Hong Kong," he said.
</P>
<P>
Currently, 22 companies from the mainland are listed in Hong
Kong.
</P>
<P>
Zhou said CSRC will supervise listed enterprises' use of funds
and make sure they report comprehensive, timely and accurate
company information to upgrade their operation and management.
</P>
<P>
He noted that with the approach of 1997, economic ties between
the mainland and HongKong are becoming closer, which is an
important factor in promoting the development of both sides.
</P>
<P>
At the conference, Zhou also said the current tasks for Chinese
securities institutions focus on market supervision and
cultivation.
</P>
<P>
China will speed up the formulation of securities law and
severely punish market violators to protect the rights of
investors.
</P>
<P>
"To foster the securities market will help enterprises generate
funds and transform their operational system," he said
</P>
<P>
Zhou said the current financial system focuses on indirect
fund-raising and that banks play the principal role in extending
capital for social demands.
</P>
<P>
But the ration of direct fund-raising should be gradually
raised, he said.
</P>
<P>
Chinese savings saw an average increase of 450 billion yuan (54
billion US dollars) annually from 1991-95, while listed companies
raise 15 billion yuan (1.8 billion US dollars) in the stock market
each year between 1993 and 1996.
</P>
<P>
Part of the savings should flow into the securities market to
set up rational fund-raising structures, Zhou said.

<HEADLINE> Leading Companies to Upgrade Capital's Tourism </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, September 21 (Xinhua) -- Leading tourist enterprises
in Beijing jointly proposed a series of activities to promote
merchandise quality and service standards in the capital's tourism
on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The heads of seven famous designated tourism enterprises which
are often patronized by foreigners called for united actions in
Beijing's tourist industry, China Daily reported today.
</P>
<P>
The seven enterprises include the Beijing Toronto Hotel, the
Great Wall Sheraton Hotel, the Lufthansa Friendship Store, Rong
Bao Zhai, the Beijing Hotel, the Yuanlong Silk Co. Ltd. and the
Friendship Store Group.
</P>
<P>
They stressed the need for concrete measures to fully guarantee
the legitimate rights of tourists as consumers, the report said.
</P>
<P>
They suggested that all tourist shopping centers rigorously
enforce rules and regulations related to service, and set up
quality supervision systems, in keeping with the government laws
and decrees to safeguard the quality of tourism commodities and
services.
</P>
<P>
They also suggested that to ensure the success of the upcoming
"China '97 International Sightseeing Year," all tourism
enterprises in Beijing voluntarily adhere to business ethics, by
being honest and sincere to every customer and by protecting
consumers' rights.
</P>
<P>
Beijing, a time-honored city with splendid culture and rich
tourism resources, has attracted millions of domestic and foreign
visitors.
</P>
<P>
But, problems in the tourist industry have cropped up, severely
damaging Beijing's image as an international tourist city. And for
some time, fake and low quality tourist commodities and
unsatisfactory service have discouraged visitors, especially
foreigners.

<HEADLINE> China Will Never Pose Threat to Others: Qian </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CHICAGO, September 20 (Xinhua) -- China will not pose a threat
to others even when it becomes stronger and more developed in the
future, said Chinese Vice Premier and Foreign Minister Qian Qichen
here today.
</P>
<P>
"Our security policy and military strategy are of a defensive
nature," Qian said while addressing a luncheon hosted by the
Chicago Council on Foreign Relations at the Mid-America Club in
Chicago.
</P>
<P>
China's spending on arms, in per capita terms, is among the
lowest in the world, Qian said, adding that even in absolute
terms, the figure is still the lowest among the major powers.
Compared with the United States and Japan, China's military outlay
is much smaller, he said.
</P>
<P>
He said China announced a unilateral cut of its military force
by 1 million men as far back as 10 years ago. It also signed the
Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty and is committed to complete
prohibition and thorough destruction of nuclear weapons, he added.
</P>
<P>
"China is the only nuclear-weapon state that undertakes not to
be the first to use nuclear weapons against non-nuclear-weapon
states of nuclear-free zones," Qian said.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese leader said, "When we seek the return of Hong Kong
and Macao and the early peaceful reunification of Taiwan with the
mainland, we are talking about China's inherent territory, an
issue that bears on China's sovereignty and territorial
integrity."
</P>
<P>
He said, "We have not threatened anyone; nor have we claimed a
single inch of land of other countries."
</P>
<P>
It is reasonable, justifiable and perfectly legitimate for the
1.2 billion Chinese people to demand an end to national split and
an early reunification of the motherland, he said.
</P>
<P>
"What must be pointed out in this connection is that it is
China's sovereignty and territorial integrity that have been
constantly under threat and violation from the outside," noted
Qian.

<HEADLINE> China, US Should Develop Stable Ties: Qian </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Chicago, September 20 (Xinhua) -- China and the United States
should cultivate and develop a stable, healthy and constructive
relationship as the two countries have broad common interests,
Chinese Vice Premier and Foreign Minister Qian Qichen said here
today.
</P>
<P>
As permanent members of the U.N. Security Council and major
nuclear powers, China and the United States share a great
responsibility for the maintenance of regional and world peace and
stability, prevention of nuclear proliferation and a series of
other issues bearing on universal security of the international
community, said Qian in a speech at a luncheon hosted by the
Chicago Council on Foreign Relations at the Mid-America Club in
Chicago.
</P>
<P>
As the largest developing country and the largest developed
country, China and the United States are highly complementary
economically and enjoy great potential in trade and economic
cooperation, he noted.
</P>
<P>
And also the two countries, as APEC members, will serve the
fundamental interests of their peoples and greater regional and
global prosperity by cultivating an open and healthy international
economic environment, the Chinese vice premier said.
</P>
<P>
Qian added that the two countries also have common interests in
cracking down on international crimes, drug trafficking, illegal
immigration and international terrorism. And they have a broad
vista in their cooperation on environmental protection and energy
development, he said.
</P>
<P>
But, Qian, who is also China's foreign minister, said, that
regrettably, the relations between the two countries in recent
years have been ridden with difficulties and troubles. "Hardly has
one wave subsided when another arises," he said.
</P>
<P>
He said, "Such state of affairs has made it impossible for us
to concentrate on advancing our shared interests and has hampered
our ability to bring out the full potential of our relations."
</P>
<P>
Qian noted that the question of Taiwan has been most disruptive
and most damaging to China-U.S. relations.
</P>
<P>
He said that the Taiwan question is one of China's sovereignty,
territorial integrity and its great cause of national
reunification.
</P>
<P>
"There has been no change to the Chinese government's policy on
the Taiwan question and it will stay that way," said Qian.
</P>
<P>
"We will continue to handle the cross-Straits relations and
promote peaceful reunification in accordance with the principles
of `peaceful reunification' and `one country, two systems' and the
eight-point proposal by President Jiang Zemin early last year,"
the Chinese leader said.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese government will not give up the option of force in
settling the Taiwan question, he said. "This is not targeted
against the Taiwan people, but against separatist activities on
the island and intervention by outside forces."
</P>
<P>
Qian stressed that the foundation of China-U.S. relations is
the three joint communiques, which also serve as the guiding
principles for handling the Taiwan question.
</P>
<P>
"To say that the three joint communiques are out of date and to
supersede the Communique of August 17 with the `Taiwan Relations
Act' are wrong and highly detrimental," Qian said.
</P>
<P>
He pointed out that the ups and downs in recent years show
clearly that if the Taiwan question is handled properly,
China-U.S. relations will progress smoothly; if not, they will
suffer setbacks or even serious retrogression.
</P>
<P>
Qian said that the Chinese government attaches importance to
the renewed pledge of American leaders that they will pursue a
"one China" policy and observe the three joint communiques.
</P>
<P>
"We hope the U.S. side can honor these commitments with
concrete deeds, properly handle the Taiwan question with caution
and refrain from allowing this question to become an obstacle to
the growth of our relations," said Qian.
</P>
<P>
Qian said that with joint efforts of the two sides, China-U.S.
relations have made some progress. "We want to continue enhancing
trust, reducing trouble, promoting cooperation and avoiding
confrontation" with the U.S. side, Qian said.

<HEADLINE> At Least 1 Killed in House Explosion in Lyon, France </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, September 20 (Xinhua) -- At least one man was killed and
eight were wounded in the explosion of a running down three-story
house in an old district of Lyon this afternoon.
</P>
<P>
Firemen discovered by 22:00 p.m. local time the body of a man
around 50 years old in the debris of the house, which was torn
down by the explosion reportedly caused by gas leakage around
13:50 p.m.
</P>
<P>
Rescuers are continuing their search for more possible victims
because several people could have been buried under the ruins,
said Regis Guyot, prefect of Rhone in charge of security affairs.
</P>
<P>
Two people were injured by jumping from the windows, and six
others were burnt in various degrees. All of them were dispatched
to a hospital after the explosion.
</P>
<P>
Several apartments of the building were unoccupied, but people
have sighted some squatters there recently. This could mean that
there are more people buried under the debris, said a spokeswoman
for the prefecture of Rhone.
</P>
<P>
A team of psychologists arrived at the scene to help the
relatives of the victims.

<HEADLINE> Le Pen "Solemnly" Asks Juppe to Resign </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, September 20 (Xinhua) -- Jean-Marie Le Pen, president of
the far-right National Front (FN), today said that he "solemnly"
asks Prime Minister Alain Juppe to resign because the latter "no
longer has the credit to conduct the government of France."
</P>
<P>
Le Pen made the declaration one day after Juppe denounced him
in public as "profoundly, almost innermostly a racist,
anti-Semitist and xenophobe."
</P>
<P>
The FN president said at a press conference that it is evident
that the prime minister "acts without possession of any capability
or balance needed for the conduct of the government."
</P>
<P>
He described the denouncement made by Juppe as "a lightheaded
intervention" which makes up a "real call for lynching" against
him.
</P>
<P>
Le Pen also denied that he is a racist, a term used by an
overwhelming majority of French political figures to describe him.
</P>
<P>
"I am not a racist, I am not an anti-racist," said the
68-year-old FN leader.

<HEADLINE> Scientists Identify Gene Linked to Breast Cancer </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Washington, September 20 (Xinhua) -- Researchers have
identified a gene that changes estrogen into a form that may
contribute to DNA damage resulting in cancer, according to a news
report from the Johns Hopkins Health System.
</P>
<P>
For a long time, scientists have associated the carcinogenicity
of estrogens to their role as the activator of the estrogen
receptor. However, this research furthers the proposal that there
may be a second pathway by which estrogens can cause breast
cancer.
</P>
<P>
Thomas Sutter, assistant professor of the Johns Hopkins School
of Public Health, said, "Women are exposed to estrogen earlier and
are living longer. This expanded exposure raises the risk of
something going wrong in the process the estrogen regulation."
</P>
<P>
The gene, P4501B1, identified by the research group plays a
role in endrocrine regulation and the toxicity of estrogens.
</P>
<P>
"Having identified the gene, we can now sort out its role in
he pathway." Dr. Sutter added. The gene appears to activate a
variety of environmental carcinogens.

<HEADLINE> Nigerian Head of State Stresses "One-China" </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ABUJA, September 20 (Xinhua) -- Nigeria has persistently
pursued the "one-China" policy and will not establish official
relations with Taiwan, General Sani Abacha, Nigeria's head of
state, said here today.
</P>
<P>
In a meeting with Luo Gan, visiting state councillor and
secretary-general of China's State Council, Abacha said both
Nigeria and China take the stand of non-interference in the
internal affairs of other countries, which is a very important
foundation for the development of bilateral relations between the
two countries.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, both countries have been trying to maintain the
unique characteristics of their respective cultures, Abacha
noted.
</P>
<P>
Abacha emphasized that China, which is vigorously accelerating
economic development, has advanced technologies while Nigeria
boasts rich natural resources. It will benefit the two countries
if they strengthen economic ties and expand bilateral trade.
</P>
<P>
Nigeria and China have enjoyed a true friendship since they
established diplomatic relations 25 years ago, Abacha said,
adding that both countries should further promote the development
of the relations on this sound basis.
</P>
<P>
In response, the Chinese state councillor said China and
Nigeria have supported and assisted each other in both
international affairs and national economic construction in the
past years, and the cooperation is satisfactory.
</P>
<P>
China appreciates Nigeria's stand of pursuing the "one-China"
policy, Luo said, reiterating that China has always stuck to
the principle of non-interference in the internal affairs of
other countries in handling country-to-country relations.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, China respects Nigeria's choice of the political
system and development road according to its own conditions, said
Luo who arrived here on September 19 for an official goodwill
visit at the invitation of the Nigerian government.
</P>
<P>
Luo, the highest Chinese official to visit Nigeria over the
recent two years, praised Nigeria for its important role in
handling African affairs, especially in safeguarding peace and
stability in the west African sub-region.

<HEADLINE> China Works for World Peace, Stability: Qian </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Chicago, September 20 (Xinhua) -- China will continue to work
for maintaining world peace and stability, facilitating
international economic cooperation and promoting the common
prosperity of mankind, Chinese Vice-Premier Qian Qichen said here
today.
</P>
<P>
Addressing a luncheon hosted by the Chicago Council on Foreign
Relations at the Mid-America Club in Chicago, Qian, who is also
China's foreign minister, noted that the present-day world is
undergoing profound changes in the wake of the Cold War.
</P>
<P>
The international situation is, on the whole, moving towards
relaxation and the trend of multipolarization is gathering
momentum, he said, adding that more and more countries have
focused their top priority on economic development and attached
increasing importance to cooperation on trans-regional and global
issues.
</P>
<P>
"Political and economic interactions between states and between
various regions of the world have become closer and more dynamic
than ever before," said Qian, who arrived here this morning after
winding up a four-day officials visit to Canada.
</P>
<P>
However, Qian said, the world is still full of clashing
interests, instabilities and uncertainties, local conflicts and
wars keep cropping up, and the gap between the rich and poor
countries continues to widen. Compounded by such ills as
international terrorism, drug trafficking, illegal immigration,
crime and environmental degradation, the very survival and
sustainable development of mankind are at serious risk, he said.
</P>
<P>
Qian stressed China's independent foreign policy of peace and
said that China is ready to develop friendly relations and
cooperation with all countries in the world on the basis of the
Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence.
</P>
<P>
Reiterating China's position, Qian said, state-to-state
relations should be based truly on the spirit of the U.N. Charter
and the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence. "Countries should
respect each other, seek common ground while setting aside
differences, engage in cooperation on an equal footing, resolve
their disputes through dialogue and negotiation and refrain from
resorting to sanctions, force or containment," he said.
</P>
<P>
As a permanent member of the U.N. Security Council, Qian said,
China is fully aware of its responsibility for advancing world
peace and stability and has always been working towards this end.

<HEADLINE> US, Japan to Study Possibility of Off-Shore Heliport </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, September 20 (Xinhua) -- The United States and
Japan began to study the possibility of creating a floating
off-shore facility to base some U.S. Marine Corps helicopters now
stationed on Okinawa, U.S. officials said today.
</P>
<P>
The move came after the two countries made a decision on
relocation of U.S. troops on Okinawa during a two-day
cabinet-level meeting in Washington.
</P>
<P>
The floating off-shore facility, or called heliport, is one of
the three options being considered as part of the effort to adjust
the American military presence on Okinawa, where the anti-American
feeling among Okinawan residents is strong.
</P>
<P>
The other two ideas involve establishing heliports at other
local bases on Okinawa, such as Kadena air base or Camp Schwab.
</P>
<P>
Gen. Charles Krulak, the four-star commandant of the Marine
Corps, told reporters that the floating platform was one of the
several ideas under study.
</P>
<P>
"We ought to look at it, it has potential. It's the type of
thinking (about the future) that we ought to be doing," he said.
</P>
<P>
On Thursday, Defense Secretary William Perry said, "The vision
in me hopes that this floating off-shore facility will be the
solution." He was speaking at a joint news conference after he and
Secretary of State Warren Christopher held a meeting with Japanese
Foreign Affairs Minister Yukihiko Ikeda and Hideo Usui,
director-general of the Japanese Defense Agency.
</P>
<P>
One of the factors that favors the off-shore idea is that it
would not require the construction of new buildings on Okinawa,
which, once decided on, would provoke another wave of protests
from among Okinawan residents.
</P>
<P>
But the cost for creating the off-shore platform is another
factor, and there are no precise cost estimates offered by both
countries.
</P>
<P>
Reports in the japanese media have put the tab at 2 billion to
3 billion dollars. Japan would pick up many of the costs for the
establishment as it has always done for basing U.S. forces in the
country.
</P>
<P>
Kurt Campbell, deputy assistant secretary of defense for Asia
and Pacific affairs, told reporters that the off-shore facility is
a relatively new conceptual option which was developed in the last
few weeks in close consultation between the United States and
Japan.
</P>
<P>
A joint technical working group has been formed so that
officials from both countries will be able to begin studying
whether the option is feasible, he said.
